<P><EM>&gt; The contemporary cultural relativist denies the existence of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  any &quot;privileged&quot; cultural viewpoint, but espouses the primacy of culture.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Having abandoned the MORAL foundation of individual autonomy, the cultural 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  relativist can't resolve the paradox you identify, 
</EM><BR>
<P>IMO, cultural relativism is a parlor game. So is rejecting it. No one's 
<BR>
abandoned morals, they are just being f**cking overly polite and apologetic. 
<BR>
Call it liberal white guilt, let's be up front about it. Who really cares 
<BR>
about ebonics, tongue piercing, or polygamy?  
<BR>
<P>The issues you raise are serious ones, but they aren't about culture, they 
<BR>
are about religious fanaticism.
<BR>
<P>What I get maddest at is the politeness and respect shown by all sorts of 
<BR>
intellectuals towards religions. People will protest genetic corn, but not 
<BR>
people-killing religion.
<BR>
<P>Anything spiritual is sacred, it's all OK ... it cannot be talked about ... 
<BR>
it cannot be attacked. It cannot be renounced, it's not POLITE. The cultural 
<BR>
relativists are not really to blame, nor the failure of educators. When we 
<BR>
get the 'cultural balls' to denounce all those sick and perverted practices 
<BR>
that are the result of f**cked up religious crackpot ideas, then maybe some 
<BR>
honesty will surface.  Maybe someone will get mad enough to stop all this 
<BR>
abusive stuff. 
<BR>
<P>As is, we are doomed to allowing all kinds of barbarous practices in the name 
<BR>
of religion. Ooops - I can't talk bad about your religion.... even you 
<BR>
atheists get mad if you get attacks on your beliefs. arghhhhh
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nadia.  In fact, the most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  radical post-modernists deny the existence of the paradox at all, claiming 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that it arises from making what they call the &quot;mistake&quot; of accepting any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  particular viewpoint as &quot;privileged&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah. Hmm... Being judgmental and saying we are better off is just honest, 
<BR>
and it's not PC (God forbid) but it won't do anything that being PC and 
<BR>
accepting other cultures does. 
<BR>
<P>Except in the art world, where cultural values are essential to the mix, 
<BR>
these views are just masturbatory mental exercises. The fact is, exposure to 
<BR>
other world views is what matters -- and education. Good mental hygiene. We 
<BR>
send doctors in to see that people get vaccines, when will we devlope a good 
<BR>
'meme-vaccine' ;o)?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Once people see how it is in a first world culture, it is hard NOT to want 
<BR>
to eat well, sleep safely in one's home, enjoy rights and privileges. 
<BR>
However, the cultures that often suffer the most from &quot;backwards&quot; i.e. 
<BR>
fundamentalist beliefs, eschew the modern books, sort of like how our own 
<BR>
anti-Darwinists refute the concept of evolution and won't allow their 
<BR>
children to read science.  
<BR>
I watch Jerry Springer........
<BR>
<P>So how does one who is committed to non-force make someone read and accept 
<BR>
reasonably unbiased information? How does one educate a populace? Something 
<BR>
like Mao's cultural revolution is out of the question. Aside from tying up 
<BR>
hundreds of people  and  injecting them with truth serum and putting walkmans 
<BR>
with eductaional tapes on their heads, how can you help a world that says: 
<BR>
&quot;we don't want to know&quot;? Especially with fanatical religious groups. One of 
<BR>
the most frustrating practices I know of is clitorectomies in Ethiopia, is 
<BR>
enforced by women themselves, who are so steeped in the culture that they tie 
<BR>
their daughters to tables so they can be mutilated. It's gross!! But I have 
<BR>
an Ethiopian friend who runs a women's shelter over there, and has been 
<BR>
working with that issue ...and she gets death threats...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Ultimately, this &quot;paradox&quot; is a false one, and arises from a mistaken 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  conflation of description and prescription.  Post-modernist 
</EM><BR>
&quot;sophistication&quot; 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  is nothing more than the stubborn refusal to acknowledge this error.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, it's nothing more than intellectual Floohflah. Post modernist or not, 
<BR>
accepting or not, we have to face up to the fact that while fundamentalists 
<BR>
have control over politics, it's not getting better for women, religious 
<BR>
genocide, whatever... and in many places it is getting worse.
