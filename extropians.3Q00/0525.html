<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  The question is really about philosophical principles, can one advocate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  transhumanism while sharing stasist views upon society?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely. And people do. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Such a person will not be in 100% accord with the Extropian principles that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Max has set forth, but they can be in accord with their own. And this should 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be a call to begin wars and name calling! We've witnessed the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fruitlessness of that all too often. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's not hide behind diversity as an excuse for an 'anything goes'
<BR>
approach to transhumanism. If we say that no matter how inconsistent,
<BR>
how impractical and how abhorrent a view is it can still be
<BR>
transhumanism if it accepts some parts of what we currently consider a
<BR>
transhumanist agenda, then we will not have any use of our diversity
<BR>
of view because there will be no view left. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Sure, those transhumanists advocate state sponsored life extension
<BR>
treatments but only for party members, while *those* transhumanists
<BR>
believe in the imminent eschaton where the omega-angels will upload us
<BR>
into the astral planes, and yes, that group of transhumanists think
<BR>
that we should use genetic engineering to become neanderthals again
<BR>
and return to nature. But *my* kind of transhumanists do not want
<BR>
that!&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Philosophical convictions about economics, spiritual and ethical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerns about computers/biotech/AI will often arrive at differing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solutions for social concerns - in other words, all the complicated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues are not resolved. We must expect divergent experiential and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political views. If they do not concur with YOUR particular brand of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasoning, the best you can do is try to show the offending person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you are correct. You cannot expect all transhumanists to view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things in a way you find axiomatic.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem Waldemar tries to point out is that right now we cannot
<BR>
even do that. Sure, we can have a debate about guns, taxes or the best
<BR>
way of financing research - but that debate will not be based on
<BR>
transhumanist principles. Instead it will almost by necessity be based
<BR>
on other philosophical or political systems and we get just a rehash
<BR>
of the same old debates we hear elsewhere. How often do we read
<BR>
someone discussing how different economic policies fit the extropian
<BR>
principles? Here we should let ourselves be led by reason and
<BR>
transhumanist ideas rather than our previous political
<BR>
convictions. But that means we need to develop our basic transhumanist
<BR>
core philosophy further.
<BR>
<P>We need to relate transhumanism to the here and now. That will of
<BR>
course get messy and I agree that we will likely not reach neat
<BR>
consensus on everything. But we cannot say that all views are equally
<BR>
good or equally transhumanist, just as we cannot say that
<BR>
transhumanism should not deal with current or near-future politics -
<BR>
that will only play into the hands of other, anti- or
<BR>
non-transhumanist ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Diversity is to be expected.
</EM><BR>
<P>Strength through diversity!
<BR>
<P>Unity through strength!
<BR>
<P>Unity - Strength - Mass!
<BR>
<P>:-)
