<EM>&gt; Yes, the big impact of nanotech on the economy that I can forsee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to make most consumer products more like software, music, movies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drugs, airlines, and education are now: full of complex price discrimination.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you underestimate the significance of the software model. By
<BR>
the time we have nanotech, the lesson of open source will have sunk in;
<BR>
we can't assume that, just because physical products are replicatable the
<BR>
way software is, that the development of nanotech-mediated manufacturing
<BR>
will resemble today's software industry.
<BR>
<P>Example: France, Germany, China, are beginning to to move -- at a
<BR>
governmental level -- to push proprietary software out of government
<BR>
offices and publicy-owned enterprises; they're switching to open source
<BR>
software or open standards instead. They're doing this not because
<BR>
they're necessarily anti-business, but because they view software as
<BR>
strategic infrastructure, and they don't want to be held to ransom by
<BR>
foreign corporations. (Who might, for example, triple their royalty
<BR>
charges without notice, or discontinue support for a critical piece of
<BR>
equipment -- and who cannot be held to account. The hope is that even
<BR>
if the developers of an open source package go nuts, they won't be able
<BR>
to stop the government from continuing to pay for maintainance, _or_
<BR>
force them to upgrade every computer they own to run Windows 2000 even
<BR>
though there's no requirement for its additional features.)
<BR>
<P>Anyway ...
<BR>
<P>What if a currently socialist (and I mean _moderate_ socialist -- national
<BR>
healthcare and insurance and high income tax democracy -- rather than
<BR>
totalitarian) government decides that access to food, basic manufactured
<BR>
goods, and so on for all their citizens is a similar strategic necessity?
<BR>
In past times they'd have had to steal such resources from other people,
<BR>
but with nanotech replicators they can let the good times roll, up to a
<BR>
point. To do this, all they need to do is give cash donations to some
<BR>
nanotech equivalent of the Free Software Foundation, with a remit to
<BR>
design templates for all the necessities of life. Want a new Ford? Ford
<BR>
want $10K off you -- but the Free Hardware Foundation GNU Automobile
<BR>
project is being developed essentially for free, they've got big donations
<BR>
from several smallish countries who don't _like_ seeing their foreign
<BR>
exchange vanishing into the pockets of Ford's US shareholders, and you can
<BR>
have a GNU Automobile for the cost of materials and energy -- under $1K.
<BR>
<P>This suggests to me that a nanotech system could allow currently
<BR>
backward countries -- albeit with some infrastructure; I'm thinking of
<BR>
poorer parts of eastern Europe or South America rather than Africa --
<BR>
to catch up to current Western standards of living extremely rapidly,
<BR>
and in a way that makes socialism popular among their citizens.
