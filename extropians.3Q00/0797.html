<EM>&gt; &gt; Not everyone. I for example, have not kept health insurance in over ten years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have not had any health problems that a trip to the local drug store and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bed rest could not cure. I estimate I have saved over $25,000.00 in insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; premiums in that time. I know that insurance, private or public, is merely a con
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; game to get healthy people like me to pay for other people's problems. Now I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; going to be painted as a cruel, cruel, and selfishly mean person for living this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; way. Too bad. Its my money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I certainly don't begrudge your choice, and I'm sure I'm one of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who has paid a lot more in premiums than I ever got in benefits--even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after the MRI, ENG, and other tests and drugs I got for my Meniere's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Disease (maybe about $3-4000).  I do pay cash for dental work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I would point out that health insurance is not /entirely/ a scam
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or redistribution system.  As much as Rand would hate to admit it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shit happens.  There really are completely random events that can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost people hundreds of thousands of dollars; even the healthiest,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most conscientious people.  Nothing in Kennita's lifestyle, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, caused her MS--she just happened to be the one.  You or I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be next.  I prefer to think of health insurance as a hedged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bet; sure the house percentage is high if you're healthy, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system as a whole may encourage unhealthful practices, but I still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want the hedge, because losing the bet is a killer.
</EM><BR>
<P>If insurance were truly a fair bet, it would account for my healthy state in my
<BR>
premiums. That it doesn't indicates that its a scam. Yes, shit does happen.
<BR>
However there are people that shit tends not to happen to. Insurance forms, for
<BR>
example, do not ask the ages or dates of birth and death of your ancestors, so
<BR>
they totally leave out any possibility for people with healthy and long lived
<BR>
genomes to realize benefits from their natural state. Insurance policies also do
<BR>
not account for your past health history. 
<BR>
<P>Some on the list will say I'm not following the social contract, blah blah blah.
<BR>
The social contract is typically a piece of paper they hold over your eyes while
<BR>
they are going for your wallet.
