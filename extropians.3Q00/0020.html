<EM>&gt; Armuchee?  With the big swimming pool, lake, horseback rides, etc.?

<P>Never heard of it.  Whenever I asked anyone there about entertainment

possibilites, they tried to get me to join their church.  Evidently, I was

asking the wrong people.  Or they have gotten *very* good over the years

at maintaining their cover...

<P>Say, where did all the black people live?  I was shocked when I discovered
<BR>
that Floyd County was 40 % black because I never *saw* them.  I thought it
<BR>
was creepy that they could stay so well hidden, and even creepier that
<BR>
they would find it...convenient.
