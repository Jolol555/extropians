&nbsp;I used to work (again a long time ago) in union shops.  No thank you.

Samantha, I beg to differ on this one. Decades ago Unions were strong and 
<BR>
were in a position (for good and bad) to exploit the stupidities of 
<BR>
management. Since the 1970's there certainly has been a fall-off in Unions in 
<BR>
the USA. Some of this is structural as Americans priced themselves out of the 
<BR>
global labor market, in some cases , producing goods like cars and 
<BR>
electronics that the Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese would beat on both price 
<BR>
and quality! Let us not forget the Labor lawyers hired bu corporations to 
<BR>
beat the Unions, and get legislators to enact anti-Union laws. Now the 
<BR>
lawyers have turned around and have enticed workers to sue on a conditional 
<BR>
basis, in many cases splitting the fee 50/50  when the achive a win. 
<BR>
Corporation management is afraid of lawyers. For they have produced a legal 
<BR>
system that in a darwinian sense, has come back to bite them on their asses.
