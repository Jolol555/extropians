<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;That schizophrenia strikes overwhelmingly during a relatively short window in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;late teens/early twenties is interesting.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right. In the U.S., three-quarters of those who get schizophrenia do
<BR>
so between the ages of 17 and 25. Having an initial onset before age
<BR>
14, or after age 30 is unusual.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Is there a temporally programmed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brain change which goes to excess in such people?  Possibly the onset
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;period for schizophrenia might provides clues on how and why the brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changes function during life.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think the reasons are known yet. When the reasons are known,
<BR>
then that would also be clues for the age onset of other brain
<BR>
diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's.
<BR>
<P>There are also gender differences between men and women who get
<BR>
schizophrenia. For men, the age of onset is earlier (2 to 3 years
<BR>
earlier), and in men, the disease is usually more serious than for
<BR>
women. The reasons for the gender differences are unknown too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;His years from age ~60 show his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;illness in a dramatic remission and  his colleagues call him &quot;recovered&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;He is perhaps, one of the rare schizophrenic cases that goes into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;remission.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not that rare, actually; schizophrenia often abates with age.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's right. I had forgotten about that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;One theory is that schizophrenia results from hyperactivity in certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dopamine systems. The dopamine systems deteriorate with age, and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some of these patients become more normal again.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seems reasonable. A portion of the limbic system is suspected of
<BR>
being involved in schizophrenia, and I read that there is an
<BR>
excessive number of dopamine receptors found in the limbic system
<BR>
and basal ganglia in brains from patients with schizophrenia
<BR>
compared with control brains (and this finding factored out the
<BR>
antipsychotic medications the patients had been taking)
<BR>
<P>A fellow doing a lot of research with brains in order to learn of
<BR>
the causes of schizophrenia is E.Fuller Torrey. He has written a
<BR>
book: _Surviving Schizophrenia: A Family Manual_, that is the best
<BR>
book I've yet seen on the topic.
<BR>
<P>Excerpts from _Surviving Schizophrenia_ book can be found here:

<BR>
<P>Torrey is a really interesting schizophrenia researcher, so I'll
<BR>
spend a moment talking about him.
<BR>
<P>He studied medicine early in his career, but his sister's strange
<BR>
behavior (who was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenic) shifted his
<BR>
studies into the psychiatric field. The theories for schizophrenia
<BR>
at that time made no sense to him. He fought against his psychiatric
<BR>
profession, quit the American Psychiatric Association and never
<BR>
rejoined. As an adminstrator at the National Institute of Mental
<BR>
Health in the 1970's, he criticized his peers for flocking into
<BR>
lucrative private practices to serve the &quot;worried well, &quot; proposing
<BR>
that psychiatrists either spend two years working in underserved
<BR>
areas or repay the money that the Government had invested in their
<BR>
training. The advance of MRIs and a fresh generation of
<BR>
neuroscientists in the 1980s supported his ideas that schizophrenia
<BR>
was a brain disease, and he became an vocal advocate of the National
<BR>
Alliance for the Mentally Ill. He first published _Surviving
<BR>
Schizophrenia_ in 1983, and the latest (third) edition was published
<BR>
in 1995. He specializes now in schizophrenia both as a
<BR>
clinical and as a research psychiatrist in Washington, D.C.
<BR>
<P>He's had a varied career. He did his training in psychiatry at
<BR>
Stanford University, where he also took a master's degree in
<BR>
anthropology. He practiced general medicine and psychiatry; he
<BR>
served as a physician with the Peace Corps in Ethiopia, spent a year
<BR>
in a neighborhood clinic in the South Bronx, New York, and in Alaska
<BR>
in the Indian Health Service. Included in his work in psychiatry, he
<BR>
had four years as a Special Assistant to the Director of the
<BR>
National Institute of Mental Health, affiliation with St.
<BR>
Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C., and field research in
<BR>
schizophrenia in Papua New Guinea, and in Ireland. He is the author
<BR>
of nine books, over 100 lay and professional papers, and serves as
<BR>
contributing editor to Psychology Today.
<BR>
<P>In 1989, a weathy couple (the Stanleys) in Connecticut who have a
<BR>
schizophrenic family member, and were impressed by his book
<BR>
_Surviving Schizophrenia_, started donating money yearly to mental
<BR>
illness research and to aid Torrey in his efforts. In the nice web
<BR>
article that I read about Torrey,
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.schizophrenia.com/newsletter/398/398torrey.htm">http://www.schizophrenia.com/newsletter/398/398torrey.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>I read that the Stanleys gave out $20 million on that year (1998).
<BR>
Torrey estimates that that couple will spend more on manic
<BR>
depression research than the U.S. Federal Government and about a
<BR>
fifth of what the Government spends on schizophrenia research.
<BR>
<P>Torrey's most ambitious project though, now is a brain bank.
<BR>
<P>I like this quote by Torrey:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The disease in in the brain! We need brains!&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the above URL:
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We won't be getting any brains in the mail today, &quot; the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nation's best-known schizophrenia researcher says as he
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hurries to a meeting at his Washington laboratory. &quot;They
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't mail them over the weekend. We'll probably get some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fresh brains Fed Exed tomorrow. &quot; Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;psychiatrist, has had many grand passions during his
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three-decade crusade to cure schizophrenia, but none greater
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than his new human brain bank. For years, a major obstacle
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for scientists researching the neurological roots of serious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mental illnesses -- schizophrenia, manic depression,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depression -- has been the lack of first-rate human brains
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to study. &quot;The only schizophrenic brains available have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very old and not in very good shape, &quot; Torrey says. They
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came from state hospitals and nursing homes, from patients
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so elderly that by the time they died the brain had
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atrophied. &quot;We wanted to be in position to get better
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brains, brains of people younger and not dead long. &quot; Brains
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that would be full of unaltered proteins and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neurotransmitters, viruses and cytokines that might hold the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answers to schizophrenia's cause.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain bank is central to his grand plan. In 1994, he
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;began contacting medical examiners' offices and has since
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;built a national network that collects brains of mentally
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ill people who died in their 20's, 30's and 40's, from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suicide and heart failure, in car crashes and fires. Torrey
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has employed a half-dozen pathologists around the country,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paying them as much as $100,000 a year, to work full-time
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunting brains. Within 48 hours of death, the brain is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frozen at minus-70 degrees and shipped to Torrey. &quot;We're up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to 226 brains, &quot; Torrey says. &quot;We have 44 freezers here just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full of brain. &quot; While Torrey uses some tissue samples
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, most are distributed free to researchers worldwide.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scientists historically have not shared their sources, &quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says Dr. Stanley J. Watson, a University of Michigan
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professor who leased a truck in December to pick up 20,000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain sections from Torrey's lab. &quot;His attitude has been,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the more horsepower, the faster we can all move ahead. &quot;
<BR>
<P><P>Another interesting article on E. Fuller Torrey's research:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.psychlaws.org/General%20Resources/Article5.htm">http://www.psychlaws.org/General%20Resources/Article5.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Torrey is currently working now on a viral theory to explain
<BR>
schizophrenia.
<BR>
<P>There is a general consensus that genetics plays some role in the
<BR>
disease (if one has a parent who is schizophrenic, then the
<BR>
probability of getting the disease is ~10%, if one's grandparent is
<BR>
schizophrenic, the odds are ~4%, if both parents are schizophrenic,
<BR>
the statistics show about 45% probability, and the general
<BR>
population has about a 1% probability of getting the disease), and
<BR>
genetic theories of schizophrenia fit comfortably with the facts
<BR>
known about the disease. The major criticism of genetic theories is
<BR>
that schizophrenics themselves have a very low rate of
<BR>
reporoduction, and one would think that schizophrenia should have
<BR>
died out or at least become less prevalent, if it is transmitted
<BR>
from affected individuals to their offspring.
<BR>
<P>Viral theories also fit the facts known about schizophrenia. They
<BR>
can explain the minor physical anomalies, the microspic and CT-scan
<BR>
changes in the brains, the seasonality of births, and the involvment
<BR>
of the limbic system since several viruses have an affinity for that
<BR>
part of the brain. The fact that schizophrenia runs in families can
<BR>
be explained either by a gentic predisposition to the virus, by
<BR>
transmission of a virus on the gene itself, or by transmission of
<BR>
the virus acros the placenta from the mother (or the father, via the
<BR>
semen) during pregnancy. Some viruses have also been shown to cause
<BR>
changes in neurotransmitters, such as dopamine in the brain.
<BR>
<P>But there are other plausible causes of schizophrenia as well
<BR>
(immunological theories, developmental theories, stress theories,
<BR>
nutritional theories, biochemical theories), and Torrey's book
<BR>
describes these in some detail.
