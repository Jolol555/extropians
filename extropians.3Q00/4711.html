<P>
Emlyn asks about telecommuting:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, now you've piqued my interest. This is the really interesting face of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telecommuting; where you live a long way away. How do you find it? Got any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting observations on the differences between it and normal office
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work? What are the pros and cons as you see them? I'm particularly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in less obvious problems that come up, and how you deal with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Finding such work seems to require being someone the company really wants,
<BR>
but refusing to move.  In my case I had been involved with the creation
<BR>
of the software the company was based on.  They had made me an offer
<BR>
six months earlier conditional on my moving, but I turned them down.
<BR>
Finally they came back and said okay, you can stay in Santa Barbara,
<BR>
we still want you.
<BR>
<P>Other telecommuters worked for an East Coast company which had a
<BR>
technology we wanted; we bought the company but had to agree that the
<BR>
workers could live where they wanted.  A New Jersey company tried to
<BR>
hire me away a couple of years ago; they were a startup and wanted to
<BR>
get into the same field, so I could have been a big help, and they were
<BR>
willing to let me work remotely.
<BR>
<P>In each case, then, you have to have something the company wants and
<BR>
can't easily get otherwise, and then you have to stand your ground.
<BR>
<P>There are obvious advantages to being able to live in a nice area and
<BR>
work from home, which I won't dwell on.  There are serious disadvantages
<BR>
as well.  For one, my career is somewhat stalled.  I can't be a manager;
<BR>
I don't have as much input into product ideas.   Companies rely on
<BR>
informal meetings in hallways and offices, where new concepts originate
<BR>
and ideas are bounced off people.  A consensus builds before a formal
<BR>
proposal can be made.  I'm largely cut of from this process.
<BR>
<P>It's also a lonely way to work.  This doesn't bother me much but I
<BR>
don't think most people would like it.  It helps that I have a family,
<BR>
but many days go by when I see no one but my wife and kids.  I've always
<BR>
made friends where I work, but this is not possible now.
<BR>
<P>We have weekly meetings, with about 5 remote employees teleconferenced
<BR>
into the room with an equal number of on-site employees.  The people in
<BR>
the conference room have a much easier time participating in discussions
<BR>
than those on the phone, and probably take 3/4 of the talk time.
<BR>
Talking into a dead phone, it's impossible to tell how people are
<BR>
reacting, and the regular social conventions for interruptions and such
<BR>
don't work well with the voice-activated phone electronics.
<BR>
<P>Despite these problems I find the situation to be very suitable for me.
<BR>
I do enjoy the work, and it's a field I've been interested in for years.
<BR>
I have more control over how I manage my time.  And Santa Barbara is a
<BR>
beautiful place to live, which is worth a lot.
<BR>
