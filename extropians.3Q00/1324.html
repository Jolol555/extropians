<P>
I shouldn't do this to you people, but I will.
<BR>
<P>A warning: I'm someone with an addictive personallity, quite obsessive.
<BR>
Various members of my extended family have ridiculous addiction problems; I
<BR>
confine my drug intake strictly to caffeine, to which I am a hopelessly
<BR>
addicted. Luckily, that is regarded almost as highly as professional
<BR>
association membership for coders.
<BR>
<P>My other major problem addiction, especially a problem in Uni, is arcade
<BR>
games. Before you scoff, I must admit I was spending $50 plus a week on
<BR>
them, when I was on an income of around $100 a week (ack, student life).
<BR>
There are worse addictions in the world (I've worked in a bar and watched
<BR>
Poker machine addicts go for it; misery), but I think it is real. I don't
<BR>
walk past computer game arcades now if I can help it (because I don't walk
<BR>
past them, if you catch my drift).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I own two computer game CDs now, and hardly ever put them near my
<BR>
PC; somehow I can't get them out of the CD drive once they go in.
<BR>
<P>I thought Utopia would be safe; it's a strategy game, all text based, how
<BR>
bad could it be? Hmm. I estimate that it soaks a minimum of an hour a day.
<BR>
At heavy times, it can push to four hours. That's truly detrimental. It's
<BR>
really, really addictive.
<BR>
<P>Luckily, massively multiplayer online games are also entirely new (I mean
<BR>
games with, say, 10,000 players plus), and so the experience of such a new
<BR>
gaming environment is entirely worth (or at least partially compensates) the
<BR>
investment. It really is qualitatively different from any small scale
<BR>
game.I've played play-by-mails with over 200 players in the past, but it is
<BR>
just not the same as this. You've never felt so insignificant as when you
<BR>
are competing with tens of thousands of other players! I think people should
<BR>
take the time to try things like this; it helps bring home very personally a
<BR>
modern truth, which is that the number of other people in the world is more
<BR>
than you can comprehend in any significant sense. Even 40,000 people is a
<BR>
lot of people. Too many to get a mental picture of.
<BR>
<P>You've been warned.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://games.swirve.com/utopia/">http://games.swirve.com/utopia/</A>
<BR>
<P>(if anyone is actually going to start playing, have a look soon. The new
<BR>
round is starting in the next week or two, it's the ideal time to get a
<BR>
feeling for the game. When the new round starts, you need to know what is
<BR>
going on from day 1. I can send people a list of the most important
<BR>
player-maintained strategy and support software sites out there; you cannot
<BR>
be competitive without checking these sites out)

<EM>&gt; &gt; In this game, you play a fantasy province; Orcs, elves dwarves,
</EM><BR>
halflings
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (yawn, yep same old stuff). It has a interestingly simplistic geographic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; model - there's no map, you just exist in this abstract world, with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; certain amount of acres of land, all kinds of production statistics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; settings which lead ultimately to an expansion rate of population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (particularly limited by land) and income level (production rate of
</EM><BR>
gold).
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You use those things to make an army, and you use your army to get more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; land.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gadzooks, this sounds like a cross between Middle Earth and Empire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your summary would agree with conclusions that were reached by many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the first Empire addicts (including myself) back in the mid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1970's when Peter Langston first made the game available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did anyone else on the list ever play Empire?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, is there a URL for Utopia?
