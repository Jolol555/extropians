<EM>&gt; 	this thread is fast becoming too confusing for me; let's recap. is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this thread about whether we _can_ over run the solar system, or whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we _will_?
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;What do you mean 'we', paleface?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Meaning, there are many people with different views on the matter.
<BR>
Some may want to grab all the resources they can, others may be more
<BR>
conservative.  When you have a vast space like the solar system, it may
<BR>
be difficult for the stay-at-homes to enforce their will on those out on
<BR>
the frontier.  If space-based self-replicating machines are practical,
<BR>
and someone starts chewing up the asteroids and turning them into armed
<BR>
habitats, how will people on earth stop him?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	to me at least, there is no question that given sophisticated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech, we would be _able_ to turn the solar system (the galaxy even)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into a terran breeding ground in an astonishingly short time. however, i
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought samantha's original point was that once we have such power, we may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not _want_ to waste it so profligately.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it is a mistake to analyze this problem in collective terms.
<BR>
You need to look at the diversity of goals, drives, and constraints which
<BR>
people will have.  It's hard to judge the scenarios at this point, but
<BR>
it seems plausible to me that we could end up with a race to acquire,
<BR>
develop and defend space resources.
