Let's see, the name is Eliezer Yudkowsky and you really think people didn't 
<BR>
guess you were a Jew? Oy!

<P>&lt;&lt; For a long time, I have followed a policy of not discussing religious
<BR>
&nbsp;matters online.  This is because my family is Orthodox Jewish - they
<BR>
&nbsp;believe in the literal truth of the Old Testament - and for many years
<BR>
&nbsp;it has been necessary for me to conceal from them my real beliefs. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Today I sent them an email informing them that I am not, in fact,
<BR>
&nbsp;Jewish.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;For those of you who are curious about the history of the break, I am
<BR>
&nbsp;proud to say that my religious disagreements began at the age of five. 
<BR>
&nbsp;I was spared the painful break, the sudden crisis of conscience from
<BR>
&nbsp;faith to reason, that often characterizes such transitions; when I was a
<BR>
&nbsp;child, people tried to sell me blatantly ridiculous concepts - like
<BR>
&nbsp;praying in a language you don't understand, or the idea that two
<BR>
&nbsp;contradictory opinions can both be correct - and I wouldn't buy them,
<BR>
&nbsp;although I wasn't allowed to say so.  I never trusted Authority over my
<BR>
&nbsp;own perceptions - not at age five, and not at any age.  And I'm proud of
<BR>
&nbsp;it.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I don't remember the exact age when I crossed over from believing that
<BR>
&nbsp;Judaism had accumulated flaws to believing that Judaism was outright
<BR>
&nbsp;wrong, but I do recall that at the age of fourteen I believed that
<BR>
&nbsp;Judaism was just another memetically generated religion.  But I still
<BR>
&nbsp;had to follow all the rules.  If you've been wondering why it's only in
<BR>
&nbsp;the past month that you've seen any posts from me between Friday night
<BR>
&nbsp;and Saturday night, it's because Jews aren't allowed to use computers on
<BR>
&nbsp;the Sabbath.  So it's been a very long nightmare indeed that has just
<BR>
&nbsp;ended.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I would like to thank the six people who knew, and kept, my secret:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Atkins
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabine Stoeckel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Voss
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise Gold
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha Vita-More
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max More
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;It helped a lot to be able to talk to someone, even for just a few
<BR>
&nbsp;hours.  (Everyone I knew in Chicago was also Jewish.) &gt;&gt;
