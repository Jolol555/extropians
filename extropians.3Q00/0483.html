<P><EM>&gt; Kind of reminds me of a truck I saw in the US with two stickers on it. The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  first one said &quot;member of the NRA&quot;, the second said &quot;support Clinton/ 
</EM><BR>
Gore&quot;. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Unfortunately it could also be an illustration of the same philosophical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  errors that some transhumans commit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>I like that guy!! That's NOT neccesarily  an error, it simply is 
<BR>
contradictory. He absolutely correct in his own convictions. Perhaps he is 
<BR>
avidly against religion in the school -  but  likes the economy since the 
<BR>
democrats are in power -  and maybe he even supports socialized medicine -  
<BR>
while still being a staunch believer in right to bear arms! Hey, maybe he's 
<BR>
my uncle... an American Indian, he wants to keep his land rights AND his 
<BR>
guns! 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The capacity to tolerate complexity and welcome contradiction, not 
<BR>
the need for simplicity and certainty, is the attribute of an explorer&quot;

<P>Personally, I applaud people who have their OWN opinions on individual issues.
<BR>
<P>IT is perfectly OK to blatantly disagree with your party's platforms on some 
<BR>
issues. I think it more productive, since the party will listen more to it's 
<BR>
own -- than to a bunch of non-thinking party liners who are destructive.
<BR>
<P>Most of the Bush supporters also think prayer in the schools should be 
<BR>
restored too, Will you accuse someone of the same crap if they had a Bush 
<BR>
sticker and an atheist one? 
<BR>
Surely you must.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>I hate when people follow a party lines on every single issue (whatever party 
<BR>
it is) especially those claiming to espouse individualism.  Blechhhhhhhh
<BR>

<BR>
Sheldrake.
