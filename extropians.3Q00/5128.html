<EM>&gt;  &gt;The will-work-for-fooders stand out there on the corner,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;with all limbs in apparent working condition, while Burger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;King is *crying out* for someone willing to just push a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;mop and wipe tables.  And they will hire *anyone* no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;questions asked, dog kickers, mass murderers, whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;They hire the mentally retarded, but oddly enough, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;arent enough of them either.  And the fast food gets steadily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;slower, because there arent enough people working the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;kitchen.  Meanwhile the floors and tables get ever dirtier.
</EM><BR>
<P>I take it you have never worked at a Burger-King.  I have (a long, LONG
<BR>
time ago when I was &lt; 20).  They want people they can make part of their
<BR>
process. People they can control.  Fast food robots.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a very real problem at all levels of the economy.  The solution at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the top is to keep raising the wages, with management - no matter how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incompetent - getting astronomical money with noone noticing that they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usually the least competent people in the company.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I take it you are not a manager. :-)  It is a really gross
<BR>
generalization to claim all managers are incompetent.  It is also an
<BR>
over-generalization to claim they are all highly paid much less getting
<BR>
astronomical money.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The next teir down - the engineers, researchers, etc. - who actually do most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the work and actually make most of the decisions that management takes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; credit for and gets paid for, have gotten very slight monetary increases,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and huge increases in work load.  The next level - the blue collar and white
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collar grunts who mostly just &quot;do a job&quot; - have gotten less than nothing in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay increases in real buying terms for over a decade now, even as their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; productivity has skyrocketed, and the hours have gone up as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I take it you probably are in this tier. :-)  Again, a lot of
<BR>
over-generalizations.  Some of us at this tier make as much or more than
<BR>
our nominal managers.  In software, their is such a demand that
<BR>
experienced reasonably good people are having money thrown at them. 
<BR>
Some studies say that the productivity of the average white collar
<BR>
worker has not gone up despite automation.  I don't agree that the hours
<BR>
have gone up across the board.  At least not without more information.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Meanwhile, the engineers, etc., are getting damned tired of 80 hour work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weeks without corresponding pay, so they are burning out and quiting in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large numbers.  And the grunts are starting to listen to the union
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unions are more exploitive than most management from what I've seen when
<BR>
I used to work (again a long time ago) in union shops.  No thank you.
