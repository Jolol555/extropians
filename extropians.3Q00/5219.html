<EM>&gt;       &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &gt;&gt;Please explain how a gamma ray photon could blow a radio photon away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; Gamma ray photon hits radio photon, cancels out energy of said photon, or merly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; knocks it down to a lower frequency (or up to a higher frequency). If the signal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; is frequency modulated, your signal loses resolution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No. Gamma ray and radio photons are both bosons, they have integer spin so they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not bound by The Pauli Exclusion Principle. Two photons can be in the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantum state but no two particles with half integer spin, like electrons, can be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a good thing that things don't work as you suggest,  if photons had half integer spins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and thus could not be in the same place at the same time then you couldn't see the moon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or the stars or even the man sitting next to you. Photons from an object you wanted to look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at would collide and be hopelessly scrambled by photons moving at right angles to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You'd be blind as a bat.
</EM><BR>
<P>Really? Then please oh please ESPLAIN to me  how it is that things like
<BR>
interference patterns, scalar waves, signal interference, EMI and AMC work
<BR>
unless you have one photon interfering with another....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well ok, I have heard of some theoretical work that if the Gamma rays were intense enough,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I mean intense, the sort of thing you only find near a black hole or Gamma ray burster, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there might be a little scattering, but if you're that near a Gamma ray burster the fact that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communication network is not working at optimal performance will be the least of your worries.
</EM><BR>
<P>What does the gamma flux gradient need to be to do this? Can it occur simply as
<BR>
a matter of the wave front of a GRB wiping out signals?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; Ever heard of radar jamming, john?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>I should hope so. Now, think about what natural phenomena act in ways similar to
<BR>
radar jamming....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; You just are not making your neutradio from the right materials, obviously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I give you a magic material that stops neutrinos for your neutradio then you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to give me a magic material that can stop neutrinos before they ever get to you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why all this neutrino business, radio works just fine, if it's nor broken don't fix it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Partly because we know it annoys you John. Also, because we know that most
<BR>
natural processes we are aware of are NOT capable of interfering with neutrino
<BR>
emissions in any significant way, so theoretically, a neutrino signal should be
<BR>
receivable with the right equipment across the universe. Of course, you also
<BR>
have to deal with the neutrino signal strength being higher than the background
<BR>
noise and stronger than any nearby sources. Moreover, any planetary neutrino
<BR>
source is likely to be far less than the neutrino source of the planet's star,
<BR>
so you are still dealing with problems of signal strength. The only advantage is
<BR>
that neutrinos tend not to futz with one another, anywhere near as much as
<BR>
photons would.
