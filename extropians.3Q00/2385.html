Fra: Zero Powers
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Its no secret in the music industry that over 75% of the cost of a CD goes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into manufacturing, packaging, distribution and record company profit.
</EM><BR>
Only 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;about 1/5 of the price pays for actual production of the recording and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;payment to the artist.  It is *only* that 1/5 that I have any desire to
</EM><BR>
pay.
<BR>
<P>The cost of a CD consists of several layers:
<BR>
<P>Demo
<BR>
Recording
<BR>
Graphic-artwork
<BR>
Music video
<BR>
CD-Production
<BR>
Advertising campaign
<BR>
Distribution (transport/stores)
<BR>
sales tax
<BR>
<P>A CD-Production costs about $1 including packaging and printing of the
<BR>
booklet.
<BR>
So yes you can save that.
<BR>
<P>You can also save most of the distribution costs. Especially as bandwith
<BR>
gets cheaper.
<BR>
<P>But that still leaves:
<BR>
<P>Demo
<BR>
Recording
<BR>
Graphic-artwork
<BR>
Music video
<BR>
Advertising campaign
<BR>
sales tax
<BR>
<P>The more bands that makes and receives CD's the more need there will be for
<BR>
marketing. This is happening allready now where it is practically impossible
<BR>
to break a new band without TV advertising.
<BR>
<P>So probably free distribution will not make it cheaper to sell music as
<BR>
there will be a bigger need for marketing. This might be leveled somewhat by
<BR>
the fact that more people probably will buy music if it is readily available
<BR>
on-line.
<BR>
<P>I don't know about you but I would like to see more and better music video's
<BR>
and I would like even better and more progressive music. Furthermore I will
<BR>
like to know about music that I like in the Fringe of the techno scene. 
<BR>
<P>A million artist doing their own website for promoting music will not do
<BR>
that. I have no time to search all that information. I don't even have time
<BR>
to do it on mp3.com as they take in everything. All I have ever heard (well
<BR>
almost all) on mp3.com is demo quality at best. An artist is not the best
<BR>
judge of his own work. Thus I want a filtering infrastructure that can give
<BR>
ME the high quality music that I like.
<BR>
<P>This is what a recording company should do (You can also call them editors,
<BR>
critics etc. Same difference.). So I don't think they will go away. I don't
<BR>
want them to go away.
<BR>
<P>Regards Max M Rasmussen (Denmark)
