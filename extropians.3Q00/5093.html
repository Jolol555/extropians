Not to get holy-roller on anyone here, but I agree with Samatha's conjecture 
<BR>
that if there is no God, then there is certainly room for one in a Universe 
<BR>
that includes suffering. What Samantha gets when she &quot;recieves a lift&quot; from 
<BR>
reading certain religious tracts is one of the religious experiences 
<BR>
described by 19th century psychologist Willam James.  Having a God module is 
<BR>
good if it connects one up with a sense of a better ethical system. If it 
<BR>
leads only to the Inquisition torture chamber, then it's a bad bet.  So I am 
<BR>
talking 'outcomes' here. 
<BR>
<P>Ultimately, it may turn out that some advanced primate species (humans) once 
<BR>
had a God module as part of their brain, and it helped them develop computers 
<BR>
that colonized the cosmos, which in the end leads to an ultimate Mind (God) 
<BR>
which fixed things that needed fixing (since it has ultimate computing power) 
<BR>
and help resurrect people such as Samantha! This is more inspired from a 
<BR>
reading of Julian Barbour (The End of Time)  as well as Tipler and Barrow's 
<BR>
Final Anthropic Principle. Talk amongst yourselves, i'm getting ver-klempt! 
<BR>
(sob!)

<P>&lt;&lt; But when the God module kicks in things happen similar to stuff in  the
<BR>
&nbsp;mystical literature.  I don't levitate or anything really wild like that
<BR>
&nbsp;but it feels as if my being is lifted up and sometimes turned inside out
<BR>
&nbsp;and that I am within or in communion with or at least sense deeply this
<BR>
&nbsp;much larger Presence, Power, whatever you want to call it. The &quot;me&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;disappears mostly or melts into whatever this is or gets recast
<BR>
&nbsp;somehow.   The emotions soar into the heavens.  It goes beyond anything
<BR>
&nbsp;I can put into words pretty rapidly. Often it will include what seems
<BR>
&nbsp;like a tremendous amount of information  and intensionality and directed
<BR>
&nbsp;energy sweeping through me.  I have guesses (ranging from faulty mental
<BR>
&nbsp;wiring to too much religous upbringing to substances sampled in my
<BR>
&nbsp;youth  to Vingean powers looking for agents to ???) but no real
<BR>
&nbsp;explanation for it.  It just is - now and then.  Thankfully rare enough
<BR>
&nbsp;it doesn't totally sweep me away.  It came close when I used to meditate
<BR>
&nbsp;more.  Whatever it is meditation intensified it quite a bit.  So I
<BR>
&nbsp;stopped doing that because shadows of whatever this is became too strong
<BR>
&nbsp;to allow me to concentrate on my work easily.
