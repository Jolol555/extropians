<EM>&gt; I challenge anyone on this list to demonstrate how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free-markets can exist without a feudalist tyranny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resulting.  Demonstrate how such a system  will not favor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rich over poor when it comes to basic civil rights and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justice.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you look at history over the past 150 years in the United States,
<BR>
I think we see the opposite.  Society has moved to restrict the power of
<BR>
big business, rather than to enhance it.  We have gone from the days of
<BR>
trusts, monopolies, robber barons, child labor, union busting, 60 hour
<BR>
work weeks, and similar so-called excesses of 19th century capitalism to
<BR>
a world in which there are many legal restrictions on the activities of
<BR>
businessmen.  These changes were bitterly opposed by business interests.
<BR>
<P>Now, I don't think we can accept all of the mythology that has grown
<BR>
around this history as literally true.  But it does seem to me that
<BR>
contrary to your prediction, the interactions of business and society
<BR>
can and do lead to reductions in the power of business, rather than
<BR>
the opposite.
<BR>
<P>And the reason should be clear; it is because of the effect I
<BR>
described earlier, that there are other sources of power in society.
<BR>
Business interests are countered by political groups, by labor unions,
<BR>
by consumer groups.  All of these wield power.  Business itself is often
<BR>
divided as one group seeks leverage over another.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you can't, then you should stop complaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when people call you fascists or at best platocracists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure companies are there to meet the demands of the consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and stockholders, but that just goes to show you that he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the most money - rich consumer, rich stockholder makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the rules.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your critique seems to have two relatively distinct parts.  One talks
<BR>
about how big business can influence government to increase its power.
<BR>
This does happen in some circumstances, raising the question of whether
<BR>
a government could be constructed without such &quot;bugs&quot;.  That's a big
<BR>
issue and I won't try to get into it here.
<BR>
<P>However the other part you have complained about would apply even
<BR>
if there were a libertarian government that did not interfere in any
<BR>
voluntary activities.  You seem offended that business will direct its
<BR>
efforts in such a way as to maximize its profits, rather than working
<BR>
altrustically to help &quot;little people&quot;.
<BR>
<P>You talk here about businesses serving rich consumers.  Earlier you
<BR>
complained about businesses firing people.
<BR>
<P>This is a much weaker criticism.  Although it is true that some businesses
<BR>
go after the rich, the market is highly diverse and there are plenty of
<BR>
companies which sell to the little guy.  After all, you're a little guy
<BR>
and yet you buy from companies every day, don't you?  You do business with
<BR>
thousands of different companies.  Why do they bother to sell to you?
<BR>
Why do they work so hard to come up with products that you will like?
<BR>
They're not interested in selling only to the rich.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Who is there to protect the little guy?  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you don't give a damn about the little guy, then I rest my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you're talking about voluntary transactions in the marketplace,
<BR>
protection not an issue in most cases.  If you're talking about the
<BR>
government-controlled legal system, then I agree that protection is
<BR>
desirable, but unfortunately no one has yet come up with a government
<BR>
which has managed to stay immune to the corrupting influence of power.
<BR>
<P>Certainly getting rid of big business won't solve that problem, of the
<BR>
Soviet Union (which was founded on rhetoric similar to yours) would have
<BR>
been a utopia.
