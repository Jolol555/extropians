Eliezer S. Yudkowsky writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But attracting people to the most important job in the entire world?  How much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leadership talent do you need for *that*?
</EM><BR>
<P>You'd need the most talented leadership in the entire world, because the entire
<BR>
world is more interested in Olympic games and making money than it is interested
<BR>
in the most important job. The most important job appeals only to the most
<BR>
intelligent and conscientious brains.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My purpose, above all else, is to design the Seed.  Other people can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; persuade.  I have to complete the design.  If being charismatic requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patterns of thought that interfere with my ability to complete the design, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if it starts taking up too much time, then forget charismatic.  I'll stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the basement and someone else will be charismatic instead.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you actually design the Seed, you won't need charisma. The AI Seed will
<BR>
decide whether (and what kind of) charisma is needed. As John R. Koza, et al.,
<BR>
pointed out in _Genetic progamming and Evolvable Machines_, human-competitive
<BR>
genetic programming has produced results which have been patented (p. 124).
<BR>
Automatic creation has no need for charisma.
