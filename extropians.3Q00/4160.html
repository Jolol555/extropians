ankara has insightfully inserted:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;A significant minority of those who took part in the survey - more than one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in five - felt that reproductive cloning could also be justified on medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;grounds, if for instance it was the only way for a couple to have a child of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would the couple really have their own child? ...only one of the couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would reproduce, that is, have their own clone. Why bother with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'coupledoom' at all?
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent questions, ankara. Perhaps the surveyed respondents felt that by the
<BR>
time cloning becomes available to couples, genetic engineering can produce an
<BR>
improved clone, i.e., one with just a touch of modification to amplify the
<BR>
immune system, raise IQ, preclude defects, etc. Moreover, some DNA from the
<BR>
uncloned parent could be combined with the cloned parent to birth a composite.
<BR>
Why couple? Statistical evidence shows that children with two parents fare
<BR>
better than those with only one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; snip....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;He said: &quot;While there is likely to be a striking physical resemblance, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;clone would differ from the original in most of the higher mental attributes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that define an individual.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm confused.... Is he referring to environmental influence on talent or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personality? Or is he saying that indentical DNA may unfold in different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patterns?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I think he's saying that, just as with identical twins (which are actually
<BR>
clones of each other), discrete and independent personalities would develop
<BR>
based on the fact that their respective brains would have their own individual
<BR>
cognitive experience. Although their bodies would be identical, their
<BR>
environments would not be. (In the case of clones, their environments could be
<BR>
very different indeed.)
<BR>
Identical DNA would *not* unfold in different patterns. Identical twins even
<BR>
have identical moles and freckles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...wonder if human cloning will become first choice for off-spring rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than mixing DNA. One, You'll know exactly what your getting: another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chance. Second, Your need to sire offspring/reproduce will be satisfied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely. Third, You'll have a perfectly matched organ donor.
</EM><BR>
<P>In a few decades, first choice for off-spring may well coincide with Moravec's
<BR>
_Mind Children_ rather than with un-enhanced breeding. I don't think any of this
<BR>
equals &quot;another chance&quot; because the world of the clone will be so different from
<BR>
the parent's that whatever chance pertained to the parent will not apply to the
<BR>
clone. In the future, if you truly love your children, you will probably opt not
<BR>
to have any. The instinct to reproduce is not satisfied by the existence of
<BR>
offspring, but rather by changes in hormonal composition and pheromone
<BR>
interaction in parents.
<BR>
Instead of using the clone for organ transplants, go ahead and use it for a
<BR>
whole body transplant, because you'll need to direct your effort and energies
<BR>
toward bringing about the technological singularity rather than on
<BR>
overpopulating the world. Otherwise, it won't be a fit world to live in.
