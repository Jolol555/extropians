<P><P>Yes and no.  The seeker uses a wicked cool cocktail of algorithms to
<BR>
discriminate and home in on RVs; of the half dozen or so different
<BR>
algorithms used in parallel, a couple are classified and give extended
<BR>
discrimination capabilities outside those algorithms in the public domain.
<BR>
<P>But a supercomputer it is not.  As I recall, the slick product your shop
<BR>
puts out runs primarily on a MIPS 3k embedded core with a boring mid-range
<BR>
DSP for number crunching.  Which makes sense because these types of
<BR>
algorithms operating in such a limited window don't require that much
<BR>
crunch to work.
<BR>
<P>The real high-tech features that seperate it from what the bad guys can
<BR>
do are the extended discrimination capabilities, and the bleeding edge
<BR>
materials science that was required to make a homing device that could
<BR>
withstand the extreme environment.  The window that the sensor looks
<BR>
through alone is more sophisticated than the materials manufacturing
<BR>
capabilities of most countries (possibly all countries, save the US, but I
<BR>
am not sure what the current materials capabilities of other countries
<BR>
currently are).
