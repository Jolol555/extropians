<P>
In a sidestep move that failed to leave the Pope floundering helplessly,
<BR>
Aussie researchers have just announced a new advance in the casuistic war
<BR>
over the sanctity of blastocyts and other small but perfectly formed
<BR>
identical sacred lifeforms.
<BR>
<P>I'll be interviewed alongside Dr Trounson tonight on a radio show, so I
<BR>
hope I can ferret out some more details on how fast cloned replacement
<BR>
organs can be forced to grow - faster than 16 years to maturity, one would
<BR>
hope.

MEDIA RELEASE
<BR>
<P>14 August 2000
<BR>
<P>THERAPEUTIC CLONING BREAKTHROUGH
<BR>
<P>Embryonic stem cell experts at the Monash Institute of Reproduction and
<BR>
Development have taken another important step in the quest to develop
<BR>
therapeutic cloning techniques for the treatment of diseases like
<BR>
Alzheimers, Parkinsons and diabetes.
<BR>
<P>Therapeutic cloning involves culturing stem cells in the laboratory that
<BR>
could become replacement nerves and organs to overcome a range of
<BR>
devastating illnesses.  
<BR>
<P>Earlier this year the team at Monash Institute announced that they were the
<BR>
first in the world to grow nerve cells in the laboratory.
<BR>
<P>The next stage in the development of this therapy is to grow these cells
<BR>
using a patient's own DNA, so that when introduced to the body, the immune
<BR>
system will not reject them.
<BR>
<P>In another world first the Monash team has proven this theory using a mouse
<BR>
model.  The scientists have established cloned mouse stem cell lines which
<BR>
have the potential to grow into any type of mouse cell.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is an important development and proof of principle of therapeutic
<BR>
cloning theory,&quot; said Professor Alan Trounson, Deputy Director of the
<BR>
Monash Institute of Reproduction and Development.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Much important research is still needed before we can take this treatment
<BR>
to the public however this model is an important step that brings together
<BR>
the specialised skills of the team at Monash Institute,&quot; said Professor
<BR>
Trounson.
<BR>
<P>Monash PhD student, Ms Megan Munsie, has removed the genetic material or
<BR>
DNA from an unfertilised mouse egg.  She has replaced it with the nucleus
<BR>
or DNA of another developed cell from a &quot;target mouse&quot;.  This insertion of
<BR>
a nucleus from a developed or differentiated cell &quot;fertilizes&quot; the egg by
<BR>
introducing two complete sets of chromosomes.  
<BR>
<P>&quot;An embryo is grown for several days to blastocyst stage,&quot; explains Ms
<BR>
Munsie. &quot;Stem cells are then removed from the embryo and cultured in the
<BR>
laboratory.&quot;   
<BR>
<P>&quot;These stem cells have the same genetic make up as the original target
<BR>
mouse and therefore if we were to program the cells to become a specific
<BR>
body type, theoretically they could be introduced to the target mouse to
<BR>
treat illnesses,&quot; said Ms Munsie.
<BR>
<P>This study is being published in the August edition of Current Biology.
<BR>
<P>The commercial partner for this research is Australian biotechnology
<BR>
company, Stem Cell Sciences.
