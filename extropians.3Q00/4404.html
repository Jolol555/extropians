<EM>&gt; I don't know whether I'd go so far as to call myself an NLPer, but I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found the concepts to be some of the most useful of all the intangible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tools I possess.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, personally and professionally, I've found NLP to be one of the most
<BR>
personally-extropianistic, ie, it's taken me better and beyond who I was
<BR>
prior to discovering it! 
<BR>
<P>I can actually attribute 2 job promotions to my NLP skills! In addition,
<BR>
my love life is a masterpeace! And of the 10 or so job interviews I've
<BR>
done in the past year, I've been offered all but 2 jobs!
<BR>
<P><P><P>In an earlier post you seemed to be associating Richard
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Bandler's work with things spiritual.  Perhaps he's gone down other paths
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since I studied NLP several years ago, but I would have classified his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work as scientific rather than spiritual (as your earlier post implied).
</EM><BR>
<P>In my opinion Richard has gone into some more spiritual domains,
<BR>
particularly since he started having Robert Anton Wilson co-teach at most
<BR>
of his seminars! However, he certainly is very scientific, having a
<BR>
background in Chemistry, Math, and Physics!
