&nbsp;_Permaculture:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; A Practical Guide for a Sustainable Future_ by Bill Mollison.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This point indicates to me how the lives of the people on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; globe could be so much better if greed, incompetance, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mistrust did not get in the way of making sure the basic needs of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people were met.  This book sounds to be a potential bible for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those in the third-world, and not just for Americans trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; escape the &quot;rat race.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The techniques described in the book have been extensively used in
<BR>
third-world countries by people who were not getting enough to eat using
<BR>
other methods of food production and acquisition.  The book is not so much a
<BR>
how-to-do-it manual for specific techniques as a meta-design manual that
<BR>
describes how to go about turning a small piece of land into an efficient
<BR>
life-support system.  One of Bill's &quot;rules&quot; (which has also long been one of
<BR>
my own) is that everything should have at least 2 different purposes. For
<BR>
example, one of the bedrooms of my house (the house consists of several
<BR>
small structures joined by covered walkways or breezeways rather than one
<BR>
large one, since we have a greater problem staying cool in the summer than
<BR>
keeping warm in winter--also it makes it look more like a series of storage
<BR>
sheds, which is very good for purposes of ad valorem tax assessment) has a
<BR>
window which faces west.  I put the window there, because I love the look of
<BR>
the late afternoon sun shining on a particular painting that I own; but it
<BR>
presents a problem in the summer, because afternoon is the hottest part of
<BR>
the day, and we don't want the sun shinging in then.  So I built a
<BR>
juniper-wood framework on which to grow deciduous vines which begin growing
<BR>
in spring.  By the time hot weather arrives, the vines have made a thick
<BR>
cover that shades the window.  A 2nd use of the framework is to support
<BR>
vines which produce grapes (I made some grape jelly today, BTW).  A 3rd use
<BR>
is for visual beauty: one of the vines climbing on the framework is coral
<BR>
vine which makes the most beautiful clusters of shell-pink flowers.  A 4th
<BR>
use is for olfactory beauty: 2 of the vines are star jasmine and honeysuckle
<BR>
(these are actually evergreen rather than deciduous, so I have to trim them
<BR>
back in winter). Here I think I part company with Bill Mollison, because
<BR>
I've never heard him talk about growing flowers except in a rather
<BR>
derogatory way.  In my opionion, flowers are medicine for the spirit
<BR>
(extropians don't believe in spirit? well then, how about calling them
<BR>
anti-depressants) (and, in some cases, potent medicine for the body as
<BR>
well).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Bonnie, I simply love reading the posts where you describe your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifestyle!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Why thank you, John!  I felt a bit self-indugent writing so much about my
<BR>
own little life.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;I admire what you have done so much!  The way you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have gone from being employed as a high-powered lawyer, to living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off the land to a great extent, in a home you built yourself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just amazing.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Well, between you &amp; me, I wasn't all that high-powered.  I was pretty laid
<BR>
back.  But I WAS good at getting IRS to leave my clients in peace.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Have you ever been written about in your local
<BR>
<EM>&gt; newspaper?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, but my dog Mousey got written up twice in the University of Texas paper,
<BR>
once when a photographer got a cute shot of him begging for food from the
<BR>
customers of an outdoor restaurant, and another time when I took him to an
<BR>
art show opening and he peed on one of the paintings.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
