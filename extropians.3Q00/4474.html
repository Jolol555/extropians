<P>Ross Jefferies actually encourages his customers to buy his entire &quot;package deal&quot; which runs at around a cool thousand...  In an article I read about him he talks about teaching his &quot;disciples&quot; how to have &quot;sexual jedi&quot; powers! lol
<BR>
<P>I used to actually think I would have to buy something like this to ever have a girlfriend...  But, my friends were right that it is a matter of just letting the woman clearly know that you are interested in more then simply being a &quot;friend.&quot;  Also, growing out of one's extremely awkward stage helps a great deal too...
