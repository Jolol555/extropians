<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Why? Arcologies are in actuality highly wasteful structures,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;demanding more resources per occupant than a more diffuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;community.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Huh? Got a URL to support this? Apartment buildings use much less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resources than individual houses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I guess the reasoning is that operationally they may be more efficient, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building them demands so much more design and labor work, as well as more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive higher performance materials that the resources used to support that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overwhelm those saved in the day to day operations. So long as building
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficiencies discount savings beyond 10 years as much as they do, arcologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will always be negative impactors.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't build an acrcology for a 10 year lifespan, however.  Consider the
<BR>
average apartment building - the lifespan is 20-40 years, on average, unless
<BR>
there is a dramatic defect.  An arcology would be an organic structure, in that
<BR>
it would constantly be undergoing small and large changes over time.
<BR>
<P>There is indeed an overhead in the form of increased planning and resource
<BR>
costs at the onset - you are basically front-loading a large chunk of your 
<BR>
expenses at the beginning. But consider the externalized costs of the standard
<BR>
diffuse settlement: transit networks, vast road structures, and environmental
<BR>
impact of so much diffuse settlement acting as a heat source pouring excess
<BR>
heat intot he air above (an effect noted over urban areas such as Atlanta
<BR>
and Houston, where ambient air temperatures have increased markedly).
<BR>
<P>There are certain types of efficiencies an arcology can add in a social context
<BR>
as well.  But as long as people continue to believe the myth of &quot;battleship&quot;
<BR>
living, there will be no truly reasonable discource on arcologies, and they
<BR>
will continue to be simply an artistic and architectural curiosity, rather 
<BR>
than being one of the msot efficient forms of habitation in difficult 
<BR>
environments (It's easier to dme a single arcology than the homes of tens of
<BR>
thousands of people nt he traditional urban/suburban configuration)
