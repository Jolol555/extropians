<P>Rex, could you cite examples where biotech is operating in a distinctly
<BR>
different way than traditional plant breeding?  (Other than perhaps
<BR>
say the problem of antibiotic genes in the plants, which were/are
<BR>
an unfortunate engineering path that should be eliminated in the future.)
<BR>
<P>For example -- are &quot;natural&quot; hybrid crops subjected to the same testing
<BR>
and environmental controls that the engineered crops undergo?
<BR>
<P>Bruce Ames has a wonderful story about a &quot;natural&quot; insect resistant
<BR>
vegetable that was developed through traditional crop breeding methods
<BR>
a few years ago.  I believe it was giving rashes to the workers who
<BR>
harvested it.  Subsequent testing found that the reason it was insect
<BR>
resistant was a mutation that significantly amplified its production
<BR>
of &quot;natural&quot; insect toxins (many of which are mutagenic or carcinogenic).
<BR>
<P>What would be better -- &quot;natural&quot; food products containing toxins that
<BR>
are known to have some mutagenic capacity or &quot;artificial&quot; food products
<BR>
containing substances harmful to &quot;pests&quot; but harmless to humans?
<BR>
<P>[Whether such substances exists is an open question currently, but
<BR>
knowledge of the respective genomes (pests &amp; humans) gives some
<BR>
hope that such substances might be eventually be discovered.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do some serious research and you'll find that many of the people against GE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bio-tech have serious concerns---they're not just anti-new.  The biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; web of life out there is rather delicately balanced.  You can't just throw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a glowing-grass monkey wrench in it and not reap unanticipated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences.
</EM><BR>
<P>The development of plants with antibiotic genes is probably undesirable.
<BR>
As is the use of antibiotics in livestock production and fish farming.
<BR>
So to be rational about it anti-Gene-Engineering activists should be
<BR>
as active against current farming practices as they are against the
<BR>
introduction of newly engineered products with what can be perceived
<BR>
as &quot;bad&quot; attributes.
<BR>
<P>The bio-web is delicately balanced -- but as I've pointed out in the
<BR>
Extropian list and at the Foresight conferences -- it is an uncontrolled
<BR>
collection of self-replicating nanomachines with no agenda other than
<BR>
to further copying their own genes.  Consider for example the hundreds of
<BR>
millions of people affected by that nasty little malaria parasite.
<BR>
How exactly to you tradeoff their well-being and even survival
<BR>
against the use of DDT to kill those pesky bugs that carry the
<BR>
parasite, even at the risk of harming secondary species such as birds?
<BR>
<P>Can you define some principles or sets of moral criteria that would
<BR>
allow weighing the goals and interests of live, breathing, conscious
<BR>
humans against the maintenance of a &quot;whole-istic&quot; and deadly bioweb?
