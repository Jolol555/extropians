<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; If you succeed in this effort, would you still keep the books?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Sure, as a backup, if I can afford the storage. Moreover, the
<BR>
originals contain information not yet scannable with current
<BR>
technology. Scanning won't grab the fonts, nor the little vignettes,
<BR>
will do a mess to rasterized illustrations, nor get the paper's
<BR>
texture, nor smell.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; I like books. I like the feel of paper in my hand, and reading
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; from a printed page. I like bringing a volume on buses, trains,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to cafes. I like sitting on my couch with afghan around me with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; my favorite music playing, a small reading light and maybe some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; candles and a glass of wine.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Would this really be all that different, with a digital paper ebook
<BR>
slate, or a really good headup? Bookmarks will never slide out nor
<BR>
uglyfy books, annotation (whether ASCII or audio) is painless, you can
<BR>
ask the book to read you a passage, search with advanced syntax and
<BR>
cut and paste from it. Plus, you can carry the ton or so of your books
<BR>
under your arm or on your belt -- always -- and have a couple of
<BR>
backups stored in a different locations. And you can give a copy of a
<BR>
rare book to your friend, while still keeping it (yes, I'll be happy
<BR>
to slip the original author a cyberbuck in the process). And the darn
<BR>
things will never get dusty, nor mildewed, nor damaged in transport.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; My books reflect some decades of thinking and interests and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; evolving and having them around me is like wearing a comfortable piece
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of clothing. I don't feel at home, until my books are out of the
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely, and some people have absolutely amazing information stored 
<BR>
in theirs. Pooling information from special topics would greatly
<BR>
increase utility, a few people could cover a field exhaustively. I
<BR>
would kill to be able to raid Mike Darwin's library.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; boxes and onto the shelves. If I design a virtual reality of my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; home in the future, the virtual reality would have to have shelves
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of my books. For my future version of myself, I would design
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; myself still liking books.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I don't like reading long texts electronically. I would be tickled
</EM><BR>
<P>No mistake, current display technology sucks very badly. I wouldn't
<BR>
mind a ruggedized 1280x1024 15&quot; TFT slate, though. But we should be
<BR>
able to do even better than paper, eventually. &quot;A Young Lady's
<BR>
Illustrated Primer&quot; has certainly gotten some nice features...
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; pink to have my books electronically available with which to search,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; so I would like electronic versions too, although I would ideally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; like to be able to search on equations too.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Alas, in three decades of computing we haven't managed to create a
<BR>
decent document standard -- this is hardly rocket science, is it? It's
<BR>
either about typography or about searchability or hyperlinks, and
<BR>
never about all of them, or heavensforbid! openness and long life time
<BR>
of the standard. This really shakes my faith into digital technology,
<BR>
and the people behind it. And the librarians fear technology like the
<BR>
plague, anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I'm finding that my small library, (average in comparison
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to my Bay Area friends). is unusual among my colleagues here in Germany.
</EM><BR>
<P>Large personal libraries are always unusual, regardless of
<BR>
location. People just don't read anymore.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; As my friends and colleagues helped me move a couple of weeks ago,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; it's become a kind of inside joke in my group ('what is in these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; boxes?' 'viele viele bucher ...!'), but I notice that at the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; same time they want to spend hours browsing my books.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I have a sense that many here have similar small libraries; are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; we so unusual to other people?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hell, yes. I'm surprised you only now notice.
<BR>

<EM> &gt; Eugene says:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;I have the same problem. I even stopped buying dead tree because I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;can't move with them in style
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Please define &quot;in style&quot; ...
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Packing, driving the things to the post office shlepping it in and
<BR>
filling out all the paperwork, receiving (or even picking up),
<BR>
unpacking, installing shelves and putting the books on them undusting,
<BR>
and the like. I do certainly have far less trouble with the stuff on
<BR>
my hard drive. Of course, here I have to worry about long-term
<BR>
readability of all the .ps.Z, ps.gz and .pdf. I already have 2-3 files
<BR>
which zcat nor gzip can't read but gv can, a lot of .pdfs which break
<BR>
gv (and xpdf can't render antialiased fonts, and has a GUI from hell
<BR>
-- and I don't want to get hooked on proprietary Adobe Acrobat, which
<BR>
won't run on my current glibcless box, anyway), have to think about
<BR>
searching .pdf and .ps, about the threat of head crashes, about
<BR>
migrating the stuff to a new machine, etc.
<BR>
<P>The human visual system does change far slower than the onslaught of
<BR>
document pseudostandards, and there is far less mobile context
<BR>
necessary to read a dead tree vs. bits.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;And, yeah, lugging less stuff around does really free the mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Sure, you don't need to devote as much of your brain to keep track
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of those titles. Yes, useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not only that, imagine an advanced search full text index search
<BR>
engine as a front end to your library.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; On the other hand, there's something irresistably gemuetlich about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; having one's books around [and they are best replacement for T.V. (IMO)].
</EM><BR>
<P>I went cold turkey on the idiot box many many years ago. As to books,
<BR>
you have to have sufficient space and money to move them. I did not
<BR>
ship my library to the U.S., and now I'm glad I didn't, because I'm
<BR>
about to go back to academia, and Ph.D. positions are not exactly
<BR>
lavishly paid.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; And living in a foreign country with no fluency in the foreign language,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the local libraries are frustratingly useless for me, so my library has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; become my backup reseach support after the professional journals.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (Even my institute's professional library is weak, especially in comparison
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to large U.S. university libraries. I really miss Stanford's bookstore and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; libraries.)
</EM><BR>
<P>There are definite advantages in living in a large university town,
<BR>
and knowing your local bookstore sources. Sure, now you can also order
<BR>
books online...
