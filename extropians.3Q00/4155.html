----- Original Message -----
<BR>
From: &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20One%20Reality&In-Reply-To=&lt;005f01c016a9$0693af80$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Okay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality = all that exists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True or false?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Sigh.
<BR>
<P>This is the false dichotomy I referred to earlier.
<BR>
<P><P>For instance, it's easy for me to say 'true' because the statement holds no
<BR>
meaning.  You're just switching titles-- instead of 'reality' you want to
<BR>
call it 'all that exists.'  Fine.
<BR>
<P>Do I believe that there is only &quot;one&quot; 'all that exists?'
<BR>
<P>To me the statement is meaningless.  How can you apply 'oneness' to such a
<BR>
concept?
<BR>
<P>The reason I challenged Elierzer's original statement was not that I was
<BR>
saying, &quot;No, no, silly, there's actually SEVEN realities...&quot;  but rather
<BR>
that I was questioning the concept of an absolute reality at all.
<BR>
<P>I don't see reality as a big, ubiquitous, tangible, static, all-encompassing
<BR>
absolute, but rather as a relative, interpretive, intangible, dynamic
<BR>
interaction.  It finds soldity as a mental contruct in the world of the
<BR>
mind, but we cannot directly attribute greater 'existence' to it, as yet,
<BR>
IMHO.  Daniel Ust actually touches on this in a way I partially agree with
<BR>
in one of his responses to us.
<BR>
<P>J.R., I recognize where you're trying to go with this, and I understand why
<BR>
you accuse me of obstinancy.  You want reality to be the sum of all sets-- I
<BR>
get the feeling that you just want to shake me and say &quot;Yes, but 'reality'
<BR>
includes that too!&quot;  What you have to understand is that I am approaching
<BR>
the problem from an entirely different direction.
<BR>
<P>To me, belief in an external reality is the very human act of saying:
<BR>
&quot;there -is- something out there real making all of this stuff happen.  We
<BR>
can't directly see it yet, but we know it's there.&quot;  The belief system has
<BR>
passing similarities to a religion.  And, of course, the adherents say that
<BR>
they -can- see reality directly.
<BR>
<P>And, truth be told, I'm not even saying that those people are wrong.  There
<BR>
may very well be an external reality.  It certainly seems like there is.  I
<BR>
agree that we should act like there is.  So, unlike religious belief, belief
<BR>
in reality has real, tangible, demonstrable benefits that accrue to all
<BR>
believers.
<BR>
<P>Essentially I have complete functional acceptance of the construct of
<BR>
reality, but maintain mental skeptism.  Currently this has no impact on my
<BR>
life other than to make for interesting discussion.  Despite what you were
<BR>
hinting at earlier, this doesn't result in me swerving out in traffic.
<BR>
<P>Can we agree to disagree now?
<BR>
