The British are always quick to see Dystopian Futures wherever they get the 
<BR>
chance. Look at Anthiny Burgess  A Clockwork Orange, or Huxley's Brave New 
<BR>
World, or Orwell's 1984, or even H.G. Well's visions-mostly grim ones.  Is 
<BR>
this commision warning the public of what may occur if technology is applied 
<BR>
by totalitarians, or is it considered desirable by the commission? Ugly 
<BR>
things will happen as long as the human condition remains what it is. But 
<BR>
there is hope, that humans, especially ones with traditions of more freedom 
<BR>
will undermine the attempts of the dictatorships.

<P>&lt;&lt; MEG and Joe live in Brightlands, a secure estate protected by a siren which
<BR>
&nbsp;sounds whenever outsiders try to cross the barbed wire perimeter. They were
<BR>
&nbsp;lucky to pass the vetting procedure because Joe's tag, for a 10-year-old
<BR>
&nbsp;conviction, was removed only a few months ago.
<BR>
&nbsp;It is so unsafe to leave &quot;walled&quot; areas that they work from home, although
<BR>
&nbsp;their computers are linked into the company network so their bosses can
<BR>
&nbsp;tell exactly when they log on and off. Like all respectable citizens, Meg
<BR>
&nbsp;and Joe have registered ID signatures which allow them to shop on the
<BR>
&nbsp;internet, using &quot;virtual booths&quot; to try on clothes.
<BR>
&nbsp;They carry personal radar devices, which warn them if an &quot;unregistered&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;individual is nearby. Their car has a government-installed breathalyser
<BR>
&nbsp;which cuts off the engine automatically if the driver has had a drink. They
<BR>
&nbsp;eat &quot;chicken in a bottle&quot;, a new animal-friendly product which allows them
<BR>
&nbsp;to grow their own meat at home from tissue culture. Perhaps not
<BR>
&nbsp;surprisingly, they drink too much.
<BR>
&nbsp;This is not a science fiction fantasy world, but the Government's own
<BR>
&nbsp;description of how Britain could look in 2020. In the analysis of the
<BR>
&nbsp;businessmen, academics and scientists on the Foresight panels, the internet
<BR>
&nbsp;will have as dramatic an impact on society as the Industrial Revolution.
