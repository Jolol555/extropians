<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On an issue like &quot;owning&quot;, I think it's many-layered, and one might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; want to try to separate the:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * hardwired aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * personal preference aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * cultural aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; * government aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     (if the two have a legal arrangement i.e. legal marriage)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and then see where the &quot;owning&quot; come from. I suspect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cultural aspect is very big.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The &quot;owning&quot; is not all on the part of the men, of course.  Many women want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to &quot;own&quot; their spouses or SO's as well.  The lesbian couples I know have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this same problem with owning each other.  I've said that I prefer having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; women as housemates, but this may well be because the women I've lived with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been friends rather than lovers.  Where I've had male housemates who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were not lovers, they were as pleasant to live with as women, except that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they didn't tend as much to do things like pick bouquets of flowers for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; house and make scones and trifle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Hmm. I would hazard that there are many things, I call them pet peeves
<BR>
=), that all people who live in proximity do (or don't do) that make
<BR>
life a little bit of a chore. By the same token, there are probably
<BR>
little things that both men and women do that you would find extremely
<BR>
pleasant in your living arrangement. Indeed, you've mentioned some
<BR>
already.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I found difficult to bear about marriage, and why I bailed even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my husband was a wonderful person, was the way in which it made life...how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can I say this?...predictable? stable? These are things that many people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I've heard this claim many, many times. In fact, you could say this
<BR>
about any aspect of your life that needs to have consistency. When you
<BR>
decide to enter into an entertwined life arrangement, you need quite a
<BR>
bit of consistency, that is predictability, in order for that
<BR>
relationship to function. Now, you can (with some work to be sure) make
<BR>
a relationship more dynamic, more chaotic, but what this needs is
<BR>
primarily two things: 1) A strong understanding of the *type* of
<BR>
commitment you and the other want to have, and 2) Communication. I can't
<BR>
stress number two enough. It is the only route by which problems will
<BR>
ever be resolved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; WANT in their lives, but I hated the feeling that I couldn't decide on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spur of the moment to take off for a weekend in Mexico, and especially I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hated never being alone.  I seem to have a requirement for a certain minimum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of solitude, but when I tried to go off by myself my husband would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think I was angry with him--which I soon would be when he kept pressing me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be with him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Pardon my presumption, but if you honestly talked to him about this and
<BR>
no progress was made, you made the rational choice by vacating the
<BR>
relationship. Regret shouldn't ever enter into it. And, imo, as a side
<BR>
note, regret is a useless concept in general.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A lot of this is personal to me, and though it may have something to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cultural position of women relative to men, it may have more to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my own greater than usual need for solitude and self-direction.  When I left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my husband, I resolved never to inflict myself on another man ever again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I've pretty much held to that resolution. Sometimes, though, I wish it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't have to be so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
It doesn't. There are people out there who have what they consider to be
<BR>
perfect relationships (marriages even) where they frequently go days
<BR>
without seeing or speaking to one another.
<BR>
<P>Your use of the word 'inflict' is curious. Care to elaborate? =) Sorry,
<BR>
it's that psychotherapy thread that's bleeding over into my keyboarding.
