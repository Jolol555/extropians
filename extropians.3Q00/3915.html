First of all my response here is a 'quick take', rather then an astute 
<BR>
analysis of your hypothesis. My first observation inspires me to remember 
<BR>
Eugene Wigner's lecture in 1961 regarding the Extrodinary Accuracy of 
<BR>
Mathematics. (I am para-phrasing!)
<BR>
<P>You approach seems to be along the lines of theorists such as Max Tegmark, 
<BR>
James Higo, Jacque Mallah, and others on Wei Dai's Everything list. Nick 
<BR>
Bostrom has his version of your hypothesis (he did it for a Phd. thesis at 
<BR>
Oxford just this year) These theories have several flavors, and for the most 
<BR>
part I have considerable trouble understanding them, conceptually, so bear 
<BR>
with me. 
<BR>
<P>Observer -oriented theories are the hot properties nowadays, simply because 
<BR>
they simply a lot of physics, however-falsifiabliity, is one of their 
<BR>
weaknesses. Both Stapp and in his own fashion Moravec seem to see 
<BR>
counsciousness, from a purely physical point of view as being akin to an 
<BR>
electron collapsing to a ground state. 
<BR>
<P>Quantum mysticism asside, theories such as these are useful, primarilly, in 
<BR>
the long term and answering some of the Big Questions. Accelerating the 
<BR>
quality of life and the length of existence itself , might be a different 
<BR>
genre' altogether. Why? Because people looking at the ultimate state of the 
<BR>
universe, the restoration of life, may disdain such projects as cryogenics 
<BR>
and uploading. (the parting on the left is now parting on the right?) I for 
<BR>
one am a big, fat, pragamtist, who says freeze, cure, upload, whatever we 
<BR>
have to do to save lives and make it better for all.
<BR>
<P>My final concern, and maybe this is one you ought not to try to answer is; 
<BR>
what do you see as the physical mechanism for mind and its post-mortem 
<BR>
preservation? Will we have to bulid hyper-netowrks capable of soul-cathching, 
<BR>
or is there a physical process already in place, existing in the universe, 
<BR>
and what might that be?  Possible joke responses (I can hear them already)
