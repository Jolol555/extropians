<P><EM>&gt; Corporations are a matter of people getting together cooperatively to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organize their efforts.  How can it be evil for a group of people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voluntarily organize, and to offer jobs to others?  Every aspect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the process, from the formation of the corporation, to the job offer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the acceptance, is voluntary and agreed to by all concerned.
</EM><BR>
<P>Evil? Who said anything about evil?  For matters of clarity lets keep the morality issue
<BR>
out of this.
<BR>
<P>All I'm trying to do is open a can of worms that I think needs to be opened.  For
<BR>
starters, when I use the word corporation I'm referring to ones large enough to influence
<BR>
public policy and legislation at both the state and federal level. Companies with a legion
<BR>
of lawyers the size of small cities.
<BR>
<P>Michael Lorrey talked about the tyranny of a majority infringing on the minority.  I agree
<BR>
with him on this - and applied to corporations you have large corporations changing the
<BR>
legal framework to suit their own financial interests as is clearly the case with the DMCA
<BR>
and its obvious infringement on the 1st amendment.
<BR>
<P>What I see advocated here is the almighty dollar.  I just now remembered Bucky Fuller when
<BR>
he said, &quot;You can either make money, or you can make sense.&quot;  What I see advocated is
<BR>
putting corporations and their profits above ALL else.  If it comes down to free speech or
<BR>
lost revenue, free speech has got to go.  DeCSS anyone?  If it comes down to right to bear
<BR>
arms, or lost revenue - the guns have got to go.  If it comes down to right to
<BR>
unreasonable search and seizure or lost revenues - right of unreasonable search has got to
<BR>
go.  Drug testing anyone?
<BR>
<P>The rights of ownership instill on their owners a certain freedom and autonomy from
<BR>
tyranny.  So now you see corporations increasingly moving away from selling and replacing
<BR>
it with leasing.  .NET anyone?  At first you could pay just once $49.99 to own your
<BR>
software.  But with leasing, you will pay $10 today, and tomorrow and the next month, and
<BR>
so, and so on.  &quot;And oh, we decided that to continue to use our service, its going to cost
<BR>
you $30 a month!  Sorry, we found out that you used our service to disparage our companies
<BR>
good name - service terminated!&quot;
<BR>
<P>And at the current clip of mergers and consolidations, what choice will you have left?  If
<BR>
the only game in town is the large corporation, then that means that for a good part of
<BR>
your life if you care not to live in a tent, you will have to give up your individual
<BR>
sovereignty and freedom while employed.  And without the so-called government that
<BR>
everyone around here likes to knock around, they would probably own us full-time - company
<BR>
leased house, company leased cars, company owned shops.  Thank god for the semblance of
<BR>
law and a legion of law enforcement to back it up.  What am I saying? This is all a
<BR>
first.  But it has become obvious to me that corporations could give a damn about me and
<BR>
my freedoms.  At least the government has the pretense of a constitutional guarantee of
<BR>
freedom.
<BR>
<P>The biggest 'bug' I see in a free-market is there are no gauruntees of freedom -
<BR>
Everything is up for grabs!!!  All that matters is the almighty buck, he with the most
<BR>
money wins!
