Something else to throw on the pile...
<BR>
<P>Holding my wallet and looking through i this morning, I was struck by the 
<BR>
question of &quot;what is money?&quot;  Aside from all the things taught in economics 
<BR>
classes, at its core, money is a measure of value.  But in the end, isn't value
<BR>
subjective anyway? 
<BR>
<P>Or, to put it a different way, what will be valued in radically different 
<BR>
situations?  Consider, for example, a manned independent colony on Mars.  The
<BR>
things that would be of value ot the Martians would be MUCH different from 
<BR>
those things of value to people here on Earth.  On Mars, one might not think
<BR>
of paying a week's salary for a month of air - yet here on earth that would
<BR>
be ludicrous.  The changed dynamic of what it takes to survive should radically
<BR>
change our definition of common concepts such as value, wealth, and money.  
<BR>
<P>Where this really changes things is in industrial economics, however.  Consider
<BR>
a more mundane example - a settlement high in the mountains of central New 
<BR>
Guinea.  Due to environmental and social constraints (i.e. headhunters) it is 
<BR>
difficult to get petroleum products up to your settlement, and additionally it
<BR>
is also impossible to run electrical lines from the nearest power generation
<BR>
station down in the lowlands.  At this point, because of external effects, 
<BR>
power generation may be better performed through &quot;uneconomical&quot; means, such as
<BR>
fuel cells of photovoltaics, given that the &quot;value&quot; of low maintenance, 
<BR>
continual yield, field repairable (in some cases) electrical generation is much
<BR>
more important than the raw cost of extracting the fuel source.  Thus what
<BR>
would be considered both expensive and foolish to most would have value, even 
<BR>
in a terrestrial situation.
<BR>
<P>The point here is the question of what will determine value in an 
<BR>
extraterrestrial setting? Take the Mars situation: Square feet of living
<BR>
space, cubic feet of air, ounces of water... which of these will be the most
<BR>
impotant, and which will fuel the medium of exchange?
<BR>
<P>Additionally, for colonization issues, the industrial economics of the
<BR>
situation need to be considered.  For example, it still might be cheaper in 
<BR>
electrical yield per poun of equipment to bring a propane generator (propane
<BR>
can be synthesized from waste, anyway), but in terms of sustainability and the 
<BR>
decreased use of air it would be &quot;cheaper&quot; to use more &quot;expensive&quot; 
<BR>
technologies, such as electrochemical generation, fuel cells, photovoltaics,
<BR>
or temperature gradient induction to do the same thing.
