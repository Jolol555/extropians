<EM>&gt;There is a large literature on the economics of population that I am

<EM>&gt;making a better product hurts your competitors, but in a competitive

<EM>&gt;Yes, but in current realities, people do not expect to have to

<EM>&gt;compete with their children.  In my personal reality, I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expect that to be true (i.e. I live long enough that my children
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compete against me.) -- so why would I want to allow the copying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(and/or reeducation) of my skill base.)  To extend it further,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;why would I even want to have children (other than the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I can't reprogram my genetic drives)?!?.

<EM>&gt;You are going to have to provide a significant ROI for people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who expect to be competed out of the market due to copying before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they happily accept it.   Is this incorporated into your wage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;model?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here is a more step by step argument:
<BR>
1) Allowing market competition generically allows some groups to
<BR>
lose by being out-competed.
<BR>
2) In the simplest standard models, allowing competition is a
<BR>
net gain, where winners win more than the losers lose.  (Such
<BR>
simple models seem appropriate in this case.)
<BR>
3) Thus, if one could identify how much each person won or lost,
<BR>
one could arrange extra transfers to that *everyone* benefited
<BR>
from the change.
<BR>
4) Typically such transfers are not arranged, but sometimes they
<BR>
are via taxes or court settlements.
<BR>
5) Even without tax transfers, people could individually and
<BR>
privately they would win on net by sufficiently diversifying
<BR>
their asset portfolio.
