<P>
I'm still hoping this thread generates some debate.  To me it seems,
<BR>
this one of the more important challenge we're going to have to face
<BR>
over the next decade.
<BR>
<P>Below is a post I made to the Transdot site about nanotech property
<BR>
rights, and a thoughtful response by Saige follows:
<BR>
<P>Its quite possible the assembler won't be for sale, at least not to the
<BR>
general public. Large companies who can afford a 10-50 billion dollar
<BR>
price  tag, may likely obtain licensing rights for its use, but that's a
<BR>
far cry from the average joe owning it. Basically the first company to
<BR>
develop the assembler, lets say Zyvex, has the potential to completely
<BR>
dominate the economy from that point forward. Zyvex could either retain
<BR>
sole rights to own and use the assembler, or they could develop strict
<BR>
licensing agreements where other companies can have their own
<BR>
assemblers, as long as they pay Zyvex an initial $10 billion and 20%
<BR>
royalties on all future profits. That being the case, Zyvex would
<BR>
quickly become the worlds first trillion dollar company, and thats not
<BR>
counting its holdings on Wall Street!
<BR>
<P>So where's the hope you say? Competition of course! Hopefully, the first
<BR>
company to develop this assembler will not obtain all-inclusive patent
<BR>
rights thereby allowing a sufficient number of  competitors to enter the
<BR>
race. Since nanotech has the potential to bring prices of all material
<BR>
goods down to near-zero, that is exactly what will happen if enough
<BR>
competition exists. The current long distance rates are a perfect
<BR>
example of competitive price lowering. Why charge $10/pound for
<BR>
nanomaterials when it costs less than 5 cents/pound to produce? That
<BR>
means you can triple your profits by only charging 15 cents/pound. With
<BR>
enough competition, nanomaterials would soon reach very cheap price
<BR>
points.
<BR>
<P>Saige Responds:
<BR>
<P>...Thats what I fear the most... That either one company, or multiple
<BR>
companies, will develop this technology and abuse the current
<BR>
intellectual property laws to keep it to themselves, and establish
<BR>
pretty much control over things.
<BR>
<P>After all, wealth isn't really an objective thing, but a subjective
<BR>
thing. Being wealthy is determined by how much more you have than other
<BR>
people. And while after developing this technology they may not have
<BR>
nearly as much need for money themselves, they still have the ability to
<BR>
gain power by keeping it away from other people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From a corporate view, it would actually be wrong to make this
</EM><BR>
technology available to others.  A corporation is all about gaining
<BR>
wealth and power, and that's exactly what the corporate ethics are. To
<BR>
them, it would be unethical to make it available to others, because it
<BR>
would directly oppose their main goal of profit.
<BR>
<P>To be honest, I'd rather not have nanotechnology, then have it under the
<BR>
complete control of a corporation or two, but be unavailable to me
<BR>
except the goods produced by it. (And likely not the best ones possible,
<BR>
so to guarantee people having to make repeat purchases.)
