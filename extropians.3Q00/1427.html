</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah. Well, I thought I would ask, because if you were a believer in Gaea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Theory, then your use of the word spiritual to mean a 'connection' with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that entity, I would capitulate and agree your usage is appropriate.
</EM><BR>
<P>But in the Gaea Theory, the term Gaea would refer to a specific, bounded
<BR>
entity, not &quot;surroundings&quot; or &quot;environment.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Cause and effect link? Hmmm. I'm trying to see what you mean by this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given the example you posted a while back. When you released the coyote,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that was the cause which generated the effect of being able to commune
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with it?
</EM><BR>
<P>The cause of the communication which occurred between me and the coyote
<BR>
could have been some as yet unidentified property of consciousness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interesting. Why not?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not consider a feeling as an explanation?  Because a feeling is not an
<BR>
explanation. If you equate feelings with explanations you're throwing away
<BR>
more than just precision in language. To explain (according to my
<BR>
dictionary) is to show logical development or relationships. To confuse this
<BR>
with a feeling or hunch would probably be fatal to me within a short time,
<BR>
since I work with dangerous stuff like electricity and chainsaws, and depend
<BR>
on explanations of how plants grow and which wild plants are edible and so
<BR>
forth in oder to eat.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Also, one of the definitions is an appeal to higher
<BR>
<EM>&gt; emotions or an aesthetic sense, which definitely gets across the feeling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe you are describing.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;It's true that I experienced feelings in connection with the coyote.  These
<BR>
feelings included surprise (to find the coyote in the fence), sorrow (that
<BR>
the coyote had gotten her leg caught), happpiness (that she was still able
<BR>
to run after I got her leg free), curiosity (&quot;Gee, I wonder how this coyote
<BR>
is able to understand that I'm trying to help her&quot;), and what you might call
<BR>
love, in that I felt a kinship to the coyote, as one living thing to
<BR>
another. Maybe this last is what you mean by higher emotion?
