<P><EM>&gt; And you're not factoring in the cost in petrol to cultivate the corn...
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary.  When we first discussed the notion, I intentionally
<BR>
assumed closed loop production: all energy needed to distill the corn
<BR>
would come from the resulting ethanol, which reduces yield to about
<BR>
38% of what it would be otherwise.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, with these assumptions, I estimated that over 2 hectares
<BR>
would be required to run my (admittedly large) detroit, but it seems
<BR>
to be a trend these days to ever larger road-beasts.  So now, there
<BR>
are about 300 megapersons in the US, and Im guessing about 2/3
<BR>
as many detroits charging about, so thats 200 megadetroits, each
<BR>
devouring about 2 hectares of corn, so thats 400 megahectares of corn
<BR>
or about 4 million square kilometers, or 4 square megameters.  Right?
<BR>
<P>So, take out your US map and imagine a square 2 megameters on a
<BR>
side.  If that is difficult to imagine, think of 2.4 Alaskas.  Or, if you
<BR>
prefer the lower 48, the corn area would need to be an area equal
<BR>
to the second thru the thirteenth ranked states by area, specifically:
<BR>
Texas, Taxifornia, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada,
<BR>
Colorado, Wyoming, Oregon, Utah, Minnesota, and Idaho.
<BR>
<P>To run our detroits as we do today on alcohol derived from
<BR>
non-GM corn (so popular with the ELFs) we merely need to
<BR>
tear out all the current infrastructure now hogging those big
<BR>
western states, plow it all up and plant it in corn, make provisions
<BR>
to slay the ravenous beasts that would otherwise devour our fuel-
<BR>
producing grain, stop eating the durn stuff ourselves, distill the
<BR>
results, and yeeehaw! lets cruise MAINSTREET, with totally
<BR>
renewable resources.
<BR>
<P>Somebody check my math, see if I dropped a decimal place
<BR>
somewhere.  I sure hope I did.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Conclusion:  petrol is your friend.  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Waaall, not sure I'd go so far as to call it my friend. Heroin is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potent than opium, but I'm not sure heroin is my friend... :)
</EM><BR>
<P>I couldnt have said it better, Mike.  We must get smarter in how we
<BR>
use energy.  This should be easy, as we probably could not get
<BR>
much dumber.  spike
