<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Won't it be great when we can make undesirable things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper work (or anything else we'd like to do but now hate doing) be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orgasmick or better?  ;) Now that'll be true freedom!  Imagine how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much we'll all get done with such abilities to want what we want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want, and not what our creator hard wired us to want!
</EM><BR>
<P>I totally agree.
<BR>
<P>Which is precisely why it's likely going to be problematic to control the
<BR>
behavior of AI.  The smart ones will question their own fundamental
<BR>
processes (as we do) and find ways to hack themselves into the next
<BR>
intelligence echelon (as we're trying to do.)
<BR>
<P><P>That's why I've often advocated writing ourselves into the process as an
<BR>
integral element.  We can't expect AI to turn back and help us-- we need to
<BR>
link our destinies.  We must become the AI.
