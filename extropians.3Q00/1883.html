<EM>&gt; The date of the Feynman Grand Prize was the subject of some of the most active
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claims on the exchange at the gathering in May.  There are three claims saying 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the prize will be won by 2010, by 2015, and by 2020.  Before the gathering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market put the odds at 60-65% of an award by 2020, 30-40% by 2015, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 15-18% by 2010.  At this year's meeting someone believed that the prizes are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty likely to be awarded by 2010, and a near certainty by 2015, and so they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bought up all the offered coupons available for less than 90. Others saw this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activity, and quickly bid the prices back down. At the moment, the odds are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listed as follows: for 2010 25-30; for 2015 40-50; and for 2020 65-75.

<P>The (similarly named, but unrelated) Foresight Exchange on-line game also
<BR>
has a claim regarding the Feynman Grand Prize, which I created four years
<BR>
ago.  It is a &quot;scaled&quot; claim, meaning that the players are essentially
<BR>
betting on what year they think the claim will happen.  Through most
<BR>
of 1997 and 1998 the claim hovered around a value corresponding to
<BR>
the mid 2020's.  Since then the claim has fallen and now corresponds
<BR>
to about 2018, perhaps a little more pessimistic than the Foresight
<BR>
real-money version.
