<EM>&gt; &gt; A short and sweet article on neo-luddites from Reason magazine. Thought it

<EM>&gt; &gt; could be interesting to extropians.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The article is about the Turning Point Project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Turning Point Project appears to be the first antitechnology organization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aimed specifically at the Singularity - they specifically oppose genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence.

<EM>&gt; I'm not sure what the implications are - whether this means that technologists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should try to create the future quietly and unobtrusively, or whether this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means we can make all the noise we want, since the Luddites already know about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't *think* these people will have a decisive influence on the future.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt that Congress or the public-at-large will have strong reactions to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech or AI until the first applications actually make it to the market, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least are demonstrated in the laboratory.  But I could be wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where are these people getting their funding?
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the webmasters appears to be Ang Lee, who is known to be a leader in the
<BR>
Ruckus Society and trains leftist commandos at the Societie's boot camp.
<BR>
Miyoko Sakashita is also a co-founder of the Berkeley BREAD Project, a regional
<BR>
currency program, similar to many that seem to sprouting up in leftist
<BR>
communities around the country as a means of keeping consumer money in the city.
<BR>
Amy Bricker seems to work closely with Sakashita, and they both appeared
<BR>
together for an interveiw on ENN' chat site, the transcript of which is here:

<P><A HREF="http://chat.enn.com/transcripts/110299turning.htm">http://chat.enn.com/transcripts/110299turning.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Amy also is a project directory with the Center for Food Safety, an anti-GM
<BR>
group in Washington DC. That she is project director of these two 'groups'
<BR>
indicates to me that these groups are merely fronts for some larger umbrella
<BR>
organization. After more searching, I found that she works with TPP director
<BR>
Andrew Kimbrell on the International Center for Technological Asessment
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the CTA website at <A HREF="http://www.icta.org">http://www.icta.org</A>
</EM><BR>
Executive Director
<BR>
Andrew Kimbrell is a public interest attorney, activist and author. He has been
<BR>
involved in public interest legal activity in numerous areas of technology,
<BR>
human health and the environment. After working eight years as the Policy
<BR>
Director at the Foundation for Economic Trends, Kimbrell established the
<BR>
International Center for Technology Assessment (CTA) in 1994 and the Center for
<BR>
Food Safety (CFS) in 1997. Kimbrell has written several books and given numerous
<BR>
public lectures on a variety of issues. He has been featured on radio and
<BR>
television programs across the country, including The Today Show, the CBS
<BR>
Morning Show, Crossfire, Headlines on Trial, and Good Morning America.  He has
<BR>
lectured at dozens of universities throughout the country and has testified
<BR>
before congressional and regulatory hearings. In 1994, the Utne Reader named
<BR>
Kimbrell as one  of the world's leading 100 visionaries. 
<BR>
<P>Legal Director 
<BR>
Joseph Mendelson, III joined CTA in the Summer of 1995. He brings a career of
<BR>
significant litigation, public advocacy and environmental grassroots organizing
<BR>
to the CFS. Mendelson worked as a staff attorney with the Foundation on Economic
<BR>
Trends and directed the Friends of the Earth's stratospheric ozone protection
<BR>
project. He has authored numerous articles in environmental and legal journals.
<BR>
He has also appeared in numerous media outlets including NBC National News, CNN,
<BR>
CBS News, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. His writing has appeared
<BR>
in numerous publications including the Ecologist, Boston College Environmental
<BR>
Affairs Law Review, Environmental Law Reported, and the Utne Reader. 
<BR>
<P>The rest of the staff at ICTA:
<BR>
Kay van der Horst
<BR>
Research Director,
<BR>
Director Defense and Security Policy
<BR>
<P>Amy Bricker
<BR>
Research Coordinator
<BR>
<P>Jeff Kellog
<BR>
Senior Analyst
<BR>
<P>Jennifer Beck
<BR>
Administrator
<BR>
<P>The CTA is part of a big lobbying group in Washington. They take money from
<BR>
other groups AND corporations to put together 'campaigns'. For example, early
<BR>
indications are that the opposition to the Bt corn varietal is being funded by
<BR>
pesticide companies. Their legal work against automobile pollution is funded by
<BR>
the Natural Resources Defense Council, and other groups which are all funded by
<BR>
Edison Electric, which obviously has the goal of forcing the widespread
<BR>
electrification of automobiles. This reminds me of the way that nuke companies
<BR>
tend to fund groups fighting against the 'Greenhouse Effect', while coal
<BR>
companies used to fund anti-nuke groups. They are playing against people's
<BR>
ignorance to gain their own wealth and influence in government. This is just the
<BR>
sort of thing that many of us are disgusted about with government, however, it
<BR>
is now US whose ox is being gored. We can sit back and take it, or put together
<BR>
some group of our own to affect change if ExI itself wants to maintain a
<BR>
'non-partisan' attitude.
