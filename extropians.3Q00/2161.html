<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, the advocates of multi-culturalism seek to include other (useless to 
</EM><BR>
us) 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  traditions, not to somehow morally equalize them. The part that is hard 
</EM><BR>
for 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  us to get over is that we really DO think our lives are richer, more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  educated, simply BETTER!!  The problem is, how to let the people involved 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  make their OWN judgements on what THEY want. That way the 'superior' 
</EM><BR>
values 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  are chosen, not enforced.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like most Westerners in our time, I was formally educated in an academic 
<BR>
system dominated by more or less explicit &quot;political correctness&quot; (although, 
<BR>
being of an advanced age, this intellectual substrate wasn't as pronounced in 
<BR>
my school days as it seems to be now - we also used to have to walk uphill 
<BR>
three miles both ways to and from school).  Whether you call it &quot;moral 
<BR>
relativism&quot; or the less rhetorically charged term &quot;multi-culturalism,&quot; I've 
<BR>
had to struggle with some inherent contradictions in what can fairly and 
<BR>
neutrally be called this &quot;post-modernist&quot; stance, and I'm the first to admit 
<BR>
that the roots of that contradiction lie in the mentality of the earlier age 
<BR>
(the classic liberalism of the Enlightenment) that I've come adopt as the 
<BR>
default viewpoint of my personal philosophy.  As you correctly identify, that 
<BR>
contradiction lies in the value we place on an individual's autonomy or right 
<BR>
to choose their own way in life, an absolutely fundamental value of classic 
<BR>
liberalism and modern libertarianism.  But the resolution lies in revisiting 
<BR>
and reviving that value.
<BR>
<P>Consider the intractable contradiction for the &quot;hard core multi-culturalist&quot; 
<BR>
in facing something like the treatment of women in Afghanistan: What 
<BR>
viewpoint is &quot;privileged&quot; (to use the post-modernist term) to criticize the 
<BR>
Taliban's prohibition on women taking part in public life?  Returning to the 
<BR>
roots of Western modernism, this conundrum is solved without significant 
<BR>
inconsistency: The Taliban are simply WRONG in their &quot;culture&quot; because they 
<BR>
are infringing the individual autonomy of half the population in their 
<BR>
country.  The modern cultural relativist, though, has inherited an 
<BR>
intervening intellectual heritage that dictates the primacy of &quot;culture&quot; over 
<BR>
the intellectual.  Although there are plenty of antecedents for the notion 
<BR>
before Marx, it was Marx who enshrined the primacy of culture in the 
<BR>
post-Enlightenment period. 
<BR>
<P>The problem arises when we mistake &quot;IS&quot; for &quot;OUGHT&quot;.  The scientific mind-set 
<BR>
of the Enlightenment lead to a critical view of society and human behavior 
<BR>
that yielded the observation that in fact people ARE heavily influenced in 
<BR>
their values and behavior by the culture in which they grow up and live.  The 
<BR>
paralysis of post-modernist cultural relativism arose from abnegating the 
<BR>
possibility of moral judgment and thence the denial of the possibility of 
<BR>
moral action.  The contemporary cultural relativist denies the existence of 
<BR>
any &quot;privileged&quot; cultural viewpoint, but espouses the primacy of culture.  
<BR>
Having abandoned the MORAL foundation of individual autonomy, the cultural 
<BR>
relativist can't resolve the paradox you identify, Nadia.  In fact, the most 
<BR>
radical post-modernists deny the existence of the paradox at all, claiming 
<BR>
that it arises from making what they call the &quot;mistake&quot; of accepting any 
<BR>
particular viewpoint as &quot;privileged&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately, this &quot;paradox&quot; is a false one, and arises from a mistaken 
<BR>
conflation of description and prescription.  Post-modernist &quot;sophistication&quot; 
<BR>
is nothing more than the stubborn refusal to acknowledge this error.
