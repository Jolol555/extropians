I am guessing that there will very little resistence to the things that 
<BR>
Kurzveil focused on, like increased bandwidth and and increased computational 
<BR>
capabilities. The fear of GM food will reduce if it seems safe (over the 
<BR>
years) and tastey, and is probably less of a issue with a forecaster like 
<BR>
Kurzweil. But computer electronics seem a safe bet as just about everyone in 
<BR>
the world likes electronics.

<P>&lt;&lt; Be careful how you use the term &quot;*will*.&quot;  Things will only get better if
<BR>
&nbsp;people decide to make them better...every result requires an action.  I do
<BR>
&nbsp;agree that things will *likely* get better, but it is a potentially fatal
<BR>
&nbsp;oversight to have blind faith in the progress of our society.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I feel that informing people in general about the positive implications of
<BR>
&nbsp;progressive technologies is as important as the creation of the
<BR>
&nbsp;technologies themselves.  One example is with GM foods: so many people have
<BR>
&nbsp;protested the ubiquity of GM foods that manufacturers such as Frito-Lay
<BR>
&nbsp;have publicly asserted their non-use of GM products.  Currently there is
<BR>
&nbsp;major social stigma against GM foods, which is damaging to the science as a
<BR>
&nbsp;whole.  More examples abound.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;You're probably right, Zero...we *will* get there; but I, for one, don't
<BR>
&nbsp;want to be lynched along the way. &gt;&gt;
