<P>Dont worry Mike, my ideal is entirely *voluntary* surveillance {except, I suppose,
<BR>
for criminals, who would be watched against their will.}  Your comment regarding
<BR>
increased vigilantism, etc, caused me to wonder how many deviants there are
<BR>
in society.  I would suspect not that many, and we could reserve a big state like
<BR>
Nevada that stays free of surveillance.
<BR>
<P>Regarding the prudish causing headaches, The prudish would find themselves
<BR>
marginalized in a transparent society.  Who would want them in charge of
<BR>
anything?  Furthermore, my notion of surveillance and transparency
<BR>
has nothing to do with what is done in ones home.  I acknowledge the possibility
<BR>
of bug-borne cameras, but even I am against those.  I would consider
<BR>
it a worthwhile pursuit figure ways to defeat such devices.
<BR>
<P>U-surv in public places only, kinda like what they are doing in London.  People
<BR>
are not free if they must fear thugs.  And no, we are not free if we need to
<BR>
carry sidearms whenever we go where there are masses of proletariat.  England's
<BR>
cameras and face recognition software is a good way to clean up a bad
<BR>
area of town.  I doubt it would lead to a police state.  spike
