<EM>&gt;From: &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;F211R0F3praZfBGagwi00004d54@hotmail.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;Michael S. Lorrey writes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Primarily because it is on a virtual system that is dependent upon us in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real world to maintain. Just as I would not let a child loose in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without supervision, I would not let a new AI loose on the net or have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capabilities in the real world which limited our ability to supervise 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it. Once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it has proven its ability and good will, controls may be loosened, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; such entity should always have an off switch of some kind, just as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humans do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In further support of your comments, I'd add that the &quot;off switch&quot; for an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;AI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could actually terminate or delete it. This means that it would be *much* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to control unruly AIs than to control human children, since we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(unfortunately?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can't actually terminate recalcitrant or sociopathic (i.e., unfriendly) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Furthermore, AIs could compete with each other to see who could be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friendliest, and only the most friendly would be allowed to replicate -- 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rest being discarded. Similar treatment of human child populations might 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;meet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with resistance from their mothers (to say the least).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a result, we can deal much more severely and harshly with Mind Children 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we can deal with human children. Bottom line: I think we have more to fear 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fiendish human hackers than from Spiritual Machines, Robo sapiens, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Artilects, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mind Children.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny.  We all expect that eventually the AI will be exponentially more 
<BR>
intelligent than humans, but at the same time *some* of us expect that we'll 
<BR>
somehow be able to keep that genie safely trapped in his bottle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Really, Zero, do you still beat your parents for being so fearful of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tyranny, or are they already buried in the back yard?
</EM><BR>
<P>Its comments like that that keep you in my killfile.
