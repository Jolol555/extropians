<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We are not talking about any such civilized rate of change at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is nowhere left to go for increasing levels of workers (largely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following the IQ Bell Curve).  If you think it can't happen to me or to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you then I don't think you are paying attention.  Capitalism and waving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hands is not an answer.
</EM><BR>
<P>What's this about &quot;waving the hands&quot;? I'm not worried about it happening to me,
<BR>
because I've always considered my life as something that I did nothing to
<BR>
deserve -- it was given to me without my even asking for it. So, I've really got
<BR>
nothing to lose, and if I manage to partake of the TS, well... that's just more
<BR>
undeserved beatitude.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And the day after full nanotech or transhuman AI almost all of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money and your holdings are worthless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds good to me. Let it happen right now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think you are missing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pressing need to have some idea of how to reform society and economics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before we get to that day and even at various quite mundane points along
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the way.  Please tell me if I am wrong and convince me if you can.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would very much like to believe the world is as simple as some seem wont
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to see it.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not for me to try to convince you of anything. This thread intends only to
<BR>
discuss why an AI would want to be friendly. I remain of the opinion that an AI
<BR>
would want to be friendly because it will be genetically programmed to do so.
<BR>
The more I think about it, the more I meditate on it, the more I'd like the TS
<BR>
to happen right now.
<BR>
<P>Onward! Faster! Faster!
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>Good night... pleasant dreams.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Law reflects, but in no sense determines the moral worth of a
<BR>
society.... The better the society, the less law there will be. In
<BR>
Heaven, there will be no law, and the lion will lie down with the
<BR>
lamb.... The worse the society, the more law there will be. In Hell,
<BR>
there will be nothing but law, and due process will be meticulously
<BR>
observed.&quot;
<BR>
