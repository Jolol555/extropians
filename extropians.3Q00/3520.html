<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Granted I'm not on the &quot;front lines&quot; or anything (heck I ain't even on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; battlefield), but the more I read the less optimistic I become.  My
</EM><BR>
current
<BR>
<EM>&gt; estimate is circa '40.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think you're almost certainly correct insofar as I suspect the issues are
<BR>
not quite as straightforward as some of the guys drawing the graphs seem to
<BR>
believe.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure we humans still have a few surprises in store for us in our quest
<BR>
for engineered intelligence.  I don't think that anyone who knows anything
<BR>
about the human computer will pretend that the answers are clear.
<BR>
<P>We project future innovation on the basis of current processes: this is
<BR>
probably not a bad way to listen to the future, but I think it's clear that
<BR>
we can't rule out major paradigm shifts or fundamental technical hurdles.
<BR>
<P>Reality doesn't know to follow the curve.
<BR>
<P>Currently the human computer -does- have logical limits on its ability to
<BR>
think.  We are *just* of intelligence necessary to be considered smart here
<BR>
folks-- we are just a single echelon above the higer primates.
<BR>
<P>Hey, don't get me wrong, it's a good echelon to be on.  It's a significant
<BR>
step.
<BR>
<P>In fact, it's a great one-- I believe that we are just of the intelligence
<BR>
necessary to realize the need for us to become more intelligent.
<BR>
<P>I hope it happens quickly, I do, but it's a little early in the game yet to
<BR>
rule out catastrophic circumstances.
