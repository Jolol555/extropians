<P><EM> &gt; Granted, growing corn and distilling the result is not the best way to

<EM> &gt; capture solar energy, but it does give one a feel for orders of magnitude.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; When one hears some yahoo say:  &quot;Hey, if we put solar panels on our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cars, and let them charge during the day, we could run our cars on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; electricity.&quot;  After this exercise, we know that that person isnt even in
</EM><BR>
<P>This is silly. Why would one want to cover your car with solar cells?
<BR>
It hardly produces enough power to directly drive an ultralite
<BR>
manta-style vehicle during high summer in Oz. The only reason to put
<BR>
thin-film cells on your roof, is to ventilate/cool your car in the
<BR>
parking lot while trickle-charging your battery.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; the right order of magnitude.  Another way to look at it is this: if a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; parking lot capable of comfortably holding about 600 cars were to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; be dug up, planted in corn and the result distilled, the ethanol produced
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; could be used to power one of those 600, assuming it is an average
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; American guzzler driven an average amount.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; That same area, covered with solar cells would be able to power
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; about 15 of those 600 cars.  If the cars were all state of the art
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; electrics, the parking lot could power about 25 of em.

A fairly average U.S. family has 2-3 cars (I know, I've seen
<BR>
them. Dunno about trailer trash, though). Most of them stand around in
<BR>
the residential area during most of the day. Assuming a residential
<BR>
roof area of 100 m^2 (I have no idea how accurate that is), our 10% of
<BR>
500 W average insolation gives us 50 W*100 = 5 kW during most of the
<BR>
daytime. Now most normal (gasoline-guzzling, steel coffin) type of car
<BR>
do quite ok on an energy budget of 30-40 kW. A composite (hybrid)
<BR>
electrical car with spike cache should do nicely (i.e. have a kick-ass
<BR>
acceleration and very acceptable (for the U.S., that is) cruise speed)
<BR>
on a fraction of that. Given that you can't recharge your EV battery
<BR>
with full juice without damaging it, 5 kW sustainable performance
<BR>
during daylight hours seems the optimal ballpark figure to recharge
<BR>
your 2-3 cars hanging around in the residential area.
<BR>
<P>See, I can twist numbers, too :p
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Conclusion:  petrol is your friend.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Energy is your friend. 
<BR>
<P>Gasoline has a relatively high power density, but is lousy if you want
<BR>
to burn it just in carbon dioxide and water (what I would call zero
<BR>
emission, only idiots without common sense would still point at the
<BR>
faint whiff of carbon dioxide still emitted) in a non-Carnot process,
<BR>
and it has a nasty tendency that you have to drill (and sometimes
<BR>
shoot) for it in faraway places, generate a lot of muck in situ and
<BR>
during the transport, and suffer the refined product to be under the
<BR>
control of a monopoly-type of distributors, and the feds holding out
<BR>
their greedy little paws (70% of fuel costs in Germany are diverse
<BR>
*taxes*).
<BR>
<P>Methanol has a slightly less power density, but you can easily make it
<BR>
from any organic material (including gas, oil, coal and renewables) in
<BR>
the country, it readily mixes with water, is rapidly fully
<BR>
biodegradable, is less toxic than gasoline (unless drunk), can be
<BR>
consumed both in the ICU (with less emissions than gasoline), unlike
<BR>
hydrogen can be stored in a normal fuel tank, can be readily reformed
<BR>
into fuel-cell-grade hydrogen/carbon dioxide in small onboard reactors
<BR>
and also can directly power alcohol fuel cells. Yeah, and in the
<BR>
future with engineered photosynthesis you can make solar panels which
<BR>
fix carbon dioxide from air (or other sources) and generate methanol
<BR>
directly on your roof.
<BR>
<P>Dunno, looks like a winner to me.
