<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----

<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20Glowing%20Grass&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGAEEKFKAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<P><EM>&gt; Note also that it helps to be aware of the real hazards of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industrialization of GM technology.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The &quot;terminator&quot; gene was one of the most hostile moves I've EVER seen one
<BR>
group of humans try to make against another.  There is no reason to believe
<BR>
that the gene would not have been passed to other members of the same and
<BR>
closely related species.  Maize (called &quot;corn&quot; in the US), for example,
<BR>
pollinates other maize, as well as closely related wild species such as
<BR>
teosinte up to distances of two miles. The teosinte can then cross pollinate
<BR>
other corn.
<BR>
<P>Farmers who typically save their own seed and whose crops had been
<BR>
contaminated with the terminator gene would not be aware of the damage until
<BR>
the following year when they planted seed they'd saved and a large per
<BR>
centage of the seed did not germinate.  You might argue (and I HAVE seen
<BR>
unthinking people make this very argument) that no contaminated lines of
<BR>
corn could be established since the seed would be infertile.  This is true,
<BR>
but it would be of little comfort to the farmer who gets only 1/3 of her
<BR>
usual yield (and no doubt a certain per centage of this seed would also be
<BR>
contaiminated from cross pollination from fields of corn carrying the
<BR>
terminator gene).  Corn is quite vulnerable to inbreeding depression, and in
<BR>
order to maintain a healthy line of corn one must take seed from at least
<BR>
200 ears.  Small farmers growing maybe only an acre of corn would have to
<BR>
save many more ears than usual and would have to pre-germinate the seed
<BR>
before planting in order not to take up space in the field with infertile
<BR>
seed.
<BR>
<P>The net effect would be that many farmers operating within cross-pollination
<BR>
distance of fields of terminator gene corn would be forced to purchase their
<BR>
seed.  Unfortunately, for many small susistence farmers this would mean the
<BR>
end of farming.
<BR>
<P>When I see a person or group of people doing something viciously cruel, I
<BR>
tend not to trust them, nor do I want to deal with them in any way.  This is
<BR>
the way I feel about Monsanto and the USDA.
<BR>
