</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How to bring up this point?  I know I'm not the only one to wonder this, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here goes...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is the core idea of Extropy (as I understand it, summarized by &quot;Upward and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Outward&quot;) predicated on a libertarian philosophy?  Does one have to accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the other excess baggage that comes with libertarianism (i.e. absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom to own and use firearms, no centralized legal systems, decentralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or no environmental regulations, no public investment from non-private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizations, etc.) to be a true extropian?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I ask this question as a believer in the concepts of expanding beyond what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are accepted as &quot;common&quot; limitations - overcoming such barriers as aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pathologies and death, limitations of the physical body (strength, endurance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.), limitations of input bandwidth and storage, gravity wells, the speed of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light...  All of these things that we can and SHOULD overcome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not, and cannot, accept the fundamental assumptions that seem to underly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarianism - the axioms, often implicit, are ones I cannot accept, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as I cannot accept the axioms that underly Christianity or Scientology.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can accept an dsympathize with many of the ideas underlying the political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy, and am at least friendly to most.  My issues are those of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation - the practical questions that need to be answered before a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political philosophy becomes a political system.  That having been said,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I need to ask this in plain language:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is everyone out there on this list a libertarian, or is that just the air this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list puts forward?  Because if that's the cost of entry...  I don't know if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can continue to provide constructive input into a discussion where I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy into the same basic assumptions.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the great things about libertarianism is consent. I don't care if YOU
<BR>
want to live in a repressive communal society, so long as you don't force ME to
<BR>
do the same, or if I want to try it out, you can't force me to stay if I change
<BR>
my mind. The consent of the individual in all matters is its core ethic, and one
<BR>
that I think that extropy shares. Any philosophy that shares that ethic as well
<BR>
can peacefully co-exist and co-operate with libertarians and a libertarian
<BR>
society. If you can accept that, then you really should not have any trouble
<BR>
with extropy OR libertarianism. 
<BR>
<P>You talk of your problems with implementation of libertarianism, but you have
<BR>
not stated what your problems are with such implementation. Do you think that
<BR>
people should be allowed to force others to do what they do not wish to do? Do
<BR>
you mistakenly think that libertarians would initiate force to make others live
<BR>
as libertarians wish to? Please explain....
