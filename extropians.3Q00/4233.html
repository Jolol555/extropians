<EM>&gt;  &gt; That said, how many on this list see planetary colonization is
</EM><BR>
necessary or
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; desireable?  I tend to think once we get to space, we should stay there
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are higher priorities, but given how little is being invested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into space development it should receive more funding.
</EM><BR>
<P>Given the potential for something to destroy the biosphere -- whether an
<BR>
asteroid hit, the Earth freezing over, or some human-made disaster
<BR>
(biological, nanotechnological, nuclear, etc.) -- and how much probability
<BR>
is assigned to this, some might disagree.  (I'm not among them, though I
<BR>
don't like having all the human eggs in one basket.:)
<BR>
<P>As for funding levels, I think funding is increasing in the private sector,
<BR>
especially after the successful Sea Launch launch.  (Unintended pun.:)  But
<BR>
investments have been on the upswing for the past decade anyhow.  I also
<BR>
think government space programs should be curbed and abolished.  This will
<BR>
encourage more private investment and the efficiencies that will make
<BR>
possible, but I don't want to start another thread on politics here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to (at least partial closure) self-rep automatic systems on the Moon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first. Most of the work for that can be done on Earth surface in space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulators, and hence require no cheap launch to LEO (but I still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think they shouldn't have killed Sanger).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the problem is NASA is a political beast and Mars is seen as its
<BR>
salvation by it.  Mars is portrayed as sexy, hence more Mars missions and
<BR>
little interest in the Moon.  That said, there are private groups looking
<BR>
into lunar exploration and exploitation.
<BR>
<P>I'm for doing stuff cheap and now, but since I don't have several million to
<BR>
throw around, I generally just do the same: talk.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
