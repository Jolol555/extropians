<P>&lt;&lt; Spudboy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am really confused.  How do you distinguish between a thug or 
<BR>
&nbsp;robber and a Capitalist.  By this token when I meet a jackroller on the 
<BR>
&nbsp;street demanding my wallet am I to tell the cops I was accosted by a 
<BR>
&nbsp;Capitalist?  Also should I ever meet Milton Friedman at a book signing 
<BR>
should 
<BR>
&nbsp;I compliment him for being the country's foremost advocate of thuggery?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually the only reason I call Nazism Socialist is that they sold 
<BR>
&nbsp;themselves that way and I am told delivered on many of the programs they 
<BR>
&nbsp;promised.  By that same token I define Facist as being a communist 
<BR>
derivative 
<BR>
&nbsp;because we know that Mussolini was a Communist party member and split with 
<BR>
&nbsp;the party only over a matter of election tactics.
<BR>
&nbsp;Ron H. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Ron, the real answer may be that a person can be many things. What if a 
<BR>
person is an excellent speaker, but is also a mass murderer? Its what people 
<BR>
do that counts, not merely how they present themselves. Perhaps a pianist, 
<BR>
who also sets schools on fire may be a more distinct case. In such cases, 
<BR>
most people would judge the crime, rather then ruminate over the pianists 
<BR>
musical talent. Milton Friedman is great, and so was Murray Rothbard. Better 
<BR>
to ask, is capitalism a means or an end in itself? Or are you saying that 
<BR>
capitalists don't do dangerous things to other people? Why not just judge the 
<BR>
capitalist or socialist by behavior-rather then public relations?
