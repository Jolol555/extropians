Robert, the Samuri of Darkness, wades in, his blades poised
<BR>
for action....
<BR>
<P>I would agree that The Pharoh situation is dicey, especially
<BR>
since I think they remove the brain in little pieces and
<BR>
stick it in a nearby urn someplace.  Egyption gods were
<BR>
apparently better at reanimation than we aspire to...
<BR>
<P>On the other hand the prehistoric man who got caught in the
<BR>
glacier in Switzerland might have been doable...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspended back then.   There is no environment for them to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfortable in, and it's probably infeasible to create one that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than trivially large (we could clearly decorate an apartment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriately).
</EM><BR>
<P>There is more than enough material in the solar system to give
<BR>
all of the Pharohs that ever lived realms equal to that they
<BR>
formerly commanded.  If we wait ~100 years before performing
<BR>
the reanimation I'm moderately confident we could give them
<BR>
each a pre-built &quot;real&quot; physical realm, likely it would have
<BR>
to be be a very large an O'Neal type colony or on a terraformed
<BR>
Mars.  If you reanimate him virtually (as an upload) then there
<BR>
is no problem giving him &quot;paradise&quot; at all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; b) We can't really communicate with our time-traveller very well. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snip] Culturally there is going to be a huge gap.
</EM><BR>
<P>If we reanimate *anyone* after the Singularity, there is going
<BR>
to be a huge gap, unless we go to the trouble of creating a
<BR>
virtual world (or colony) for late 20th/early-21st century life.
<BR>
Presumably the people undergoing cryonic suspension realize this
<BR>
and specify clauses to handle this in their reanimation directions.
<BR>
<P>Now, of course there are potentially interesting moral issues
<BR>
because we would be reanimating the Pharoh into an afterlife
<BR>
that is clearly contrived to suit his expectations and that
<BR>
was not one of his expectations (that Gods create afterlife
<BR>
universes to match the expectatiosn of those entering the
<BR>
afterlife).  But at the same time, if you are being reanimated
<BR>
and your expectations are being met, do you care who is pulling
<BR>
the strings?  Probably not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I meant to write about was a model suggesting that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspendees might be left suspended indefinitely (forever) because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevance (too ancient/different to be interesting) and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acculturation (too unfair to wake them into the modern world).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like mummies in a museum.   
</EM><BR>
<P>I imagine that there are specificiations in some cryonics contracts
<BR>
that would prevent reanimation.  The first that comes to mind is
<BR>
&quot;Only [or Never] reanimate as an upload in a virtual world.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My expectation is that the oncoming singularity compresses history
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such that the changes from Kufu's time (2,500 BCE) to ours may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually look small compared to what our modern suspendees will face.
</EM><BR>
<P>Post-singularity without a transition reality environment, you
<BR>
are probably quite right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not presently able to imagine how improved technologies will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address this.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I've suggested some solutions.  If you aren't aware
<BR>
of the capacities we can expect to command, then you should
<BR>
read Anders paper on Jupiter Brains or my papers on Matrioshka
<BR>
Brains and planetary disassembly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The suspendees may uploaded instead of physically reanimaged,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then modified (note that this essentially has to be without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fully informed consent) so as to be able to function in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social world of the future.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are lots of people on the list more familiar with cryonics
<BR>
than myself.  Perhaps some of them could comment in more detail
<BR>
on the reanimation clauses they have discussed or specified themselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Strange stuff.  It wouldn't be a singularity if we could see the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other side.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good quote!
