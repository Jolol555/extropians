<EM>&gt;could we all now please make a combined effort, and

<EM>&gt;try to bring the list out of the current bad S/N regime?

<EM>&gt;This means less one-liners, me-too's, cocktail party chatter, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Pretty please?

<P>OK, I'll take a shot.
<BR>
<P>Under standard accounts, decisions are made by combining positions
<BR>
on values and beliefs about facts.  One considers all the possible
<BR>
relevant states of the world, and beliefs about facts are about how
<BR>
likely each state is given each action, while positions on values
<BR>
are about how much one would like each state compared to the others.
<BR>
<P>People on this list seem to disagree with those not here about many
<BR>
decisions, so it can make sense to ask: do those disagreements tend
<BR>
to be more about values, or more about facts?
<BR>
<P>If we mainly disagree due to differing opinions about the possible
<BR>
future paths of human technology, or about the effects of political
<BR>
interventions on economic progress, or about how happy people would
<BR>
feel if they modified themselves in various ways, then we are
<BR>
disagreeing mainly about facts.
<BR>
<P>If we mainly disagree due to our putting a larger weight on future
<BR>
consequences, or a large weight on being influential in whatever
<BR>
future comes, or to being less repelled by being highly modified,
<BR>
or to being less concerned about inequality or to biosphere losses,
<BR>
or to expecting more dramatic technological progress, then we are
<BR>
disagreeing mainly about values.
<BR>
<P>There is less scope for being &quot;right&quot; in disagreements about values.
<BR>
Once we understand what we want, and opponents decide they don't want
<BR>
that, there isn't that much more to say to them.  &quot;Advocacy&quot; then
<BR>
consists mostly in seeking out people who haven't considered the
<BR>
issue and getting them to pick sides.  And if there end up being
<BR>
lots more of them than of us, we may just lose big time.
<BR>
<P>There is more to say when we and opponents disagree about facts,
<BR>
because in that case we fundamentally share the same interests, and
<BR>
are just trying to deal with asymmetric information.  But in that
<BR>
case we should take very seriously the fact that others disagree
<BR>
with us.  Even if they haven't articulated their reasoning to our
<BR>
satisfaction, we have also failed to do so for them, and assuming
<BR>
they aren't stupid we have to realize that they may know things
<BR>
that show why we are wrong.
<BR>
<P>So which is it, do our disagreements with opponents tend to be more
<BR>
about values, or more about facts?
