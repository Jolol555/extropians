The summer cinema spectacular X-Men will be premeiring tonight in the USA. 
<BR>
Since Transhumanism is principally concerned with the human form being 
<BR>
enhanced; and Extropianism is concerned with survival of intelligence in the 
<BR>
Universe, one has to pick and choose (I believe) which is the most important. 
<BR>
Is it more important to develop artificial hearts or focus on if the universe 
<BR>
can be controlled. Both are broad philosophies, and the pursuit of both need 
<BR>
to be encouraged. Because some Italian fellow misrepresents what Tipler said 
<BR>
(allegedly), all you need to is refute the allegation. If there is an 
<BR>
ideological movement against you, then the tactic is refute and 
<BR>
counter-attack. For as surely as rain is wet, ideologues have their own 
<BR>
skeletons in the closet.

<P>&lt;&lt; Those are important questions! This because transhumanism is an ideology 
<BR>
&nbsp;with far reaching implications, a system building philosophy! With deep 
<BR>
&nbsp;implications also in the field of political theory, and ethics, this as 
<BR>
&nbsp;certain kinds of politics and ethics will work to the advantage of 
<BR>
&nbsp;transhumanism, and others certainly wont.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;If we don't care about these issues we are just playing a bit with 
<BR>
&nbsp;computers, or having dreamy discussions about physics. But these things are 
<BR>
&nbsp;not INHERENTLY transhumanist, they could be discussed otherwise. And if we 
<BR>
&nbsp;don't have the tools to bring forward the societal change most will soon get 
<BR>
&nbsp;disillusioned BECAUSE THEY RIGHTLY NOT FIND TRANSHUMANISM PRACTICAL, it's 
<BR>
&nbsp;just a pasttime. But with the right tools, right analysis, and right 
<BR>
&nbsp;arguments we can change the world to a society that fits our ideas better.
