<P><EM>&gt; I can attest from close personal experience that those

<P>Michael asked, Greg, &quot; why pick out exogenous ones for attention?&quot;.
<BR>
Now you both know why I asserted this qualification, i.e. to exclude
<BR>
from my analysis e.g. serotonin deficiency based disorders, especially 
<BR>
bipolar mood disorders whose etiology is neurological.
<BR>
<P>That is, my remarks were not directed to illnesses resulting from
<BR>
neurochemical defects.  I am not inclined to consider these or any
<BR>
other biochemical disorders as emotional illnesses. Yes, Michael, I
<BR>
am procrustean to the extent that I regard all psychological illness as
<BR>
exclusively psychogenic, e.g. those depressions which do not respond
<BR>
to lithium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and similar agents. It is as
<BR>
absurd to regard suicide as an immediate consequence of endogenous
<BR>
depression as it is to administer psychotherapy to an OBS patient
<BR>
with senile psychosis.
<BR>
<P>Finally, depression and suicide are weakly correlated but not
<BR>
coextensive. Suicide may, for example, proceed from a perfectly
<BR>
rational decision to terminate a life reduced to chronic, intolerable
<BR>
and incurable physical pain. Likewise note that the vast majority
<BR>
of cases of depression, whether symptomatic of neurochemical
<BR>
defects, situational reactions or psychoneuroses do not result in
<BR>
suicide.
