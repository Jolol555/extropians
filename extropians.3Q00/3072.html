<P><EM>&gt;The kid's name was Chris McCandless, as I recall. I found his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;story quite moving--he made some mistakes that appear stupid in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;retrospect, but I could picture myself making similar mistakes if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd been in his situation. (I wouldn't have made mistakes about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the plants, but then I've been studying wild &amp; cultivated plants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since I was 10 years old).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I believe the root of the plant in question WAS edible, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seeds were not. Chris had been eating the root of the plant all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;along; his metabolic problems started when the seeds ripened and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he began to eat them. There are a number of common garden plants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for which roots are edible but seeds and leaves are not--Irish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;potatoes and jicamas, for example.
</EM><BR>
<P>The sad truth is that he was just another cheechako who though he
<BR>
knew it all. He refused every attempt to help him, and warn him,
<BR>
because he &quot;knew&quot; better.
<BR>
<P>Another sad tale along with Jack London's &quot;To Light A Fire&quot; which
<BR>
I reread annually to remind myself that Mother Nature will let her
<BR>
most ardent admirer freeze to death without offering them so much
<BR>
as a match.
<BR>
<P>Some people may think I'm a bit silly for always having a survival
<BR>
kit with me, even in the middle of downtown Chicago, but I long ago
<BR>
learned the lesson, and am always prepared.
