<P>
ST. LOUIS (AP) - Monsanto announced it will give away free licenses to use
<BR>
its patented technology for so-called &quot;golden rice&quot; and other genetically
<BR>
engineered rice varieties that advocates say could save millions of Third
<BR>
World children.
<BR>
<P>The St. Louis biotechnology company made the announcement Thursday at a
<BR>
symposium in Chennai, India.
<BR>
<P>Along with the new licensing plan, Monsanto said Thursday it will release
<BR>
its rice genomic sequence database on a new Web site, www.rice-research.org.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We want to minimize the time and expenditure that might be associated with
<BR>
obtaining licenses needed to bring 'golden rice' to farmers and the people
<BR>
in dire need of this vitamin in developing countries,&quot; Monsanto Chief
<BR>
Executive Hendrik Vefaillie said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Golden rice,&quot; which is enriched with vitamin A that could save malnourished
<BR>
children from blindness or death, was developed by scientists in Switzerland
<BR>
and Germany. Critics of biotech crops say not enough is known about their
<BR>
safety or effect on the environment.
<BR>
<P>Scientists working on improving the rice will now be able to use any of
<BR>
Monsanto's biotechnology tools free of charge.
<BR>
<P>The company hopes the licensing plan will spur development of rice varieties
<BR>
with increased levels of vitamin A, more commonly known as beta carotene.
<BR>
<P>The modified rice is expected to provide nutritional benefits to those
<BR>
suffering from vitamin A deficiency-related diseases, including irreversible
<BR>
blindness found each year in hundreds of thousands of children. Adequate
<BR>
consumption also can reduce the number of deaths associated with infectious
<BR>
diseases, such as diarrhea and childhood measles, by improving the immune
<BR>
system.
<BR>
<P>Monsanto announced in April it had a draft sequence of a rice genome, the
<BR>
first crop genome to be described in such detail.
<BR>
<P>Monsanto is a subsidiary of New Jersey-based Pharmacia.
<BR>
<P>Rice is a relatively poor source of many essential nutrients, including
<BR>
vitamin A, but is the staple for half the world. An estimated 124 million
<BR>
children worldwide are deficient in vitamin A, including a quarter million
<BR>
in Southeast Asia who go blind each year because of the problem. Improved
<BR>
nutrition could prevent 1 million to 2 million deaths a year, scientists
<BR>
say.
<BR>
<P>Rice naturally produces its own beta carotene, but it is lost in the milling
<BR>
process. The biotech variety would have the beta carotene right in the
<BR>
endosperm, the part people eat. The beta carotene gives the golden rice
<BR>
grains a distinctive yellowish hue.
