I am counting on intelligent life from earth or from some other solar system 
<BR>
to eventually (billions-trillions -quadrillions of years)  alter reality in 
<BR>
just such a manner you have suggested below. I figure that intelligent life 
<BR>
is part of the mix, or it sure comes in handy if one (ontologically) wants 
<BR>
things fixed.

<P>&lt;&lt; It might turn out that we can blow up extra
<BR>
&nbsp;dimensions to macro-size, hence changing a lot of our physics, but
<BR>
&nbsp;that still leves most fundamentals the same. The question is if there
<BR>
&nbsp;is total freedom (somehow we can change the laws of physics to
<BR>
&nbsp;*chess*) or if there exists meta-rules which cannot be avoided (like a
<BR>
&nbsp;constitution or the 200 rule set in Nomic). For the moment it seems
<BR>
&nbsp;that the meta-rules are simple: no changes to the rules are allowed. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;But that is the problem - Tipler did say it *must* happen in his
<BR>
theory due to his Omega Point Boundary Condition. He doesn't want a
<BR>
contingent Omega that may appear if we play our cards right, but
<BR>
something that *will* occur (if his theory is right). Had he just
<BR>
settled for the contingent version everything wopuld have been fine.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>My response here is weak, however I do not see anyone arguing against the 
<BR>
Beckenstein Bound (Jacob Beckenstein) and Tipler did state in &quot;..Immortality&quot; 
<BR>
that he believed that if we didn't do things like invigourate the universe 
<BR>
with intelligent life (robot life) that we would be &quot;condemning ourselves and 
<BR>
our loved ones to eternal death.&quot; Also that if Earth species failed at this 
<BR>
some other specie would have to.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;No collapse, rather forced expansion. The particle horizons are due to
<BR>
the fact that accelerating expansion makes it harder and harder for
<BR>
light to reach us, it has to move against the expansion so to say. So
<BR>
if this scenario holds, eventually every particle will be separated
<BR>
from every other by a horizon.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>On this one you have me beat from the start. I cannot see how any galactic 
<BR>
spawning species of robot could ever successfully establish itself and 
<BR>
survive, over horizon-level expanses. My wimpy answer might be is to mumble 
<BR>
something about Brane theory, and how fantastically remote distances may 
<BR>
really be only millimeters away, mumble mumble..
