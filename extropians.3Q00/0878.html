<EM>&gt; &gt;  They need to wake up and realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  that they can't just create words and music and art--they actually do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  have to do some of the work of creating money themselves, and they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  to throw away the idiotic &quot;art for art's sake&quot; mentality that has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  keeping them enslaved for so long.

<EM>&gt; No, suits are enslaved, artists are free. You have it so backwards it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; funny!

<EM>&gt; We're doing what we want and getting paid.

<P>If you're doing what you want AND getting paid, then you HAVE done some of 
<BR>
the work of creating the money yourself. My favorite artist has an 
<BR>
incredibly low output, which I have to attribute to his truely awful 
<BR>
business sense. If he had ever successfully exploited any of his more 
<BR>
popular works, he would have the money to support himself while he does 
<BR>
his art. As it is, he keeps having to take side-jobs in order to make ends 
<BR>
meet.
