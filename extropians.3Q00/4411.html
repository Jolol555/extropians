<EM>&gt; Facts are things demonstrated to be true by repeated experiment and

<EM>&gt; beneficial to the individual. Your statment above is neither of these. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is merely an unproven opinion or conjecture. What would be a value would be

<P>I'm a Popperian falsificationist. To me, facts are predictive theories 
<BR>
about outcomes of experiments which have been tested and have so far 
<BR>
failed to be disproved. As far as I am concerned almost nothing matches 
<BR>
your criteria for a fact, since nothing non-trivial can be proven true, 
<BR>
and it is thus not a useful definition. 
<BR>
<P>This is another problem with Robin's question. He asks whether I think we 
<BR>
differ most from others on facts or on values. If I have to choose one, I 
<BR>
would say we differ most on fact, but I find it more useful to point out 
<BR>
that all of my communication difficulties with normals stem from clashes 
<BR>
of axioms. I try (of course I fail) not to treat untested theories as 
<BR>
facts. Most of the rest of the world is very happy to hold as facts the 
<BR>
existence of things like ESP, ufo's, the soul, and a host of other 
<BR>
subjects for which there is no evidence, and for which there are no 
<BR>
theories that can be tested.
