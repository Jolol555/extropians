<P>
I'm in the middle of genome analysis mode and get to spend
<BR>
the day looking at Medline articles (you're all jealous
<BR>
I know)...  I must say though, when you really get into
<BR>
the molecular machines that nature has devised, it is *really*
<BR>
cool.
<BR>
<P>At any rate, once in a while you run across a paper that makes
<BR>
you hit the side of your head and go &quot;duuuuhhh&quot;.  Here is one:
<BR>
<P>Oncogene 2000 Apr 13;19(16):1982-91, Gerbitz A, et al
<BR>
&quot;Retinoblastoma susceptibility protein, Rb, possesses multiple BRCT-Ws,
<BR>
BRCA1 carboxyl-terminus-related W regions with DNA break-binding activity&quot;
<BR>
<P>Abstract:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The BRCT region, the carboxyl-terminus of BRCA1 (the breast cancer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; susceptibility gene 1 product), is ubiquitous in several proteins
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that participate in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. We have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previously shown that the BRCT regions of TopBP1 (DNA topoisomerase II
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; binding protein 1) and BRCA1 bound DNA breaks. A BRCT-related region,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BRCT-W1, in the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could bind DNA fragments, independently of DNA sequences. Five BRCT-W
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regions were found in the Rb family. All BRCT-Ws of Rb bound DNA fragments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Electron microscopy and treatment with an exonuclease showed that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BRCT-Ws bound double-strand DNA breaks. Since some BRCTs are exceptional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common relating elements in tumor suppression, our findings reveal novel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aspects of the tumor suppression mechanism.
</EM><BR>
<P>For those of you that don't speak genome, I'll translate.  The bottom
<BR>
line is that the BRCA1 gene the Rb (retinoblastoma) tumor suppressor
<BR>
genes work by binding to DNA double strand breaks.   BRCA1 and Rb are
<BR>
found to be mutated in breast and retinal cancers respectively.  DNA
<BR>
double strand breaks are periodically caused by ionizing radation or
<BR>
sometimes oxidative lesions).  Presumably this either results in the
<BR>
activation of repair mechanisms and/or triggering apoptosis (cell death).
<BR>
I believe human cells have a tolerance level of several double strand
<BR>
breaks before they decide to commit suicide.  Presumably this is because
<BR>
if the cells have too many double strand breaks it can't figure out which
<BR>
ends are supposed to go back together.  One example of what happens when
<BR>
you put two chromosomes together improperly is Burkitt's lymphoma, when
<BR>
the c-myc on chromosome 8 gets mis-joined into chromosomes 2, 14 or 22 into
<BR>
various immunoglobulin genes that are normally &quot;on&quot; in white blood cells.
<BR>
The mis-regulated c-myc causes the cells to divide out of control.
<BR>
<P>Mutations in the BRCA1, Rb or some of the other genes with BRCT regions
<BR>
would allow the cells to accumulate double strand breaks and not
<BR>
undergo apoptosis.  In the face of normally operating rejoining
<BR>
mechanisms this is going to turn the genome in that cell into
<BR>
a huge jumbled mess.  For those of you speaking computerese, imagine
<BR>
what would happen if your virtual paging routines put the blocks
<BR>
being paged out back into random locations in the paging file.
<BR>
<P>The human strategy contrasts with that of Deinococcus radiodurans that can
<BR>
tolerate hundreds of double strand breaks and seems to be capable
<BR>
of properly knitting its genome back together.
<BR>
