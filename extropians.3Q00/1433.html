<EM>&gt; &gt; I define the difference between pirate and legitimate broadcasters, in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; absence of intellectual property laws, to be a matter of ethics, morals,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; personal integrity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Your definition of 'best at getting content to lots of people' would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tempered by what means of obtaining and delivering that content the ethics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the people (i.e. that of every individual you seek to deliver to) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accept. If the popular opinion of you is that your are a no good theif who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; steals the work of others, then a popular boycott of you is likely to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; limit the Q rating of your network, assuming of course that you can find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people to work for you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you suggesting that it wouldn't be illegal to re-broadcast your content,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it would be unethical?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, Because there are three types of people in this world: makers,
<BR>
takers, and fakers. Rebroadcasting work created by someone else without
<BR>
compensating them for it moves you into the second category of people
<BR>
(claiming it as your own would put you in the third). Naturally, all
<BR>
makers in this world look on the other two groups of people as the
<BR>
lowest scum on earth.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it's unethical behavior, then why would we remove the laws governing it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because its wrong to legislate morality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can't have it both ways-- you want it to be free content on one hand,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but then be able to call me thief if I use it on the other.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I want you to be free to make up your own mind if you are going to
<BR>
be a productive member of society or a leech, and not have the choice
<BR>
forced on you by jack booted thugs (or your fear of them). A good and
<BR>
ethical society can only arise when all members of that society are free
<BR>
to make their own choice to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and
<BR>
evil.... ;-) and live with the consequences to their reputation in
<BR>
society as a result of that choice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if people would be tempted to call me a thief (as I suspect they would!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is only further justification for my position.  Why make it legal to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a thief?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because libertarianism (and anarchism in general) demand non-initiation
<BR>
of violence. Such a society can only exist when all are free to chose to
<BR>
be ethical, and can only be dealt with by other individuals in that
<BR>
society in a non-violent way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Your inability to see through the smoke is obvious, but its the smoked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glasses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the shyster that is blocking your view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ok, look, we disagree, that much is clear.  In fact, I'd say we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamentally disagree.  I'm certain we find the other short sighted,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stubborn, naive... contentious even.  But I certainly don't attribute any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; malice or intent to decieve to your position.  But this is the second time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in as many days that the 'opposition' has questioned my moral integrity, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frankly I find it kind of weird.  My intellect is on display here and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may attack it at will, call me stupid if you must, but I'd like to politely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ask that we refrain from comments from the position of ethical superiority.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean, it's a little early for that, isn't it?
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand that you are trying to imagine the possibility of living in
<BR>
a new society under new rules, but have not thought them all out
<BR>
completely yet, your preexisting prejudices automatically assumes that
<BR>
it would a criminal and chaotic society. I suggest you read David
<BR>
Freeman's essays on libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism.
