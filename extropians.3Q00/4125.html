<EM>&gt; &gt;  Is it evil to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To be honest, sometimes, yes. Although evil is a big word, and highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subjective.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would instead suggest the term &quot;opportunistic.&quot; Like an infection that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wouldn't occur if the host was not weakened. If I go to you out desperation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and you use that as leverage, you can take advantage of me. This can be my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fault but it can also be can be manipulated in advance, by you, if you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough force, or power, so desperation is a manufactured tool used by large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powers against pre-weakened constituencies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is the meaning of the old union song &quot;I owe my soul to the company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;store&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Use the example of a drug addict who's dealer begins with free samples, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keeps raising the fix price but gives him credit (if he will steal or pimp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for him). Eventually he &quot;owns&quot; the addict.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or if I can isolate a person so that I pay his wages and I also control the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;price of his living costs, I can always keep him just a little bit behind, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he can't leave. I can extend credit to him. He would &quot;prefer that I did&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too. Otherwise what happenes? His family starves. This of course 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;presupposes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I am able to hog the market. In olden days small mining towns, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example, I can make my goods the only goods available by burning down his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buildings or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Suppose today I'd just need billions of dollars and a politician's ear.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Even simpler, if I just plain say I'll break your legs if you don't let me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take advantage of you, you might say &quot;OK, I'd prefer you to&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the case of the Chinese company for which I have worked for almost ten 
<BR>
years - while writing my soon to be released book, &quot;Working for the Enemy&quot; - 
<BR>
the policy in the early '90's, during the recession, was to continuously put 
<BR>
out ads requesting resumes and promising bright futures to employees.  They 
<BR>
got hundreds of resumes per week in response, and the company president 
<BR>
spent hours per day going through them.
<BR>
<P>Then he would hire some guy right out of school with a masters in electrical 
<BR>
engineering, tell him about all the wonderful opportunities, etc.  But 
<BR>
first, he had to learn the company and prove himself.  So he would be put to 
<BR>
the job of typing in orders from customers and be paid $6.50 per hour.  He 
<BR>
would also be expected to do extra work on his own time or on weekends - to 
<BR>
&quot;learn the job&quot; - and he would be pumped for any good ideas that he might 
<BR>
have on how to improve production, and if he had any skills like photography 
<BR>
or art, then he would be encouraged to employ them to create new ads or 
<BR>
graphics for marketing (on his own time, of course).
<BR>
<P>After three months of busting ass, he would be called in to the president's 
<BR>
office and - expecting his promised initial token $.50/hour raise - be told 
<BR>
by the president that his work was &quot;UNSATISFACTORY.&quot;  Then he would quit - 
<BR>
not getting any Unemployment Insurance benefits -and they would repeat the 
<BR>
process.  With a typical work crew of 12 to 14 in their U.S. office, which 
<BR>
included the president's family, his yes-man manager, and a &quot;permanent&quot; 
<BR>
Chinese worker in the repair dept., they went through about one hundred such 
<BR>
employees in about 7 years.
<BR>
<P>The position that if the person choses to go along with the situation then 
<BR>
it must be to his advantage ignores the rights to have a contract abided by. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The employees fulfilled their ends of their contracts - some of which were 
<BR>
in fact in writing.  The employer, knowing that the costs of recovering 
<BR>
damages thru the legal system by the employee were prohibitive, not to 
<BR>
mention the effects on potential future employment of having a such a suit 
<BR>
on their record, simply screwed one employee after another remorselessly - 
<BR>
and in fact quite gleefully - totally reneging on their end of the contract.
<BR>
<P>This particular attitude - that contracts are just an idea that may be 
<BR>
renegotiated at any point - is pretty much standard in Chinese business 
<BR>
ethics.  American companies do the same thing, to be sure, but not nearly as 
<BR>
often, and when they do, everyone considers it to be reprehensible.
<BR>
<P>This imposes major costs on the typical Chinese business, however.  The jobs 
<BR>
that were constantly turning over required a huge investment in constant 
<BR>
retraining, plus losses due to lack of experience, plus losses due to worker 
<BR>
sabotage when they learned the score, plus all the losses of the expertise 
<BR>
that a permanent happy worker could have contributed.  As Fukuyama points 
<BR>
out in &quot;Trust,&quot; however, Chinese social structure has been such that for a 
<BR>
couple thousand years it has been impossible to trust anyone outside of the 
<BR>
immediate family.  Thus, it is assumed that a non-family - and especially a 
<BR>
non-Chinese - employee cannot be trusted and it is not safe to keep them too 
<BR>
long anyway.
<BR>
<P>China, in particular, would benefit from a social contract that might 
<BR>
overcome some of these problems.
