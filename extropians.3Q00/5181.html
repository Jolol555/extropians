<EM>&gt; &gt; I was being 'orrible and flippant. But I had a point...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Firstly, all this &quot;mysticism&quot; stuff. Gag me with a spoon!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, if you insist.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>If I ever meet you in person, remind me to wear a suit of armour!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Special spiritual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insight, grokking the nature of reality; where does that really get you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Generally, a lot more integrated and peaceful.  Sometimes admittedly it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can leave you simply blissed out and rather silly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; feel like it does something positive, but I think it's really just
</EM><BR>
feelgood
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crud; I'd say you'd be hard pressed to show any measurable benefit of
</EM><BR>
such
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; epiphany.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wouldn't be so quick to toss out as &quot;crud&quot; some of the central visions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of human history.  Some of these visions have fueled lifes of great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; importance like those of some of the greatest scientists in history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of them have fueled (admittedly not always for the good) entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilizations.  Learn from this stuff.  Tap these energies if you can.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not all fluff.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, it has its place, sure. Personal &quot;mysticism&quot; or &quot;spirituality&quot; has a use
<BR>
as a source of inspiration, and as a motivator. I guess you need to get your
<BR>
ideas from somewhere. What I object to is the terminology, I guess. What
<BR>
does &quot;mysticism&quot; mean? What does &quot;spirituality&quot; mean? They remind me of
<BR>
words like &quot;natural&quot;; loaded with emotional content, but vague and
<BR>
undefinable. Semantically bankrupt?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It sounds suspiciously like the idea of psychedelic drugs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;expanding your consciousness&quot;. The idea appeals (at least under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; influence of them, as far as I recall), but it's pretty much meaningless
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any tangible context. In the end, this stuff is the enemy of rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought, basically by definition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you think then that rational thought is wholly and completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient for all occassions and purposes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I don't; rational thinking is not inspiration, and can never substitute
<BR>
for it. Well, maybe a more intelligent being can use rationality to do what
<BR>
a less intelligent being would have to use inspiration/intuition for, but
<BR>
the more intelligent being can still use inspiration to reach even further.
<BR>
But this is still in the context of, and entirely bounded by, rational
<BR>
thought. You can use inspiration to decide what to prove/test, but rational
<BR>
thought must do the proof/testing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Secondly, and more importantly; this idea of building God for ourselves
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; downright dangerous. The god meme has appeal; it's nice to believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there's a point to the universe, after all (delusional as that may be).
</EM><BR>
By
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; extension, when you decide there isn't a God (or a Sysop), then it can
</EM><BR>
seem
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like a good idea to make one, or become one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What the heck do you think building a Singularity is if not giving a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tremendous &quot;point&quot; to the Universe or at least to human history?   If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is no point then the only point is what we decide to make a point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of.  yes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh heh. This implies that the Singularity is under control. I think the
<BR>
idea of consciously building the Singularity is pretty reckless; we hope
<BR>
it'll be a &quot;good&quot; thing (in our relative moral codes; I doubt the Amish
<BR>
would agree, for example), but we can't actually demostrate this with any
<BR>
surety. It's blind faith.
<BR>
<P>Yes, the only point, the only purpose, is the one we make. We must, however,
<BR>
be careful about inflicting that purpose on others.
<BR>
<P>Actually, &quot;must&quot; is too strong a word; no one is compelling you to play
<BR>
nice. But if you go down that path, I think the gloves come off all round,
<BR>
and fair enough. In my subjective morality, anyhow.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What does that mean, though? If you are going to build a do-it-yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guardian (in the sense of Plato - it was Plato, wasn't it?) then I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that's bad news; the best outcome we can hope for is failure. It's also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bloody arrogant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If there is no God and mysticism is crud then in what context or in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reference to what set of (presumably) rationally defined values is it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;bloody arrogant&quot;?  Particularly if we are all the intelligent life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is (as far as we know) then it would be a great shame if we didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce something for all the bother.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Fair enough; the concept of arrogance is ungrounded. I guess I'm assuming
<BR>
some rules of conduct in the universe, along the lines of &quot;be excellent to
<BR>
each other, dudes&quot;. If not excellent, at least don't defecate all over each
<BR>
other. It goes along with relative morality; you need to adopt something
<BR>
about letting others do things their way, and expecting that they'll respect
<BR>
you doing things your way. Or else, I guess you can always have a big
<BR>
punch-up to see who's right, but it would seem rational to avoid that as a
<BR>
default behaviour.
<BR>
<P>Building something advanced and amazing, including an SI, is laudable! Of
<BR>
course! But aspiring to build the cosmic ref, who'll enforce &quot;be excellent
<BR>
to each other, dudes&quot; is arrogant, and dangerous. Who decides what this
<BR>
absolute &quot;be excellent&quot; is? And who will guard the guardian?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you are going to become one, you either envisage being such a
</EM><BR>
guardian,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or maybe raising everyone up to equal status. In the guardian case, the
</EM><BR>
same
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arguments apply as above. In the egalitarian case, where is godhood?
</EM><BR>
It's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more powerful beings, sure, but a society of such. So the concept of God
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not useful in that context.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The concept of a world of abundance, a world where many of todays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; horrors are things of the past (although who knows about new horrors?) a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world where death is a thing of dim memory and the cosmos opens up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before our expanded sentience is quite compelling and is as much of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;heaven on earth&quot; as anything in any scripture.
</EM><BR>
<P>All these goals are laudable, I fully support them. However, linking them to
<BR>
concepts of &quot;heaven&quot; or paradise has a couple of problems. Firstly, it
<BR>
underestimates the desires of humanity, which are usually relative to what
<BR>
we already have; any finite heaven on earth is just going to seem like
<BR>
boring old, everyday earth in quick order. Secondly, linking these (quite
<BR>
earthly) goals to religious/spiritual concepts plays to the more dogmatic
<BR>
tendencies of transhumanism/extropianism; the side of us which is less about
<BR>
discovery and rational investigation, and more like a millenarian cult. It's
<BR>
an aspect that we ought to struggle against, to retain credibility and
<BR>
usefulness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Godhood is a relative thing in such a case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  As minds merge and become ever more powerful I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect you reach a Singularity of such dimensions that the result will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfy any and all non-contradictory tests of God-hood that can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devised.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>We are not going to be Gods. We may just end up as beings who are pretty
<BR>
damned powerful when compared to present day humans, but we will still be
<BR>
fallible physical creatures, made of atoms. Imagining godhood can only bring
<BR>
bad things, in my opinion.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Basically, the concept of God is all about authority, control,
</EM><BR>
dominance.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The ideas of benign rule, divine right, perfection. If you have any kind
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individualist streak, these are anathema.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is one view of God is about.  It is certainly not universal, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even among the world's major religions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, not formally, anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Gods will not help us where we are going. But they could seriously stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; things up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So you're not objecting so much because you thing a god is impossible as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because you think it would be a singularly bad thing (tm) if/when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manage to create one?  cool.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, because we will not be creating a God (whatever that is), no matter how
<BR>
much we wish it were so. It'll just be another creature, made of atoms,
<BR>
trying to find it's way (and it's lunch) in the universe.
