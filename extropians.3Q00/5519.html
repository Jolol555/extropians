Emlyn wrote, regarding Robin's challenge:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, the rules stipulate that the person can never find out about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me. So, I can only assume that whoever is running the competition is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do something rather frightful to me, to enforce that rule, because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know I'm going to try to violate it (I've posted it in a public forum after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you're over-analyzing the situation.  There is no presumption
<BR>
that someone will put out a contract on you.  Simpler to assume that
<BR>
the recipient has no basis for believing your claim.
<BR>
<P>The point is, do you favor or oppose someone else's good luck, if it
<BR>
is a net benefit to the group as a whole.
