<EM>&gt;&gt; This is probably still true, but Linux is getting much easier to install

<EM>&gt;&gt; have been incredible. That said though - I wouldn't wish Windows on the

<EM>&gt;&gt; average Windows user either.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;WHich is bogus. While I got my start with computers as a kid, I stopped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;using them for many years until I left the USAF. At that point was when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Windows 2.0 was out, and 3.0 was coming out. Installing Windows 3.1 on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virgin machine was very easy, and every windows install since then has

<EM>&gt;been easier.

<P>Sure, I never claimed there was anything particularly difficult about
<BR>
installing Windows. I'm sure you'd have no trouble installing any of the
<BR>
recent Linux distributions either, it's about as effortless as the process,
<BR>
by it's nature, can reasonably be. That's true whether you paid $5 at
<BR>
cheapbytes or $45 for a box and a manual. 
<BR>
<P>Installation is a strawman anyway: The non-technical PC user buys a machine
<BR>
with something installed, and there it stays till a techy friend upgrades it or
<BR>
the machine dies. Windows is almost certainly easier for the non-technical user
<BR>
to work with than Linux, at this point, but I think you'd be amazed if you took
<BR>
a look at what KDE and GNOME have accomplished.
