Space Tourism Expo 2001 - Announcement
<BR>
Pasadena Convention Center on the Labor Day holiday, 
<BR>
August 31 to September 3, 2001.
<BR>
<P>Space Renaissance, Inc. (SRI) is proud to announce the start
<BR>
of production of our second space tourism oriented show. Our
<BR>
first, Space Fair 1998 at the Queen Mary in Long Beach, attracted
<BR>
exhibitors and sponsors such as Kodak, 
<BR>
Boeing, Apple Computer, NASA/JPL, the Challenger Center, and
<BR>
many others. Our Space Tourism Expo (ST Expo) will be a much
<BR>
larger and more diverse show incorporating new private enterprise
<BR>
space entrepreneurs, NASA and aerospace programs, and the entertainment
<BR>
and travel/tourism industries. This will be a fun and exciting
<BR>
adventure celebrating our future in space. We are securing 
<BR>
our location at the Pasadena Convention Center and the Labor
<BR>
Day holiday for the next five years. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The show will incorporate the family oriented fun of Space
<BR>
Fair with the excitement of the emerging industry of real space
<BR>
tourism and commercial space development. We are expecting over
<BR>
100 exhibitors and sponsors, two dozen seminars and educational
<BR>
programs, an awards banquet for “New Space Pioneers,” Space Cruise
<BR>
Simulation displays, robotic and space/future themed magic acts,
<BR>
an art show, music, kids programs, thrilling announcements, and
<BR>
<P>press conferences, and many other activities.
<BR>
<P>Ticket prices will be $15.00 for adults and $10.00 for kids under
<BR>
12 and senior citizens. A 10’ x 10’ exhibit booth will cost $1,000
<BR>
for the full four days plus drapes. A wide variety of sponsorships
<BR>
will be offered to 
<BR>
capitalize on the 50 million positive media impressions we plan
<BR>
to acquire leading up to and during the show.
<BR>
<P>To date we have permission to list over 25 companies, not-for-profit
<BR>
groups, and government agencies who have expressed interest in
<BR>
participating. We are conducting a survey of potential exhibitors
<BR>
and sponsors seeking to 
<BR>
know if you would be interested in participating and giving us
<BR>
permission to list you as such in our new brochure. We are seeking
<BR>
suggestions and new ideas which could be incorporated into the
<BR>
early planning and design of the 
<BR>
show. Please connect with us.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
