<EM>&gt;From: Anders Sandberg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20&gt;H%20ExI%20Advisor%20Ray%20Kurzweil%20in%20new%20BusinessWeek&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000708191601.97967.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;The problem seems to be that his description is very much a somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;passive &quot;this happens, and people react to it&quot;, instead of &quot;this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what people will/might do&quot;, which is a much more active view of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future. I think we should be careful when we discuss our ideas to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point out that they are not deterministic stuff that just happens, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they are a part of a larger process driven by human ingenuity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ambition and curiosity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not so sure that yours is the correct view.  When you have a large 
<BR>
enough pool of people exercizing their human ingenuity, ambition and 
<BR>
curiosity, it may be that, statistically, the eventual result is a foregone 
<BR>
conclusion.
<BR>
<P>It's admittedly very difficult to see it that way looking from this side of 
<BR>
the future.  But perhaps its easier to see looking from this side of the 
<BR>
past.  If Orville and Wilbur Wright had never been born, do you think that 
<BR>
there is any reasonable likelihood that humanity would not have discovered 
<BR>
and exploited aviation technology by now?  Similarly, its pretty plain to 
<BR>
see that regardless of any presently living individual's human ingenuity, 
<BR>
ambition and curiosity, technology is following an arc that's fairly easy to 
<BR>
trace.
<BR>
<P>Computers *will* get smaller and faster.  Bandwidth *will* increase.  Our 
<BR>
understanding of human intelligence (and therefore intelligence in general) 
<BR>
*will* get better.  Our ability manipulate matter at the molecular scale 
<BR>
*will* improve.  Our understanding of biological processes *will* deepen.  
<BR>
These are givens, they are virtual certainties.  Put all that together and 
<BR>
its not very hard to see where we're headed.
