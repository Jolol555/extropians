<EM>&gt; &gt; One problem is that not only government and

<EM>&gt; &gt; hoodlums, but everyone else, lives constantly in fear of the citizenry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I remember when I went into a jewelry store where the proprietor wore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a sidearm.  It was pretty scary knowing he could pull out his gun and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shoot me dead at any time.  I didn't go back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is an irrational fear.  When you walk down a sidewalk, any one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers passing by could turn their wheel and run you over.  And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens, with intent no less, relatively often.  Do you never leave the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; house?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For that matter, there are more than a few people walking around that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could kill you as quickly with their bare hands as they could with a gun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The intent of the individual has far more bearing on your personal safety
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than any tools they may have on their person.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just so. Does mister Finney refuse to travel in states with concealed carry
<BR>
right laws? Sounds like a phobia we are dealing with here...
<BR>
<P>A business owner is not in the habit of shooting his customers, Hal, and you
<BR>
ought to be intelligent enough to figure out that, and that the implied threat
<BR>
of his gun should only scare those with the intent to steal. Does this mean that
<BR>
you were planning on robbing him?
