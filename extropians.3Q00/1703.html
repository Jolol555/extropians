&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymorphisms at the

&nbsp;&nbsp;Werner locus: I. Newly identified
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;polymorphisms, ethnic variability of 1367Cy/Arg, and its

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Werner syndrome gene (WRN) encodes a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;novel helicase of 1,432 amino acids. Homozygous mutations, all of which
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;result in the truncation of the protein,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lead to Werner syndrome. However, little is known about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the role of WRN in &quot;normal&quot; aging. We have identified four
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;missense polymorphisms and four conservative polymorphsims
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in WRN gene. A single study showed that a polymorphism at amino acid 1367
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cys(TTG)/ Arg(CTG) is associated with a variation in risk of myocardial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;infarction among a Japanese population. The 1367 Cys/Arg
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;polymorphism was examined during aging in three different populations:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finnish, Mexican, and North American. The frequencies of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1367 Cys were higher than those of 1367 Arg in all the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;populations examined, though the frequencies varied among
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;populations. The frequency of the 1367 Arg
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;allele, thought to be protective against myocardial infarction in a Japanese
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;population, was approximately three times higher in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;North American and Finnish adult populations. When newborns and centenarians
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were compared within the Finnish population, no differences
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were observed in the proportions of 1367 Cys/Arg across age
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;groups. Within the Finnish population, we confirmed a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significant decrease of the APOE epsilon2 allele and an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increase in the epsilon4 allele in newborn infants compared
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with centenarians. Thus, unlike the APOE polymorphism,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no evidence of an association of this WRN
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;polymorphism with longevity.
