<EM>&gt;     Hardware and upload compilation will become cheap enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     profitably run uploads for lower than then-current wages when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     human labor is still highly valued (i.e., before strong AI),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     and substantially before most individuals can afford to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     non-destructively upload themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Given this premise, most first uploads would be corporate projects,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and such uploads would have a first-mover advantage in filling niches.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Either question the premise, question that the conclusion follows from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;premise, or accept the conclusion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert Bradbury responded:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Objection (1) is the statement &quot;will become cheap enough&quot;. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The question is *when* will the hardware and compilation become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cheap enough?.  Will the rate of advancement of those technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exceed the probable decline in augmented human labor costs?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If not, then the argument fails.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wages have been rising for centuries, and computer costs have been
<BR>
falling rapidly for decades.  The ability to augment humans should just
<BR>
make wages even higher, and most augmentations of humans should also
<BR>
be able to augment uploads.  How could you possibly think that wages
<BR>
would fall faster than computer costs without widespread uploads or AI?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;All you need is the greens convincing people that &quot;services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provided by *real* people&quot; are better&quot; and you are in a situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where the market demand for upload slave labor goes soft.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is crazy.  Why don't people solve other problems by just
<BR>
convincing everyone to prefer third world labor, rain forest labor,
<BR>
disabled labor, animal labor, or &quot;socialist&quot; labor?
<BR>
<P>Because people aren't that pliable.  They like goods and services,
<BR>
and don't care that much where they come from.  Racism or do-gooding
<BR>
can change things on a few margins, but when you can hire a human for
<BR>
$50K/yr, or an upload for $500/yr, all the green preaching in the world
<BR>
isn't going to hold back the tide.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you do a copyload with pre-nanotech, you have to have a high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;confidence level you can actually make it work before human labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gets cheap (because living gets cheap) in a post nanotech era.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I have no idea why you think human labor would get cheap
<BR>
as nanotech gets better, at least without uploads or AI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What good do 15,000 copies of 1 accountant do me?  You want copies that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;learn new skills *faster* than humans in a rapidly changing environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>If humans are paid a lot, you just have to be as good as them to be paid
<BR>
as much.  Faster might be better, but isn't necessary.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;... Does the economy rapidly flip over to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the point where corporations are negotiating deals like &quot;I'll trade you 4000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physicians and 3000 scriptwriters for 400 nanoengineers&quot;?  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The economic bottlenecks that develop because your copies cannot be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;utilized effectively are going to diminish their value.
</EM><BR>
<P>Rapid changes make more variance in human and upload wages, and place more
<BR>
of a premium on adaptability.  But I don't see the relevance of that here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Given the paths I see the technologies on, it seems like the development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of mednanotech for evoloading would arrive sufficiently near enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the development of an understanding for brain processes and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compilation of efficient hardware to execute copyloads, that you cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reduce the corporate risks of copyloading projects sufficiently to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;justify the expense.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you put $1B ov VC into copyloading while $10B is going into evoloading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... then I would say your statement is false.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then I understood you correctly yesterday when I said:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I think you've got unrealistic hopes (!) for a &quot;sudden transition&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If one day destructive uploading costs $100Bn, and the next day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-destructive uploading (&quot;evoload&quot;) costs $1000, then yes there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more prospect for equity in terms of filling market niches ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But if costs fall more gradually, ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I did anticipate this by saying &quot;substantially before&quot; in my premise.
