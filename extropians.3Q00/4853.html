<P><EM>&gt; Geez Spike, what is it with excel &amp; engineers? Some years back I used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work in a company with lots of engineers, supporting small systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Engineers, I discovered, love excel. At some point, the really keen ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discover Excel macros, and build systems, which grow until they become both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mission critical and entirely broken. That was a, ah, challenging job.
</EM><BR>
<P>A big roger on that.  Excel is an incredibly powerful tool, but it does
<BR>
invite bad programming habits and abuse.  Macros tend to grow in
<BR>
unintended ways.  I have many horror stories, but will give you just
<BR>
a couple of the good ones.
<BR>
<P>A number of years ago I was working in a conceptual design group.
<BR>
We had a very sophisticated fortran package that does top level
<BR>
design, but it was really more than we needed, and the guy who
<BR>
ran the thing had other stuff to do than fool with us.  Turns out he
<BR>
was busted for a security violation, Wen Ho Lee-like, only in this
<BR>
case he really was so enamored with his job, he just kept taking
<BR>
datafiles home until he had a ton of classified stuff in his home.
<BR>
<P>Then he got caught.  They investigated him for months and decided
<BR>
he was honest, just somewhat misguided.  No criminal investigation,
<BR>
but he was fired, which was a tremendous loss to the company.
<BR>
<P>I ended up developing a spreadsheet that did what his successor
<BR>
couldnt quite manage in a reasonable time.  It was a solid rocket
<BR>
modeller that took into account nozzle shapes, loads, atmospheric
<BR>
conditions, fuel, variable drag, yakkity yak and bla bla.  It has
<BR>
44 inputs, and will calculate how much, how far, etc.  It kept
<BR>
growing ever more sophisticated until it got to the point where it
<BR>
consistently produced answers very close to the real software.
<BR>
<P>Would you believe it, they are *still* using that spreadsheet to
<BR>
this day?  It is faster and more convenient than software that
<BR>
was designed right.  I have an even better story, but it must wait.
