<EM>&gt; 	Once we can upload we'll also be able to enlarge/share
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscious experience.  For example, imagine a brain being enhanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (including additional visual cortexes, auditory systems, tactile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; awareness cortexes...)  to not only have conscious knowledge of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feelings going on in you're physical body but also of what is going on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in another's body / brain / consciousness all integrated into one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjective awareness.  When having sex, for example, you experience all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sensations / awareness going on, not just half of them like we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited to today.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are talking about a much more sophisticated degree of understanding
<BR>
of brain function than would be necessary for a basic upload.  All you
<BR>
need to upload (in principle) is a good model of how the different kinds
<BR>
of neurons work, along with a detailed map showing how they interconnect
<BR>
and influence each other in a given brain.
<BR>
<P>However this level of understanding will tell you nothing about how
<BR>
to alter or share conscious experience.  An uploaded individual might
<BR>
make a good guinea pig for experiments that could lead to this kind of
<BR>
understanding, but it will undoubtedly be a long road.
<BR>
<P>BTW here's another legal conundrum.  If the minimum wage is $5.50 /
<BR>
hour, and an upload runs 1000 times faster than a normal human, then
<BR>
should he get $5,500 / hour minimum?
