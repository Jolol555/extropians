<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?%20(Was:%20Congratulations%20to%20Eli,Brian%20...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F79WanR0bBnm1u2mQPo00009a14@hotmail.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; One does not perform &quot;research&quot; in this area.  One gets it right the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; time.  One designs an AI that, because it is one's friend, can be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trusted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; recover from any mistakes made by the programmers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What about programming the SI does to itself?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If it's smart enough, then it won't make mistakes.  If it's not smart 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then it should be able to appreciate this fact, and help us add safeguards 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prevent itself from making mistakes that would interfere with its own 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;goals.
</EM><BR>
<P>That sounds like a very thin line of &quot;what-ifs.&quot;  If it's not smart enough 
<BR>
to self-program it &quot;should&quot; be smart enough to realize that fact?  And it 
<BR>
should be smart (or dumb) enough to trust us to build in constraints to keep 
<BR>
it from interfering with its own goals (as opposed to interfering with our 
<BR>
goals)?
<BR>
<P>You keep saying that we cannot predict the behavior of an intelligence who 
<BR>
has not evolved like us.  But you seem to think that if you are friendly to 
<BR>
it, it will be friendly to you.  Friendship and reciprocation are evolved 
<BR>
human social constructs.  You think you can engineer these signal human 
<BR>
characteristics without suggesting by implication their opposites?  You can 
<BR>
teach friendship, without teaching about enmity?  You can engineer 
<BR>
reciprocation, without suggesting cheating?
