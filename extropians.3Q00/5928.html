<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, there the William Gibson approach from Neuromancer, an

<EM>&gt; Good one, Brian. Of course this would make AIs want to avoid the shotgun blast,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and not really make them want to be friendly. Some people have theorized that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are friendly because people fear even more the consequences of being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfriendly.

<P>An excellent point. Negative reinforcement, whether physical or verbal, does
<BR>
work on kids, though it is needed less when positive is used as well. An AI
<BR>
should be bright enough to quickly self program itself in response to positive
<BR>
and negative stimuli. That is what parenting is all about: teaching your kids to
<BR>
be good people. One of the prime problems in todays world is that old cultural
<BR>
standards of parenting were tossed out by many with nothing else to replace them
<BR>
but half-witted muddle headed mushy ideas that did not evolve over time, and
<BR>
were typically found wanting. Without the extended family today, and with so
<BR>
many broken families today, there is little leadership by example for most kids
<BR>
to go by to learn it. Relying on on-the-job training without supervision for one
<BR>
of the most important jobs around is hardly the way to go about it. I would hope
<BR>
such an approach is not taken with AI.
