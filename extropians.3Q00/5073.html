<EM>&gt; Depends on what brand of fundie.  Seventh Day Adventists have a

<P>I've read/heard that on the news -- web and radio.
<BR>
<P>You also have to dig deeper.  I bet it has little to do with faith and a lot
<BR>
to do with socialization and perhaps some aspects of doctrine.  On the
<BR>
socialization part, I think it's been concluded in several studies that
<BR>
people who belong to social groups -- which would include churches -- live
<BR>
longer than those who do not on average.  I suspect part of it might be
<BR>
lower levels of depression and being monitored by other people.  (Perhaps if
<BR>
you're sick and alone, you might be more likely to get seriously sick.)  I
<BR>
also suspect it's just part of human nature to socialize so that, ceterus
<BR>
paribus, socializing is beneficial across the board.
<BR>
<P>On the doctrine part, if you believe you're saved and you are centered, I
<BR>
think you'll probably have less reason to be depressed about little things
<BR>
in life.  You might also channel bad stuff that happens to you more
<BR>
constructively.  These are, notably, psychological explanations, but I think
<BR>
this has an impact on biology (overall health, immune system function,
<BR>
etc.).  I bet, too, suicide rates are lower probably because depression
<BR>
rates are lower and because most of these religions tend to have a taboo
<BR>
against it.
<BR>
<P>None of this is really reason to adopt one of these faiths.  Only
<BR>
package-dealing would force one to do that.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
