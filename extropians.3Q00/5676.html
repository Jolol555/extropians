<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Capitalists have never:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; a) operated concentration camps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How about what was done to US citizens of Japanese ancestry during the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1940's?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Government did that, not capitalists.
</EM><BR>
<P>I happen to have a 1971 Playboy interview of Albert Speer, Hilter's second in
<BR>
command during WWII, after he was released from prison and had published his
<BR>
book _Inside the Third Reich_. He was quite clear that the Nazi's, contrary to
<BR>
what many leftists claim, were quite socialist, and planned on widespread
<BR>
socialist economic restructuring of the economy 'after the war', far beyond the
<BR>
industrial centralization he had overseen during the war. He also said that it
<BR>
was a common understanding among the high command that Naziism was very close to
<BR>
Communism, and that ex-communists often made the best Nazis.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; b) exterminated people they refused to do business with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How about US aid to military in places such as San Salvador, Mexico,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Guatemala?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Government did that, not capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Moreover, in those cases, it was the reverse: Those people refused to do
<BR>
business with the US, and stole from US capitalists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; c) exterminated anyone who looked at or talked badly about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; bosses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How about unruly slaves?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Capitalism does not enslave people. It pays them wages.
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite, the society of institutional slavery as an economic activity is a matter
<BR>
of oligopolism, not capitalizm.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; d) waged war against people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; etc etc etc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How about the USA/CSA war of the 1860's?  How about the &quot;war on drugs?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Capitalism markets drugs, it doesn't wage war against them. The Civil War was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about federalism not capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, harvesting machines that had recently come into vogue in the north were
<BR>
banned in many southern states because of its potential impact upon their
<BR>
'peculiar institution'. Lincoln called the harvester his 'secret weapon',
<BR>
because its widespread utilization freed up many young men from the farms so
<BR>
they could join the Union Army. Between the cotton gin and the harvester,
<BR>
slavery was economically doomed, which allowed the citizenry the ability to
<BR>
afford to live up to the values they had long aspired to, another demonstration
<BR>
of the economics of rights.
