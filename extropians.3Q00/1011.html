<BR>
<EM>&gt; Eversion is actually merely the democratic process, akin to voting out of
</EM><BR>
office
<BR>
<EM>&gt; (i.e. turning the inside out) politicians comfortable in their power. Its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typical that an area steeped in communist theory would see the democratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process as perpetuating oppression and fascism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Our (italian) democracy is still very chaotic, very polarized.
<BR>
But the communist-fascist game is over, in my opinion (and I hope so!).
<BR>
What I call *eversion* is a degeneration of democracy.
<BR>
A degeneration that (I realize) You, fortunately, do not know.
<BR>
Another kind of degeneration is the s.c. transformism. About 1/3 of
<BR>
parliamentarians have changed his party. But that's another story...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Where the Catholic establishment in EU countries, like many other
</EM><BR>
organized
<BR>
<EM>&gt; religions sees ideas like 'freedom of religion' to mean that they are free
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; force their religion on others, and any restraint on that freedom must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascism. Its a twist, much like how people view freedom of expression not
</EM><BR>
to mean &quot;I have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a right to my own opinions&quot;, but that  &quot;Everyone has a right to my
</EM><BR>
opinions&quot;.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the typical busybodiness that causes the encroachment of
</EM><BR>
government
<BR>
<EM>&gt; power, authoritarianism of any kind that thinks that leaving individuals
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their own devices is a violation of nature.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. But what is interesting (in my opionion) is precisely this:
<BR>
can extropic themes solve that problem? And how?
<BR>
That is to say: is extropism (also) a philosophy for a democratic freedom?
