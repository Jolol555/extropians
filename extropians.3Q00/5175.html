<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me that the problem is one of cooperation (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;enforcement&quot;) rather than raw intelligence.  The transhumanists show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up in the 1980s and have all these great ideas about how to defend the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world from grey goo, then the Singularitarians show up in the 1990s
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and have this great idea about bypassing the whole problem via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superintelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great idea, instead a death of thousands cuts you vanish in the maw of 
<BR>
the Behemoth. Gulp.
<BR>
<P>So, please tell me how you can predict the growth of the core over the
<BR>
many orders over orders of magnitude during it's explosion in
<BR>
complexity, guaranteeing it to follow the set of constraints XY at
<BR>
each step of the game, even if you don't know what the final result
<BR>
will look like. Don't tell me about nebulous goals &amp; Co, prove it.
<BR>
<P>(this says you can't tell what it will do if you make it)
<BR>
<P>Tell me how a piece of &quot;code&quot; during the bootstrap process and
<BR>
afterwards can formally predict what another piece of &quot;code&quot; will be
<BR>
do, in all contexts, under all circumstances. (Bypassing Goedel, no
<BR>
less. And recent footnotes to Goedel).
<BR>
<P>(this says the thing itself can't tell what it will do if it makes itself)
<BR>
<P>Tell me how a team of human programmers is supposed to break through
<BR>
the complexity bareer while building the seed AI without resorting to
<BR>
evolutionary algorithms. Show me the evidence that it can be done, or
<BR>
at least argue from the theoretical position.
<BR>
<P>(this says you can't make it in the way you want to make it)
<BR>
<P>Tell me how a single distributed monode can arbitrate synchronous
<BR>
events separated by light seconds, minutes, hours, years, megayears
<BR>
distances without having to resort to relativistic signalling.
<BR>
<P>(this says the thing is inefficient, or is not what you say it is)
<BR>
<P>If it's not single, tell me what other nodes will do with a node's
<BR>
decision they consider not kosher, and how they enforce it.
<BR>
<P>(ditto)
<BR>
<P>Tell me how the thing is guarded against spontaneous emergence of
<BR>
autoreplicators in its very fabric, and from invasion of alien
<BR>
autoreplicators from the outside.
<BR>
<P>(this says you can't stay in the metastable regime forever, even you
<BR>
&nbsp;somehow magickaly get there)
<BR>
<P>Tell me how many operations the thing will need to sample all possible
<BR>
trajectories on the behaviour of the society as a whole (sounds
<BR>
NP-complete to me), to pick the best of all possible worlds. (And will
<BR>
it mean that all of us will have to till our virtual gardens?)
<BR>
<P>(just how large is the damn thing, and how much resources will it
<BR>
&nbsp;leave us?)
<BR>
<P>What is the proposed temporal scope of the prediction horizont?
<BR>
Minutes? Hours? Years? 
<BR>
<P>(nonlinear systems are provably unpredictable)
<BR>
<P>How can you decide what the long-term impact of an event in the here
<BR>
and now is?
<BR>
<P>(this says you can't tell how a particular event will turn out in
<BR>
&nbsp;advance, assuming you could predict it, which you can't (see above))
<BR>
<P><P>There's more, but I'm finished for now. If you can argue all of above
<BR>
points convincingly (no handwaving please), I might start to consider
<BR>
that there's something more to your proposal than just hot air. So
<BR>
show us the money, instead of constantly pelting the list with many
<BR>
redundant descriptions of how wonderful the sysop will be. Frankly,
<BR>
I'm getting sick of it.
