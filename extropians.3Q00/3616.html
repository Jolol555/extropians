<P>
N - I had another couple ideas about beauty ...relating to advances in 
<BR>
biotech engineering technology and life extension ...conceptual factors
<BR>
part one:
<BR>
youth = beauty 
<BR>
the mythology of &quot;a short life&quot;
<BR>
<P>Will increased life span and/or immortality make old age attractive in new 
<BR>
ways?
<BR>
<P>For now, we are mostly interested in youth. A plain person can be famous as a 
<BR>
beauty (see any of the teen idols today) if they are just young enough.  
<BR>
Women (including myself) seem far more preoccupied with &quot;looking&quot; young than 
<BR>
men, at this time. Especially good looking ones. For youth is beauty.
<BR>
<P>Of course, this is because prime mating time is early twenties for both men 
<BR>
and women, and particularly in women. This is perhaps why elderly men are 
<BR>
allowed to have gray hair and jowls on TV while their co-host counterparts 
<BR>
have hairdressers and more facelift needs. Some men can still have babies 
<BR>
even in &quot;ugly&quot; decrepitude, if they can convince a woman young enough to 
<BR>
accept such a path.
<BR>
<P>Is this enough? No. Men still hate to look old, and so succumbing to the 
<BR>
embarrassing &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; syndrome associated with the dreaded male 
<BR>
passage out of the hard body youth image - resisting transforming into those 
<BR>
balding, secondary sexual male bellies and wrinkled, puffy faces they see in 
<BR>
the mirror. Hoping to look young, feel young again, people do comb-overs, 
<BR>
work out relentlessly, apply cosmetics, even buy sassy little convertibles 
<BR>
and young lovers, ever aspiring to regain that elusive youth. Proving to 
<BR>
ourselves that we still have some &quot;juice&quot;.\
<BR>
<P>Of course not everyone, for many age gracefully and/or resist aging in 
<BR>
sensible ways, taking care of themsleves and being lovely emotionally well 
<BR>
balanced people. Beauty is always inside anyway. The outside is merely a 
<BR>
reflection, is it not?
<BR>
<P>With biological tinkering allowing women the option of childbirth at later 
<BR>
and later in life, and men the option of staying at levels of endurance that 
<BR>
early youth fondly brings, the mating window will open, as will the career, 
<BR>
and the beauty window. Even today the strict ageist barriers are coming down 
<BR>
and sex symbols being harmonious with middle age, Nick Nolte and Lauren 
<BR>
Hutton for examples.
<BR>
<P>With the advent of longevity, perhaps youth (the power of longevity) will go 
<BR>
out of fashion. Perhaps enduring and mastering a long passing of time will be 
<BR>
seen as beauty, and the evidence of time - not hormone loss - but character, 
<BR>
wisdom, grace, knowledge and poise- will give one &quot;beauty&quot;...
<BR>
<P><P>20th centurions may become highly sought after individuals: ancient, rare, 
<BR>
complex and exotic, compared to the new crops of baby immortals who never had 
<BR>
to face dying, never knew what it was like.
