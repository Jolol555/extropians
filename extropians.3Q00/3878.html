<P>Eli,
<BR>
<P>You were on nightline a few days ago.  There was you, Al Gore and George =

Bush.  Gore called you a &quot;genius among the upcoming generation.&quot;  You =

to restore order...
<BR>
<P>You made a guest appearance on the show V.I.P. which stars Pamela =

Anderson as the head of a bodyguard agency.  Some renegade government =

protect you. =20
<BR>
<P>I just couldn't get over the torrid love scene you and Pamela had on the =

floor of the singularity institute!  The censors must have been asleep =

at the wheel!  I hear her husband Tommy Lee is stalking you now because =

of it... =20
<BR>
<P>Oh, and there was the ten hour long series by Ken Burns(of the acclaimed =

civil war series) who did your biography.  I held back the tears as the =

narrator's rich voice read your posts to the extro list with violin =

<P>And we must not forget the slender publication &quot;Eli, he's so sexy =

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But on a sad note I read the indepth article about you in the National =

Enquirer.  I didn't know you had a raging drug problem and had thrown =

punches at photographers.  Wait, I had you confused with Sean Penn for a =
<BR>
moment there...
<BR>
<P>You were in the Weekly World News though.  In fact you got there cover =

story.  It showed you getting married to a space alien.  I called them =

up and asked if the story were true. =20
<BR>
<P>The reporter laughed and said no, but that you told them for the =

original story that you were going to put the world on it's ear with =

what you called a singularity brought on by seed AI.  They decided to =

run with a story more likely for the public to believe...

<P>Lastly, there was your appearance on the Howard Stern show.  I think =

it's best you not remember that one.....
