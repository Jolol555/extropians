<P><EM>&gt; It would work in principle, provided in the meantime no AI grown by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionary algorithms emerges. (This is unlikely, because in 20-30
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years we should have molecular circuitry, and hence enough computing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performance to breed an AI from scratch, while augmentation will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made scarcely any headway in that time frame). Because of explosive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kinetics of the self-enhancing positive autofeedback process of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AI, the cyborg wannabees would be just as left in the dust as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unaugmented people.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems to argue in favor of cyborg technology, if we don't want to trust AI
<BR>
to be friendly.
<BR>
Augmented Cyborgs could monitor friendly space to detect runaway evolutionary
<BR>
algorithms.

<P>Westworld remembered:
<BR>
Two close friends decide to take a vacation together at Delos, a robot amusement
<BR>
park. Arriving, they go to Westworld, one of the three interactive robot
<BR>
populated environments available.
<BR>
In the Old West environment, they &quot;kill&quot; a bad guy, get into a bar room brawl,
<BR>
and even have sex with robo-hookers. Soon, however, the robots start to
<BR>
malfunction.
<BR>
When one of the friends is killed by a gunslinger robot, the other runs for his
<BR>
life. The surviving friend ultimately destroys the gunslinger robot.
