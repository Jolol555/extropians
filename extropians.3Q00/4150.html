<EM>&gt; I'll say it again: The opponents of science and reason are much better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organized, with a much more unified ideological framework than the disparate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; groups working toward a continuation of the goals of the Enlightenment.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real progressives don't get better organized and funded, there's an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing chance of a significant anti-technology and anti-science backlash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that could begin to have real impact on the kinds of timelines we've all come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to accept as more or less &quot;inevitable&quot;.  Folks like Kurzweil and Moravec are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasingly &quot;preaching to the choir&quot;, while others, like Joy and Rifkin, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crafting messages that reach far beyond core anti-progress constituencies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well funded and organized luddites perennially prevail over science and reason
<BR>
(nothing new there). Nevertheless, I doubt that any anti-science/technology
<BR>
backlash (which comes mainly from affluent and spoiled Western cultures) can
<BR>
delay the advance of Asian populations (Japan, China, etc.) which are working
<BR>
day and night to catch up and develop nano, biotech, and AI. In addition,
<BR>
government centers, whether national or international, can plainly see that
<BR>
whoever leads in these fields will have a balance of power in their favor. The
<BR>
luddites may rant and rave with their well funded organizations, but when it
<BR>
comes to taking real action, governments and corporations do what results in
<BR>
increasing their power base, and that means they rely on science and reason.
<BR>
Bottom line: luddites cannot effectively steer any ship of state.
