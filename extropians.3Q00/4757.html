<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i have to agree. after all, i've participated in discussing many
<BR>
&quot;idle&quot; concepts myself; like esoteric mathematics, i always felt finer
<BR>
distinctions will turn out to be useful in some unforseen way. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however, the question involved here -- distinguishing art from
<BR>
non-art -- is hellishly complex. do we define art based on whatever most
<BR>
people call art, or discover it through studying a finite number of
<BR>
&quot;established&quot; art works? perhaps we may design a definition for art to
<BR>
reap the most benefit -- but in what spheres of influence?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old theories of tolstoy and santayana come to mind ... but it
<BR>
seems new trends are always dead-set to shatter whatever commonality we
<BR>
have perceived so far. ultimately, perhaps art is a just a tautology --
<BR>
whatever we deem art ends up becoming art.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i don't pretend to be objective; explicitly or implicitly, i too
<BR>
operate under some set of criteria, distinguishing art from other phenomena.
<BR>
yet, it often seems that my tastes tend to run counter to the mainstream.
<BR>
extrapolating a few generations into the future (ignoring the obvious
<BR>
inconveniences of the singularity), i can picture a time when &quot;consensus&quot;
<BR>
works of art would seem decidedly un-artly to me. what recourse would i
<BR>
have then? like the lone sane man on a mad planet, would i declare that i
<BR>
alone knew what art is?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would not confuse art with design.  The shirt I'm wearing now -- a Perry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ellis short sleeve -- has a design I like on it.  In fact, it's one of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favorite shirts.  Yet I would not label it a work of art.  It is pleasing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my eyes and comfortable to wear, but it is not art.  I value it, yet I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not call it or classify it as art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the same token, there are things or works which I do classify as art,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I do not value or like.  Some of these art works I'm even repulsed by.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yet I still believe them to be art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You see, something can be art without being valued by someone.  Someone can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even agree something is art, yet not like it and not want to experience it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever again.  Someone can love something, yet know it is not art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps i implicitly (and subconsciously) operated under the
<BR>
association of art with intellectual status. nonetheless, if only for
<BR>
practical reasons, perhaps we'd do better to abandon the concept of &quot;art&quot;
<BR>
as we know it and just stick with personal taste. i know it may be
<BR>
intellectually lazy, but it's not obvious to me what we would lose by such
<BR>
a move.
