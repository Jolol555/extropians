<EM>&gt; &gt; I think you'll find that even if the government tried to force it on people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they'd have a clause exempting people who claim a  religious reason (much as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can get out of social security payments if your religion forbids it officially,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like the Amish.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps, but like credit cards, I can see a system evolving where only those with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implants will be given many privileges.  If you operate strictly with cash, it's nearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impossible now to rent a car, stay in a hotel, or have regular cell phone service.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, I can see various insurance companies giving discounts to those people willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be tracked in their automobiles.  In other words, privacy will be a pricey commodity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I will say this about it, I can only speak for myself.  I have no problems with implants
<BR>
per se or other modifications to one's own body cosmetic or not.  The ability to replace
<BR>
lost limbs with advanced prosthetics alone shows the good side of the science of modifying
<BR>
the body.  Maybe someday accident survivors might even grow their lost limbs back.
<BR>
<P>About implants in society, it is an economical and preferential change before people agree
<BR>
to many surgical implants.  For instance, on the Internet today, do people use the
<BR>
electronic gold and cybercash to buy things?  No, they use their credit card.  If your
<BR>
grocery store gave away free implants next week that gave a 25% discount on groceries,
<BR>
would you get one?  These are examples of what optional implants might do.
<BR>
<P>Implants that are not only &quot;cosmetic&quot; in that they affect the human body in direct ways are
<BR>
probably considered medical devices and thus doctor license rules apply to be able to
<BR>
surgically install implants, or for them otherwise to be &quot;non-prescription&quot;, as it were.
<BR>
<P>So, implants might be seen as dangerous.  For example, if many people got implants, for
<BR>
various reasons, it would not take long before that demand created varying suppliers of
<BR>
implants with various levels of technical quality and reliability not to mention what other
<BR>
health factors of its use might apply.  We've seen with breast implants that various
<BR>
methods were used, and some were faulty, so peoples' lives were damaged and there were
<BR>
lawsuits.  Heart regulators and other surgical implants such as pins and screws in bone
<BR>
operations are pretty regular, I am no doctor.
<BR>
<P>There are basically these types of implants:  cosmetic, medical (to strictly replace a body
<BR>
function), locality (an ID on the person), or performance enhancing or enabling.  There
<BR>
would be combinations of these types of implants.
<BR>
<P>The locality based implants (any word) are those we discuss in terms of Orwellian style
<BR>
chip implants with anything besides an anonymous identifier.  For example, some cattle are
<BR>
tagged with GPS devices, normally cosmetically enough in their ear.  Some people have put
<BR>
implants in their pets, and some might consider it for theselves or loved ones for various
<BR>
purposes, such as getting oneself directions and things like that.
<BR>
<P>Performance enabling or enhancing implants might accomplish many various purposes.
