<EM>&gt; -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay, this is a theoretical question that I'd like to ask without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting bogged down in politics. I'm using Napster and Gnutella as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convenient examples and not because I approve or disapprove of either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Gnutella--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         It's distributed and therefore robust. You cannot shut down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         gnutellanet by shutting down one, or ten, or a thousand servers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         However, you cannot do exhaustive searches on it. The content
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         you're looking for might be out there and yet not be guaranteed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         to show up on a search. Another disadvantage is that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         searches make inefficient use of bandwidth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2. Napster--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         It is exhaustive. For better or worse, you'll find every single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         instance of Michael_Jackson_Thriller.mp3 that anybody on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         network is serving. However, the server/s that store the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         content listings and corresponding locations of the content are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         all under the control of one company, which means they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         vulnerable to legal action, censorship, company-wide technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         failure, corporate abuse, and attack by hackers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, what about combining the best of the two? Decentralization and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exhaustive searching? Is it a logical impossibility, or is it merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that hasn't been done yet?
</EM><BR>
<P>Freenet does do this to some extent.  It is a decentralized network which
<BR>
can hold data.  Each data item has a name or &quot;key&quot; which controls where
<BR>
it ends up in the network.  If you know the name of a data item you can
<BR>
then fetch it, and your fetch request will be routed to the same place
<BR>
so that it finds the data.
<BR>
<P>Presently you have to know the exact name of the item, which makes it
<BR>
less useful for music where you might want to search just by artist,
<BR>
album, or part of a song name.  The Freenet team is working on providing
<BR>
a method for searches to work.  It will use a different approach than
<BR>
gnutella, similar to fuzzy logic.  However it will not be 100% reliable
<BR>
and will still have the problem that you will not be guaranteed to find
<BR>
all data items that are in the network.
<BR>
<P>A simple approach to combine decentralization and reliable searches is
<BR>
to simply have a large number of servers, each of which replicate the
<BR>
entire database (or a substantial fraction of it).  An example might be
<BR>
the PGP key server infrastructure, with a dozen or so key servers each
<BR>
holding PGP public keys, periodically exchanging data to make sure all
<BR>
are obsolete.  The DNS root servers use a similar concept.  These are
<BR>
not fully decentralized, but the basic idea could probably scale up to
<BR>
having on the order of 100 or even 1000 servers, which would make it
<BR>
difficult to shut them down one by one.
