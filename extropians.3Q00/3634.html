I've done a fair amount of desert hiking (including a solo hike across Joshua 
<BR>
Tree in late July without caches and in about 54 hours) and quite naturally 
<BR>
thought a good bit about equipment.  For clothing, I prefer army surplus 
<BR>
desert pants.  They fit loosely, have conveniently placed pockets, and tie 
<BR>
about the ankles to avoid snags on brush.  For shirts, I've purchased 
<BR>
light-colored, long-sleeved, buttoned shirts from a &quot;tall and big&quot; store.  
<BR>
It's more important to get cover from the sun than to expose your skin to the 
<BR>
air, and the loose fit allows pretty good circulation.  The buttons and long 
<BR>
sleeves allow you to regulate heat loss with the widely varying desert 
<BR>
temperatures, too.
<BR>
<P>I've experimented with a couple of hats, neither of which I rate as ideal.  
<BR>
The standard-issue army desert cap works OK, but has a fairly narrow brim 
<BR>
that won't protect you from sidelong light and reflected glare.  I thus 
<BR>
currently prefer a modified baseball-style cap.  I've ironed a dark, 
<BR>
glare-reducing patch to the underside of the bill and attached over the top a 
<BR>
sort of loose hood that drapes about the sides of my head and neck.  It's 
<BR>
white cotton; silk would work better.  The hat would also ideally have more 
<BR>
&quot;loft&quot; room to allow heat to rise off of my head.
<BR>
<P>A good backpack (and back) can easily manage 35 pounds.  The water goes 
<BR>
there, natch.  A fanny pack won't make much difference in poundage, though it 
<BR>
can prove convenient.  Pocket will do the same, though.

<EM>&gt;  15 miles today thinking about it.  First thing I need is a thobe, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of those flowing white thingies that the sheik-ey type Saudi
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Arabians wear in the desert.  Then I need to figure out a way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  carry about 30-35 pounds, but a simple backpack wont do, nor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a fanny pack, but maybe both together might be the ticket.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  figure I should be good for about 25-30 hrs or so.  My goal is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  traverse 100 km in that time.

<P>SoCal Extropians interested in desert hikes ought to email me privately.  
<BR>
I've got a kick-ass Joshua Tree hike mapped out that will go from the 
<BR>
Colorado Sonoran Desert, over the park's southern range through 
<BR>
high-elevation forests, and back down into the Mohave desert.  It'll take a 
<BR>
couple of cars to set up and two or three tough days to accomplish.
