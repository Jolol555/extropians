<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20True%20love%20may%20just%20be%20all%20in%20your%20head&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000708185657.65835.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, the interesting question is how long it will take before, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example, wealthy women are scanning prospective marriage candidates to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see if they're *really* in love or just after the money.  There could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an interesting business opportunity here if anyone wants to grab it.
</EM><BR>
<P>My bet is that there will never be any definite measurable state which 
<BR>
constitutes &quot;love.&quot;  Love, when broken down to its elementary particles, so 
<BR>
to speak, will probably consist of some variable combination of sexual 
<BR>
attraction, a practical sense of interpersonal compatibility, an 
<BR>
anticipation of another person's ability to meet our various needs and 
<BR>
pleasurable sensations trigged by the love-object's presence (such as 
<BR>
reminding the love-subject of enjoyable experiences, people, places and 
<BR>
things).
<BR>
<P>When these variables exist in sufficient quantity and combination that the 
<BR>
love-subject is motivated to commit to the love-object to the exclusion of 
<BR>
all other potential love-objects, then I think it is safe to say that the 
<BR>
love-subject is &quot;in love.&quot;  I highly doubt however that this will ever be an 
<BR>
objectively verifiable state.
<BR>
<P>But then again, what do I know?  I (a formerly avowed life-long bachelor) 
<BR>
met my wife while we were both down in Acapulco for a week's vacation, 
<BR>
immediately fell in love, convinced her to move to California and within 3 
<BR>
months we were married.  Love, as they say, is a many spendored thing.
