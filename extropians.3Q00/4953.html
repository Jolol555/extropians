<P>That explains my recent mental sluggishness a lot...I'm up to about 35,000 
<BR>
volumes.  Eugene spent &quot;several $100 just for shipping&quot; last time he moved; 
<BR>
I spent $700 or so just for the boxes to put the books in.  (After each move
<BR>
I keep the boxes for the next move; there's a 10-foot stack of flattened 
<BR>
boxes in a back room.)
<BR>
<P>While there's definite utility to on-line storage -- grepping through 
<BR>
my library! -- paper still wins out for a lot of purposes.  
<BR>
<P>Chief is the hedonistic, materialistic pleasure of going downstairs and
<BR>
being surrounded by *my* *own* library.  (Okay, I'm shallow.  At least I
<BR>
own up to it.)
<BR>
<P>OTOH, I had a flood last year, and lost 1000+ books.  OTOOH, I have 
<BR>
replacement cost insurance.  I figure I'll move on-line gradually,
<BR>
as the technology gets there.  Starting with journals, which are often
<BR>
already available on-line but more expensive than my typical acquisition 
<BR>
costs.
<BR>
<P>I'm more eager to migrate the 3000 videotapes to digital format.  While
<BR>
paper has some advantages over bits, tape has none.  VHS tapes make
<BR>
lossy copies, take up enormous space, have a short shelf-life, and there 
<BR>
are no good storage solutions for large collections.
<BR>
<P>Basically, I'm an information junkie.  I would read 300+ newsgroups a day
<BR>
if I had the time.  Even pruned to my bare minimum, I still get 1 MB of
<BR>
email a day.
<BR>
<P>Extrapolating current trends, when I get to be a Jupiter-sized brain, I
<BR>
imagine I'll need a star cluster just to store all the crap I've 
<BR>
accumulated.  Not even counting my collection of Keith Hensons....
