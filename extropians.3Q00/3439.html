<P>So?  Read what Neo Nazi groups say about Judaism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the very first question on the &quot;faq&quot;:
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;People should be free to believe whatever they want, including Scientology.
<BR>
What I have against CoS is its deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its
<BR>
members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its
<BR>
arrogance, its attack on free speech, its litigiousness, its harassment of
<BR>
its critics, its lack of concern for families,
<BR>
<P>***** its gross neglect and abuse of children ****, etc.
<BR>
<P>Hate is a destructive emotion, I strive to be constructive. My opposition to
<BR>
CoS is based on rational investigation of available information, not
<BR>
emotions.&quot; ?????!
<BR>
<P><P>Emphasis mine.  Note this is the same thing that has us up in arms when
<BR>
aimed at one of our own.
<BR>
<P>Apply the same standards to Scientology critics as you do to anything else
<BR>
(Say a speech by Jeremy Riftkin).
<BR>
<P>Once again... first, there is currently no proof that anybody associated
<BR>
with CoS had anything to do with the attack on Max, and second, by repeating
<BR>
hearsay (posting urls of obvious hate sites) you are as guilty as any
<BR>
religious bigots.
<BR>
<P>And, just to remind you where my loyalties lie...  I am an ex member of the
<BR>
CoS.  I have been declared a &quot;suppressive person&quot; by that organization and
<BR>
according to their accounting methods (any service received while on staff
<BR>
becomes payable in full if you don't complete your contract) I owe them over
<BR>
10,000 dollars.
<BR>
<P>Despite the (false) horror stories promulgated by CoS haters, I have not
<BR>
been harassed in any way by the CoS.
<BR>
<P>Lets be rational folks.
<BR>
<P>Loree Thomas
<BR>
<P>&quot;Scientology...  The new Jews.&quot;
