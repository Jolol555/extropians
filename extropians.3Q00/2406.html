<EM>&gt; &gt; [from a future history essay]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although this may seem unfashionable at the midpoint of the 21st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; century, I assure you that it is a practice that was quite popular up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until recently.  Indeed, until the end of the 20th century, it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible for people even in the most technologically advanced nations to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learn only a few basic facts about how the world worked, stop learning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at around age 18, and live full and productive lives.  Only the elite -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scientists, engineers, chief politicians and businessmen, and a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others - needed much more information to do their jobs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; THis is a pretty arrogant statement to make. The only people I know of who get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; by on only a high school education are burger flippers (and treating only formal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; accredited bachelor or higher programs as 'education beyond age 18' is even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; higher level of arrogance). A larger percent of people WITH four year degrees I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; regard as not only having sub-average intelligence, but pathetically low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; interest in 'how the world works', where I know many less formally educated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; people who are not only well versed, but give a damn. These are postmen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanics, sales people, etc. I, for example, am a college dropout. Everything I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; know about what I do for a living (computer consulting) I learned outside of ANY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; accredited program. I also happen to read the newspaper every day, front to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; back. I've got a better idea of what is going on in the world and how it works
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; than about 90% of the college grads I know (a large percent of whom work in jobs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that have absolutely nothing to do with what their degree is in, jobs that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; frequently have no degree requirement, like waiting tables.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ok...but I think you see the point I was trying to make here (that is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that 90% don't bother learning things beyond formal education).  Would it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; work if I replaced &quot;at around age 18&quot; with, say, &quot;by age 25&quot; or &quot;upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; entering the workforce full time&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, because, at least in this area, at least 1/4 to 1/2 of the people I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know obtain additional training after entering the workforce, on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuing basis. Those that don't are not doing so out of ignorance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but because its not NECCESSARY.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps I could phrase it better, so &quot;stop learning&quot; is more obviously
<BR>
&quot;stop learning about the world&quot;, but the latter phrase seems rather
<BR>
clunky in that context (since I just said &quot;how the world works&quot;, and I'd
<BR>
rather avoid repeating &quot;the world&quot; in such a short span).  Can you think
<BR>
of a better way to phrase it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even then, some people advocated lifelong learning as a path to a fuller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life, but this movement never really caught on until recently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; On the contrary, lifelong learning is a pretty popular path today. More people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; earn bachelors degrees after age 30 than before it today (similarly for masters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; degrees).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's *gaining* in popularity, true.  But from what I've seen, I wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; call it &quot;popular&quot; among society as a whole just yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nor does it need to be. A better question to put to people is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percent of their current jobs is dependent upon training they received
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in college and outside a degree program. I take extension courses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occasionally as the mood strikes. I am not interested in getting a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degree, which I regard to be little more than a union card.
</EM><BR>
<P>Err...why does it have to be &quot;in college&quot;, if we're going for non-degree
<BR>
education?  Some of the most useful education I've gotten has been
<BR>
completely outside of formal educational institutions.
<BR>
<P>BTW, since you're not commenting on the rest of the essay, does that mean
<BR>
you do not see ways that it could be improved?
