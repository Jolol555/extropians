<P><P><EM>&gt; Either that or he let his domain get hacked
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, Brian, here's the text version:
<BR>
<P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>What is the Singularity?   Some 10 to 140 years from now-depending on which
<BR>
computer scientist, futurist, or systems theorist you happen to agree with-human
<BR>
culture will enter the &quot;blowup&quot; phase of its million-year history of incessant
<BR>
exponential informational growth, involving a sharp &quot;transition&quot; to &quot;runaway
<BR>
complexity&quot; that will quickly create a future vastly different from present
<BR>
society. Some even say that this future will be &quot;entirely unintelligible&quot; to
<BR>
current-era humans - though we disagree.
<BR>
<P>Most importantly, arguments about the &quot;sigmoidal nature&quot; (&quot;S curves&quot;) of
<BR>
biological growth and the &quot;crash phases&quot; of growth in populations do not apply
<BR>
to information as an entity, because information is not matter dependent. It
<BR>
always figures out ever-more-clever ways to rearrange itself using less space,
<BR>
less energy, and less resources during evolution (just think of the history of
<BR>
computers, and you will understand that this applies to technological as well as
<BR>
biological evolution). Thus the evolution of information involves the continuous
<BR>
movement to new substrates, with emergent forms always exponentially increasing
<BR>
their information processing pace over the history of the Universe.
<BR>
<P>Vernor Vinge first used the word &quot;Singularity&quot; (a concept with analogous
<BR>
implications in physics and mathematics) to describe this phenomenon beginning
<BR>
in 1982, and in recent years the term been adopted by a growing number of
<BR>
Internet futurists.
<BR>
<P>Many estimates place the transition to the Singularity as early as 2020 to 2030.
<BR>
If they are right, this is definitely not an issue we can leave for future
<BR>
generations. It is our responsibility to understand, to plan for, and to manage
<BR>
these events as ethically as we can, and to educate our children on their
<BR>
significance.
<BR>
<P>The last 50 years have clearly shown exponentially increasing growth in the
<BR>
influence of information processing technologies on human society. The part of
<BR>
the story that is now becoming clear is that this growth must always continue to
<BR>
accelerate, due to Universal dynamics just beginning to be scientifically
<BR>
understood. Thus the Singularity will be the central theme of our lives in the
<BR>
21st century, and increasingly recognized in the public consciousness.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Just Who Is a Singularity Watcher?   A &quot;Singularity Watcher&quot; is not necessarily
<BR>
convinced (or happy!) that the Singularity is going to happen, but they also don
<BR>
't want to be caught off-guard by the wide-ranging social effects of
<BR>
ever-more-powerful changes in computation. Even if they anticipate that the
<BR>
Singularity speculation may be correct, they know that human beings do not
<BR>
easily model exponential change, and that we will need to work together closely
<BR>
to help each other understand the forces at work, and to make better personal
<BR>
and societal decisions as we manage the transition in the most moral manner
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P>Hence this list, whose aim is to do its own part to help us all educate
<BR>
ourselves on the relevant issues, as the winds of change continue to rush at us
<BR>
ever faster each day for the rest of our lives. Due to inherent Universal
<BR>
processes related to the nature of growth in complexity, computation, and
<BR>
information, ours is the first human generation that will soon be utterly,
<BR>
absolutely, and constantly overwhelmed by change. This list (and eventually,
<BR>
this site) will try to be one important tool to help you investigate those
<BR>
processes, and to provide balance and perspective as you navigate the storm.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>The Teacher Who Runs This Site   My name is John Smart, and I've been
<BR>
researching and writing about these issues full time for about a year now, and
<BR>
plan to continue to do so for the rest of my life. I also have a ten year
<BR>
background in private education, so I am very interested in educating the
<BR>
general public in these topics. So far, one book has been published on the
<BR>
coming Singularity, Damien Broderick's The Spike. I am currently writing a
<BR>
second book on this topic. This work is now nearing completion and will be
<BR>
published on this Website in Summer 2000. I'll bet you can't wait! :)
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Electronic Consciousness Will Lead to the Singularity   Human-independent
<BR>
computer evolution is one necessary precondition for the &quot;runaway positive
<BR>
feedback loop&quot; of the Singularity to emerge. We are well on the way to such an
<BR>
environment in computer hardware. Every new generation of computer chip
<BR>
(integrated circuit) since 1978 has been designed by computer software, with an
<BR>
ever-decreasing fraction of human effort involved in the design process. In
<BR>
software, the new sciences of Emergent Computation (Artificial Life, Genetic
<BR>
Algorithms, Neural Nets, Parallel Distributed Processing, Connectionist
<BR>
Modeling) have demonstrated since the early 1980's that self-organizing
<BR>
evolutionary computation can increase its own adaptive complexity entirely
<BR>
independent of human aid-when given adequate hardware space.
<BR>
<P>Both Ray Kurzweil (The Age of Spiritual Machines) and Hans Moravec (Robot) have
<BR>
recently written important books which indicate that by 2020 to 2030 we will
<BR>
have human-level hardware complexity, and sufficient silicon evolutionary space
<BR>
for Emergent Computation to develop higher-level mental functions, and
<BR>
eventually consciousness. What happens after that must be dramatic, as you can
<BR>
well imagine.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Understanding the Singularity is Profitable   In the period prior to the
<BR>
Singularity, certain human endeavors will experience sustained and unrelenting
<BR>
exponential productivity increases. Your capital investment in those areas will
<BR>
consistently outperform all other market sectors. Maintaining a good
<BR>
understanding of the motive forces causing this exponential growth, ways to
<BR>
measure productivity growth using theories of information, computation, and
<BR>
complexity, and identifying the technologies and companies at the center will
<BR>
powerfully affect the performance of your investment assets. Combining this
<BR>
knowledge with a sound and diversified long-term investment strategy will help
<BR>
secure your family's financial future.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>A Choice of Three Singularity-Related Mailing Lists   Please select one of the
<BR>
following three mailing lists if you would like to receive information on events
<BR>
relevant to improving your understanding of the approaching Singularity.
<BR>
<P>List 1: Major Singularity-Related Public Events (conferences, classes,
<BR>
meetings).
<BR>
(Avg. of 1 to 10 emailings per year, no more than 1 per month).
<BR>
<P>List 2: Major Singularity-Related News and Events.
<BR>
(Avg. of 5-20 emailings per year, no more than 2 per month).
<BR>
<P>List 3: Major and Some Minor Singularity-Related News and Events.
<BR>
(Avg. of 10-40 emailings per year, no more than 1 per week).
<BR>
Please enter your email address, city, and state, to receive info on local
<BR>
events.
<BR>
<P>You may unsubscribe by return email or switch to a different list at any time.
<BR>
Your email address will be kept confidential (unless you wish it to be shared
<BR>
with other community members) and never sold. The list's emphasis will be on
<BR>
news from any location, and events in North America (until we have more
<BR>
representatives). Regional and international Singularity Watch moderators warmly
<BR>
welcomed.

<BR>
<P>Brief Homework for You, the Singularity Student    At present there is only one
<BR>
book, Ray Kurzweil's, The Age of Spiritual Machines, that I'd like you to
<BR>
immediately purchase and read to educate yourself on the coming Singularity.
<BR>
<P>Overview and excerpts can be found here.
<BR>
<P>To buy this book at Amazon (approx. $12 paperback)
<BR>
For cheaper new books try Buy.com or A1books.com, for used books try
<BR>
bibliofind.com or Bookfinder.com
<BR>
<P>A convenient audiocassette version ($16) is also available.
<BR>
If you are a slow reader, as most of us are, I strongly recommend purchasing
<BR>
both the audio tape and paperback. Listen to the audio tape first, two times
<BR>
through in your car (please forgive Ray's unfortunate choice of a &quot;husky-voiced&quot;
<BR>
narrator), and then skim the book afterward, annotating as you go. This allows a
<BR>
redundant learning strategy that will greatly increase your retention, and also
<BR>
make navigating the 343-page book a pleasure. Consider sharing book and tape
<BR>
with friends to amortize the extra expense.
<BR>
<P>Finally, please get on this List, and let me sort through the daily avalanche of
<BR>
information to give you updates on key issues as they transpire. Please also
<BR>
send me emails of any Singularity-related news or events you think I should
<BR>
forward to our community.
<BR>
<P>I could give you more required homework, but then I wouldn't be doing my job,
<BR>
which is to educate you on these concepts in the most high-yield, time-efficient
<BR>
manner possible.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Optional Further Reading   Consider Vernor Vinge's brief (8 page) 1993 speech on
<BR>
the Singularity which began the rapid spread of discussion of these concepts:
<BR>
<P>Here is a review of Damien Broderick's &quot;The Spike&quot; the only book so far which is
<BR>
overtly about the Singularity. (Ray's book is implicitly about the Singularity,
<BR>
and I expect he will explicitly use this term in coming years). Damien's book is
<BR>
more of a survey than a thesis work, so if you are looking for a recent history
<BR>
and overview of these ideas, you might get his book. If you want a thesis on
<BR>
which of the various Singularity scenarios and mechanisms may be the most
<BR>
important, you'll get one from me this Summer, I promise.
<BR>
<P>Foresight.org, Transhumanism.com, Extropy.org and Edge.org are perhaps the top
<BR>
four nonspecialist communities that discuss the Singularity from their own
<BR>
philosophical perspectives, and a visit to those sites can be quite informative.
<BR>
<P>General Reading
<BR>
<P>Finally, if you want to go beyond the Kurzweil book to get a broader and deeper
<BR>
understanding of the recent cultural events leading us to the Singularity, here
<BR>
are seven more works to consider skimming, arranged in priority order (and
<BR>
online references, if you are time or budget limited).
<BR>
<P>Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic
<BR>
World, Kevin Kelly.
<BR>
This great book is online.
<BR>
<P>Beyond Humanity: Cyberevolution and Future Minds, Gregory Paul and Earl Cox.
<BR>
Sample chapter and reviews.
<BR>
<P>The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution, John Brockman.
<BR>
Available online.
<BR>
<P>Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, Robert Wright
<BR>
Reviews, excerpts and other articles.
<BR>
<P>The Global Brain: The Evolution of the Mass Mind, Howard Bloom
<BR>
The hardcover will be out in August 2000. A draft version is now available
<BR>
online as a series of chapters: I to XXI. First and last chapters are especially
<BR>
informative.
<BR>
<P>Last Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era, Christopher Dewdney
<BR>
Brief review.
<BR>
<P>How We Became Posthuman : Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and
<BR>
Informatics, N. Katherine Hayles
<BR>
Summary | Prologue
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semi-Technical Reading
<BR>
<P>Science is still a few years away from a theory of computation (a superset of
<BR>
physics, information theory, and complexity), that will outline and clarify what
<BR>
we are now observing-an apparently inevitable progression to runaway complexity.
<BR>
These four works all provide important examples of progress in this area. Skim
<BR>
them if you are so inclined.
<BR>
<P>The Evolutionary Trajectory: The Growth of Information in the History and Future
<BR>
of the Earth, Richard Coren
<BR>
Review - brief registration necessary
<BR>
<P>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity, John Holland
<BR>
Summary | Review
<BR>
<P>Emergence: From Chaos to Order, John Holland

<P>Quotes from Some Important Singularity Watchers
<BR>
<P>&quot;Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman
<BR>
intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Vernor Vinge, 1993
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From The Coming Technological Singularity
</EM><BR>
<P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&quot;Many physicists are attempting to derive a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) out of
<BR>
the Universe... This effort may be incomplete in that particles may merely be a
<BR>
reflection of the information-processing foundations of the Universe (but it is
<BR>
certainly not a waste of time because this research may help us figure out how
<BR>
the information-processing system works). In the end, we may not be able to
<BR>
completely understand the Universe, if it is ever possible to do so, until it is
<BR>
examined as a self-evolving and organizing information-processing machine, one
<BR>
that produces intelligent minds to examine itself with. In this view, a theory
<BR>
of consciousness may be consolidated with a theory of physics into a Grand
<BR>
Information Theory (GIT).&quot;
<BR>
<P>Gregory Paul &amp; Earl Cox, 1994
<BR>
<P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&quot;Natural selection is important, but it has not labored alone...
<BR>
self-organization is the root source of order. The order of the biological
<BR>
world, I have come to believe, is not merely tinkered, but arises naturally and
<BR>
spontaneously because of these principles of self-organization - laws of
<BR>
complexity that we are just beginning to uncover and understand... How do we use
<BR>
the information gleaned about the parts to build up a theory of the whole? The
<BR>
deep difficulty here lies in the fact that the complex whole may exhibit
<BR>
properties that are not readily explained by understanding the parts. The
<BR>
complex whole, in a completely nonmystical sense, can often exhibit collective
<BR>
properties, &quot;emergent&quot; features that are lawful in their own right.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Stuart Kauffman, 1995
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Technology is advancing 'exponentially' or faster. This means that the bulk of
<BR>
the change in knowledge and capacity needed to precipitate the Singularity will
<BR>
occur within the last year [or two] before the event. [Translation: most of us
<BR>
won't see it coming.]&quot;
<BR>
<P>Dan Clemmensen, 1996
<BR>
<P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&quot;We are brothers and sisters of our machines. Minds and tools have been
<BR>
sharpened against each other ever since a scavenger's stone fractured cleanly
<BR>
and the first cutting edge was held in a hunter's hand... All known systems that
<BR>
exhibit intelligent behavior rely on the communication of information-two people
<BR>
discussing a problem, exchanging less than 100 bits per second, or the
<BR>
unfathomable number of bits per second exchanged among the 100 billion neurons
<BR>
within an individual brain. Information does not imply intelligence, and
<BR>
communication does not imply consciousness. The implications go the other way.
<BR>
... all our [computer] networking protocols... are simply a way of allowing
<BR>
hundreds of millions of individual processors to tune selectively to each other'
<BR>
s signals, free of interference, as they wish.&quot;
<BR>
<P>George Dyson, 1997
<BR>
<P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&quot;The [biological] evolution we have experienced for 10 billion years is reaching
<BR>
a state beyond which it cannot proceed without a fundamental and radical change
<BR>
of direction, form, mechanism, and nature. [Due primarily to our ability to
<BR>
generate meaningful information much more readily than our biological forms can
<BR>
process it].&quot;
<BR>
<P>Richard Coren, 1998
<BR>
<P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&quot;Computers doubled in speed every three years at the beginning of the twentieth
<BR>
century, every two years in the 1950s and 1960s, and are now doubling in speed
<BR>
every twelve months. This trend will continue, with computers achieving the
<BR>
memory capacity and computing speed of the human brain by around the year 2020.
<BR>
...the fate of the Universe is a decision yet to be made, one which we [or
<BR>
perhaps more accurately, our electronic successors] will intelligently consider
<BR>
when the time is right.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Ray Kurzweil, 1999
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>What's Next for This Site   After publishing my forthcoming book I will expand
<BR>
this site to include web resources on understanding the Singularity, investing
<BR>
wisely given the emergent constraints which appear to make the Singularity an
<BR>
inevitable near-future event, ethical and social issues, and other important
<BR>
topics with regard to managing the coming transition. If you'd like to help
<BR>
develop this community, just email me and we'll find a place for you on the
<BR>
board of directors. Meanwhile, please tell your future-concerned friends to join
<BR>
this List.
<BR>
<P>That's it for now. I look forward to meeting you at future Singularity-Related
<BR>
Conferences, my friends. Please take care of yourselves and your loved ones and
<BR>
stay optimistic. The Universe appears to be unfolding as it should, and I think
<BR>
it's pretty special that we are here to witness the biggest changes that any
<BR>
humans will ever see. Get out your surfboards... It's a wonderful time to be
<BR>
alive!
