<BR>
death of real people, some of them quite close to me. - samantha  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Samantha,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are dead on.  In essence we seem to be saying &quot;Samantha you are not 
<BR>
worthy to defend yourself; but if some criminal or insane person decides to 
<BR>
injure you we will eventually probably catch them and punish them.  In the 
<BR>
meantime you are to be a sheep and be afraid to go ahead and live your life 
<BR>
as a free and responsible adult.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we have a nation of politicians that tell us to go 
<BR>
unprotected where they will only go behind a circle of armed men.  Can you 
<BR>
imagine the politician that would go into the worse neighborhoods of New York 
<BR>
or Chicago without a detail of bodyguards.  I was in Waterloo, Iowa for the 
<BR>
1980 Presidential Primaries staying in what was the best hotel in very law 
<BR>
abiding town.  The visiting candidates wouldn't even come out of their rooms 
<BR>
without protection.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry but I have to tell this.  A local guy, in that town, sued his wife 
<BR>
for a no fault divorce and moved in with his intended.  A year later just as 
<BR>
the divorce was becoming final and in the middle of the local primaries I met 
<BR>
his wife and began dating her.  He took exception to that and announced he 
<BR>
would &quot;chase us down.&quot;  That night I put her in her car in the hotel parking 
<BR>
lot.  (The hotel was also the locale of the most popular nightspot in town)  
<BR>
I noticed she was nervous and watching for him.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told her, &quot;Relax, Senator Kennedy is staying in the hotel and they even 
<BR>
have a rifleman on the roof.  If your ex even raises his voice around here he 
<BR>
will be face down in this parking lot before he knows what hit him.&quot;  All of 
<BR>
that was true.  It was like living in a prison.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my point is those same people want us to go undefended.
<BR>
