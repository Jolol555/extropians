<P><P><EM>&gt;  Unfortunately it could also be an illustration of the same philosophical

</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;PS: For the record, I think Tipler is a crack-pot along the lines of Rupert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sheldrake.
</EM><BR>
<P>I feel that I should jump in to defend Rupert (although I don't accept all
<BR>
of his morphogentic resonance ideas)
<BR>
since he has always been helpful to me, and is amongst those interviewed on
<BR>
the new MVT documentary
<BR>
regards phantoms and dream phenomena. He is not afraid of challenging the
<BR>
scientific mainstream ...
<BR>
and we must have mavericks and dissenters to shake science out of local
<BR>
minima and blanket conventionalism. Every new breakthrough *a priori* must
<BR>
contradict or stretch part of the conventionalist cannon, there are two many
<BR>
yes-men and band-Waggoner's in academia (see www.att.ac site for academic
<BR>
reform) and a huge shake-out is needed.
<BR>
<P>Since all the conventionalist knowledge can be represented on computers,
<BR>
what is the point in supporting all the mainstream academics who share the
<BR>
same views? It is only the Tipler/ Sheldrake types who are going to get us
<BR>
anywhere in the future (even if not these two individuals in particular).

<P>&lt;&lt; You can change the world a lot faster with a Singularity. Can you make an
<BR>
&nbsp;argument showing that it would be better to spend my time having political
<BR>
&nbsp;discussions, and generally &quot;working within the system&quot;, rather than
<BR>
&quot;playing
<BR>
&nbsp;a bit with computers&quot; as you so unbiasedly put it? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;That's assuming that Singularity actually arrives at the time and manner
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt;desire. It may take its own time for technical reasons. Certainly it may
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt;arrive all at once. Cool things like gestalt people with radio-telepathy
</EM><BR>
(as
<BR>
<EM>&gt;described by Freeman Dyson) might be a step along the road; rather then a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Vinge Explosion.
</EM><BR>
<P>This singularity thing sounds about as scientific as those Xians hoping for
<BR>
a &quot;rapture&quot; at the end of the last millennium. How much is it informed by
<BR>
Leibnitz Monodology, Descartes' discussions on the indivisibility of a point
<BR>
&amp; more specifically, Dee's hieroglyphic Monad?
<BR>
<P>Methinks that only the satisfaction of Leibnitz Law and solution of the
<BR>
mind-body problem (Schopenhauer's world knot) will explain consciousness
<BR>
(thus the rest of quanta questions in physics) and bring about philosophical
<BR>
and theological convergence around an agreed superior or &quot;true&quot; theoretical
<BR>
framework.
<BR>
<P>Picking up on the thread about what is distinctively trans/post-human ....
<BR>
and why the Italian businessman should bother with extropianism ...... I
<BR>
hold that MVT gives an intertheoretic reduction to the MB problem, and
<BR>
this <A HREF="http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm</A>  combined with the unconscious
<BR>
preconditioning to *change* by adopting a new affirmative &quot;after-human&quot;
<BR>
label gives us a greater chance of survival in the future than those who
<BR>
have less full information and are less flexible in their personal identity,
<BR>
and limited to their received human-been conditioning.
<BR>
