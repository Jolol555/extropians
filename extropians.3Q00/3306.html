<P>
Let me begin this reply with my first observation:  When making attacks in 
<BR>
a public forum, if one does not wish them to be perceived as a direct attack
<BR>
on someone, then one shoudl leave out pertinent personal details.  Especially
<BR>
names. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've been an observer and secret student of memetics and extropy related subjects for a while, admittedly from a more sociological than mathematical angle, and having been accepted as a member of this forum, there are a few questions I would like to pose.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then pose your questions, and leave the gratuitous personal details out of it,
<BR>
and youmight be taken more seriously.  I am at the edge of my own personal self
<BR>
control to remain at all civil to someone who would act as irresponsibly as you
<BR>
have in this post.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A similar misguided aplication of tolerance concerns violations against children. A child is by nature weaker than an adult, is however at the same time tomorrow's adult and therefore the future of humanity. Any violation against children therefore potentially disrupts evolution in a way that should no longer happen based on traits developed in humans. It is one thing for a lion to eat the pups of a rivalling male - but the fact of humans having transcended this need is part and parcel of their very humanity. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is my point? I know from personal research that several extropians or transhumanists are guilty of sexually abusing children ... as well. 
</EM><BR>
<P>And here we come to the crux of the problem withy our post, and apparently your
<BR>
entire outlook.  WHY did you feel the need to name a specific name, and then
<BR>
additionally to attempt to tar someone else, with a spurious linkage at best
<BR>
(... a friend...)?  What exactly are you trying to prove?  Attempting to claim
<BR>
the moral high ground, or a particular axe to grind?
<BR>
<P>While we're in the mood for full disclosure, why don't you tell us what your 
<BR>
particular PERSONAL gripe is with the people you named?  What is it that
<BR>
drives you to at worst defame the good name of somoene in public, and at best
<BR>
reveal tawdry detailsin such a way as to imply an inherent value judgement on 
<BR>
the part of the reader?  Your accusations are rather vague as well - We need
<BR>
not get into questions as to what you implied versus what may (or may not - 
<BR>
courts of the world are not infallible) have truly happened.
<BR>
<P>The ad hominem nature of this attack is unconscionable, and truth be told does
<BR>
absolutley nothing for your credibility.  As I asked previously, what is your
<BR>
bone of idsagreement, your personal agenda, which you have so conveniently 
<BR>
forgotten to mention in your effort to discredit possibly two wonderful minds?
<BR>
Is it political?  Academic?  A rivalry?
<BR>
<P>The accusations you make are serious indeed, and merely lodging those 
<BR>
accusations in a public forum gives them credence they shouldn't otherwise
<BR>
have.  Your attempt at social engineering shoudl be rejected, but given the
<BR>
permanent nature of internet communications (this post may be archived in one
<BR>
of thousands of locations, if not more, most beyond the reach of a proper
<BR>
defamationa nd expungement order) the damage is incalculable - and irrefutable.
<BR>
For example, I could alledge that not only you were a homosexual, but had 
<BR>
contracted HIV from a &quot;paid companion&quot; and knowingly passed it along to 
<BR>
acquaintances - Not that the former is bad, but it colors many people's 
<BR>
perceptions of you in a negative light.  Now, these allegations are very much
<BR>
unlikely to be true, but once I hit &quot;send&quot; this message is a matter of public
<BR>
record.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For obvious reasons as outlined above, I do not consider this to be their private business. But I have so far failed to see reactions or statements from any extropians on this subject, which I consider a moral omission. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any comments?
</EM><BR>
<P>A few, as outlined above.  And a couple more.  I do not feel it necessary nor
<BR>
even optimal to express my opinions of a private individual's actions in 
<BR>
public.  How I react and choose to interpret someone's actions is MY OWN 
<BR>
BUSINESS an not that of any other group, including associates of the person
<BR>
in question.  This public moralization is one of the memetic structures that
<BR>
should be stricken from society at large; its damage is incalculable.
<BR>
<P>As for my opinion in this case, since you so thoughtfully directly solicited 
<BR>
it:
<BR>
<P>You shoudl be ashamed of yourself.  Crusader, go home to your minister, your
<BR>
moral certitude, and your pettyminded moralism.  We have no need of blind 
<BR>
moralists here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please do not consider this post a flame, because it is not. 
</EM><BR>
<P>A rose by any other name still smells as sweet.  You have crafted here the 
<BR>
most odious kind of flame - and you try a disclaimer such as this?  When you
<BR>
mature enought o know what your own words mean, then you are welcome back.  I
<BR>
for one will be selecting to ignore any further messages from one whose 
<BR>
itroduction is drivel such as this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It is a factual - though critical -  inquiry, based on my sincere view that a subject's advance will be hampered by deficencies in credibility and trustworthyness of its exponents, and therefore deserves an honest answer. The future can not be approached without dealing with present issues that might bar the road to it.
</EM><BR>
<P>This would have been a non-issue, most likely, for some time if not ever, had 
<BR>
you simply showed a measure of restraint.  By making these allegations, you
<BR>
lend them a credence that is difficult if not impossible to overcome.  I am 
<BR>
brought to mind of Pat BUchannan's speech in 1992 to the Republican National
<BR>
Convention in Houston, TX.  His allusion to national guard members being used
<BR>
to save the elderly membres of a nursing home from the encroaching flames and
<BR>
&quot;looting gangs of black Los Angelinos bent on destruction&quot; is still cited 
<BR>
today as factual by many people, even though it has been widely refuted - by 
<BR>
the National Guard itself.
<BR>
<P>Either you truly wish ill upon extropianism and by extension upon 
<BR>
transhumanism, or you are truly ignorant of your actions ina  greater 
<BR>
socio-psychological context.  Either way, you are a fool.
<BR>
<P>And my apologies to others on this forum, who are used to a more civil kind
<BR>
of communicationf rom me.  I could not let this sort of accusation be left 
<BR>
without some kind of comment - especially bearing the mark of a &quot;sociologist&quot;.
<BR>
