<P>Survivor' Spin-Off May Involve Mir
<BR>
<P>MOSCOW (AP) - ``Survivor'' lovers, brace yourselves. The reality-TV game
<BR>
show rage may climax with the winning contestant in a spin-off series
<BR>
blasting off for a stay aboard Russia's Mir space  station.
<BR>
&nbsp;Mark Burnett, producer of the wildly successful ``Survivor'' 
<BR>
television series, has signed an agreement with the MirCorp investment
<BR>
group to develop a project at Russia's cosmonaut  training facility
<BR>
outside Moscow, Burnett's manager said Friday. The show, tentatively
<BR>
named ``Destination Mir,'' would track contestants as they endure
<BR>
rigorous training in preparation for a trip to the 14-year-old station.
<BR>
Russian training specialists would eliminate contestants who aren't up
<BR>
to the task, and the last one left would win a rocket ride to Mir.

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
