Michael,
<BR>
<P>Perhaps Eliezer was waxing poetic. It's his way.
<BR>
<P>But, seriously, if one is very depressed, it's probable that one's reasoning
<BR>
is compromised. That's the reason I think one shouldn't mess around with
<BR>
fixing severe mood problems on one's own.
<BR>
<P>You have no fixed frame of reference on which to base a judgement.  Your
<BR>
frame is liable to severely shift as the treatment alters your mood. And
<BR>
these treatments can put you on a mood roller-coaster. A competent &quot;other
<BR>
party&quot; should be involved.
<BR>
<P>I've seen reactions coming from people who have been treated with drugs that
<BR>
interfere with the serotonergic; gabaergic; and dopaminergic systems. Even
<BR>
under prescription and weekly outpatient monitoring, things all too often go
<BR>
tragically awry.
<BR>
<P>Uncontrollable violence (in extremely short flashes - in people you would
<BR>
never think would be prone to such things); exacerbation of depression with
<BR>
an hour or so of inadvertent withdrawal leading to determination to quietly
<BR>
commit suicide etc.
<BR>
<P>Lists like &quot;extropians&quot; are public media; so caveats should be tacked on to
<BR>
letters like Eliezer's - and, besides,  I really don't think Eliezer's
<BR>
semantic intent should be taken from the literal meaning of his words in
<BR>
that particular letter. It must be taken in the context of his writing style
<BR>
and his ideology. Both of which are matters of public record.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>cymm

<P><P><EM>&gt;That's not what Eliezer said. He said nothing about making an exception
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for &quot;clinical&quot; cases. And you shouldn't &quot;mess around&quot; with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*electricity*, for heaven's sake! That stuff can *kill* you in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*milliseconds*, you know.

<EM>&gt;&gt; Eliezer is right,

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If you're not clinically depressed (and preferably professionally

diagnosed
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; as such by a good psychiatrist); don't mess around with the serotonergic

<EM>&gt;&gt; the glutaminergic system (DXM) either...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I suppose you're free to mildly tweak the cholinergic system - you get

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;For those of you who may have joined the Extropians list recently, I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;just like to repeat my warning about tampering with the serotenergic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;systems:  It may reduce your intelligence, blunt your creative edge, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;otherwise screw up your mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;This warning based on personal experience, plus some post-facto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;rationalization and generalization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Besides, severe depression is good for you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Yours,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;Eliezer.
