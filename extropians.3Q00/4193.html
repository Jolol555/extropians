<EM>&gt; &gt; Comp systems actually work in practice.  Unemployment compensation

<EM>&gt;requires

<EM>&gt;recourse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If he quits because the boss is a sadistic jerk who spends every day

<EM>&gt; &gt; psychologically torturing him, he gets back none of the money he paid

<EM>&gt;in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Excuse me?  Paid IN?  The worker is paid OUT.  He's paid out and paid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out and paid out (and, more to the point, paid off) every two weeks on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;payday.  How shameful that he isn't paid out even more when he quits!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What is this world coming to?

Sorry, your class (or lack thereof) background is showing.  (As an aside, I 
<BR>
have deliberately put myself into positions of vulnerability just to find 
<BR>
out the truth, for most of my life, which meant taking blue collar jobs 
<BR>
(with a physics degree) on occasion.  I am always startled, however, when 
<BR>
someone who has never done anything like that comes up with responses 
<BR>
indicating complete ignorance.)
<BR>
<P>Basic economics: Whatever additional expenses are occasioned by employing 
<BR>
someone come out of their potential salary.  If expenses rise, then 
<BR>
employers consider other options, such as contracting out, replacing workers 
<BR>
with machinery, etc.  Thus, the unemployment insurance is ultimately paid by 
<BR>
the worker, since it is tied directly to his being employed.
<BR>
<P>But if he simply got the additional money, he could save it to create a 
<BR>
buffer or safety net so that he could afford to leave an unhuman situation, 
<BR>
even if he had no job immediately lined up.  Unemployment comp, however, 
<BR>
takes that money and then forces the worker to put up with just about 
<BR>
anything short of physical assault - and there have even been cases in which 
<BR>
employers have been excused of that - before he's allowed to quit and get a 
<BR>
portion (minus the bureacratic handling charge or course) of it doled back 
<BR>
to him.
<BR>
<P>While he's getting that weekly pittance, instead of simply being handed a 
<BR>
lump sum (which as a worker he would be too naturally irresponsible to use 
<BR>
properly - right) which he might use to buy a computer, start a small 
<BR>
business, or purchase transportation or schooling, he is closely monitored 
<BR>
by the experts at the employment development center.  If he decides to go to 
<BR>
school, for example, he risks losing his unemployment check.
<BR>
<P>He has to go on regular job interviews and has to justify to the nannies 
<BR>
back an the employment center why he didn't get or didn't accept an offer.  
<BR>
The fact that a job was totally undesirable is not an acceptable answer.  
<BR>
Strategies that might yield a really good position are often ruled out by 
<BR>
the very rules of the unemployment insurance structure.
<BR>
<P>Isn't it nice that we have such nice people to take our money from us at the 
<BR>
point of a nice gun and then use it to control where we can work?  Put 
<BR>
yourself mentally in that position for a moment and then try to tell me how 
<BR>
this system is for the worker.
