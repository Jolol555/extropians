<EM>&gt; It's interesting that the bad guys would find it more believable that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would use the stick and in some ways be more intimidated by that weapon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It makes sense though, because the gun is a much more binary weapon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (life or death) and doesn't allow for the degree of control that a stick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or club would.

<P>My friend and coworker Aleta Jackson once woke to discover that three
<BR>
people had broken into her apartment in the wee hours of the morning,
<BR>
and she grabbed one of the two weapons by her bed before responding. 
<BR>
For reasons she's still not sure of, she chose the sword instead of the
<BR>
M-1 (she's a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism).  The
<BR>
burglars were instantly cooperative and submissive, and were positively
<BR>
*glad* when the police arrived in the fullness of time to arrest them.
<BR>
<P>Laser sights on a handgun tend to make it a better persuader- seeing the
<BR>
spot on one's groin makes even the most aggressive attacker think twice,
<BR>
by making the promise &quot;I will maim you&quot; instead of &quot;I will kill you,&quot;
<BR>
introducing a shade of gray into the life or death equation.  The
<BR>
maiming potential of a sword is what gives it its psychological power,
<BR>
but Aleta was fortunate the perps did not have firearms.
