<P><EM>&gt;They didnt say how much it costs.  If reasonable, Ill take one.  Recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some time ago I bought up the notion of a group of volunteers who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are willing to have *every* aspect of their lives open to scrutiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by anyone.  Heres one application: testing the new human ID implants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Another is voice recognition and verification for purchases.  Ill do it!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Pick meeeeeeee!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Zero, you and I were among those who were advocating a more transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society.  This latest little girl who was kidnapped Thursday and was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recovered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yesterday could be the poster child for open society.  How about it, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parents?  Would you be in favor of ID implants for your kids?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am so convinced of the benefits of transparency, that I'd certainly 
<BR>
consider being one of the guinea pigs in order to get the ball rolling.  In 
<BR>
fact, a few weeks back I was seriously considering rigging up webcams 
<BR>
throughout the house and leaving them connected to the web 24/7.  Couldn't 
<BR>
convince the wife though (like me she likes to run around less than fully 
<BR>
clad).
<BR>
<P>So instead, I'll be setting up a cam in my office so she (or anyone else 
<BR>
who's interested) can watch me while I work :)  Still shopping for a webcam. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll let you know when its up and running.
