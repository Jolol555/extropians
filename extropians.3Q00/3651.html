<EM>&gt; What do you think it the fastest way to get from here to there -- there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being a world where the nanotechnology Singularity has happened?  (Is it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good to take the fastest route?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Speed is one concern.  Quality is another.  If you concentrate just on
<BR>
getting nanotech developed...well, a world that has dissolved into grey
<BR>
goo *does* have nanotech.
<BR>
<P>That being said, the sooner nanotech can be developed and gotten into
<BR>
the general public knowledge base, the less time any lone crazy or small
<BR>
group of people seeing the world as their enemy - i.e., just about the
<BR>
only type who would deliberately destroy the world - will have to
<BR>
develop nanotech on their own.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think we can choose paths where we go from simple stuff that works --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building a tugboat that floats as opposed to an ocean liner that sinks -- at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first and spreading that.  We might also try to use the market: build stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that targets areas that will pay a lot -- be financially profitable -- and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use not only those profits to produce more but also to attract other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investors (in terms of both money and skills; researchers invest their time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and talent, right?) to the field, ones that currently aren't involved.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is definitely one avenue worth pursuing, though in order to play
<BR>
the market, you'll have to be able to convince investors that you're
<BR>
close enough to something that will sell well - say, being able to mass
<BR>
produce reliable, useful, and commercially feasable quantum or molecular
<BR>
computers - that their investment will carry you the rest of the way.
<BR>
You'd also have to worry about competition, though if you will be doing
<BR>
much more extensive development than just repeating other peoples'
<BR>
experiments, patents may be able to help (this being exactly the kind of
<BR>
situation they were designed for).
<BR>
<P>I'm actually thinking of using this process myself, but in another field
<BR>
- cybernetics - where I think I may be able to more easily assemble the
<BR>
resources and develop the products needed to get a business going.  But
<BR>
the field choice is just due to my own circumstances; there are
<BR>
undoubtedly people who would personally find this easier for nano than
<BR>
for cyber.
