<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<BR>
Free PSA 95%improves prostate cancer diagnosis to 95% sensitivity
<BR>
<P>The August issue of the journal Urology published the results of a study
<BR>
demonstrating that the free PSA (prostate specific antigen) test is far
<BR>
more sensitive than the the PSA test in diagnosing cancer.  Prostate
<BR>
specific antigen is a protein found in the blood secreted by the
<BR>
epithelial cells of the prostate, including cancer cells.   High PSA
<BR>
levels indicate an abnormal condition of the prostate gland, which can be
<BR>
benign or malignant.  Physicians use specific age ranges for PSA values to
<BR>
aid in diagnosing cancer.  PSA readings that fall between 4 to 10 ng/mL
<BR>
are diagnostically uncertain and require a painful and expensive biopsy to
<BR>
confirm malignancy, yet 75% of men with PSAs in this range have benign
<BR>
biopsies. Several forms of PSA exist.  Most is complexed and the minority
<BR>
is unbound, or free PSA.
<BR>
<P>Determining PSA density is another method of diagnosing prostate cancer,
<BR>
but this requires an ultrasound to determine the volume of the prostate by
<BR>
which the PSA level is then divided.
<BR>
<P>The study included 773 men ages fifty through seventy-five whose PSA
<BR>
levels were between 4 and 10 mL and whose diagnosis was confirmed.  The
<BR>
patients then received PSA, free PSA and PSA density  tests.  Using the
<BR>
method of evaluating total PSA by age-specific PSA cutoffs missed an
<BR>
average of forty percent of all cancers in men over 60 years of age.  Free
<BR>
PSA measurements and PSA density provided a 95% detection rate.  The
<BR>
advantage of the free PSA test over PSA density is the unnecessity of an
<BR>
ultrasound.
<BR>
<P>Lead study author William J. Catalona, MD, of the Division of Urologic
<BR>
Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine commented, &quot;PSA is the
<BR>
best cancer tumor marker in all of medicine, but there is understandable
<BR>
pressure to improve its accuracy. This study shows that free PSA is the
<BR>
best available way to improve the accuracy of total PSA tests . . .
<BR>
Results of this study are significant because they show that free PSA
<BR>
tests can improve the accuracy of PSA tests and are more sensitive than
<BR>
age-specific reference ranges. They are as accurate as PSA density tests
<BR>
in the study, but less costly. Other studies have also shown that free PSA
<BR>
ratios can provide the bonus of telling patients and physicians how
<BR>
aggressive the cancer is.&quot;
<BR>
<P>PROTOCOLS
<BR>
<P>Prostate cancer overview
<BR>
<P>The Life Extension Foundation has developed an extensive array of
<BR>
integrated prostate cancer therapies based on published scientific
<BR>
findings and the clinical experience of practicing oncologists. This
<BR>
Overview should be read first by the patient and the physician, and then
<BR>
the appropriate protocol(s) referred to depending upon the stage of the
<BR>
disease and the therapies being considered.
<BR>
<P>Unlike most forms of cancer, early-stage prostate cancer is usually
<BR>
controllable with hormone (testosterone)-blocking therapy. The drugs used
<BR>
to contain early-stage prostate cancer are FDA-approved, yet only a small
<BR>
percentage of urologists are using hormone-blocking therapy properly in
<BR>
treating early-stage prostate cancer patients. The scientific literature
<BR>
indicates that radical prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate)
<BR>
and external beam radiation therapy fail to produce an acceptable
<BR>
percentage of long-term, disease-free survival. The severe long-term side
<BR>
effects of these conventional therapies (surgery and external-beam
<BR>
radiation) are well documented.
<BR>
<P>In lieu of radical surgery or external beam radiation, prostate cancer
<BR>
patients may want to consider the Life Extension Foundation's early-stage
<BR>
protocols that incorporate combined testosterone, 5-alpha-reductase, and
<BR>
prolactin inhibition for temporary control of most prostate cancers.
<BR>
Innovative natural therapies can be implemented upon the initiation of
<BR>
hormone-blocking drug therapies.
<BR>

<BR>
cancer.

<P><P>Prostate cancer adjuvant therapy
<BR>
By Stephen B. Strum, M.D., and Jonathan E. McDermed, Pharm.D
<BR>
<P>Dr. Strum is on the Life Extension Medical Advisory Board, and Dr.
<BR>
McDermed is from the Prostate Cancer Research Institute (PCRI) in Los
<BR>
Angeles, California. Drs. Strum and McDermed are proponents of a holistic
<BR>
medical strategy that combines peer-reviewed conventional scientific
<BR>
publications with new findings in the areas of nutrition and supportive
<BR>
care of the patient. Dr. Strum and his partner, Mark C. Scholz, M.D., have
<BR>
a medical practice (Healing Touch Oncology) in Marina del Rey, California,
<BR>
that cares for patients with prostate cancer (PC) or who are at high risk
<BR>
of having PC.
<BR>
<P>We have routinely employed natural therapies in our holistic approach to
<BR>
oncology and internal medicine disorders for almost 30 years. Such
<BR>
therapies are based on published peer-reviewed literature and not hearsay
<BR>
from individuals or companies that appear to be in the business of
<BR>
medicine.
<BR>
<P>We use the nutritional approaches during the preventive phase in men at
<BR>
risk for developing PC. We employ the same strategy during the initial use
<BR>
of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and during the off-phase of ADT for
<BR>
the purpose of slowing the growth rate of PC as much as possible. In
<BR>
patients with active PC, we take a more aggressive stance on the dosing of
<BR>
these agents and also suggest the use of additional agents that appear
<BR>
promising in their activity against PC. However, it is important to
<BR>
indicate that the rationale for the use of many of these adjuncts is based
<BR>
on studies involving human cell lines of PC grown in animal models,
<BR>
usually mice. Clinical studies in humans have either not been started or
<BR>
are in progress but are too preliminary to report at this time.
<BR>
<P>The inhibition of new blood vessel formation to block the growth and
<BR>
spread of PC is currently under investigation. Androgen deprivation
<BR>
therapy (ADT) is known to have this antiangiogenesis effect as well as
<BR>
genistein. Other agents that have an effect on cancer cell invasiveness
<BR>
include green tea polyphenols. Green and black tea are derived from the
<BR>
same plant, Camellia sinensis. However, only green tea is rich in the
<BR>
flavonol group of polyphenols known as catechins. The fermentation process
<BR>
used in making black tea destroys the biologically active polyphenols of
<BR>
the fresh leaf. The catechins as a group have significant free radical
<BR>
scavenging ability and are potent antioxidants.

<BR>
<P>Prostate cancer:  PSA parameter and heredity factors
<BR>
By Stephen B. Strum, MD, and Jonathan E McDermed, Pharm.D
<BR>
<P>Emphasis on the use of routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitoring
<BR>
starting annually at the age of 40 with PSA velocity and doubling time
<BR>
determinations as a standard part of PSA reporting will increase the
<BR>
number of men diagnosed earlier, with a lower tumor burden and cured with
<BR>
local modalities of treatment (Labrie et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,
<BR>
1995; Labrie et al., Urology, 1996). PSA testing with these enhancements
<BR>
should start earlier, at age 35, in men with a familial history of PC. In
<BR>
addition, the use of routine free/total PSA levels should increase our
<BR>
ability to diagnose PC earlier, since fractionation of PSA allows us to
<BR>
monitor the malignant-associated portion of PSA called complexed PSA.
<BR>
<P>As our standard, and ideally routine, approach to monitoring PSA and other
<BR>
biological expressions of tumor cell activity increases in use, the
<BR>
percentage of men cured with PC should increase as well. This is borne out
<BR>
in a recent report in which PC was detected in 22% (73/332) of men 50
<BR>
years or older whose PSA reading was between 2.6 and 4. All cancers
<BR>
detected in this setting were clinically localized. This study indicates
<BR>
that PSA readings greater than 2.6 and less than 4.0 may represent a 22%
<BR>
risk of PC (Catalona et al., JAMA, 1997). The use of a free PSA test would
<BR>
help determine which of these men whose PSA readings were greater than 2.6
<BR>
but less than 4.0 have a high probability of PC versus a low probability
<BR>
of PC. Such a test could reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in the
<BR>
low-risk subset and focus a need for more comprehensive biopsing in the
<BR>
high-risk subset.

<P><P>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<BR>
<P>Super Green Tea Extract
<BR>
<P>Green Tea has become one of the better documented nutrients for the
<BR>
prevention, and possibly the treatment of a wide range of lethal diseases.
<BR>
Some doctors are now using high doses of green tea as an adjuvant therapy
<BR>
in the treatment of cancer.
<BR>
<P>The botanical extract in Super Green tea has been concentrated and dual
<BR>
standardized to ensure the highest quality, consistency and biological
<BR>
activity. This advanced 95/35 extract contains 95% total polyphenols
<BR>
(332.6 mg per capsule) and 35% epigallocatechin gallate (122.5 mg per
<BR>
capsule).

<BR>
<P>PC Spes
<BR>
<P>At the recent annual meeting of the American Institute for Cancer
<BR>
Research, it was announced that the herbal combination in PC Spes has
<BR>
prostate tumor preventing effects in laboratory animals, as well as the
<BR>
ability to lower PSA in men. In another trial involving rats injected with
<BR>
prostate cancer cells, an extract of PC-SPES stopped 90% of tumor growth.
<BR>
<P>For thousands of years herbs have been used in combination. This formula
<BR>
was discovered and developed by the integration of modern science and
<BR>
ancient wisdom. This product is the result of nine years of research by
<BR>
numerous MD and PhD scientists.
<BR>
<P>Ingredients: chrysanthemum, isatis, licorice, lucid ganoderma,
<BR>
pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto, scute.

<BR>
<P>BLOOD TESTING
<BR>
The Cancer Profile
<BR>
<P>American Metabolic Laboratories' groundbreaking research has merged
<BR>
several tumor marker tests into a Cancer Profile. Dr. Schandl, the
<BR>
Laboratory Director, has tested thousands of patients with this profile,
<BR>
with accuracy greater than 90 percent. When a patient is actually being
<BR>
treated for cancer, these highly specialized tests are used to monitor the
<BR>
success (or ineffectiveness) of ongoing cancer therapies.
<BR>
<P>Just as intriguing are the predictive abilities of American Metabolic
<BR>
Laboratories' copyrighted Cancer Profile. The Cancer Profile or CA Profile
<BR>
can, in essence, predict the body's propensity to develop cancer years
<BR>
down the road.
<BR>
<P>The expression &quot;forewarned is forearmed&quot; is perhaps nowhere more critical
<BR>
than in regular examinations for cancer. While much has been accomplished
<BR>
in treating cancer, including the use of alternative and natural
<BR>
therapies, experts are unanimous that the earlier cancer is detected, the
<BR>
better chance any treatment has of being effective.
