<EM>&gt; No the planets are not in our solar system.  They are around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other stars within a couple of hundred light years.  I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are up to 50 planets and either 2 or 3 planetary systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lowest mass is slightly under Saturn (except maybe for those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbiting around the pulsar).  Orbits are mostly fairly eliptical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which to some extent is a selection effect (because large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jupiters with orbits close to the star will be discovered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first in these surveys).  To get Jupiters close to stars,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are likely to have had planetary billiards occuring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is likely to create more elliptical orbits. I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *hoping* as time goes by, we will get more circular orbits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If that doesn't occur, then opportunities for life are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to take a significant hit.
</EM><BR>
<P>The planets currently being found -- if that's what they indeed are -- and
<BR>
their orbits appear to radically different from what scientists expected
<BR>
other solar systems to be like.  Though not doubt this is due to a sampling
<BR>
error -- researchers are limited, for now, to finding planets in certain
<BR>
ways which bias the research toward finding large planets in eccentric
<BR>
orbits because these are the easiest to find -- I don't think anyone in the
<BR>
1970s or 1980s would have predicted these particular types of orbits would
<BR>
have been found at all.
<BR>
<P>What I'm leading up to here is the question of whether what has been found
<BR>
is typical.  Also, I'd like to know how these findings have affected
<BR>
theories of planetary formation and of solar system formatiom.  (My
<BR>
knowledge of such is mostly limited to reading some of the popular
<BR>
scientific publications (e.g., _American Scientist_) and some of the bigger
<BR>
journals (e.g., _Nature_).)  Have workers in these areas had to revise their
<BR>
theories in light of the data?
