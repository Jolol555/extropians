<P><EM>&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Jason Joel Thompson&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jasonjthompson@home.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Freedom%20of%20Digital%20Information&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000801072637.82657.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">jasonjthompson@home.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;If we decide we want to be able to protect something that comes out of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;own head, then we look for ways to do so.  You claim that encryption will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;only a minor annoyance in the future: if that's true, then we've got some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;big issues.  Being able to protect information is only going to become 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and more important.  I wonder if the &quot;information must be free&quot; advocates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;include personal data and private communications in their manifesto?
</EM><BR>
<P>This one does.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Do you think I'm going to put my -brain- online when any mad hacker kid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;come along and tinker with it?  &quot;Check it out doodz, I hacked Jupiter 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;K777 into a raving lunatic.  -And- he does my accounting!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well as with any technology, you have to take the good with the bad.  If you 
<BR>
plan to wait until there is an *absolutely* safe way to upload you brain 
<BR>
before you do so, I have a hunch you are going to be waiting a *VERY* long 
<BR>
time.  In the meantime, those who are willing to accept the risks of the 
<BR>
technology will inherit the substantial benefits that flow from it.  If you 
<BR>
are like me, some of your most personal, sensitive and private information 
<BR>
is stored somewhere on a computer with net access.  If you think that your 
<BR>
computer is impenetrably secure, you are deluding yourself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;If it becomes possible for me to easily read your mind would you advocate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;means of protecting -that- information?  Or would you shrug and say, &quot;it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;information!  It's like air!  I can't control it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Personally, I’d say spread the wealth.  If you learn how to read my mind, 
<BR>
rather than me demanding that you not do so, I’d rather persuade you to 
<BR>
teach me how to read your mind as well.  That way you have no advantage over 
<BR>
me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;My vision of a desirable future includes a fully networked frictionless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;information matrix and lots of secure nodes of (nearly?) absolute privacy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;In my opinion, the technology for protecting your personal information IS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;going to be possible-- I don't share the defeatist attitude expressed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I think the concept of -absolute- freedom is bunk... the concept of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;only exists in a world with barriers to freedom-- &quot;un&quot;freedom creates the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;value in &quot;freedom.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The above sounds oxymoronish to me.  “Frictionless information” and 
<BR>
“absolute privacy” seem to be at exact opposite ends of the spectrum to me.  
<BR>
If you can think of a way to pull *that* off you may well convince me.  But 
<BR>
I can’t even begin to imagine how you’d do it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Individuals should be empowered with the means to control their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;information, including the ability to release it into a frictionless 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;medium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and let it replicate indefinitely.  They should be able to make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;determination of what stays private and what becomes public.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here we agree.  I believe that any disclosure of personal information should 
<BR>
be (and will be) mostly voluntary.  I simply foresee a future where the 
<BR>
benefits of disclosure will so far outweigh the perceived benefits of 
<BR>
secrecy that people will eventually be as inclined to conceal their data as 
<BR>
they would be to hide from their employers the fact that they showed up for 
<BR>
work and did a great job during the last pay period.
<BR>
