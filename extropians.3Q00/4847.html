<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, this is an attempt to hold down the price of skilled

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;workers.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Worked on me... {8-[

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been wondering if high tech workers would begin to complain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Loud and long.  Many ironies present themselves.  For instance
<BR>
at Schlockheed, the average raise across the board has been
<BR>
about 4%, but the average starting pay for the new guys has
<BR>
been increasing by about 6% for a long time, consequently there
<BR>
is salary grade compression: the new guys straight outta school
<BR>
are being offered starting salaries equal to what I was making
<BR>
only 5 yrs ago.  If the trend continues, then soon the average
<BR>
new guy will be offered the average salary of a veteran. Problem
<BR>
is, that isnt enough; they still cant afford to live here on that.
<BR>
Meanwhile the veterans, who have owned a home for a long time,
<BR>
(and many own rental property on which they are making a
<BR>
brutal killing) live quite comfortably.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, several years ago Taxifornia passed a wonderful
<BR>
law called Prop 13, which keeps one's property taxes at no
<BR>
higher than 2% a year increase over what it was when the house
<BR>
was purchased, even if the property value goes up 10 or 15%
<BR>
a year.  consequently the property tax bill alone for the new
<BR>
guys is higher than my mortgage payment, and pity the blighter
<BR>
who hasta rent.  Weirdness results.
<BR>
<P>So then, is there any logical reason why the new guys cannot
<BR>
be offered the same as the veterans?  Ok, well, how about
<BR>
*more* than the veterans?  Why not?  If I quit, then reapply
<BR>
as a new guy, do I get the average starting salary then, which
<BR>
would be a raise?  What if the company bought up one of the
<BR>
local tract shack neighborhoods and offered to let the employees
<BR>
live there.  Could I rent my tract shack, then move into one of
<BR>
the company houses, and pocket the change?
<BR>
<P>Next is the prestige thing.  When I started my career, the average
<BR>
aerospace engineer earned more than the overall average for
<BR>
all engineers.  Now we earn less than average, and waaay less
<BR>
than average for engineers with comparable skills in this county.
<BR>
So, those engineers who were primarily motivated by money have
<BR>
left the field, and the company knows the ones left like what they
<BR>
do.  But that still makes it hard to recruit new talent, whose
<BR>
attitude is: eeeww, you are an aaaaaerospace engineer?  Pathetic.
<BR>
You should do something sexy, like bioinformatics or genetic
<BR>
engineering.
<BR>
<P>And thats hard to argue with.  I would probably do that if I
<BR>
were just starting right now, altho I have had one hell of a
<BR>
rewarding career, very fulfilling.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Never been there except to fly thru.  Hope to visit at least the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;museum of natural history there.  {8-]  spike

<EM>&gt; If you're ever coming to town let me know, I'll show you around...

<P>Thanks, Ill take ya up on that if I can.  spike
