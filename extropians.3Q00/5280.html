Engineering Humans Not So Super
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;WASHINGTON -- Attempting to change genes and create future generations of
<BR>
perfect, healthy human beings is dangerous, irresponsible and should not be
<BR>
permitted now, a panel of experts says in a report.
<BR>
<P>A committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in a
<BR>
report issued Monday, called for the creation of a public committee to
<BR>
monitor and oversee the increasingly sophisticated research into genetic
<BR>
modification.
<BR>
<P><P>Much of the current research is concentrating on modifying the genes to
<BR>
correct health problems in living humans. This is called somatic gene
<BR>
modification and involves changing the genes in existing mature cells.
<BR>
<P>But, the committee said, there is animal research in which there is an
<BR>
alteration of genes that affect future generations. This is called
<BR>
&quot;inheritable genetic modification,&quot; or IGM.
<BR>
<P>Applied to humans, IGM could, in theory, allow the production of &quot;designer
<BR>
children,&quot; or babies born with genes modified to make them, and future
<BR>
generations taller, more athletic, more beautiful or more intelligent. IGM
<BR>
could also be used to remove from a family lineage the genes that cause
<BR>
inherited diseases.
<BR>
<P>Dr. Theodore Friedmann of the University of California, San Diego, said that
<BR>
IGM technology now &quot;is not safe for humans.&quot;
<BR>
<P>He said experiments have produced animals born with major birth defects,
<BR>
gross physical distortions and fatal abnormalities. The same thing, he said,
<BR>
could happen in humans if the current IGM technology was applied.
<BR>
<P>Friedmann said reports of gene manipulation and cloning experiments tend to
<BR>
concentrate on the successes. But behind each triumph there can be scores of
<BR>
animals that were born with terrible and usually lethal genetic problems.
<BR>
This, the committee said, shows that the IGM research is not now safe to use
<BR>
on humans.
<BR>
<P>&quot;In animal experiments, this technology has been highly inefficient and not
<BR>
of proven safety,&quot; said Friedmann. &quot;There are major technical barriers to
<BR>
using this technology in humans.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Sondra Wheeler, a teacher at the Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington,
<BR>
said permitting IGM research in humans also could be socially disruptive.
<BR>
She said there is the possibility that genetic changes that would produce
<BR>
healthier and improved children would be available only to the wealthy.
<BR>
&quot;This would widen the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' to an
<BR>
unprecedented extent,&quot; the report said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There is a moral problem on the distribution of these benefits,&quot; said
<BR>
Wheeler. &quot;Who gets it? Who decides? What criterion do they apply?&quot;
<BR>
<P>The committee report said a public committee should be organized to monitor
<BR>
and oversee any IGM research on humans. The report called for a public
<BR>
discussion to determine if Americans really want to approve human IGM
<BR>
research.
<BR>
<P>The American Association for the Advancement of Science is the world's
<BR>
largest federation of scientists, with more than 146,000 members. The AAAS
<BR>
publishes Science, one of the world's major, peer-reviewed journals of
<BR>
general scientific research.
