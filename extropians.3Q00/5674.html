<EM>&gt; &gt; Statistically many crimes are stopped by an armed

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, since you brought it up, what are the statistics?
</EM><BR>
<P>Gary Kleck, a rather well respected crime researcher, conducted a study on this
<BR>
and found an annual rate of 2.5 million Defensive Gun Uses per year. Even
<BR>
anti-gunners admit that there are a minimum of 60,000 defensive gun uses (versus
<BR>
9,000 innocent people killed by others with guns, out of a total 32,000 gun
<BR>
deaths per year), derived from strictly defined criteria in the FBI database
<BR>
(part of which includes not counting DGUs which were found to be illegal by
<BR>
defective and onerous state laws and prosecutors). A study done of several dozen
<BR>
major studies in this area came up with an average estimate of around 800,000
<BR>
DGUs per year. While this is obviously a very broad range, given the
<BR>
partisanship of this issue, its to be expected, although Kleck is considered by
<BR>
most on both sides of the issue to be credible.
<BR>
<P>A purely economic study of gun crime vs. gun defense found that so long as
<BR>
civilians kill 2,000 criminals a year with private guns defensively, there is a
<BR>
break even on the economic impact. If civilians kill 3,000 criminals a year
<BR>
defensively, there is somewhere between $1 billion and $30 billion net benefit
<BR>
to the economy. This includes not only the fact that les prison space would need
<BR>
to be built, but lower insurance rates, lower medical costs, less need for
<BR>
police, less need for security systems, etc...
<BR>
<P>Prof. John Lott, in his book _More Guns, Less Crime_ found a significant impact
<BR>
on crime when civilians are more freely allowed to carry concealed weapons,
<BR>
while at the same time found almost no impact from the death penalty as it is
<BR>
currently administered (he studied ALL FBI crime stats from 1979 to 1995, the
<BR>
first and ONLY researcher to do so). The largest anti-gun study of concealed
<BR>
weapon use consisted of only five cherry picked counties that happened to have
<BR>
statistics which supported the anti-gun position on concealed carry. John Lott
<BR>
mentioned this in his book. The author of that study declared Lott's own study
<BR>
'flawed' after refusing to even read it.
