<EM>&gt; It seems far from clear to me that it is trivial to take a design for a bridge,

<EM>&gt; throw some nanodust at it and say &quot;Build it for me over there.&quot;   Assembly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and construction use intelligence, just as design does.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've never constructed anything more complex than a dog house, but it
<BR>
is true that most construction projects are challenging, even with a
<BR>
design that looks good on paper.
<BR>
<P>However I think the reasons are mostly due to imperfections in the
<BR>
environment where the constructed object has to fit in, imperfections
<BR>
in the building materials, and imperfections in my construction technique.
<BR>
<P>With nanotech we might be able to eliminate the last two sources of error.
<BR>
If all parts are perfect and all assembly steps are done with atomic scale
<BR>
precision, there should be no need for intelligence.  Parts are attached
<BR>
or detached by rote, with a check to see if it went right, and (perhaps)
<BR>
discarded if there was a flaw.  This would not take much intelligence.
<BR>
<P>With the bridge example, you'd still have the challenge of fitting a
<BR>
constructed object into a natural environment.  When you build a house
<BR>
you first pour a foundation, so that from that point on you have a stable
<BR>
and smooth surface to build on.  Something similar might suffice for
<BR>
many sorts of nanotech construction efforts.
