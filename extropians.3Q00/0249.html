<EM>&gt; &gt;catholic jokes.

<P>Be the only outsider in a group of insiders, thats where the

great jokes come from.  I had three Jewish friends who let

<BR>
would get telling Jewish jokes, and Gentile jokes.  They would

get bouncing off of each other, Id get laughing at them so

hard I couldnt eat.  spike
