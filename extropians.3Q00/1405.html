<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And why is this an argument in favor of freely copying them?  If it were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possible to freely copy computer chips, would it then follow that we
</EM><BR>
should
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do so because they could be used to serve two people's goals
</EM><BR>
simultaneously?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not by itself an argument for or against anything--it's a fact, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's the direct answer to your direct question &quot;what's the difference...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Asked and answered, counselor, move on.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>This is the start of a slippery defense tactic that you will perpetuate
<BR>
throughout this posting.  You will continue to argue that information should
<BR>
be free from the restrainst of copyright and you will argue that point due
<BR>
to the fact that it is different from material goods.  When I press -that-
<BR>
point (certainly it is different, but is it different in ways that justify
<BR>
the removal of copyright?) you fail to engage the argument, thus giving me
<BR>
no purchase with which to progress.  Further, you will actually accuse me of
<BR>
being -dishonest- in my line of inquiry-- failing to recongnize that points
<BR>
I am making are crucial, not disingenuous.
<BR>
<P>The argument, simplistically, has gone like this:
<BR>
<P>Jason: &quot;Why should we be allowed to freely copy information?&quot;
<BR>
<P>LDC:&quot;Because information is possessed of certain traits.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Jason: &quot;If material goods were possessed of those traits, should we be
<BR>
allowed to freely copy them too?&quot;
<BR>
<P>LDC:&quot;I'm not arguing that.  Can you please just keep talking about
<BR>
information?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Ugh.
<BR>
<P>If you want to argue that information should be free because of 'x,' then
<BR>
you'll have to allow me to argue 'x.'
<BR>
<P>In much of the rest of this posting you look for increasingly wily ways in
<BR>
which I -really- can make money off of my performance/book/movie/software,
<BR>
etc.  I'm sorta tired of engaging each example specifically, and frankly I
<BR>
think they're becoming a little silly-- your money making opportunities have
<BR>
pretty much shrunk to cashing in on &quot;timeliness,&quot; and &quot;authenticity&quot;-- both
<BR>
of which will continue to shrink as the technology gets better.  (i.e.: I
<BR>
can copy your stuff faster and better.)
<BR>
<P>Personally, even -if- I granted that these will be good revenue streams in
<BR>
the future, I still don't think it's a smart idea to build auxiliary reward
<BR>
systems like these.  If we want good innovative content we need to engineer
<BR>
an environment in which that sort of content will be rewarded.  It's not
<BR>
sufficient to simply reward content-- we need to create selection pressures
<BR>
that reward the sort of content we're looking for.  One's ability to
<BR>
distribute content is not a good selection pressure for the quality of that
<BR>
content.  Hey, direct monetary reward is probably not the best selection
<BR>
pressure either-- I'd be very pleased if you came up with a -better- one.
<BR>
<P>You want to directly pay for construction workers, but not architects.  For
<BR>
CD manufacturors, not musicians.  For theatre owners, not filmmakers.  For
<BR>
book binders, not authors.
<BR>
<P>Eventually -everything- is going to be intellectual property Mr. Crocker.
<BR>
The world of blacksmiths and automobile manfacturors is shrinking.  Those so
<BR>
called 'differences' between information and material goods that you argue
<BR>
are going away.
<BR>
<P>That is why I believe that to argue that ownership of information should be
<BR>
eliminated is to argue that ownership of everything should be eliminated.
<BR>
Personally, I think you should just bite the bullet and start arguing -that-
<BR>
point of view-- it is far more consistent and forward looking.
<BR>
<P>-----
<BR>
<P><P>Okay, I couldn't let this one slide by:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; True, so that would be a stupid business model, wouldn't it?  Movies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be licensed to theater owners under NDA, who are given encryption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keys in exchange for agreeing to the terms of how to distribute ticket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revenues.  Ticket revenues alone, without any licensing whatsover, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than enough to make money for good movies.  Even the $100M+ movies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; made millions in profit on ticket sales
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone.
</EM><BR>
<P>Non-disclosure agreements and encryption?  You're going down a dangerous
<BR>
road here Mr. Crocker-- I'm certain you're about to argue a side of the
<BR>
argument with which you do not agree:
<BR>
<P>You can't encrypt the final transmittal of information.  Go to Bali sometime
<BR>
and see how many restaurants show new release movies that were shot on
<BR>
someone's handicam.  Also, it's irrelevant.  I've witnessed excellent
<BR>
versions of both 'The Matrix' and 'Star Wars: Episode I' during the first
<BR>
week of those films release and I happen to know that people possess
<BR>
bootlegs of films that _have_not_yet_been_released. (There goes timeliness.)
<BR>
Please don't argue that we can successfully protect this information since I
<BR>
really doubt that you believe that.  The only thing we can currently protect
<BR>
against is mass commercialization of this bootleg material-- which is to
<BR>
say: it's still hard for me to start screening this material on a very
<BR>
public webpage.  As yet.
<BR>
<P><P>And:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's true, but the system as it is has manipulated the market and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artists to think that copyright is the only way to make money, so they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't pursue options.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why should they pursue other options?  People want music, so musicians make
<BR>
music.  If people want easy-to-find music, or t-shirts to go with their
<BR>
music, then other people (distributors and clothing manufacturors,) should
<BR>
come in to fill those markets.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Do you believe that passing laws making the theft of automobiles illegal
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an example of passing laws to help the automobile industry?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please stay on topic.  You know exactly what I think on the issue,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you know exactly what the difference is, and your dishonestly using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this rhetoric to distract from the real issues.  If you can't argue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honestly, that says something about your arguments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm... okay, you're accusing me of dishonesty here, to which I would usually
<BR>
take offense, but, to be truthful, I don't even really understand what sort
<BR>
of a lie you're accusing me of...
<BR>
<P>I -do- know that this is another example of you trying to -not- talk about
<BR>
the significance of the distinction between material goods and intellectual
<BR>
property and I'd love to oblige you on this, but since it's the very crux of
<BR>
my argument and the very topic under discussion, I think it would be
<BR>
extremely odd for me to just let it go.
<BR>
<P>I hope you won't continue to pursue the tactic of casting aspersions on my
<BR>
integrity to get me to drop the line of questioning to which your beliefs
<BR>
are most vulnerable.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; I stand on my record as a militant capitalist.  I've already explained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many times the difference between physical property and IP, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are people who still can't see the difference, they're beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hope of understanding and I have nothing more to offer them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, so now we're simply daft.  This is a good one: basically you would
<BR>
accuse me of failing to have the intelletual capacity to understand the
<BR>
differences, and so I'm beyond hope and we should just stop talking about
<BR>
the whole issue.  But -every- single time I challenge the significance of
<BR>
those differences, you just deflect the topic.  (Like this.)  Look, if you
<BR>
don't want to talk about this, that's fine.  But please do not cast
<BR>
aspersions on my intellectual comprehension as a means to get me to drop the
<BR>
line of questioning to which your beliefs are most vulnerable.
<BR>
<P>Please refrain from stating:
<BR>
<P>&quot;B should be treated differently from A, because B possesses property x&quot;
<BR>
<P>if you're going to continue to refuse to discuss:
<BR>
<P>&quot;If A had property x, should it too be treated differently?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Ugh.
