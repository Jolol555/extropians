<P>&lt;&lt; Anyone wish to speculate on the outcome?  I predict a hit.
<BR>
&nbsp;Heres part of what the Post had to say:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;On July 7, an interceptor launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific
<BR>
&nbsp;will attempt to knock down a dummy warhead fired from Vandenberg
<BR>
&nbsp;Air Force Base in California. Key factors in the test include not only the
<BR>
&nbsp;ability of the &quot;kill vehicle&quot; to hit the dummy 144 miles above the Earth
<BR>
&nbsp;at a combined speed of 12,000 miles per hour, but also the ability of
<BR>
&nbsp;early-warning satellites to detect the launch and convey that information
<BR>
&nbsp;to a command and control center, which in turn sends the data to Kwajalein.
<BR>
&nbsp;(Washington Post) &gt;&gt;
<BR>
For those of us old enough to remember the cold war and such drama's as  
<BR>
ABC's THe Day After, and the BBC's Threads; If the kill vehicle concept works 
<BR>
in a decent test, I say mazel tov. We need reliable alternatives to mutually 
<BR>
assured destruction; especially now that the main players are Pakistan and 
<BR>
India, who don't really care if 
<BR>
1/2 their populations perish. I mean, from their governments point of view; 
<BR>
who'd really notice? Certainly the standard of living for the survivors 
<BR>
wouldn't change. Jokes asside, the terror the world would experience might 
<BR>
make people more anti-tech.
