<P><EM>&gt; David R. Criswell, yes? 
</EM><BR>
Yep.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I just put the pieces together that he is the same D.R. Criswell that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did so much work on the electrostatic transport of lunar dust in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 70s. He's kind of famous for that work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, he is a serious scientist, which is why stellar husbandry
<BR>
has to be seriously considered as possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The paper that you (Robert) have by Criswell, is this the same as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chapter: &quot;Solar System Industrialization Implications for Interstellar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Migrations&quot; in the book: _Interstellar Migration and Human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Experience_?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, thats the paper.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; email is not such a reliable method to reach me these months
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (PhD endpoint near), phone and in person is better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Amara, don't your filters raise the priority of messages with
<BR>
the name &quot;Amara&quot; in them?  That's a distinct advantage to having
<BR>
a unique name! :-)  I'm moderately sure Robin is bumping up messages
<BR>
that say Robin in them (either that or he's got a email-to-brain
<BR>
interface that is a bit faster than the rest of us).
<BR>
<P>[snip great astrophysics lesson (no tuition required)...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For a moderate mass star, say 5*M_sol, the picture proceeds as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; above. [snip]
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha, but a 5*M_sol star, is unlikely to have a terrestrial type
<BR>
civilization around it (lives too short, higher temps &amp; winds
<BR>
blow dust out of the system sooner resulting in potentially 
<BR>
less planet formation, etc.).
<BR>
<P>Getting back to the Criswell-Lorry (in lieu of the real disputant)
<BR>
debate, the question is whether a typical advanced civilization
<BR>
around probable civilization class stars (See Dole-Asimov,
<BR>
Planets for Man &amp; subsequent works), that have a reasonable liquid
<BR>
water zone.  For that we need to know what are the limits of star
<BR>
lifting/stellar husbandry for stars that may never initiate the
<BR>
higher levels of nucleosynthesis.
<BR>
<P>Put another way -- what are the limits on whether you can drive
<BR>
the star from  F --&gt; G --&gt; M --&gt; L class?  There may be some
<BR>
benefits (100's of millions of years to billions of years),
<BR>
that would create a benefit &gt; cost situation that justifies
<BR>
the effort, even if you cannot ultimately prevent a supernova.
