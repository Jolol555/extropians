Got this in the news today:
<BR>
<P>One Mower Way to Get Even
<BR>
<P>WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Apartment dwellers have a new weapon to use on noisy
<BR>
neighbors, with a New Zealand man recording a compact disc of 64 minutes of
<BR>
lawnmower noise.
<BR>
<P>``If your neighbors have a party Saturday night fairly late...what you do is you
<BR>
get up at seven o'clock in the morning, put the hour of lawnmowing sound on and
<BR>
go out to a cafe,'' Wellington noise man and cafe owner Geoff Marsland told
<BR>
Reuters Monday. The astro-turf covered CD offers listeners general lawnmower
<BR>
sounds along with feature moments such as the emptying of the catcher and stones
<BR>
hitting the blades.
<BR>
<P>Five thousand of the CDs are on the market, of which more than 4,000 have been
<BR>
snapped up by local retailers, Marsland said.
<BR>
<P>The album is his second. He previously sold around 4,200 copies of an album of
<BR>
urban noise such as a car alarm sounding off and a revving motorcycle.
<BR>
<P>That album -- entitled Urban Assault -- also featured three minutes of a baby
<BR>
crying, which Marsland described as the ultimate contraceptive.
<BR>
<P>end...
<BR>
<P>Now, If I'm on the 10th floor, just exactly how are you annoying people? I'd
<BR>
imagine most of one's neighbors would be in stitches....
