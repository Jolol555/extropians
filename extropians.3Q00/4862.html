<P><EM>&gt; Loud and long.  Many ironies present themselves.  For instance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at Schlockheed, the average raise across the board has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about 4%, but the average starting pay for the new guys has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been increasing by about 6% for a long time, consequently there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is salary grade compression: the new guys straight outta school
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are being offered starting salaries equal to what I was making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only 5 yrs ago.  If the trend continues, then soon the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new guy will be offered the average salary of a veteran. Problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is, that isnt enough; they still cant afford to live here on that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Meanwhile the veterans, who have owned a home for a long time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and many own rental property on which they are making a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brutal killing) live quite comfortably.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Lockheed is a dinosaur.  They will be/are losing their best people to
<BR>
the highly heated and ultra-salary-competive  market.  If they don't
<BR>
raise people at least 10% a year they can expect the brightest to change
<BR>
jobs every 2 years or less simply to stay at par.  
<BR>
<P>In many high-tech areas, especially software, being a &quot;veteran&quot; isn't
<BR>
any automatic guarantee of being a better worker/engineeer/scientist
<BR>
much less of being paid more. 
<BR>
<P>I worry about another problem.  Technology is still marching forward.  I
<BR>
support this 101% of course.  But, as it advances it automates more and
<BR>
more job levels.  I predict that within 5-10 years it will automate most
<BR>
of what is called programming today.  This is only one example.  As we
<BR>
get more powerful computers at lower cost with more AIish abilities more
<BR>
and more jobs will fall to them.  We had best be thinking really hard
<BR>
right now about how we plan to have people have a decent life without a
<BR>
regular for pay job.  Despite the current rather slanted rosy
<BR>
unemployment statistics in the US, the problem is real and it will
<BR>
eventually hit even many of us.  
<BR>
<P>This technology is supposed to be about a more abundant life for human
<BR>
beings.  When the technology takes over what the human beings had being
<BR>
doing to support themselves the human beings must still be supported. 
<BR>
Unless you believe these human beings should simply be left on the junk
<BR>
heap of history. If you do believe that don't come crying when it
<BR>
happens to you.
