<P><EM>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt;Please explain how a gamma ray photon could blow a radio photon away.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Gamma ray photon hits radio photon, cancels out energy of said photon, or merly
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; knocks it down to a lower frequency (or up to a higher frequency). If the signal
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; is frequency modulated, your signal loses resolution.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. Gamma ray and radio photons are both bosons, they have integer spin so they
<BR>
are not bound by The Pauli Exclusion Principle. Two photons can be in the same
<BR>
quantum state but no two particles with half integer spin, like electrons, can be.
<BR>
It's a good thing that things don't work as you suggest,  if photons had half integer spins
<BR>
and thus could not be in the same place at the same time then you couldn't see the moon
<BR>
or the stars or even the man sitting next to you. Photons from an object you wanted to look
<BR>
at would collide and be hopelessly scrambled by photons moving at right angles to them.
<BR>
You'd be blind as a bat.
<BR>
<P>Well ok, I have heard of some theoretical work that if the Gamma rays were intense enough,
<BR>
and I mean intense, the sort of thing you only find near a black hole or Gamma ray burster, then
<BR>
there might be a little scattering, but if you're that near a Gamma ray burster the fact that your
<BR>
communication network is not working at optimal performance will be the least of your worries.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Ever heard of radar jamming, john?
</EM><BR>
<P>What do you think?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; You just are not making your neutradio from the right materials, obviously.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I give you a magic material that stops neutrinos for your neutradio then you have
<BR>
to give me a magic material that can stop neutrinos before they ever get to you.
<BR>
Why all this neutrino business, radio works just fine, if it's nor broken don't fix it.
