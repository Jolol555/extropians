From: &quot;Joe Dees&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joedees@addall.com?Subject=Re:%20GUNS:%20Re:%20Why%20Here?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009211417.HAA02171@well.com&gt;">joedees@addall.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The full text of the 2nd amendment:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not be infringed. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As is blindingly obvious, well-regulated militias and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dependence of the security of free states upon them are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasons given, WITHIN THE 1791 AMENDMENT ITSELF, for preserving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the right to keep and bear arms.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There is a word for what your trying to pull here, how ironic that
<BR>
it is today's AWAD.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;eisegesis (eye-si-JEE-sis) noun, plural eisegeses (-seez)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;An interpretation, especially of Scripture, that expresses the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interpreter's own ideas, bias, or the like, rather than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;meaning of the text.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;[From Greek eisegesis, equivalent to eis- into + (h)ege- (stem of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hegeisthai to lead) + -sis.]
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;It should be noted that the Tenth Amendment does not say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powers not explicitly delegated to the United States are reserved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the states, even though the Supreme Court, in a startling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example of eisegesis, once read the word explicitly into the text
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the Tenth Amendment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   John A. Rohr, Public administration and comparative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;constitutionalism, Public Administration Review, Jul 8, 1997.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This week's theme: words about words.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The big thieves hang the little ones. -Czech proverb
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact of the matter is that we have all of the related writings
<BR>
from the founding fathers who wrote the 2nd Amendment including
<BR>
Jefferson, who did in fact re-write it.
<BR>
<P>We know exactly what they meant, which is completely different from
<BR>
the way you are trying to interpret it. The intent was always that
<BR>
individual citizens were to be armed.
<BR>
<P>The last time the anti-gun faction tried this ploy, they
<BR>
inadvertantly started the militia movement.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;But the loopholes in the laws could accommodate Mack trucks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certainly MAC-10's (previously purchased, or imported, assault
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weapons and clips were grandfathered in).  The flea market and gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;show loophole allows felons to purchase, and the 25% of dealers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there who are private have no checking requirements on them.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm-a-collector-who-buys-a-thousand-of-the-same-model-each-week
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;private citizen loophole - guess how the weapons find themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into black markets?
</EM><BR>
<P>No matter how many laws above the existing 20,000+ gun laws you
<BR>
create, there will always be loopholes. Or as is more likely the
<BR>
perpetrators of the crime will simply ignore them all together. 
<BR>
<P>Thats what criminals do Joe, they ignore laws they don't like.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've suggested others that would have more effect, and the NICS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;checks will have more effect once more of the relevant records are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computerized, which is NOT the case presently.
</EM><BR>
<P>No amount of gun laws will ever accomplish what you have in mind,
<BR>
that's the whole point.
<BR>
<P>Registration is just a stepping stone to confiscation, even the 65
<BR>
to 80 million gun owners who are not members of the NRA know that.
<BR>
<P>I've a better idea for a law, how about a law that says only NRA
<BR>
members can own guns? (kidding for the satirically impaired.)
<BR>
<P>The only thing blindingly obvious is that you will never be happy
<BR>
till you get your way.
<BR>
<P>And I won't need to post this twice to try and make my point.
<BR>
<P>In fact it's time to try and retire this thread again.
