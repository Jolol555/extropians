<EM>&gt; Nope. It's not fantasy at all. It's real. It's here. It's now.

<P>Well, JR, my investigation of the matter tells me that the knowledge in
<BR>
the public domain alone is sufficient that a mega-project could be
<BR>
undertaken now to develop AI to surpass human equivalency and it would be
<BR>
analogous to the man-on-the-moon effort from a 1960 vantage point. In
<BR>
other words, put 10 years and x billion $ into it and we can expect to
<BR>
succeed. Between 2000 and 2010 might require tens of billions, even
<BR>
hundreds of billions of dollars but we can plan it out now and we can see
<BR>
that applying known technology on a large scale will solve most of the
<BR>
problems. The &quot;unknowns&quot; refer to innovations/inventions to go forward. I
<BR>
think these are in four categories: (1) visual object 
<BR>
recognition/itemization in cluttered environments; (2) voice recognition
<BR>
with lots of static/background noise and a not-so-clear
<BR>
signal; (3) reading-question-answer sequences or data mining from text (ie
<BR>
reading ability); (4) conversational programming, ie getting a machine to
<BR>
converse as well as a human.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is even possible that some private/military budgets have done it
<BR>
already. If not, they must be trying to develop it. No first rate military
<BR>
could let this go by. But whenever I contemplate the prospect of this
<BR>
being here-and-now it boggles my mind as much as considering the prospect
<BR>
that ufo's and grey aliens are here. Frankly it is hard to imagine
<BR>
conversing with a robot as you would with a human and being able to
<BR>
consult with that robot as an extremely capable professional in many
<BR>
fields (engineer, doctor, lawyer, you name it). Hard to imagine that robot
<BR>
being able to add to its knowledge base faster than any human (learn new
<BR>
material). And consider that such a capable machine could work 24 hours a
<BR>
day and could replicate itself.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in that context that the Kurzweil statement from the web site you
<BR>
gave me is plausible,
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/2000/09/12/17734">http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/2000/09/12/17734</A>&gt;. &quot;It
<BR>
is not the case that we will experience 100 years of progress in the
<BR>
21st. century; rather we will witness on the order of 20,000 years of
<BR>
progress (at today's rate of progress, that is).&quot; Mind boggling...
<BR>
<P>20,000 YEARS OF PROGRESS IN 100 YEARS
<BR>
<P>I can logic this out in the context of what a $100 b. investment in Honda
<BR>
Humanoids for example should yield in 10 years. And I can imagine those
<BR>
conversing Honda Humanoid's in 10 years time with capabilities as
<BR>
above. Then I say, &quot;I'm just fantasizing&quot;. There really is a psychological
<BR>
shut-off mechanism operating here. So I keep going out for the &quot;reality
<BR>
checks&quot; as I did recently in some correspondence with Minsky and
<BR>
Engelberger. Well, they couldn't talk me out of my &quot;fantasy&quot; so it goes
<BR>
on.
