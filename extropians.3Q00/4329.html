<P>In a way, the title of my most recent book on &gt;H topics could have been THE
<BR>
LAST HUMAN GENERATION (rather than just THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION). I do
<BR>
repeatedly make the point in these books that current-model humans are
<BR>
likely to be extinct within a century: not by death, but by enhanced
<BR>
transformation. It's funny to see how uncomfortable this suggestion makes
<BR>
the traditionally religious, who insist the rest of time that just such an
<BR>
outcome (but only *their* authorized version, naturally) is on the cards...
<BR>
<P>It's also apparent from sf that deals with transcendence that the reader
<BR>
(and writer) usually has very mixed responses to the prospect. Arthur
<BR>
Clarke's CHILDHOOD'S END is almost unbearably poignant as the children of
<BR>
humanity transcend into unity with a kind of cosmic Ur-Mind. Greg Bear's
<BR>
BLOOD MUSIC has some of the same regretful feeling to it. Only Greg Egan
<BR>
seems free of sentimentality in his embrace of the posthuman, and his work
<BR>
is almost always rather too chilly for comfort. (My own novel THE JUDAS
<BR>
MANDALA, written so long ago that these notions were fairly new to me, was
<BR>
off the mark: I approved of a transcendent Omega Point universal Mind at
<BR>
the end of time, named as such before Tipler had the same idea, but I
<BR>
proposed that history would be a contest between such an entity derived
<BR>
from organic life and another drawn from `cold' machine or cyborg
<BR>
consciousnesses. Of course this is still possible, but I now believe such
<BR>
crude dualities miss the point.)
