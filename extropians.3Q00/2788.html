ct,
<BR>
<P>thanks for the great link.  I really enjoyed the article even though the last time I visited Seattle I was eleven.  I will oneday have to visit it again.  
<BR>
<P>Here in Anchorage we have what are known as &quot;oil companies&quot; who tend to stingily donate money for their own p.r. desires.  Though they do spend a ton of money on tv commercials saying how great they are for the state and community.  I wish they would donate that money to a good cause and spare me the nauseous propoganda.
<BR>
<P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, that was implicit in my irony, of course, but really I don't think

&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; ...No, the *real* power is in the hands of the
&gt;&gt; technocracy.  Ahhhh, nerdvana.  To hell with the meek, the smart have
&gt;&gt; finally inherited the earth.  spike
&gt;
&gt;&gt; It was always a misprint - it should say &quot;the geek shall inherit the
&gt;earth&quot;.
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it's singular; big bill.
&gt;&gt; Emlyn
&gt;
&gt;Another dissipating 'singularity' it seems.
&gt;
&gt;Originally portrayed as a father-son event (see Warren Buffet &amp; Bill Gates
&gt;in your favorite search engine), this election-year's powermonger festival
&gt;seems to be shaping up as a Gates-Allen duel. Perhaps this is most evident
&gt;in the State of Washington, where the Lakeside alumni are quite successfully
&gt;bred. Allen's 'failed' Common's venture seeded his growing culture of
&gt;real-estate holdings in the Seattle area. Combine this with the Seahawks and
&gt;Experience Music Project(EMP) and you will get dizzy trying to distill his
&gt;diversified strategies into a cohesive plan. Top this with his recent $11M
&gt;to SETI for The Allen Array and what have you got?
&gt;
&gt;Compare this to Gate's 'altruistic' giving to vaccinate the entire
&gt;third-world population, college-funding for minorities, and matching grant
&gt;for low-income housing for families with children.
&gt;
&gt;Can &quot;Allen takes on Gates&quot; be far behind &quot;Bush takes on Gore&quot; ???

&gt;Cute!
