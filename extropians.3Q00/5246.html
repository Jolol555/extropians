<P><EM>&gt; What is being ignored? The fact is that the people who create stuff need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live. The inscentive of wealth is ONE tool that is useful to to encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creativeness. Historical analysis suggests that to date, it seems to be one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the most effective tools to do so. So the better question is: Do we need the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current or higher levels of creativity, or can we survive in societies of lesser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creativity before we engulf the planet? I say we need as high a level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creativity as possible. It is understood, that at some point, there are only so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many boats and cars you can park in your garage to make you happy, however a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creative person can ALWAYS, I think, find something new and better to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more wealth.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is being ignored is that to date we have been living largely in
<BR>
scarcity.  As our tech advances rapidly toward singularity we live in
<BR>
comparative abundance.  It literally takes less and less human labor to
<BR>
produce most of our needs and many of our wants.  
<BR>
<P>Throughout history the truly creative have strived to find some way to
<BR>
be able to create.  In pre-capitalist periods that often required having
<BR>
a patron.  This was true of the arts and sciences as well.  In
<BR>
capitalist times, particularly for technology leading to easier creation
<BR>
of economic goods and services creativity has come to be rewarded more
<BR>
directly.  But I think it is wrong to say that being paid or well paid
<BR>
calls forth or somehow causes the creativity.  It is enabler in a
<BR>
society where money determines whether people have the means to survive,
<BR>
much less create.  As we gain greater abundance, there is no need that
<BR>
survival be contingent on working a normal job for a salary at all. 
<BR>
Freed from the need to &quot;earn a living&quot; the creative should if anything
<BR>
be more creative.  
<BR>
<P>Now there is the question of how whatever resource remain somewhat
<BR>
scarce get allocated wisely and especially to some of the most creative
<BR>
and producitive people.   But by the time we get to nanotech (if not
<BR>
sooner) all the material means needed to create most things with
<BR>
material dependencies will or can be freely available.  What will still
<BR>
be the most rare and valued is highly creative and talented sentiences.
<BR>
<P>My original suggestion we are missing some of the true issues was fueled
<BR>
by discussion that seemed to assume that &quot;intellectual property&quot; is
<BR>
actually a well defined and valid concept.  I question this.  Especially
<BR>
since the truly creative, and especially if freed from &quot;making a
<BR>
living&quot;, need the free flow of information and intellectual productions
<BR>
of others more than they generally need or want to fence off their own
<BR>
productions as sacrosanct IP.  Areas of intellectual creativity and
<BR>
enterprise like sciences and software actually experience serious
<BR>
breakage when discoveries and techniques are walled off from relatively
<BR>
free use.  We need to protect the integrity of works from rank plagarism
<BR>
or modification but this is quite different from most of what is spoken
<BR>
of in the IP discussions today.
<BR>
<P>Before we get too far along in deciding our position on these &quot;IP&quot;
<BR>
&quot;violations&quot; I think it would be good to discuss what IP means and to
<BR>
what extent and in what contexts we find it valid.
<BR>
<P>Also, in the case of Napster, I think we need to ask whether it makes
<BR>
sense to accuse people who simply use the internet to share music that
<BR>
they would share with friends anyway to be actual &quot;pirates&quot; in any
<BR>
meaningful sense.  It also has been pointed out that most muscicians
<BR>
never get rich at all from their work no matter how well received it is.
<BR>
The lion's share of most music revenues goes to the recording industry.
<BR>
In this day and age of nearly instant global communication most of the
<BR>
recording industry's advertising and distribution costs are simply
<BR>
archaic and highly overpriced overhead.
<BR>
<P>The dumbest thing to me about Napster is that the recording industry
<BR>
didn't embrace the idea as free advertising and take it a step further
<BR>
by offering custom CDs containing your favorite music as well as
<BR>
anywhere availability of your music and perhaps per play micro-charges.
<BR>
<P>In the long run though, the current music industry must change.  It is
<BR>
incompatible with the every free and faster flow of information. 
<BR>
Blocking that flow too much impoverishes us all.
<BR>
<P>Yes, artists deserve to make a living.  But it doesn't require
<BR>
protecting an outmoded way of publishing and distribution to take care
<BR>
of that.  Most artists do not create to get rich.  They create because
<BR>
they love to create.
