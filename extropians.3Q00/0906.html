&quot;FM-2030,&quot; All Things Considered, Tuesday, July 11, 2000, RealAudio available 
<BR>
at &lt;<A HREF="http://search.npr.org/cf/cmn/cmnps05fm.cfm?SegID=76532">http://search.npr.org/cf/cmn/cmnps05fm.cfm?SegID=76532</A>&gt;.  Summary:  &quot;A 
<BR>
futurist who changed his name to FM-2030 died last weekend of pancreatic 
<BR>
cancer. FM-2030 was originally named F.M. Esfandiary. In 1977, he predicted 
<BR>
scientists would one day correct people's genetic flaws. In 1980, he 
<BR>
predicted telecommunications technology would change the way people shop. 
<BR>
Noah talks with Flora Schnall, an attorney and longtime friend of FM-2030. 
<BR>
(4:00).&quot;
<BR>
<P>I found the story remarkably tasteful and very sympathetically rendered.  Ms. 
<BR>
Schnall did a great job of describing FM's work, motivations, and suspension. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Those of you interested in presenting extropian ideas to the media might 
<BR>
benefit from hearing her articulate and moving account of one visionary's 
<BR>
life--and its temporary interruption.
<BR>
<P>T.0. Morrow
