<P>
<EM>&gt; It is my opinion that depression never killed anybody. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds pretty omniscient to me. How would you ever find out if it had,
<BR>
with an opinion like that stuck in the way?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In general,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suicide is the treatment of choice for those who are afraid to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; openly express intense rage and whose self-pity motivates a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire to inflict the punishment of guilt on selected survivors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fah. Mush words like &quot;in general&quot; after such a bold lead?
<BR>
<P>I think Durkheim had a few things right about it. I'm assuming you've
<BR>
read Durkheim and can refute his notions handily, right?  
<BR>
<P>Here's a hint: we have no way of *knowing* how many
<BR>
car-hits-bridge-abutment accidents every year are &quot;really&quot; suicides. The
<BR>
stats could be skewed toward the more florid cases, where your
<BR>
procrustean pronouncements might ship a little less water. And Freud and
<BR>
Jung are matching period poets, of seminal artistry, but hardly the
<BR>
final word on any matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At any rate, we may suppose that at least some exogenous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depressions are a phase in a process of psychic reconstruction.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Robert M. Owen
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we may. but why pick out exogenous ones for attention? Is this just
<BR>
a trompe l'oeil of the old &quot;that which does not kill me makes me
<BR>
stronger&quot; boosterism? 
<BR>
<P>Cordially,
<BR>
<P>MMB
<BR>
(I seem to be back...)
