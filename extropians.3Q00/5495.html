<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;A random person in the world will be chosen, and you get this choice:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a) Let them have $X more worth of real resources (such as by telling them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to find an oil reserve that would otherwise remain unfound.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;b) Nothing happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Which do you choose?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would choose not to give it to him. I do so because I know that if this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person (person Y) is wealthier, then that means that whatever wealth I have,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is lessened. If Joe X wants to sell some property and I want to buy it, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have if I let this person Y have the oil wealth which would otherwise remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfound, then there is more competition for the property I bidding for, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the price goes up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>That does not follow unless you believe wealth is static.  There is more
<BR>
competition if the person wants the same limited resource as you.  There
<BR>
is also one more person with more resources, which, if used wisely will
<BR>
produce more wealth for you and everyone else.  I would take the chance
<BR>
on the competition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Wealth is relative, in many respects (and this does not pertain to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heightened standards of living caused by the accumulation of the benefits of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology &amp; engineering, etc).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So why do people choose not to let this person Y have the wealth, and why do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we not know why they make this decision?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because people make these types of decisions without thinking. They don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to think about it. There is a survival advantage to thinking this way;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's bred into us over eons.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a survival advantage only in a world of scarcity where even
<BR>
mere surival actually is pretty problematic.  The trouble is we haven't
<BR>
thought past genetic conditioning that is largely outmoded.
