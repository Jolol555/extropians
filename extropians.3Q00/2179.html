<P>Assuming the same sized customer pool, who will earn more money-- the
<BR>
artist whose work gets downloaded freely and 10% of whose customers pay
<BR>
the voluntary shareware fee-- or the artist who is represented by a
<BR>
record label/publisher that forces 100% of the customers to pay up, but
<BR>
keep 90% of the take?
<BR>
<P>Also... I happen to work with computers. But even if I didn't, I'd
<BR>
still be fiddling around with them for fun. The truly cool stuff I've
<BR>
done was not for pay. It was because it needed to be done. Or because I
<BR>
was curious to see if I could do it. Once an individual has scrambled
<BR>
above the necessity rungs of the Maslovian ladder, then fascination,
<BR>
perfectionism, curiousity, respect of peer group, acquisition of
<BR>
power... these things become forces on par with financial reward.
<BR>
<P>After all, money is important only insofar as it is a means to an end,
<BR>
and if you can short-circuit the process and get at the end itself, who
<BR>
needs money? If I can energize transhumanism, and transhumanism can
<BR>
energize society as a whole, and as part of a general renaissance
<BR>
someone comes up with a reliable way of reviving cryonauts or reversing
<BR>
the aging process... that's exactly what I would have paid my surplus 
<BR>
money to do anyway, if there was a mechanism in place to accept my donation
<BR>
and channel it to these causes.
