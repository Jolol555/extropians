<P>
The following are a few thoughts running through my mind at this moment
<BR>
which give credence to the fact that I support and appreciate Extropy
<BR>
Institute.
<BR>
<P>Extropy Institute provided me, personally, with a venue for exploring ideas
<BR>
about the future, engaging in heady conversations, and a milieu to develop
<BR>
and exhibit my own visions.  In that I have been a long-time transhuman, it
<BR>
was not until I joined Extropy Institute that I felt a sense of
<BR>
connectivity.  While throughout the 1980s I attended gatherings and
<BR>
classes, as well as produced my own gatherings and classes on transhuman
<BR>
ideas and transhumanism, Extropy Institute was the first and remains to be
<BR>
the best way for me to interact with individuals who I enjoy discussing
<BR>
issues with, who I can brainstorm my own work with, who I can extrapolate
<BR>
potential business plans with, and who I can feel relaxed and comfortable
<BR>
with in personal relations.
<BR>
<P>Extropy Institute is the main futurist organization that has provided me
<BR>
with a resource of information instrumental to my life.  Extropy Institute,
<BR>
through its conferences, meetings, gatherings, email lists and Web site has
<BR>
brought together diverse and talented thinkers, across the fuzzy lines of
<BR>
study and expertise, to explore ideas about how current and future trends
<BR>
affects us.
<BR>
<P>I also appreciate Extropy Institute's patience in welcoming those who are
<BR>
new to futuristic ideas and encouraging and promoting those who need
<BR>
substantial leads on &quot;who, what and where,&quot; as well as assisting those who
<BR>
want to discuss possible collaborations.
<BR>
<P>Extropy Institute is fair-minded when it comes to costs of conferences and
<BR>
meetings -- careful not to charge enormous fees for membership and then
<BR>
outrageous fees for attending gatherings.
<BR>
<P>Extropy Institute has spearheaded the conceptualization of ways to engineer
<BR>
smart and positive memes and also to work within the current technological
<BR>
interfaces so that many can participate in such information.
<BR>
<P>Extropy Institute has been proactive in developing a trans-humanitarian
<BR>
outlook, as its concerns about transhumanity exceed far beyond the current
<BR>
issues on the table and works toward understanding many of the consequences
<BR>
that lie before us.
<BR>
<P><P>Thank you ExI!
