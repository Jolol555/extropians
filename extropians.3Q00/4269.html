<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; A corporate CEO, chairman, or president is held accountable by the board of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; directors (i.e. congress) who themselves are held accountable by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; stockholders (the body of voters).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; If a corporation is a dictatorship, then so is every 'democratic' society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ever existed, and there is no such thing as democracy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Err...not quite.  In a democracy, one person = one vote, and buying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; votes is (supposedly) out of bounds.  In a corporation, one stock = one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vote, and buying stock is how one is supposed to acquire votes.  Thus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those with the most money invested in the company have the largest say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and they're going to be interested in making more money with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; money.  They also tend to vote themselves into the board of directors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thus making the board in practice accountable to no one but itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (since they are typically the majority stockholders).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a world where the opinions of the population are controlled or manipulated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the media, those who own the presses are just as manipulative of a democratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system as a rich man is of a corporation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  But the owners of the presses are not necessarily the same as
<BR>
the owners of those who hold high elected offices.  Plus, it is
<BR>
possible, even if rare, for non-corporate-owned voices to gain a
<BR>
significant foothold among the populace.  A rich man owning a
<BR>
corporation also controls all official communication in said
<BR>
corporation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; An employee has the choice whether or not to be a voter, by buying stock, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; as every citizen of a democratic country is free to choose whether or not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; vote. Is the elected president of a country a dictator simply because some part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the population decides not to vote?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Unless said employee has lots of money to invest - which is almost never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the case - said votes will be worthless in practice, as described above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not so. The employees typically outnumber other investors by far, and if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are unionized, their union would also tend to be one of the largest stockholders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the company (if they were smart).
</EM><BR>
<P>Employee numbers don't matter; just the total amount of stock owned.
<BR>
The tactic you cite is a good way to balance executive control;
<BR>
unfortunately, it is far easier for an executive (one person) to recruit
<BR>
other large shareholders with a consistent message (and, sometimes,
<BR>
access to company info that the rank and file are forbidden to know)
<BR>
than it is for a union.
<BR>
<P>(Granted, this is only for companies with a lot of union employees,
<BR>
which excludes certain industries...but it is my impression - possibly
<BR>
false - that those industries also tend to have flatter management
<BR>
hierarchies, and thus don't have as much of a problem of seemingly
<BR>
arbitrary executive decisions.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A voter in a nation of 200-300 million people is worth far less than an employee
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owning 100-1000 shares of stock in the company they are employed by.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even if said company has over 200-300 billion shares outstanding?  The
<BR>
numbers (percent of control) disagree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties are in league with the major media, which uses its propaganda power to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program the sheeple, the vote of one individual is always outvoted as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>And many investors (the general public) aren't sheeple too?
