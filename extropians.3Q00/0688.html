<P><EM>&gt; 1) As you may have heard Microsoft is trying very much to regain control

<EM>&gt; by putting all of their software back into their central servers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could you cite a reference for this?  (It sounds a bit far-fetched.)
<BR>
Perhaps you mean that they intend to move to an active license
<BR>
monitoring system for their software -- i.e. their software comes
<BR>
from their servers when you need it.  This is &quot;software on demand&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;software rental&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only way you'll be able to use software in the future is by logging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in to their system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm, I doubt it will fly.  I can always disconnect my ADSL line
<BR>
when I boot my home PC.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Wow, this sounds secure.  Just think, all those things you do on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer - private memos, dictation's, dirty pictures, all of it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be stored and manipulated via programs you login into at Microsoft's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'Central' servers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nobody in their right mind will buy this option.  Corporate presidents
<BR>
will not store corporate data at Microsoft unless Microsoft accepts
<BR>
liability for data loss, guarantees privacy, etc.  Even Microsoft
<BR>
doesn't have pockets deep enough for that.
<BR>
<P>I think you may be confusing getting the software &quot;on demand&quot; from
<BR>
a remote server with where the data the software uses is stored.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Regardless of anything they may claim, they will have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full power to control what you see, use and do, and ultimately have all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the tools necessary to collect complete dossiers on what we all use,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how we're using it, and where their software is being accessed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, they could monitor you every time you start Excel or Powerpoint
<BR>
but that would require permanent connections for all PCs and we are
<BR>
a long way away from that.
<BR>
<P>How you extrapolate that to &quot;full power to control what you see or do&quot;
<BR>
isn't clear to me.  You can make your data arbitrarily secure by simply
<BR>
encrypting it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The old idea of liberating the people by offering them desktop computers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flattening hierarchies, decentralizing power will have been undone.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have returned to the old paradigm of large centralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; info-warehouses with the rest of us left with nothing more than dumb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terminals circa 1970.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  If so its going to be a big disappointment to Intel or TransMeta.
<BR>
<P>There is nothing wrong with info-warehouses to backup encrypted data
<BR>
or centralized corporate databases for information sharing (group-mind)
<BR>
activities.
<BR>
<P>If Microsoft makes their licensing of software more restrictive people
<BR>
will simply move to other suppliers, esp. open source systems if they
<BR>
feel so inclined.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This whole thing bothers me a great deal, and for all intents and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes is a return to Orwellian thinking with a vengeance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>Most software is licensed, not owned.  If the supplier wants to &quot;fix&quot;
<BR>
the software so the license conditions can be verified (to reduce piracy)
<BR>
then they have the right to do that.  If they do it in a way that annoys
<BR>
people, then they will lose market share.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) -- re: construction of an open-source assembler --
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So here is the golden question - will the creator of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first assembler, weather it be Zyvex or some other company hold ALL the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patent and intellectual property rights to all future assemblers based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their design?
</EM><BR>
<P>According to patent law, for ~20 years yes.  The key words are &quot;their design&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since it is likely that hundreds of other companies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will also be able to invent their own assemblers based on previous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research, it is likely that they will be similar enough to Zyvex's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design, that Zyvex could you use the power of law to stop them from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using it.  Or would it?
</EM><BR>
<P>There seems to be an assumption that there is only 1 path to an assembler.
<BR>
That is highly doubtful.  High tech companies make businesses out of
<BR>
figuring out ways around each others patents.  Its a complex
<BR>
business decision whether to try and work around a patent or to
<BR>
pay whatever licensing fees are being demanded.  If IBM wants to
<BR>
pay Zyvex $50 billion for the rights to use the assembler patents
<BR>
I doubt Zyvex is going to say no...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it just as likely that nanotech will be so powerful, that the rule of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law will be quickly ignored and hundreds of developers will jump on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revolution anyway?
</EM><BR>
<P>Once you have the first assembler (proof of principle), you can bet that
<BR>
many companies (and countries) will start projects to build their own.  
<BR>
It is doubtful that &quot;rule of law&quot; will be ignored however.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just imagine one and only ONE COMPANY having sole legal power of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotechnology.
</EM><BR>
<P>It will not happen (at least for long).  The phase space for assembling
<BR>
things is likely to be very large.
<BR>
<P>It may make sense to have a handful of companies (Zyvex and licencees
<BR>
or Zyvex and competitors) to have the sole lawful right to manufacture
<BR>
nanotech based designs.  Given the power of nanotechnology, you may
<BR>
want the designs going through careful review before they are manufactured
<BR>
just to insure that dangerous stuff is not being manufactured.
<BR>
<P>Do you want every Tom, Dick and Harry to be able to have the ability
<BR>
to assemble bubonic plague in their basement?
<BR>
<P>It is likely that a small set of companies will become leaders in
<BR>
the economy from a manufacturing perspective.  They will make their
<BR>
money by imposing a small surcharge on the cost of the raw materials
<BR>
and manufacturing.  (It may be a big surcharge until the competition
<BR>
gets rolling...).  But the *real* money isn't in the manufacturing,
<BR>
it is in the designs.  It will be interesting to see how the
<BR>
open source design debate plays out, since there are strong
<BR>
arguments for the manufacuturers to not build things not open source
<BR>
(approved/reviewed) designs.  [Do you want to be the company that
<BR>
manufactures the device that turns Cleveland into Grey Goo?  How
<BR>
the liability issues are handled is going to be quite interesting.]
<BR>
<P>In short, I think the concerns you cite are unlikely to be those that
<BR>
will cause significant problems.
