</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  What work? Was I critisizing someone's work? Where? When?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, yes, you were.  You said that the Singularity is pie-in-the-sky,
<BR>
invented by the evil Extropian dogmatists to keep themselves complacent. 
<BR>
This, with respect to the field I've chosen to spend my entire life pursuing.
<BR>
<P>Now, the correct thing to do would have been to say:  &quot;Wow, you mean there are
<BR>
people actually working specifically towards the Singularity?  Sorry, I didn't
<BR>
know.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; There is only one reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Sure there is. So? You know the exact nature of it in all of its details? You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know everything there is to know about how the human mind works? The human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; body? The nature of consciousness?
</EM><BR>
<P>I know enough about intelligence to take a shot at building one from scratch. 
<BR>
I don't know everything, just as a modern-day physicist doesn't know
<BR>
everything about physics.  That is utterly irrelevant when it comes to making
<BR>
firm judgements with respect to the things I do know about, which includes a
<BR>
lot of territory commonly regarded as ineffable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  When do you get your Nobel Prize, Eli? I want to see you collect it since you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know all of these things.
</EM><BR>
<P>They don't give out Nobel Prizes for cognitive science.  If they did, there'd
<BR>
be nothing particularly implausible about the prospect of my winning one.
