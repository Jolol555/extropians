<P><EM>&gt;I wouldn't use exactly the same labels as you did, David; but I do think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's important to recognize the difference between people who are trained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to use a gun properly and who regularly practice that skill; and people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who are not trained and current.  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;IMO people who buy guns for self defense but don't learn how to properly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use them are in more danger than if they didn't own a gun, for 2 reasons:
</EM><BR>
<P>I think we're nearly in violent agreement.  The list was not meant to be 
<BR>
comprehensive.  I singled out &quot;liberals who get a gun for self-defense&quot; 
<BR>
as one of the most dangerous group of gun owners deliberately.
<BR>
<P>A pattern I've seen often:  a long-time liberal is staunchly anti-gun.  They
<BR>
often have had no direct personal experience using a gun.  They then either 
<BR>
become a crime victim or greatly fear that they will be.  They reluctantly
<BR>
buy a gun.  They are afraid of the gun, and embarrassed to have compromised
<BR>
their principles.
<BR>
<P>They resolve the cognitive dissonance with a compromise.  They have the gun,
<BR>
but they do not obtain suitable training.  They do not practice.  They do
<BR>
not teach their children gun safety.
<BR>
<P>Consequently, their children are at risk.  They are at risk.  And innocent
<BR>
by-standers are at risk.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;second, having the gun often gives people a false sense of security so they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't take as many precautions as they ordinarily would to avoid trouble in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the first place. Part of learning how to use a gun properly includes learning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the limitations of the gun and of oneself.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are six or seven gun axioms that are carved on the lining of my skull.
<BR>
One of them:  never assume in a situation that if you are armed, you will 
<BR>
remain armed.  Important corollaries:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't enter a situation armed that you wouldn't be comfortable entering 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unarmed.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a fallback plan in case you are disarmed, your weapon fails, or you've
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run out of ammunition.  
<BR>
<P>A related axiom is never have a gun for self-defense unless you are ready,
<BR>
willing, and able emotionally and technically to kill someone.  You *cannot*
<BR>
say &quot;I'll just point it at them but I wouldn't really shoot&quot; or &quot;I'll just
<BR>
wound them.&quot;  If you feel that way, don't get a gun.  You're needlessly
<BR>
endangering yourself and others.
