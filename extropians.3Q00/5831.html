<P>
Samantha Atkins complains,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You don't need a particularly fast computer to run digital evolution
</EM><BR>
software.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You sure as hell do if you are going to replay all of evolution from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bacteria to human beings as was initially implied.
</EM><BR>
<P>Artificial Intelligence and/or Artificial Life does not imply replaying all of
<BR>
evolution from bacteria to human beings, it implies evolving life forms in
<BR>
billions of generations from intelligent digital agents to genetically
<BR>
programmed evolvable machines. If Tom Ray or someone else has evolved artificial
<BR>
life with a 486 computer, then that means it doesn't require a particularly fast
<BR>
computer by today's standards. It requires a particularly novel set of
<BR>
algorithms, and genetic programming produced dozens of novel solutions last year
<BR>
(or so I've read).
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Something beckons within the reach of each of us
<BR>
to save heroic genius. Find it, and do it.
<BR>
For as goes heroic genius, so goes humankind.&quot;
