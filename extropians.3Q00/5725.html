Eugene Leitl writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Notice that Eliezer does not want to use evolutionary algorithms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably because he (rightfully) suspects that the result will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily be friendly to mehums, in fact is extremely unlikely to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friendly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps I tend to think that genetic programming will eventuate in a friendly AI
<BR>
because I don't know enough about coding a transhuman AI. (Who does?) No matter
<BR>
what architectural route results in an actual AI, I still maintain that the AI
<BR>
will want to be friendly because along the way to human-competitive AI (I think
<BR>
many stages of problem solving ability will precede a full-blown human level AI)
<BR>
any unfriendly prototypes can be culled from the process.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course if you keep rewriting pieces of you in a strictly Lamarckian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion, Darwin really really wants to come in through every back door
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and hole you might have overlooked.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, the seminal &lt;blush&gt; work in this regard is probably Dyson's _Darwin Among
<BR>
The Machines_, which used to be available online. Dyson and James Bailey (_After
<BR>
Thought_) mention that massively parallel neural networks show the most promise
<BR>
of evolving into human level AI. I don't particularly care how AI comes into
<BR>
being. My overriding concern relates to how and whether I'll be able to
<BR>
interface with the AI, in symbiotic brain-to-machine compatibility. (Don't
<BR>
worry, if I can ever merge with an AI, I promise to be very friendly indeed --
<BR>
depending on how rich the alliance renders my human identity.) &lt;wistful smile&gt;
