<P>EvMick, have you ever heard of a commercial class rig that was
<BR>
anything other than a deisel?  Does anyone know about fire engines?
<BR>
Those arent diesel, surely.
<BR>
<P>I have a notion about hybrid technology for an 18 wheeler.
<BR>
One could arrange electric motors at six locations, then haul a
<BR>
number of modular internal combustion-electric motor
<BR>
combinations below the cab.  I could imagine a horizontally
<BR>
opposed four cylinder engine, perhaps even air cooled, adapted
<BR>
for burning ethanol, displacement of about 1.5 liters each,
<BR>
optimized to spin about 4k RPM.  Each unit would be
<BR>
completely modular, perhaps light enough to be hoisted by two
<BR>
husky boys.  Im estimating each one would turn out about 70
<BR>
horsepower each, and weigh about 300 pounds with generator
<BR>
attached.  Undertandable units: about 50 kw and 150 kg each.
<BR>
<P>Four such engines and about 500 kw-hrs of batteries, which
<BR>
would weigh about 200 kg, and you would have a truck which
<BR>
would perhaps be slower to accelerate than your 550 hp rig,
<BR>
but would cruise the highways at 110 kph without difficulty.
<BR>
Furthermore, it would be extremely reliable, as each of the
<BR>
four i.c. engines and each of 6 electric motors would be completely
<BR>
independent.  Looks like a scheme we could get the failed
<BR>
Algore administration or the failed George W. administration
<BR>
to subsidize with tax breaks for fermentation-grade-corn growers.
