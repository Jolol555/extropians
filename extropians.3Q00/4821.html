Transparency works with IP, not against it.  Yes, you can watch David
<BR>
Brin write his next novel as it's being written.  But the police can
<BR>
see you performing an illegal observation, and arrest you for watching
<BR>
him.
<BR>
<P>If it ever makes it off the blackboard, the government can and will
<BR>
outlaw the use of transparency technology for the rest of us, on the
<BR>
grounds of &quot;privacy protection.&quot;  They'll be able to prevent us from
<BR>
watching the government by reserving the right to use transparency
<BR>
technology for itself.  We'll be able to watch them do it, if we
<BR>
decide to break the law, but they'll be able to see us doing it as
<BR>
well, and they'll have the guns and the laws to put us in jail for
<BR>
doing so.
<BR>
<P>They'll also have the access to the necessary processing power to
<BR>
identify law-breaking as it happens; or, at least, they'll have a hell
<BR>
of a lot more access to it than the rest of us will have when the
<BR>
government outlaws our use of it.
<BR>
<P>Transparency technology of all kinds makes law enforcement much much
<BR>
easier; never harder.
