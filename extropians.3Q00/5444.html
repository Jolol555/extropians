<P><EM>&gt; Don't get me wrong; I don't oppose any of the technologies being developed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I take issue only with the top level goals in some cases. Particularly, this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal of godhood leads to an arrogance which I can't condone. It leads to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believing that you know better than the other six billion people kicking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around on this planet, and that can direct actions which are not morally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supportable; for instance, the attempt to build a guardian - I haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticed any step in the plans for such creations, which involves obtaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broad consensus before &quot;flicking the switch&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>On average, as a point of fact, there is not a person on this list who
<BR>
doesn't &quot;know better&quot; than the vast majority of the world's population
<BR>
about a great many things.  I am sorry if it breaks local taboos to
<BR>
point this out. Intelligence is not distributed evenly.  
<BR>
<P>Do you actually ask for broad consensus for your own work, for every
<BR>
design and implementation decision?  No?  Is that only because what you
<BR>
are doing doesn't affect many people or is it also because most people
<BR>
wouldn't have any idea what they were talking about if they tried to
<BR>
advise you on your work?  
<BR>
<P>Should the human race only be allowed to advance in steps that were all
<BR>
approved by the broad consensus?  Should a poll have been taken before
<BR>
we allowed that the sun is the central body of the solar system rather
<BR>
than earth?  Oh, you say, we don't need to get a consensus for facts. 
<BR>
But then why do you need a consensus to bring major advances into play
<BR>
that 98% of the world's people never will understand well and that the
<BR>
majority are singularly unqualified to pass judgement upon?
<BR>
<P>I ask these things to open conversation rather than to say &quot;You are
<BR>
wrong.&quot;  I actually sympathize with some of your concern.  But I don't
<BR>
see how waiting for consensus is a sign of proper diligence or will
<BR>
actually help humanity at all.  Call it elitist if it makes you feel
<BR>
better, but I believe recognizing the paucity of intelligence is simple
<BR>
honesty. 
<BR>
<P>I also believe that failing to acknowledge one's intelligence and
<BR>
ability to help choose and produce the future can be a false modesty
<BR>
that keeps one from being fully and responsibly engaged.  Failing to
<BR>
step up and do what you can taking full responsibility is required of a
<BR>
great number of us if human beings are to have a viable, much less
<BR>
joyously abundant, future.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; This is a time of unparalleled change, and will look like a walk in the park
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next to the times to come. It is a time for humility in our approach, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special concern for the other beings that inhabit the planet; as it becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier for the few to ignore the wishes of the many, it becomes no more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tolerable to do so.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is precisely because of HUGE concern for the needs of all humanity
<BR>
that many of us became scientists and technologists and it is out of
<BR>
that concern that we dream large dreams and see to what  extent they can
<BR>
become reality. We would be irresponsible, having been gifted or having
<BR>
acquired such ability if we did not use it.
<BR>
<P>The cutting edge of any species is the edge.  It is not the consesus
<BR>
masses. Why condemn the edge for being the edge?  It is there that
<BR>
advance will happen that lifts the whole.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, we are playing with fire - well, actually fire is a baby's toy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared to the stuff we are messing with now. It's not a good time to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complacent and arrogant - &quot;we are as gods, ha ha ha!&quot;. It's time to be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humble than ever, to be open-system, to take in information from our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment. It's been discussed on the list just how dangerous some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coming technologies are (ai, nanotech, etc), and if you go over the posts,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'll see that most of the danger is attributed to use of that technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by humans infected with the God meme. People who think that they know better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than everyone else, who feel justified in producing externalities (like grey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Humility taken so far is for people who will deny their own strength AND
<BR>
their huge responsibility.  It is not a strategy that helps anyone. 
<BR>
Seeing the huge potentials for change is not something that makes me the
<BR>
least bit complacent.  It scares the heebie-jeebies out of me quite
<BR>
often.  But it is where the power and future of this species lie.  Those
<BR>
of us who are the forerunners, the intellectual scouts, the builders of
<BR>
bridges between today and tomorrow, including those of us who
<BR>
cross-check that we are keeping our wits about us, certainly cannot
<BR>
afford to be complacent.  But that doesn't mean we should stand aside or
<BR>
be frightened to look and to attempt to chart a path forward that makes
<BR>
the most sense and enables the best outcomes.  After all, if we don't
<BR>
make the attempt, then can we expect to take care of our default?  If
<BR>
not us, who?
<BR>
<P>Yes, we need as many voices and viewpoints as can be fruitfully
<BR>
employed.  Yes, we are talking about some of the most serious things
<BR>
anyone has ever contemplated and our euphoria should be tempered with
<BR>
quite a bit of sobriety.  
<BR>
<P>One thing that worries me is that we are quite good and coming up with
<BR>
technology.  We are not nearly so good at creating a unifying vision (or
<BR>
sets of visions) that will more likely shape the use and unfolding of
<BR>
the technology for the maximum good.  If we don't create a vision or set
<BR>
of positive visions to guide us then the technology will more than
<BR>
likely greatly magnify all the good and bad tendencies in the world
<BR>
today.  I doubt that that is survivable.
