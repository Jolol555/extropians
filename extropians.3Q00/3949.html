<BR>
<P>Orwellian nightmare or brave new world?
<BR>
<P>By Rachel Sylvester
<BR>
<P> 
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>MEG and Joe live in Brightlands, a secure estate protected by a siren which
<BR>
sounds whenever outsiders try to cross the barbed wire perimeter. They were
<BR>
lucky to pass the vetting procedure because Joe's tag, for a 10-year-old
<BR>
conviction, was removed only a few months ago.
<BR>
It is so unsafe to leave &quot;walled&quot; areas that they work from home, although
<BR>
their computers are linked into the company network so their bosses can
<BR>
tell exactly when they log on and off. Like all respectable citizens, Meg
<BR>
and Joe have registered ID signatures which allow them to shop on the
<BR>
internet, using &quot;virtual booths&quot; to try on clothes.
<BR>
They carry personal radar devices, which warn them if an &quot;unregistered&quot;
<BR>
individual is nearby. Their car has a government-installed breathalyser
<BR>
which cuts off the engine automatically if the driver has had a drink. They
<BR>
eat &quot;chicken in a bottle&quot;, a new animal-friendly product which allows them
<BR>
to grow their own meat at home from tissue culture. Perhaps not
<BR>
surprisingly, they drink too much.
<BR>
This is not a science fiction fantasy world, but the Government's own
<BR>
description of how Britain could look in 2020. In the analysis of the
<BR>
businessmen, academics and scientists on the Foresight panels, the internet
<BR>
will have as dramatic an impact on society as the Industrial Revolution.
<BR>
[etc]
