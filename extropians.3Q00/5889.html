<BR>
What part of &quot;phyle radiation&quot; you don't understand?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Meanwhile, we can use the fact that the AI is not homogenous to choose the most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; friendly of the bunch as replicators or parents of future generations of AI.
</EM><BR>
<P>Aaargh. The only AI that counts passes through the diversity
<BR>
bottleneck by virtue of the positive autofeedback self-enhancement
<BR>
loop. This is the factor which wipes out all other contestans. Coming
<BR>
close second, still no cigar.
<BR>
<P>Only then it radiates.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; This will, of course, insure that they remain friendly.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Of course. In your fairy-tale universe. A little bit too much is at
<BR>
stake to count on that.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Friendlies magnify friendliness by terminating unfriendlies.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Aargh^2. Only the one AI which falls into the autofeedback loop
<BR>
counts. Tell why that one shall remain friendly. And &quot;terminating&quot;
<BR>
sounds rather unfriendly to me in a coevolutionary scenario. Sounds
<BR>
like begging to have your ass kicked.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &quot;A technophobic view of the future places humans on the same highway to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; extinction [as the dinosaurs] driven there not by a cataclysmic meteor crash,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; but by the impact of robots with intelligence vastly superior to that of purely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; biological mankind.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Apart from molecular autoreplicators, that's the only technology I can
<BR>
right now think of which can really end humankind. If I'm
<BR>
&quot;technophobic&quot;, the D'Alusio is suicidal. If I have to choose between
<BR>
&quot;technophobic&quot; and &quot;suicidal&quot; I choose technophobic every time.
<BR>
<P>I like guns, but this doesn't mean I have to play russian roulette.
