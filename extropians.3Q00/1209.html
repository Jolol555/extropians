<EM>&gt;      Hardware and upload compilation will become cheap enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      profitably run uploads for lower than then-current wages when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      human labor is still highly valued (i.e., before strong AI),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      and substantially before most individuals can afford to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      non-destructively upload themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given this premise, most first uploads would be corporate projects,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and such uploads would have a first-mover advantage in filling niches.

<P>Isn't this the kind of thing that defense spends buckets of money on before
<BR>
big corporations, or at least privately and in collusion with them? I would
<BR>
think, if I were that brand of peanut which makes decisions in a defense
<BR>
department, that there would be an inestimable advantage to be gained from
<BR>
getting an edge in the uploading race. Imagine if I could get one to run on
<BR>
hardware small enough to put into those missile defense system doodads that
<BR>
Spike is a fan of? Is it likely that the corporate world would have useful
<BR>
uploads going before, say, the US DOD?
