Ken,
<BR>
<P>Before I go any further... I almost sure that we have slightly different
<BR>
concepts of the term &quot;mysticism&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I use the term to describe any epistemological framework that allows
<BR>
inclusion of intuitive or meditative insight that can be incorporated into
<BR>
an empirical model of experiential reality without prior Turing Computable
<BR>
empirical justification.
<BR>
<P>Notice, I haven't precluded screening out whole classes of insight.... just
<BR>
that such a mystical framework does not reject outright all knowledge that
<BR>
happens to be derived solely or largely  from intuition, introspection
<BR>
etc...
<BR>
<P>The mystical knowledge may well be justified by empirical hindsight.
<BR>
<P>That being said... there's lotsa grounds for mysticism in Quantum
<BR>
Mechanics... the fact that you can't easily shake the observer out of the
<BR>
paradigm... the fact that a deterministic Quantum Wave function still has to
<BR>
be mapped to physical reality via a totally probabilistic Born criterion...
<BR>
and the fact that quantum computers seem to exist.
<BR>
<P>As Henry Stapp points out; the Von Neumann formulation frankly allows a
<BR>
spiritual (ie non-material and perhaps Turing Incomputable...) side of
<BR>
things.
<BR>
<P>The Nineteeth century is over. My gosh, the Twentieth is almost washed up
<BR>
too.
<BR>
<P>We no longer exist in a Turing Computable Universe... It is possible - and
<BR>
some people like Stapp; like Sarfatti, hope to show that it is this
<BR>
component of the Universe that accounts in part for some of the computation
<BR>
that our minds perform.
<BR>
<P>Their approach is theoretico-empirical.
<BR>
<P>An empirical approach can lead to the demonstration that mystiocal knowledge
<BR>
(ie, knowledge obtained via turing incomputable processes) might exist.
<BR>
<P>But certainly, the current theoretical formulation of both QM &amp;
<BR>
Conmputational Theory encourages, rather than discourages such an outlook.

<EM>&gt;&gt; Hi extropians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; A lot of &quot;scientific&quot; sorts base their outlook on a nineteenth century
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; conceptual Universe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; By the late '20s,  of this century, Quantum Theory had introduced serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; grounds for the legitimization of mysticism in physics - and by the time
</EM><BR>
Von
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Neumann &amp; Wigner finished with it, even frank spirituality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Early in the century experiments showed that events at a sufficiently small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scale could not be modeled by classical Newtonian mechanics.  Quantum
</EM><BR>
Theory was
<BR>
<EM>&gt;developed to present a predictive model of these repeatable, but seemingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strange results.  There is no grounds for mysticism here, although
</EM><BR>
throughout
<BR>
<EM>&gt;history, lack of knowledge has been used to justify belief in the
</EM><BR>
supernatural.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Lack of knowledge provides neither support nor refutation.  Thomas
</EM><BR>
Jefferson
<BR>
<EM>&gt;wrote, &quot;Ignorance is preferable to error, and he is closer to the truth who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believes nothing than he who believes what is wrong.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Parallel with that, Church; Godel; Post &amp; Turing certainly formulated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; rigorous ideas on computability that allowed (...even encouraged, some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; say...) mysticism in our logic &amp; epistemology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They showed that non provable truths exist *outside* our logic &amp;
</EM><BR>
epistemology,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;not inside.  The fact that some non provable proposition *could* be true,
</EM><BR>
does
<BR>
<EM>&gt;you no good in trying to break the symmetry among all non-falsifiable
</EM><BR>
beliefs.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;(A symmetry which is generally broken simply by the existing beliefs of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;family one is born into.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; It is perhaps unscientific (...in a 21st century sense...) to dismiss all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mystics as Know Nothings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly some of  these folks know a great deal about their beliefs, and
</EM><BR>
it is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;scientific to try to use our reasoning to discover why they have these
</EM><BR>
beliefs.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I read the following two paragraphs from _The Meme Machine_ by Susan
</EM><BR>
Blackmore,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to a group discussing this topic at the last Foresight Senior Associates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gathering:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-    Like it or not, we are surrounded by religions.  The 'Great Faiths' of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;- world have lasted thousands of years and affect our calendars and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- holidays, our education and upbringing, our beliefs and our morality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- All over the world people spend vast amounts of time and money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- worshipping their gods and building glorious monuments in which to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- do it.  We cannot get away from religions, but using memetics we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- understand how and why they have such power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-    All the great religions of the world began as small-scale cults,
</EM><BR>
usually
<BR>
<EM>&gt;- with a charismatic leader, and over the years a few of them spread to
</EM><BR>
take
<BR>
<EM>&gt;- in billions of people all across the planet.  Imagine just how many small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- cults there must have been in the history of the world.  The question is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- why did these few survive to become the great faiths, while the vast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- majority simply died out with the death of their leader or the dispersal
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;- their few adherents?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I've known of mystical rabbis with Ph. Ds in theoretical physics and I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; met vedantic philosophers whose grasp of modern physics was breathtaking.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Good!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; There's a lot of &quot;feel-good&quot; non-reasoning behind some New Age stuff -
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; you can't dismiss the lot unless you've read them or engaged them in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; meaningful dialogue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I have. Not enough, I'm sure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bring it on, we will dialogue meaningfully.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; But there's a hell of a lot of orthodox scientific bigotry going on here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Natural, to be sure, in a Kuhnian sense... but to be kept in rein - if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; want to be good extropians.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Scientific skepticism can look like bigotry to those not used to it.  That
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;not to deny any exists.  The way you find out is to present your ideas and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;counter the objections with facts and reason.
