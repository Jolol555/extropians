<EM>&gt;     Bloom's recent book _Global Brain_ has numerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; examples of how the individual is programmed by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social organims for self-destruction in service of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; group....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Rand never accepted the naive individualistic premise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;everyone&quot; works for their self-interest.  On the contrary,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she always argued for the reality of self-sacrifice, in her view, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; primary factor in the success of tyranny.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         What confuses the issue is that any successful action,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even a self-sacrificial one results in some measure pleasure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even though vastly more substantial pains may also result
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either simultaneously or later.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the &quot;self&quot; and &quot;values&quot; are objective, then it's quite easy to see how
<BR>
their destruction can be real and not merely just a matter of arbitrarily
<BR>
labeling things as such.  One need not swallow all of Rand's philosophy or
<BR>
even all of her ethics to see this is so.  Anything which destroys one,
<BR>
where one does so willingly is self-sacrifice, right?
<BR>
<P>Also, Kant, e.g., in his _Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals_ tries to
<BR>
separate moral actions from pleasure.  Granted, this might be hard to do in
<BR>
practice, but his notion is that the good should be pursued regardless of
<BR>
its consequences, especially regardless of pleasure and happiness.  That few
<BR>
people practice this so sternly is perhaps because this view of morality is
<BR>
so antithetical to living life it can hardly be consistently practiced.
<BR>
(Why?  Well, if one consistently practices it, one will have little
<BR>
emotional feedback, one will be miserable, and, ultimately, to sacrifice
<BR>
one's self means to get rid of one's self, which means to be no more, which
<BR>
means to stop being an actor, moral or otherwise.)
