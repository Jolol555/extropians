<P>Alex, since I dont mind humiliating myself on a public forum, I will
<BR>
admit I just now figured out what crit is and what it does.  {8^D
<BR>
blush.
<BR>
<P>Please what was the link to the scriptures crit you wrote?  Being
<BR>
an atheist with formal training in Old Testament, I might be more
<BR>
useful there than on the topic of GM.  Speaking of which, Bonnie
<BR>
is kind of a pro-GM green, right?  Or did I misread her
<BR>
comments?  Or, lets see, Anders, isnt he sorta green friendly
<BR>
and simultaneously pro-tech and pro-GM?
<BR>
<P>And now that Im on the topic of greens, would not the greens
<BR>
help elect W?  My reasoning is that the greens would vote for...
<BR>
whats that cat's name?  Ralph Nader? and every vote for Ralph
<BR>
would be a vote that would have otherwise gone for algore, so
<BR>
a vote for Ralph is half a vote for Junior?
<BR>
<P>Please if this post makes little sense I hurt my back this afternoon
<BR>
working on a motorcycle and im on double pain medications and
<BR>
Im loopier than a box of cheerios.
