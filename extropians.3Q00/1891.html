<P><EM>&gt;I looked, but am disappointed in Eidolon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The promise of electronic publishing is those things it can do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that print can't do:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;1. publish non-linear stories with non-static media
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;5. publish things at a fraction of the cost one could find them in print
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I could buy a big fat physical book for $11 plus postage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well... it's also another way to vector the kinds of reading pleasures we
<BR>
already enjoy. I dislike nonlinear stories myself. Maybe I'll change when I
<BR>
see more that do work for me.
<BR>
<P>The point about the EIDOLON ish on-line is that it's almost impossible to
<BR>
get it in hardcopy at anything like that price in the States, so this is a
<BR>
window open to the curious. I myself feel that the price they're asking
<BR>
could be lowered, that they'd pick up more than twice the numbers of
<BR>
customers if they halved the asking price. Why not tell them your opinion?
<BR>
They'll surely listen to feedback.
<BR>
<P>I expect to have a couple of pieces up there in the next couple of weeks -
<BR>
one an award-winner that's been in several Year's Best anthologies, but
<BR>
still some people mightn't have seen those books; the other an unpublished
<BR>
long space opera that doesn't fit any of the standard word-lengths in
<BR>
magazines or book, and this is a good innovative venue for it.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the comments.
