<EM>&gt; &gt; Sure, but the path there is contiguous (and paved with good intentions

<EM>&gt; &gt; every step of the way). Am I now something my 3-month old former self

<EM>&gt; &gt; can't possibly comprehend? Hell, yeah. But it's still me.

<EM>&gt; Interestingly enough, you likely can't comprehend your 3-month old former
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self any better than it could you now.

<P>Actually, anyone who has a 3 year old child (or 4 year old nephew as I do), can
<BR>
rather easily recall that former self. I remember quite a bit from those days. I
<BR>
got my first model plane at that age, a rechargable electric piper, I remember
<BR>
things like my dad driving me around the Raytheon plant, sitting in the back
<BR>
seat of the car and asking my parents for a little brother. Plenty of memories,
<BR>
impressions, etc. I remember my impressions of other people that I still know
<BR>
now (its funny how people you once thought of as god-like individuals become far
<BR>
more human as you grow up.)
