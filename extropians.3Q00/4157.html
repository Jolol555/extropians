<EM>&gt; I'd lean toward the name &quot;teleoperative&quot;, which connotes a professional,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than a mindless slave. There'd need to be a code of ethics, similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to that of interpreters, of impartially handling interaction for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teleoperator, of confidentiality, all that stuff. For some tasks, you might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get right down to the job of directing the teleoperator; maybe through a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heads-up displayed arrow, which tells them which way to turn their head,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe the buzzing mentioned below, whatever.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.. I think you might end up with different classes here- kinda
<BR>
like the difference between an executive personal assistant and a temp
<BR>
who only works for you for one day or a week. An executive in a company
<BR>
might have a dedicated teleoperative they could send out on things that
<BR>
were confidential. But for other things you might go with a cheaper temp
<BR>
if that's all you needed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm interested in the state of wireless comms in the US, mainly. What's an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; affordable data rate (say using cellular networks), and what are the charges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like? How about if money was no object; what kind of bandwidth could we put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between a teleoperator on one side of the world, and a teleoperative on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends on location- inside an office building or campus you can get 10mbit
<BR>
wireless. This would have to be provided by the company or location the
<BR>
teleoperative is visiting. If they are out wandering around a location
<BR>
without that capability you have to fall back to either cellular, CDPD, or at
<BR>
most the 128kbit packet service of Metricom in a few cities. Don't expect
<BR>
usable video streaming for probably another 3 years.
<BR>
<P>However if the teleoperative stored the video onto tape, they could send
<BR>
the high quality video to you to look over later when they get back to their
<BR>
HQ.
