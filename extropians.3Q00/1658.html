It seems like there is now theoretical support for a kind of perpetual 
<BR>
motion machine. If I understand the article below, it looks like you could 
<BR>
get arbitrary amounts of work out of a thermodynamic bath by letting it 
<BR>
'warm-up' to the 4K background temperature whenever it got too cold.

<P>NEW FRONTIERS OF THERMODYNAMICS.  The science of heat
<BR>
flow might have begun in the 19th century, as a way of maximizing
<BR>
engine efficiency, but thermodynamics is still a forefront discipline,
<BR>
especially when it attempts to maximize information flow in
<BR>
computers.  Typical of the new work is a pair of articles which arrive
<BR>
at some surprising conclusions. In the first paper, Armen
<BR>
Allahverdyan of, CEA Saclay (France)/University of Amsterdam
<BR>
(Netherlands)/Yerevan Physics Institute (Armenia),
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:aarmen@spht.saclay.cea.fr?Subject=Re:%20Quantum%20Perpetual%20Motion&In-Reply-To=&lt;200007201931.e6KJVgf00393@Hydro.CAM.ORG&gt;">aarmen@spht.saclay.cea.fr</A>, and Theo Nieuwenhuizen of the
<BR>
University of Amsterdam (<A HREF="mailto:nieuwenh@wins.uva.nl?Subject=Re:%20Quantum%20Perpetual%20Motion&In-Reply-To=&lt;200007201931.e6KJVgf00393@Hydro.CAM.ORG&gt;">nieuwenh@wins.uva.nl</A>, 011-31-20-525-

6332) state that there may be a new, previously overlooked work-
<BR>
producing process in classical heat engines.  All heat engines are
<BR>
driven by a temperature difference between two reservoirs or &quot;baths.&quot; 
<BR>
Usually the hot and cold reservoirs are isolated from each other--they
<BR>
interact via an intermediary, namely the &quot;working substance&quot; such as
<BR>
a gas which receives heat from the hot bath, pushes a piston, and
<BR>
sends unused heat to the cold bath. Now, the researchers suggest
<BR>
that putting the hot and cold baths in direct contact for relatively short
<BR>
amounts of time may result in useful work, if the baths have very
<BR>
different relaxation times, the amount of time that each takes
<BR>
individually to come to thermal equilibrium.  One could accomplish
<BR>
this, for example, by putting together a very large bath and a very
<BR>
small bath.  Traditional treatments of thermodynamics assume that
<BR>
direct interactions between the hot and cold reservoirs result in the
<BR>
dissipation of energy and nothing else.  But these treatments make the
<BR>
simplifying assumption that the baths interact very feebly or for
<BR>
infinitely long times.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors show that allowing the two reservoirs to interact for
<BR>
short windows of time (relative to the time in which two reservoirs
<BR>
arrive at an equal temperature) may bring about a transfer of energy
<BR>
that can be converted to work, in cases where the final common
<BR>
temperature of the baths is lowered by their direct interaction.  If
<BR>
verified experimentally, this proposal may lead to new engine designs
<BR>
and perhaps revise estimates of the maximum efficiency of a heat
<BR>
engine.  (Physical Review Letters, 10 July 2000.)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second paper, the same research team suggests that a
<BR>
quantum particle (such as an electron) interacting strongly with a
<BR>
reservoir of particles may violate the Clausius inequality--one
<BR>
formulation of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that it
<BR>
is impossible to do work without losing heat.  What the researchers
<BR>
term &quot;appalling behavior&quot; can be traced to the quantum mechanical
<BR>
property of entanglement, in which a quantum particle (such as an
<BR>
electron) is so strongly interlinked with another particle or group of
<BR>
particles that the resulting behavior cannot be treated by standard
<BR>
thermodynamic approaches.  In this paper, the Amsterdam scientists
<BR>
study the entanglement of a particle with a &quot;quantum thermal bath,&quot; a
<BR>
reservoir of particles with which the first particle can exchange
<BR>
energy and momentum.  According to the researchers, entanglement
<BR>
prevents the quantum bath from observing the normal requirements
<BR>
for a heat bath.  Therefore, thermodynamics simply cannot say
<BR>
anything useful about the system.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard thermodynamics dictates that the bath be in thermal
<BR>
equilibrium and not interact strongly with an external object. To the
<BR>
contrary, the bath strongly interacts with something external to it (the
<BR>
entangled particle) and it cannot reach equilibrium, since it constantly
<BR>
exchanges energy and momentum with the particle.  At low
<BR>
temperatures where entanglement could be easily preserved, the
<BR>
researchers state that this system can apparently violate the Clausius
<BR>
inequality--in which the heat gained by the particle must be less than
<BR>
or equal to the temperature multiplied by the change in its entropy (or
<BR>
disorder).  Near absolute zero temperatures, a situation which would
<BR>
ordinarily require the particle to lose heat, the researchers show that
<BR>
the particle could gain heat, by the Clausius relation.  According to
<BR>
this scenario, applying a cyclic parameter such a periodically varying
<BR>
external magnetic field can cause the entangled particle to extract
<BR>
work from the bath--something forbidden in a classical system. 
<BR>
Further, the researchers say that this phenomenon could be said to
<BR>
constitute a perpetual motion machine of the second kind.  However,
<BR>
they are quick to point out that the particle can only extract
<BR>
reasonable--but not limitless--amounts of work, as the bath must
<BR>
maintain a minimum ground-state energy rather than be completely
<BR>
exhausted.  (Second paper: Phys. Rev. Lett. 7 August 2000; Select
<BR>
