<EM>&gt; arguments to that effect.

<P>I seem to recall, a while ago, (how many years?) I generated an
<BR>
argument that impressed you.  I may be mistaken.  Anyway, I'm going to
<BR>
try to churn out a convincing one.
<BR>
<P>The civil rights of anyone, say nothing of the poor, cannot be
<BR>
guaranteed.  Liberties in general can be infringed; regularly ARE
<BR>
infringed, all over the world.  We regard this to be an injustice; we
<BR>
wish we could do something about it.
<BR>
<P>In fact, the only thing that prevents the powerful at any time from
<BR>
crushing the weak is moral restraint.  Our military and police force
<BR>
maintain the vast majority of the dangerous weapoonry currently in use
<BR>
today; their members are skilled in their use.  No legal system, no
<BR>
social contract, no system of organization of any kind can prevent
<BR>
them from turning the world (or at least any given country) into a
<BR>
dictatorship.
<BR>
<P>But, you know, they don't.
<BR>
<P>Yet clearly you can see that it doesn't really matter whether they're
<BR>
formally forbidden to do so or not.  Nothing we do can guarantee them
<BR>
civil rights.
<BR>
<P>But we CAN tip the scales; we CAN make the weak more likely to have
<BR>
civil rights than not.  The easiest way to do that is by increasing
<BR>
the welfare of the poor in real terms (rather than relative terms).
<BR>
Protection is better on a larger scale; the more you pay for it, the
<BR>
more expensive it is to penetrate.  And, of course, while there will
<BR>
still be people with gobs of money who WILL be able to penetrate any
<BR>
protective measures the weak try to establish, it becomes less and
<BR>
less worthwhile to do so the richer the poor get in real terms.
<BR>
<P>Finally, look at the graphs.  The welfare of the poor in real terms is
<BR>
closely linked to the state of the economy of the whole; when GDP goes
<BR>
up, the poor find themselves better off in real terms, though usually
<BR>
not in relative terms.
<BR>
<P>Like Marx, I think politics is economic.  But I disagree with his
<BR>
interpretation.  I see our politics getting freer and freer as time
<BR>
goes on as our society gets richer and richer.  THAT'S the trend I
<BR>
see.
<BR>
<P>Libertarianism would remove some of the forced charity laws which
<BR>
are in place in most areas of the world.  This would make the poor
<BR>
worse off, at least initially.  But it would also put us on the fast
<BR>
track for economic growth (which nobody really doubts, except for
<BR>
those who think that anarcho-capitalism would turn into government).
<BR>
In real terms, many years would pass before the poor found themselves
<BR>
as well off as they were under forced charity.  But after that point,
<BR>
they would zoom far ahead of the state they would have been in had
<BR>
forced charity been in place the entire time; their &quot;guarantees&quot; for
<BR>
civil rights would grow faster, even if they did start out lower.
<BR>
<P>OK, that's it.  The poor get their civil rights by getting richer.  If
<BR>
you didn't buy it, you're not going to buy anarcho-capitalism,
<BR>
libertarianism, or whatever.
