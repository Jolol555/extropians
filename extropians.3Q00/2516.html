<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt; Jason's perspective is that this will be a disaster if we don't have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way to protect ownership of IP, and therefore we should come up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institutions today that protect the forms of IP that we have now, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that in the future we will be able to have a functioning economy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not really in favor of institutional protection in the long term, but I
<BR>
have yet to articulate exactly what I am in favor of.  More on this later.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The article by John Gilmore follows much the same reasoning, but comes to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly the opposite conclusion.  John, like Jason, sees today's threats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to IP as portending a future society where all productive efforts will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; face similar forms of piracy.  Rather than fighting this trend, though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he seeks ways to live with it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see the 'trend' as entropy, and, yes, I do think we should fight it.
<BR>
<P>But the way I want to fight it involves using it, which means there may be
<BR>
points of commonality between John's philosophy and my own.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; His experience no doubt teaches him that you *can* make money off of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software which is given away for free; the millions of dollars in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bank account attest to that.
</EM><BR>
<P>And clearly he won't be the last to make lots of money off of these sorts of
<BR>
new business models.  But I believe the ways in which people make money off
<BR>
of free software are available to them (increasingly!) in world with 'not'
<BR>
free software.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;    Intellectual property law, and expected business practice, is being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    driven by the entertainment middleman industry in exactly the wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    direction: Artificially restricting computers and citizens so that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    will not make the copies that they are very good at making.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, well I've never been a big fan of most uses of the words 'artificial'
<BR>
and 'natural.'  I'm an advocate of creating a new form of 'smart'
<BR>
information that is not only data, but meta-data... that is to say, it
<BR>
contains rules that govern it's own behavior... if that's 'artificial,' then
<BR>
so be it.  If we need to create a social contract to protect information
<BR>
until we get there, then I can probably go along with that too.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Following
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    this path will lead the economy to a massive dislocation (much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    bigger than the record companies' dismay about Napster and MP3 --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    record companies' sales today are greater than ever). Almost nobody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    understands this yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>I try to avoid strong predictive statements because I'm all too aware of how
<BR>
superfluid the next ten years are going to be.  IMO we don't have good
<BR>
benchmarks by which to make statements like &quot;following this path will lead
<BR>
the economy to a massive dislocation.&quot;  (And actually, I'm not quite sure
<BR>
what that means...)  However, I'll grant that it ain't much fun if we don't
<BR>
get to take a few stabs in the dark... so on!
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The solution he sees is to move society towards acceptance of the open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source philosophy in all areas of human endeavor.  Only in that way can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we move into a nanotech economy without a crash, and allowing everyone to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; share in the fruits of the new technology:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    If even a third or a half of the economy is running on open source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    principles before assemblers start assembling more assemblers, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    can probably avoid war and worldwide civil unrest.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow.  Now we're gettin' into the big stuff.  Okay, well let me try to
<BR>
articulate a contrary viewpoint.
<BR>
<P>This isn't fully formed yet folks,  so I hope a few broad strokes will
<BR>
suffice:
<BR>
<P><P><P>For a moment, lets empty our heads of some of the commonly held beliefs with
<BR>
regards to information in the Internet age: foremost, the idea that
<BR>
&quot;information wants to be free,&quot; but also the whole realm of wide-eyed dotcom
<BR>
day-dreamiery: free, anonymous, infinitely self-replicating, frictionless
<BR>
information.  I would call this sort of information &quot;dumb, nameless,
<BR>
randomly replicating information with no rules.&quot;  Let's refer to it as
<BR>
Dinfo.  (dumb info)
<BR>
<P>Lets consider instead a nearly antithetical type of information: smart,
<BR>
named, intelligently replicating information with rules.  Information that
<BR>
knows who made it.  Information that can be inherently possessed of rules.
<BR>
Sinfo.
<BR>
<P>Let's forget for a moment that proper Sinfo requires technology that we
<BR>
don't currently have yet-- let's instead just sit back and play a mind game
<BR>
with Dinfo and Sinfo.
<BR>
<P>At first glance the biological parallel to Dinfo is cancer, whereas Sinfo
<BR>
seems to have some strong correlation to the gene.  To be more precise:
<BR>
cancer replicates uncontrollably without good feedback mechanisms to control
<BR>
its behavior, whereas the gene has some very specific rules about how it can
<BR>
multiply, with what it can interact, and to &quot;whom&quot; it belongs.
<BR>
<P>Cancer clearly is the master of unrestrained growth.  The gene, on the other
<BR>
hand, must make use of a tremendously complicated higher order emergent
<BR>
system in order to perpetuate itself.  It follows an exceedingly intricate
<BR>
and precise set of instructions in order to develop a complex adaptive
<BR>
vehicle for itself: life.
<BR>
<P>Without straining the analogy further, the point is simply this: rules +
<BR>
complexity + selection pressure = emergence.  Unrestrained growth is a
<BR>
negative attractor state-- one into which I fear we are being rapidly drawn.
<BR>
<P>Okay, okay, like I said, this is just going to be some broad strokes, so let
<BR>
me move in a slightly different direction.
<BR>
<P>Sinfo knows who made it.  It knows where its been.  Copies may be
<BR>
functionally indentical, but -they- &quot;know&quot; they're different.  Some of it
<BR>
follows rules.  Some of the rules are extremely complicated: On Thursday you
<BR>
can hang out with Bob's Sinfo, but on Friday you have a son and then commit
<BR>
suicide.  Some Sinfo lets you copy it indefintely.  Some you can only copy
<BR>
once, some not at all.
<BR>
<P>When you build Sinfo you can make it as free or as &quot;owned&quot; as you want.  You
<BR>
are empowered to create information with a legacy, that knows that you made
<BR>
it, that won't let anyone else copy it precisely, and you can free it into
<BR>
the environment to prosper or perish.
<BR>
<P>Now, I think there's a whole realm of inherent advantages to this model, but
<BR>
I'm not going to get into all of them here, 'cause that's a whole book
<BR>
folks.  We've discussed some of the big issues already on this list.  But I
<BR>
do want to point out what I consider to be one of the biggest pluses to
<BR>
Sinfo:
<BR>
<P>You can write yourself into it.
<BR>
<P>I know that this is the kiss of death for the &quot;information wants to be free&quot;
<BR>
advocates, and it's the precise reason why I am not among that group:  Even
<BR>
if totally free information is wildly successful (especially if!) the bad
<BR>
consequence is that it doesn't care about it's creator.  We would live in a
<BR>
state of making superficial use of the massive information network that has
<BR>
coelesced around us, unable to control or affect it, passive bystanders to
<BR>
an ongoing process that may very well write its own rules eventually (become
<BR>
Sinfo!) and just simply evolve past us.  A robust undiscipled cancer.
<BR>
<P>Optionally, we hardcode ourselves into the information-- in fact, we make
<BR>
the &quot;smartness&quot; fundamental to the information.  Every thought that comes
<BR>
out of your brain becomes an extension of you, as opposed to an anonymous
<BR>
dust mote in the cyclone.  The system that is the &quot;creator&quot; becomes
<BR>
inextricably linked to the data that is the &quot;created.&quot;  Widespread
<BR>
empowerment of ideas in the frictionless matricies of the future give you
<BR>
exposure to limitless designer ideas, with a direct positive feedback loop
<BR>
to the &quot;creator&quot; based upon your successful use of the &quot;created.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In the attention economy, you probably won't want to prevent copying of your
<BR>
information, even if you could-- you get 'paid' everytime someone takes a
<BR>
look.  But maybe some uncopiable Sinfo swirls around the matrix-- absolutely
<BR>
precious, diamond sharp and outrageously valuable.  If you have to work hard
<BR>
to get it, then...*you'll work hard to get it!*  It won't be free or easy or
<BR>
infinite but will instead require considerable innovation on your part to
<BR>
procure.
<BR>
<P>Okay, well it's obvious I could on (and on, and on...)
<BR>
<P>The primary objection to Sinfo is likely to be on grounds of practicality.
<BR>
(Think of all the overhead...!)  But I'd argue that its worth all the
<BR>
overhead... all that meta-data that appears to be slowing the information
<BR>
down is actually integral to all sorts of emergent success.  Kind of like
<BR>
the government.  :)
<BR>
<P>This does mean that we have to give up some control, in favor of interesting
<BR>
rules.  And if the technology isn't good enough to make those rules work,
<BR>
then, again, yep, I am in favor of social engineering to make it happen.
<BR>
<P>But I really don't think the technology is impossible.  I really don't.  I
<BR>
actually do think that the gene is a good example of a working model.  The
<BR>
gene is really just information-- written into a less plastic substrate:
<BR>
physical reality.  I'd like to copy and improve upon its success in the
<BR>
media of the future.
<BR>
<P>But maybe I'll do that tomorrow, 'cause right now I gotta go to sleep.
<BR>
<P>Night all.
