<EM>&gt; (Of course, for &quot;product&quot; you can substitute any source of financial

<EM>&gt; profit.  For instance, if you can think of a service that only you can

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would be an early-stage-useful target for your research.)

<EM>&gt; The key here is not to do everything at once.  Go for something you know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can do, then build on that, and you just might have a chance.

<P>Absolutely; I agree. I think my point is that genetic programming may not
<BR>
quite be the best place to start looking for a short term profit, perhaps
<BR>
unless you are a current world leader in the field who has some really
<BR>
knock-out idea. I'm not and I don't.
<BR>
<P>I do have a damned good idea in the teleworking arena, however. Any aussie
<BR>
coders out there looking for the opportunity to telework to the US at some
<BR>
point in the future, maybe interested in turning their careers in that
<BR>
direction? Drop me a line privately.
