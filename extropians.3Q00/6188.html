<EM>&gt; &gt;In 5th grade, I was once paddled for being mugged.  In high school
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;our class valedictorian was expelled for two weeks for being the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;victim of a totally unprovoked attack (both long stories).  spike

<EM>&gt; cynical about

<EM>&gt; authority.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.  Some jerk started roughing me and said he would leave me alone
<BR>
for a quarter.  So *technically* it was a mugging.  Just as he said it, the
<BR>
girl's PE teacher came out of her office, about 10 meters behind him.  So
<BR>
I figured I was safe, mouthed off to him, loudly, and he jumped me, not
<BR>
knowing she was back there.  She pulled him off me, so far so good, but
<BR>
then she took us both to the guys PE coach and said &quot;These two boys
<BR>
were fighting,&quot; and immediately turned and walked out!  I said &quot;No coach,
<BR>
not 'these two boys were fighting.'  I was the victim of an unprovoked
<BR>
attack and I expect that this criminal to be punished!&quot;  He said,
<BR>
&quot;Uhhh, right, councelor.  Elbows on the desk.&quot;  Whack^3.  So I was
<BR>
paddled for being mugged.
<BR>
<P>Six years later, my best friend was the class valedictorian.  He was a big
<BR>
liberty-and-justice-for-all type crusader.  This was when we were seniors
<BR>
in the spring of 1978, in Florida.
<BR>
<P>At lunch we were discussing the fact that at one time there were separate
<BR>
restrooms for white and black, and now they were all integrated
<BR>
except one, which was, oddly enough, black only.  He objected,
<BR>
saying that all restrooms were for everyone, and to demonstrate,
<BR>
he would go into the black restroom.  We all called out Noooooo
<BR>
but he went and did it.  He went thru the first door of two, but
<BR>
before he could go inside the second door, he was jumped by
<BR>
a girl!  She jumped on his back!  I swear Im not making any of
<BR>
this up.  He staggered back out into the crowded lunchroom with
<BR>
this girl on his back, choking him.  He managed to throw her off,
<BR>
and she began to run away but was apprehended.
<BR>
<P>What happened next was even more bizarre.  This attack was
<BR>
clearly unprovoked, about 400 eye witnesses.  The principal
<BR>
realized what a powder keg he was sitting upon.  One would
<BR>
think he would just call the police, have them haul off the
<BR>
perp, the valedictorian would return to class, all is settled.
<BR>
But then the black students might claim racial discrimination,
<BR>
and the tension would increase, so the principal asked him
<BR>
if he would accept a two week suspension.  He said no, for
<BR>
he would lose his valedictorian status, and that he would call
<BR>
in legal authorities if necessary.  So the principal looked
<BR>
deep into his eyes and said, &quot;If I seeeeee to it that your class
<BR>
stannndinnnnng does not sufferrrrrr, thennnn will you accept
<BR>
a two week suspension?&quot;  My friend said, &quot;Sir, if you can
<BR>
guaranteeeee my class stannnnnding, then yes.&quot;
<BR>
<P>What the principal didnt realize was that our valedictorian
<BR>
would have lost his standing anyway.  He and I were in
<BR>
calculus together, and I knew he wasnt getting it.  I know, for
<BR>
we studied together.  He was an excellent student, but calculus
<BR>
just shot him down dead in his tracks.  He would be lucky to get
<BR>
a C, after nearly 4 years of 4.0 average.  That C would put
<BR>
him down in 5th spot, out of the medals.  He accepted the
<BR>
deal, the principal called in all my friend's teachers, told them
<BR>
the whole story.  He graduated a month later with a perfect 4.
<BR>
<P>So.  He got two weeks suspension for being the victim
<BR>
of an unprovoked attack.  The rest of the story is that
<BR>
he ended up with a full scholarship.  Reliable rumor had it he
<BR>
was a millionaire thrice over by the time we had our ten year
<BR>
reunion.  All I got for being mugged is a sore ass.  {8-[  spike
