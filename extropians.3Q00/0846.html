</EM><BR>
<P><P>They can only help if they can survive, which means they need a way to make

money. I'm not a terribly big fan of all things big &amp; commercial; however,
<BR>
this copyright issue will cut to all levels. How does anyone make money if
<BR>
everything can be pirated so fantastically well? One of the interesting
<BR>
things is ease of distribution of pirated copy vs legit copy; it becomes
<BR>
*easier* to download the pirated version than it is to bother with buying
<BR>
the legit version, because you don't have to work out how to pay (one of the
<BR>
main reasons the web is still about free stuff is because it is too hard for
<BR>
people to pay, irrespective of whether they have the money).
<BR>
<P>If no one can make a return on investment, there will be no investment.
<BR>
There will be no quality recordings; just what we can scratch together in
<BR>
our basements, out of love. I am as seduced by this &quot;f*ck the record
<BR>
industry&quot; stuff as the next guy, but there needs to be some balance.
<BR>
<P>Or we need a major economic/political overhaul, to cope with information
<BR>
being free. Which would be a good thing, but hard.
<BR>
<P>Either way, given that we currently live in a capitalist system, and people
<BR>
need to get paid for doing things, this wholesale piracy is not some kind of
<BR>
lovely grassroots anarchy; it's stealing stuff. More like looting, really.
<BR>
<P>Reminds me of &quot;socialist&quot; friends I've had in the past; they started
<BR>
stealing things (bricks and mortar stuff), and found they could get away
<BR>
with it. So they spouted more socialist rhetoric, and stole more stuff. Marx
<BR>
said that economic structures(basic ownership) dictates social structure,
<BR>
which dictates ideology; ironic really. I don't think he really advocated
<BR>
just going around taking things (or maybe he did? bloody revolution and all
<BR>
that). Anyway, these kinds of people you can do without; the rhetoric covers
<BR>
an intense selfishness. I hope the meme that it is morally right to get
<BR>
pirated stuff doesn't take the hold that I think it is going to; it's a
<BR>
morally bankrupt position.
<BR>
<P>As a musician, if you want to promote information freedom, then give away
<BR>
your work. I do (some of it, anyway). If you believe that the record
<BR>
industry can be toppled by this kind of grassroots action, then this kind of
<BR>
thing should be enough to do it; together, we can outcompete them. However,
<BR>
stealing people's work is an entirely different matter.
<BR>
<P>For the record, I don't think the record industry will be toppled any time
<BR>
soon by this kind of action. If anything, they'll get stronger. They have an
<BR>
essential function of promotion; they tell the masses what to buy. This is
<BR>
in no way undermined by distribution costs shrinking toward zero by way of
<BR>
the net. Promotion costs are still just as high as ever. If anything, the
<BR>
market for the american record companies has become bigger; local industries
<BR>
in other countries is going to suffer, but the big guys will keep cultural
<BR>
colonisation alive and well. Now if I owned a distribution company, or a
<BR>
chain of record stores, I'd be sweating. Or is that whole industry vertical,
<BR>
and the big record companies can just back out of shopfronts gracefully and
<BR>
step into websites?
<BR>
<P>(hmmm, almost spelled colonisation with a Z)
