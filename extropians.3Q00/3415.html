If cancer is a natural cap on lifespan, normally beaten to death by heart disease, organ
<BR>
failure, or accident, then it is perhaps inextricably linked with that old cycle of doing
<BR>
out with the old to make way for the new.
<BR>
<P>The forest fires are not so different, they are dangerous and have burned large areas of
<BR>
timber, and I know not any expressible capital amount of damage the fires have caused,
<BR>
although I think it little except for the very real hundreds of people who have lost
<BR>
homes.
<BR>
<P>One good thing about the forest fires is that when the fires kick off again in the next
<BR>
ten years, there will have been some burns already cleared, although they must be kept
<BR>
free of secondary undergrowth which is too flammable, and thus by having been burned then
<BR>
they will not burn and the firefighters can concentrate on Southern California.
<BR>
<P>Now, when we can determine good ways to ship the floods and hurricanes of the Atlantic
<BR>
directly to these parched areas, then people will still talk about the weather.
<BR>
<P>Speaking of the weather, perhaps I am just too young to have seen cycles of fifty or a
<BR>
hundred years and certainly of millenia, but the evidence I have seen from the
<BR>
meterologists is that humans and their activites which affect the environment have done
<BR>
so in a way that can not be easily reversed.  This environmental change (remember global
<BR>
warming and the Ozone Layer and threat of lack of a one),  can only be slowed by
<BR>
converting all the cars to fuels that burn to emit water and not CO2, CO, and nitrogen
<BR>
and sulphur compounds we find in the air as we burn billions of pounds of ancient
<BR>
fermented plankton, or the blood, or perhaps a humour, of the Earth.  Reversing it
<BR>
requires letting the environment recover, and probably not yet massive industrial
<BR>
planetary-wide air cleaners.  That is to say:  may we never have to terraform the Earth.
<BR>
<P>The cycle is a simple one:  use solar energy to generate electricity and split water into
<BR>
hydrogen and oxygen, and burn it back for internal combustion needs.  Burning alcohol
<BR>
from sustainable biomass is certainly a much better proposition for the environment which
<BR>
many hope to inhabit indefinitely than is burning petro-sludge and particularly coal.
<BR>
<P>There are environmental realities about these environmental impacts:  people who mine,
<BR>
sell, and burn coal want to keep doing so to make money, thus the planet wheezes and
<BR>
burns in the sun.
<BR>
<P>Here's one for you:  almost each person on the planet breathes the same air.  So, if the
<BR>
air is damaged, then each has been damaged.  Pow!  Class action suit, no more money in
<BR>
coal.

<EM>&gt; In aging humans tumors tend to appear in epithelial tissue. Because of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lack of telomerase, when telomeres have been used up, cell division leads to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; massive chromosomal damage. These cells enter a state called 'crisis'. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they then regain the ability to make telomerase, these genetically damaged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells move toward a cancerous state.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Normal mice produce telomerase in the epithelial tissues. Although they get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other kinds of cancers, they don't develop cancers like those seen in aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans. When knockout mice were created that did not produce telomerase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the epithelial tissues, they exhibited cancer development like that seen in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aging humans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This strikes me as very good news. It appears that the 'dark side' of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telomerase is manifested only when cells regain telomerase after having been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previously damaged by its absence. That seems to brighten considerably the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prospect of using telomerase as a component in an anti-aging therapy.
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;                                                                         Don Klemencic
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From readings here and some elsewhere, it is certain that telomerase is a kew in the
</EM><BR>
aging process.  What biological processes maintain telomeres I know not, but it happens.
<BR>
This is a fantastic statement, but in twenty years everyone on the planet could be free
<BR>
of what was priorly the natural age limit, perhaps barring brain cell disintegration.  Of
<BR>
course, there would still be a limit.
