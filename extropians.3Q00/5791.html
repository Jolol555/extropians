<EM>&gt; How to bring up this point?  I know I'm not the only one to wonder this, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here goes...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is the core idea of Extropy (as I understand it, summarized by &quot;Upward and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Outward&quot;) predicated on a libertarian philosophy?  Does one have to accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the other excess baggage that comes with libertarianism (i.e. absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom to own and use firearms, no centralized legal systems, decentralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or no environmental regulations, no public investment from non-private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizations, etc.) to be a true extropian?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I ask this question as a believer in the concepts of expanding beyond what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are accepted as &quot;common&quot; limitations - overcoming such barriers as aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pathologies and death, limitations of the physical body (strength, endurance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.), limitations of input bandwidth and storage, gravity wells, the speed of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light...  All of these things that we can and SHOULD overcome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not, and cannot, accept the fundamental assumptions that seem to underly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarianism - the axioms, often implicit, are ones I cannot accept, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as I cannot accept the axioms that underly Christianity or Scientology.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can accept an dsympathize with many of the ideas underlying the political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy, and am at least friendly to most.  My issues are those of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation - the practical questions that need to be answered before a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political philosophy becomes a political system.  That having been said,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I need to ask this in plain language:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is everyone out there on this list a libertarian, or is that just the air this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list puts forward?  Because if that's the cost of entry...  I don't know if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can continue to provide constructive input into a discussion where I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buy into the same basic assumptions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>For someone who cares deeply about political principles and positions
<BR>
you managed to broadly tar what you call &quot;Libertarianism&quot; without saying
<BR>
hardly a thing about what sort of politics you do hold much less why you
<BR>
are convinced it is better and more beneficial than this bunch of
<BR>
notions you loosely label &quot;Libertarian&quot;.  I find that quite curious.  I
<BR>
would be interested in a talk about general political philosophy and
<BR>
relative merits and demerits of different systems with some level of
<BR>
agreement about how the different systems are defined and
<BR>
distinguished.  But just ragging on one or another of them and
<BR>
threatening to take your ball and go away if this &quot;is the cost of entry&quot;
<BR>
is pointless.  In the first place, Libertarians are a pretty diverse
<BR>
bunch.  In the second place, the list of things at the front of your
<BR>
post is not held in utterly unqualified form by many on this list.  In
<BR>
the third place I am not very interested in conversations that require
<BR>
me to buy into a bunch of assumptions up front either, including yours.
