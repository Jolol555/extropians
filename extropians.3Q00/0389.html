Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;I've got another question, why don't reptilians or amphibians show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;widespread aging?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They do show widespread aging.
</EM><BR>
<P>Reference? I've seen a few papers identifying aging changes (not increased
<BR>
mortality with age) in reptilians and amphibians with average lifespans of
<BR>
a few of years. However, many turles, salamanders, crocodiles and
<BR>
alligators, bullfrogs, and snakes do not show signs of aging and yet live
<BR>
on average as much as ducks, horses, or cows.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The only sexual species for which I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ever seen a &quot;non-aging&quot; claim are extremely long-lived ones like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lobsters.  Even with those species, there's a problem with catch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;records.  If they didn't age, we should find some 200-year old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lobsters; but we don't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just a detail: it's very difficul to determine the age of a lobster.
<BR>
Second, Marion's tortoise shows increased mortality after 60 in the wild;
<BR>
but not in captivity where it can live well beyond a century. This suggests
<BR>
extrinsic factors as the cause of aging (continually growing species can
<BR>
have their mortality increased due to increased predations or change in
<BR>
diet because they are growing too big -- I have references showing this.)
<BR>
Also, what you call &quot;extremely long-lived ones&quot; are species that have
<BR>
average lifespans in the range of whales and elephants. So why whales and
<BR>
elephants age but not lobsters, or rockfishes, or tortoises? (remember they
<BR>
have the same mortality rates).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Even species such as Desmognathus that live less than 15
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;years do not show signs of increased mortality with age (in fact, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;show decreased mortality after adulthood is reached).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Do you have a cite for this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Finch's &quot;Longevity, Senescence, and the Genome&quot;, pag 219.
<BR>
<P>Hasta.
