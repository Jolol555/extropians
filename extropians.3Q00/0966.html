<P><EM>&gt; Or not. Actually, I agree quite strongly with you on this Lee; information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be free. But I think this is only half the picture, because I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything should be free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seriously. To be more precise, I think that ownership is a seriously flawed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concept that damages freedom, and has created the massively unjust world in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which we now live, with a small minority of people making up the very rich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (that's us westerners), and the large majority of people belonging to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legions of the mindnumbingly, incomprehensibly poor. This, because people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own things, which means that others in turn are excluded from their use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I can see evolutionary reasons for the rise of the concept of ownership.
<BR>
Not to mention that it becomes very difficult for you to use something
<BR>
when I'm in the process of using it...yes, some ugly little scuffles
<BR>
would most likely be the quickly realized default.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I detailed in a recent post one idea for a future market economy which did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not include a concept of ownership (or more correctly, included the concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that everyone owns everything). In that scenario, I would have absolutely no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem with taking away copyright; it becomes meaningless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
This is very interesting. When you say everything, do you also include
<BR>
semi- and sentient objects/collections of matter/energy? Why or why not?
<BR>
<P>Do you think it's possible to convert from a capitalist/property
<BR>
ownership system to your idea of an all-owner economy? Or, is that
<BR>
something that probably would have to have been started from the
<BR>
beginning of civilization?
<BR>
<P>If you wouldn't mind Emlyn, could you please repost your idea, or you
<BR>
can send it to me directly if you feel it would be unnecessary clutter
<BR>
for the list in general. Thanks.
