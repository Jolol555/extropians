<P>
Jodie, my darling wife and partner in crime (err, a respectable business
<BR>
venture, in any case), has been putting some legwork into looking at social
<BR>
trends in the near future. It's interesting stuff, and pertains to what's
<BR>
been discussed regarding people's values with respect to technology &amp; the
<BR>
future. The stuff I've posted here is from an Australian perspective, but is
<BR>
likely to be relatively close to what's going on in the rest of the first
<BR>
world.
<BR>
<P>She made some notes a while back, which are very much in a draft, internal
<BR>
use only kind of form. However, being a lazy boy, I've just stuck them in as
<BR>
is. They're a good read anyway.

<P>**************
<BR>
<EM>&gt;From the book
</EM><BR>
Turning Point
<BR>
by Hugh Mackay
<BR>
on how people perceive the changes to technology .
<BR>
<P>p. 237 - p. 250
<BR>
Australians are big into techno gadgets, eg internet (18% of households now
<BR>
connected)
<BR>
but
<BR>
many are unsure about the long term benefits to themselves, their family,
<BR>
and society. Technology stimulates fear, mistrust and anxiety.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Computers, technology and the future
</EM><BR>
A recurring theme.is that society will become depersonalized, that people
<BR>
and groups will be alienated from each other, and that life will become
<BR>
emotionally colder. These fears depend upon the idea of machines coming to
<BR>
dominate people in a way not thought to have occurred previously.People feel
<BR>
that the future holds technological innovations which are in some way more
<BR>
complex and more persuasive than we have previously seen. It is this
<BR>
prospect which is frightening and which leads to the idea of a diminution of
<BR>
the significance of human beings themselves.
<BR>
<P>Technology depersonalising society
<BR>
Communication implications
<BR>
people being replaced by machines in the workplace, eg ATMs. Uproar about
<BR>
train conductors being replaced, in Melbourne.
<BR>
impact on quality of family time -children becoming more isolated from their
<BR>
parents. Parents worry about other implications for their children such as
<BR>
suffering social skills, health impacts and personality changes, ie
<BR>
expecting instant gratification and loss of ability to amuse themselves.
<BR>
loss of face to face communication through overuse of email and mobile
<BR>
phones.
<BR>
Fear of an attitude of 'technological determinism' which removes
<BR>
consideration of human values from the process of technological development.
<BR>
Also many Australians love technology but are also aware of negative
<BR>
implications for personal relationships.
<BR>
Technology and Unemployment
<BR>
Most Australians see positive, causal relationship.
<BR>
Mr Mackay proposes that this points at a deeper fear people have of
<BR>
unknowable change. &quot;When people complain that new technology costs jobs,
<BR>
they may be airing a deeper fear, the fear that new technology changes our
<BR>
lives in all kinds of ways that we can't always anticipate - some good, some
<BR>
bad: look at the motor car.&quot; p 243
<BR>
<P>Technology and Privacy
<BR>
&quot;particularly in the banking market, and in areas where government
<BR>
departments store information about us, people are becoming increasingly
<BR>
aware of the possibility of all kinds of sharing and transferring of this
<BR>
data. Sometimes their fears are based on deliberate decisions to spread date
<BR>
around: sometimes they fear less legal access to private and sensitive
<BR>
information.&quot;
<BR>
Loss of anonymity through the internet. People have a vague sense of anxiety
<BR>
that 'nothing is really secure&quot; once information is put into a vast
<BR>
electronic network.
<BR>
On the other hand, there are concerns about lack of source credibility and
<BR>
reliability. Is the person you are emailing who they say they are?
<BR>
Fears of exposure to the &quot;dark side of humanity&quot; through the internet.
<BR>
People are concerned about how technology is furthering their dependence on
<BR>
credit.
<BR>
Is technology just promoted consumerism pushed down people's throats? Will
<BR>
there be a gap between the info rich and the info poor?
<BR>
Currently only dim awareness of the future importance of non computing
<BR>
technologies (he was referring to genetic engineering) and related level of
<BR>
fear at present.
<BR>
&quot;We know there is an ethical minefield out there, waiting for our
<BR>
understanding to catch up with the experimental work being done.&quot;
<BR>
<P>John Gray, London school of economics
<BR>
&quot; The dream that technology serves is a dream of complete control. It's a
<BR>
dream with ancient sources in Western traditions. It's the dream that we can
<BR>
cease to be mortal, earth-bound creatures subject to fate and chance. It's a
<BR>
product not so much of science as of magic. The project of using technology
<BR>
to remake the world according to our will captures the fantasy by which we
<BR>
have been ruled during much of the 20th century. It is a fantasy of progress
<BR>
without instability.&quot;
<BR>
<P>**************
<BR>
Summarising the Millenium Edge by the lovely Noel Turnbull
<BR>
<P>p. 15 generation MM : &quot;having values, being a committed and responsible
<BR>
member of the community; communicating through dialogue rather than
<BR>
didactically; and learning that in the millennium perceptions count as much
<BR>
as performance.&quot;
<BR>
<P>16 Significant sections of the world's population think that the world will
<BR>
end or be totally transformed at any moment. Diverse groups with very
<BR>
different agenda for eg. religious fundamentalists and extreme radical
<BR>
environmentalists.
<BR>
<P>18 in modern society &quot;myth, fiction, images and reality all get confused to
<BR>
the extent that it is very often difficult to tell which is which.&quot;
<BR>
<P>19 growing tension between globalism and localism. 20 &quot;the more global the
<BR>
world becomes the more possible it is for smaller communities to be both
<BR>
politcally and geographically separate while still being part of the wider
<BR>
world.&quot;
<BR>
<P>20&quot; ...the human response to change. Change and uncertainty unsettle the
<BR>
vast majority of people. They become frightened and apprehensive. The more
<BR>
change the more fear, and the more fear the more people become alienated and
<BR>
despairing. The greater the despair and the alienation the greater the
<BR>
desire to develop a sense of belonging and security. Thus, as the world
<BR>
becomes more global, the more important it becomes for individuals to define
<BR>
themselves in terms of place, family and community.&quot;
<BR>
<P>22. Gen MM will not be scared of technology, it will be a standard part of
<BR>
their lives, but they will yearn for wilderness and simplicity. 23 Little
<BR>
interest in history, high level of environmental awareness, but not be
<BR>
enviro-fundys, used to economic insecurity and change, principally oriented,
<BR>
balance and value will be important to them, respect minorities and gender
<BR>
equality, moderate in much that they do, will look for quality, absorbed a
<BR>
spiritual element.
<BR>
<P>25. &quot;the world will seem threatening and irrational.&quot;
<BR>
<P>30 &quot;Religious fundamentalism is here.&quot; 31 U.S. 70% people believe in the
<BR>
devil. 40% people believe a nuclear fire will bring Armageddon. Rise of New
<BR>
Age stuff also.
<BR>
<P>39. &quot;Myth will merge into reality. if we fail to recognise that - and assume
<BR>
that everyone is rational, or able to distinguish between myth and reality -
<BR>
we will fail to understand what is really happening&quot;
<BR>
<P>42 Communication skills will change
<BR>
<P>46. more people will own dogs.
<BR>
<P>47 Science is again battling superstition. Anti technology feelings, in
<BR>
large minority of population. ( eg 40% of US want to put limits on techno
<BR>
development.)
<BR>
<P>51. Environmentalism will continue to be important.
<BR>
<P>63. The need for interpersonal communication will not go away.
<BR>
Politics
<BR>
<P>65. Gen mm to be more involved in local politics, understand that national
<BR>
governments have less and less real power, and lobby for devolution.
<BR>
<P>76. Feelings of nationalism will continue to be important, but the
<BR>
boundaries of &quot;nation&quot; will get smaller and smaller. Economic independence
<BR>
is a thing of the past, cultural nationalism is the thing of the future.
<BR>
<P>77. rejection of materialism, development of community awareness, and more
<BR>
towards democratic socialism in terms of public services, welfare etc.
<BR>
<P>91 Gen MM values - trust cohesion stakeholding
<BR>
<P>83 a coming Asian century
<BR>
<P>87. Knowledge will be the most valuable commodity in the world. Gen mm will
<BR>
spend time in life long learning.
<BR>
<P>94. US people rate the microwave as the most important technological change
<BR>
in the last 25 years. Time represents freedom - technology that saves time
<BR>
in their daily lives impresses people. People are generally not impressed by
<BR>
technology unless it improves their daily lives. Future technology is
<BR>
extremely uncertain.
<BR>
<P>104 &quot;a gigantic explosion in demand for the products and services from the
<BR>
cultural industries.&quot;
<BR>
<P>106 symmetrical two way communication will become paramount - people will
<BR>
crave to be listened to.
<BR>
<P>108 trust of message source will become even more important - word of mouth
<BR>
especially.
<BR>
<P>116 Dads - middle aged middle class men in suits are bumbling buffoons.
<BR>
&quot;Fathers don't know the answers to homework questions. Fathers can't fix the
<BR>
washing machine. Fathers get lost on outings in the car and are too stubborn
<BR>
to ask for directions. Fathers can't cook a meal without wrecking the
<BR>
kitchen. Yet here - on television screens around the world - were a flock of
<BR>
fathers saying the planet was safe, there was no environmental risk, and we
<BR>
really just had to have some faith. They were saying &quot;We don't need to stop
<BR>
and ask for directions, because I'm sure if we just go down here we'll get
<BR>
back on the right road soon.&quot; Work dress codes will become more casual.
<BR>
<P>121 21stc - &quot;millions and millions more people with more disposable income
<BR>
than ever before.&quot;
<BR>
<P>128 Database records of customers for good interactive communication,
<BR>
tempered with increased demands for privacy
<BR>
<P>135 Brands will continue to be important, become more important, but
<BR>
customers will be looking for values as well as value. Brand will need to
<BR>
personify philanthropy, environmental awareness, and community awareness,
<BR>
demonstrating that they are doing good in the community.
<BR>
<P>140 Value is more important than price.
<BR>
<P>142 regulation means the government is doing your issues management for
<BR>
you.''
<BR>
<P>143 value, trust, trustworthiness, co-operation and dialogue
<BR>
<P>156 the days of the victory metaphor are over. Just concentrate on your
<BR>
customers, be most excellent and get away from competition mindset.
