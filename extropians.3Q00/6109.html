NASA CREATES NEW ENTERPRISE FOCUSING ON BIOLOGY
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA today announced a restructuring of the Office of Life 
<BR>
and Microgravity Sciences and Applications (OLSMA) to strengthen 
<BR>
the agency¹s ability to meet the challenges brought about by the 
<BR>
growth in areas such as molecular biology, nanotechnology, 
<BR>
information technology and genomics. 
<BR>
<P>The reorganization is consistent with NASA Administrator Daniel S. 
<BR>
Goldin's vision to create an interdisciplinary research program 
<BR>
focused on biology, bringing together physics, chemistry, biology 
<BR>
and engineering.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Through this new enterprise, the best and brightest from across 
<BR>
the sciences and across the country, can focus their talents on 
<BR>
meeting the challenges NASA faces in our future missions,&quot; said 
<BR>
Goldin.
<BR>
<P>It will build and further strengthen academic community 
<BR>
involvement in all of NASA's scientific and technology missions 
<BR>
and, in addition, will establish the organization needed to 
<BR>
facilitate effective use of International Space Station facilities 
<BR>
for targeted scientific and technology research in a microgravity 
<BR>
environment. The new enterprise will also establish the 
<BR>
organization needed to transfer scientific and technological 
<BR>
research results for Earth benefits.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There is a new urgency in understanding long-term human health in 
<BR>
space,&quot; said Goldin. &quot;Given these daunting challenges, NASA must 
<BR>
develop and exploit revolutionary technology to maintain crew 
<BR>
health and make space-based clinical care truly space based. 
<BR>
Enhancing our understanding of human health is critical.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Under the new plan, OLMSA will be renamed the Office of Biological 
<BR>
and Physical Research (BPR) and enhanced to form a separate 
<BR>
enterprise focusing on scientific research. Previously, OLMSA was 
<BR>
a part of the Human Exploration and Development of Space 
<BR>
Enterprise (HEDS). The new BPR office will work closely with HEDS 
<BR>
to facilitate long-term exploration of space.
<BR>
<P>NASA Chief Scientist Dr. Kathie L. Olsen will be acting Associate 
<BR>
Administrator for the new enterprise, and will return to her 
<BR>
position as Chief Scientist once a permanent Associate 
<BR>
Administrator is named. Dr. Julie Swain will serve as acting 
<BR>
Deputy Associate Administrator.
<BR>
<P>BPR will include a wide spectrum of scientific research, including 
<BR>
basic, applied, biological, physical, chemical, and biomedical. 
<BR>
BPR will increase the academic community's involvement in NASA's 
<BR>
science and technology missions.
<BR>
<P>BPR will be made up of five divisions:
<BR>
<P>*   The Physical Sciences division will be structured to promote 
<BR>
cross-disciplinary physical, chemical, biological and theoretical 
<BR>
research.
<BR>
<P>*   Fundamental Space Biology will be established at the division 
<BR>
level to apply the revolutionary changes in molecular biology and 
<BR>
genetics to a space-based environment.
<BR>
<P>*   Biomedical and Human Support Research will also be established 
<BR>
at the division level and will integrate fundamental and clinical 
<BR>
research to prioritize crew health, medical and environmental 
<BR>
technology issues. It will focus research on critical crew health, 
<BR>
safety and performance issues.
<BR>
<P>*   The Division of Research Integration will focus on cross-
<BR>
discipline research and resource integration within BPR and across 
<BR>
NASA. 
<BR>
<P>*   The Division of Policy and Program Integration will not be 
<BR>
changed under the reorganization.
<BR>
<P>Goldin noted that advances in biological sciences are opening new 
<BR>
opportunities for the space program. Just recently, NASA entered 
<BR>
into an agreement with the National Cancer Institute to work on 
<BR>
nanotechnologies with a dual purpose ­ to develop revolutionary 
<BR>
technologies for early detection of cancer in patients here on 
<BR>
Earth and early detection of illness in astronauts up in space.
<BR>
<P>&quot;By combining NCI's expertise in biochemistry, molecular and 
<BR>
cellular biology and clinical medicine with NASA's expertise in 
<BR>
physical micro-systems and biotechnology, we can develop the 
<BR>
fundamentals for an entirely new technology discipline,&quot; said 
<BR>
Goldin. 
<BR>
<P>The new enterprise will create an infrastructure that integrates 
<BR>
research and technology, broadens NASA's peer-reviewed research 
<BR>
programs to strengthen ties with universities, and provides 
<BR>
answers to questions fundamental for the future.
