<BR>
<P>&quot;When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.&quot;
<BR>
<P>That's the phrase that popped into my mind last night at a brainstorming 
<BR>
session with some fellow transhumanists. It seems like every solution to
<BR>
every problem we came up with revolved around delegating the decision making
<BR>
power to some sort of market. In a large part, the conversation wasn't even
<BR>
about economics. We were talking about things like traffic lights, bandwidth
<BR>
allocation on network routers, Idea Futures, and improved ways of assigning
<BR>
seats on airplanes.
<BR>
<P>This means one or more likely both of the following-- 
<BR>
<P>1. Markets really are close to the best possible method for allocating
<BR>
resources and arbitrating disputes.
<BR>
<P>2. All my buddies and I have markets on the brain and are overlooking the
<BR>
shortcomings of markets, as well as the strengths of possible alternatives.
<BR>
<P>Not that I can see any flaws in our reasnoning... but that's exactly what
<BR>
I would think if I had blinders on.
<BR>
<P>BEFORE YET ANOTHER FLAME WAR COMMENCES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT LIBERTARIANS SUCK,
<BR>
READ THE REST OF THIS MESSAGE:
<BR>
<P>Overall, I believe markets *are* better than centralized planning. I
<BR>
doubt that at our current level of technological and economic
<BR>
development we're going to come up with something that's better accross
<BR>
the board. However, I think everything can be debugged, and that's what
<BR>
I'm trying to do with the concept of free markets. I'm not good at
<BR>
noticing bugs in this case, because I'm so immersed in free market
<BR>
think. I'm hoping to get some input from others on...
<BR>
<P>a) Flaws in how other market systems were implemented.
<BR>
<P>b) Problems that are inherently intractable to market solutions.
<BR>
<P>c) Is it a binary axis of markets versus central planning, or are there 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conflict resolution and resource allocation systems that are completely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different from both approaches.
<BR>
<P>d) Are there any books or essays that anybody would recommend for a rational,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructive critique of market systems?
<BR>
<P>I'M TRYING TO START A RATIONAL, PRAGMATIC DISCUSSION. PLEASE TRY TO KEEP
<BR>
EMOTIONS AND MORAL AXIOMS OUT OF THIS. PLEASE TRY TO KEEP THIS AT AN
<BR>
ABSTRACT LEVEL AND AVOID INVOKING EMOTIONALLY LADEN ARGUMENTS.
<BR>
<P>In other words, I'm trying to address this at the level of 'How best to
<BR>
divide up finite resource XXX between agents A, B, and C under
<BR>
conditions YYY?' rather than 'Should ruthless sleazy factory owners be
<BR>
allowed to steal food from the mouths of unemployed single mothers with
<BR>
AIDS?'.
