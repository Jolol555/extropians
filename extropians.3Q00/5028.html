<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; suffice it to say that what you are advocating is clearly the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; murder the most defenseless members of society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>BL:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You're doing the same when you kill a fetus.  Why kid yourself and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pretend that you're not?
</EM><BR>
<P>SA:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why  barbaric categoric remarks guaranteed to do nothing but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antagonize?
</EM><BR>
<P>I  should probably clarify my remarks, Samantha, especially since you may
<BR>
not have seen my earlier posts on this topic.  My intent was not to
<BR>
antagonize, but it's probably accurate to say that the remark about
<BR>
infanticide was meant to be barbaric, if by barbaric you mean foreign or
<BR>
alien.  I was briefly stepping outside the bounds of my native culture
<BR>
and attempting to objectively consider a basic philosophical question.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Especially when you know, if you've made much attention at all, that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue is by no means so simple.
</EM><BR>
<P>If my posts gave the impression that I think the issue is simple, then
<BR>
I've clearly failed to communicate effectively, and for this I apologize.
<BR>
&nbsp;The reason I chose to participate in this discussion is that the issue
<BR>
has not been resolved.  The US Supreme court decision in Roe v. Wade was
<BR>
a political decision rather than a well-reasoned analysis of
<BR>
constitutional law.  The decision is therefore vulnerable with respect to
<BR>
such political events as the appointment of new justices.  See, for
<BR>
example, the following article on the web: NARAL Fears Reversal Of Roe v.
<BR>
Wade After 2000 Election
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a370225b900a4.htm">http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a370225b900a4.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Of the young women I've talked to about abortion within the past couple
<BR>
of years, the best educated and passionate about the subject are those
<BR>
who are in favor of making abortion illegal (in many cases they would
<BR>
deny abortions even to women whose health is endangered by the pregnancy
<BR>
or who were the victims of incestuous rape).  Those young women who are
<BR>
not &quot;pro-life&quot; are for the most part complacent; they tend to believe
<BR>
that the issue has been solved forever.  They have no concept of  the way
<BR>
life was for women in the US before Roe v. Wade--and the way it still is
<BR>
in the many jurisdictions where abortion is currently illegal.
<BR>
<P>For those too young to remember what it was like back then, see:  Walk in
<BR>
Her Shoes
<BR>
An Exploration of the Barriers to Access Before Abortion Became Legal
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.choice.org/roevwade/index.htm">http://www.choice.org/roevwade/index.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Naturally, poor women were at a far greater disadvantage than wealthy
<BR>
women who could afford to get abortions at medical clinics in other
<BR>
countries.  In many cases where a woman already has a child or children,
<BR>
the birth of another child means a severe decrease in the quality of life
<BR>
for the older children, and in some cases, means death.  (I wirte from
<BR>
first hand observation here) .  
<BR>
<P>This is one way in which the issue is not as simple as some people would
<BR>
make it out to be.  They look only at the first hours of life of the
<BR>
newly born baby, and don't consider its subsequent life or the effects
<BR>
its life has on its family.  From a purely economic viewpoint, it would
<BR>
seem preferable to sacrifice the life of a newly born infant than to
<BR>
sacrifice the lives of older siblings who represent (among other things)
<BR>
many hours of labor on the part of the parents or other members of the
<BR>
society.  This is likely why infanticide has been practiced within many
<BR>
cultural settings.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  And that is all I will say on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject except that it is a point of some despair for the future of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; race that we are still at arms over abortion after all of these 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years.
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems a pity that you, or anyone, would refuse to examine an
<BR>
unresolved issue simply because it's controversial.  Defining human life
<BR>
seems more critical than ever at this point in time--not only for
<BR>
purposes of deciding whether or when abortion should be legal, but also
<BR>
for deciding whether or under what circumstances human cloning should be
<BR>
legal, whether a machine-based human consciousness should be considered
<BR>
human, etc.
