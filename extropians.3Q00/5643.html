<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second one is not very well known -- mrs. anerton from edith 
<BR>
wharton's short story &quot;the muse's tragedy.&quot; what follows is a summary 
<BR>
of the story stolen from a random website. the full text can be

<P>&quot;Danyers is a great admirer of the late poet Vincent Rendle, about 
<BR>
whose work Danyers had written an excellent study. One of the most 
<BR>
distinguished of Rendle's works is the Sonnets to Silvia. As a 
<BR>
widespread rumor holds, Silvia is actually Mrs. Anerton, with whom 
<BR>
Rendle presumably had a secret love affair. Danyers has a strong desire
<BR>
to meet this woman who had been such an inspiration for the famous
<BR>
poet. Once, during a vacation in Italy, Danyers happens by chance to 
<BR>
run into Mrs. Anerton, who is now widowed, living a lonely life. 
<BR>
Through their long conversations about Rendle's poetry, Danyers and 
<BR>
Mrs. Anerton quickly become close friends. At the end of the holidays, 
<BR>
they decide to meet again in a month, ostensibly so that Danyers can 
<BR>
start writing a book on Rendle with the help of Mrs. Anerton. This 
<BR>
project, however, is more an excuse for them to see each other again. 
<BR>
The last part of the story consists of a long letter that Mrs. Anerton 
<BR>
has written to Danyers, and from which we discover that when they 
<BR>
actually met in Venice, they spent a wonderful time-not once mentioning
<BR>
the dead poet. At the end of their stay, Danyers had asked Mrs. Anerton
<BR>
to marry him, and in this letter she explains why she cannot accept his
<BR>
offer. Mrs. Anerton confesses that contrary to widespread belief, there
<BR>
was never anything but friendship between her and Rendle; she had never
<BR>
been Rendle' s lover, although she had been very much in love with him.
<BR>
Since she never was Silvia, the object of Rendle's love, she cannot
<BR>
accept Danyers' proposal; although she is very much taken by him, 
<BR>
Danyers cannot take the place of the unattainable love object that 
<BR>
Rendle was.&quot;
