<EM> &gt; technologies that can be plugged into that grid.  I know what the line is 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; like on the business front, but what's the line really like on the technology 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; front?
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't been following the field for the last few years, but I'd
<BR>
imagine that the biggest problem still remains achieving the economy
<BR>
of scale. Total cost of ownership is clearly better for thin-film
<BR>
photovoltaics vs. mono- and polycrystalline. There is not much demand
<BR>
for thin-film photovoltaics, and hence the prices for the large panels
<BR>
(which could be integrated into roofs and facades) remain
<BR>
high. Floatglass is not infinitely cheap, and it is not obvious that
<BR>
thin-film PV can become as cheap as floatglass, even given big
<BR>
volume. And polymers are notoriously prone to photolysis. Notice that
<BR>
productive life times of installations are high, at high purchase
<BR>
costs, which does not appeal to cash-drained/debt-ridden short-horizon
<BR>
planning.  Furthermore, the high-power semiconductors, necessary to
<BR>
transform the PV power into wall current or feed it back into the grid
<BR>
are also rare and hence expensive. In the U.S., lacking public
<BR>
interest and green legislation, power providers are relunctant to
<BR>
purchase power from residential roof installations, which results in
<BR>
either overcapacities (of course one could run air-conditioning at
<BR>
full speed during peak insolation times, or recharge EVs, provided one
<BR>
has them), or necessity of energy storage, which is not
<BR>
cheap. Batteries are not cheap, nor last long enough, electrolysis is
<BR>
not widespread nor particularly efficient, and would require in-house
<BR>
hydrogen storage and another new technology, fuel cells.
<BR>
<P>I'd rather use existing methane (natural gas) infrastructure to push
<BR>
small fuel cells and methane reformers into houses, creating
<BR>
integrated coupled electricity/heat production in residential units
<BR>
and small groups of units (despite absence of collaboration in the
<BR>
typical U.S. residential area, and general tendency to ignore
<BR>
environmental aspects due to lack of ecological attitude and
<BR>
artificially maintained low energy prices). Once this basic
<BR>
infrastructure is there, one can utilize synergism, and push PV/water
<BR>
electrolyzers/hydrogen storage.
<BR>
<P>Because we're talking about a whole network of new technologies, due
<BR>
to multiple synergies best introduced simultaneously, none of them yet
<BR>
arrived, this is a multiple chicken-and-egg problem. This requires
<BR>
attitude (more than just being informed about possibilities), plus
<BR>
loose money, plus time. All of this taken together, this does not seem
<BR>
a short-term winner.
<BR>
<P>Just now alternative/renewable energy seem mostly a toy for the
<BR>
financially secure and highly educated elite. Mainstream will follow
<BR>
in time, once (provided) a critical mass has been achieved, resulting
<BR>
in lower prices and synergies becoming exploitable.
<BR>
<P>The big unknown is the time scale of the advent of molecular
<BR>
manufacturing of either brand, or microwaved power from a solar
<BR>
satellite fleet made in situ from extraterrestrial material. Either
<BR>
engineered plants or growing photosynthetic panels/houses, or
<BR>
&quot;wireless power too cheap to meter&quot;* will of course greatly push
<BR>
public** acceptance.
<BR>
<P>'gene
<BR>
<P>* Tesla wasn't all that wrong.
<BR>
<P>** given that there is still a public capable of accepting anything, of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course.
