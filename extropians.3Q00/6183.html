<EM>&gt; As for that odd scenario you posted earlier, curiosity - however necessary

<EM>&gt; unnecessary to a functioning mind - is a perfectly reasonable subgoal of

<EM>&gt; Friendliness, and therefore doesn't *need* to have independent motive

force.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure I understand how curiosity can be a subgoal for a seed ai; I'd
<BR>
love some more on that.

<P>I read catai, and most of catai 2.0 (do you still call it that)? But I can't
<BR>
remember some crucial things you said about goals/subgoals. Specifically, do
<BR>
you expect them to be strictly hierarchical, or is it a more general
<BR>
network, where if x is a (partial) subgoal of y, y can also be a (partial)
<BR>
subgoal of x? Certainly, it strikes me that there ought to be multiple &quot;top
<BR>
level&quot; goals, and they ought to come into conflict; I don't think that one
<BR>
top level goal do the job. I suspect that might apply at any level of the
<BR>
goal &quot;hierarchy&quot; (or network) on which you wish to focus. Is this your
<BR>
thinking?
