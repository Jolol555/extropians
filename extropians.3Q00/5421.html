<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;if this eventual Sentience ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;manages to transcend space-time then conceivably (depending on how you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;take things like Many Worlds notions) this being can in fact be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;omni-present, Alpha and Omega, and so on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That idea was advanced quite seriously (I think) by Sir Fred Hoyle in THE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; INTELLIGENT UNIVERSE, who appears to believe that life and we are/were/will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be bootstrapped by a cosmic Mind coalescing in the deep future and acting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; backward through time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is a pretty twisty notion as are most time-travel type paradoxes.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would lead to the notion (among others) that any universe whose initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conditions allow for the development of such Sentience and where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time-travel is possible and closed within the universe is largely the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creation of said Sentience.  But that would conflate abilities to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transcend time and participate largely throughout its [the universe]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development with actual participation.  And I don't see that such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participation necessarily could extend all the way to the actual birth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that universe or to periods and more local conditions where no known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws of physics would support intelligence or information or action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Sentience would have to be able to step outside the Universe to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exercise that level of control if it is possible at all.  Admittedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; armchair blather but fun nonetheless.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I see it, Hoyle is apparently utilizing the theories of Closed Timelike
<BR>
Curves. Essentially, the whole universe is a closed timelike curve (if the
<BR>
universe is a closed universe, which does not seem likely.) such that at some
<BR>
future point, a future entity in the previous iteration would have gone back in
<BR>
time from the future to the beginning and cranked everything up due to its mere
<BR>
appearance in the past. The fact that the universe seems open at this point is
<BR>
irrelevant, because so long as there is a singularity that has existed since the
<BR>
beginning, then we are in a closed timelike curve, and it will become closed due
<BR>
to future events. 
<BR>
<P>A good smaller scale treatment of this is Barnes' _Kaleidoscope Century_, where
<BR>
the KGB creates a singularity at the Earth/Sun L3 point (opposite the sun from
<BR>
us) in 1980 or so, and a KGB agent has gone through thousands of CTC iterations,
<BR>
tweaking the 21st century, and dragging along her sidekick, who is the main
<BR>
character, a rather memory befuddled individual.
