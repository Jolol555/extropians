&nbsp;------------------ 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;1. The education of the public about scientific advances such
</EM><BR>
that they can make more informed decisions about technology and
<BR>
its regulation through legislative initiatives.
<BR>
<P>And, one logical means to this end,
<BR>
<P>2. Directed efforts to bridge the communication gap between scientific
<BR>
communities and the public.&lt;
<BR>
<P>On the first point, I tried this once and failed.  On the second
<BR>
point, this is precisely what I have attempted to do outside
<BR>
the political architecture and have succeeding on many fronts
<BR>
through implementing cultural projects outside our Extropian
<BR>
community.  Reaching more than one hundred thousand people through
<BR>
TV programming and speaking at conferences and academic structures
<BR>
has been beneficial.  But more than this, communicating Extropian
<BR>
ideas through the arts has been the one largest accomplishment
<BR>
because the arts largely influences culture.  Although I am not
<BR>
presently involved in the film industry, I continue to communicate
<BR>
ideas to producers and directors who are deeply emerged in that
<BR>
industry.  But I am not alone.  Many extropians pursue communicating
<BR>
sound information about future technologies.  One aspect of the
<BR>
work we do that alerts minds and pricks up ears is our presence
<BR>
in the press.  Recently, FM-2030's cryonic suspension reached
<BR>
newspapers and radio programs around the world.  It is terribly
<BR>
ironic that his loss of functioning caused such a media alert.
<BR>
The only upside of this tragic event was that his life and interests
<BR>
in future technologies was reported in some of the most prestigious
<BR>
news periodicals around. Recently, I was at a scientific think-thank
<BR>
meeting recently and it was quite interesting to see who welcomed
<BR>
me as a cross-liner (arts/sciences):  While Robert Freitas and
<BR>
Mike West (the heavy hitters) were receptive Greg Stock (?) was
<BR>
not.  Scientisits themselves have got to understand that being
<BR>
territorial about it only pushes the public away. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Wouldn't you like to know how the pro's and con's were presented
</EM><BR>
to your president?&lt;
<BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Wouldn't it be sort of useful for us to know how this and
</EM><BR>
related issues (to tie this back to extropian initiatives) are
<BR>
presented to those that govern us?&lt;  
<BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If we knew how they conceptualize new technologies,
</EM><BR>
we would be in a much more informed position from which to influence
<BR>
both legislation and public opinion?&lt;
<BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P>And here is the dichotomy.  We favor not being tied to any one
<BR>
political viewpoint (I am now not aligned to a political party)
<BR>
but we do need a Global agenda.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My first question: is this classified information?
</EM><BR>
My second question: if not, how do we acquire this information,
<BR>
or do any among you possess it?
<BR>
My third question: if it is classified, should it be?&lt;
<BR>
<P>Don't know.  I have to follow the lines of being neither right
<BR>
not left, but up.  It seems entirely more sophisticated to vote
<BR>
on issues rather than people and party-lines.
