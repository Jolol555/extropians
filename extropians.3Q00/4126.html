<EM>&gt; There must be opportunities in the world for making profits while doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil. The corporation as a form of relatively efficient organization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allows more of these opportunities to be accessed. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that makes sense; organizing in a group amplifies your power, for
<BR>
good or evil.  However corporations and other groups are not inherently
<BR>
evil or wrong, any more than are other power amplification systems like
<BR>
science and technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A lot of evil contributed to big corporations seem to consist of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations where two parties voluntarily cooporate on some effort, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because one of the parties is in a significantly weaker bargaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position (because of market conditions, lack of information, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever), most of the benefit deriving from the effort goes to the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; party (i.e. shareholders of the corporation). Is it evil to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
</EM><BR>
<P>IMO it is not evil to engage in interactions which are voluntary for
<BR>
all parties.  As I understand these situations, the &quot;victim&quot; actually
<BR>
has his situation improved, but just not as much as the victimizer.
<BR>
However I know that many people have a different intuition.
<BR>
<P>There was an article in the 3/28/98 issue of Science News about
<BR>
experiments in a game where there is a sum of money which will be
<BR>
divided between two people.  The first person makes an offer to the
<BR>
second person of how the money should be split, and the second person
<BR>
agrees or not.  If he agrees they both get the money and it is split
<BR>
according to the offer.  If he disagrees, neither gets the money.
<BR>
<P>The first person has all the leverage in this game; he can keep almost
<BR>
all the money and offer a pittance to the second player, and it is to
<BR>
the second player's advantage to accept.  However in practice, if he
<BR>
offers too little, the second player will refuse.  Most people offer
<BR>
a substantial fraction to the second player, 30% or more, which is
<BR>
usually accepted.
<BR>
<P>It seems that most people have instinctive beliefs about fair behavior
<BR>
in situations of unequal power.  Applied to the case of corporations,
<BR>
they consider it wrong for corporations to use their market power to
<BR>
help themselves, even when they do so only by offering lesser advantages
<BR>
to others.  Microsoft is a good current example.
