<EM>&gt; &gt; The reason I question his inclusion was because I doubt he is a &quot;total

man&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and I also question whether he is an &quot;enlightened master.&quot;  What, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particular, makes you think he is?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, he's dead now. So he isn't enlightened anymore.
</EM><BR>
<P>Use of the present tense is not wrong in this context, but I won't argue
<BR>
it.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I equate the term &quot;total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man&quot; with &quot;enlightened master&quot; because the two terms seem to me to
</EM><BR>
describe
<BR>
<EM>&gt; identical beings.
</EM><BR>
<P>This does not answer either question.  Why is Mohammed either?  What
<BR>
characteristics do you see in him that lead you to believe he is/was a
<BR>
&quot;total man,&quot; an &quot;enlightened master,&quot; or &quot;fully awakened beyond words&quot;?
<BR>
(Whatever the last phrase means!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I put Mohammed in the same category with Buddha, Moses, Lao
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tzu, Christ, Krishna, Socrates, and Kabir because all these were fully
</EM><BR>
awakened
<BR>
<EM>&gt; beyond words. So, why did you single out Mohammed from the others?
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree that any on the list are &quot;fully awakened beyond words,&quot; but I
<BR>
chose to attack what I believe is the weakest link.  While I do agree
<BR>
Mohammed founded a religion, I do not see that as all that enlightening or
<BR>
as evidence of being a total man -- in the conventional sense of the word.
<BR>
This is, at least, from my readings of the Koran and history.  (I'm sure
<BR>
some will disagree here, but military conquest and the like do not seem like
<BR>
traits of enlightenment to me.  Of course, in Nietzsche's sense, I can see
<BR>
how he would see this as part of being a &quot;total man,&quot; given his views of
<BR>
natural virtues.  However, it is just in this point that I think we must
<BR>
question Nietzsche.)
<BR>
<P>Now, if you mean by those terms, founders of new religions or of new
<BR>
philosphical movements, then, yeah, they all seem to fit, though that's not
<BR>
saying much.  Why not put the pre-Socratics in there too, and the guy who
<BR>
founded Mormonism as well as Madame Blavatsky?  (Of course, perhaps you do,
<BR>
since you had &quot;et al.&quot; on your original list.)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
