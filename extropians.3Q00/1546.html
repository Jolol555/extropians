<EM>&gt; A socioeconomic approach to LE??? Hmmm.

<P>Of course its a socioeconomic paradigm problem.  If we &quot;thought&quot;
<BR>
we could &quot;solve&quot; aging to the same degree we &quot;thought&quot; we could
<BR>
build a quasi-effective missle defense system, don't you think
<BR>
we would have spent $100B on that instead? (Spike or John, correct
<BR>
me if that figure is wrong).  That is roughly 30x the amount
<BR>
spent on the human genome project and equal to ~6+ years of
<BR>
the current NIH budget.
<BR>
<P>One would like to believe that with a year or two of intensive
<BR>
retraining, most of the bright engineers &amp; software people at
<BR>
Lockheed, Boeing, etc. who work on defense projects could
<BR>
refocus on micro &amp; nanoengineering to extend life.  Now isn't
<BR>
that an interesting concept?
<BR>
<P>And believe me it will take that level of effort -- the design
<BR>
of biobots with several thousand &quot;parts&quot; or nanobots with
<BR>
potentially billions of atoms will require large teams of
<BR>
people who understand large scale engineering efforts --
<BR>
those are generally *not* the people who work in life sciences
<BR>
related fields.
<BR>
<P>The important thing to relize about Life Extension efforts is
<BR>
&quot;THE PROGRAM *IS* BROKEN&quot;.  It was not and cannot (by nature)
<BR>
be designed to allow you to live indefinately.  To fix it
<BR>
completely you are going to have to reengineer it.  The only
<BR>
way to do that is with large scale engineering efforts.
