<EM>&gt; I am an artist.  Or rather, I have made and hope to continue to make a

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mr. Damien Broderick appears to be in a similar position.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which points me in the direction of a query:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are the primary advocates of intellectual property mostly artists and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content creators?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've done engineering, writing, graphic design, and art (painting when
<BR>
younger, now strictly computer work, though some freehand sketching
<BR>
still). I do see that while artists want to get paid, it is typically
<BR>
corporations, IMHO that are most vehement and vocal about IP rights, as
<BR>
they are acting in their roles of minimizing the risk and maximizing the
<BR>
value of the stock of their shareholders, but have little to do with
<BR>
originating art. I very much dislike how the recording industry
<BR>
virtually enslaves musicians such that even the most successful debut
<BR>
album for a musician or a band results in less than $100,000 for the
<BR>
artist after promotional and other costs are calculated (if not just
<BR>
break even or a loss). The industry has its own group of insiders who,
<BR>
IMHO, leach the profit out of the art, leaving the artist dependent upon
<BR>
producing successive albums and endlessly touring to make anything like
<BR>
the amount of money the record company makes. Only the oldest and
<BR>
longest lasting artists end up with significant wealth (Beatles, Eagles,
<BR>
Fleetwood Mac, etc.) after a life of battling to regain and retain
<BR>
control of their work.
