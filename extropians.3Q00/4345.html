The fact that I'm consistently met with hostility by people unwilling to admit their is a problem let alone a specific free-market solution only furthers my desire to make a clean break from this particular transhumanist movement.

<P>Paul, please don't leave this list!!!  We need you here; even if not everyone recognizes that.  You provide an opposing view that is needed and over time perhaps you can help us collectively see things in a more realistic light.  If you go then the very people you have a problem with will have won.

<P>I think Mike Lorrey is a good guy.  He is just very opinionated and quick to sharply speak his mind.  Don't be thin-skinned about his comments or those made by others.  Please, just stand your ground and let it be &quot;water off a duck's back&quot; like the old saying goes.  
<BR>
<P>Paul, I can understand your frustration in a general way with list members but I think Max is a very bright, perceptive fellow who is not close-minded and has created an organization which does offer so much.  And remember, many of the list members have profitted quite a bit from the &quot;new economy&quot; and so are avid &quot;no-restraint&quot; free-marketers.
<BR>
<P>best wishes,
<BR>
