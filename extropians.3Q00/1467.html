<P><EM>&gt; Who is this &quot;you&quot; you're talking about?  Does it have a referent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinct from &quot;IQ points&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not falling for this trap, since I can never fully describe who I am, neither
<BR>
can you.  The second question opens up an entire cannery of worms.  Am I the parts,
<BR>
or am I the whole, or both?  Are there many I's or only one? Etc., etc., ad nauseum.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; After all what exactly are we referring to as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intelligence - raw logical reasoning abilities and nothing more?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.  We're talking about wisdom and self-awareness.  (Not that quote raw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logical reasoning abilities unquote wouldn't be reason enough to stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off Prozac.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah yes, is it wise to remain so depressed that all one can think about is how
<BR>
horrible things are, how one wants to kill oneself at any time, and how it's
<BR>
pointless to do anything, since everything will end in abject failure and misery?
<BR>
Self-awareness that is as ultimately arbitrary as the neurochemical soup that
<BR>
composes it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know a few people who are extremely intelligent and have spent the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; majority of their adult lives laying on their beds depressed with absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no ambition to do anything.  What have they accomplished?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I should think I have accomplished a great deal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, but many depressed people accomplish very little.  We could sight Van Gogh,
<BR>
but alas he cut of his ear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe he had a curable problem that was solved with no drawbacks.  Or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe he sacrificed everything that made him unique so he could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happy.  I can't tell from the information provided.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my friends case this so called uniqueness of his has kept him from holding a
<BR>
steady job, thereby stranding him below the poverty line.  He only accessed the
<BR>
internet earlier this year.  His view of the world was so darkly colored, that he
<BR>
saw little hope of doing anything.  He saw all of my transhumanist aspirations in
<BR>
extremely jaded ways.  If there was a negative way to view the world, he was the
<BR>
first one to proclaim it.
<BR>
<P>In the worse case scenario,  taking St. John's Wort may have limited his
<BR>
intelligence in finding increasingly clever ways to maintain his dark view of the
<BR>
world.  If there was a way for him to see the downside of something no matter how
<BR>
positively presented he could do it.  Now for the first time, he is actually trying
<BR>
to do something with his life.
<BR>
<P>So I will re-iterate, that it's all a matter of balance.  That being happy has its
<BR>
own merits, and is in a very significant way a measure of intelligence as much as
<BR>
the ability to ace IQ tests or philosophize about existence.  If as you say our
<BR>
current primitive state of neuropsychopharmacology can either increase our happiness
<BR>
or our intellects, then each person will have to strike a balance between their
<BR>
emotional needs and intellectual ones.
