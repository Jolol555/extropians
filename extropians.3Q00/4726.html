<EM>&gt; Not neccessarily. Photosynthesis is only 1-3% efficent, and the

theoretical
<BR>
<EM>&gt; limit of the ATP cycle is about 5%, as I recall. Where agriculture based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation gets its advantage is that its cheap to grow acres of the
</EM><BR>
stuff,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; since it does it itself, where silicon cells are expensive to make, even
</EM><BR>
at
<BR>
<EM>&gt; current industrial rates.
</EM><BR>
<P>One could also make the plant more efficient in other ways, such as
<BR>
respiration and the like, making it need less overall energy to live and
<BR>
more for output.  However, I think this is not a practical, short term
<BR>
solution for energy production, especially to suit current demand.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The difficulty with grass that generates electricity is conductors. You'd
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to run electrical conductors along the ground, and have the grass plants
</EM><BR>
weave
<BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves into series/parallel networks to conduct energy, with two types
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; roots that grow toward different metals, like copper and aluminum, so you
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; draw current from the field to the grid.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose one could make plants than produce chemicals that react to produce
<BR>
electricity.  In essense, most electric production does rely on organic
<BR>
matter as a primary input -- oil, gas, coal.
<BR>
<P>But don't you think a more efficient method of get cheap energy would be to
<BR>
increase oil drilling, especially outside OPEC controlled areas?  Also,
<BR>
fomenting rebellion within OPEC might be another solution.  I'm not calling
<BR>
for military action...
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
