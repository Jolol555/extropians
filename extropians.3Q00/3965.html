<P>&quot;Is Intellectual Property Legitimate?&quot;

<P>While you are there, study everything at mises.org, beginning
<BR>
with &quot;Human Action&quot; by L.von Mises
<BR>
<P>also check out antiwar.com for reasons for and methods of 
<BR>
rolling back state/corporate) power.

<EM>&gt;Is capitalism the problem, or is what we have so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perturbed by regulation that it can't truly be called capitalism?
</EM><BR>
<P>Capitalism, or free markets, is the solution. The problems stem from
<BR>
Marxism's 'followers', such as The Council on Foreign Relations, which
<BR>
'gave' us the Federal Reserve System, graduated income tax (sponsored
<BR>
by the predecessors of the CFR), public education, Social Security, gold
<BR>
confiscation, the Cold War, the other debt/welfare programs, and other 
<BR>
state crimes too numerous to list here.
<BR>
Note that all Presidential candidates, the interlocking directorates of 
<BR>
the Fortune 500, the Federal Reserve Board members, etc. are all ipso facto
<BR>
'required' to be members of the CFR.
<BR>
The story of Standard Oil (now called Exxon-Mobil-Texaco-Phillips 
<BR>
66-Chevron-Arco-etc.) provides a prototype of the anti-competitive, 
<BR>
anti-free market stance of our part-time owners.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Either way, their is definitely a growing unrest as to what many people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see as Corporate Power gone out of control.  The recent scuffle in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seattle is only the beginning of more civil unrest over the issue of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Corporate Profits vs. Individual Liberties.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I have always tried to maintain freemarket principles, but when I see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporations gaining this much power over individual lives, I begin to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt those beliefs and my appreciation of capitalism as usual.  Now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here is a scary question - is capitalism now at odds with the spirit of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a free market, and more importantly individual liberty?  For those with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strong reactions to this question, I am urging you to respond as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligently and rationally as you can.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Paul Hughes
</EM><BR>
<P>It is socialism in all its guises that is at odds with free markets, 
<BR>
rationality and freedom. Its most spectacular failures in the FSU, 
<BR>
such as the malinvestments of the Cold War and the collapse of FSU 
<BR>
Social Security programs are instructive, as we will soon be 
<BR>
experiencing this in the US.
<BR>
<P>The word &quot;Capitalism&quot; has undergone a morph of meanings much as has the word
<BR>
&quot;Liberalism&quot;. &quot;Free markets&quot; may have to be used these days, although this
<BR>
is also being co-opted by NWO/WTO/UN socialists.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Inside every socialist is a little dictator.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Incidentally, the greatest 'crack-up boom' (sponsored by the Federal 
<BR>
Reserve System) in human history is now well into the bust phase, 
<BR>
very similar to the 1920's-1930's, albeit with many new twists.
<BR>
We may see some interesting financial spectaculars this month, certainly 
<BR>
coming to a winter near you.
