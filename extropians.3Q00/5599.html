<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Believers in the omnipotence of AIs seem to think that for any given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;person, in any given situation, there is some input they can be given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which will cause them to produce any desired output.  If I see a nun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in the middle of prayer in the chapel, there is something I can say to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;her that will make her immediately start screeching like a chimp while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;jumping around the room scratching herself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You know, given a trillion high fidelity simulations of that nun to test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible responses, I bet I could construct a sentence that would do just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that. My first order approximation is that it would involve me claiming to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be sent from God, combined with a thourough demonstration of omniscience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with respect to her life up to that point, all of which is easily acheivable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given those simulations, and an arbitrary amount subjective time to think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was going to say exactly that.  Congratulations, Sunley, you have restored
<BR>
my faith in the Extropians list.
<BR>
<P>I would have added that, in addition to backing up the initial action
<BR>
specification with a high motivational priority - which can come from
<BR>
pretending to be God, or offering a million dollars, or any number of other
<BR>
methods - you need some way to disrupt the binding of the emotional tone of
<BR>
embarassment to the modeled projection of the reactions of other folks around
<BR>
the room.  There are any number of ways to do this; you can shift the focus of
<BR>
attention; invoke an interfering emotional tone; convince the nun that the
<BR>
other people in the room are *expecting* her to do that, or that the other
<BR>
people don't count for any number of reasons.  Or just give a sufficiently
<BR>
high-priority I-am-God order that it overrides the projected embarassment by
<BR>
brute force.
