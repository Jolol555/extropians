This was a posting to sci.crypt earlier this week:
<BR>
<P>: Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science is holding a 1-day
<BR>
: symposium on Oct 19 to mark the opening of Newell Simon Hall, its
<BR>
: newest building (<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~earthware">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~earthware</A>).  The theme is: 
<BR>
: A Good World in 2050: Will Computers Help or Hinder?
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Bill Joy (chief scientist of Sun Microsystems) will appear via CMU's
<BR>
: &quot;synthetic interview&quot; technology (the other speakers will appear in
<BR>
: person).  Joy will be interviewed for several hours beforehand with
<BR>
: prepared questions.  The recordings are then re-structered to allow
<BR>
: questions during the symposium, which are then automatically matched
<BR>
: to relevant answers.  This synthetic interview will later be placed on
<BR>
: the web for all to access.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: According to deja.com, this newsgroup had some discussions of a Joy
<BR>
: article in Wired (cited on the above URL).  This mail asks you to take
<BR>
: part by contributing serious questions that may be pertinent to the
<BR>
: symposium topic, or may be broader.  Please email to me directly.

<BR>
<P>That's an interesting methodology.  Apparently people ask questions
<BR>
during the symposium, and Joy's interview is stored on disk, indexed
<BR>
somehow so that a relevant answer can be found almost instantly to any
<BR>
(likely) question.  As long as no one asks, &quot;what is the capital of
<BR>
North Dakota,&quot; they should be okay.
<BR>
<P>So you can send in your questions, but then even if Joy answers them,
<BR>
apparently you are dependent on someone asking a similar question during
<BR>
the symposium in order for the response to make it into the &quot;synthetic
<BR>
interview&quot;.  Odd.
