<EM>&gt; There is.  One group creates one mind; one mind creates the Singularity.  That

<EM>&gt; much is determined by the dynamics of technology and intelligence; it is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy decision, and there is no way that I or anyone else can alter it.  At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some point, you just have to trust someone, and try to minimize coercion or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulations or the use of nuclear weapons, on the grounds that having the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience and wisdom to create an AI is a better qualification than being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to use force.  If the situation were iterated, if it were any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social interaction, then there would be a rationale for voting and laws -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democracy is the only known means by which humans can live together.  But if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's a single decision, made only once, in an engineering problem, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best available solution is to trust the engineer who makes it - the more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; politics you involve in the problem, the more force and coercion, the smaller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the chance of a good outcome.

<P>I don't believe in nuking people I disagree with or making such threats
<BR>
either.  But I will point out that there are/will be many teams
<BR>
attempting to create an AI capable of becoming SI. What makes you think
<BR>
one of the teams with white hats versus one with black hats (or simply
<BR>
gray) will get there first?  Also I don't believe that all the
<BR>
replication arguments put forth ably by Eugene are easily dismissed.  In
<BR>
short I don't believe a single AI will be all of any significance that
<BR>
we get.
