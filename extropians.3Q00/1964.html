Exactly. I get the strong impression that S. King treats his work much
<BR>
like anyone who like their job does. He wants to produce a product that
<BR>
will be purchased by as many people as possible and at the same time
<BR>
will provide him some pleasure in the actual creation.
<BR>
<P>That having been said, I think Muse's criticism is overly harsh. The
<BR>
Dark_Tower series, as well as Rose_Matter, are some of the best books
<BR>
within this genre. S. King's ability to capture a complete, and
<BR>
understandable, secondary character in one or two sentences stands above
<BR>
almost all of the authors I can readily think of. Not to mention the
<BR>
fact that the man is well and truly prolific with the written word.

<EM>&gt; &gt; yeah except Steven King has been writing utter shit for years.

<EM>&gt; I've always had a lot more respect for artists who actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to understand what their audience wants and provide that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than for those who think that art has some nebulous &quot;higher&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose beyond simple entertainment.  Shakespeare's greatest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strength was that he wrote simple entertainment for simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks; he wasn't afraid to go for the cheap laugh of a dirty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joke or a pun where needed, and his brilliant use of language
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and poetic form wasn't to challenge his audience's mind, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply to entertain them.  He juggled the language like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; street performer juggles torches, as deftly and for the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose.  /That/ is the highest form of art.
