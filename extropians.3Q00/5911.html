&quot;Spudboy&quot; writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Historical studies suggest strongly that many industrialist funded the nazis
</EM><BR>
in the 1920's to off-set gains by the commies and the social democrats. I shan't
<BR>
shed a tear for the poor capitalists, who contributed to the Hitler Fund. Graft
<BR>
was already a feature of Bismarckian Germany for 50 years since its inception in
<BR>
1866. These guys knew who they were funding. Also the nazis were heavilly into
<BR>
business in the reich-such as running everything from machine works to brothels.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact remains that capitalists are primarily into making money, not
<BR>
concentration camps. Anti-capitalists such as Stalin, et al., are the ones who
<BR>
murder tens of millions. Their motives are hatred and jealousy. They hate people
<BR>
who succeed, and they are jealous of people who make lots of money.
<BR>

<P><P><P>There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been
<BR>
originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet
<BR>
has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a
<BR>
beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are
<BR>
being, evolved.
