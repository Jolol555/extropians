<EM>&gt; &gt; Does calling someone a luddite (whether it is true or not) increase or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; decrease the probability of converting them to a &quot;better&quot; mode of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought? I'd be interested in hearing everyone's take on this, not just

<EM>&gt; &gt; Mike's.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Since when is converting your opponent to your point of view the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only (or even primary) purpose of an argument?  On a public mailing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I didn't mean to imply that this was the only (or even primary) reason
<BR>
one should have a conversation/argument. Sorry for the confusion, Lee
<BR>
(if I may use the familiar). Please take the question as asked, though.
<BR>
If a goal is to convert others who, in many different ways, hold strong
<BR>
anti-sentiments to your beliefs, what kind of style of communication do
<BR>
you think would be most likely to convert them? One that treats them
<BR>
politely, or one that does not?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; list like this I can think of many other goals: converting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; audience, clarifying the issues, learning about the opponent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measuring response to ideas, making social connections, and probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a few I haven't thought of.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Oh, absolutely! Others would be, an opportunity to stretch your word
<BR>
usage skills ('domestic canine', comes to mind =), clarify your own
<BR>
thinking on the issues, generate a historical record for future use,
<BR>
etc. But, let me ask you this: Do you think I would be more successful
<BR>
at converting the audience, having a chance to clarify issues, give my
<BR>
'opponent' the chance to give me information, measure their response to
<BR>
my ideas, and/or make a social connection if I used inflammatory
<BR>
language and style of delivery or if I took an approach more in keeping
<BR>
with Bonnie's suggestions?
<BR>
<P>A silly example (apologies to Bonnie):
<BR>
<P>1. Hey, luddite, what was the source of the info that led you to be
<BR>
against GM?
<BR>
2. What elements of GM do you find disturbing, because of your
<BR>
ignorance?
<BR>
3. Is there anything that would lead you and your Army of Lud to find GM
<BR>
less threatening?
<BR>
4. What is the level of your understanding of GM - anything beyond first
<BR>
grade science class?
<BR>
5. Are you, similar to other luddites, against sophisticated technology
<BR>
in general?
