You have to wonder in looking at this:

  Psychic Fraud?
  Florida Investigators Looking at Telephone Psychics 

  The attorney general’s economic crimes unit is
  investigating the Psychic Readers Network and its sister
  company, Access Resources Inc., after former employees
  testified that many of the telephone psychics were actually
  homeless people from the local Salvation Army shelter.

While I think most of you know that I am an extreme
supporter of the rights of the individual (and their
opinions), you just have to wonder if one should
support legal activities against people that take
advantage of the "irrational".  I mean, really, doing
that implies there will be an increase in the population
and political rights of those people who *really* have
no clue!

If we make the selection effect of our environment so soft that
"anyone" can survive, will we not doom ourselves?
