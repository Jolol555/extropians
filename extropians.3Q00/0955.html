<P>
<EM>&gt; things you mention are not truly good business ventures for me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Performance: costly with little return. Not available for painters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who wants to pay towatch me paint?
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said in the note, I limited the scope of discussion to musci
<BR>
because that's what started the thread.  Painters can't perform,
<BR>
that's true--but lack of copyright affects them far less than it
<BR>
would musicians anyway because original canvases are hard to
<BR>
duplicate (especially if they are tied to locations like murals
<BR>
on the walls of a building).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Work for hire: never a good way to get rich, under any circumstances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Someone else makes money off you. I prefer to hire rather than be hired.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nice of you to ignore my examples of work-for-hire millionaires and
<BR>
dismiss the way /I/ happen to make money with intellectual property.
<BR>
I earn my living, and have for some time, writing works for hire.  I
<BR>
have done magazine articles and web sites, and I currently write
<BR>
software that's used internally by the company I work for (it controls
<BR>
unique hardware that we sell the service of using).  Even when I was
<BR>
working for shrink-wrap software companies like MS, I was in QA,
<BR>
writing internal-use software to test and debug the selling software.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sampling and collaginging _ fail to see how that makes money, unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you sell your work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this obviously has to be combined with other methods like live
<BR>
performance or sales (note that sales of recordings still make money
<BR>
without copyrights, just less).  The point here is that elimination
<BR>
of copyright reduces the investment in creating these works.  This
<BR>
isn't such a big deal for music, but it's a /big/ deal for books.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; beggin; or street art: demeaning,  and for females, possible dangerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mugs and shit: also same, costs a bundle, (or if hand made redisculously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time consuming)
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Demeaning&quot; is just snobbery, and like I said, that's expensive.  It's
<BR>
only dangerous if you do it on the street, which is one method among
<BR>
many, and not even among the examples I gave (PBS, SPP).  If you
<BR>
don't want to do merchandise, fine, hire someone to do it for you,
<BR>
or don't make that money.  I'm arguing that the money is there for
<BR>
the taking.  If you don't feel like taking it, I can't argue with that.
<BR>
