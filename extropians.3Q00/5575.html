<EM>&gt; &gt; Oh, why bother.  I really am starting to get a bit frustrated over here.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been talking about this for weeks and it doesn't seem to have any effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whatsoever.  Nobody is even bothering to distinguish between subgoals and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; supergoals.  You're all just playing with words.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey!  Wait a second.  If you are going to be a leader in the greatest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; project in human history (or in any project for that matter) you have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learn and learn damn fast to be able to motivate and enroll people.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, actually I should expect that the seed AI project will have smaller total
<BR>
expenditures, frcom start to finish, than a typical major corporation's Y2K
<BR>
projects.  I used to think in terms of the greatest project in human history,
<BR>
but I no longer think that'll be necessary, and a damn good thing, as I don't
<BR>
think we're gonna *get* the largest budget in human history.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You need other human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beings to understand enough to keep you from getting lynched or shut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down for trying such a thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  A finite and rather small number of human beings, most of whom will
<BR>
almost certainly Get It on the first try.  If, hypothetically, I were a
<BR>
pessimistic and cynical person, then I were start saying things like:  &quot;And if
<BR>
I spend time talking to anyone else, then that just increases the probability
<BR>
that I'll get lynched or shut down.  Foresight tried to play nicey-nice with
<BR>
everyone, as a result of which they are now being screwed over by the National
<BR>
Nanotechnology Research Initiative.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You are so brilliant is so many ways but I think you have a lot to learn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about reaching and working with people.  The success of the project
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depends hugely on you learning that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wish I knew more about dealing with people, but I no longer give it as high
<BR>
a priority as I once did.
