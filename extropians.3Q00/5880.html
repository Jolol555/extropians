<P>Cashing in on biology Money problems? Blame evolution, says John L Casti.
<BR>
Some economic strategies are hard-wired
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Thursday August 24, 2000
<BR>
<P><P>How do our concepts of economic exchange arise out of our evolved brain? 
<BR>
Hard-core economists would argue that we are all ultra-rational profit
<BR>
maximisers, each out to get as much as we can with the minimal investment
<BR>
of resources. But in such a world of egoists, how can it be that
<BR>
cooperation ever comes about? Are there good evolutionary reasons for the
<BR>
behaviour we see every day, in which people forego selfish profits in
<BR>
favour of altruistic acts of charity?
<BR>
<P>According to the evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith of Sussex
<BR>
University, several major evolutionary transitions have occurred, each one
<BR>
leading to a stunning biological breakthrough. Economic concepts make
<BR>
their appearance in many of these long-ago transitions. For instance,
<BR>
cooperation is found in co-evolving viruses, division of labour appears in
<BR>
the form of cellular differentiation, and communication occurs in chemical
<BR>
signalling. 
<BR>
<P>Language and emotions are two central prerequisites for human economic
<BR>
transac tions. Homo economicus, the mythical rational utility maximiser,
<BR>
has been unmasked by experimental economist Ernst Fehr of the University
<BR>
of Zurich.
<BR>
<P>Fehr demonstrated how cooperation emerges among humans using The Public
<BR>
Goods game, which illustrates how self-interest hampers economic exchange. 
<BR>
The game involves four players, each given #10 by an experimenter, and
<BR>
asked to independently invest any part of this money into a common pool. 
<BR>
The experimenter then adds a similar amount to the pool and it is divided
<BR>
equally among the four participants. So if all four invest their total
<BR>
fortune they can each double their money.
<BR>
<P>But there is a very high temptation to freeload, since if one person
<BR>
invests nothing, while the others invest their total fortune, each
<BR>
contributor will receive #15, including the one who invested nothing. If
<BR>
this game is repeated, the players quickly learn to contribute very
<BR>
little, leading to minimal earnings.
<BR>
<P>The game changes dramatically, though, if at the end of each round the
<BR>
players have the option of punishing any player by imposing a fine. This
<BR>
is economically irrational, as the fines return to the experimenter, not
<BR>
to the punisher. The rules actually require that punishers have to pay
<BR>
half as much as the fine they impose (rather like informers to the tax
<BR>
authorities, who have their own tax return audited). 
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, the tendency to impose this kind of costly punishment is
<BR>
widespread, and has a very beneficial effect: players invest for fear of
<BR>
being punished. 
<BR>
<P>It is economic ties more than genetic ones that underpin human
<BR>
interactions. The division of labour, cooperation, and the exchange of
<BR>
goods and services take place between unrelated individuals all the time.
<BR>
The principal force driving these interactions is what biologists term
<BR>
'reciprocal altruism': I help you today because I expect you will help me
<BR>
tomorrow. However, this is direct reciprocation. 
<BR>
<P>In modern economies the link between donor and recipient is broken. Why
<BR>
bother to redress wrongs directed against third parties? The work of
<BR>
Manfred Milinski at the Max-Planck Institute in Ploen, Germany, offers
<BR>
insight into how this form of indirect altruism stems from the world of
<BR>
biology through the mechanisms of reputation and status. 
<BR>
<P>In Milinski's experiment, players interacted in pairs, each having the
<BR>
chance to perform an act of altruism or to be selfish and not do so. Each
<BR>
individual had a score, which rose if a player performed an altruistic act
<BR>
and fell in they did not. 
<BR>
<P>In a social group, those who are discriminating in their choice of
<BR>
strategies soon channel help to individuals with high scores. The
<BR>
assumption is that such help provides recipients with a benefit - four
<BR>
Swiss francs in the experiment - but at a cost to the donor - one or two
<BR>
Swiss francs. 
<BR>
<P>When the number of rounds of play was not known before the experiment
<BR>
began, and the number of players was large so that no two players were
<BR>
likely to encounter each other twice, the results were clear. Helping
<BR>
behaviour became widespread, and those who refused to help mostly did so
<BR>
when the player they were engaging had a low score. This showed that
<BR>
cooperation can be established as long as players have some way of knowing
<BR>
the score of whoever they interact with. 
<BR>
<P>The social and economic decisions of real-world humans are determined by a
<BR>
constellation of feelings and impulses, rather than cold, analytical,
<BR>
rational calculations. In all cultures there exist similar, and equally
<BR>
irrational, ideas of fairness. Behaviour deemed unfair inevitably leads to
<BR>
bitterness, anger, and conflict. Evolutionists convincingly argue that the
<BR>
capabilities for friendship, gratitude, and empathy are adaptive traits,
<BR>
since they increase reproductive success under normal social conditions. 
<BR>
<P>These primitive game theories demonstrate how such behavioural strategies
<BR>
can emerge in a population of competitors. Psychologists have devised
<BR>
numerous experiments based on these gaming models that show marked,
<BR>
non-random deviations from the purely rational behaviour espoused by
<BR>
mainstream economists. These deviations are systematic, indicating that
<BR>
behaviours such as thinking and feeling are guided by a set of simple,
<BR>
general, unconscious rules that are probably far more well-adapted to a
<BR>
hominid household than to a modern market economy. This can be dangerous.
