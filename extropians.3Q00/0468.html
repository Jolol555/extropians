<P>
I thought some of you might like a report about the Blois 2000
<BR>
Frontiers of Life (<A HREF="http://wwwusr.obspm.fr/confs/blois2000.html">http://wwwusr.obspm.fr/confs/blois2000.html</A>)
<BR>
conference.
<BR>
<P>I missed the first two 1/2 days because of an air traffic controller
<BR>
strike in Paris, so I can't comment on those sessions, which is
<BR>
unfortunate because there appear to have been some interesting
<BR>
nanotech related talks.
<BR>
<P>Most of the Evolution and Maintenance of Life in Extreme Environments
<BR>
and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life session was organic chemists
<BR>
so my &quot;Life at the Limits of Physical Laws&quot; presentation (aka M-brains
<BR>
and relatively immortal SIs) flew past the people there, but Gregory
<BR>
Benford at least liked it and indicated that more consideration should
<BR>
be given to these ideas.  Chris Chyba from the SETI Inst. (the session
<BR>
chair) is presumably still stewing over it :-?).
<BR>
<P>C. Lineweaver who is a reputable astrophysicist, gave a very interesting
<BR>
argument that there are something like a billion &quot;earths&quot; in our galaxy
<BR>
and 74% of them are up to a billion years older than our Earth(!).  The
<BR>
argument was based on the accumulation of metals in our galaxy and the
<BR>
excessive metallicity found in stars with &quot;hot&quot; jupiter planets.  Earth's
<BR>
start forming when the galactic metal abundance rises high enough (several
<BR>
billion years before the formation of our solar system) and stop forming
<BR>
when the metal abundance gets too high (resulting in hot jupiters that
<BR>
fling Earth's out of solar systems).
<BR>
<P>Chris Chyba gave a very interesting lecture on the probability that
<BR>
Europa has a watery ocean and might have enough free energy to allow
<BR>
life to evolve at a low density.
<BR>
<P>Gregory Benford made some good arguments that the galactic bulge
<BR>
should be a haven for &quot;older&quot; intelligent life and that if we want
<BR>
to look for becons, we should look more frequently towards the galactic
<BR>
center.
<BR>
<P>I posed thorny questions to J. Weissenbach from Genoscope (Fr.)
<BR>
and J. Beckman from Genethon (Fr.) regarding whether aging was
<BR>
a disease and whether we could expect rapid progress in understanding
<BR>
it now that the genome was done.  Weissenbach punted and Beckman
<BR>
said that &quot;aging was not a disease, it was part of life&quot; (and then
<BR>
explained the statement in a way that contradicted his earlier
<BR>
statements about the genetic components of heart disease, obesity, etc.).
<BR>
<P>The answers clearly indicate that genome researchers are fairly clueless
<BR>
about aging (though Beckman is to be acknowledged in that he at
<BR>
least understood that aging is due in part to the declining force of
<BR>
natural selection).
<BR>
<P>Shapiro's comments (re: molecular Turing Machines/Finate State Automata)
<BR>
indicate he is clearly a computer scientist that is thinking only in
<BR>
limited terms of extending current biotech tools (e.g. ribosomes) to
<BR>
create within-the-cell computers (previously mentioned in an EIList
<BR>
post I think).  He was reluctant to consider MEMS approaches following
<BR>
that curve to smaller sizes and seemed to have no knowledge regarding
<BR>
nanotech timelines (putting the date for his variation of the &quot;Doctor
<BR>
in a cell&quot; at around 2050).
<BR>
<P>Drake's presentation was pretty much a rehash of old perspectives
<BR>
with nothing new other than the inexpensive economics that are
<BR>
pushing the development and deployment of the hectacre radio astronomy/
<BR>
SETI array.  He did throw a bone to the optical SETI searches.  When I
<BR>
asked him about the problem of long signaling times by long-lived
<BR>
civilizations (his own ideas), he kind of punted by saying that presumably
<BR>
they would provide becons with signal times fast enough times for us to detect
<BR>
them.  Of course he didn't comment on why one would want to communicate with
<BR>
creatures (us) that are effectively lower than &quot;insects&quot; (to them).
<BR>
My impression was that the SETI folks are leaning very much on the
<BR>
&quot;leakage&quot; argument (we pick up other civilizations TV signals) without
<BR>
clear statements that our detection capabilities limit those to something
<BR>
around 50 ly, and intelligent life would have to be very abundant indeed for
<BR>
SETI as currently practiced to succeed.
<BR>
<P>The most striking thing was the almost complete absence of papers looking
<BR>
at the future rather than papers looking at the past.
