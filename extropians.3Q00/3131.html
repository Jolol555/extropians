<EM>&gt;      &gt;The GATT provides mechanisms under the WIPO to establish this internationally.

<EM>&gt; I'm no expert on GATT but I very much doubt the treaty says that, not that it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter if it did. Passing laws is easy, enforcing them is not.

<P>GATT has IP provisions, I suggest you read it.

<EM>&gt;     &gt;Shutting off the internet to countries that do not enact such laws and enforce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;them is easy to do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Easy to do? I think not, it would be almost as hard as making an effective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ABM system.
</EM><BR>
<P>What, you think there is actually a huge network of wires that is too
<BR>
vast for people to eliminate all connections? There is a surprisingly
<BR>
small number of cables connecting countries together, and even if you
<BR>
don't shut them off physically, dos attacks against all servers in those
<BR>
countries would not be difficult to set up either. Another thing to do
<BR>
is to remove those countries top level domains from recognition on
<BR>
servers and routers that have the most immediate connections to those
<BR>
countries, so any traffic to and from then is simply denied.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With a properly designed anonymous re-mailer or DC net NOBODY known

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;That doesn't shut down the internet, it merely removes players who refuse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;play by the rules, and who refuse to only deal with people who play by the rules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only way a ISP could guarantee that illegal activity was not going on is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shut down, exactly the same it true of the phone company.
</EM><BR>
<P>Guaranteeing is not the issue, its enforcing against those it does catch
<BR>
that is the issue. Your attitude is more of that bullshit 'if we can't
<BR>
do it perfectly, we shouldn't do it at all.'

<EM>&gt;     &gt;bill the software author for all royalties unpaid as a result of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;using his/her software.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know of no software that can only be used illegally, I know of no software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that can only be used legally. Are you going to jail the maker of a word processing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program because somebody used it to write a ransom note?
</EM><BR>
<P>That is not what we are talking about, and you ought to know that.
<BR>
People that write software like napster, which their main function is to
<BR>
facilitate IP piracy, should be billed for all the royalties that the
<BR>
users of that software are evading.

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
