<P><EM>&gt; About 5 years ago I listed 6 reasons why a macroscopic assembler,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a person on a assembly line, was doing a far more difficult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; task that requires much more brain power than a Nanotechnology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assembler ever would. I still think it's true, if it wasn't biology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wouldn't it?  Couldn't the millions of years of development work on
<BR>
DNA and the rest of the body have created something that performs a
<BR>
more difficult job than screwing in rivets?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1) The parts a macroscopic assembler uses would be very expensive, the parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    that Nanotechnology uses, atoms, are very cheap.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  But buildings are rather expensive also; beams are relatively
<BR>
cheap.  Why don't we just make robots build buildings (or at least
<BR>
their skeletons) from beams and rivets?  Or, more to the point: why is
<BR>
that substantially harder than building proportionately sized
<BR>
nano-products?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) A macroscopic assembler must use many thousands or millions of different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    types of parts and it must learn how to use all of them. At the most,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Nanotechnology uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    world almost everything we know of is made of only about 20 parts, and for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    life about 10.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're imagining nanotech operating on a very different level, I
<BR>
think, from the way most people in the field are imagining it.
<BR>
Drexler, for example, imagines machine-phase assembly to look an awful
<BR>
lot like macroscale assembly, as far as the number of parts are
<BR>
concerned; rather than fill Nanosystems with discussion of how pure
<BR>
carbon reacts and how we can use that to build complex polymers one
<BR>
monomer at a time, he fills his diamondoid chapter with sketches of
<BR>
designs for levers, struts, bearings, rivets, etc.
<BR>
<P>Why did he do this?  Probably because it's a hell of a lot easier to
<BR>
deal with, computationally speaking, than to try to do it the other
<BR>
way.  &quot;Chunking&quot; the problem like this helps to REDUCE the complexity
<BR>
of the problem, rather than to increase it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3) All the many different parts a macroscopic assembler must use are fragile,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    and fragile in different ways, the machine must learn the proper handling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    techniques for them all or it will destroy the parts before it can use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    them. There is no way you can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not true if you chunk the problem the way Drexler does; indeed, he
<BR>
spends a lengthy section of the book dicussing just when and how his
<BR>
bonds will break under stress.
<BR>
<P>But, again, returning to the macroscale building builder; while it's
<BR>
true that beams can and do break, so can nanoscale beams.  This looks
<BR>
to me like a difference with no difference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4) None of the parts in a macroscopic factory are absolutely identical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Despite our best efforts, individual variation still exists, and so we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    must deal with each part slightly differently and  compensate for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    variation in the assembly process if we want the finished product to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    properly, that often takes intelligence. On the  other hand, according to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the laws of Physics one hydrogen atom is absolutely identical to another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    hydrogen atom and can be treated in exactly the same way.  Atoms have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    scratches on them to tell them apart.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, suppose I have a set of beams for you that are identical enough
<BR>
that slight discrepencies in shape or size are irrelevant.  Does this
<BR>
make the project that much simpler?  Why can't we get robots to build
<BR>
buildings out of perfect-enough beams?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    domain. You may have to deal with a rod 27 carbon atoms long, or 28 atoms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    long, but you never have to worry about a rod 27.5601334 atoms long.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    A Macro assembler wouldn't have that luxury when it tried to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    something with an oak log.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, suppose the beams are 25 +/- 1% units long; does the
<BR>
problem really get that much easier?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 6) Most of the parts a macroscopic  assembler use would have to be very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    complex and the ways they interact with other macroscopic parts would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    even more complex. Think of the windshield of a car, it interacts poorly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    with the engine block, and even with the windshield frame the interaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    must be managed with great skill or you'll have a disaster. Nanotechnology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    is like building with Lego blocks, you can build structures of arbitrary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    complexity, yet there are only a few different types of blocks and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    interact with other blocks (bounds) in only a few different ways.
</EM><BR>
<P>And this?  This claim is just wrong.  Organic chemistry is
<BR>
substantially more complicated than Lego blocks, even in the machine phase.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, think of it this way: if macroscale objects interact in a
<BR>
complex way, why do you think smaller clumps of atoms wouldn't also?
