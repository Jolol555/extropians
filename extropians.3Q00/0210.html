<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am playing devil's advocate here... why aren't all you non-US folk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; moving here? Laying aside for the moment the INS/immigration issues-
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Possible reasons for not moving: being afraid of crime rates.  Preferring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to live in dense pedestrian-oriented cities, not boonie real estate or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suburban
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You could live in NYC if you prefer. It is quite safe if you live in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice area.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
1) Only so many people can live in NYC.  Large numbers of Europeans moving
<BR>
from London and Paris and Basel and Amsterdam into NYC/Boston/San Francsico
<BR>
just doesn't work.
<BR>
<P>2) So you live in a nice area (and pay extra for that), and learn to avoid
<BR>
visiting bad areas.  Or you can live in a city which doesn't have that sort of
<BR>
bad area, partly because of the nasty welfare and health care systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; deserts.  Not wishing to partake in a culture dependent upon cars (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cheap gas and subsidized roads, to trade cheap shots.)  Dependency on a
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nonsense, you can live pretty much anywhere and still get around by bicycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you really want to limit yourself to that. Or you could live in Europe
</EM><BR>
<P>This may be actually false, for parts of LA connected only by freeways.  I've
<BR>
been on a bus which spends two minutes on the freeway, apparently because
<BR>
there are no connecting streets.
<BR>
<P>And denser cities (think of it as making efficient use of the third dimension)
<BR>
make it easier to walk or bike.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; heavier). Let's face it: good cars = maximum mobility/freedom.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I'll remember that the next time I walk past the parking lots the downtown
<BR>
streets here turn into.  Or look out the window at the cars waiting to get
<BR>
onto the Bay Bridge.  Waiting, waiting, waiting...
<BR>
<P>Cars have their advantages.  They also have their costs.  Besides the obvious
<BR>
ones -- paying for the car, insuring the car, insuring yourself -- there's
<BR>
what having _lots_ of cars does to a place.  Parking problems.  (Or monetary
<BR>
cost.)  Gridlock.  If places are spaced out, to allow more parking, then
<BR>
that's more distance to drive, and people who'd otherwise have walked, biked,
<BR>
or taken the bus now start driving as well, eating up the parking space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Dependency... what would you have us all just walk around? At some point
</EM><BR>
<P>The question was why people might decline moving to the US.  I gave a reason.
<BR>
People who enjoy commuting through Silicon Valley can stay there; I'll stay in
<BR>
San Francisco.  And others will stay in cities with good public
<BR>
transportation.  The market at work, yes?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; we have to wed ourselves to technology and its attendant risks.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
We do?  We can't say &quot;no, this isn't worth it, this is bad tool for the job&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; a much higher baseline concern for the quality of food.  A feeling that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More FUD
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I wasn't talking about health quality.  I was talking about taste.  I haven't
<BR>
eaten in Europe, but I've heard this from a lot of people who have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Europeans are better educated and more interesting, or that it's easier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; find those who are, in coffeehouses and such.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are willing to sacrifice so many things to have this &quot;feeling&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ability to visit a coffeehouse in the flesh (vs. virtual chats) then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you should re-evaluate your logic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the very first item on the list was a claim that Americans were more
<BR>
interesting; this last item is a suggestion that Europeans are more
<BR>
interesting.  Works both way, yes?
<BR>
<P>And you think virtual chat works the same way as talking to people in person,
<BR>
in coffeehouses or elsewhere?  The memory of Extropy #3 comes to mind...
