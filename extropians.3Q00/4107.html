<EM>&gt; Einstein worked with math, but he called himself a theoretical physicist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, he used mainly physical problems and speculations about such to
<BR>
guide the math and, from what I've read, he was a poor mathematician.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Darwin worked with geology, but he was called an evolutionist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Darwin was actually what we would call a naturalist.  He was deeply
<BR>
influenced by the geologist Lyell, whose notion of gradualism -- viz., the
<BR>
same processes at work now were working in the past to create all the
<BR>
geological formations we see today -- had an impact of Darwin's theory of
<BR>
evolution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Wright brothers worked with machines,
</EM><BR>
<P>They worked on bicycles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but they were called inventors of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; airplane.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do think of the airplane as an invention and most people at the time of
<BR>
the brothers Wright would probably have agreed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Karl Marx worked in a library, but he didn't call himself a librarian (he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started a cult).
</EM><BR>
<P>I won't argue with this, though I don't want to diss Marx completely.  His
<BR>
view of dialectics is quite interesting, though he did not, sadly, apply it
<BR>
to his own philosophy.  But if he had logged on to Priceline.com or heard
<BR>
William Shatner singing about it, who knows what he might have applied the
<BR>
money he would have saved to.
