<EM>&gt; I've heard some very nasty things about the company that makes the brown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fizzy drink and dead union officials, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Dead union officials, AFAICR, due to their mafia connections.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and certain pumped up shoe makers have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had their butts whipped in recent years over sweat shop labour.
</EM><BR>
<P>Did they kill anybody? No. The anti-nike PR is from unions that are not allowed
<BR>
in the countries Nike manufactures in. Not that they don't want the workers
<BR>
represented, its that they don't want American mafia in their countries. Nike
<BR>
employees make several times what they could possibly make elsewhere in their
<BR>
country as unskilled laborers, and the US unions cannot say anything against
<BR>
that, so they claim they are working in sweatshops instead. Here's a clue:
<BR>
Vietnam is one huge sweatshop, its the natural environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always the baby formula manufacturer, who's name shall remain nestle'd in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; secrecy, that employs (or at least used to employ) dastardly tactics to move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; third world mums from breastfeeding to formula, thus causing the deaths of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many tiny tots due to direct exposure to the rotten local drinking water, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else starvation due to inability to afford the stuff (thanks for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mamaries). 
</EM><BR>
<P>So Nestle is employing armies of soldiers to hold mothers at gunpoint to prevent
<BR>
them from breastfeeding? No? Well then, what allegedly 'dastardly' tactics are
<BR>
they?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or you might mention a certain org beloved of closer circles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which thinks it's ok to make food seed with an off-switch (or which, more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accurately I think, requires secret gunk to turn it on).
</EM><BR>
<P>Which has killed how many people? None. Damn, they are just 'dastards' arent'
<BR>
they?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I think the only crime against humanity that MS has perpetrated is VB.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The bastards!
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, making programming easier for people is sure a crime to someone... notably
<BR>
C++ programmers who can't command automatic six figure salaries.
