<EM>&gt; To reiterate what I said earlier - the biggest bug in our so-called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free-market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that everything is up for grabs (freedom, justice), where he with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money wins.
</EM><BR>

<P>It's not a bug, it's a feature.
<BR>
<P>The usual method of coping with this &quot;bug&quot; is to do a bit of redefinition,
<BR>
by saying that only those who deserve to get money actually get it. It's
<BR>
their reward for greatness. If they were undeserving, they'd have no money.
<BR>
<P>Of course, this means that those with no money are undeserving. Simple
<BR>
really.
<BR>
<P>So maybe freedom, justice, power, privilege, are all up for grabs. That's
<BR>
good! It means they actually go to the deserving. If people really deserved
<BR>
justice, say, they'd make a lot of money, and buy it. If they can't afford
<BR>
it, they are obviously lazy or stupid, or else haven't set their priorities
<BR>
correctly. There's a great discussion of this idea in the archives
<BR>
somewhere, centering on a ficticious human liver-eating billionarre, which
<BR>
is rather enlightening.
<BR>
<P>So where's the problem?
<BR>
<P>Emlyn
<BR>
Let them eat cake.
