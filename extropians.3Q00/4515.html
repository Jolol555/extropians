Zero,
<BR>
<P>Sorry I have no mastery over technology, esp. that of 'programing' to
<BR>
enable posing these questions elegantly.
<BR>
<P>How will AI machines differ from humans? How will the 'wants' and goals differ?
<BR>
<P>The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is the human 'hardwired' survival
<BR>
function. Humans  do not need to want to survive. Intelligence is different
<BR>
ingredient. The human mind has intelligence, that is, the abiltity to
<BR>
'program and reprogram' itself via learning and learning is also what will
<BR>
make AI software intelligent (I). Ability may manifest without the desire
<BR>
to use it.
<BR>
<P>Primary human 'Wants' or desires involve:
<BR>
1. - the avoidance of suffering (physical &amp; mental pain) by increasing
<BR>
awareness and ability to predict harm's immediacy and eventuality by
<BR>
assessing short and long-term consequences.
<BR>
2. - seeking pleasure.
<BR>
<P>The first set of 'wants' hone thinking and intelligence - which in
<BR>
themselves may be sources of great pleasure while the second set of 'wants'
<BR>
can easily corrupt the ability to 'reprogram' oneself.
<BR>
<P>Once the survival function is removed, What motivation remains? What
<BR>
exactly is it that all of you will be doing in those endless post-human
<BR>
days? Will you need to invent something to want? Are you now a pleasure
<BR>
seeker or a pain avoider? Please do not assume these issues are
<BR>
self-evident.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;What is your motivating want? Is survival enough?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since you use the singular &quot;want&quot; I take it that you mean what is my supreme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;desire, no?  Well obviously my supreme need/want/desire is to survive.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without that no other desire can be achieved.  Is survival &quot;enough?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly not, but it is the one need upon which every other one depends.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- -Zero
