<EM>&gt; &gt; Uh, actually this argument fails to sway because it defines theft in

<EM>&gt;very

<EM>&gt;but

<EM>&gt; &gt; you certainly are stealing my profit.  If you desire something that I

<EM>&gt; &gt; energy producing (like, er, money for instance.)

Actually, it just occurred to me that I get about as much enjoyment at the spa where I work out from watching all the hot female hard bodies in action as I do from music - perhaps more.  Perhaps I should be paying them a royalty?  They certainly put a lot of work into getting to the point that I can enjoy the sight of them, and it was probably done at least partially for the purpose of creating that reaction in the right man.

<P>I remember a Chinese legend about a very wise judge who had in his court a furious baker who said a poor man in his village would come and stand outside his bakery everyday to enjoy the smell.  And the man did not even recompense the baker for this!!  The judge ordered that the poor man jingle the change in his pockets.  &quot;You have now been paid!,&quot; was the response of the judge...
