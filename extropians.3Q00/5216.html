<P><EM>&gt;Another good thing about email is that the potential exists to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being identified as a particular sex.  Many women I've talked to (in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact, I believe every woman I've ever talked to about this has had this

<EM>&gt;experience) have reported the following sort ot thing:
</EM><BR>
<P>Your examples are of in-person interactions, but I understand it's common
<BR>
in other contexts.  For example, in how manuscripts are treated by scientific
<BR>
journals or publishing houses.  
<BR>
<P>(OTOH, in publishing, there are genres whose authors are presumptively female.  
<BR>
Male authors have to hide behind a pseudonym.)
<BR>
<P>(Also, I have been in several situations where I was not welcome, or was
<BR>
not treated equally, because I am male.  I do not claim that the converse 
<BR>
problems are of equal significance to those experienced by women but they do 
<BR>
exist.)
<BR>
<P>For you and other women in the group:
<BR>
<P>Does the differential behaviour Barbara describes occur in all situations?  
<BR>
If not, what factors (context, gender mix, education level of participants, 
<BR>
your age or age of other participants, etc.) seem positively or negatively 
<BR>
correlated with this?  Or, more plainly, where have you been treated the 
<BR>
best/worst, and do you have any ideas as to what made the difference?  
<BR>
<P>Do you see the same thing on-line?  How does extropians compare with other 
<BR>
online groups and with the physical world?  Have you tried participating with 
<BR>
a male or indeterminate-gender persona?  What differences in treatment did you 
<BR>
notice, if any?
<BR>
<P>Emlyn, Robin, and others with names of indeterminate gender:
<BR>
<P>What have you noticed about these issues through having a name that leads you
<BR>
to be mistaken for female?  Did the way you were treated change when they 
<BR>
learned you were male?
