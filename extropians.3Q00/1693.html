<P>&lt;&lt; [Moving between the universes] doesn't make sense at all. If you 'moved'
<BR>
&nbsp;from one universe to another, even a perfectly identical one, you would
<BR>
&nbsp;notice instantly, because there would be another copy of you there. (If the
<BR>
&nbsp;copy was in the same location, you would 'move' into in the same position
<BR>
&nbsp;and there would be a large bang.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;This sort of thing never happens. Moreover, it is forbidden by quantum
<BR>
&nbsp;theory (except, as Ant said, in the presence of time travel devices). &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>One of Max Tegmark's hypothesis is that there would only be one, &quot;you&quot;  
<BR>
observer per cosm since the qm function would revolve around you. Hence, 
<BR>
someone who dies suddenly of a heart attack at age 77 in this universe, would 
<BR>
wake up to see that he had survived and was recovering, nicely, in another. 
<BR>
In the previous universe, his fellows would be laying him to rest.

<P>One of the more interesting short stories in SciFi writer, Larry Niven's 
<BR>
collection is &quot;On A Foggy Night&quot;. This is part of his All The Myriad Ways 
<BR>
Collection, he wrote back in the late 1960's, that dealt with parallel 
<BR>
universes/worlds.  Also, Stephen Kings's Roland and the Dark Tower evolved 
<BR>
over the decades to encompass all King's works including the Regulators World 
<BR>
to the Cujo World to The Stand World.
