<P><EM>&gt;  They need to wake up and realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that they can't just create words and music and art--they actually do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have to do some of the work of creating money themselves, and they have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to throw away the idiotic &quot;art for art's sake&quot; mentality that has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  keeping them enslaved for so long.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>No, suits are enslaved, artists are free. You have it so backwards it's funny!
<BR>
<P>We're doing what we want and getting paid.
<BR>
<P>Duke Ellington put it well, when the suit got mad at him cuz his records were 
<BR>
not selling as many that month.
<BR>
<P>Duke, who had class-  said somthin' like,  that's not my job.My job is to 
<BR>
make the quality music, yours is to sell it. Get back to work and quit 
<BR>
bugging me.
<BR>
<P>Any artisan who is making their living doing what they want is to me, a 
<BR>
success.
<BR>
<P>Big talk Lee, cuz you're a big man... you try painting or recording music ten 
<BR>
to fifteen hours a day, and then going out to sell it in your &quot;spare time&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>Then after you have a body of work that I can look at, and a track record of 
<BR>
making money, I will be willing to discuss it.
<BR>
<P>An artist &quot;taking it laying down&quot; when we pay our manager or agent? Not if 
<BR>
we're getting a very good service in return.
