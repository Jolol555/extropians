<P><EM>&gt; As it gets brighter and more human level or surpasses us what makes you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that argument is going to look like anything but the mouthings of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slave-holder to the AI?  You don't buy and sell conscious entities of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human and greater level.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's right. For most of my life they've bought and sold my intellectual
<BR>
output.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Robots are self-defining if they are evolving toward and through human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level. There is no such thing as preprogrammed immutable robotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior.  Can you program humans to be always friendly?  No?  Well you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have far less of a chance to do so with truly smart robots.
</EM><BR>
<P>Calm down Sam. We won't know until we try.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...AI and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumans will develop and should simply because they are more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent and capable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe. Maybe not. You can't know that until it becomes real.

in our air and water that are doing it.&quot;
