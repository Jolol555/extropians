<P>
in order to avoid deception i now state that nigel
<BR>
hammersted is not the name by which i am usually
<BR>
called.
<BR>
<P>thus far in our discussion, we have considered the
<BR>
question of why individual humans are inclined to
<BR>
believe in spirit. this inclination appears in all
<BR>
human populations and thus must have arisen early in
<BR>
the evolution of the species.
<BR>
<P>let us change our perspective for a moment to view the
<BR>
human as a social animal and ask what survival value
<BR>
belief in spirit might have had for early human social
<BR>
groups. the following characteristics common to most
<BR>
religions come to mind: 
<BR>
<P>1. the initiated think of their diety as *the* only
<BR>
legitimate diety; 
<BR>
<P>2. followers of a certain diety tend to look upon
<BR>
non-followers as lesser humans, or possibly
<BR>
sub-humans, ie. *this* group following *the* diety is
<BR>
the only game in town;
<BR>
<P>3.  from 2 follows the dependence of the individual on
<BR>
the group and his willingness to subdue his individual
<BR>
preferences in favor of group preferences. 
<BR>
<P>4. if belief in the diety includes belief in an
<BR>
after-life, followers of the diety are often willing
<BR>
to sacrifice their effort, assets, or lives for the
<BR>
group; 
<BR>
<P>5. it is easier for a leader to establish himself as
<BR>
leader if he can convince his followers that he has a
<BR>
special relationship with the diety; and
<BR>
<P>6. the divine guidance of the leader allows him to
<BR>
more effectively organize and direct the activities of
<BR>
his followers.
<BR>
<P>the 6 characteristics listed above would seem to
<BR>
greatly contribute to the ability of human groups to
<BR>
pool the resources and abilities of individuals in
<BR>
fighting other groups.  it would also allow for the
<BR>
formation of a &quot;preistly&quot; elite which might be freed
<BR>
from the tasks of routine maintenance in order to
<BR>
pursue their groups version of the arts and sciences.
