From: &quot;Joe Dees&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joedees@addall.com?Subject=Re:%20GUNS:%20Re:%20Why%20Here?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009201545.IAA10259@well.com&gt;">joedees@addall.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A well-regulated militia was intended to protect the powers of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;states against federal usurpation (which is why states were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supposed to be their regulators); this was also the reason for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;10th amendment (that all powers not specifically granted to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;federal government should devolve to the states).  However, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Civil War proved that states could not exercise a right to secede
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the Union, and the state National Guards keep their weapons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in armories, unlike the militias, which depended upon the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citizen-soldiers to furnish their own.
</EM><BR>
<P>The purpose of the Second Amendment is so that individuals acting
<BR>
either alone or in conjunction with their neighbors can protect
<BR>
themselves not only from criminals, but from any form of
<BR>
government, federal, state, city, what have you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But gun control was not practiced by those governments - citizen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disarmament was.  There should be no argument that while sane and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;law-abiding citizens should have the right to keep and bear, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the means to commit quick and easy long-range mass murder should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be, as much as possible, kept out of the hands of kids, criminals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and psychos, who cannot discharge the resposibilities concomittant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with such rights in a responsible manner.  Certainly they should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not be able to simply walk into a Wal-Mart and legally purchase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such killing tools at a moment's notice.  This is the type of gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;control that I, and all reasonable people, support.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've pointed out at length a number of times, it is already
<BR>
against existing federal law for kids, criminals, and psychos to
<BR>
buy or be in possession of firearms.
<BR>
<P>A fact you continue to ignore.
<BR>
<P>Here in Illinois we already have:
<BR>
<P>1)Licensing
<BR>
<P>2)Waiting periods
<BR>
<P>3)Instant Background checks
<BR>
<P>4) Chicago has a 20 year complete ban on handguns (except for the
<BR>
mayor and city council).
<BR>
<P>Plus a variety of other laws, all to no effect.
