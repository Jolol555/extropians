<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; At some point, people will get genetic programming to the point where
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can make formal specs for a bit of a system (a component), with
</EM><BR>
rigourous
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; definitions of the pre-built pieces (components) that system depends on
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the interface it will provide, and you will be able to evolve it.
</EM><BR>
Arguably
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that technique could build some very complex systems. Eventually you
</EM><BR>
might
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be able to evolve the design, as well as the implementation; and then we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; begin to move into uncharted territory. Yet I still think that, even
</EM><BR>
then,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there'll be a level for humans, hacking away at something which is still
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; amenable to automation, standing on the generated systems and reaching
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the stars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree.  So why aren't we out building that system today?  Wanna put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; together a business plan and go looking for funding?  Seriously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P><P>You can't say this to me... you thought I was a VB programmer (oh the
<BR>
shame)!  And you were going to slap me, geez, I've got my eye on you. Never
<BR>
turn your back on a slapper.
<BR>
<P>Well, I'm not a VB programmer, but I'm still seriously underqualified to do
<BR>
more than rant vaguely about genetic programming. Eugene has a passing
<BR>
familiarity with this stuff; got a status report on state-of-the-art for us?
<BR>
<P>I'm a bit afraid that the business plan would look something like:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 - Get lots o money
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - Spend lots o money doing heaps of cool research into genetic
<BR>
programming, play around with oh so excellent equipment, discover some
<BR>
excellent stuff, have a bloody fantastic time
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 - Run out of money with no products/market to show for it,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 - get a slapping (eek) from the VC(s)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 - Reputation in ruins, become a tramp, scavenge in bins, waiting for
<BR>
the singularity
<BR>
<P>Emlyn, die hard optimist
