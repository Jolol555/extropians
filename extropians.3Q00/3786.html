Another remote possibility is a conjecture that all the information you were, is somehow stored automatically in the Universe. Hence, the replaying of such an occurence of our lifetimes, world history, would re-initiate the reality that we know. That would be when an outside force could mannipulate the spacetime we have (are) experiencing. This is alikeable, idea, but is it falsifiable?

My biological body, as such, will die.  It may be the case that I can
<BR>
store a copy of it elsewhere, and use that copy to reconstruct me when
<BR>
my current body fails.  But even if that happens, the copy will not be
<BR>
exact; the bodies will be different.
<BR>
<P>The information stored in the body, of course, need not die.  It can
<BR>
be replicated exactly, backed up, preserved.  The information has, if
<BR>
not an infinite lifespan, then a very very long one.
<BR>
<P>If you think that you are your current body, if you think that you die
<BR>
if your body dies, (even if there's another copy on hand or ready to
<BR>
go,) then the fact that the information stored in your body can be
<BR>
preserved will not lead you to think that you have a chance at
<BR>
immortality.
<BR>
<P>With that having been said, people have taken great pains to achieve a
<BR>
lot less and called that immortality.  Immortality in one's works, for
<BR>
example.  In one's family line.  In the memories of others.  While I'm
<BR>
not suggesting that you HAVE to call it &quot;immortality&quot; if I make a copy
<BR>
of all the information stored in your body, I think you do have to
<BR>
admit, it's the closest you'll ever be able to get.
<BR>
<P>This leads me to conclude that whether you believe that you are your
<BR>
current body or not, your best chance at immortality in the material
<BR>
world is the recording and storing of your body in a replicable form,
<BR>
because your current body will die.
<BR>
<P>When we can figure out how to do this, we'll be right near
<BR>
Singularity.
<BR>
<P>---------------
<BR>
<P>I've heard a number of different charts to a variety of different
<BR>
things that might be called &quot;Singularity.&quot;  There are large deviations
<BR>
between them; one of the largest rifts is the divide between those who
<BR>
think that we should build an AI to figure out how to do the relevant
<BR>
recording, (or, to be more precise, build a seed AI and hope that it
<BR>
performs the relevant recording), and those who think that we should
<BR>
try to upload ourselves without help from AIs; that, if we do employ
<BR>
AIs to help us, we should only use those AIs stupid enough to be
<BR>
completely controlled by us and to serve our bidding unflinchingly.
<BR>
<P>(We might also try a little bit of simple biological enhancement to
<BR>
hurry us along either path.)
<BR>
<P>Either route will require a lot of thought, and a lot of intelligence.
<BR>
We have market mechanisms and governments to coordiate this work for
<BR>
now; this might be sufficient to bring us a seed AI before we blow
<BR>
ourselves up, if seed AIs are pretty easy, but it's not enough if seed
<BR>
AIs are very hard.  Uploading is hard by everyone's estimates.
<BR>
<P>We'll get around to solving one or both of these problems eventually,
<BR>
but as far as I'M concerned, this problem has a time limit.  If this
<BR>
problem isn't solved within my lifetime, I have no use for the
<BR>
solution.  If it isn't solved before we blow ourselves up, then it's
<BR>
no use to anybody.
<BR>
<P>Other than biologically enhancing humans (non-PC, forbidden almost
<BR>
everywhere), acquiring funding (either by performing useful work or by
<BR>
begging for it, even begging the government), or actual lab work, what
<BR>
more can be done to bring one of these two about SOON?
<BR>
<P>The answer is borganization, in which one or more intelligent people
<BR>
get their heads together and think as a single entity of unified
<BR>
intelligence.  (Some cybernetics are probably required, but certainly
<BR>
not the clunky stuff you saw on Star Trek.)  The market and, to a
<BR>
lesser extent, the government, is designed to coordinate our efforts
<BR>
in this way, but it does so slowly and inefficiently.  Direct neural
<BR>
inputs and outputs coupled with even a mechanism as simplistic as an
<BR>
e-cash market would lead to thoughts and conclusions many times faster
<BR>
than our society can output.  Everything would happen faster,
<BR>
including our science.
<BR>
<P>If we're trying to build a seed, borganizing will get us there
<BR>
faster.  If we're trying to upload, borganizing will get us THERE
<BR>
faster, too.
<BR>
<P>Is borganizing easier (or faster) than simply uploading, or than
<BR>
building a seed?  I very much think so in the case of uploading, and I
<BR>
largely believe so in the case of building a seed.  Uploading already
<BR>
looks like it will be too hard a project to win the race against my
<BR>
death.  If it requires nanotech, then we risk that nanotech being
<BR>
abused before it can be used effectively to upload me.  If uploading
<BR>
does not require nanotech, then the sort of technologies which would
<BR>
be required for borganization seem to me to be enabling technologies
<BR>
for uploading.
<BR>
<P>As for building a seed, I happen to hold a fairly pessimistic view on
<BR>
the question of how long it will take before we get our seed; I worry
<BR>
that we won't get it before we blow ourselves up.  My pessimism aside,
<BR>
it should also be noted that borganization, if not called
<BR>
&quot;borganization,&quot; is also a substantially lower future shock level than
<BR>
seed AI, especially when you see it as a simple trend of accelerating
<BR>
communications.  This is mostly based on hunches, which is why I
<BR>
suggest that I only &quot;largely believe&quot; that borganizing will be easier
<BR>
than building a seed.
<BR>
<P>So, right now, I think borganization is my very best chance to survive
<BR>
the death of my body.  What do you think?
