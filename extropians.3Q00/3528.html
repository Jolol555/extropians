<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the way the money goes
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illustration: Brett

<BR>
<P><P>Life's so unfair. The rich get richer, while the rest of
<BR>
&nbsp;us just scrape by. Is society to blame or are deeper
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forces at work, asks Mark Buchanan 
<BR>
<P>WHY do rich people have all the money? This may sound like the world's
<BR>
silliest question, but it's not. In every society, most of the wealth
<BR>
falls into the hands of a minority. People often write this off as a
<BR>
fact of life--something we can do nothing about--but economists have
<BR>
always struggled to explain why the wealthy take such a big slice of
<BR>
the pie.
<BR>
<P>If Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and Marc Mézard are right, it is more than a
<BR>
fact of life: it's a law of nature. These two scientists have
<BR>
discovered a link between the physics of materials and the movements
<BR>
of money, a link that explains why wealth is distributed in much the
<BR>
same way in all modern economies. Their theory holds out a scrap of
<BR>
hope to the poor of the world: there may be some surprising ways to
<BR>
make society a bit more equal. And it promises a new fundamental
<BR>
science of money.  Economic theory is about to grow up.
<BR>
<P>In the 19th century, economists were certain that each society would
<BR>
have a unique distribution of wealth, depending on the details of its
<BR>
economic structure. But they were dumbfounded in 1897 by the claim of
<BR>
a Paris-born engineer named Vilfredo Pareto. The statistics, he
<BR>
insisted, prove otherwise. Not only do a filthy-rich minority always
<BR>
hog most of the wealth, but the mathematical form of the distribution
<BR>
is the same everywhere.
<BR>
<P>To get a feel for Pareto's law, suppose that in Germany or Japan or
<BR>
the US you count up how many people have, say, $10 000. Next, repeat
<BR>
the count for many other values of wealth (W), both large and small,
<BR>
and finally plot your results on a graph. You will find that there are
<BR>
only a few extremely rich people, and that the number of people
<BR>
increases as W gets smaller--at least until you get down to those with
<BR>
almost no wealth at all. This is exactly what Pareto found: the number
<BR>
of people having wealth W is proportional to 1/WE. Pareto found that
<BR>
the exponent E was always between 2 and 3 (see Diagram) for every
<BR>
European country he looked at, from agrarian Russia to industrial
<BR>
England. And up-to-date statistics show the same thing.
<BR>
<P>This distribution means that most of the wealth gathers in the pockets
<BR>
of a small fraction of the people. In the US, for example, 20 per cent
<BR>
of the people own 80 per cent of the wealth. In Britain and in the
<BR>
nations of Western Europe the numbers are similar. The shape of the
<BR>
graph seems to be universal.
<BR>
<P>For over a century, this universal law of wealth distribution has
<BR>
defied explanation, many economists simply putting it down to the
<BR>
inherent distribution of people's abilities. The truth may be simpler.
<BR>
<P>Economic theories have for years been founded on all sorts of dubious
<BR>
assumptions: that markets are in equilibrium, for example, or that
<BR>
people behave with perfect rationality. These assump- tions simplify
<BR>
economists' intricate equations, but they often lead to rather
<BR>
peculiar conclusions. There is even a &quot;no trades&quot; theorem, says
<BR>
Bouchaud, that in an economy where all the participants are perfectly
<BR>
rational, no trade should ever take place. So Bouchaud and Mézard are
<BR>
pioneering a totally different approach. They are going back to
<BR>
basics, trying to get by with an absolute minimum of assumptions.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Ten years ago,&quot; says Mézard, speaking from his office at Paris-Sud
<BR>
University, &quot;Jean-Philippe was one of the first physicists to get
<BR>
interested in finance.&quot; Questioning many traditional ideas, he at
<BR>
first met resistance. Since then, however, Bouchaud has built a
<BR>
company dealing in risk management that has won the attention and
<BR>
respect of the financial industry. Now at the Centre d'Etudes de
<BR>
Saclay in Paris, he and Mézard are setting their sights on a more
<BR>
ambitious goal: to build a theory of economics from the ground up.
<BR>
<P>An economy is just a large number of people who can trade with each
<BR>
other. Each individual has a certain amount of money he or she can
<BR>
invest or use to buy the services or goods of others. This is all
<BR>
beyond argument.  Things get more contentious when you try to turn
<BR>
these words into precise equations. Who trades with whom?  Which
<BR>
investments pay off and which do not?
<BR>
<P>Bouchaud and Mézard start from ground zero, with only one assumption:
<BR>
life is unpredictable. Buy some stocks and you might get a healthy
<BR>
return or a devastating loss; returns on investments are random. The
<BR>
trade network is also haphazard. Each person trades with a few others
<BR>
chosen at random from the population. &quot;Our idea,&quot; says Bouchaud, &quot;is
<BR>
to see how much we can explain on the basis of little more than pure
<BR>
noise.&quot;
<BR>
<P>With these few ingredients, the model seems to contain almost nothing
<BR>
at all. &quot;In its basic points,&quot; says Mézard, &quot;it's really trivial.&quot;
<BR>
There are many ways to build these basic elements into some equations,
<BR>
but fortunately the researchers had another clue.
<BR>
<P>A guiding principle of physics is the notion of invariance. Rotate a
<BR>
circle about its centre, and its shape remains unchanged. This is what
<BR>
makes a circle an especially simple and important shape in geometry.
<BR>
Similarly, the fundamental equations of physics are invariant under
<BR>
the action of certain mathematical operations, making them special
<BR>
cases in the space of all possible equations. Newton's laws of
<BR>
mechanics don't change if you alter the velocities of every body by an
<BR>
equal amount; otherwise, the physics you saw would change depending on
<BR>
how fast you were moving.
<BR>
<P>The economic equivalent of this is that a theory should produce the
<BR>
same results if you change the units of currency. &quot;This is what we try
<BR>
to explain to our children,&quot; he says, &quot;when they complain that their
<BR>
pocket money will go down when we shift to euros.&quot;  Consequently,
<BR>
Bouchaud and Mézard wrote down the simplest equations they could find
<BR>
that were invariant with changes in currency.
<BR>
<P>Getting equations is one thing; solving them, another.  There are
<BR>
millions of people in an economy, and that means millions of
<BR>
equations, which is why economists have tended to shun this &quot;bottom
<BR>
up&quot; approach.  Bouchaud and Mézard made their task easier by keeping
<BR>
the ingredients of their model so simple, but they were still left
<BR>
with a daunting task. Then, earlier this year, they became the
<BR>
beneficiaries of a miraculous mathematical coincidence.
<BR>
<P>As &quot;condensed matter&quot; physicists, the pair have for two decades been
<BR>
investigating the properties of solids and liquids, substances in
<BR>
which the atoms or molecules are crammed together. The traditional
<BR>
subjects of this field are materials such as pure metals and water,
<BR>
whose particles settle into a well-defined state such as an ordered
<BR>
crystal. But since the 1970s, researchers have been increasingly
<BR>
intrigued by &quot;ill-condensed&quot; matter in which competing forces
<BR>
frustrate this condensation. In this class of materials--which
<BR>
includes glass, dirty alloys and polymers--the particles can end up in
<BR>
a vast number of disordered but more or less equivalent
<BR>
configurations.
<BR>
<P>Two competing forces
<BR>
<P>To overcome some of the mathematical difficulties in the theories of
<BR>
these materials, physicists have invented a simple &quot;toy model&quot; called
<BR>
the directed polymer.  Imagine a long wire (the polymer) lying on a
<BR>
landscape that undulates up and down at random (click on thumbnail
<BR>
below for diagram). The wire is tethered at one end to a post. Gravity
<BR>
will tend to pull it down into the valleys, but as the landscape is
<BR>
random, the wire will have to bend to do so. So two forces--gravity
<BR>
and the wire's desire to stay straight--compete with one another.
<BR>
<P>As a result, the wire has to compromise: running through the valleys,
<BR>
so long as that doesn't entail too much bending, and, whenever the
<BR>
path becomes too tortuous, arching up over a pass to seek a straighter
<BR>
route.  There is no obvious &quot;best path&quot; for it to follow.
<BR>
<P>Many physical systems behave in a similar way. Take a magnetic field
<BR>
line, for example, as it tries to slip through a high-temperature
<BR>
superconductor. Left alone, it would follow a straight path. But these
<BR>
materials contain defects--analogous to the valleys and peaks--that
<BR>
attract or repel the lines.  So the path they take is some compromise
<BR>
between going straight through and swinging by attractive defects.
<BR>
<P>In such real, physical problems, working out the details of the
<BR>
compromise is difficult. In 1988, however, physicists Bernard Derrida
<BR>
and Herbert Spohn of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris solved a
<BR>
version of the directed-polymer problem exactly. There is one extra
<BR>
crucial element in the problem: temperature. In seeking some path
<BR>
across the random landscape, for example, the wire also puts up with a
<BR>
continual buffeting from air molecules, which knock it about from one
<BR>
path to another. The buffeting grows more vigorous with increasing
<BR>
temperature, and, as it turns out, the strength of this storm
<BR>
determines how the wire manages its compromise between going straight
<BR>
across and staying in the valleys.
<BR>
<P>&quot;When the temperature is high,&quot; says Mézard, &quot;the peaks and valleys
<BR>
have little effect.&quot; The buffeting is so violent that the polymer
<BR>
largely ignores the landscape, and flaps about all over the place. As
<BR>
the temperature falls, however, there comes a point at which the
<BR>
buffeting is no longer strong enough to drive the polymer over the
<BR>
landscape's peaks. Suddenly, the peaks and valleys become far more
<BR>
influential, and the polymer gets stuck in place, trapped along one
<BR>
irregular path. This sudden condensation is like the freezing of
<BR>
glass, or the pinning in place of a magnetic field line.
<BR>
<P>Mézard and Bouchaud have now discovered that the equations for this
<BR>
directed polymer model are identical to those for their economy
<BR>
(Physica A, vol 282, p 536; xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cond-mat/0002374). So to
<BR>
solve their equations they need do no more than pluck out some gems
<BR>
from the physics literature. And what these equations show is that
<BR>
under normal conditions, their economy follows Pareto's law.
<BR>
<P>To see how the model economy and a directed polymer are related takes
<BR>
a little imagination. Start with the irregular landscape, and throw a
<BR>
whole bunch of polymers across it. Let them settle down, and take a
<BR>
snapshot. This is now a picture of the economy over time.
<BR>
<P>Think of the people in the economy occupying positions on the y-axis
<BR>
of the landscape, and progressing to the right over time (see Diagram,
<BR>
p 24). A polymer plots the path of some quantity of money as it moves
<BR>
from person to person. So at any point, the wealth of a particular
<BR>
person is determined by the number of polymers that cross over their
<BR>
y-value.
<BR>
<P>The irregular returns on investments are reflected in the ruggedness
<BR>
of the landscape: deep valleys are places where there tends to be more
<BR>
money, the returns in investments being high; peaks are where
<BR>
investors fare badly and money is rare. The vigour of trade--how
<BR>
easily money flows between people--is analogous to the
<BR>
temperature. &quot;The wealth follows a kind of random walk,&quot; says
<BR>
Bouchaud.
<BR>
<P>There is, however, more than one kind of random walk.  Which kind
<BR>
wealth follows depends on how &quot;hot&quot; the economy is. When trading is
<BR>
easy, and the irregularity of returns on investment not too severe,
<BR>
the economy behaves like a polymer at high temperature. Just as the
<BR>
polymer flaps up and down with ease, adopting almost any configuration
<BR>
without being too strongly affected by the underlying landscape, so
<BR>
does vigorous trading enable wealth to flow easily from one person to
<BR>
another, tending to spread money more evenly.
<BR>
<P>But because the returns on investment are proportional to the amount
<BR>
invested, rich people tend to win or lose larger amounts than
<BR>
poorer. Over time, even if all changes are random, wealth ends up
<BR>
following Pareto's law with an exponent E between 2 and 3. How much
<BR>
money an individual has need have nothing to do with ability. Chop off
<BR>
the heads of the rich, and a new rich will soon take their place.
<BR>
<P>This is not to say that the distribution of wealth cannot be
<BR>
influenced. The model offers what might be the first lesson of
<BR>
economics to be firmly founded in mathematics: that the way to
<BR>
distribute wealth more fairly is to encourage its movement. Taxation,
<BR>
for example, tends to increase E. This is still a Pareto law, but with
<BR>
the wealth distributed somewhat more equitably, the rich own a smaller
<BR>
fraction of the overall pie. With an exponent of 3, for example, the
<BR>
richest 20 per cent would own 55 per cent of the wealth. It's still
<BR>
not fair, but it's better than the US today.
<BR>
<P>The model makes it clear, however, that taxes only work when they are
<BR>
redistributed evenly: if the rich get a disproportionate
<BR>
share--because of lucrative corporate contracts with the government,
<BR>
for example--then the social effect of the tax is wiped out. And
<BR>
according to economist Anthony Atkinson of Oxford University, economic
<BR>
texts have long assumed that there should be some kind of &quot;trade-off&quot;
<BR>
between equality and efficiency: that while spreading the wealth more
<BR>
evenly, higher taxes will also slow economic growth.
<BR>
<P>Fairer and freer trade
<BR>
<P>Yet there may be many ways besides taxes to help wealth move about,
<BR>
for instance by widening the number of people with which any one
<BR>
person tends to trade. In other words, Bouchaud and Mézard's model
<BR>
implies that a more equal society could come from encouraging fairer
<BR>
and freer trade, exchange and competition. Happily for economists,
<BR>
this idea dovetails with their experience and expectations, but the
<BR>
model gives these expectations a robust mathematical foundation.
<BR>
<P>If hot means vigorous trading and low volatility in investments, cold
<BR>
means restricted trading and highly irregular returns. As Bouchaud and
<BR>
Mézard reduce the ease of trade and increase the degree to which
<BR>
investments are random, they find a sudden change in their
<BR>
distribution of wealth: in a cold economy, wealth freezes.
<BR>
<P>Just as the polymer gets trapped into one irregular valley, and so
<BR>
follows a path dictated almost entirely by the random landscape, so
<BR>
wealth finds itself unable to flow easily between people. In this
<BR>
case, the natural diffusion of wealth provided by trading is
<BR>
overwhelmed by the disparities kicked up by random returns on
<BR>
investment.  In Bouchaud and Mézard's model, the economy falls out of
<BR>
the Pareto phase into something much nastier. Now wealth becomes even
<BR>
less fairly distributed, condensing into the pockets of a handful of
<BR>
super-rich &quot;robber barons&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Might this be the case today in some developing or troubled nations?
<BR>
It has been estimated, for example, that the richest 40 people in
<BR>
Mexico have nearly 30 per cent of the money. According to economist
<BR>
Thomas Lux of the University of Kiel in Germany, &quot;most economists
<BR>
would anticipate that wealth concentration will be higher in economies
<BR>
with limited exchange opportunities--such as Russia, for example&quot;.
<BR>
Unfortunately, he adds, &quot;these are usually the economies for which we
<BR>
have poor data or no data at all.&quot; Mézard suspects that such societies
<BR>
may have been more common in the past, but again the economic data are
<BR>
sparse. So testing this prediction of the model won't be easy.
<BR>
<P>Having illuminated Pareto's law of wealth, Bouchaud and Mézard's
<BR>
approach is pointing towards a deeper theoretical perspective on
<BR>
economics. They hope to build more realistic models by moving away
<BR>
from the assumptions of complete randomness, and that every economic
<BR>
agent is identical. Their work offers the promise of understanding not
<BR>
only how the economy behaves now, but also how things might
<BR>
conceivably change.
<BR>
<P>Could political instability throw an economy out of the Pareto regime?
<BR>
Or might wealth condensation be a generic risk if there is too much
<BR>
central planning in an economy? And are there any other hidden
<BR>
variables, changes that might tumble an economy over the precipice and
<BR>
into the depths of inequality? With the global economy becoming more
<BR>
and more tightly knit, these are questions that should concern the
<BR>
whole planet.
