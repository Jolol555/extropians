<P><P><EM>&gt;This halo is called the heiligenschein,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and is due to the brightest light return
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ocurring at the antisolar point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is caused both by the reflection of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the sun's light from the far side of the dew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drops, and by the fact that you are able to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;illuminated grass stems which would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;masked from view from any other direction.

<P><P>Lovely!
<BR>
<P>When I first read your post, I thought it was related to the
<BR>
&quot;gegenschein&quot;, (German for counter-glow) which is a brightening of
<BR>
the night sky in the region of the ecliptic directly opposite the
<BR>
sun's position at the time of observation. It is caused by the
<BR>
reflection of sunlight by small particles that lie in the plane of
<BR>
the solar system. The light-scattering from the particles is in the
<BR>
forward direction.

<BR>
<P>and if you're curious about one aspect of the work of us
<BR>
&quot;dusty astronomers&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Zodiacal Light&quot;
<BR>

<BR>
<P>But it's not related. Heiligenschein is mostly a daytime pheonomena
<BR>
and it usually needs dew.
<BR>
<P>Minnaert, in _The Nature of Light and Color in the Open Air_ (a
<BR>
wonderful 1950s classic text available in a Dover paperback) says:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the early morning, when the sun is still low and casts our long
<BR>
shadow on the dwy grass, we perceive a remarkable aureole of light,
<BR>
uncoloured, lying near and above the shadow of our head. No, it is
<BR>
not an optical illusion, nor a contrast phenomenon, for when the
<BR>
same shadow falls on a gravel path, you no longer see this aureole
<BR>
of light.
<BR>
<P>This phenomenon is at its best when the length of the shadow is at
<BR>
least 15 yards, and when it falls on short grass or clover,
<BR>
greyish-white from the heavy dew. Under such circumstances the
<BR>
Heiligenschein is very pronounced. It is less distinct in the middle
<BR>
of the day after a shower, or at night in the light of strong
<BR>
electric lamps. If there is any doubt about this phenomenon, the
<BR>
best way to be certain is: (i) Survey the whole lawn, and note how
<BR>
the light increases near your shadow. (ii) Take a few steps: you
<BR>
will see the glow of light go with you, and places where the grass
<BR>
was not particularly bright become illuminated as your shadow
<BR>
approaches. (iii) Compare your shadow with that of other people; you
<BR>
will see the Heiligenschein sourrounding only your own head.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Here is another reference about it:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.weather-photography.com/Atmospheric_Optics/heiligenschein.html">http://www.weather-photography.com/Atmospheric_Optics/heiligenschein.html</A>
<BR>
<P>which says:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Heiligenschein is a bright spot of light around the shadow of the
<BR>
observer's head, cast on dewy grass land. The dew droplets on the
<BR>
grass act as lenses, focusing sunlight on the grass leaves, strongly
<BR>
illuminating them, and working again as a lens for the backscattered
<BR>
light. This effect is enhanced by the fact that in the antisolar
<BR>
point (the point opposite the sun, i.e. the shadow of one's head),
<BR>
no other shadows are present, and thus the region looks much
<BR>
brighter because the light and dark details of the surface are
<BR>
integrated by the eye. Look for the Heiligenschein early in the
<BR>
morning, when the sun is low and thus your shadow long, and move
<BR>
yourself to let the shadow be cast on wet dewy grass. The effect is
<BR>
very common, so you should be likely to see it.&quot;
<BR>

<P>These kinds of phenenomena, for me, is about Art, Science and the
<BR>
Beauty of the Universe.

<BR>
<P>Thanks very much for the tip about the Heiligenschein, scecir.
<BR>
<P>Amara
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;That's the whole problem with science. You've got a bunch of
<BR>
empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder.&quot;
