<EM>&gt; I am not a moron. Speaking of morons, it would be interesting if somebody could

<EM>&gt; come up with a more moronic way to communicate than neutrinos, well lets see,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gravity waves would be pretty stupid, but perhaps not quite stupid enough. Come on,

<P>Okay:  Shout REALLY LOUD...

<P>&quot;Most people think Star Trek has solved the problem of faster-than-light
<BR>
travel. I am much more fascinated by Star Trek's solution to the
<BR>
sound-in-a-vacuum problem.&quot;

<P>On a more serious note, are we really sure that neutrinos can't be used for
<BR>
communication?  Suppose you had some way to aim the neutrino beam almost
<BR>
perfectly, correcting for gravitational influences, so that you can pour a
<BR>
beam into a 1mm-diameter cup orbiting another star.  Suppose that you also
<BR>
fire off a million neutrinos in a perfect two-dimensional grid, each neutrino
<BR>
an infinitesimal bit to the side of the previous one, so that at least one
<BR>
neutrino in the pattern is guaranteed to hit any atomic nucleus inside the
<BR>
pattern's radius.  Fire the beam at a crystal where the atomic spacing is less
<BR>
than the pattern diameter, and at least one neutrino is guaranteed to hit. 
<BR>
The result could be an interstellar radio that shines effortlessly through any
<BR>
amount of dust.
<BR>
<P>I have no idea whether this makes any sense from a physicist's perspective,
<BR>
but my guess is &quot;NO&quot;.  The basic assumption seems to be that a really
<BR>
perfectly aimed neutrino can be deliberately made to be absorbed by an atom,
<BR>
and I don't know whether the penetrating quality of neutrinos derives from the
<BR>
improbability of a perfect hit, or the improbability of absorption in any hit
<BR>
(glancing or otherwise).
<BR>
<P>Is a detector made of neutronium more likely to get hit?  Could you reverse
<BR>
the patterned-neutrino theory and use patterned neutronium to guarantee a
<BR>
hit?  Or is that just not the way quantum neutridynamics work?
<BR>
<P>Neutrino-neutronium radio... ought to be a pun here...
<BR>
<P>This makes a nice little dialogue for a post-Singularity novel:
<BR>
<P>&quot;You communicate with Andromeda?  How?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, we send out a sequence of neutrinos; a neutrino strikes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a chlorine atom and turns it into argon, that's a 'one'...&quot;
<BR>
&quot;But can't a neutrino pass through ten light-years of lead
<BR>
without being absorbed?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We aim them really carefully.&quot;
