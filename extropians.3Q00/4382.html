<P>
J.R. and Humans,
<BR>
<P>Why would AI want? That is, Why would AI 'want' anything? Would it simpy
<BR>
have a 'first want' and just keep rolling along? If so, what would it be?
<BR>
<P>Humans didn't evolve on 'want,' those of us who remain, simply survived -
<BR>
not because we were more fit but because we were not 'culled.' Perhaps,
<BR>
simply to 'not die' is our primary 'want.'
<BR>
<P>What is your motivating want? Is survival enough?
<BR>
<P>I just want to understand/connect, but I remain, confused,
<BR>
