<EM> &gt; &gt;If you abandon the concept of *fair* and the rather flaccid view of *well,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;that's just the way things are.....&quot; and instead ask &quot;What are the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;consequences of this state of affairs and how can things be made better?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;you may well improve a situation.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Agreed.  Many people reflexively assume that it is &quot;fair&quot; to allow content
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; providers to monopolize their creations, yet at the same time exploit them
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for perpetual financial gain.  Is it &quot;fair&quot; for me to be able to write a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; song in half an hour, and reap royalty payments from it for the rest of my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; life, while the next guy spends half a year building a house and sells it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for a one time payment, never to see another dime from his investment?
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point.  Suppose a rock band, Aaron and the Analogs, decides not to release
<BR>
<P>a CD, but instead play exclusively live, and stipulate that no one may bring
<BR>
any recording equipment in to the concert.  They check everyone entering for
<BR>
recording equipment.  To the extent they can deter pirating, they are
<BR>
monetarily rewarded for every note they play.  But they must build a following
<BR>
club by club, with no broadcast airplay, if they want to discourage free
<BR>
riders.
<BR>
<P>Another group, Diaz and the Digitals, record a CD at home, and send out their
<BR>
hot single to every radio station they can think of.  Some listeners tape the
<BR>
song and burn their own copies without paying them.  A small percentage of
<BR>
listeners like the song enough to seek out the CD and buy it or tickets to
<BR>
their live shows.  It's marketing.
<BR>
<P>How musicians market their music is their business.  The 'publicness' of a
<BR>
good, which allows free-ridership, is not
<BR>
an inherent characteristic but a function of the manner it is produced,
<BR>
marketed, or even of the relevant unit in which the
<BR>
information is imbedded.
<BR>
<P>Further, costs of exclusion are involved in the production of many goods. For
<BR>
the owner of a movie theater, these exclusion costs include paying for walls,
<BR>
ticket windows, ushers. These serve to exclude or fence out 'freeriders'. Now
<BR>
they could set up projectors and show the movies on screens in the open, and
<BR>
then attempt to prevent casual passerbys from watching. The method of marketing
<BR>
<P>their product is their choice. In the case where their marketing decision
<BR>
results in the publicness of a good, it seems to me to be grossly unjust to ask
<BR>
<P>the government to force all who might potentially see the show without paying
<BR>
to kick in some bucks, whether they DO in fact see the show or not. Or to force
<BR>
<P>passerbys to don glasses that prevent them from viewing the movie. Yet the
<BR>
proponents of property rights in ideas choose such a method when they attempt
<BR>
to get every person purchasing a blank tape to pay a royalty to a third party.
<BR>
Alternatively, as with DAT tape recorders, their proposals sought to ban or
<BR>
cripple entire technologies. This method, done in the name of preventing
<BR>
technologies which are capable of recording publicized (broadcast) music
<BR>
without loss of fidelity, would make mere ownership of tangible property (DAT
<BR>
recorder) a crime. I view proposals for such an implementation of property
<BR>
rights in ideas, which wipe out other areas of property rights altogether, as
<BR>
inconsistent.
<BR>
<P>I don't support the ownership of ideas.  You can imbed your idea in tangible
<BR>
physical objects and try to exercise control over that object with contracts,
<BR>
etc.  If we privatize the enforcement of contracts, let those who want to &quot;own&quot;
<BR>
<P>ideas pay for the enforcement of that contract.  Market forces will probably
<BR>
lead the computer programmer to tie a perceived value to the registration of
<BR>
their program (cheap upgrades, technical support, etc.); rather than paying for
<BR>
<P>a protection agency that tries to police the digital information realm.  But
<BR>
they would be welcome to try to enforce a contract against copying a program
<BR>
that the purchaser would sign when he buys the product.  I just wouldn't
<BR>
subscribe to a protection agency that used some of my
<BR>
subscription fee to police copyright protection.
