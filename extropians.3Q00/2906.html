<EM>&gt; Zero, you and I were among those who were advocating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a more transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; society.  This latest little girl who was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kidnapped Thursday and was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recovered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; yesterday could be the poster child for open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society.  How about it, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; parents?  Would you be in favour of ID implants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for your kids?  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That depends on two things, can you remove the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implant easily (preferably by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself) and does my child want to submit to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process ?

<P>Remember, the unit can allegedly be inactivated by the
<BR>
wearer. Would units for children still have that
<BR>
feature? If you were willing to have this unit placed
<BR>
in your child in the first place, then the age of the
<BR>
child may dictate whether an inactivation feature were
<BR>
made available. Maybe a child-proof inactivation
<BR>
switch of some kind would work.
<BR>
<P>I don't have children, but I would definitely consider
<BR>
one for my infant, especially if there were medical
<BR>
issues.
<BR>
<P>I'll probably consider one for myself primarily
<BR>
because it's a great idea for cryonicists who fear
<BR>
croaking in their sleep and lying there for a couple
<BR>
days before anyone finds out. I want the ALCOR team at
<BR>
my side as soon as possible.
