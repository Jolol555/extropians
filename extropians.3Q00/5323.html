<EM>&gt; &gt; As a human who happens to reside in female form, I am most interested in

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but later mentioned that she had started out male (and presumably is still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; XY in every cell), and hence, I'd have supposed, can have absolutely zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal somatic interest in forced-pregnancy and abortion. Am I missing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something crucial here?
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not right the line at the top of your post.  Misattribution.  I
<BR>
could have with zero contradiction since my hormones, genitals, social
<BR>
gender presence, most mental gender differentiated characteristics and
<BR>
so on are female.  The last have been female from the beginning in major
<BR>
particulars which is precisely why a change was necessary to this
<BR>
phyiscal form.  So why on earth would you assume I have no understanding
<BR>
of female psychology and sensibilities just on the basis of having xy
<BR>
chormosomes?  Do you think the heart or most important part of gender is
<BR>
chromosomal?  I can name 6 or 7 aspects of what is usually termed
<BR>
gender.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note: obviously *every* thinking and feeling adult human will have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest in those topics, whatever form he or she happens to `reside in'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (`instantiate' might be more valid). I'm just querying the `special
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest' rhetoric. This issue will surely recur in a transhuman future, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we start to morph our appearance, and to some extent our inward impulses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and experience (by hormone adjustment, etc), without actually changing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain pivotal self-parameters established or canalized in utero and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; during infancy and, later, by key shaping social experiences.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You are querying up the wrong tee as it were.  On multiple counts.  My
<BR>
&quot;inward impulses&quot; or nature let me to morph the outside drastically.  It
<BR>
was precisely because my &quot;pivotal parameters&quot; were set out of wack in
<BR>
utereo that the changes were necessary.  Primary transsexualism has zero
<BR>
to do with shaping social experiences.
