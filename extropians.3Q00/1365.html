Gibson pulls no punches in this gritty, graphic portrayal of one of the 
<BR>
more unconventional leaders of the US Revolution. He tells it like it is, 
<BR>
or was, much like Speilberg's depiction of WWII in Saving Private Ryan and 
<BR>
Schindler's List. No favors are made to spare the sensitivities of current 
<BR>
day revisionists, propagandists, or, dare I say, outright traitors to the 
<BR>
Constitution.

<P>Mike, after reading your post I felt I had to ask, &quot;are you running for 
<BR>
office?&quot; :)  I think some comparisons can be made about how things were 
<BR>
than as compared to now.  I would like to think a U.S. president and the 
<BR>
three branches of gov't would not be seen by many american people as 
<BR>
tyrannical on the level of King George.
<BR>
<P>I thought Gibson was great in the film.  He does great as the loving, 
<BR>
fierce, introspective hero who lunges at his enemies with limitless 
<BR>
intensity.  But to be honest, I felt the director (of Godzilla and 
<BR>
Independance Day fame) just was not up to it.  I WISH so badly Gibson had 
<BR>
been the director and give it his talented touch.  This film could have 
<BR>
been another &quot;Braveheart&quot; caliber film but was not.
<BR>
<P>Also, have you heard the accusations saying the real British colonal that 
<BR>
the character was based on was not a ruthless murderer but an honorable 
<BR>
officer?  Or that the inspiration for Gibson's character raped his female 
<BR>
slaves?
<BR>
<P>Gibson, and the actor who played the evil British colonal, not to mention 
<BR>
the battle scenes made the film worthwhile to me.  How men could line up in 
<BR>
tight formations and not seek cover as the enemy fired at them at such 
<BR>
close range just floors me...
<BR>
<P>Anyway, it was a good, but sadly not great film in my view.  I wish it had 
<BR>
been Gibson's baby all the way.  &quot;Braveheart&quot; is one of my alltime favorite 
<BR>
films.  &quot;Freedom!!!&quot;
<BR>
<P>My two favorite films of the summer are &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;The Perfect 
<BR>
Storm.&quot;  I hope everyone here gets to see them soon.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John
