<EM>&gt; &gt;       Also, communism is forced cooperation, which I don't believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is good at all.  I believe the more we progress the more volunteer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;charity work is done.  This is true even if we are spending less of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;percentage of our total output on charity and philanthropy, the total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;work is still growing exponential along with everything else.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;must admit that even in free market countries, there is ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;increasing amount of charity work going on.  Such provides a kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;minimum standard to all beings which is ever growing and improving.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Hopefully this safety net will soon cross an important threshold and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be able to guarantee at least survival for all sentient beings.  Heck,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I think even the Amish will be guaranteed their ability to remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;human, live short suffering lives without technology, and so on and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so forth for as long as they choose such, thanks to the supper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;advanced and intelligent beings very small charitable contributions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which will make living lake that much easier than it is today?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;       At the top end, though, let the competition continue, and may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the best be that which is eventually adopted and chosen by all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;rest.  This isn't communism is it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, yes and no.  Ideally communism is a system in which all goods are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equally shared by the people.  That sounds pretty close to the system you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are describing to me.  Keep in mind that the social systems in China and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; former USSR are severely corrupted iterations of communism at best.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Communism doesn’t inherently require an iron curtain through which no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communist citizen can pass, or militaristic, repressive totalitarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regimes.  All you need for “pure” communism is a system by which each member
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produces according to ver ability and consumes according to ver need.  Isn’t
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that what you are describing?
</EM><BR>
<P>I keep hearing this sort of thing from apologizers and fellow travelers. Logic
<BR>
should tell you that when every instance where communist societies were
<BR>
attempted the result was militaristic oppressive totalitarian regiemes, then the
<BR>
'communism' you claim to be 'true' communism is nothing but a chimera, a bait to
<BR>
con people into slavery, and in never actually achievable with human beings
<BR>
outside of very small groups.
