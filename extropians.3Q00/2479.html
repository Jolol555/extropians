<EM>&gt; Nice rhetoric, but its not *quite* the same thing.  The main reason its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illegal to counterfeit money is that the only purpose of counterfeit money 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to use it to dupe people into giving you things and services of value for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something which has no value.  In other words, its raison d'etre is to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facilitate the commission of fraud.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The crime of counterfeiting has *nothing* to do with infringing the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Government's copyright on the design of a dollar.  In fact the Government 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has never enforced its copyright on the design of money (although it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguably has the right to do so).  So long as your reproduction of money has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no reasonable chance of being used to commit fraud (say, painting a larger 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than life size dollar bill on the side of a building) Uncle Sam won't give a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hoot.

<P>Umm, sort of, mostly.
<BR>
<P>The story of J. S. G. Boggs and his dealings with the U. S. Secret
<BR>
Service is so packed with questions about meaning and layers of
<BR>
meaning that I can't possibly decode it here.  But suffice it to say
<BR>
that he is a fine artist who paints U.S. and other currency and,
<BR>
without attempting to defraud anyone, he has had his artworks
<BR>
confiscated by the Secret Service.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/julianmoseley/jsg_boggs.htm">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/julianmoseley/jsg_boggs.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Boggs seeks to &quot;spend&quot; his extremely realistic artwork, which closely
<BR>
resembles actual Federal Reserve Notes, as a further act of
<BR>
performance art.  He explains to store owners that this is not &quot;real&quot;
<BR>
currency, but is real art.  (My favorite response was the store clerk
<BR>
who counter-offered to sell Boggs an extrememly realistic looking
<BR>
sculpture of the box a VCR comes in in exchange for the note when
<BR>
Boggs tried to &quot;buy&quot; a VCR for some of his notes.)
<BR>
<P>No charges have been brought against him for counterfeiting, probably
<BR>
because Boggs has never tried to deceive anyone.  However, the
<BR>
U.S. government gets really uncomfortable about people who get so
<BR>
close to these lines.  They are touchy about people imitating the
<BR>
design elements, even when it seems clear that those people have not
<BR>
tried to commit fraud.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
James
