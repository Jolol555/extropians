<EM>&gt; &gt; From the CTA website at <A HREF="http://www.icta.org">http://www.icta.org</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Executive Director
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Andrew Kimbrell is a public interest attorney, activist and author. He has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  involved in public interest legal activity in numerous areas of technology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  human health and the environment. After working eight years as the Policy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Director at the Foundation for Economic Trends,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Foundation for Economic Trends is, of course, Jeremy Rifkin's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organization.  Looking into the bios of the people at the Turning Point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; website, there are LOTS of connections to Rifkin.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As Mike points out, the great irony here is the extent to which this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well-organized group of people use funding from their &quot;corporate enemies&quot; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get their message across, when the Rifkinite ideology is premised in part on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the notion that &quot;corproations&quot; control the world.  The luddites are becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; masters of playing one single-issue special interest group off another in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pursuit of their much more unified goal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll say it again: The opponents of science and reason are much better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organized, with a much more unified ideological framework than the disparate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; groups working toward a continuation of the goals of the Enlightenment.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real progressives don't get better organized and funded, there's an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing chance of a significant anti-technology and anti-science backlash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that could begin to have real impact on the kinds of timelines we've all come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to accept as more or less &quot;inevitable&quot;.  Folks like Kurzweil and Moravec are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasingly &quot;preaching to the choir&quot;, while others, like Joy and Rifkin, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crafting messages that reach far beyond core anti-progress constituencies.

<EM>&gt;         &quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another

<EM>&gt;        question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;

<P>The day some otherwise disinterested dowager can extend her lifespan threefold by
<BR>
taking a pill, she will.
<BR>
<P>People are right to be skeptical of paradigm-shifting progress.  The nuclear age
<BR>
ushered in an era of mutually assured destruction and fear of who had the bomb.
<BR>
Yet, besides the unfortunate civilian souls at Hiroshima and Nagasaki who died,
<BR>
and others from that incident, none have died from the bomb.
<BR>
<P>The luddites are those that are already making money (off of others), and their
<BR>
puppets, who fear that the paradigm shifts would take away their market.
<BR>
<P>It took humanity millions of years to evolve to where it is, the preeminent
<BR>
species on the planet for thousands of years.  While an asteroid might snuff us
<BR>
all out at once, the probability of our digital descendents doing so is less.
