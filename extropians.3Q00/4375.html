<P>
I don't take Paul's critique to be a call for more government programs.
<BR>
Most of what he (and others in the thread) criticizes IS government.
<BR>
The DMCA is a government law.  The unfair courts are run by government.
<BR>
Unemployment insurance is a government policy.
<BR>
<P>The problem is not business, it's government which is not living up to
<BR>
an idealized image.
<BR>
<P>Although Paul mostly points at big business as being the root cause,
<BR>
obviously this is not the case because states that have eliminated big
<BR>
business have at least as much trouble with corruption and unfairness.
<BR>
<P>It certainly can benefit from criticism, but the Western pluralistic
<BR>
society stacks up very favorably against other systems which have been
<BR>
tried throughout history in terms of providing opportunities and freedom
<BR>
for everyone.
<BR>
<P>Let me add a couple of comments specifically about the DMCA and the
<BR>
current intellectual property disputes.
<BR>
<P>First, although libertarians differ in their views on IP, there is a
<BR>
strong current of opinion which opposes the concept.  A link was provided
<BR>
in this thread earlier to an article on the von Mises web site which
<BR>
made this point.  In a true libertarian society there would probably be
<BR>
few laws about IP due to the difficulty of reaching a consensus.
<BR>
<P>Second, as John Clark pointed out, in the private law model which many
<BR>
extropians see as superior to libertarianism (the application of free
<BR>
markets to the legal system), IP would probably be prohibitively expensive
<BR>
to enforce and so would not be used much at all.
<BR>
<P>Third, even in our current world, DMCA is hardly the final word.
<BR>
The current DeCSS case has only passed through the trial phase.  Higher
<BR>
courts have yet to rule, and a number of constitutional questions have
<BR>
been raised.  Our society has only begun to grapple with these issues.
<BR>
Round one has gone to the copyright holders, but the battle has only
<BR>
begun.  It is far too early to say what the final outcome will be.
<BR>
<P>Fourth, even if DMCA withstands court challenges, there is still
<BR>
legislation to pass.  &quot;Big business&quot; is hardly unanimous on this issue,
<BR>
and theirs is not the only voice which is heard.  A backlash is beginning
<BR>
among business interests, allied with consumer groups.  I pointed to
<BR>
an article last week about businesses supporting Napster.  Here is
<BR>
a similar dispute, regarding rules for home taping of digital video:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2623119,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2623119,00.html</A>.  The cable
<BR>
and video equipment companies are fighting the copyright interests.
<BR>
<P>So in an idealized free-market world, it is unlikely that measures like
<BR>
DMCA would even exist.  And in our complex, pluralistic world, it remains
<BR>
to be seen how intellectual property will be handled as we move forward.
<BR>
