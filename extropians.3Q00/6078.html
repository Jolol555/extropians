<P>
I seem to be reading a different sheet of music from everyone else who's
<BR>
taken part in this discussion.  At the risk of being ridiculed for my
<BR>
divergent thinking, I'd like to ask for comments, or suggestions for
<BR>
reading, or answers to my questions.  
<BR>
<P>For starters, the question &quot;Why would AI want to be friendly?&quot; seems
<BR>
wrong to me.  Instead, I would have asked something more along the lines
<BR>
of, &quot;Why would AI NOT develop according to the same principles as
<BR>
biological life?&quot;  
<BR>
<P>As I said in an earlier post, I agree with Eugene's prediction that to
<BR>
the AI humans would be part of the landscape--no more, no less.  Perhaps
<BR>
I was misunderstanding what he meant by &quot;part of the landscape.&quot;  To me,
<BR>
it meant that humans would be simply another element of nature to the AI,
<BR>
to be used or not used as opportunities come and go.  (I'm defining
<BR>
nature in the following way, from Webster's 9th Collegiate Dictionary--a
<BR>
creative and controlling force in the universe...the external world in
<BR>
its entirety)  Thus, the AI would be neither friendly nor unfriendly
<BR>
towards humans.  
<BR>
<P>Likewise, I think I can safely say that Escherichia coli  is neither
<BR>
friendly nor unfriendly to humans.  It can confer benefits on a human
<BR>
when it lives in his gut and aids digestions of certain foods; or it can
<BR>
make the human sick if  he eats meat contaminated with it.  
<BR>
<P>Eugene has written:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot; Postbiological, as not using self-assembled heavily solvated
<BR>
biopolymers and clusters thereof for self-replication and information
<BR>
processing.
<BR>
<P>There's a reason why artificial life is called artificial. Not
<BR>
biological. Using the same principles, but a different substrate to
<BR>
apply these principles on.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The key phrase to me is &quot;Using the same principles.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>The fact that biological entities exist as nodes in webs of
<BR>
interdependency doesn't seem to be particularly controversial.  If you do
<BR>
a www search on the evolution of cooperation you find numerous books and
<BR>
papers describing attempts to model possible pathways to the cooperation
<BR>
that exists in and among species--but none (at least I didn't find any)
<BR>
questioning the fact that such cooperation exists.  
<BR>
<P>More interesting to me is the concept of sybiosis as a basic principle of
<BR>
evolution.  I have often marveled at the idea that my own body is made up
<BR>
of a number of different species living together, from the bacteria in my
<BR>
gut to the tiny mites on my eyelashes (and the even tinier parasites
<BR>
which live on the mites).  At the cellular level there's further evidence
<BR>
of such team efforts in the DNA of the mitochondria (and the chloroplasts
<BR>
in plant cells).  
<BR>
<P>If symbiosis is a basic principle of evolution (I admit that this idea is
<BR>
somewhat controversial, though it seems to be gaining more general
<BR>
acceptance as time goes by) and if the ability to think is a product of
<BR>
evolution and if the evolution of AI  uses the same principles as
<BR>
biological evolution, then one would not expect the AI to be inclined to
<BR>
kill off all humans or all of any other species.  (It's also true that
<BR>
one would not expect the AI to cater to human whims)  I don't suppose
<BR>
symbiosis would be an appropriate name for a pinciple governing the
<BR>
evolution of a non-biological life form.  Maybe co-evolution?
<BR>
<P>The recent thread on the Asian eel may be relevant to this discussion. 
<BR>
CYMM mentioned that equilibrium could be expected to occur at some point
<BR>
in the not too distant future, and I agreed with this, writing of the
<BR>
imported fire ant in central Texas.  Here's a specific example of a
<BR>
symbiotic type of relationship (although it doesn't fit the strict
<BR>
definition of symbiosis-maybe there's some other word that would be more
<BR>
appropriate here--neither cooperation nor symbiosis seem to be an exact
<BR>
fit).  When the imported fire ant first arrived, the armadillo population
<BR>
plummeted.  Armadillos nest in shallow holes in the ground, and the fire
<BR>
ants were killing the young armadillos before they had a chance to grow
<BR>
the tough skins and outer shell they'd have as adults.  A couple of years
<BR>
ago I began to see armadillos again--I don't know how yet, but somehow
<BR>
some armadillos have managed to raise their young.  Now a significant
<BR>
portion of these armadillo's food seems to consist of the larvae of the
<BR>
imported fire ant--a food that didn't exist prior to its recent
<BR>
introduction to this area.
<BR>
<P>If the evolution of AI follows the same principles as biological
<BR>
evolution, then I would expect AI to become, for humans,  part of the
<BR>
landscape--that is to say, part of nature in general.  Another set of
<BR>
forces to contend with, some beneficial some detrimental.  I would expect
<BR>
the human species to evolve in response to the presence of the AI (both
<BR>
socially and biologically) but not to be killed off.  What this means is
<BR>
that SOME humans would die.  The transition could be very uncomfortable
<BR>
for the survivors.  But as with all crises, there would exist opportunity
<BR>
as well as tragedy.
