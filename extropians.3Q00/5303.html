<EM>&gt; Henry P. Stapp is trying to explain non-locality by means of his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantum-mind-brain model.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;Orthodox Copenhagen quantum theory renounces the quest to understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rules that describe connections between our observations. However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an examination of certain nonlocal features of quantum theory suggests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the perceived need for this renunciation was due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uncritical importation from classical physics of a crippling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metaphysical prejudice, and that rejection of that prejudice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opens the way to a dynamical theory of the interaction between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind and brain that has significant explanatory power.&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds generally interesting, however, I find I have a skeptical
<BR>
reaction to the idea of  &quot;dynamical interaction between mind and brain&quot;
<BR>
as explaining anything more than many of the standard ideas relating to
<BR>
quantum theory. For instance, the Copenhagen assumption of state-vector
<BR>
collapse already depends on the assumption of a special, dynamic,
<BR>
interaction between measuring devices and the quantum world! Also, if we
<BR>
wish to question whether the collapse happens at all, isn't the Many
<BR>
Worlds idea, supported by Deutsch and others, very much the standard
<BR>
here? Sometimes Many Worlds can even be *hinted* at in discussions where
<BR>
it isn't actually mentioned explicitly, as in the following quotation
<BR>
from a very recent message on the sci.physics.research newsgroup (John
<BR>
Baez was the writer of the message that I'm quoting from):
<BR>
<P>&quot;When the position of an object affects the stuff in its environment, 
<BR>
putting the object in a superposition of position states will soon 
<BR>
cause its environment to be in a superposition of states as well.  
<BR>
If the environment includes *us*, we will wind up in a superposition 
<BR>
of states where we see the object in various definite positions.  This 
<BR>
means we'll see the object in some (random) position, rather than seeing 
<BR>
the interference effects normally associated with superpositions of
<BR>
position states.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Now this sort of statement surely represents some kind of metaphysically
<BR>
wild scenario! If I wind up existing in a &quot;superposition of states&quot;,
<BR>
this is just the same as saying that there are many different copies of
<BR>
me, existing in separate parallel worlds, the worlds having branched off
<BR>
from one another at some point in the flow of time. So I'll never be
<BR>
aware of this general, &quot;environmental&quot; superposition, and *that's* what
<BR>
effectively pins the observed object to one location, the object's
<BR>
timeline having split in tandem with my own, you see.
<BR>
<P>To the extent that Many Worlds explains what superpositions are all
<BR>
about, better than more ordinary, Copenhagen style explanations, I
<BR>
suppose we have to consider the possibility that *all* possible world
<BR>
histories are equally real? Does this make any difference to our
<BR>
scientific outlook on the world, or do we just discount Many Worlds as
<BR>
one more grand uncertainty, as in &quot;gee, don't know if all those
<BR>
alternate histories are real, or not?&quot; Even just as a matter of
<BR>
explaining to someone what is implied or suggested by basic science
<BR>
these days, this has some importance, right? For the moment I'm saying
<BR>
that the agnostic position, &quot;don't know if alternate worlds exist or
<BR>
they don't&quot; is the best I can do. Will there ever be a way to do better?
