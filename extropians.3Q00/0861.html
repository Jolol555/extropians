<EM>&gt; I'm afraid you'll have to spell it out for me, I'm suffering from a pathetic

<EM>&gt; lack of imagination. If my entire audience has the idea that they need never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and should never) pay to listen, and reality maps onto this by way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pirated material which is incredibly easy to access (easier than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paid-for stuff), then how do I get paid?

<P>The Grateful Dead pioneered one business model. They freely allowed people who
<BR>
wished to record concerts to do so, and there is a large market for the products
<BR>
of 'tapers', who frequently reproduce these tapes and sell them. A few of the
<BR>
best tapers are freinds with and were endorsed by the Dead. Dick's Picks is one
<BR>
brand of taper 'bootleg' Dead recordings. It did not matter that you could buy a
<BR>
recording with all your favorite Dead tunes taped at the January 1990 Berkeley
<BR>
concerts, you most likely also own the CDs of the official studio tracks as
<BR>
well. Each concert features the same songs performed very differently, with
<BR>
original free form performances. The Dead are not broke by any means of the
<BR>
imagination.
<BR>
<P>The advantage of this model is that with this freedom to tape, would-be pirates
<BR>
had no market, and loyal tapers were content to leave the band's own studio
<BR>
tapes and CDs be without any significant pirating.
<BR>
<P>All that Metallica's snitty little performance is going to do is increase the
<BR>
level of piracy of its recordings. Most fans don't give a shit if Lars wants
<BR>
another Lamborghini for his collection. The free market is a two way
<BR>
transaction.
<BR>
<P>While I don't condone piracy, and I do support intellectual property, one must
<BR>
acknowledge that the level to which one's work is pirated is a good indication
<BR>
that either one's work is overpriced for the market, or one is restricting the
<BR>
supply of one's art to the market. If you don't want your work pirated, adjust
<BR>
one of these parameters.
