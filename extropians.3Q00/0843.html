<EM>&gt;The problem is that most of us are not well educated in economics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophy and sociology, and that it often doesn't seem they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessary. After all, the system largely works, doesn't it? We miss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the obvious stuff just because it is right under our noses, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concentrate on the rest. But transhumanism is very much about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;questioning the way things have always been, *all* of the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;condition - including how we relate to the current philosophical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political, social and economical systems. If we don't question things,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to come up with new solutions and then test them to see if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are better than the current ones we will be dependent on the solutions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other groups produce, solutions which may not just be bad but also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;based on fundamentally incompatible values.

<P>I of course encourage people to learn more about social/human sciences,
<BR>
but I don't really like this apparent &quot;dream of autarky&quot; you try to
<BR>
motivate it with (<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html</A>).
<BR>
<P>We live in an interdependent world, and this is a wonderful thing.
<BR>
It is why we are rich.  There is a *division of labor*, whereby we
<BR>
each specialize in improving some aspect of living, and then we can
<BR>
all share all of the improvements.  It is madness for some small group
<BR>
to insist on developing all their important systems by themselves,
<BR>
for fear of being corrupted by the values of other groups.
<BR>
<P>If you want to live in a rich hi-tech world, you WILL &quot;be dependent
<BR>
on the solutions other groups produce&quot;.  Otherwise you're the Amish.
<BR>
<P>You do get to choose your expertize and focus.  There is really almost
<BR>
no one using social science expertize to think seriously about how
<BR>
future technologies will influence social systems, and what new
<BR>
possibilities they open up.  I encourage anyone capable to join me in
<BR>
this enterprise.
<BR>
<P>But time spent doing this can't be spent improving cryonics, developing
<BR>
AI, designing launch systems, or sketching Jupiter brains.  You have
<BR>
to *choose* what you influence, and then you have to accept what the
<BR>
rest of the world does on all the other topics.
