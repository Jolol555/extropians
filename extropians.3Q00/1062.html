<P><EM>&gt; I think it likely that we will have the ability to create a single

<EM>&gt; expensive &quot;upload&quot; (for less than $1B) well before advanced nanotech,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and given the vast amounts of money to be made from one this is what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm, I see several questions/problems:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) who &quot;owns&quot; the hardware the upload runs on?;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) does the upload have the &quot;classically&quot; attributed human
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights or is it a simple slave mind?
<BR>
<P>Unless you can take the consciousness out of the machine there
<BR>
are going to be a lot of people arguing you can't use it as
<BR>
a slave.  If it is a free agent, then a lot of legal groundwork
<BR>
will need to be laid for it to act as an economic agent (have
<BR>
a S.S. number, pay taxes, etc.).  Then if it doesn't own its
<BR>
hardware it could end up paying hefty lease fees to IBM or whomever
<BR>
does own it.  Looks like a swamp to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then its a matter of filling market niches and business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competition that I think leads to domination of the upload economy by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the first few thousand, and perhaps the first few ten, uploads.
</EM><BR>
<P>If this strategy is followed before nanotech, then you still have
<BR>
the problems that the hardware is going to fill a room and will
<BR>
produce a very hefty annual electricity bill.  You are likely to
<BR>
have 10-15 years before the hardware gets cheap enough that the cost
<BR>
of running an upload falls below the annual food budget of a real
<BR>
person.  It may be an interesting research tool but I doubt it
<BR>
will quickly break out in a way that changes the general economy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By the time your &quot;evoloads&quot; show up, the game is basically over.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends.  There is likely to be a lot of human prejudice against
<BR>
uploads.  I could see trade wars and sactions developing between
<BR>
the nations that allow or use them and those that don't.
<BR>
<P>Even if that doesn't happen a general awareness of the economic
<BR>
threat uploads represent could drive a Manhatten project for
<BR>
evoloads.  If AI keeps getting more and more sophisticated
<BR>
(becoming non-AI in the process), then the economic advantages
<BR>
of the uploads may have been trumped by mass-produced hardware/
<BR>
software agents.
<BR>
<P>If you assume the upload is a full copy of a human you have
<BR>
an interesting problem initially of the upload having capacities
<BR>
and capabilities for an economy that doesn't exist yet.  It also
<BR>
has the standard pattern for human needs and desires.  It might
<BR>
get paid megabucks to write some fancy software and then spend
<BR>
it all for a loopback interface that makes it feel like it is
<BR>
getting a nice massage.
