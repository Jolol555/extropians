<P>
Samantha Atkins sniffs,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Uh, excuse me, but that attitude is just as bad as that of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eschatologically minded fundie.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, it's just as &quot;bad&quot; because you define &quot;bad&quot; according to the belief system
<BR>
installed in you by the establishment and your own biology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Those &quot;fundies and fanatics&quot; think a lot like you.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd ask you for details of your method of insuring world peace and friendly AI,
<BR>
but apparently that method hasn't worked very well, from what I've heard of
<BR>
current global events. If there's something worse than lunatic fundies it's
<BR>
probably people who can't see the difference between reason and religiosity.
<BR>
Your self-righteous attitude is not appropriate. Thanks anyway.
<BR>
<P>The question for me has now changed from  why AI would want to be friendly, to
<BR>
*who* it would be friendly toward. As far as I'm concerned, the friendliest
<BR>
thing AI could do would be to let homicidal fanatics do their damnedest, thereby
<BR>
ridding the world of contentious characters. Justify your moralism or Sayonara
<BR>
Samantha.

<P>Why wouldn't friendly AI leave fundies in the dust?

sees Heaven and someone who drinks too much and sees snakes.&quot;
