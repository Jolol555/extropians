<P>
<EM>&gt; Before you can produce it at all, you'll need to be able to produce a spec.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's the really tough part.

<P>Okay, we'd better get started then.
<BR>
<P>The need to define sanity indicates a desire to prove ourselves sane.
<BR>
<P>But the whole history of humanity proves that humanity lacks sanity as much
<BR>
as it lacks anything. Basically, humanity proves itself insane by fighting
<BR>
five thousand wars in the last three thousand years. The greed, jealousy,
<BR>
and selfishness that prevails throughout human social orders indicates the
<BR>
dominance of something other than sanity.
<BR>
<P>Sane people exult in doing what comes naturally, in satisfying a congenital
<BR>
appetite for the beauty of reason, the thrill of understanding, the
<BR>
excitement of knowing reality directly.
<BR>
<P>A wise man once defined sanity as &quot;coming out of the mind into the open,
<BR>
into the silence, where no thought, no desire disturbs you. In that pool of
<BR>
silence, with not a single ripple upon it, sanity abides.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Sanity means to secure your happiness, and by extension, the happiness of
<BR>
your neighbors, family, friends, and community, since one cannot really feel
<BR>
happy when surrounded by misery.
<BR>
<P>When your means fulfill your ends, if you can manage that -- the harmony
<BR>
between the means and the end -- then you've got sanity. When your means
<BR>
don't satisfy your end, and you continue to repeat the same means, never
<BR>
arriving at a gratifying end, then you've got a neurosis. &quot;Make every act of
<BR>
your life dedicated to love and sanity arises out of it,&quot; a romantic man has
<BR>
said.
<BR>
<P>When liberated people want to play the game of sanity, they live as sanely
<BR>
as anyone can live. Then they can outdo Aristotle with logic and reason.
<BR>
They can follow every rule and regulation. But if they want to play the
<BR>
lunatic game, then they can become as demagogic, theologic, and ideologic as
<BR>
any other maniac.
<BR>
<P><P>The perfectly sane brain thinks only when necessary. It reverts to ecstatic
<BR>
tranquility (i.e., it allows  thought-noise to dissipate, clearing the way
<BR>
for the emergence of superlative sentience or learning) whenever it can, for
<BR>
as long as it can. Conversely, the insane brain cannot stop chattering.
<BR>
<P>A psychologist asked a psychonomer, &quot;How do you deal with neurotics?&quot;
<BR>
<P>The psychonomer replied, &quot;We trap them?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Oh? And how do you do that?&quot; asked the psychologist.
<BR>
<P>&quot;By making it impossible for them to ask any more questions,&quot; answered the
<BR>
psychonomer.
<BR>
<P>Keep smiling,
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Something beckons within the reach of each of us 
<BR>
to save heroic genius. Find it, and do it.
<BR>
For as goes heroic genius, so goes humankind.&quot;
<BR>
