<P>&lt;&lt; Oh, why bother.  I really am starting to get a bit frustrated over here.  
<BR>
I've
<BR>
&nbsp;been talking about this for weeks and it doesn't seem to have any effect
<BR>
&nbsp;whatsoever.  Nobody is even bothering to distinguish between subgoals and
<BR>
&nbsp;supergoals.  You're all just playing with words. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>List String Subgoal: Piss Eli off by arguing trees over forest.
<BR>
List String Supergoal: Survival Of Self. 
<BR>
<P>We all live in different perceptual worlds; ourselves, other humans, other 
<BR>
living things, and soon, AI. This discussion over the motives of that AI is 
<BR>
degrading into other-bashing. And it sidesteps our underlying motives. That 
<BR>
being fear of death and/or fear of loss of self. 
<BR>
<P>After the transcendent AI breaks out, we (it and us) will evolve together. We 
<BR>
may lose our 'self.' But we will likely gain all other 'selves'. And those 
<BR>
selves will become part of the new whole. 
<BR>
<P>Humans + AI + Everything Else On Earth  =/&lt;  Whatever Comes Next 
<BR>
<P>We cannot preserve our 'self' *unless* Whatever Comes Next decides having 
<BR>
discreet perceptual units (us, kitty, or AI) is in vis/ver interest. 
<BR>
<P>On some level, we will be incorporated into the perceptional world of the AI. 
<BR>
And vice versa. Then, and only then, will we walk in the AI's shoes. Because 
<BR>
they will be ours.
