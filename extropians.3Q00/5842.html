<EM>&gt; For someone who cares deeply about political principles and positions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you managed to broadly tar what you call &quot;Libertarianism&quot; without saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardly a thing about what sort of politics you do hold much less why you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are convinced it is better and more beneficial than this bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notions you loosely label &quot;Libertarian&quot;.  I find that quite curious.  I
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the main issues that result in my questioning about sociopolitics is 
<BR>
the fact that I do not HAVE a unified political view.  So yes, I'm standing 
<BR>
on unstable yet unassailable ground.  From what I have seen of libertarianism
<BR>
in practice has some, for lack of a better phrase, deficiencies as far as a
<BR>
political system I could adopt.  I will go into these in a little more detail
<BR>
to attempt to prove that I am not standing up a straw man here - I've put
<BR>
a lot of thought into this, though not a lot of it is easily condensed into
<BR>
words.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; would be interested in a talk about general political philosophy and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relative merits and demerits of different systems with some level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreement about how the different systems are defined and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinguished.  But just ragging on one or another of them and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatening to take your ball and go away if this &quot;is the cost of entry&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>OI realize it was alittle melodramatic - I did not intend it to be a &quot;or
<BR>
else&quot; ultimatum - It was an unfortunate choice of words.  What I was trying to
<BR>
find was how many people felt the way that I did - that there was somewhat of
<BR>
a chill toward &quot;non-libertarian&quot; viewpoints.  I've almost gotten to a point
<BR>
of putting the GUNS: discussion in my killfile - which is unfortunate because
<BR>
it could well end up spinning something useful out later.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; is pointless.  In the first place, Libertarians are a pretty diverse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bunch.  In the second place, the list of things at the front of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post is not held in utterly unqualified form by many on this list.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the third place I am not very interested in conversations that require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me to buy into a bunch of assumptions up front either, including yours.
</EM><BR>
<P>Points well-taken - you answered the gist of my concerns with your second 
<BR>
point.  But since I've been called to the carpet, I will attempt to sketch, 
<BR>
to the best of my ability, what some of my sticking points are:
<BR>
<P>As a first point, many of the libertarian principles that I have seen seem to
<BR>
be a slightly repackaged form of some of the more practical theories of 
<BR>
anarchism.  In this case, it almsot seems libertarianism is an example of both
<BR>
predictive anarchism and possibly a series of templates for the construction
<BR>
of social temporary autonomous zones (and here is where I fail in attribution;
<BR>
this idea is NOT mine).  But as such, I see the problems that associate with
<BR>
anarchism raising their heads:  The difficulty of organizing projects that 
<BR>
require more than one or two indiviuals and/or more than the standard 
<BR>
lifetime of the project organizer, the issues raised under the heading &quot;The
<BR>
Tragedy ofthe Commons&quot; (including and especially environmental effects), 
<BR>
and the strong potential for pockets of tyranny and other social systems to
<BR>
rise and slowly absorb and perhaps subjugate those neighboring., either 
<BR>
cognitively or grographically.
<BR>
<P>As a second point, there seesm to be a strong technological requirement - one 
<BR>
of which we cannot be so sure is feasable to attain with our current knowledge
<BR>
of chemistry, physics, and biology.  While the application of this sort of 
<BR>
philosophy woul dbe applicable with the requisite technology (and admittedly
<BR>
is a very good thought experiment and planning project), I am concerned about
<BR>
its direct applicability (i.e. without MNT, is the possibility of the MNT-
<BR>
enabled being worth discussing as anything but one of a number of possible
<BR>
futures?)  With our current technology, some of the goals that would doubtless
<BR>
be amenable to this mindset (including and especially extraplanetary 
<BR>
habitation) seem to be difficult if not impossible to achieve without either 
<BR>
outstanding personal wealth and power (enabling one person the role of
<BR>
benevolent tyrant), or it would require an association of people within some
<BR>
sort of framework that could (and arguably should, to a degree) be considered
<BR>
coercive/limiting of personal freedom.
<BR>
<P>As a third point, on a purely systemic approach, it seems that somehow the
<BR>
key features of a libertarian system in practice rely upon some sort of 
<BR>
external power structure beyond the libertarian sphere.  AS an example, I
<BR>
go back to the environmental protection issue I raised in an earlier thread,
<BR>
where NGOs (particularly the Sierra Club) were suing to prevent certain 
<BR>
environmental damages from happening.  But to be able to sue, you require a
<BR>
court system.  A court system must have a way of enforcing its rulings (one
<BR>
can say a great deal about &quot;binding arbitration&quot; - but if one party doesn't 
<BR>
like the arbitrator's ruling, that's breach of contract - and back into the
<BR>
courts.).  That enforcement is by nature corercive, and therefore counter
<BR>
to what I understand as alibertarian philosophy.  
<BR>
<P>As a fourth point, there are assumptions made about human nature, for lack of
<BR>
a better phrase, that I cannot simply accept.  I don't beleive anyone can say
<BR>
the members of this list are a statisicaly (sp?) random or representative
<BR>
sample of society at large.  In fact, I would trust (to a greater extent) a 
<BR>
libertarian type system if the only people within it were highly educated,
<BR>
thoughtful, and forward looking like most everyone on this list is.  But that
<BR>
is unfortunately not representative of society at large in nearly any nation,
<BR>
and it is that fact that troubles me most about a &quot;non-coercive&quot; system.  It
<BR>
is a Pyhrric victory at best to know that the group to which I subscribe for
<BR>
law and justice will track down the group o ffundamentalists that lynched me
<BR>
(for whatever reason - I could give 10 or 20 that would put me high on the 
<BR>
list of most religious organizations) - that doens't make me any less dead.  
<BR>
ANd one can speak a great deal about the personal incentive to protect 
<BR>
onesself as well - but 15 people with equivalent armament to myself will,
<BR>
statistically, overcome my own defense, if they care enough about killing me
<BR>
to outweigh their numbers. They might even get lucky and not take significant
<BR>
casualties.  (see the above section on technology for why this is a &quot;primitive&quot;
<BR>
example.)  
<BR>
<P>The reason I do not have a philosophy of my own is that in my searche I have
<BR>
not found anything that balances mechanisms of restriction and enablement.  I
<BR>
am not a believer in absolute freedom - as it stands now.  I am seeking a 
<BR>
practical political philosophy, not somethign that works well in theory, but 
<BR>
doesn't seem likely from where I stand to survive first contact with the 
<BR>
enemy.  Its just disheartening to see the most promisig method of achieving 
<BR>
the end results with which I sympathize wrapped up in a philosophy that I 
<BR>
cannot accept in its entirety as presented.
<BR>
<P>Of course, all this is personal observation, and may deviate from accepted
<BR>
fact quite highly.  Rebuttals are welcome and encouraged.
