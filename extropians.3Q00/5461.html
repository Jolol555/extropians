AN ALERT
<BR>
<P>We have received notice of an effort to persuade President Clinton to use
<BR>
his power to grant clemency to and commute sentences of low level,
<BR>
non-violent drug offenders.  the appeal is being made in keeping with the
<BR>
Jubilee year of 2000.  Since the effort is in keeping with our goals and
<BR>
purposes, we wanted you to have the opportunity to join this endeavor.  A
<BR>
letter to be sent to President Clinton is attached.   If you are interested
<BR>
in join in or signing on to the campaign, please  email:

<BR>
Honorable William J. Clinton
<BR>
President of the United States
<BR>
The White House
<BR>
1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
<BR>
Washington,  DC  20500
<BR>
<P>Dear Mr. President:
<BR>
<P>As faith leaders who cherish Divine justice and mercy for all persons, we
<BR>
ask you to grant clemency to and to release on supervised parole those
<BR>
Federal prisoners who have served at least five years for low-level,
<BR>
nonviolent involvement in drug cases (as defined by the US Department of
<BR>
Justice).  Mr. President, scores of Americans are serving unconscionably
<BR>
long sentences for drug offenses --in some cases twenty years or more
<BR>
--which are grossly out of proportion to the nature and severity of their
<BR>
crimes.  These unduly severe sentences violate human rights and waste
<BR>
scarce criminal justice resources.  The continued incarceration of such
<BR>
offenders does not serve any meaningful purpose.
<BR>
<P>The constitutional power to grant reprieves and pardons is a unique and
<BR>
powerful tool to express the public's merciful spirit.  As you know, the
<BR>
public has a strong desire for justice and for forgiveness.  By exercising
<BR>
your executive power to forgive these men and women you help heal the
<BR>
devastating effects of race and class disparities in our criminal justice
<BR>
system.  Commuting the sentences of low-level, non-violent drug offenders
<BR>
will begin to restore much-needed public confidence in our criminal justice
<BR>
system.
<BR>
<P>Many of these offenders are parents.  Their children are being hurt by
<BR>
these separations.  Their children and their communities need them home.
<BR>
Clemency is the last hope for justice for many of these offenders, as many
<BR>
have exhausted all appeal options available to them.  Mr. President, only
<BR>
you have the power to return these men and women to their families, and to
<BR>
let them become peaceful, productive citizens.  We hope, trust and pray
<BR>
that you will.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely.....
<BR>
