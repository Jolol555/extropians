<P>Do you see that your view is a subjective one that cannot be the basis
<BR>
for rational law limiting the choices of others?  Do you think
<BR>
controlling your own destiny is merely a matter of &quot;convenience&quot;?  Or
<BR>
that deciding to be a parent is a matter of biological accident rather
<BR>
than intention and devotion to the task that by its nature should not be
<BR>
forced?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  I consider this a terrible tragedy.  Also tragic though is how often the &gt; mother/parents who do have the child face poverty and lack of societal resources to help them.  And some of these children might be born to mothers who are unfit in one way or another to raise them.  And then there is the issue of absentee fathers such as the one I had...  But then so many childless couples so desperately wish to adopt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is without doubt a complex issue with many sides.  I still view the fetus in the womb as a human being in miniature whether they are a few days old or nine months.  And I believe they have the right to live and the opportunities that come with it even when life starts out hard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you believe that the supposed rights of the foetus overrule the
<BR>
rights of the woman carrying it?  This is the bizarre implication that I
<BR>
cannot easily consider as being rational.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I look forward to the day when humanity is not faced with this issue.  And that time is not too far off from now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>With that I certainly agree.
