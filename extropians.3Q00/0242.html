<P>Ja, I still ha' me doots something like that would work, given that
<BR>
current designs for the plutonium detonator have a neutron
<BR>
source to assist criticality.  Id have to sit down and do out the
<BR>
calcs, some of which would require educated guesses.  Its telling
<BR>
that the US dismantled its antimissile system from the 70s.  Thats
<BR>
pretty good evidence that a nuclear anti-nuke isnt the right way.
