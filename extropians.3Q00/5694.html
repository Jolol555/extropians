<BR>
<EM>&gt;I've belatedly had a chance to read Robin's futarchy paper,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf</A> or .ps.  ... a fascinating idea, ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I had a few concerns which may not have been clearly addressed.  The first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is, what evidence is there that futures market predictions can work over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the time scale envisioned for futarchy?  The paper talks about 50 year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time horizons.  But most futures markets only predict prices a few months
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out.  Even the long-term LEAPS options are only good for a year or two.
</EM><BR>
<P>Stock markets implicitly forecast out to infinity.  That is, they estimate
<BR>
a weighted average of future profits, weighted by risk-rated interest rates.
<BR>
They arguably do worse estimating long-term outcomes than short come ones,
<BR>
but presumably any system of estimation would share that feature.  My claim
<BR>
is not that speculative markets do very well at everything, just that they
<BR>
on average do better than the other institutions we know of.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Along these lines, can any conceivable system estimate GDP over such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long time frame?  Robin's specific proposal is to average log of GDP over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the next few decades, discounting by a few percent a year.  What if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combine this with Robin's estimates from his paper on long-term growth,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...  We could see the economy doubling over periods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of weeks, and later even hours.  I think with Robin's formula you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get a divergent series; at a minimum, the sum would be dominated by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ultra-explosive growth we hit during the Singularity.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you take the log of an exponential, you get a line.  And then if you
<BR>
exponentially discount that line, you get a finite result.  So any finite
<BR>
set of speedups in the exponential growth rate of the economy gives a
<BR>
convergent, not divergent, result for the value of my first cut
<BR>
proposed measure of national welfare.
<BR>
<P>It is quite true, however, that to the extent one takes the possibility
<BR>
of such transitions seriously, and takes seriously the idea that policy
<BR>
decisions might influence when such a transition would occur, that my
<BR>
proposal would give an immense weight to preferring policies which are
<BR>
likely to make such transitions happen earlier.  It would be very hard
<BR>
for other considerations to be heard over this.
<BR>
<P>But I think this is as it should be.  The benefits of citizens being
<BR>
ridiculously rich just a year sooner are so enormous that it should
<BR>
get a very large weight.  Of course it wouldn't be worth, say, losing
<BR>
half the population to a sudden death, but my proposed measure gets
<BR>
that right too I think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I was somewhat confused by the futarchy descriptions of the legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;structure as being composed of nested policies, with more fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;policies authorizing less fundamental ones.  This does describe the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current regime to some extent, but how would it work with futarchy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Would more-fundamental policies constrain less-fundamental ones?  How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would this be enforced, by the courts?
</EM><BR>
<P>Any proposal for a fundamental &quot;rule of government&quot; requires that one
<BR>
assume some structure which enforces that rule.  Technically, there
<BR>
needs to be some way to complain that the rule has been violated, and
<BR>
some process that responds to such complaints.  Ideally you just
<BR>
complain to the citizens via free speech, who become so outraged that
<BR>
they revolt or throw the bastards out.  Some sort of court system
<BR>
can often effectively economize on citizen attention.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The other point that seemed troublesome to me was the tremendous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complexity of current laws. ... Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... 4570 lines long.  ...  I don't see how such a complex document
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could successfully make it through a futarchy process.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Currently a process exists in which various competing interests
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;influence legislatures to try to get language way they want it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;At the other extreme you could let anyone propose any law, but there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be so many possible variations on even a simple 5 or 10 page
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;law that it's hard to see how the market could work.  Every different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clause or section could be reworded, added or removed.  You'd have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combinatorial explosion of possible documents.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are costs to getting speculators to pay attention to any give
<BR>
proposal, and the ideal would be to have those costs borne by the
<BR>
person or group that makes a proposal.  So if there is a status
<BR>
quo copyright act, and you want to add two words to line 3289, you
<BR>
have to pay a &quot;bank&quot; to create the relevant assets and a &quot;market&quot;
<BR>
to publish offers to trade them, and you have to get someone to
<BR>
continue to put up significant offers to trade which imply that this
<BR>
proposal would clearly improve expected national welfare.  You might
<BR>
also have to pay a &quot;proposal fee&quot; to the government, which is
<BR>
intended to account for the costs imposed on others which must
<BR>
track
<BR>
<P>If your proposal says that it only applies to the status quo as of
<BR>
Sept 15, and your proposal says it will be decided over the week
<BR>
from Sept 15 to Sept 22, then if the status quo is changed on Sept 17,
<BR>
your proposal is invalid and can't be considered.  If the chances of
<BR>
a proposal being approved are too low, its proponents won't bother
<BR>
to pay the cost to propose it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Robin's document is somewhat sparse in its description of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;procedural issues.  He suggests using the futarchy market itself to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evaluate different ways of handling these matters.  This is a consistent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;viewpoint but it makes it harder to evaluate the system because we can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know in advance how the specifics would work.  I'd like to see futarchy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;details fleshed out a little more as a straw man proposal.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose I could think more about giving a specific example of this:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;There are some conservative rules regarding what is a valid market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when such a market clearly estimates something, and how long the veto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delay is.  These rules say who can propose policies, who can bet on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them, what assets and market places count for determining prices, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how long and distinctly prices must differ in order to say that one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;price is ``clearly&quot; above another.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, the feedback I get from economist friends is that I've
<BR>
already gone too far in the engineering direction to be publishable
<BR>
in a good economics journal.  Going farther in that direction causes
<BR>
even more troubles.
<BR>
<P>Thanks again for your thoughtful comments!
