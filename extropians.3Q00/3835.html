<P>If your dreams are comprised of creative ideas or circumstances I don't
<BR>
know why they would be dismissed.  If your dreams are religious and
<BR>
desirous of some of the teachings of religious beliefs, there are probably
<BR>
better formats to discuss them.  However, dreams are the fruits of thought
<BR>
and it's probably not a good idea to give our minds hard and fast rules on
<BR>
what to dream about -:)   I enjoy draming about the Creativity Augmentum
<BR>
when anything considered &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; will be in demand and aesthetic
<BR>
contributions to the future considered to be the alpha-of-thinking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The reason that I never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;joined ExI years ago still stands and that is the dogmatic embrace of atheism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and the ridicule of any sense of spirituality in others by its members.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think your statement is broad and sweeping.  Approximately one year ago
<BR>
that I started a thread on this list titled something to the effect of &quot;Is
<BR>
There A Need for Transhuman Spirituality.&quot;  In this post I discussed at
<BR>
length why I considered to be a need for refined emotions and how we can
<BR>
develop and apply our current consciousness to the logical outgrowths of
<BR>
the current and future trends of superintelligence.
<BR>
<P>Spirituality does not pertain exclusively to the concept of a human soul or
<BR>
supernatural.  It can and does pertain to a sense of life.  One's spirit is
<BR>
the vital animating force of one's being and associated with one's mind.
<BR>
Kindness is often associated with being spiritual, while not necessarily
<BR>
mystical or religious.  
<BR>
<P>I do not have an affinity for a human soul.  I do not have a mystical
<BR>
sensibility.  I do have a sense of my own being and consciousness and a
<BR>
desire to find peace of mind within my own mind and in all aspects of my
<BR>
life around me.  Thus, I think you are inaccurate in claiming that a
<BR>
member, such as myself, as adverse to spirituality, unless you are
<BR>
exclusively referring to narrow, dogmatic concepts.
<BR>
<P>Further, I do not deny the existence of any of the many Gods that are
<BR>
purported to exist simultaneously.  I do not believe in any one God nor do
<BR>
I have an affinity to the sanctimonious followings of many religious
<BR>
ceremonies, but certainly respect diversity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Dogma, in anyone, is silly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay,
<BR>
