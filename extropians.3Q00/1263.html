<EM>&gt; &gt; If I was in a position to be cryonically suspended (which I don't think
</EM><BR>
I am
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in Oz), I think I would make it very, very clear that I *volunteer* for
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; first uploading experiments. All the better if the general public thinks
</EM><BR>
I'm
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dead, it is likely to be very difficult to organise if you fit the more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; commonly accepted definition of being alive. I would hope that someone
</EM><BR>
alive
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; at the time of the experiments actually gave a damn about me, and where
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; eventually ended up, but if not, well, I'd still rather be on the front
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; line. Exploit me, I don't care; becoming one of the first few Posthumans
</EM><BR>
has
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; got to come with a price tag. And ye gods, the payoff...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But can this be considered *informed* consent?  You don't know anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the procedure, you don't know what the risks are.  Would you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volunteer if there was a 99%+ chance that your brain would simply be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroyed and we'd get some partial information out of it, that might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guide future uploads?  Would you volunteer if there was a large chance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a successful upload would be inordinately unpleasant, full of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensory deprivation, madness and pain?
</EM><BR>
<P>If I get buried/cremated, that's a 100% chance. And unlike many on the list,
<BR>
I don't see cryonic reanimation as a certainty by any means. You just have
<BR>
to think of all those egyptian (?) mummies being used as fuel - a century
<BR>
ago? It'll take time to get the technology, and time means change, no matter
<BR>
how strongly you hedge against it.
<BR>
<P>Pre-transhumanism, I always intended to donate my organs, etc, hopefully my
<BR>
brain would be used in the course of scientific work. I always imagined my
<BR>
skeleton ending up in the middle of some purile medical student practical
<BR>
joke; ahh the glory. So my brain ending up mush, and guiding future work,
<BR>
that's a noble end.
<BR>
<P>Being subjected to conditions of torture? Yowsa, it's hard to say yes to
<BR>
that. But I think, in this &quot;corporate upload comes first and fills the
<BR>
market&quot; scenario, whoever it is is going to have to put up with such
<BR>
treatment. urrgh. Wait a second, &quot;inordinately unpleasant, full of sensory
<BR>
deprivation, madness and pain&quot;? I'm a windows programmer. Come get me.
<BR>
<P>Seriously, ummm, yes. Yes, yes, yes. I'll regret this some decades hence
<BR>
when I'm screaming electronically for someone to kill me. Blech.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At best, someone considering using an old cryonic suspension patient for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these experiments would need to see a full legal document, laying out all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible circumstances, and describing whether the patient would permit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the experiment in each case.  Even then it is questionable whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject could fully understand the ramifications of what he is agreeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to, without having up to date information on the details of the procedure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It'll still be ok if you are  not considered legally alive. Is a cryonics
<BR>
patient considered legally alive? There's no legal question of consent,
<BR>
although there are some rules around corpses; I'm sure the cryonics
<BR>
enthusiasts know more about this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I believe a superior approach, if you want subjects for a destructive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upload, would be to use people on their deathbeds.  Promise to pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their families millions of dollars if they agree; give them all kinds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of documentation on the procedure and the possible consequences, good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and bad.  Give them tomes by philosophers and ethicists which will debate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether an upload could be alive, whether it would be the &quot;same&quot; person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as them, whether it would suffer or rejoice at its new life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh heh, with the first experiments, you probably can't afford to do any of
<BR>
that. You will get a long way in a short time, I would imagine, if you could
<BR>
do all kinds of not too ethical stuff. I would be quite unsurprised if the
<BR>
first experiments are performed under conditions where the subjects are
<BR>
considered legally dead (even if laws need to be changed to do it), and
<BR>
where Chalmer's work is used as the defining public justification for
<BR>
ethics, rather than say Dennett's; the idea being that any successful
<BR>
upload, especially from a dead person, is just another algorithm running on
<BR>
a machine, no special spark of consciousness, no biggy, nothing to see here
<BR>
folks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In this way you can get fully informed consent to the procedure, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can probably get a brain which is in much better shape than dragging out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a decades old cryonics patient from the 20th century.
</EM><BR>

<P>You might get a real fanatic on his deathbed to sign up for this kind of
<BR>
work. Wanna place odds on whether it gets done in a first or third world
<BR>
country? Really, you'd want to proceed somewhere where life is really cheap.
<BR>
Grubby stuff. How do I get in on the act?
