<EM>&gt; &gt; It sounds really cool; similiar to Utopia. Looks like they stole a time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; machine, came forward and saw Utopia, then went back in time and made
</EM><BR>
their
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; own copy. Or else Utopia is a rippoff.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect that Utopia is a son-of-son-of-son-of-Empire.
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Utopia is not a great game. It's fairly mediocre in my reckoning; it's
</EM><BR>
full
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of clunky fixes to try to retain game balance, each such resulting in
</EM><BR>
rule
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; changes so that each round, the rules have been changed to stop an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unbalanced tactic from the round before, and which invariably introduce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their own new problems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Empire went through the same process as people discovered loopholes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they were blocked which then made more complex loopholes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure the more rabid dynamists among us would find this an appealing
<BR>
metaphor; I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But it is 60,000 players, and an entirely simplistic abstract
</EM><BR>
geographical
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; model (if you want to think in terms of a map, it is as if you were
</EM><BR>
adjacent
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to every other player), that makes the game incredible. It is just soooo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many people; such a game is qualitatively different from any small scale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; game. Strategies that work for 2 adjacent opponents, or 4, or 20, do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; work for 60,000; new strategies emerge which are innapropriate in games
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; smaller numbers of players.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are adjacent to every other player, then it is N-dimensional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which is an interesting concept).  Empire was entirely reality based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (2-dimensional), which made the formation and keeping of treaties an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting exercise.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have found in multiplayer wargames with more than a few players (5 plus?),
<BR>
that this kind of N-dimensionality bogs the game down mightily. Usually
<BR>
there is some concept of &quot;attack&quot;, which allows you to damage an opponent
<BR>
and maybe improve your own position directly, but leaves you open to
<BR>
&quot;attack&quot; from others. With many players, everyone is afraid to &quot;go in&quot;,
<BR>
because they are almost guaranteed to cop more than one attack on them in
<BR>
response.
<BR>
<P>This effect seemed to be fairly linear; the more players, the more
<BR>
conservative (and endlessly boring) the play. Many strategy games employ
<BR>
special rules to limit the scope of each player (2d maps are a good
<BR>
example), to allow scalability.
<BR>
<P>Except that with 60,000 players, the effect almost dissapears. There are so
<BR>
many people, that hardly anyone has their eye on you; you often fight an
<BR>
opponent in splendid insignificance. Except someone does notice your
<BR>
temporary weak state sometimes, and sometimes that someone is a member of an
<BR>
online alliance that could be hundreds of people strong, and you are in
<BR>
deep, deep trouble. Or maybe that happens to your enemy.
<BR>
<P>I think, as I said in a previous post, that there is tremendous scope for
<BR>
social experiment by testing ideas in online games. You can attract
<BR>
thousands of volunteers free! These games usually include toy
<BR>
economic/political models. Why not try real ones? We might even learn
<BR>
something.
<BR>
<P>Something else that's been bugging me is a comment Robert made recently
<BR>
about games driving electronic/neural interface development. I'm wondering
<BR>
whether AI research has been boosted in at least some limited ways by the
<BR>
demand for good game AIs, and whether we are seeing significant decrease in
<BR>
that driver now that isolated people can find other actual humans (always
<BR>
more interesting opponents) to play against. Anyone know whether there
<BR>
effect is happening?
