<EM>&gt; How can we explain that girls get better grades (administered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjectively by teachers), while boys get better scores on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standardized tests (administered dispassionately by automated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems)?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the case even when grades /aren't/ subjective.  Grades
<BR>
and tests simply measure different things.  Tests generally
<BR>
measure individual acquired abstract knowledge at a point in time.
<BR>
Grades generally measure things like accomplishment and
<BR>
participation over a period of time.  A person who may not be
<BR>
very good at memorizing things for quick recall can nonetheless
<BR>
accomplish a lot with good organizational and social skills.
<BR>
<P>I aced every test I ever took, including, for example, in a
<BR>
required high school civics course I failed, and had to do extra
<BR>
credit work to be allowed to graduate.  I had to highest SAT
<BR>
scores in my class, but dropped out of junior college.  My sister
<BR>
on the other hand was organized and hard-working, formed good
<BR>
support groups, and had perfect grades; her SATs were good, but
<BR>
not great, and she did well in college too.  She earns more than
<BR>
I do, and for good reason: she had the discipline to work hard
<BR>
for a long time, establish trust and relationships, and rise up
<BR>
the ranks of her profession and be rewarded for it.  I, on the
<BR>
other hand, am a hired gun who's had 8 jobs over 20 years.  I do
<BR>
very well, but with a defferent set of tools.
<BR>
<P>There are different routes to success, and it should not be
<BR>
surprizing that different attempts to measure qualities of
<BR>
diverse people will come up with different answers for them.
<BR>
