<P><EM>&gt;Nope, I just read this in a several places, the only two of which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I recall definitely was in fiction: Niven's &quot;Oath of Fealty&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in one of his Known Space stories about the first Man-Kzin War.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I guess the reasoning is that operationally they may be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;efficient, but building them demands so much more design and labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work, as well as more expensive higher performance materials that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the resources used to support that overwhelm those saved in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;day to day operations. So long as building efficiencies discount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;savings beyond 10 years as much as they do, arcologies will always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be negative impactors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmm don't think I support your conclusions, but thanks for the
<BR>
info.
<BR>
<P>Now to support my version  www.arcosanti.org, the worlds most
<BR>
recent Arcology (since the pueblo?). I was delighted to see that
<BR>
there is much new going on here. The fact that Paolo Soleri is an
<BR>
artist as well as architect has always been interesting. There are
<BR>
some 70 people currently living at Arcosanti.
<BR>
<P>Also good news, the book &quot;Arcology: city in the image of man&quot; is
<BR>
once again available through the same URL. You can call and order
<BR>
by phone/credit card although it doesnt specifically say so.
