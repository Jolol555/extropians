<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked Nick's essay.  It was particularly refreshing that
<BR>
he avoided
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the references to the 1990s and the year 2000,
<BR>
trying to really
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;present a dialog that might have occured in 2050.
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks. One has to compromize in places and have the panellists explicitly
<BR>
describe things that by 2050 one could probably refer to directly using some
<BR>
new jargon. In the final version (just uploaded) I changed the dialogue a
<BR>
bit so that Emily comes across more consistently as the conservative.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not a big fan of transparency, so I wasn't thrilled with
<BR>
Nick's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reliance on that social convention as the explanation of why
<BR>
the world
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hadn't destroyed itself.
<BR>
<P><P>It's more than a mere convention: it's an actual global surveillance network
<BR>
with the major players willing to enforce the anti-proliferation laws.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transparency raises many difficult issues, as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have discussed here before.  While Nick's essay was not
<BR>
the place to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defend it, I was uncomfortable seeing his panelists give an
<BR>
endorsement
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a technology which I feel brings serious problems.
<BR>
<P><P>Tell me technology-solution to the goo-problem that is without potential
<BR>
serious complications! I used this postulate because I thought it gave the
<BR>
most convenient scenario of the world in 2050 which was both reasonably
<BR>
realistic and would allow me to discuss a wide range of transhumanist ideas
<BR>
(nanotech, goo, superintelligence, VR, cryonics, life-extension, Idea
<BR>
futures etc).
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was amusing to see the panelists consider the possibility
<BR>
that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe has multiple branches and that humanity has wiped
<BR>
itself out in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most of them.
<BR>
<P><P>Actually, Neil (the philosopher on the panel) is referring to possible
<BR>
extraterrestrial civilizations in our own (classical) universe.
<BR>
<P><P>It seems to me that since their personal experiences of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world have apparently not been harmed by the
<BR>
hypothetical deletion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of their cousins in other branches, they might well adopt
<BR>
the view that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no reason for caution with regard to new
<BR>
technologies.  As long
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as some branch survives with them in it then they will be as
<BR>
satisfied
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with life as they are at present, since they have already
<BR>
experienced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a similar pruning.
<BR>
<P><P>Even in the many-worlds picture (which was not referred to in the essay),
<BR>
this (&quot;quantum suicide&quot; idea) would not be correct. My view is that desire
<BR>
for survival would simply have to be reinterpreted as desire to survive on
<BR>
many branches with a high measure. All activities would then proceed as
<BR>
usual. And I am confident that virtually everybody would act in accordance
<BR>
with this reinterpretation.
