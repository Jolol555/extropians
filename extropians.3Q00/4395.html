<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;         Why do you not consider the &quot;SI&quot; as part of civilization?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Things will happen at ever increasing rate as we approach the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; singularity, but this will occur for all of civilization right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why/how would it occur to just one seed program all alone?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Because the SI will be developing at its own accelerated exponential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rates, while most of civilization will still be advancing at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; strictly biological, or at best augmented biological rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         What, is some God going to come down and say to us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;biologicals&quot; 'though shalt not ever super augment our ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biologically improve, and eventually cross over, upload, or to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever is required to keep up'?  I certainly plan altering myself in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any way necessary to keep up.  Don't you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes I do. I hope to do as much as possible. I do however, consider that the
<BR>
biological rate of thought will act, at least for some intitial time period, as
<BR>
a boat anchor to tie us down for at least a little while. That drag may act as a
<BR>
stabilizer to restrain us from zooming off into incomprehensible insanity, or
<BR>
may prevent us from reaching infinity until it is shucked. I don't know, and I
<BR>
also don't know which will come first, human mind uploading or SI creation....
