I'd raised a question as to whether Robin's recent essay, &quot;Is Fairness About 
<BR>
Clear Fitness Signals?&quot; correctly describes intuitions about fairness.  
<BR>
Specifically, I noted that leading professional philosophers apparently think 
<BR>
it more fair to redistribute the benefits of breeding (insofar as they can be 
<BR>
liquidated, of course;nobody talks about redistributing height, good looks, 
<BR>
wit, etc. per se) than to redistribute the benefits of character.  I further 
<BR>
suggested that &quot;folk philosophy&quot; may well embrace the same view.  Robin 
<BR>
replied:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I don't think you read my article (at <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/fairgene.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/fairgene.html</A>).
</EM><BR>
<P>I hadn't.  I've tried to, just now, but the darned thing won't load 
<BR>
completely.  Still, I got several paragraphs and it looks like I got some of 
<BR>
the conclusion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Thinking it is unfair for kids to get advantages from rich parents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (&quot;trust-fund kids&quot;) *is* one of the main predictions of my theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>To be more exact, I think that your theory would predict that we would think 
<BR>
it fair to let rich parents lavish money on their kids (a view I suspect that 
<BR>
most folks hold) but not necessarily fair to let those kids benefit from such 
<BR>
gifts (a view that, paradoxically or not, people also often hold).  Throwing 
<BR>
money at your kids very often signals genetic fitness.  Getting it from your 
<BR>
parents does so less reliably.  You say some things about charity that jibe 
<BR>
with that analysis.
<BR>
<P>So far, so good.  But you could argue that inheriting wealth from the same 
<BR>
source from which you inherit your genes signals genetic fitness.  Indeed, 
<BR>
counterintuitively, your theory seems to suggest that *adopted* trust fund 
<BR>
kids should be regarded as somehow less morally deserving than *natural* 
<BR>
ones!  The theory thus seems to vary from some moral intuitions. Or maybe 
<BR>
not; as you note, we really need better data about moral intuitions.  
<BR>
<P>I'm puzzled that you say, &quot;It seems unfair to suffer greatly from having one 
<BR>
or two specific bad genes.&quot;  Granted, that probably seems unfair to most 
<BR>
folks, but doesn't your theory in fact predict that people should regard such 
<BR>
bad genes as clear signals of unfitness, and thus that people should think 
<BR>
that suffering from them is not unfair?
