<P><EM>&gt;The cult thing.  Why not just *be* a cult?  What is sooo baaad

<EM>&gt;about just being a cult?  Own it!  If someone accuses us of being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a cult, why dont we just say, OK, you caught us, we are a cult,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we admit it.  Why not?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, not to burst your bubble (or lightbulb), but the problem is with the
<BR>
connotations of the word itself.  Most folks (myself included)automatically
<BR>
construe cults as being &quot;bad things&quot;...legions of mindless followers
<BR>
carrying candles, chanting senseless hymns and wearing velvet shrouds.  The
<BR>
actual Webster's definition is 1) &quot;...system of religious worship...rites
<BR>
and ceremonies;&quot; and 2) &quot;A group that devotes itself to or venerates a
<BR>
person, ideal, fad etc.&quot;  The second description is somewhat apt (though it
<BR>
could be applied to anything from perverse sects to little league baseball
<BR>
teams) but it is the first description that enters one's mind.
<BR>
<P>As Corwyn Alambar said in his &quot;Raping the Planets&quot; post last week, we need
<BR>
to avoid associations with terms that are commonly viewed as negative in
<BR>
the public eye, lest we become refugees.  In effect, calling Extropianism a
<BR>
cult would be both untrue as well as cause very serious repercussions to
<BR>
our future credibility.
