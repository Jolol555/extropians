<EM>&gt; &gt; Ah. Well, I thought I would ask, because if you were a believer in Gaea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Theory, then your use of the word spiritual to mean a 'connection' with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that entity, I would capitulate and agree your usage is appropriate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But in the Gaea Theory, the term Gaea would refer to a specific, bounded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entity, not &quot;surroundings&quot; or &quot;environment.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I would argue that my usage of environment as an 'entity' is strongly
<BR>
suggestive of Gaea Theory. While not a complete one to one mapping, I
<BR>
thought that perhaps I could winnow down our discussion to a belief that
<BR>
could possibly account for an appropriate use of the word spiritual by
<BR>
sort of jumping ahead to see if you subscribed to any of that belief.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Cause and effect link? Hmmm. I'm trying to see what you mean by this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; given the example you posted a while back. When you released the coyote,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that was the cause which generated the effect of being able to commune
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The cause of the communication which occurred between me and the coyote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could have been some as yet unidentified property of consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
So, you are certain that some kind of communication took place? Was this
<BR>
the main factor for your 'spiritual' feelings, or what is it a
<BR>
combination of things? Hmm. I think I'm asking you questions that you
<BR>
already stated you weren't sure you could answer. If so, feel free to
<BR>
dismiss them, unless you have recently garnered some insights into this.
<BR>
<P>I've found, more often than not, that the research done on animal/human
<BR>
communication is dubious at best and outright ridiculous at worst.
<BR>
Mostly due to the starting assumptions, but political and ideological
<BR>
agendas also contribute to the poor methodologies used in these programs
<BR>
of research. I'd be interested if you've come across any studies that
<BR>
you think are well done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Interesting. Why not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why not consider a feeling as an explanation?  Because a feeling is not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explanation. If you equate feelings with explanations you're throwing away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than just precision in language. To explain (according to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictionary) is to show logical development or relationships. To confuse this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a feeling or hunch would probably be fatal to me within a short time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since I work with dangerous stuff like electricity and chainsaws, and depend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on explanations of how plants grow and which wild plants are edible and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forth in oder to eat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Of course, where solid descriptions exist, established protocol has been
<BR>
generated, and a deep understanding is a priori, then feelings would
<BR>
appear only to muddy the waters. It is definitely true that you should
<BR>
go with what you understand and can explain when dealing with
<BR>
saw-toothed machines or tendrils of superhot light. But when you are
<BR>
talking about something that is difficult to describe, there doesn't
<BR>
appear to be any priors for  help in relating, and what you feel is most
<BR>
assuredly consigned to the realm of emotion and feelings, giving such an
<BR>
answer is acceptable as a *first* attempt. I don't advocate leaving it
<BR>
at the level of, &quot;Well, it's just how I feel.&quot;. I always ask the
<BR>
question, &quot;Why?&quot;, which I've done here. However, I'm quite prepared to
<BR>
accept an answer in the short term that is merely instinctual when
<BR>
dealing with matters that appear to beyond easy explanation. Like I said
<BR>
before, it should be revisited, but perhaps after some time has passed
<BR>
and your ability to describe with understandable language is better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Also, one of the definitions is an appeal to higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; emotions or an aesthetic sense, which definitely gets across the feeling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I believe you are describing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It's true that I experienced feelings in connection with the coyote.  These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feelings included surprise (to find the coyote in the fence), sorrow (that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the coyote had gotten her leg caught), happpiness (that she was still able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to run after I got her leg free), curiosity (&quot;Gee, I wonder how this coyote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is able to understand that I'm trying to help her&quot;), and what you might call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; love, in that I felt a kinship to the coyote, as one living thing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another. Maybe this last is what you mean by higher emotion?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Actually, it was in reference to your feeling of 'spiritual'. That's
<BR>
what I thought this whole conversation was about. Did I miss something,
<BR>
or give you the wrong impression about what it was I was trying to
<BR>
discern? Although, in this more detailed description I will tentatively
<BR>
say yes.
<BR>
<P>Have you ever felt that particular emotion/feeling with humans?
