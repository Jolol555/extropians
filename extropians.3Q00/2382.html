<P><EM>&gt; Uh, actually this argument fails to sway because it defines theft in very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simplistic terms.  You might not be stealing my music if you copy it, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you certainly are stealing my profit.  If you desire something that I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent energy producing, then it is clear that we should come to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrangement by which I should end up with something that you have spent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy producing (like, er, money for instance.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you saying that now I have to pay you for this response you just gave me?
<BR>
How much do you want, I'll get out my credit card number?  What?  This isn't the
<BR>
same?  How so?  You exerted creative energy coming up with it didn't you?  In
<BR>
the meantime, I'm going to take your above quote and use that idea to make
<BR>
millions arguing before the court system for the likes of Capitol Records and
<BR>
20th Century Fox.  Thanks!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By your argument, it should be legal to counterfeit money.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, now there's a great idea!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In fact, intellectual property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws protect... intellectual property, which by definition, has always been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tremendously easy to duplicate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so, that's the whole point of the RIAA lawsuit regardless of anything else
<BR>
they say.  They certainly are not arguing on the behalf of the artists.  If they
<BR>
were, then why are the only paying these poor bastards less than a dollar per
<BR>
CD?  Where is all that other money going.  Lets see, I'm thinking for a moment -
<BR>
I got it - the executives paychecks!!  Lets not forget those multi-million
<BR>
dollar hyping budgets in order to get N'Sync and Brittany Spears albums to
<BR>
market.  Give me a friggin break!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, actually, the real difference here is that blacksmiths were being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replaced by something that did their job better.  That's called progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly!  The internet is progress, so why don't you tell the RIAA to get the
<BR>
hell out of the way!  If an artist wants to use the internet to promote his
<BR>
music, and if he wants to create a way to play without it being re-produced -
<BR>
that's his responsibility.  Relying on governmental intervention to get the job
<BR>
done is ludicrous.  He made it, he promoted it, I listen to it.  I hear it on
<BR>
the radio, I hear it on MTV.  I recorded it on MTV.  I play it whenever I want.
<BR>
Then along comes Napster and I can find the same song and record it on my hard
<BR>
drive - and now it's a crime?  This is the most convoluted crap I have ever been
<BR>
dis-privaleged to expose my brain to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No one has proven that Napster is going to result in better music or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the removal of copyright is going to result in better drugs, coca-cola,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; filmmaking, literature, automobile design, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>No one has proven that its going to make music worse either.  Nothing can be
<BR>
worse than the over-marketed hype they call music now-a-days.  Then of course we
<BR>
have all the extremely talented musicians that I hear at small concerts around
<BR>
this part of the country.  They have not inked million dollar contracts, and
<BR>
their music is easily as good as the rich pop stars.  So what's motivating them
<BR>
- perhaps the pure love of music?  Oh I forgot, its not about the music in the
<BR>
end - its the money, money, moneyaaa, .....moneyaaaaa!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hey, Linux is not the only example of something really cool that people have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made without getting paid for it.  There will likely continue to be many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shining examples of what humans will do for free.  And humans will continue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to do really interesting things for free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Its just that they still have to spend a lot of their time doing things they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get paid for.
</EM><BR>
<P>For now yes, but thats the whole point of my argument.  There is going to come a
<BR>
point, when nanotechnology really hits hard and all this IP hogwash has to go.
<BR>
Because nanotechnology will give people the ability to replicate anything the
<BR>
want.  All intellectual property will do in the end, and increasingly
<BR>
totalitarian measures will be needed, is create a nano divide that makes the
<BR>
current digital divide look like a toddlers dispute.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And just because an operating system is better when lots of people can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in there and move things around doesn't mean that, oh, say, a movie will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better if lots of people can get in there and move things around.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah yes, but intellectual property is being used to squash new technologies and
<BR>
eliminate the real potential of what the internet is.  If the movie studios
<BR>
cannot figure out how to make a profit in the age of the internet, then maybe
<BR>
they need to seriously examine everything they do - including the medium of the
<BR>
movie itself.  Otherwise they need to create ways to distribute their movies
<BR>
with uncrackable encryption.  But if I crack it I get it.
