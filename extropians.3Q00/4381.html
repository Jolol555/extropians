<P>
I would like to state that I did not intend to offend Paul as much as he seems
<BR>
to be offended. For that he has my apology.
<BR>
<P>Living in northern New England, and growing up here, I've absorbed quite a bit
<BR>
of the Yankee ethic. Aphorisms tend to be common as 'rules for living' round
<BR>
these parts. I guess what I was trying to say was &quot;If your not part of the
<BR>
solution, you are part of the problem&quot; or something like that. Other things,
<BR>
like &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; spring to mind. A Yankee does care about
<BR>
his neighbors, especially those in hard times, and will do what he can
<BR>
personally to help them, but he highly resents other people deciding how his or
<BR>
her money should be spent to 'solve' other people's problems. A Yankee knows
<BR>
that its best to teach a starving man to fish, and that good fences make good
<BR>
neighbors. He is highly suspicious of the big headed nonsense that know-it-all
<BR>
city slickers think they 'know', but is not reticent to use what can be seen to
<BR>
really work with one's own eyes. A person who continues to insist the sky is
<BR>
green in spite of the facts can frequently be expected to meet with scorn,
<BR>
dismissal, or sometimes pity, but rarely with respect.
<BR>
<P>Paul's claims of concern for the poor I also share. However, my opinions about
<BR>
the proper prescription for what ails them are not founded in elitism as he
<BR>
assumes, but from personal experience as a former member of that class. I was
<BR>
once homeless, unemployed, and dead broke. There were no government bureaucrats
<BR>
there to cut me checks to help me along, because I was a single, straight, able
<BR>
bodied white male. Growing up here in northern New Hampshire, I had seen rural
<BR>
poverty first hand, ranging from a period as a child when my father was
<BR>
unemployed from his job as an engineer, my mother supported the family on her
<BR>
med tech job, and when dad was employed, the glut of engineers on the market
<BR>
kept salaries down around $3500 a year in the early 70's. Many of the kids I
<BR>
grew up with were dirt poor, such that a pair of shoes were their christmas
<BR>
present more often than not, and knowing the parents of these kids formed a
<BR>
rather distinct impression of the sort of people who live in chronic poverty
<BR>
generation after generation.
<BR>
<P>When I got out of the Air Force during the recession of 1991, Boeing had
<BR>
rescinded a job offer due to a hiring freeze, and I arrived in Seattle with few
<BR>
prospects and a quickly dwindling savings. Homelessness followed, but 6 months
<BR>
later I had three jobs, was back in school, and off the streets. A year later I
<BR>
had launched a business with two other people, and was responsible for
<BR>
pioneering energy conservation technology. I have never once received a single
<BR>
cent of government assistance. Indeed, I was defrauded of many thousands of
<BR>
dollars of benefits that I had specifically paid for and earned from my military
<BR>
service by that government.
<BR>
<P>So you see Paul, I don't come to the debate here with any sort of elitist
<BR>
attitudes. Nor are they fascist as you would like to accuse me of being while
<BR>
hiding behind some anonymous third parties. Rather, it is the sort of big
<BR>
government palliatives that you have said are needed to 'keep the market in
<BR>
check' that are the real fascist policies. Fascism is incompatible with
<BR>
individualism, despite all that the socialistic types in the intelligentsia
<BR>
would like to claim. It has been demonstrated here time and again the historical
<BR>
facts about the communalist/socialist nature of fascism.
<BR>
<P>One reason that poverty cannot be addressed by government is due to the failing
<BR>
of the 'one size fits all' nature of government solutions (especially fascist
<BR>
solutions). As someone once said, &quot;every happy family is happy in exactly the
<BR>
same way, but those in misery are each miserable in their own unique way.&quot; There
<BR>
are general prescriptions that can help, but they all require the active,
<BR>
energetic initiative and participation of the beneficiary. Education, for
<BR>
instance, does not happen by osmosis, as any college professor on this list can
<BR>
attest, and it is education that can contribute the greatest amount to helping
<BR>
the poor become individuals of acheivement. The competetive ethic can also
<BR>
contribute greatly, but this is also something that require the individual
<BR>
initiative of the beneficiary. It is not an accident that professional sports,
<BR>
which is the most open to minorities, and which does not conflict with a
<BR>
traditional lower class distain for book learning, receives such attention from
<BR>
those minorities, and has contributed much to helping to reinfuse the
<BR>
competetive spirit into the disaffected.
