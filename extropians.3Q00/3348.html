<P><EM>&gt; Wars are always going to be warlike.. Some of them are fought for more

<EM>&gt; &quot;human&quot; reasons than others. People tend to get shot no matter what,
</EM><BR>
though.
<BR>
<P>You might be right, but the best test of this, since we can't plumb the
<BR>
minds of all the actors yet, I think, is if the war is purely defensive.
<BR>
Granted, not all nations on the defensive are fighting a just war, but it
<BR>
would seem more likely, a nation fighting in defense is one that has been
<BR>
attacked.  Prima facie, that would make it look like a just war -- for it
<BR>
not its attacker.
<BR>
<P>However, this does bring up the issue of leading attackers on (which some
<BR>
believe the US government did with the Japanese Empire in 1941) and also of
<BR>
preemptive strikes (e.g., the Six Day War).  On the former, to me, attacks
<BR>
always given the odor of being unjust and wrong, though one must dig deeper
<BR>
and make reasonable conclusions.  Did the American government expect an
<BR>
attack?  Did it do anything to lead the Japanese government on?  Was that
<BR>
the most likely outcome of its policies?  Did the people in charge know
<BR>
this?  If they did not, should they have?  All of these are enough to fill a
<BR>
book and I'm not a scholar of World War Two.  I'm only using it to
<BR>
illustrate this problem here.
<BR>
<P>Regarding the latter, I lean very strongly against the attacker, even if the
<BR>
attacker is a democracy with much more freedoms than it adversaries, as in
<BR>
the Six Day War.  (Strange thing is a lot of democracies seem to be very
<BR>
militaristic on the whole.  Examples include, the US, UK, France, India, and
<BR>
Israel.  Yeah, there are plenty of counterexamples, but the Kantian
<BR>
democracy brings peace argument has to come to grips with all the data,
<BR>
especially since the ones I list are some of the most democratic nations in
<BR>
their regions or have a long history of democracy.)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
