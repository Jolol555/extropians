<P>You hit in directly on the nail Phil!  I couldn't have said it better myself!

Aa I suggested early on in this thread, free-market in and of itself is not
<BR>
necessarily the problem, but is obviously integrated with the fact that you have
<BR>
a monopolized and centralized state that can be bought.  What is the
<BR>
alternative? That has been one of the thrusts of my argument.  It must still be
<BR>
asked how can a free-market effectively enable a social contract that would
<BR>
minimize loss of individual civil liberties, maximize individual freedom and
<BR>
prosperity.  Notice that I placed special emphasis on the individual.
