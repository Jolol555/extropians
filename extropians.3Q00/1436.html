<EM>&gt; 80,000 lines in 3 months is about 900 lines a day. You'd have to hit the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caffeine pretty hard, but it could be done. The 10 lines/day metric is for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bug free code, and wraps up the entire software development lifecycle I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think, at least coding+testing+maintenance, which justifies that tiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figure. Really, us coders are not such slobs that we can only manage 10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lines of code a day!
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes, the 10 lines/day metric includes all direct and indirect development
<BR>
and support costs, so it doesn't really reflect coding speed per se.  Note
<BR>
that this type of accounting is how you apparently have the government
<BR>
spending $400 on a hammer and similar; they include the direct and
<BR>
indirect costs at all steps of acquisition/production rather than using
<BR>
the &quot;on paper&quot; purchase price.  While arguably more accurate, it isn't an
<BR>
intuitive accounting methodology for the layman.
<BR>
<P>However, 80k lines of good code in 3 months does sound a bit far-fetched. 
<BR>
30k LoC in 8 months is very reasonable though.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I bet that 30,000 or 80,000 lines of code was riddled with bugs!
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It depends on the programmer and the environment.  For example, I write
<BR>
nearly bug-free code using C on UNIX at an extremely high number of
<BR>
LoC/day, but tend to have much buggier code and program at a slower
<BR>
rate if I do something in, say, Perl.  For me, these two environments
<BR>
pretty much represent both the best and worst case scenarios for
<BR>
environments that I commonly use.  C++, Java, and various 4GLs fall
<BR>
somewhere in the middle.  I'm sure there are programmers whose coding
<BR>
preferences with respect to bugginess are exactly opposite of mine.
<BR>
<P>I have a suspicion that people who are really good at programming have
<BR>
brains that are wired slightly differently than the rest of the
<BR>
population.  Every really good natural programmer I have known was able
<BR>
to write nearly bug-free code very fast in their preferred environment. 
<BR>
This doesn't actually speak for the efficiency of the environment, only
<BR>
for the particular way a programmer is wired.  However, in my experience
<BR>
the majority of people working as programmers don't have an innate
<BR>
cognitive ability with respect to programming and tend to write relatively
<BR>
buggy code in any environment by comparison.  Every successful development
<BR>
team seems to have at least one &quot;natural&quot; programmer on board, and a
<BR>
disproportionate percentage of the final codebase is typically written by
<BR>
these individuals.
