<P>
I'll say if the destructive scan procedure is 10% likely to work, I'm in
<BR>
(given that I'm a corpsicle). I'd like to say a higher number, but I think
<BR>
I'm likely to be outcompeted. I'm not quite willing to go lower, although I
<BR>
suspect I might still be too conservative.
<BR>
<P>When you pick a particular chance for success, you are betting that all the
<BR>
prior experiments, done before that level of sophistication is reached, will
<BR>
fail. At the 90% chance level, I think you are almost a dead certainty (ooh)
<BR>
to miss the first wave. Big critter cloning is like this currently, is it
<BR>
not; many failures, very few successes? Dolly is a really lucky gambler.
<BR>
<P>A ramble, which will lead back to the main point:
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------
<BR>
I've been playing an online game, Utopia, for the last few months. It's a
<BR>
massively mutliplayer strategy games (press says 60,000 players, and I think
<BR>
that's actually about right).
<BR>
<P>In this game, you play a fantasy province; Orcs, elves dwarves, halflings
<BR>
(yawn, yep same old stuff). It has a interestingly simplistic geographic
<BR>
model - there's no map, you just exist in this abstract world, with a
<BR>
certain amount of acres of land, all kinds of production statistics and
<BR>
settings which lead ultimately to an expansion rate of population
<BR>
(particularly limited by land) and income level (production rate of gold).
<BR>
You use those things to make an army, and you use your army to get more
<BR>
land.
<BR>
<P>The bread and butter of the game is land. Your amount of land drives &amp;
<BR>
bounds all other aspects of your province. When you attack someone and
<BR>
succeed, you get an amount of their land, and they lose that amount. Land is
<BR>
totally abstract, just a single integer value.
<BR>
<P>The interesting thing is that there are various inputs to the game which
<BR>
cause the mean level of land to increase over time (the actual mechanism is
<BR>
that new players who don't understand the game too well turn up constantly,
<BR>
are allotted an initial amount of land, fail to cope, and drop out, losing
<BR>
all that initial allotment to other players in the process; it becomes
<BR>
subsumed into the greater land economy).
<BR>
<P>Also (and even without that growth factor), larger provinces dominate
<BR>
smaller ones; they have larger armies. So, amongst really clued in players,
<BR>
there is exponential growth, limited by the number of other players who are
<BR>
at a similar size to you (because you cannot grow effectively by hitting
<BR>
players far smaller than you, due to various game mechanics).
<BR>
<P>The game is reset every 2 months or so; everyone starts anew. This is
<BR>
because by about that stage, there is no hope for new players to make any
<BR>
kind of decent go at getting ahead; the game becomes strongly stratified.
<BR>
<P>When you start from the reset point, and have really sophisticated tactics
<BR>
(people have written incredibly elaborate software, some of which is freely
<BR>
available, for generating and testing strategies offline), the game has a
<BR>
very interesting character. Specifically, as time goes on, the size of the
<BR>
largest provinces in the game increases (exponentially). If you are one of
<BR>
those largest provinces, initially you must play a very tight game indeed to
<BR>
stay out the front of the pack. This has enormous advantages; later, when
<BR>
you are one of the biggest, you almost never get attacked (no one else is
<BR>
big enough). If you are slightly below the size of the largest provinses,
<BR>
you get hit occassionally (by the biggest, who are few), which slows your
<BR>
growth further. If you are nowhere near the front of the pack, you get hit
<BR>
quite often, which costs you heaps economically even if the attacks fail;
<BR>
thus your size, over time and relatively speaking, falls far below that of
<BR>
the leaders.
<BR>
<P>It's a really fantastic example of the founder effect. Even though it is a
<BR>
highy dynamic and highly competive situation, if you lead, your are more
<BR>
than likely to continue to lead. If you are in front from the start, the
<BR>
game is a lot easier than if you are trying to come up from below; you can
<BR>
achieve the same effect with far less risk. This becomes more true as the
<BR>
game stratifies further, and there are less and less people who can truly be
<BR>
considered to be at the top (countered only by the fact that once there are
<BR>
only a few really big ones, they can identify each other, and can tend to
<BR>
attack each other out of vanity, to become the truly top province; provinces
<BR>
that get involved in such spats tend to find that neither is a contender in
<BR>
fairly short order, as they waste each other's resources.)
<BR>
<P>A countering effect also is that once you are clearly out amongst the front
<BR>
few, there is a tendency to rest on your laurels; falling from the front
<BR>
creeps up on you gradually, and by the time you notice it is often too late
<BR>
(happened to me this round).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, what's my point? Experience of the founder effect in this kind of
<BR>
environment is incredibly instructive if you want to really understand what
<BR>
it means. To be first, you have to go to extraordinary lengths. Also, you
<BR>
have to take some quite extraordinary risks. Why is this?
<BR>
<P>In a game like Utopia, I would estimate that as the round starts, there is
<BR>
something in the order of 5,000 truly competent players on the starting
<BR>
blocks; these are players who have played before, and/or have researched the
<BR>
net resources (extensive!) to find out how to have an optimum start. They
<BR>
all have a roughly equivalent chance of getting to the top 50 (the winners
<BR>
group), as there is not that much randomness involved in the game (except,
<BR>
of course, that of the combined decisions made by 60,000 players, hmm). By
<BR>
the end, there is quite a difference between the top and bottom of the top
<BR>
50, and they are, in aggregate, incredibly far ahead of the average player.
<BR>
<P>The truly clued up players, who are going for glory, know that you cannot
<BR>
play a conservative game and get to top spot. Say you have an oportunity to
<BR>
take a risk which you estimate is 50% likely to put you significantly ahead,
<BR>
and 50% likely to stuff up and be quite detrimental; knock you right out of
<BR>
the top league (a very common situation in Utopia). I would normally, as a
<BR>
relatively conservative wargamer, not take such a risk. However, in Utopia,
<BR>
there are so many players, that the story is quite different to your usual
<BR>
wargame including a handful of players. If you have choices to take risks
<BR>
like this, so do other players. Some of them will blow out, and some will
<BR>
succeed. In a short amount of time, the top leagues will be made up only of
<BR>
these who took the risk and succeeded. When you add a bunch of such
<BR>
decisions on top of each other, most risk takers tend to get weeded out. But
<BR>
the top provinces, the truly powerful ones, are made up of those players who
<BR>
beat the odds. They are no better than the players who took the risk and
<BR>
failed. Just luckier.
<BR>
<P>(I'm getting the wind up signal from the floor manager) Situations like the
<BR>
proposed upload race, where the first really successful uploads will be
<BR>
those that dominate the social environment, whatever that may be, remind me
<BR>
a lot of the Utopia style situation. I think we can assume that there will
<BR>
be quite a lot of people who understand the potential of being amongst the
<BR>
first uploads, and judge a given risk of failure to be preferable to their
<BR>
more mundane alternatives (deep freeze, or else lives which they value
<BR>
less). Some of those people will choose a very high risk level, in order to
<BR>
be first. If there are enough of those people, success will occur at that
<BR>
extremely high risk level (because at least a couple of them will succeed).
<BR>
And we are only talking about needing to get a handful of uploads done, if
<BR>
more than one, is that correct? I'm betting (based on nothing) that at
<BR>
around 10% success probability, you are still in the front wave.
<BR>
<P>But as usual, I'm probably being overly conservative.
<BR>
<P>Emlyn
<BR>
<P>(By the way, I think there's huge potential for testing the base concepts of
<BR>
parts of dynamic social systems in the online gaming environment. You don't
<BR>
need to simulate what people will do in a given situation, you can get real
<BR>
people to make the decisions. Has anyone tried using the online massive
<BR>
multiplayer game environment for serious research?)
