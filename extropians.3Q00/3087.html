<EM>&gt; &gt; Both present excellent analyses of the war and its outcome (to date,
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is).  Also, in Posen's article, he cites the &quot;Rambouillet Agreement:
</EM><BR>
Interim
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo&quot; at

<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html">http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; During an exchange on this list with Michael Lorrey, I also cited it,
</EM><BR>
but,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sadly, the above URL was not active at the time.  (I'd read the
</EM><BR>
agreement
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on-line, but could not find any government web pages with the agreement,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; save for those of the Serbian government.  The above source is the US
</EM><BR>
State
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Department.)  Now it's back up.  Please read, especially, &quot;Appendix B:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Status of Multi-National Military Implementation Force.&quot;  This was the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; agreement before the war began and some believe that this particular
</EM><BR>
section
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was put into the agreement -- along with several others -- to make sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Serbia (FRY, or whatever you want to call it) would not sign the
</EM><BR>
agreement,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thereby giving NATO, especially the US, a chance to bomb.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course, other parts of the agreement might have also pushed Serbia's
</EM><BR>
back
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the wall.  It's also interesting to note in what key ways the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; situation differs from that of the original agreement, if one is to
</EM><BR>
judge
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the success for any side of the war.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The thing is is that the conditions set forth in Appendix B are not very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different from the agreements that all NATO member nations have to sign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to host NATO troops.
</EM><BR>
<P>FRY/Serbia is not a NATO member.  NATO is a defensive alliance.  Originally,
<BR>
it was only intended to last about a decade, and then was mainly as a
<BR>
counter to potential Soviet invasion of Western Europe.  Yugoslavia was
<BR>
never a member of this alliance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The differences being there specifically because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Serbia was, in fact, an agressor nation in opposition to NATO.
</EM><BR>
<P>An aggressor nation is generally defined as one that attacks other nations.
<BR>
Since Kosovo was (and de jure still is) part of FRY, this claim falls flat.
<BR>
Also, before the war began, it's still arguable whether the aggression was
<BR>
more than counter-terrorist operations.  (Arguable, though not certain.)
<BR>
<P>The same applies to Kosovar Albanians, the KLA, and even Albania.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given the opportunity to cooperate prior to the bombing
</EM><BR>
<P>The cooperation was limited to accepting the agreement or being bombed.
<BR>
That's not much more than pure coercion.  Notably, neither the Kosovar
<BR>
Albanians nor the FRY had input into the drafting of the agreement.  This
<BR>
was &quot;take it or leave it&quot; diplomacy.  (You might argue that the Serbian
<BR>
government deserves no better, but the cost of such a stance is not only the
<BR>
effort spent bombing, but also innocents being killed, both Serbian and
<BR>
Albanian, etc.  Also, one might ask, did American negotiators really want an
<BR>
agreement all sides could agree to that would protect Kosovar Albanians AND
<BR>
address Serbian concerns about the KLA or was the goal to push Serbia into a
<BR>
corner then bomb?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; is markedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different from the options Serbia gave the other republics when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; declared indiependence. Serbia just started bombing and shooting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-serbians by the thousands.
</EM><BR>
<P>Also, some of this is expected behavior.  Secessions on the whole are not
<BR>
tolerated by whatever they are seceding from.  Note the cases of the
<BR>
American Colonies seceding from Great Britain, the CSA seceding from the
<BR>
USA, East Timor seceding from Indonesia, Chechnya seceding from Russia, and
<BR>
the Kurds attempting to seceded from Turkey, Iraq, and Iran.  In all of
<BR>
these cases, violent methods were used to suppress the rebellions.
<BR>
<P>This does not make such suppression good or right, but it's considered
<BR>
natural behavior for nation states.  Ones that can't or won't do that,
<BR>
generally, do not continue to exist for long.
<BR>
<P>(I'm generally pro-Secession, even in this case.  I'd like to see a
<BR>
libertarian-minarchist government arise, not one that is merely ethnically
<BR>
pure and oppresses whatever minorities exist within its borders.  No side
<BR>
promises that.  Such a government would be ethnicity neutral, of course.  I
<BR>
don't think the UN or NATO can make that happen.  I offer no plan for making
<BR>
it happen, though I stress American taxpayers should not be used to pay for
<BR>
such things anyway.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You really don't have much to stand on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here trying to make Milosevic look like the victim.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not trying to make Milosevic or the Serb government look like victims
<BR>
here.  My goal is merely to give more evidence in this discussion.  I'm not
<BR>
pro-Serb or pro-Milosevic.  At the same time, I do think the US and NATO got
<BR>
involved in a basically counterproductive war where many innocents suffered.
<BR>
Many more Albanians and Serbians died during the war.
<BR>
<P>I think NATO member populations were propagandized into accepting the war.
<BR>
Surely, Milosevic and the Serbian government are not nice, good, just, etc.
<BR>
But, at the same time, there are much worse problems in the world (Turkish
<BR>
treatment of Kurds being perhaps the most glaring one, since Turkey is a
<BR>
NATO member and a US client state) and I feel this was more Monica's War
<BR>
than anything else.
<BR>
<P>But to be more constructive here: how would Extropians in general deal with
<BR>
such problems?  One would hope our bright technological future would make
<BR>
ethnic rivalries less a problem, yet the 1990s seemed like a time when both
<BR>
technology progressed and ethnic rivalries and even wars increased.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
