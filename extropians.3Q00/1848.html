<P><EM>&gt; I would be very surprised if Mitre doesn't produce a molecular computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and win the Feynman Prize within the next 3-4 years.  I'd be even more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprised if HP/IBM/Lucent do not demonstrate prototype molecular computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; within the next 3-8 years.

<P>Robert,
<BR>
<P>You are a Foresight Senior Associate, aren't you?  If so, you should invest 
<BR>
some money in the Foresight Idea Futures market so you can publicly stand 
<BR>
behind your prediction and make some money on it.  Senior Associates can
<BR>
join 
<BR>
the market by sending money to the Foresight office.  So far, all the people 
<BR>
who have joined have done so at one of the face-to-face gatherings, but
<BR>
we've 
<BR>
recently decided to allow people to join anytime.
<BR>
<P>At this point the amount of money in the market is fairly small, but I'm hoping
<BR>
(by encouraging Senior Associates to join the market, and gradually
<BR>
expanding 
<BR>
to others interested in the future) to make it much bigger.  
<BR>
<P>The date of the Feynman Grand Prize was the subject of some of the most active
<BR>
claims on the exchange at the gathering in May.  There are three claims
<BR>
saying 
<BR>
that the prize will be won by 2010, by 2015, and by 2020.  Before the gathering
<BR>
the market put the odds at 60-65% of an award by 2020, 30-40% by 2015, and 
<BR>
15-18% by 2010.  At this year's meeting someone believed that the prizes are 
<BR>
pretty likely to be awarded by 2010, and a near certainty by 2015, and so
<BR>
they 
<BR>
bought up all the offered coupons available for less than 90. Others saw
<BR>
this 
<BR>
activity, and quickly bid the prices back down. At the moment, the odds are 
<BR>
listed as follows: for 2010 25-30; for 2015 40-50; and for 2020 65-75. 
<BR>
<P>There's a longer report I wrote on the IF activities at the gathering on Nanodot:

<BR>
<P>People on this list who are not Foresight Senior Associates can find out
<BR>

<BR>
