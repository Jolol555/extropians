&lt;snipped some of the prior thread&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I wasn't talking about secrecy, just keeping it out of people's faces.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People seem to accept &quot;taking advantage&quot; of others in all sorts of ways as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long as it isn't vivid to them.  People give to panhandlers and say no to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mailed charity letters.  People happily buy products from foreigners
</EM><BR>
working
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in conditions they would be outraged to see their neighbors working in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Plus, what are the odds that the destructive upload is going to work,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;first time?  Most things don't.  A number of people are going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;killed before you get an upload that works.  The moral opposition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;such an effort would be overwhelming, especially when it comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people who will be put out of work if it succeeds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again to get upset about the destruction of a frozen head you had to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept it as alive in the first place.  And the risk of a destructive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scan failing to pick up the relevant info is different from the risk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of any one simluation not being tuned right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now opposition due to fears of being put out of work is a whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different matter.  But it isn't the same thing as these other &quot;moral&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerns you've mentioned.

<P>If I was in a position to be cryonically suspended (which I don't think I am
<BR>
in Oz), I think I would make it very, very clear that I *volunteer* for the
<BR>
first uploading experiments. All the better if the general public thinks I'm
<BR>
dead, it is likely to be very difficult to organise if you fit the more
<BR>
commonly accepted definition of being alive. I would hope that someone alive
<BR>
at the time of the experiments actually gave a damn about me, and where I
<BR>
eventually ended up, but if not, well, I'd still rather be on the front
<BR>
line. Exploit me, I don't care; becoming one of the first few Posthumans has
<BR>
got to come with a price tag. And ye gods, the payoff...
