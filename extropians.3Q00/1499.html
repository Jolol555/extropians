Warcraft and Starcraft are two world conquering games I've gotten into, but 
<BR>
seem to remain a hopeless neophyte compared to others, despite many hours 
<BR>
and days oftime wasted playing. I stupidly logged onto battlenet to try my 
<BR>
hand against others at Warcraft and promptly got my ass handed to me several 
<BR>
times.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I feel your pain!!  I tend now to only play checkers online! :)  At least I 
<BR>
do win sometimes.
<BR>
<P>I have read that Starcraft is hugely popular in South Korea where they have 
<BR>
heated tournaments.  Their national champion has the nickname &quot;fingers of 
<BR>
God!&quot;  The U.S. grand champion who went there was washed up by the early 
<BR>
semi-finals!
<BR>
<P>Blizzard games rented a huge stadium there and paid back the loyal customer 
<BR>
base by having actors in costumes re-enact battles between humans, zerg, and 
<BR>
protoss.  The crowd went absolutely insane and continuously cheered as the 
<BR>
act continued.
<BR>
<P>Young South Korean women are reported to be getting lonely because the guys 
<BR>
are playing games and not socializing in the chat rooms!  In Korean 
<BR>
cyberspace there are several women for every guy!
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John
