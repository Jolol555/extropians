<P><EM>&gt; Your slippery slope argument is is... uh... dumb.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for saying so, I think yours is as idiotic as well.  Now can we please
<BR>
get back to being civil?  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Oh, what, you want to protect your ideas?!  Oh, I suppose you're going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to charge for every word you speak!  I suppose you're going to want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charge people for seeing what you look like it public!  I suppose you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to want to track down every time your name is uttered and send someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bill!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ultimately isn't that what your asking?  You said it yourself, IP laws are there
<BR>
to protect the creative works of others in order for them to profit from it.
<BR>
Before you get too hot and bothered I am playing devils advocate to see how far
<BR>
this will go. The IP laws as they are currently written could allow people like
<BR>
the RIAA to completely squelch progress.  In fact several astute lawyers have
<BR>
said that Patel's decision could easily apply to the web itself.  After all, the
<BR>
web allows people to transfer mp3's just like Napster does.  Yes, you and I know
<BR>
that both technologies are slightly different. But have you bothered to read
<BR>
current IP law and how judges like Patel and the RIAA are interpreting them? If
<BR>
anyone is on a slippery slope here it is you.  Where is the line drawn?  Quite
<BR>
frankly the lines being drawn are completely arbitrary and are at the whim of
<BR>
those with the biggest money to throw at the legal system.  Might here does not
<BR>
make right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Isn't there a nice reasonable attractor state somewhere between &quot;absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictatorial control over IP&quot; and &quot;absolute elimination of IP?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I would hope so, but no one seems to be debating this as bluntly as I am.
<BR>
Almost everyone says we must keep IP laws to protect creators, the economy, etc.
<BR>
without seeing the full ramifications of what those IP laws can do when they are
<BR>
abused.  I *am* questioning the who kitten caboodle, including the legal and
<BR>
corporate system as it is now.  Lets play this out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; By your argument, it should be legal to counterfeit money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hey, now there's a great idea!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Strangely enough, millions would disagree.  I guess they have some naive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notion that it might devalue the entire economy.
</EM><BR>
<P>So your one of those people who wants to keep money monopolized by the Federal
<BR>
Reserve?  Why then are you on the Extropian List?  Have you not heard of
<BR>
encrypted anonymous e-cash?  What we really need is competing currencies!  If a
<BR>
particular currency can be easily counterfeited, then yes it becomes devalued.
<BR>
What's this does for the economy is loosen up how capital is controlled, by
<BR>
democratizing the money supply.  In a competitive currency system, those
<BR>
currencies with the best reputation and stability become the dominant players.
<BR>
Besides who do you think are the greatest counterfeiters of US currency?  The US
<BR>
government.  As soon as the gold standard was removed the US decided to print
<BR>
themselves loads of it.  We are still trying to recover from such a debacle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hmm, I'm not following this argument.  Would you mind trying again?
</EM><BR>
<P>Quite simply the RIAA is using the current IP laws to protect their monopoly of
<BR>
music distribution.  Only now after Napster are some of them willing to consider
<BR>
another means of distribution.  Since the benefits of distributing music over
<BR>
the internet are plain obvious, had their been true competition in the first
<BR>
place, several companies would have already been doing this years ago.  Again,
<BR>
here we see IP laws being used by those with the money to protect their
<BR>
antiquated way of doing business.  Had their been true competition, I think the
<BR>
overall quality of music would be much better than it is now, because competiton
<BR>
assures that market forces (you and me) determine what music is played, not who
<BR>
is hyped the most.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let me try to simplify it for you then:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scenario A: He make music.  Radio promote music.  He sell music.  Radio sell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advertising.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Result A: They provide a service and get paid for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK this is getting really funny.  It's ok for me to record music for my own use
<BR>
as long as that source contains advertising, but illegal and piracy if I record
<BR>
music from non-adverstising sources?  I can just see it now, advertising becomes
<BR>
compulsory!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think it's very nice that you want to rely on an individual's pure love of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their art form to ensure high quality product.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, what I'm saying is if the *only* thing motivating an artists is the pursuit
<BR>
of money then maybe he shouldn't be an artist.  But lets get are facts straight,
<BR>
most artists are prolific creators regardless of the money supply.  Most artist
<BR>
actually enjoy the act of creation.  Sure I want them to make money.  But the
<BR>
current monopolized recording industry does more to squash creative artists than
<BR>
promote them.  Sure this is my opinion. but it is shared  overwhelming by the
<BR>
majority of musicians (including myself) who I know.  And yes we are having
<BR>
similar debates amongst ourselves at open-mike nights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Many communists use the argument that capitalism approaches fascism.  Again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these slippery slope arguments are reactionary.  I agree that vast economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gulfs already exist.  Does it follow that the solution is to eliminate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership?
</EM><BR>
<P>You seem to keep missing the point - physical and intellectual property are not
<BR>
the same.  One is limited, the other can be replicated at next to no cost.
<BR>
Please do not confuse them again.  Please see my car analogy if you need a
<BR>
refresher. Duplication is not theft in any traditional sense of the word as much
<BR>
as many would like to think it is. Lets get back to the real crux of this issue
<BR>
- how not to destroy the economy and perpetuate technological progress in the
<BR>
face of extremely cheap duplication costs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It appears to me that people who rail against the divide seem remarkably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blind to a lot of the benefits unequal distribution of weath confers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please tell that to the other 90% of the world who feel lucky for having clean
<BR>
water and a place to live.  Sheesh!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You say squash, I say foster.  You say these rules are crippling our growth,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I say that they are responsible for it.  (Uh, we -are- growing, right?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Now that we have the internet, IP laws will do more to cripple growth than help
<BR>
it.  And I'm referring here to growth for the entire population not just the
<BR>
ones at the top.  But this all begs the question that IP laws will become
<BR>
increasingly difficult to enforce as the power of duplication continues to
<BR>
multiply.  Napster smapster.  Now we have Gnutella, Freenet and Mojo Nation.
<BR>
Either these advancing technologies will make IP law completely unenforceable
<BR>
and irrelevant (my argument) or increasingly draconian measures will need to be
<BR>
taken by the centralized governments of the world to maintain them (your
<BR>
argument?).
