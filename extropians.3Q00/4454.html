<P><EM>&gt;Apologies to the long time members of the list, I've said all this before.

Ah, very well presented.  This is the essense of the anarcho-capitalist 
<BR>
position as I understood it circu 1969.  And it's still correct.  The only 
<BR>
difference is that now we actually have the means to get from here to there. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the '60's thru the early '80's, I think that most of us were still 
<BR>
counting on the catastrophic collapse of the state, burying our barrels of 
<BR>
red wheat, etc., and planning to be the anarchist vanguard after the deluge.
<BR>
<P>However, people and civilizations have stumbled along in spite of the state 
<BR>
for a very long time.  The state poses some increased danger now that the 
<BR>
costs of wiping out the species via bioweapons, etc. has become real and is 
<BR>
falling exponentially in cost.  I don't see the state as being capable of 
<BR>
providing the level of security, surveillance, etc., necessary to ultimately 
<BR>
counter these threats, especially as a very high percentage of the threat 
<BR>
factor comes from state-engendered conflict to begin with.
<BR>
<P>Thus, survival itself will likely ultimately hinge upon replacing the 
<BR>
monopoly coercive state with something better.  Maybe the first SI will 
<BR>
instantly - from our perspective - solve this.  Meanwhile, not counting on 
<BR>
that, I suggest we look for ways to leverage the information revolution to 
<BR>
provide services here and now that capitalize on the state's fundamental 
<BR>
weaknesses - such as my proposed social contract.
