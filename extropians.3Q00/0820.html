This is a great idea Zeb. Better yet, have little groups of merry pranksters
<BR>
plant THC grass on the lawns of all town leaders, policemen, priests, schools,
<BR>
etc in as many communities across the country. Failure to raid and seize the
<BR>
property of these people will cause all drug seizures and raids be dismissed as
<BR>
cases of capricious enforcement.

<EM>&gt; I was just thinking that many of the people who hate GM food and transgenic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animals, particularly the most extreme eco-terrorist ones, somehow have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deluded themselves into thinking that genetic engineering is a tool of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oppression - that the widespread use of GM will result in them not being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to do what they want to do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A way to counter this is ro provide them with a case where GM will allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them a greater amount of freedom then they already have. I've thought of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way to do this which I think is within current or nearly-current technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I came up with this idea several years ago but just realized it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propogandistic value today: genetically engineer a strain of grass (common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lawn grass) which produces THC, and other chemicals found in marijuana.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Immediately, many of the people (from the left side of the anti-GM spectrum)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who are now protesting GM food suddenly can grow their favorite drug, right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in their front lawn, without arousing detection. The argument against hemp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that it will make it easier to grow marijuana - the argument applies here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well, to a much higher degree.. everyone has a lawn. How easy would it be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to select a corner of it specifically for GM grass, nobody would ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect - prohibition would completely crumble. Could this be done? Is it as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy as inserting a single gene as has already been done in hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other cases?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This would probably backfire if done in isolation without anything else to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appease the religious right wing &quot;you're playing god!&quot; aspect as well.
