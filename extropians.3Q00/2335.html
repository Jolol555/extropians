<EM>&gt; ***BTW, I strongly encourage everyone on this list to check out Mojo Nation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Software as soon as possible.   <A HREF="http://www.mojonation.net/">http://www.mojonation.net/</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, this is a fascinating and promising effort.  I hope to see more
<BR>
technical details on the algorithms used in order to judge how well they
<BR>
can deliver on their potential, but in many ways it looks like Freenet as
<BR>
designed by Galt's Gulch (Ayn Rand's fictional hypercapitalist community).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And finally please check out Mojo Nation.  <A HREF="http://www.mojonation.net/">http://www.mojonation.net/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This software has the potential of creating the worlds first decentralize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; online currency - can we say anonymous e-cash?  Give Mojo Nation file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swapping a few years, and mojo bucks could become more valuable the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollars.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not only the e-cash angle, I am even more interested in the proposal for
<BR>
a decentralized reputation system.  People can endorse each other and
<BR>
operate servers to publish reputation ratings.  Here is a description
<BR>
from some of their technical documentation:
<BR>
<P>: Each agent in the system will maintain its own local database of
<BR>
: reputations, including a list of other agents with which it has
<BR>
: communicated and information about these conversations. For example,
<BR>
: if there was a failure sending a message within the system, or if one
<BR>
: agent tried to cheat another by not delivering information, the parties
<BR>
: should neither run a fraud detection protocol nor consult a third party
<BR>
: for resolution. Instead, the agent will lessen the local reputation of
<BR>
: the other, and complete the desired transaction with a different agent.
<BR>
<P>This is simple and clean - no fraud resolution protocol; if things don't
<BR>
work out you publish an indictment of the other person, which will
<BR>
slightly damage his reputation.  If he gets a lot of such criticism,
<BR>
his &quot;credit rating&quot; will drop.  All done in a decentralized way.
<BR>
