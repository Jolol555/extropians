<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Could you please rephrase this? If you mean that Super-AI would make human

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; of resistance to any such project.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &lt;rephrase mode&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; AI/SI/TS will accomplish (&quot;in terms which laymen can understand&quot;) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obsolescence of lay persons, and in fact it has already made them obsolete due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to their inability to understand the process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &lt;/rephrase mode&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand much about the process behind my calculator but I
<BR>
understand the product.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Lay persons will not become a major source of resistance to this project because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lay persons, for the most part, don't believe that machines can become truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intelligent. (Ask the lay person on the street if you doubt this.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Lay persons generally scoff at the idea of Artificial Life. They won't believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it until they see it happen. By then, it will be too late to put the genie back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the bottle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't recommend that extropians try to persuade the general public that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Artificial Life is probable in our lifetime, because as long as they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believe it's possible, they won't interfere with the project. What they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know can't hurt us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, let us keep the masses ignorant heh?  Where have we heard that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before? So, we can get to the great and wondrous technological Advent if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only the unwashed never get wind of it?  This is a two-edged sword. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When the masses hear about it they will hear through voices of alarm and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most-likely uninformed voices calling for our heads and entrails as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traitors to all humanity.  Think about it.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it depends on how you approach the public. Nobody is threatened by
<BR>
the $5 calculator. Everyone thinks it is a useful invention. However, it
<BR>
surpasses &quot;human equivalency&quot; with respect to arithmetic ability (which is
<BR>
sometimes in measuring IQ). I don't think the general public is
<BR>
threatened by chess playing machines which surpass human equivalency
<BR>
although some human experts are. If you explain that &quot;transhuman&quot; AI as
<BR>
it is called on the Singularity web site in such terms I expect most
<BR>
people will see it as a positive contribution to socially beneficial
<BR>
inventions. Actually I think it is &quot;intellectual workers&quot; who will be most
<BR>
threatened. The general public would want to know how you propose to keep
<BR>
it under control if it has mobility and autonomy and genetic algorithms.
