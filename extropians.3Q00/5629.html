<P>False.  Pure capitalism is defined by free trade, voluntary trade among
<BR>
free agents.  That has everything to do with an ethics of individual
<BR>
rights and with democracy.  It is democracy in action within the
<BR>
marketplace of goods, services and labor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Capitalists will exploit repression as easily democracy. Under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some circumstances capitalists have backed dictators, and under other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances &quot;democrats.&quot; All they care about is their ability to generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and keep profit. Thats fine in its place, i.e. a strong liberal and social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democracy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Assumptions that capitalist sare only concerned with profits and that
<BR>
there is no underlying justice or justification behind the system are
<BR>
not proved simply by assuming such assumptions are a fact.  Much of what
<BR>
is called &quot;capitalism&quot; is actually fascism.  An organization enslaving
<BR>
people for the benefit of its rulers is NOT capitalism.  State sponsored
<BR>
organizations overruling individual freedom to choose is not capitalism.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It appears from the debate on this list that there are a growing number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanists hip to the fact that the defense of liberal democracy, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all members of the list benefit from, requires more than obeisance to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fantasy model of anarcho-capitalism. If we are to avoid profound social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflict in the coming decades there must be a vision of transhuman liberal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and social democracy, one that can allow and protect the co-existence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans 1.0 and post-humans. The hegemony of anacho-capitalism in transhuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circles just makes more likely that the coming changes will exacerbate gaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between rich and poor, and generate conflicts between the forces of reaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and those of progress.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on what is meant.  Many users of the term &quot;social democracy&quot;
<BR>
are talking about something utterly abhorrent and dangerous.  Gaps as
<BR>
such are not a problem and the elimination of such gaps is a
<BR>
superstitious fantasy goal.  What is important for human well being is a
<BR>
system where each individual's best potentials can be maximized and
<BR>
where each benefits as much as possible from the abilities of one
<BR>
another.  It is not necessary that everyone is absolutely equal for this
<BR>
to occur.  The distribution of traits  and abilities and
<BR>
motivation/energy/dedication  is simply not equal.
