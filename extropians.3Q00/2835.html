However in fascist Italy in 1934 Enrico Fermi performed almost the exact
<BR>
same experiment that Hahn and Strassman did in 1939, and although he
<BR>
must have produced fission, for some reason he did not detect it. This was
<BR>
very uncharacteristic of Fermi, not only was he a superb theoretician he was
<BR>
probably the best experimental physicist of his age, the man made very
<BR>
few mistakes. Years later Fermi said he was very glad he did make a mistake
<BR>
this time, if the Axis powers had started to make a bomb in 1934 the world
<BR>
would be in a new dark age today. Fermi also had personal reasons for doing
<BR>
less than his best, his wife was Jewish.
<BR>
<P><P>Exactly. Noddack (1934) first suggested the uranium fission.
<BR>
Hahn and Meittner, Joliot, etc. found nothing. Edoardo Amaldi and
<BR>
Emilio Segré (and also Enrico Fermi) performed their experiments in Rome,
<BR>
during 1934 and 1936, with neutrons. Segré said they did not understand
<BR>
those results because that search (trans-uranium elements)
<BR>
was extremely chaotic (the s.c. multi-radioactivity).
<BR>
Also Abelson (1938) at Berkeley did not realize that one of his X-rays
<BR>
pictures
<BR>
showed clearly the fission. Then Hahn and Strassman during the same year....
<BR>
<P>Bohr was very interested in that field. In Los Alamos Bohr said
<BR>
he had a meeting (in London) with W. Churchill about the possibility of
<BR>
making the A-bomb in G.B. But his speech was obscure ... and Churchill
<BR>
was in a great hurry.
<BR>
<P>Fermi (Segrè and many many others) worked in Los Alamos
<BR>
hoping to throw their bomb exactly on Hitler's head, in Berlin.
