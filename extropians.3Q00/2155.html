<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; suggested to send someone a buck if you like their site.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned some months ago a guy who was an expert in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmissions, who wrote and posted articles thereon, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said he would continue to do so as long as he got enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donations in the mail to make it worth his time.  I havent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; checked to see if he is still there.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>OK I checked, and I cannot find him.  He might still be
<BR>
there somewhere, but as it turns out one can query a
<BR>
search engine these days on ford + transmission + truck
<BR>
for instance and have many of the hits be ads for porno sites
<BR>
with a long list of decoy words up front.
<BR>
<P>What I am looking for is a *new* way to pay the
<BR>
artists, musicians, writers, software developers, etc,
<BR>
that does not depend on a middleman marketer who
<BR>
ends up devouring a disproportionate share of the
<BR>
profit.  I am looking for a way the writer can go
<BR>
directly to the reading public, and let them decide
<BR>
if a work is worth reading or buying.  The canonical
<BR>
example is Kerouac's On The Road.  Many publishers
<BR>
did not want it, finally it was hailed as perhaps the
<BR>
best American novel of the 1950s.  Jack should be
<BR>
given some means of letting the public be the jury,
<BR>
not the publisher, and should be paid by the public,
<BR>
not at the whim of a middleman.
<BR>
<P>Im open to suggestion here.  I can assure you however,
<BR>
if we depend only on writers who are self motivated,
<BR>
we will end up with a body of literature which is as
<BR>
free of content as it is cost.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, I do suggest a totally *new* system, for
<BR>
we are coming to realize more every day that presenting
<BR>
information as ink on dead trees is itself a crippleware
<BR>
version of that information.  Eliezer's comment was
<BR>
quite appropriate: this is not information, it is a *picture* of
<BR>
information.
<BR>
<P>The fires in the library at Alexandria burn brightly.  Any
<BR>
information that is not currently going into ASCII files
<BR>
that can somehow be archived and referenced, might
<BR>
as well be flaming with the ancient Greek scrolls.  I suspect
<BR>
today we would find ever fewer doing what I used to do
<BR>
in high school and college: wandering the library arbitrarily
<BR>
devouring information found in dusty old books.  Today
<BR>
it must be in electronic form, for eventually the singularity
<BR>
will have informational input demands that cannot be met
<BR>
using woodpulp.
<BR>
<P>However, we must *still* figure out some way to reward
<BR>
those who produce real content, anything other than porno
<BR>
spam and jesus memes.  Otherwise the post singularity
<BR>
AI may well conclude that humanity and all its work is
<BR>
really not worth preserving.  I think we can do it, I just
<BR>
do not know how.  spike
