<P><EM>&gt; In our present legal (and moral) system, a newborn baby cannot be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even though as Barbara accurately point out it represents a far 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long-term drain on the mother's resources than the fetus.  However 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason is that there is an escape clause: anyone can give up a baby.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No one is forced to keep a child.
</EM><BR>
<P>Turning the child over to someone else was one of the options I had in
<BR>
mind when I wrote that a mother (should? could?) have the right to
<BR>
dispose of her newly born baby.  Because I was including infanticide as
<BR>
an option and went on to say that death is in some cases preferable to
<BR>
life,  the other options were overlooked.  (dispose = to put in place; to
<BR>
settle a matter; to transfer to the control of another / Webser's 9th
<BR>
Collegiate Dictionary)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;In fact, for a child who isn't adopted by caring adults, life can be
<BR>
grim whether the child is put into an institution or kept by the mother. 
<BR>
I personally know a child whose ribs were broken by his mother during the
<BR>
first month of his life. This and the other abuses he suffered left him
<BR>
emotionally scarred, and by the time the mother decided she didn't want
<BR>
to keep him, he was unadoptable.  And this kid's white.  For the
<BR>
non-white kids, especially if they have physical or mental abnormalities,
<BR>
&nbsp;the idea of adoption is more like a bad joke.  
<BR>
<P>If a mother chooses not to bear a child it would be better to kill the
<BR>
fetus early on, I agree, if for no other reason than to spare the mother
<BR>
the additional weeks of carrying it.  Better still to kill it when it's
<BR>
still in the embryonic stage.  But there are times--and I know this from
<BR>
personal observation--when  a woman has no idea she's pregnant until the
<BR>
fetus is pretty large. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The point I was trying to make by bringing up the idea of killing a
<BR>
newly born baby is that the classification of human fetuses/babies
<BR>
according to length of time from conception is arbitrary.  A tiny fetus
<BR>
that could fit in the palm of your hand can, at great expense, be brought
<BR>
to term in an incubator.  From what I've read, such fetuses are sometimes
<BR>
still alive when they come out of the mother's womb during an abortion,
<BR>
as are larger fetuses on accasion.  Therefore infanticide IS being
<BR>
practiced. People just pretend that it's not, because the idea isn't
<BR>
acceptable to them.   
<BR>
<P>I've seen arguments about whether or not fetuses can feel anything.  Of
<BR>
course they can feel.  I've dealt with non-human animals (cats, lambs,
<BR>
hamsters, rabbits)  who've had spontaneous abortions, and also chickens
<BR>
whose eggs I've opened, thinking they were dead; and the immature animals
<BR>
that come out can obviously feel--what they feel I don't know for sure,
<BR>
but the way they writhe around indicates that it's not pleasant.  Why
<BR>
pretend they can't feel?  (I've read literature intended to help women
<BR>
reach a decision on whether or not to get an abortion, and it stated that
<BR>
a fetus cannot feel)
<BR>
<P>I believe that more rational decisions can be reached if reality is
<BR>
respected and plain words are used in place of euphemisms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Once that becomes possible, it might be that society will change the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laws to treat fetuses the same as babies.  You can have an abortion 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time you want, but you must do it non-destructively.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, these are the sorts of questions I wanted to look at.  
<BR>
<P>The unwanted 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fetus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be transfered to another womb, perhaps artificial.  In effect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are giving it up for adoption.  Doing abortions in the present way 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be considered murder, and a pregnant woman failing to guard the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of her fetus would be child abuse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could this be a compromise on the abortion issue acceptable to many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it might well be acceptable to many people;  and it would make
<BR>
sense if there were unlimited resources so that the children who were
<BR>
born in this manner could be well cared for. 
<BR>
<P>Here are some questions that occur to me:  would the parents give up all
<BR>
parental rights to a child who was turned over to someone else to bring
<BR>
to term in an artificial womb?  What if the mother wanted to give the
<BR>
fetus up but the father wanted to keep the child?  What would the
<BR>
father's rights be?  Would parents be able to sell the rights to their
<BR>
fetus?  How would a law like this, which treated all embryos as humans,
<BR>
effect cloned humans or part-humans?   
<BR>
<P>Another option that has recently been mentioned on the list would be to
<BR>
reversibly sterilize everyone (or conceivably one could sterilize only
<BR>
all the males or only all the females)  so that a positive decision has
<BR>
to be made before a preganancy occurs. 
<BR>
<P>(in order to avoid the bad feeling that comes with assuming that such
<BR>
sterilization would take place via some form of government, maybe we
<BR>
could suppose for purposes of this discussion, that we're talking about
<BR>
people who voluntarily choose to become members of the group for which
<BR>
these rules would apply)
<BR>
<P>This actually sounds like the best option to me.  If I were shopping
<BR>
around for a group to join, I'd probably pick the one that went with mass
<BR>
sterization with reversal under some circumstances, possibly on demand by
<BR>
the person who wished to become pregnant.
<BR>
<P>Here's an interesting thought that occurs to me in connection with
<BR>
sterilization.  What if a husband wishes to procreate but his wife
<BR>
doesn't?  If you were making up the rules for the group you're part of,
<BR>
would you make a rule that  the man should be able to force the woman to
<BR>
undergo reversal of sterilization?  I think most people would say no. 
<BR>
And yet, I think more people would answer yes to the question of whether
<BR>
or not a woman needs the consent of her husband in order to get an
<BR>
abortion (assuming present day technology and social conditions).  What's
<BR>
the relevant difference between these 2 situations? (I myself would
<BR>
choose complete freedom of contract between the woman or the man, so that
<BR>
each person could make their own decision)
