<EM>&gt; That superluminal light propagation (Princeton experiment) on Nature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/fow/">http://www.nature.com/nature/fow/</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>It's actually worse than superluminal; the pulse literally arrives before
<BR>
it is sent (in their interpretation of events).
<BR>
<P>For those who can't read the article, I have made a temporary copy of
<BR>
the most important graph at <A HREF="http://www.finney.org/~hal/nature_ftl.jpg">http://www.finney.org/~hal/nature_ftl.jpg</A>.
<BR>
<P>It shows two waveforms, a solid one labelled A, and a dashed one
<BR>
labelled B.  They are almost superimposed, with B a little bit ahead of A.
<BR>
<P>These are the measurements of the shape of the wave coming out of the
<BR>
chamber, in two different cases.  A is when the laser is tuned to a
<BR>
frequency which will not be affected by the gas in the chamber.  In that
<BR>
case it travels at the speed of light.  B is when the laser is tuned to
<BR>
the frequency which should be accelerated by the gas.  We see that B
<BR>
is earlier than A, by about 62 ns.
<BR>
<P>The chamber is only 6 cm long, which takes about 0.2 ns to traverse,
<BR>
so if taken literally this measurement implies that the pulse began
<BR>
leaving the chamber about 62 nanoseconds before it began arriving.
<BR>
Given that this is enough time to travel six feet, which is likely to
<BR>
be shorter than the optical path for the whole experiment, it means that
<BR>
the pulse arrives at the detector before it is sent.  (Note though that
<BR>
the pulse itself takes several microseconds, so what it really means is
<BR>
that the pulse recorded at the detector &quot;leads&quot; the state of the pulse
<BR>
as it is being emitted from the laser.)
<BR>
<P>I think it's clear that this could not actually have happened; nothing
<BR>
left the chamber until something entered it.  At the very beginning of
<BR>
the pulse, the first faint stirrings of the oncoming electromagnetic
<BR>
winds triggered the chamber to emit a matching pulse which was 62 ns
<BR>
ahead in time of the original pulse.
<BR>
<P>If this is true, it should be possible to see the effect at the very
<BR>
beginning of the pulse; the 62 ns lead time should not be present at
<BR>
sufficiently early points.  There are insets in the graph above showing
<BR>
enlargements of data near the beginning and ending of the pulse, and
<BR>
no such phenomenon is evident.  However I can explain this simply by
<BR>
postulating that they did not look close enough to the beginning of
<BR>
the pulse.  If they were able to look at that data sufficiently closely,
<BR>
I am confident that they would see the effect I am describing, which
<BR>
would contradict their interpretation of backwards-in-time transmission.
