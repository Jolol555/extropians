</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, sounds like an oversimplification, but lets move on to some
<BR>
interesting comments you have made.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Several days ago someone (was it you, Spike?) said they'd really liked the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; book and wanted to discuss it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The reviews that were posted here were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very...um, scholarly-like.  You know what I mean?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, just the opposite.  I posted the fact that I have little formal training
<BR>
in evolution, and that my understanding of it is pretty much limited to
<BR>
reading nine volumes of Steven Jay Gould.  I am beginning to
<BR>
realize he may have been a misguided choice of teachers in this field.
<BR>
Good writer tho.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I found the parts of the book I read quite entertaining.  I laughed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; laughed, until I was afraid I was bothering the other people who were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sitting around reading.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?  I find the laughter of women to be the most pleasant sound
<BR>
I can imagine.  Thats why I enjoy visiting the nude beach.  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (I found G. Miller to be quite attractive, by the way;
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too, hes a babe.
<BR>
[kidding, bygones, Im straight.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I never can resist a man who makes me think and laugh at the same time).
</EM><BR>
<P>No way, Bonnie, thats impossible, cant be done.  Just try to do an integral
<BR>
while you are laughing, or even multiply two digit numbers in your
<BR>
head.  You wont get there, you'll get the wrong answer.  If you stop
<BR>
your yukkadooing for a minute then you might solve it, but I find it
<BR>
is impossible to think and laugh at the same time.  You cant laugh
<BR>
yourself to sleep either, Ive tried that.  Each harrharhar wakes you
<BR>
back up.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but the fact is that while I adore men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as friends and lovers, I prefer women as house-mates.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja me too.  WAIT!  I mean... I prefer a woman as a housemate!  I dont
<BR>
adore men.  Friends, fine, but THATS ALL!  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For one thing, they don't try to own me. But the owning thing may be cultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard-wired.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nah, you are just seeing the wrong kinda man.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, goofing aside, and getting to the Mating Mind book.
<BR>
Let us specifically talk about mooses for a minute, to try to
<BR>
escape a collection of preconceived notions.
<BR>
<P>So.  Mooses.  Males with antlers, females without.  Now
<BR>
think evolution, and Moose precursors where antlers were
<BR>
just beginning to develop.  The femooses are neutral to
<BR>
them at first, but the antlers turn out to be good for
<BR>
fighting and the moose with the bigger antlers wins.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, even if the femooses dont care, over time
<BR>
the big antlered males win the fights.  The fight winners
<BR>
get a big shot of testosterone, where the losers get a
<BR>
shot of anti-testosterone.  {Guys, you know what Im
<BR>
talking about here}.  So even if the femooses are
<BR>
indifferent to who won the fight, the winner wants
<BR>
to mate, perhaps several times, whereas the loser
<BR>
isnt really in the mood too much.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, the group of femooses still must *accept* the big
<BR>
antlered fight winner, right?  The femooses that prefer the
<BR>
small antlered loser and go off with him will be less likely
<BR>
to be mounted, since he isnt in the mood, whereas those
<BR>
who prefer the big antlered winner will spend the evening
<BR>
with a horny moose. Result: Mr. Big Antlers sires more...meese.
<BR>
<P>They take after their mother, and soon you have a population
<BR>
of mooses that inherently prefer big antlers, and as time
<BR>
goes by the population keep selecting the big antlered
<BR>
males, *even after they are no longer an advantage in
<BR>
a fight*, after they are too big and heavy to use for fighting.
<BR>
<P>Eventually the antlers get so damn big and heavy they
<BR>
work *against* survival.  The femooses remember,
<BR>
must support the weight of Mr. Big Antlers when he
<BR>
mounts her, and if they are TOO BIG, she cannot
<BR>
support his weight.
<BR>
<P>The point of all this is:  sex selection and survival
<BR>
selection are two *different things* and in fact can
<BR>
sometimes pull in different directions.  That particular
<BR>
species of moose I used went extinct.
<BR>
<P>Whaddya think?  Laugh first, then think.  spike
