From: &quot;Mike Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20GUNS:%20Why%20here?&In-Reply-To=&lt;005f01c025a9$3bd6af80$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Or have I misinterpreted you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very much so, though I think its more a matter of your comprehension.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>He (Hal) is not misinterpreting you-- he's simply drawing a different
<BR>
conclusion from the agreed upon premise: if you intend to carry a weapon,
<BR>
you should be prepared to kill another human being.
<BR>
<P>The question he's raising is simple: does the preparation necessary to kill
<BR>
another human being, alter one's attitude towards humans in general-- and if
<BR>
so, are there negative side effects to such preparation that might interfere
<BR>
with one's attitude towards people in general?
<BR>
<P>I think the answer is clearly yes, but the significance of any such
<BR>
alteration must be judged on a case by case basis.  How significantly does
<BR>
possession of, and willingness to use, a firearm reduce your net chance of
<BR>
death, from all possible causes?  Do you 'care' if your attitude towards
<BR>
people is altered?
<BR>
<P><P>I'm going to quote a few passages from you Mike:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They are sick people that cannot be reasoned with,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot be reconciled with, who have no pity, no mercy, no compassion. If
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; don't value your life, then they obviously don't value their own.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is, to my mind, an example of what Hal is talking about.  Is it true,
<BR>
in actuality, that all people you encounter with whom you are required to
<BR>
employ deadly force (robber, thug, murderer, etc, you can make your own
<BR>
list) -cannot- be reasoned with, -cannot- be reconciled with, have -no-
<BR>
pity, mercy or compassion and fail to value their own lives?
<BR>
<P>Of course not.  They are, in fact, complex human beings, driven by unseen
<BR>
motives, and often susceptible to all sorts of persuasion.
<BR>
<P>Your decision to treat them as described above is, in fact, part of your
<BR>
mindset-- something I suspect makes you more effective in just such a
<BR>
situation.
<BR>
<P>So we're clear here, I actually don't mind that-- I appreciate that you have
<BR>
made a decision to empower yourself over those who might seek to harm you,
<BR>
and I respect that.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; People who are 'trusting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open, and accepting of the human limitations and weaknesses' of murderers
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; no longer people (as far as the murderer is concerned, they are just prey,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; then they are dead
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, you are stripping someone of their humanity-- which is the exact
<BR>
&quot;distancing and depersonalizing,&quot; to which Hal was referring.
<BR>
<P>Again, I'm not really judging this attitude-- but I don't think it's wrong
<BR>
to consider the consequences of your mindset-- and to ask whether, on an
<BR>
individual level, those consequences are acceptable.
<BR>
<P>My actual chance of losing my life in a violent confrontation that could
<BR>
have otherwise been prevented had I been armed and prepared to use deadly
<BR>
force is quite slim-- but if I lived elsewhere, or had a different
<BR>
occupation, or had family members in situations of realistic harm, I would
<BR>
be prepared to take the necessary steps to protect our lives/interests.
<BR>
<P>It would not make me happy to have to prepare to kill someone else, however.
<BR>
There would be real consequences to such a decision.
<BR>
