</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The thing is is that the conditions set forth in Appendix B are not very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different from the agreements that all NATO member nations have to sign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to host NATO troops.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FRY/Serbia is not a NATO member.  NATO is a defensive alliance.  Originally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was only intended to last about a decade, and then was mainly as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counter to potential Soviet invasion of Western Europe.  Yugoslavia was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never a member of this alliance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet it is surrounded by NATO members, who have wound up paying the cost
<BR>
of the refugee problem created by Serbia's racist policies. Because of
<BR>
this unconsented imposition of externalities, Serbia brought NATO on
<BR>
itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The differences being there specifically because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Serbia was, in fact, an agressor nation in opposition to NATO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An aggressor nation is generally defined as one that attacks other nations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since Kosovo was (and de jure still is) part of FRY, this claim falls flat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, before the war began, it's still arguable whether the aggression was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than counter-terrorist operations.  (Arguable, though not certain.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Serbia had, at that point, established a consistent record of backing,
<BR>
supporting, and committing genocide, ethnic cleansing, and all around
<BR>
general anti-democratic gestapo tactics in violation even of its own
<BR>
laws. While it is arguable that the KLA received backing from underworld
<BR>
figures in Albania, that is really irrelevant. The ethnic Albanians
<BR>
raised and living in Kosovo had been under an organized campaign of
<BR>
prejudice, segregation, oppression and persecution ever since Milosevic
<BR>
took power in the 80's and made his famous speech in Kosovo that he
<BR>
would take back Kosovo for the Serbians. Given such a high level of
<BR>
approval for anti-albanian activities by serbs in kosovo, it is only
<BR>
natural that albanians would turn to their countrymen for support
<BR>
against such persecution. Terrorists are only terrorists to those who
<BR>
wish to wipe them out and those who buy into the propaganda of the
<BR>
opressors. As has been learned in Ireland, Isreal, and elsewhere, the
<BR>
easiest and least bloody way to deal with terrorists is to try to remove
<BR>
the reasons why terrorists engender support. Now, terrorists are called
<BR>
terrorist because they attack and engeder fear in a civilian population.
<BR>
The KLA never attacked civilians prior to the NATO action, they focused
<BR>
only on government police, soldiers, and politicians. These are not acts
<BR>
of terrorists, but of guerrillas fighting an insurgency war. The only
<BR>
people who committed terrorist acts against civilians in Kosovo were the
<BR>
Serbs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The same applies to Kosovar Albanians, the KLA, and even Albania.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; given the opportunity to cooperate prior to the bombing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The cooperation was limited to accepting the agreement or being bombed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's not much more than pure coercion.  Notably, neither the Kosovar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Albanians nor the FRY had input into the drafting of the agreement.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was &quot;take it or leave it&quot; diplomacy.  (You might argue that the Serbian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government deserves no better, but the cost of such a stance is not only the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort spent bombing, but also innocents being killed, both Serbian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Albanian, etc.  Also, one might ask, did American negotiators really want an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreement all sides could agree to that would protect Kosovar Albanians AND
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address Serbian concerns about the KLA or was the goal to push Serbia into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corner then bomb?)
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a good question to ask, especially its being so concurrent with
<BR>
the scandals that Clinton was going through at the time. However, it is
<BR>
my opinion that while Clinton definitely had an interest in deflecting
<BR>
attention away from himself, there was a just and real reason to go into
<BR>
Kosovo. If I were a NATO peacekeeper, I can tell you I would not go in
<BR>
unless I had AT LEAST the sort of conditions set forth in the
<BR>
Ramboulliet agreement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is markedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different from the options Serbia gave the other republics when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; declared indiependence. Serbia just started bombing and shooting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; non-serbians by the thousands.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, some of this is expected behavior.  Secessions on the whole are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tolerated by whatever they are seceding from.  Note the cases of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American Colonies seceding from Great Britain, the CSA seceding from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; USA, East Timor seceding from Indonesia, Chechnya seceding from Russia, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Kurds attempting to seceded from Turkey, Iraq, and Iran.  In all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these cases, violent methods were used to suppress the rebellions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This does not make such suppression good or right, but it's considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural behavior for nation states.  Ones that can't or won't do that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generally, do not continue to exist for long.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is clearely unsupportable in the current day, given the excellent
<BR>
example of Czhechoslovakia breaking up quite peacefully into Slovakia
<BR>
and the Czhech Republic. The Soviet Union also broke up rather
<BR>
peacefully, surprise surprise. I personally expected that to be a
<BR>
bloodbath. Then you've also got Canada going through the process of
<BR>
breaking off Nunavut at the present moment, with scarcely a ripple that
<BR>
you have not heard anything about it in the news in months, and most of
<BR>
the rest of english speaking Canada secretly wishes that Quebec would go
<BR>
ahead and secede, just so they can get that damn welfare case off their
<BR>
backs. You've also got Britain slowly going through the motions of
<BR>
breaking up so peacefully and politely hardly anyone has a bad thing to
<BR>
say about it. The Scots and Welsh are so  damn happy to have their own
<BR>
parliaments now they sure as hell can't say anything bad about London.
<BR>
Hell, the Scots got their stone back too.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You really don't have much to stand on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here trying to make Milosevic look like the victim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not trying to make Milosevic or the Serb government look like victims
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here.  My goal is merely to give more evidence in this discussion.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pro-Serb or pro-Milosevic.  At the same time, I do think the US and NATO got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involved in a basically counterproductive war where many innocents suffered.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many more Albanians and Serbians died during the war.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think you can make any sort of representations over how many
<BR>
died versus how many WOULD HAVE DIED if Milosevic and his Tigers had
<BR>
been allowed a free reign to commit widespread genocide across Kosovo. I
<BR>
personally think that despite the number who died, more would have died
<BR>
if we had not gone in, and those that woud have died would have all been
<BR>
Albanians, while at least this way the Serbian civilians that have
<BR>
approved all this bullshit have finally had to pay some price for their
<BR>
bigotry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think NATO member populations were propagandized into accepting the war.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surely, Milosevic and the Serbian government are not nice, good, just, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But, at the same time, there are much worse problems in the world (Turkish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treatment of Kurds being perhaps the most glaring one, since Turkey is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NATO member and a US client state) and I feel this was more Monica's War
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than anything else.
</EM><BR>
<P>Turkish repression of Kurds is likely to remain on the back burner until
<BR>
the problems of Isreal/Palestine and Iraq are resolved. The Turkish
<BR>
people are getting more and more fundamentalist, and it may become more
<BR>
of a problem in the next several years, however I am hoping that the
<BR>
continuing moderation of Iran will decrease the support for
<BR>
fundamentalist groups around the arab world.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But to be more constructive here: how would Extropians in general deal with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such problems?  One would hope our bright technological future would make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethnic rivalries less a problem, yet the 1990s seemed like a time when both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology progressed and ethnic rivalries and even wars increased.
</EM><BR>
<P>Governments and multinational corps have used advancing technologies to
<BR>
try to make the world a smaller place. They need to realize that people
<BR>
suffer from the same psychological pressures you see in the rat
<BR>
experiment, and when there is the perception that people are closer
<BR>
together and there is pressure for conformity, there will be increased
<BR>
pressure by individuals to push people farther apart and be unique. We
<BR>
all have to have our own space, our comfort zone. We are not domestic
<BR>
animals.
