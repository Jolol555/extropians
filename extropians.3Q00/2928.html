<EM>&gt;Dear Franklin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A great deal of discussion of this topic has happened on this list over the
</EM><BR>
last four years.  If you
<BR>
<EM>&gt;start looking around in the archives at <A HREF="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I'm all for &quot;giving the devil his due&quot; but I couldn't use the search
<BR>
engine on Lucifer's web site. My regards to the Old Boy anyway.
<BR>
<P>you can follow many
<BR>
<EM>&gt;ineffable and qualiatative threads.  Unfortunately, the threads are not
</EM><BR>
indexed very well, so you are
<BR>
<EM>&gt;on your own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No one understands, yet, exactly what is going on at the quantum level.  We
</EM><BR>
have plenty of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;experimental data that allow us to infer some rules, and we have made the
</EM><BR>
&quot;Standard Model&quot; which has
<BR>
<EM>&gt;worked well for the last 20 years.  As we make models that have predictive
</EM><BR>
power, we gain the ability
<BR>
<EM>&gt;to use quantum properties to make devices.  Whatever is happening at the
</EM><BR>
tiny scale of quantum
<BR>
<EM>&gt;mechanics, is happening in the physical universe, it is just that at the
</EM><BR>
scale of our daily lives the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;physical universe looks much, much, simpler than it really is.  It turns
</EM><BR>
out that reality is stranger
<BR>
<EM>&gt;(and richer) than metaphysics, so who needs metaphysics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-Ken
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ahhh Grasshopper:
<BR>
Dualist and Monist-subjectivist philosophies constitute metaphysics IMO. I
<BR>
also think we can substitute &quot;general scientific theories&quot; for these names,
<BR>
going by Runes Dictionary of Philosophy and its definition of philosophy as
<BR>
&quot;the most general science&quot;.
<BR>
So these two theories posit that in theory one can hold numbers and their
<BR>
calculations in mind by &quot;mentalist&quot; methods, without recourse to physical
<BR>
computing. I am then the thinker and not the thought and always will be so.
<BR>
A thought can be defined physically as is done in AI. The thinker is
<BR>
metaphysical and always has the capacity to form thoughts at a level higher
<BR>
than the physical. You might call that a &quot;creative&quot; power.
<BR>
And quoting Genesis, man was FORMED from the dust of the earth like the
<BR>
animals but CREATED in God's image and likeness. Watson's seminal 1913 ms in
<BR>
&quot;Psych Review&quot; put an end to MENTALISM they said but isn't it ironic that
<BR>
psychologists who reject mentalism still call that which is assessed by IQ
<BR>
testing and related abilities, &quot;MENTAL Ability&quot;? So there is thinking and
<BR>
meta-thinking; intelligence and meta-intelligence. And maybe the
<BR>
Grasshoppers of Quantum Mechanics are catching up now. And as for me? I
<BR>
dream of turning BC into &quot;Happy Honda Land&quot; by setting up a Honda Dealership
<BR>
which will sell P3's and beyond with quantum robotic controllers.
<BR>
If Hameroff is right I already have a quantum controller on my shoulders.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Quantum mechanic
<BR>
My Honda is erratic
<BR>
I'll show you the schematic.&quot;
