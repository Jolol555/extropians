Krugmann seems off-base in this 1996 article. In the 4 years since it was 
<BR>
published the &quot;information economy&quot; has taken off, rather then taken a 
<BR>
beating. He did seem prescient regarding the failure of dot.coms and the 
<BR>
alledged shortage of information workers (according to MicroSoft and Oracle) 
<BR>
in order to get more foreign workers in at &quot;low-ball&quot; salaries.  Yet, if his 
<BR>
people to people economy is so hot, why aren't people leaving high school and 
<BR>
leaping into these positions? I disagree with Krugmann's notion that the 
<BR>
economic down-sizing of the early 1990's was the first one that affected the 
<BR>
white collar worker, as I recall that every recession since 1957 has done 
<BR>
this, not merely factory workers. Finally Krugmann chose to ignore the impact 
<BR>
of technology, all technology, not just computers.

<P>&lt;&lt; Thanks for that link, Robin. A quick skim brings up some points that look 
<BR>
&nbsp;sound and some that look dubious. I'll have to read it thoroughly later. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Since I mentioned a while back that it seemed to me that Krugman, good as 
<BR>
&nbsp;he is on many issues, does not &quot;get&quot; the New Economy, and I did not find 
<BR>
&nbsp;time to dig up the sources of my disagreement, I will take this opportunity 
<BR>
&nbsp;to point to one link that I just came across in a pile of stuff to read:
