I'm not saying that I think the approach to the 'Napster situation' is
<BR>
ideal, but I think all of this controversy is great.  This isn't going to
<BR>
force myself or anyone I know to stop trading music or other information,
<BR>
'copyrighted' or not, via the Internet.  There's no stopping that now.  But
<BR>
what I think it will do is give more momentum to the development of
<BR>
decentralized information storage and exchange systems, and better metrics
<BR>
for automating replication, migration, and maintenance of information
<BR>
integrity within them.  I am really interested to see what kinds of systems
<BR>
and protocols emerge to support (more universal) 'nomadic data access' and
<BR>
'task mobility.' 
<BR>
<P>Y'all have thoughts on the 'ubiquitous computing environment' paradigm?
<BR>
This is being approached in different ways by different institutions, but I
<BR>
was reading DARPA's 'Ubicomp' proposal,
<BR>
( <A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations/CBD_00-45.html">http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations/CBD_00-45.html</A>  )
<BR>
(snip)
<BR>
The Ubiquitous Computing Initiative (Ubicomp) will address issues in
<BR>
providing a new computing environment in which the users' physical spaces
<BR>
become embedded with computing functionality, as the present-day computer
<BR>
disappears.    
<BR>
&nbsp;(/snip)
<BR>
<P>and pondering the potential impacts of its application, in conjunction with
<BR>
'distributed computing', on the Internet / global level, and it really got
<BR>
my gears spinning.  Is this the next step?  How far off, from there, is a
<BR>
'sentient' Internet? ;) Does the idea of living and working inside of a
<BR>
fully interactive computer (say, your house in 2020) unsettle you?  Isn't
<BR>
this in a way conducive to the emergence of a transparent society (reference
<BR>
to the MAS [mutually assured surveillance] discussion a few months ago)?  If
<BR>
your house is a node on a global, distributed computing network, and one of
<BR>
it's directives is to identify patterns in your behaviors/intentions as its
<BR>
resident in order to preemptively feed you information it thinks you will
<BR>
want, doesn't that imply that information about you is going to be 'out
<BR>
there', potentially everywhere?  Yeah, okay, encrypt it.  Encrypt
<BR>
everything!  But who/what holds your encryption keys in an environment
<BR>
designed for constant interaction to automate the 'tediosities' of your
<BR>
life, including your decisions, when everybody is actually using the same
<BR>
great, big computer?
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
