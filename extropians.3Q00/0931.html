<EM>&gt; I disagree that you need advanced nanotech to upload.  It all depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just how detailed information you need on neurons and synapses.  And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could well be worth spending billions of dollars to scan just one brain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given how much money could be made from copies of that one brain.   We didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need advanced nanotech to read the human genome -- because it was worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough to read just one genome.

<P>Here's another possibility I haven't heard discussed ...
<BR>
<P>Work on face recognition software has uncovered the fact that there are
<BR>
actually only something like 56 distinct 'eigenfaces' -- collections of
<BR>
distinctive features by which we can identify people. All of us have faces
<BR>
which contain features which are a mix of one or more eigenfaces.
<BR>
<P>Given that as a species we are fairly genetically homogeneous, what
<BR>
are the chances that there exist a bunch of 'eigenbrains' -- phenotypic
<BR>
expressions of the human genome, in neural tissue, which all of us are
<BR>
just variations on? Yes, we develop neural circuits by killing off loads
<BR>
of synapses as we age (leaving only connections that _do_ something);
<BR>
and we all have different memories, stored presumably as physiological
<BR>
adaptations in the synapses of neurones. But if the overall architecture
<BR>
is the same, it might turn out that the cost of uploading is some massive
<BR>
amount (to map the first few dozen brains), then drops by several orders
<BR>
of magnitude (for mapping only the _differences_ from the standard model).
