Ever hear of the experiment where men were shown pics of their &quot;significant 
<BR>
other&quot; and then their applicable body functions were measured showing the 
<BR>
effect on the men?  In the next experiment the men were first shown pics ( I 
<BR>
think nude but I don't think this necessarily would make a difference) of 
<BR>
very attractive women and after that were shown pics of their significant 
<BR>
others.  The body functions were measured after each picture was viewed.  Do 
<BR>
you know which group of men found their significant other to be more 
<BR>
attractive?!!!  So much for &quot;love&quot;.  Or are extropian men &quot;different&quot;?  I 
<BR>
hope so!
