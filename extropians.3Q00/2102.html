<P>&quot;If we decide we want to be able to protect something that comes out of our
<BR>
own head, then we look for ways to do so.  You claim that encryption will be
<BR>
only a minor annoyance in the future: if that's true, then we've got some
<BR>
big issues.  Being able to protect information is only going to become more
<BR>
and more important.  I wonder if the &quot;information must be free&quot; advocates
<BR>
include personal data and private communications in their manifesto?&quot;
<BR>
<P>I reply:
<BR>
<P>After putting a little bit more thought into this, I think I can amend my
<BR>
original thoughts and say that there will probably be a time when most forms
<BR>
of encryption are more or less irrelevant between now and whenever we attain
<BR>
some form of (nearly) unbeatable encryption - maybe mature quantum computing
<BR>
or something.  Obviously as well, even though normal encryption may be
<BR>
breakable, one can always go to great lengths to ensure that 'getting at'
<BR>
private information is prohibitively expensive.  I just think that most
<BR>
entertainers will find it more profitable to move to new forms of
<BR>
entertainment - eg. experienced based - rather than add layers upon layers
<BR>
of expensive encryption to their art.
<BR>
<P>As far as whether I think most private communications or personal data will
<BR>
be encrypted or not public - well, I think that in a truly digital,
<BR>
information rich world, the vast reams of existing data may make mining
<BR>
individuals' private information very expensive.  The information may very
<BR>
well be out there, and a very determined individual may be able to find it
<BR>
if one tries hard enough, but I doubt that anyone will know 'everything.'
<BR>
Is this any different from the sort of information that's available about
<BR>
most of us right now?
