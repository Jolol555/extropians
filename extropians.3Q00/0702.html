<P><EM>&gt; CAVEAT: I AM dynamically optimistic.  You might not believe that after 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading my posts, though . . .
</EM><BR>
<P>I think one can be dynamically angry too :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I spend a good deal of time in the UK and for those who haven't spent time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immersed in European media, I'll tell you it's just plain scary how far the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-technology meme has spread.  Yes, it's inconsistent -- Europeans still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; love high-tech BMWs and cell phones, while at the same time a majority of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them react with horror to each new advance in genetic science.  But the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; European media and the left of Euro-politics is leading the luddite charge, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they've built up a LOT of momentum.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. And what Waldemar calls the 'guilt-industrial complex' is very,
<BR>
very good and has a philosophical high ground in many issues. Here in
<BR>
Sweden there will be a new education for genetic councellors (people
<BR>
to help others handle genetic testing), and it turns out that both of
<BR>
main educators for the course are strongly anti-enhancement, anti
<BR>
genetic choice and actually think it would be better for people if
<BR>
genetic testing didn't exist! A bit like having catholic abortion
<BR>
councellors.
<BR>
<P>That is the kind of stuff we have to find, show to be silly or bad and
<BR>
suggest better alternatives to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  It seems what ExI should do is write a position statement on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  advantages of Biotech and GeneEng to offset the Green/AnimalRights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  position and publish it on the web site.  Then we should make sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  reporters at the major papers know how to contact us for pithy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  comments about how ill-conceived the positions of the demonstrators are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's one small step, but not NEARLY enough.  I propose a &quot;Progress 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Coalition&quot; that gets some real money behind a concerted advertising and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lobbying campaign - to do the kinds of things Tom described in his post on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this thread.  If we don't get Madison Avenue and Congressional lobbyists 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working on our side muy pronto, we're going to show up for the game with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; score already 90 to nothing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sasha had a very similar idea, and I think it would be a treasure if
<BR>
it could be implemented - if you can get people in industry, politics,
<BR>
in need of medical care or having a positive outlook on the future to
<BR>
realise they have a mutual enemy (and mutual friends), then you could
<BR>
get a strong coalition. But that cannot be just an ExI project, it
<BR>
requires us to try to connect all our most poweful connections and get
<BR>
them to network together. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here's the problem, in a nutshell: The proponents of technological progress 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are mainly scientists and technologists.  As a rule, such folks are TERRIBLE 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at public relations and broad-based memetic promotion and, apparently at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assessing the trends in such spheres.  They're good at things that by and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large don't require those kinds of skills.  That's why they do science and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology and not politics and media.  The opponents of progress, on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other hand, tend to NOT be scientists and technologists, but media figures, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;policy wonks&quot; and politicians.  In other words, the other guys have some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inherent advantages here. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly. This is a big problem the academic community has just begun
<BR>
to notice (if even that). So let's try some lateral thinking: what do
<BR>
our side have that is inherently hard for the other side to achieve?
<BR>
