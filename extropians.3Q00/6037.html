Eugene Leitl writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your reasoning is based on a slow, soft Singularity, where both the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines and humans converge, eventually resulting in an amalgamation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advancing slowly enough so that virtually everybody can follow. While
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it may happen that way, I don't think it to be likely. I would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hear some convincing arguments as to why you think I'm mistaken.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't think you're mistaken, since this thread entails nothing that can
<BR>
presently be tested. My current readings in robotics persuade me that the most
<BR>
successful engineers will build machines which can do useful things, rather than
<BR>
try to build humanoid robots, just to prove it can be done. Similarly, I don't
<BR>
find a fast technological singularity as useful as a convergence of augmented
<BR>
humans with their Mind Children. IOW, the only usefulness of a fast TS would be
<BR>
to escape or leave behind Homo sapiens (those nasty war mongers).
<BR>
<P>As you've probably found obvious, I favor the scenario of a friendly genetically
<BR>
programmed AI that will help humans deal with the TS by allowing as many of us
<BR>
as want to become cyborgs. Or perhaps I should say that I think friendly AI will
<BR>
emerge in cyborgs congruently as it happens on the Net or in laboratories. This
<BR>
doesn't constitute a convincing argument I know. Perhaps I'll work that out next
<BR>
week when I return from my next meditation retreat. Meanwhile, I'd like to hear
<BR>
some convincing arguments as to why you think an unfriendly AI (apparently the
<BR>
only kind you give credence to) can be prevented emerging.
<BR>
