<EM> &gt; Suppose we don't have a libertarian or private-law world as we move
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; forward.  Can the modern liberal democracy work in a transhuman world?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
That's a rather funny idea. To me, the predictability horizont does
<BR>
look damn opaque until actual traversal. The only things I seem to
<BR>
make out (on the truly solid basis of a few educated guesses), is
<BR>
transformation of humanity into something very strange and
<BR>
diverse. Talking about conservation of a given political system in
<BR>
this changed context makes about as much sense as discussion the
<BR>
continuing importance of the internal combustion engine in the 33rd
<BR>
century.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; How would we deal with the tremendous potential increase in diversity,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with a corresponding spread in ability levels?  Some people will augment
</EM><BR>
<P>Globalization must have it's end when travel/communication becomes
<BR>
expensive due to relativistic lag, in relation to the activity
<BR>
dynamics. This clearly defines boundaries to size of upper hierarchy
<BR>
structures and/or in absence of a global synchronizing principle
<BR>
defines the limits to the time scope of their synchronized action. As
<BR>
in Roman and Chinese empres, communication once again becomes the
<BR>
bottleneck of organisational structures.
<BR>
<P>Economy and ecology are probably based on a deeper principle --
<BR>
computational or information physics -- I'm lacking a catchy neologism 
<BR>
here. Information ecology?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; themselves to be super-intelligent and have other powers.  AIs may
</EM><BR>
<P>Some will be super-intelligent, some will be dumb as T-cells, some
<BR>
will be somewhere in between. A few will be as smart as we.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; come into existence with beyond human capabilities.  How do those who
</EM><BR>
<P>After a few iterations both should become indistinguishable, due to
<BR>
convergent evolution.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; cherish the equalizing efforts of western governments propose to address
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; these changes?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Should such transformations be outlawed?  If equality is a guiding
</EM><BR>
<P>Would we care if they would be outlawed? At this very minuted we have
<BR>
establishment (both political and economical forces conspicuously
<BR>
unified) going after mp3.com, Napster and freedom of speech (whether
<BR>
pr0n, 3l33t warez d00dz, anticorporate or personal flames or unwelcome
<BR>
polical discourse) of individual users in an attempt to shut them
<BR>
down. The Man does really seem to have a raging hard-on for the
<BR>
freedom of speech. The front lines are now drawn. If the geek reality
<BR>
model is anywhere near accurate, we should see the naive user and all
<BR>
entities with an address in legal, financial and physical space to
<BR>
draw heavy fire and be rapidly sunk. If there is a user base of a
<BR>
critical size being interested to maintain a forum where freedom of
<BR>
speech is guaranteed by untraceable communication and content
<BR>
publishing -- in this context I recommend checking out

<BR>
<P>(particularly dear to my heart, having thought of it 4-5 years ago) we
<BR>
should see such an infrastructure springing up virtually overnight due
<BR>
to suddenly applied political pressure. We do see signs for it
<BR>
happening already, but the future still seems unwritten.
<BR>
<P>As soon as mp3.com is taken out, we should see users rushing to
<BR>
Napster. When Napster is being shut down, users should flock to
<BR>
Gnutella. When ISPs start filtering peer to peer traffic recognizable
<BR>
as such, we will see program suites which use cryptography, and
<BR>
camouflage as bona fide e-commerce sessions (SSL, https). If this is
<BR>
being attacked by key escrowing and outlawing of unsanctioned
<BR>
cryptography plus heavy snooping, we should see advent of widespread
<BR>
steganography in multimedia streams. The big unknown is resistance of
<BR>
anonymous communication and publishing to DoS. This can only work if
<BR>
the infrastructure also supports anonymous realtime digicash. Early in
<BR>
the game there is already a suite incorporating every single of the
<BR>
necessary ingridients.
<BR>
<P>The next years promise to become truly interesting.
<BR>
<P>In case information anarchy wins, it will become synergistic to
<BR>
molecular manufacturing. Things will be much more difficult if the
<BR>
power mongers will win.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; principle, is it fair that a wealthy man can make himself more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligent, giving himself even further advantages?  Can we expect to tax
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; away their gains if they become clever enough to evade the regulations?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Right now IRS goes mostly after a bin of taxpayers too poor to afford
<BR>
good legal and financial advice. Those richer than that already enjoy
<BR>
a relative tax-palliative status.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; And what if we see new forms of intelligent life?  Not every AI may be
</EM><BR>
<P>Not if, when.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; superhuman.  We might have enhanced systems everywhere we turn, up to the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligent drains from Josh Storrs Hall's parody.  Which of these will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; be eligible for the dole?  How do we equalize the lot of a restaurant's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; automated purchasing agent and a strategic economic planning AI?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Restaurant? Purchasing? Strategic? Economy? Do you have any reason to
<BR>
suspect that any of these concepts and items will be conserved?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The modern view is that government can smooth the path of life and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; equalize some of the unfairness.  But it is hard to see how this can
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; translate to the kind of world we envision.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Has anyone done any work on this problem?  Is this kind of thing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; discussed on the non-extropian transhumanist lists?  Extropians take
</EM><BR>
<P>Core transhumnist lists lack fresh blood. However, key memes bred here
<BR>
are currently rapidly diffusing outwards, permeating the more advanced
<BR>
discussion forums first. We have every chance of becoming dogma (and
<BR>
hence obsolete ;) in foreseeable time.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; quite a beating for their adherence to principles of non-coercion and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; voluntarism.  Do the redistributionists have a better plan for the future?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The future have a way of dealing with problems when they arise. Right
<BR>
now we don't have the foggiest what kinds of problems will even
<BR>
arise. I suggest concentrating on the here and now, keeping the
<BR>
Singularity boundary condition at the back of your head. This might or 
<BR>
might not be your strategic advantage.
