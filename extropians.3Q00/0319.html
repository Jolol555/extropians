<P><EM>&gt;For instance. Salmon's aging phenotype (amongst other iteroparous species)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is a good example of a very simple mechanism (and I'm certain you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell me of a species with a very complex mechanism of aging; even if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exist, none are known).
</EM><BR>
<P>How about us?  Everything goes wrong, with a bewildering array of 
<BR>
interelated environmental and non-environmental causes, at widely
<BR>
varying rates in different individuals.
<BR>
<P>Once-off reprocing, or semelparous, species, work as predicted; if
<BR>
there's no chance of repeated reproduction there's no selection for
<BR>
post-reproductive viability, so you get nearly instant death
<BR>
(Pletcher and Curtsinger, 1998)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;There *are* thousands of pathologies.  The phenetic variability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;aging is a problem for *your* theory; you're the one claiming we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;all have the same aging system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's not a problem for my theory: since senescence affects the entire body
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and all systems this leads to a large variety of pathologies. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem for &quot;aging gene&quot; theory is not so much the wide effects
<BR>
of aging as the variability.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I was merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pointing that the evolution of thousands of your proposed pathologies is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;difficult (Strehler in 1986, Mechanisms of Aging . . . I believe does some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thinking about this).
</EM><BR>
<P>And I was pointing out it's not difficult; it's inevitable because 
<BR>
defective or inferior versions of *every* gene will be rattling around
<BR>
in the population (unless pathologically inbred).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;You've got to make up your mind here.  If similarity of aging is evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;for your theory, variability (1) is evidence against it, and vice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;versa.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Not really. Variability (1) is more likely to occur with simple aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mechanisms. However, uniformity amongst a single phylum is also what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expected assuming the causes of aging are the same for all species. 
</EM><BR>
<P>If it's uniform within a phylum it's certainly going to be uniform
<BR>
within a species.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But how do you explain that they occur in mice after 3 years and in humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after 60? Something is the timekeeper of these events. You can say it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;normal developmental program or whatever but something is controlling all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these events; they are not independant of one another.
</EM><BR>
<P>The &quot;timekeeper&quot; is selective value: the detriment of one system failing
<BR>
ahead of the general curve is very high, so &quot;premature&quot; death gets fixed.
<BR>
The benefit of one system outlasting the curve is very small, so 
<BR>
extra-resilient mechanisms get lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;how do you explain Werner's or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hutchinson-Gilford's syndromes? Even if you don't think they are cases of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accelerated aging (which you'll obviously have to be ready to defend),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people with these diseases develop about 50% of all aging phenotypes (50%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of age-related pathologies you claim are independant). As you know,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Werner's syndrome is caused by one single gene. This alone rules out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibility that all age-related pathologies cannot have an upstream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regulator. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not &quot;cannot&quot; in a mechanical sense (although even Werner's only does
<BR>
*part* of aging), but &quot;cannot&quot; in an evolutionary sense: variation
<BR>
in that helicase is not the cause of aging, and the helicase in the
<BR>
normal population will be good enough to be a negligible cause of
<BR>
mortality (which it is; in normal individuals you have many other
<BR>
causes of DNA and chromosomal damage). I have to agree that you
<BR>
could get an &quot;aging clock&quot;; it's not genetically impossible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In addition, it also provides strong evidence that other simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(probably not with just one gene but a few more) mechanisms can be upstream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of most, if not all, aging pathologies. Finally, it demonstrates that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;age-related pathologies do not develop independently and do not originate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in different genes (although other genes can affect their expression).
</EM><BR>
<P>No, two genetic effects which produce many but not all aging phenotypes
<BR>
don't prove that you can't produce those phenotypes by other mechanisms.
<BR>
Indeed, every inbred mouse line seems to have a different way to get
<BR>
old.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;He needs to read the literature: there have been many demonstrations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of antagonistic pleiotropy.  Offhand, I can recall Rose's and Partridge's;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;there are many, many others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Can you mention them (particullarly in humans)? I couldn't find that many.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So far, I've got Lithgow, Rose, Partridge, Johnson, Austad, and Walker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In humans all I've got is Hutchinson's disease increasing fertility.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, calorie restriction works for just about 
<BR>
any species.  One example is the marsupial mice (forget the name)
<BR>
where the males a semelparous and the females iteroparous.  The
<BR>
males die from side-effects of hypertestosterone; crank down
<BR>
their testosterone and they live several years too; but they 
<BR>
reproduce less.  Nagai et al showed that when you breed mice
<BR>
for extended survival you lose early fecundity. There are 
<BR>
sex hormone-survival tradeoffs in many species, including 
<BR>
human males at least.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;P.S. I'm not knocking Medical Hypotheses; there's a role for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;journals.  It's just that things published there aren't really evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;for anything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think there is a place for theoretical biology. In fact, I think there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be more theoretical journals in biology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Medical Hypotheses is not unusual in being theoretical (there is
<BR>
much theoretical work and even some theoretical journals). It's 
<BR>
unusual in publishing mildly crackpot theoretical work - stuff
<BR>
that generates &quot;oh please&quot; or &quot;who cares&quot; responses from editors 
<BR>
of even third-string journals.
