<P><EM>&gt; When you speak of a &quot;PR&quot; model, do you mean that consciousness exists

<EM>&gt; (or appears to exist) primarily for the benefit of other people, rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than for yourself?  That is pretty much the case with PR departments.

<EM>&gt; Perhaps you are conscious in order to make you appear to be more

<EM>&gt; predictable and therefore reliable?  Would consciousness do this, though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it does not actually affect decision making?

<P>Miller in &quot;The Mating Mind&quot; notes that fitness signals are best if they
<BR>
signalan average quality of much of the genome, and hypothsizes that much of
<BR>
our conscious thinking is there to impress others with our wit, cleverness,
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
So he suggests that this might explain why consciousness seems hard to
<BR>
localize in
<BR>
a particular brain module.  Our conscious minds are primarily there to put on
<BR>
a
<BR>
show for others, impressing them with an integrated set of cognitive skills.
<BR>
<P>We tell stories about how what we do is all part of the integrated plan where
<BR>
<P>we talk all our goals into account and use all our skills as appropriate.
<BR>
Those
<BR>
listening to us can then judge our overall cognitive abilities.
