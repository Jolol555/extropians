</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, I thought it a little optimistic too, but the 10% efficiency was
<BR>
conservative enough to make up for it.  We can do better than 10%.
<BR>
We can do mid to high teens without even resorting to the high techy
<BR>
multispectrum cells.
<BR>
<P>I will ask a friend who had a solar panel for several years and measured
<BR>
the power collected, then get back with you on that.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen let us look again at the corn distilling experiment to get an idea
<BR>
of how much energy we devour on a regular basis.  We estimated 1400
<BR>
liters of ethanol per hectare year.  My detroit travels about 10,000 miles
<BR>
a year, thats 16000 km and devours a gallon of petrol about every 14
<BR>
miles, thats 3.87 liters every 22 km, and petrol is about 10% more potent
<BR>
per unit volume than ethanol, so I figure thus:
<BR>
<P>(hectare-yr/1400 liter C2H6) * (1.1 liter eth/liter petrol) *
<BR>
<P>(3.87 liter petrol/ gal) * (gal petrol / 14 mile) * (10,000 mile / yr) =
<BR>
<P>about 2.2 hectares
<BR>
<P>2.2 hectares just to keep my detroit on the road, or about 5.4 acres for
<BR>
of you who know how much an acre is.  You may wish to plug into
<BR>
the above formula your own fuel economy and distance per year.
<BR>
<P>Granted, growing corn and distilling the result is not the best way to
<BR>
capture solar energy, but it does give one a feel for orders of magnitude.
<BR>
When one hears some yahoo say:  &quot;Hey, if we put solar panels on our
<BR>
cars, and let them charge during the day, we could run our cars on
<BR>
electricity.&quot;  After this exercise, we know that that person isnt even in
<BR>
the right order of magnitude.  Another way to look at it is this: if a
<BR>
parking lot capable of comfortably holding about 600 cars were to
<BR>
be dug up, planted in corn and the result distilled, the ethanol produced
<BR>
could be used to power one of those 600, assuming it is an average
<BR>
American guzzler driven an average amount.
<BR>
<P>That same area, covered with solar cells would be able to power
<BR>
about 15 of those 600 cars.  If the cars were all state of the art
<BR>
electrics, the parking lot could power about 25 of em.
<BR>
<P>Conclusion:  petrol is your friend.  spike
