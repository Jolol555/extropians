<EM> &gt; The question posed by this thread intends to discern whether the BCT *should* be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; done. If the BCT (AI/SI) becomes a menace and/or destroys all human life, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; implied supposition is that it might be better to devise methods of containing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; it (or forestalling it) before it is actually constructed or evolved through
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; genetic programming.

<P>Notice that Eliezer does not want to use evolutionary algorithms,
<BR>
probably because he (rightfully) suspects that the result will not
<BR>
necessarily be friendly to mehums, in fact is extremely unlikely to be
<BR>
friendly. His variant is supposed to work (if I get him right) by
<BR>
engineering the boundary conditions that the thing transcends in a
<BR>
very controlled way, falling into a metastable regime (being
<BR>
metastable by virtue of getting there first (which is ascertained by
<BR>
extremely rapid dynamics of positive autofeedback), and keeping
<BR>
everybody else from transcending by occupying that niche, until some
<BR>
external or internal force dislodges it from there), effectively
<BR>
becoming a pet god.
<BR>
<P>Of course if you keep rewriting pieces of you in a strictly Lamarckian
<BR>
fashion, Darwin really really wants to come in through every back door 
<BR>
and hole you might have overlooked.
