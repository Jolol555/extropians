<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;Every generation is filled with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;nay-sayers who say such and such is impossible, despite the seemingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;endless historical evidence of progession.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder, haven't you noticed that, when it comes to information, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; endless historical progression has been toward dissemination?
</EM><BR>
<P>I could as easily say: when it comes to technology, the endless historical
<BR>
progression has been towards destruction.
<BR>
<P>The forces of empowerment rise.  And we as a people, must rise with them.
<BR>
<P>This concept is very close to my core beliefs on this issue.  Our attempts
<BR>
to control the 'untameable' is what's going to keep us in this game.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that we humans are capable of just about anything we set our minds to,
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the exception of large scale consensus.  And that is precisely what it
</EM><BR>
would
<BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to take in order to cram the information genie back into his lamp.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you're right.  We need a way to get ahead of the curve.  Everything
<BR>
is about to spiral (is spiralling) out of our control.  Personally, I'd like
<BR>
to rewrite the rules.
<BR>
<P>A lot of intelligent futurists have written of scenarios in which humanity
<BR>
is destroyed, plowed over or consumed by some inevitable self-replicating
<BR>
technology of the future.  I think this fate is enormously likely.  But if
<BR>
we were really -really- clever, we'd try to write ourselves as a virus into
<BR>
the fabric of reality and bootstrap ourselves into the next sentience
<BR>
echelon.
<BR>
<P>That's why I want us to have serious control over our information-- I want
<BR>
it to be attached to us.  Yes, information would breed faster and be bigger
<BR>
without our interference-- wild horses ARE faster without riders.
<BR>
<P>When certain people hear the term 'IP' they think, &quot;human meddling,&quot;
<BR>
&quot;government inertia,&quot; &quot;artificial restrictions,&quot; and I'm sure they just want
<BR>
to say to me: &quot;Hey, let go of the steering wheel-- it'll be much bigger
<BR>
without you!&quot;
<BR>
<P>And I'm like, &quot;Yeah, but that's my car!&quot;
<BR>
<P>And we'll just sit in the gutter and watch it roar off by itself into the
<BR>
sunset.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I'm not inclined to just sit back and hope it becomes real
<BR>
generous and loops around to pick me up.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree we should answer the question of what is desirable before we get
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; what is possible.  But personally I'm satisfied that freedom of
</EM><BR>
information
<BR>
<EM>&gt; promotes the greater good far more than concealment does.  Your mileage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course may vary, but so far no one has served up a good enough argument to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dissuade me of my conviction.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, this probably boils down to a core philosophical (or more likely,
<BR>
political) divide.  I'm not certain that there is a good enough argument to
<BR>
dissuade you of your conviction (or myself, either.)  I simply think that
<BR>
our goals are different.  I -want- a system over which we constantly
<BR>
struggle for control.  I -want- privacy.  I don't care a whit about free
<BR>
music, I want smart information.  I want complicated transactions,
<BR>
multi-faceted selection pressures, intricate markets, competition,
<BR>
individual creative empowerment, direct positive feedback loops, cheap beer,
<BR>
spidey sense, and a date with Elizabeth Shue.
<BR>
<P>I suspect you think I'm misguided for wanting to ride the bull, but baby, I
<BR>
wanna ride the bull!
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>P.S.: If anyone tells you that I ever lived in the city of Calgary, Alberta,
<BR>
they're damn stinking liars.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>P.P.S.: And especially that part about Elizabeth Shue.
<BR>
