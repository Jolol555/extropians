<P><EM>&gt; This particular Pantheon (or, rather Pandaemonium) will be in the here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and now. Divine indifference is not good enough for us to make it. We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would require active protection to survive.

<P>My friendly robot will protect me from anyone's indifference. 
<BR>
Her motto is &quot;Death to all unfriendlies.&quot;

<P>--J. R. 
<BR>
<P>Mom's Friendly Robot Company:
<BR>
% Fry holds up the tin of anchovies and lays a big, wet kiss on it.
<BR>
% Elsewhere in the city, there is an intimidating building labeled
<BR>
% &quot;Mom's Friendly Robot Company.&quot;  Inside, Mom is being led by her three
<BR>
% companions, named Larry, Walt and Igner, through two huge chamber
<BR>
% doors (complete with security guards) into her office.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom: Mercy me, what a day!  Could you shut the door, Igner, dear?  I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think I feel a draft coming on.
<BR>
<P>% One of them runs over and shuts the door behind them.  The other two
<BR>
% give Mom some room, so she can stand upright.  Once she does so,
<BR>
% though, she begins a bit of a transformation.  Her arms all of a
<BR>
% sudden go completely limp, and we hear a zipper unzip.  A woman much
<BR>
% thinner and more agile than the Mom we know steps right out of an
<BR>
% opening in the front of her body, leaving behind nothing but a large,
<BR>
% hollow woman with no head.
