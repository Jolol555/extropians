<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Uh, actually this argument fails to sway because it defines theft in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; simplistic terms.  You might not be stealing my music if you copy it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; you certainly are stealing my profit.  If you desire something that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; spent energy producing, then it is clear that we should come to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; arrangement by which I should end up with something that you have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; energy producing (like, er, money for instance.)

<EM>&gt;Actually, it just occurred to me that I get about as much enjoyment at the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spa where I work out from watching all the hot female hard bodies in action 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as I do from music - perhaps more.  Perhaps I should be paying them a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;royalty?  They certainly put a lot of work into getting to the point that I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can enjoy the sight of them, and it was probably done at least partially 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the purpose of creating that reaction in the right man.

<EM>&gt;I remember a Chinese legend about a very wise judge who had in his court a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;furious baker who said a poor man in his village would come and stand 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outside his bakery everyday to enjoy the smell.  And the man did not even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recompense the baker for this!!  The judge ordered that the poor man jingle 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the change in his pockets.  &quot;You have now been paid!,&quot; was the response of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the judge...

<P>But now consider the possibility of an &quot;overlaid&quot; (also referred to as 
<BR>
&quot;augmented,&quot; but I prefer the value-neutral more-descriptive term) reality, 
<BR>
in which what you see may very well depend upon whether you agree to the 
<BR>
conditions.  I.e., the hard-bodies may well be disguised by a black (virtual 
<BR>
or real) cloak.  You only get to see them as they want you to, whether you 
<BR>
happen to meet their criteria for possible mate/lover or whether you're 
<BR>
willing to ante up.
<BR>
<P>The VR SIG of the IICS of L.A. once had a session on &quot;teledildonics.&quot;  
<BR>
Suppose sex or intimate interaction at a distance becomes fashionable?  In 
<BR>
the late '70's or early '80's, there was this crotch-mounted subwoofer that 
<BR>
briefly became the rage among the adolescent set, so this may not be 
<BR>
far-fetched at all.  All you need is a remote control and a feedback loop.  
<BR>
Remember the guy in &quot;Brainstorm&quot; who looped the orgasm mind-tape and played 
<BR>
it all day?
