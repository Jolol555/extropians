<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - An enzyme that cancer cells use to keep themselves
<BR>
immortal&quot; might provide a target for a universal cancer vaccine, researchers said on Tuesday.
<BR>
<P>Experiments in mice suggest a vaccine based on the enzyme telomerase might work against
<BR>
a range of cancers, a team at Duke University in North Carolina and Geron Corp. &lt;GERN.O&gt;
<BR>
reported. [...]
<BR>
<P>Gilboa's team found that the active part of telomerase can stimulate development of immune
<BR>
cells that can kill several different kinds of mouse and human cancers.
<BR>
<P>Many researchers are working on cancer vaccines. But there are many different
<BR>
kinds of cancers, and the cells often have their own specific surface proteins that the
<BR>
vaccines target. These proteins are known as tumor-specific antigens.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The thinking has been that because every cancer is different -- melanoma, breast, et cetera
<BR>
&nbsp;-- that each cancer has its own specific set of antigens that must be used for a vaccine,&quot;
<BR>
said Gilboa. &quot;We're looking for a universal antigen -- one antigen to try to treat every cancer patient.&quot;
<BR>
Telomerase might do the trick, he said.
<BR>
<P>&quot;However, by itself, telomerase is not a strong antigen, so to make an effective, broadly
<BR>
applicable cancer vaccine we will need to optimize and possibly combine it with other
<BR>
universal antigens,&quot; he added. His team's vaccine stimulated an immune response that
<BR>
slowed tumor growth of melanoma, breast and bladder cancers implanted into mice.
<BR>
It also worked in human cells in laboratory dishes, they reported. The cells produced
<BR>
immune responses that killed a variety of patients' cancer cells in the lab.
