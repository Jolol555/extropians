<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Physics Questions to Ponder for a Millennium or Two
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;By GEORGE JOHNSON
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who of us would not be glad to lift the veil behind which the future lies 
<BR>
hidden; to cast a glance at the next advances of our science and at the 
<BR>
secrets of its development during future centuries?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred years ago, with those inviting thoughts, the German 
<BR>
mathematician David Hilbert opened his landmark address to the 
<BR>
International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, laying out 23 of the 
<BR>
great unsolved problems of the day. &quot;For the close of a great epoch,&quot; 
<BR>
Hilbert declared, &quot;not only invites us to look back into the past but also 
<BR>
directs our thoughts to the unknown future.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;With another century ending -- a whole millennium in fact -- the pressure 
<BR>
is all the greater to tabulate human ignorance with lists of the most 
<BR>
enticing cosmic mysteries.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In May, the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Mass., emulated 
<BR>
Hilbert, announcing (in Paris, for full effect) seven &quot;Millennium Prize 
<BR>
Problems,&quot; each with a bounty of $1 million.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The list is at: www.claymath.org/prize_problems/.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And last month physicists, with a typically lighter touch, ended a 
<BR>
conference on superstring theory at the University of Michigan with a 
<BR>
session called &quot;Millennium Madness,&quot; choosing 10 of the most perplexing 
<BR>
problems in their field. It was like a desert island game, involving some 
<BR>
of science's smartest people.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The way I thought about this challenge was to imagine what question I 
<BR>
would ask if I woke up from a coma 100 years from now,&quot; said Dr. David 
<BR>
Gross, a theoretical physicist at the University of California at Santa 
<BR>
Barbara, as he unveiled the winners. He and the other judges made the 
<BR>
selection, he noted, &quot;in the middle and after this party in which we were 
<BR>
sufficiently drunk.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;After weeding out unanswerable questions (like &quot;How do you get tenure?&quot;), 
<BR>
the judges came up with enough puzzles to occupy physicists for the next 
<BR>
century or so. There are no monetary prizes, though solving any one of 
<BR>
these would almost guarantee a trip to Stockholm.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Are all the (measurable) dimensionless parameters that characterize 
<BR>
the physical universe calculable in principle or are some merely determined 
<BR>
by historical or quantum mechanical accident and uncalculable? Einstein put 
<BR>
it more crisply: did God have a choice in creating the universe? Imagine 
<BR>
the Old One sitting at his control console, preparing to set off the Big 
<BR>
Bang. &quot;How fast should I set the speed of light?&quot; &quot;How much charge should I 
<BR>
give this little speck called an electron?&quot; &quot;What value should I give to 
<BR>
Planck's constant, the parameter that determines the size of the tiny 
<BR>
packets -- the quanta -- in which energy shall be parceled?&quot; Was he 
<BR>
randomly dashing off numbers to meet a deadline? Or do the values have to 
<BR>
be what they are because of a deep, hidden logic?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;These kinds of questions come to a point with a conundrum involving a 
<BR>
mysterious number called alpha. If you square the charge of the electron 
<BR>
and then divide it by the speed of light times Planck's constant, all the 
<BR>
dimensions (mass, time and distance) cancel out, yielding a so-called &quot;pure 
<BR>
number&quot; -- alpha, which is just slightly over 1/137. But why is it not 
<BR>
precisely 1/137 or some other value entirely? Physicists and even mystics 
<BR>
have tried in vain to explain why.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. How can quantum gravity help explain the origin of the universe? Two 
<BR>
of the great theories of modern physics are the standard model, which uses 
<BR>
quantum mechanics to describe the subatomic particles and the forces they 
<BR>
obey, and general relativity, the theory of gravity. Physicists have long 
<BR>
hoped that merging the two into a &quot;theory of everything&quot; -- quantum gravity 
<BR>
-- would yield a deeper understanding of the universe, including how it 
<BR>
spontaneously popped into existence with the Big Bang. The leading 
<BR>
candidate for this merger is superstring theory, or M theory, as the 
<BR>
latest, souped-up version is called (with the M standing for &quot;magic,&quot; 
<BR>
&quot;mystery,&quot; or &quot;mother of all theories&quot;).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What is the lifetime of the proton and how do we understand it? It 
<BR>
used to be considered gospel that protons, unlike, say, neutrons, live 
<BR>
forever, never decaying into smaller pieces. Then in the 1970's, theorists 
<BR>
realized that their candidates for a grand unified theory, merging all the 
<BR>
forces except gravity, implied that protons must be unstable. Wait long 
<BR>
enough and, very occasionally, one should break down.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The trick is to catch it in the act. Sitting in underground laboratories, 
<BR>
shielded from cosmic rays and other disturbances, experimenters have whiled 
<BR>
away the years watching large tanks of water, waiting for a proton inside 
<BR>
one of the atoms to give up the ghost. So far the fatality rate is zero, 
<BR>
meaning that either protons are perfectly stable or their lifetime is 
<BR>
enormous -- an estimated billion trillion trillion years or more.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Is nature supersymmetric, and if so, how is supersymmetry broken? Many 
<BR>
physicists believe that unifying all the forces, including gravity, into a 
<BR>
single theory would require showing that two very different kinds of 
<BR>
particles are actually intimately related, a phenomenon called supersymmetry.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, fermions, are loosely described as the building blocks of 
<BR>
matter, like protons, electrons and neutrons. They clump together to make 
<BR>
stuff. The others, the bosons, are the particles that carry forces, like 
<BR>
photons, conveyors of light. With supersymmetry, every fermion would have a 
<BR>
boson twin, and vice versa.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicists, with their compulsion for coining funny names, call the 
<BR>
so-called superpartners &quot;sparticles&quot;: For the electron, there would be the 
<BR>
selectron; for the photon, the photino. But since the sparticles have not 
<BR>
been observed in nature, physicists would also have to explain why, in the 
<BR>
jargon, the symmetry is &quot;broken&quot;: the mathematical perfection that existed 
<BR>
at the moment of creation was knocked out of kilter as the universe cooled 
<BR>
and congealed into its present lopsided state.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Why does the universe appear to have one time and three space 
<BR>
dimensions? &quot;Just because&quot; is not considered an acceptable answer. And just 
<BR>
because people can't imagine moving in extra directions, beyond 
<BR>
up-and-down, left-and-right, and back-and-forth, doesn't mean that the 
<BR>
universe had to be designed that way. According to superstring theory, in 
<BR>
fact, there must be six more spatial dimensions, each one curled up too 
<BR>
tiny to detect. If the theory is right, then why did only three of them 
<BR>
unfurl, leaving us with this comparatively claustrophobic dominion?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Why does the cosmological constant have the value that it has? Is it 
<BR>
zero and is it really constant? Until recently cosmologists thought the 
<BR>
universe was expanding at a steady clip. But recent observations indicate 
<BR>
that the expansion may be getting faster and faster. This slight 
<BR>
acceleration is described by a number called the cosmological constant. 
<BR>
Whether the constant turns out to be zero, as earlier believed, or some 
<BR>
very tiny number, physicists are at a loss to explain why.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to some fundamental calculations, it should be huge -- some 10 
<BR>
to 122 times as big as has been observed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The universe, in other words, should be ballooning in leaps and bounds. 
<BR>
Since it is not, there must be some mechanism suppressing the effect. If 
<BR>
the universe were perfectly supersymmetric, the cosmological constant would 
<BR>
become canceled out entirely. But since the symmetry, if it exists at all, 
<BR>
appears to be broken, the constant would still remain far too large. Things 
<BR>
would get even more confusing if the constant turned out to vary over time.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;7. What are the fundamental degrees of freedom of M-theory (the theory 
<BR>
whose low-energy limit is eleven-dimensional supergravity and that subsumes 
<BR>
the five consistent superstring theories) and does the theory describe 
<BR>
nature? For years, one big strike against superstring theory was that there 
<BR>
were five versions. Which, if any, described the universe? The rivals have 
<BR>
been recently reconciled into an overarching 11-dimensional framework 
<BR>
called M theory, but only by introducing complications.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Before M theory, all the subatomic particles were said to be made from 
<BR>
tiny superstrings. M theory adds to the subatomic mix even weirder objects 
<BR>
called &quot;branes&quot; -- like membranes but with as many as nine dimensions. The 
<BR>
question now is, Which is more fundamental -- are strings made from branes 
<BR>
or vice versa? Or is there something else even more basic that no one has 
<BR>
thought of yet? Finally, is any of this real, or is M theory just a 
<BR>
fascinating mind game?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;8. What is the resolution of the black hole information paradox? 
<BR>
According to quantum theory, information -- whether it describes the 
<BR>
velocity of a particle or the precise manner in which ink marks or pixels 
<BR>
are arranged on a document -- cannot disappear from the universe.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But the physicists Kip Thorne, John Preskill and Stephen Hawking have a 
<BR>
standing bet: what would happen if you dropped a copy of the Encyclopaedia 
<BR>
Britannica down a black hole? It does not matter whether there are other 
<BR>
identical copies elsewhere in the cosmos. As defined in physics, 
<BR>
information is not the same as meaning, but simply refers to the binary 
<BR>
digits, or some other code, used to precisely describe an object or 
<BR>
pattern. So it seems that the information in those particular books would 
<BR>
be swallowed up and gone forever. And that is supposed to be impossible.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Hawking and Dr. Thorne believe the information would indeed disappear 
<BR>
and that quantum mechanics will just have to deal with it. Dr. Preskill 
<BR>
speculates that the information doesn't really vanish: it may be displayed 
<BR>
somehow on the surface of the black hole, as on a cosmic movie screen.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;9. What physics explains the enormous disparity between the gravitational 
<BR>
scale and the typical mass scale of the elementary particles? In other 
<BR>
words, why is gravity so much weaker than the other forces, like 
<BR>
electromagnetism? A magnet can pick up a paper clip even though the gravity 
<BR>
of the whole earth is pulling back on the other end.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to one recent proposal, gravity is actually much stronger. It 
<BR>
just seems weak because most of it is trapped in one of those extra 
<BR>
dimensions. If its full force could be tapped using high-powered particle 
<BR>
accelerators, it might be possible to create miniature black holes. Though 
<BR>
seemingly of interest to the solid waste disposal industry, the black holes 
<BR>
would probably evaporate almost as soon as they were formed.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Can we quantitatively understand quark and gluon confinement in 
<BR>
quantum chromodynamics and the existence of a mass gap? Quantum 
<BR>
chromodynamics, or QCD, is the theory describing the strong nuclear force. 
<BR>
Carried by gluons, it binds quarks into particles like protons and 
<BR>
neutrons. According to the theory, the tiny subparticles are permanently 
<BR>
confined. You can't pull a quark or a gluon from a proton because the 
<BR>
strong force gets stronger with distance and snaps them right back inside.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But physicists have yet to prove conclusively that quarks and gluons can 
<BR>
never escape. When they try to do so, the calculations go haywire. And they 
<BR>
cannot explain why all particles that feel the strong force must have at 
<BR>
least a tiny amount of mass, why it cannot be zero. Some hope to find an 
<BR>
answer in M theory, maybe one that would also throw more light on the 
<BR>
nature of gravity.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;11. (Question added in translation). Why is any of this important? In 
<BR>
presenting his own list of mysteries, Hilbert put it this way: &quot;It is by 
<BR>
the solution of problems that the investigator tests the temper of his 
<BR>
steel; he finds new methods and new outlooks, and gains a wider and freer 
<BR>
horizon.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;And in physics, the horizon is no less than a theory that finally makes 
<BR>
sense of the universe.
