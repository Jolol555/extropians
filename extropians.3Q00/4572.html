<EM>&gt;  Not that I think this may have not been a good idea, mind you, but as I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Reagan got the blame for what was essentially an ACLU action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm ... good response, and partly true - but that is not *exactly* as I 
<BR>
recall it. What the ACLU wasn't mandating the closure of the hospitals. First 
<BR>
of all, it wasn't exactly Reagan himself (who seems to have been nothing more 
<BR>
than a good actor in his best role), but Prop 27. 
<BR>
<P>What happened was that the hospitals were closed down : (and I will have to 
<BR>
check my history, because I was only a young pup at the time ; - ) And so the 
<BR>
detention institutions for the criminally insane became overburdened, being 
<BR>
the only resource for poor families of people whoused to get outpatient 
<BR>
treatments at state run facilities. The ACLU stepped in and said: you cannot 
<BR>
retain people and force medication on them, unless they are a danger to 
<BR>
themselves or others. 
<BR>
<P>There is *still* a lobby for mandatory medication on the table, in other 
<BR>
words: Government agencies that will (by force) make mentally ill patients to 
<BR>
take psychotropic drugs, or Lithium or whatever, which is a really scary 
<BR>
idea, isn't it? Now talk about Big Brother! 
<BR>
<P>Sigh... Once again, it's a VERY gray area. I would like to see medication 
<BR>
available for indigent folk, so they can get back on track. I would pay a 
<BR>
percentage of my earnings to assure that kind of social program. Who knows, 
<BR>
someday that could be me, or my loved ones, all it takes is a chemical 
<BR>
imbalance, one tiny ingredient missing from the brain soup -- and POOF!  
<BR>
There you are talking to yourself and wearing garbage bags!
<BR>
<P>But who would trust the police, or the state to regulate who or how much the 
<BR>
poor sot needs to take? (Pictures of mind control experiments, roundups of 
<BR>
depressed housewives forced to take Prozac, or better yet: drugs that help 
<BR>
the economy by encouraging shopping; - ) Argh. 
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, these are not people who can help themselves, unlike so 
<BR>
many of the welfare cases. To be honest, these folks don't KNOW they need it, 
<BR>
and often they *like* themselves the way they are... so *someone* has to take 
<BR>
them in and get them started, because they haven't the mental faculties to do 
<BR>
it themselves! And no one is doing  it *now* - so we have this really scary 
<BR>
homeless population of wandering lost souls, spreading mayhem and disease... 
<BR>
<P>Conundrum city.
