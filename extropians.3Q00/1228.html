<P><EM>&gt; I've seen arguments that the dot.com's tend to drive themselves out of business

<EM>&gt; at an ever increasing rate.  ... Don't cheap copies only do the same thing for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labor market?  ... isn't the problem that the copies compete against each other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to drive the profit out of their specific specialty?  Shouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cost of labor fall to approximately the level of the amortized cost of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware plus the energy required to operate it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Once there is enough competitive entry, then yes.  This is the situation for any
<BR>
innovation.  When the innovation is available to all, competition drives the
<BR>
excess-profit from using that innovation to zero.  But if the first successful
<BR>
entrant is not easy to copy, then that entrant can earn excess profits.  The
<BR>
prospect of such profits, however, can lead to lots of entrant attempts, and on
<BR>
average there are no profits from attempting to enter.  But entry, and innovation,
<BR>
does occur.
<BR>
<P>More concretely, if the first upload company has some intellectual property, they
<BR>
may get returns from that property, and that will raise the market wages above just
<BR>
the cost of hardware and energy.  But as competitors find substitutes for that
<BR>
intellectual property, the excess wage will fall.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since labor is what is required to build increasingly more efficient hardware
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (the self-evolving AI model), doesn't it rapidly spiral to the point where you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have reached the physical limits?  And isn't this just another way of looking at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the singularity?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know.  But I did analyse this stuff a little more formally
