And that is all I will say on the subject except that it is a point of some despair for the future of this race that we are still at arms over abortion after all of these years.

<P>Abortion is a complex and devisive issue to be sure.  But still, I can see easily how abortion would cause people on both sides to be &quot;up in arms&quot; regarding the matter.  And I don't see that as a bad thing for humanity.  I see room and reason for disagreement.  
<BR>
<P>In time with advanced nano and biotech I see the abortion issue largely becoming a thing of the past.  People will have mastered their reproductive capacities totally to their own conscious wills.  
<BR>
<P>But for now I personally see fetuses(unborn defenseless human beings in my view) being killed for often the convenience of the parents.  I consider this a terrible tragedy.  Also tragic though is how often the mother/parents who do have the child face poverty and lack of societal resources to help them.  And some of these children might be born to mothers who are unfit in one way or another to raise them.  And then there is the issue of absentee fathers such as the one I had...  But then so many childless couples so desperately wish to adopt.
<BR>
<P>It is without doubt a complex issue with many sides.  I still view the fetus in the womb as a human being in miniature whether they are a few days old or nine months.  And I believe they have the right to live and the opportunities that come with it even when life starts out hard.  
<BR>
<P>I look forward to the day when humanity is not faced with this issue.  And that time is not too far off from now.  
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
