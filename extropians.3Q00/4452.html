<EM>&gt; &gt; So, I guess I have no fear of the AI being malignant like the “Blight” 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Vinge’s _Fire Upon the Deep_, but I can’t see how it is that we expect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to give a hoot about our puny, little problems, or even to be “friendly”
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to us.

<EM>&gt;	i see no reason that an SI (the kind that eliezer envisions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyway) would experience anything remotely as anthropomorphic as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gratefulness. we are talking about an engineered transcendent mind, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a product of millions of years of evolution -- no parents, no siblings, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competition, no breast-feeding.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	as eliezer points out in his various writings, if such a mind does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything at all, it would be because it was objectively _right_ -- not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because it feels good, and not as a result of any coerced behavior (ie,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evolutionary programming). thus, even if the SI is the best alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the human race, i would still approach it with fear and trembling.

1. All intelligence is fallible.
<BR>
2. Conscious intelligence uses perceptual feedback for base level 
<BR>
correction.
<BR>
3. Emotional interaction with other conscious beings is the only method by 
<BR>
which one can &quot;mirror&quot; one's consciousness, as such.
<BR>
4. Acting as a predator makes real emotional interaction impossible, as one 
<BR>
has to conceal part of ones nature and this required putting a conceptual 
<BR>
process into the loop, defeating the epistemological purpose - perceptually 
<BR>
reaffirming the nature of one's consciousness.  (This is one of the base 
<BR>
reasons polygraphs work - and why we place such an extravagent value on 
<BR>
things like love.)
<BR>
5. Any smart conscious being is capable of figuring this out.
<BR>
Therefore, if the SI is conscious, we probably don't have to worry - 
<BR>
although I would want to have a serious talk with it on this very subject 
<BR>
before I put it on line.  A very smart, non-conscious SI is another matter.
