<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Playing an actuarial game, one may almost 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conclude that given a universe where intelligence might persist into the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billions of years, a kind of convergence of capability to manipulate  even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phyiscal laws would 'naturally' occur.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem here is likely semantics: what do we mean by physical law?
<BR>
The word 'law' suggest something that can be broken and is amenable to
<BR>
change, but given how it is used in science it would be more akin to a
<BR>
computer program: exactly what is the update rule that determines how
<BR>
the universe changes from one instant to the next? 
<BR>
<P>If it turns out that (say) it is possible to change the value of the
<BR>
fundamental constants, this does not mean all laws can be broken, it
<BR>
could just mean that the parameters are changeable, the basic system
<BR>
remains the same. It might turn out that we can blow up extra
<BR>
dimensions to macro-size, hence changing a lot of our physics, but
<BR>
that still leves most fundamentals the same. The question is if there
<BR>
is total freedom (somehow we can change the laws of physics to
<BR>
*chess*) or if there exists meta-rules which cannot be avoided (like a
<BR>
constitution or the 200 rule set in Nomic). For the moment it seems
<BR>
that the meta-rules are simple: no changes to the rules are allowed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;OK, I would gladly settle for a neuron brain in the interrim, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question about it. But it is *so much simpler* than the Omega Point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (we can at least imagine how a nanotech version of it might work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; according to known physics).&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Precisely, but its good to remember that Tipler was playing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decent, mental exercise on how things could happen, not an absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guarantee that they would, or that it axiomatically has to happen in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this way.
</EM><BR>
<P>But that is the problem - Tipler did say it *must* happen in his
<BR>
theory due to his Omega Point Boundary Condition. He doesn't want a
<BR>
contingent Omega that may appear if we play our cards right, but
<BR>
something that *will* occur (if his theory is right). Had he just
<BR>
settled for the contingent version everything wopuld have been fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;What would be suitable storage units? I have been thinking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vortex loops, they look nice and ought to be useful for something.&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmmm. Sounds somehow, profound.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hard science, you know... :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;The problem is that it is accelerating due to the cosmological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constant. The horizons are creeping closer and closer..&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is beyond my level of understanding.  If the horizons or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; boarders of the universe are creeping closer, then it sounds like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its a heat death colapse no matter what?
</EM><BR>
<P>No collapse, rather forced expansion. The particle horizons are due to
<BR>
the fact that accelerating expansion makes it harder and harder for
<BR>
light to reach us, it has to move against the expansion so to say. So
<BR>
if this scenario holds, eventually every particle will be separated
<BR>
from every other by a horizon.
<BR>
