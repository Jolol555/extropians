<P>
Corey asks,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; What exactly IS the relevance of the gun discussion to Extropianism?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think many contemporary issues have great relevance to Extropianism,
<BR>
not only guns, but abortion and drug policy as well.
<BR>
<P>With guns, we have a dangerous technology.  Should it be in the hands of
<BR>
private individuals?  Or should society reserve access to the government?
<BR>
This question is going to arise more and more in the future.  Should
<BR>
people have access to biotech?  To nanotech?  To AI?  To uploading?
<BR>
All of these technologies can be dangerous, some far more than guns.
<BR>
As Extropians I think we generally support the goal of allowing
<BR>
individuals to decide for themselves which technologies they want to use.
<BR>
<P>With abortion, we have the question, when does an entity rise to the
<BR>
level that others should intervene to keep it alive?  Fetuses are
<BR>
a gray area, but technology is only going to make the matter worse.
<BR>
With AIs, artificial life forms, uplifted animals, we are going to face
<BR>
the same issues.  When does it become a crime to turn off your computer,
<BR>
analogous to aborting a fetus?  When does killing an intelligent animal
<BR>
require you to be charged with murder?
<BR>
<P>And with drugs, we have the question of whether people should be allowed
<BR>
to alter their own mental functioning as they choose.  Obviously future
<BR>
technologies are going to allow for far more options in this area, from
<BR>
do-it-yourself drug-building information on the internet, to direct
<BR>
alterations of your mental pathways, to uploads who are able to adjust
<BR>
their own moods at will.  If we won't allow people to mess with their
<BR>
brains today, what does that say about the possibilities for doing so
<BR>
in the future?
<BR>
<P>Another common thread in all of these issues is that not only will there
<BR>
be new challenges, but they will become much more difficult to detect
<BR>
and control.  Today you can theoretically catch someone who is buying
<BR>
guns, getting an abortion, or purchasing drugs.  But in the future
<BR>
there may be high tech equivalents of these actions which can be done
<BR>
entirely in the safety of your own home.  To have effective control
<BR>
over technologies may require a highly invasive surveillance state,
<BR>
which raises many problems of its own.
<BR>
<P>The issues we face today, difficult as they are to deal with, are only
<BR>
a taste of the problems ahead.  We need to identify sound philosophical
<BR>
principles which can guide our decisions on these matters, in order to
<BR>
chart a consistent course through the issues we will soon be dealing with.
<BR>
I think the Extropian Principles have implications for how these matters
<BR>
should be dealt with today, and this makes them appropriate topics for
<BR>
discussion, in my opinion.
<BR>
<P>Hal
