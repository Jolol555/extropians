<EM>&gt; &gt; governments, again...

<EM>&gt; Governments, yes.  But the USA gov't is supposedly a democratic republic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a capitalist economy. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Supposedly, but isn't. In the words of Congressmen Ron Paul and Alan Greenspan,
<BR>
&quot;No, this is not a free market economy&quot;, although they were being rather narrow
<BR>
in qualifying that based on the existence of our fiat money system. When half of
<BR>
the income of the average person is confiscated by government via taxation of
<BR>
all sorts, and when a third of the population is receiving some sort of payments
<BR>
from that government, and when the average business spends a third of their
<BR>
overhead filling out paperwork mandated by government agencies, that is not a
<BR>
'capitalist economy'. Our government was originally a republican democracy
<BR>
(quite a different thing from a democratic republic).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The point I was aiming to make was that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adopting a capatalist economy is not the answer to all the problems you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listed.  There seems to be an inherent unwieldiness to human societies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with centralized governments attempting to control too many people over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too wide a geographical range.  I think you need to address the question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the SIZE of a state before you can even think of avoiding severe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infringments on the individual's right to act upon his or her own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decisions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many contemporary communists claim that the Soviet Union was not communism or
<BR>
socialism, but state capitalism..... of course, they can claim whatever they
<BR>
want, that does not make it true.
<BR>
<P>I agree that the monolithic state is the primary cause of all the wrongdoing
<BR>
described. Breaking the monopoly must occur first. If, after that is done, some
<BR>
wish to volunteer to live under a socialist or communist law provider, that is
<BR>
their choice, but they should not be able to force people to use their services.
<BR>
Any time in history when people are given a real choice, without guns to their
<BR>
heads, most people choose liberty over socialism, so if you end the state,
<BR>
socialism will, in the words of one person 'wither away'.
<BR>
<P>Without the state, socialist, communists, and left-anarchists cannot realize
<BR>
their goals, because their goals oppose human nature and needs so diametrically
<BR>
that force is required to impose their will upon the people. Without a state,
<BR>
what would result is a generally anarcho-capitalist society with pockets of
<BR>
voluntary communal organizations. 
<BR>
<P>Local governments are likely to remain, run on a part time or volunteer basis.
<BR>
Here in NH, we have a good example among many of the smaller communities, where
<BR>
10% of the local government positions are paid, the rest are volunteer. The fire
<BR>
department is volunteer, as is the local constabulary, which is run by the board
<BR>
of selectmen or aldermen. If something comes up that one local fire or
<BR>
constabulary cannot handle, the call goes out to other communities neigboring,
<BR>
and people respond. Large fires will typically bring 6-12 volunteer fire teams
<BR>
from many surrounding communities.
