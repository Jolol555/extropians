<P>Where do you think a bunch of mutually competitive uploads are headed,
<BR>
if you're not part of the fray? AIs might beat them on the path to the
<BR>
SI, if given a chance, but I doubt there will be much subjective
<BR>
difference between them two from an outsider's point of view. (Which
<BR>
probably means that it's not a good idea to play the role of a bemused
<BR>
onlooker).
<BR>
<P>One or two of them might be still human (and nice) enough to yank the
<BR>
bystanders into the virtual realm to prevent them from going extinct,
<BR>
before zooming off to SI.
