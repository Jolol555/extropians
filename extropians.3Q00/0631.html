<EM>&gt;Subject: human/world interface (part 2)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Thu, 6 Jul 2000 13:57:51 -0500
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The kinesthetically oriented person is supposed to be the least
<BR>
<EM>&gt;common.  The instructor was using the word in a broader sense than I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have.  I would have thought that kinesthesia had to do solely with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;movement,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but the instructor used it to include sensations of touch in general, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you'd say a person was using kinesthetic recall when they remember the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feeling of chewing ham, and the texture of toast smeared with marmalade. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wondered why there was no mention of olfactory recall, as smell is supposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be one of the most powerful elicitors of memories. Maybe it's a method 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recall that's not commonly voluntary.  I myself find it difficult to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consciously recall, for example, the exact smell of newly wet pavement,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;although I recognize it immediately upon smelling it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Naturally, I turned out to be weird.  Although I had no trouble with visual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or auditory recall (or projection either--I could imagine things which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;didn't exist in the real world, and see and hear them in my mind), I tended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to use kinesthesia in strange ways, such as when working simple math
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems. And it's a fact, though I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in adding and subtracting numbers, I count by moving my fingers.  For me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this is a simple extension of the way in which I listen to or play music, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have my doubts as to whether it's all that unusual.  But although many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people dance to music,  most people don't report doing math 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kinesthetically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I guess because of my own weirdness, I was interested to read of Damien's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inability to form visual images and his reliance on kinesthesia in doing IQ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tests.
</EM><BR>
That's how I aced the SAT and got my Nat. Merit Scholarship.  I create some 
<BR>
kind of tactile model in my mind and feel around it and manipulate it.  When 
<BR>
analyzing an equation, I would &quot;ride&quot; the curve to see if it felt right.  
<BR>
Unfortunately, &quot;hard&quot; math - limit theorems, etc. - doesn't easilly lend 
<BR>
itself to that approach - or at least that's not the way it was apparently 
<BR>
developed, so I got to a limiting point myself in trying to follow it.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The question by which I'm obsessed today is this:  how does one's method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interfacing with the world affect (is this right, or is it supposed to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;effect?&quot;) one's style of dreaming?  My dreams are almost always in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brilliant color and include sound, smell, touch, taste--the whole works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sometimes I have dreams that are like movies with complex plots--some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them take place on really interesting non-terran planets.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mine usually take place on terra, but are often in some distopian high-tech 
<BR>
future along the lines of Sterling's &quot;Distraction&quot; (which I highly 
<BR>
recommend, BTW - not especially inspiring story, but an amazing depth of 
<BR>
portrayal of that future, including some major idea lines that virtually no 
<BR>
one else has tried to follow (first time I've seen &quot;... Breakdown of the 
<BR>
Bicameral Brain&quot; showing up in a fictional extrapolation!)  Often I awaken 
<BR>
right after learning some incredibly important insight which I can't 
<BR>
remember five minutes later....
