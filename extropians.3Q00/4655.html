</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But....  There isn't any &quot;child&quot; at the point of conception.  There's just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an embryo, which, if it gets a huge amount of biosupport for 9 months, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eventually make it to the point of being a child.  The point at which one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can talk about a child is certainly uncertain at our current state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understanding of the scientific/medical/ethical issues, screwed up as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are by all the religious nonsense and propaganda, but I can state with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certainty that it doesn't qualify as a child at conception, nor at one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;week,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nor at one month, nor at three months.  After that, the level of certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;starts dropping.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's no &quot;certainty&quot; to it at all.  What you have stated is nothing more 
<BR>
than your own personal and arbitrary belief.  (It also happens to be my 
<BR>
belief as well, but that's beside the point.)  The point is that there are 
<BR>
no criteria by which it can objectively and inconclusively be determined 
<BR>
where a human-potentiality ends and a human-being begins.  The only point 
<BR>
where *everyone* will agree that there is not yet a human is just before 
<BR>
sperm breaches egg.  After that, we've got nothing better than &quot;I believe 
<BR>
this&quot; and &quot;You believe that.&quot;
<BR>
<P>So if society conducts itself according to *your* belief that a 3 month old 
<BR>
fetus is mere biological rubbish which can be disposed of without a second 
<BR>
thought, then when society changes its mind about when a fetus becomes a 
<BR>
human, or if objective (biological or ethical) criteria are ever established 
<BR>
which show that you drew the line in the wrong part of the sand, then it may 
<BR>
well turn out that, following your lead, society is a bigger genocidal 
<BR>
criminal than Hitler could ever have hoped to be.
<BR>
<P>I realize that this is much like the debate over the number of angels that 
<BR>
can dance on the head of a pin, but the point is that you are arguing from 
<BR>
*your* beliefs, not from any objective or empirical criteria.  So at best 
<BR>
you (and I) can only argue for what we personally believe and conduct our 
<BR>
own personal behaviors accordingly.  When you start basing *societal* policy 
<BR>
on your own ethical/moral beliefs, you are no better (and no worse) than the 
<BR>
pro-lifers who would do away with abortion altogether because of *their* 
<BR>
belief that, once sperm meets egg, its a human - and anyone who harms the 
<BR>
fetus, batters a human being.
