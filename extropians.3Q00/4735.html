<EM>&gt; &gt; I submit anyone who agrees with that equivalence should then quit using
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; term, because if there's no way to tell art from non-art, then what good
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; labeling some stuff art?  (Unless such labeling is merely to increase
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; asking price for such stuff.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which begs the question, why would we want to label them anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at all?
</EM><BR>
<P>The reason to label anything is to differentiate it from other things so as
<BR>
to have an easier time understanding it and communicating about it.  (The
<BR>
former is more important than the latter.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; people value some objects/designs and not others ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I would not confuse art with design.  The shirt I'm wearing now -- a Perry
<BR>
Ellis short sleeve -- has a design I like on it.  In fact, it's one of my
<BR>
favorite shirts.  Yet I would not label it a work of art.  It is pleasing to
<BR>
my eyes and comfortable to wear, but it is not art.  I value it, yet I do
<BR>
not call it or classify it as art.
<BR>
<P>By the same token, there are things or works which I do classify as art,
<BR>
which I do not value or like.  Some of these art works I'm even repulsed by.
<BR>
Yet I still believe them to be art.
<BR>
<P>You see, something can be art without being valued by someone.  Someone can
<BR>
even agree something is art, yet not like it and not want to experience it
<BR>
ever again.  Someone can love something, yet know it is not art.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ideally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because of some quality of these objects/designs and not because they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; placed into some category. to emphasize such a category is to say that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matters in some way.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.  If people use &quot;art&quot; to mean something is of high value, then I'd
<BR>
say the term is being abused.  Markedly, that's not how most people use the
<BR>
term.  Art works, generally, are set aside for special contemplation.  This
<BR>
kind of blows a whole in the valuing something making it art.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but really, if someone actually purchases some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object/design solely because they think it's &quot;art,&quot; then they have too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much money anyway and i can't pretend to sympathize.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  A fool and her money are soon parted.  But this does not make it
<BR>
art, any more than someone blowing money on swamp land makes her a wise
<BR>
investor.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
