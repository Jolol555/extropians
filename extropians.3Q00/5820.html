<EM>&gt;  &gt; If we expect AIs to want to be friendly toward us, then we'll need to assure the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; AIs that we've done all that's humanly (and inhumanly) possible to make their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; lives the wonderfully pleasant experience that they know. IOW, we'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; keep the AIs happy, and let them know that we are responsible for their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; happiness. They'll love us for making them happy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sigh. You can only make them happy as long as they stay on equal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; footing with us. Very soon after they fall into positive autofeedback
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-enhancement process, you cease to be that. They move on, we stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where we are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can't reciprocate to a god in any meaningful way. Tell me why a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; god should consider us anything else than a feature of the landscape?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because we are also intelligent conscious beings, albeit way s-l-o-w (at
<BR>
least w/o augmentation)?  But then a voice said, &quot;Go tell it to the
<BR>
chimps.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Because we are its creators/progenitors?  For the latter, again, &quot;Go
<BR>
tell it to the chimps.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>OK.  So we hope that inter-species compassion makes really good logical
<BR>
sense and that the AI has a huge heart simply because that is the thing
<BR>
its hyper-intelligence naturally leads to?  We haven't figured out quite
<BR>
why that will be but at least its a hope.
