<EM>&gt;     &gt;the biggest bug in our so-called free-market  is that everything is up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; grabs (freedom, justice)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well yes, but that's a feature not a bug. The best way to maximize anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is to make it a commodity, the market does exactly that with freedom and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justice.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, so you're saying it is a commodity!?  At least your honest about it.  Keep in
<BR>
mind that most people aren't going to sit well with the idea that everything
<BR>
including their freedom is open to the highest bidder.   Fundamentally you're
<BR>
talking about a system where those with the knack to make the most money rule those
<BR>
who don't.  It should be obvious then why free-marketeers are often compared to
<BR>
fascists.  Until you can explain how those lacking key economic success tools can
<BR>
also thrive in such a system, you're going to have a lot of resistance on your
<BR>
hands, and the meme of socialism will continue to thrive.  My challenge to people
<BR>
on this list is for them to convince the rest how such a system will benefit them
<BR>
more than the one we have now.  Until then, these idea will remain just that -
<BR>
ideas, and ill received ones at that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;where he with the most money wins.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Somebody is going to win it's just a question of who.
</EM><BR>
<P>And why is that?  Why not a win-win for everyone?  Unlike many here, I won't stop
<BR>
questioning and thinking about these ideas until I can devise a system that
<BR>
maximizes individual liberty and prosperity.  The point of this thread was to seek
<BR>
out 'bugs' in free-markets.  Are you unwilling to admit that there is always a
<BR>
better way, a better idea than the one you currently possess?  Sure, free-markets
<BR>
and more importantly competitive free-markets are better than monopolized state
<BR>
control.  But why stop there?  That's a pretty vague place to rest, isn't it?  The
<BR>
day we stop question our ideas, is the day we stop thinking all together.  If these
<BR>
ideas are so mature, then why haven't they taken off in the general public more?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Would you would prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictatorship where he who has the biggest gun wins, or democracy where he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who has the best haircut wins?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd prefer that everyone wins.
