<EM>&gt; &gt; Seriously, did you ever do a back of the envelope? You need a lot more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than a few minutes, unless your starting point is way above the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; urslime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back of the envelope? Whazzat? I was thinking that evolutionary algorithms can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; iterate in microseconds as opposed to the days, weeks, months, years, decades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required for living organisms to replicate and produce new generations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Natural selection in digital computers cycles billions of times faster than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural selection in biology, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You are leaving out the costs of simulating a rich enough environment
<BR>
for those evolving virtual beasties to rub up against and be tested by. 
<BR>
Millions or billions of times faster is still not infinite.  It still
<BR>
takes a lot of resources to get a real complex alife evolution
<BR>
happening.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (I'm still counting on un-natural selection to insure that AI would want to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friendly.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>So the AIs learn to be friendly until they are strong enough not to have
<BR>
to be friendly unless they want to.  Subjugated intelligences subject to
<BR>
immediate execution do not tend to develop kind feelings toward the
<BR>
perpetrators.
