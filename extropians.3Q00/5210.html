<EM>&gt;  Henry P. Stapp is trying to explain non-locality by means of his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  quantum-mind-brain model.

<P>I prefer Deutsch's formulation in which he shows a way of looking
<BR>
at quantum physics which is purely local:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9906007">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9906007</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All information in quantum systems is, notwithstanding Bell's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theorem, localised. Measuring or otherwise interacting with a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quantum system S has no effect on distant systems from which S is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamically isolated, even if they are entangled with S. Using the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heisenberg picture to analyse quantum information processing makes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this locality explicit, and reveals that under some circumstances
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(in particular, in Einstein-Podolski-Rosen experiments and in quantum
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teleportation) quantum information is transmitted through 'classical'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e. decoherent) information channels.
<BR>
<P>However I must admit that I can't follow his physics; this Heisenberg
<BR>
formulation is much more complex than the familiar equations due to Bohr.
<BR>
Apparently this paper has now appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal
<BR>
Society, so hopefully it will get more attention and critical review.
<BR>
<P>BTW Deutsch's home page at <A HREF="http://www.qubit.org/people/david/David.html">http://www.qubit.org/people/david/David.html</A>
<BR>
has links to this and some other papers, plus some personal material
<BR>
that is quite interesting.  What Star Trek TNG episode transformed
<BR>
Captain Picard's outward appearance (but not his mind) so radically
<BR>
that the crew refused to follow his orders?  See Deutsch's article,
<BR>
The Final Prejudice, at <A HREF="http://www.webleyweb.com/tle/le970401-10.html">http://www.webleyweb.com/tle/le970401-10.html</A>.
<BR>
(Also has relevance to Barbara's point about &quot;appearance&quot; and humanity.)
<BR>
<P>Finally, there is a mailing list at www.egroups.com on Deutsch's book
<BR>
The Fabric of Reality, in which Deutsch participates very generously.
<BR>
Unfortunately the quality of the discussion is low, much mystical talk
<BR>
about parallel universes explaining ESP, etc.
