<EM>&gt; Robert, don't you mean that you *don't* freely grant this point, *except*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insofar as it is premised on natural cosmic evolutionary processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unmodified by purposeful intelligent intervention (ie your perspective)?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, when I discuss this, I will usually grant this point since the
<BR>
&quot;conventional wisdom&quot; is that there may be both missing baryonic
<BR>
and non-baryonic dark matter.  I've got an explanation for the missing
<BR>
baryonic dark matter that seems to involve no magic physics.
<BR>
To push the non-baryonic dark matter onto the baryonic plate, you may have
<BR>
to change the big bang theories a lot, and I'm not willing to push
<BR>
on that rock yet.  Conversely SIs may find a way to turn themselves
<BR>
into non-baryonic dark matter (with what I would call magic physics)
<BR>
in which case I wouldn't have the foggiest idea how to prove that.
<BR>
<P>I'm like Niel Armstrong -- one small step at a time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also noticed in the paper--which I read but was at some pains to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decipher--
</EM><BR>
(don't worry I'm in the same boat...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; that brown dwarfs were ruled out because of some experimentally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; observed TeraV gamma rays.  These TeraV gamma rays would not--so the theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goes--be there if brown dwarfs with their accepted IR output populated the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; halo in numbers sufficient to account for the dark matter mass.  As I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understood it, the TeraV gamma rays are consumed in an interaction with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IR photons that produces electron/positron pairs.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is the impression I got, though I think they are using it to
<BR>
constrain cooling white dwarfs.
<BR>
<P>[As an aside, I would love it if someone would point me at the theories
<BR>
that say *when* and *how* photons of different energies interact...].
<BR>
<P>However, you notice they say IR photons from 0.03-3 eV -- those
<BR>
are photons with temperatures above that of lN2!  While both
<BR>
white dwarfs and brown dwarfs cannot have cooled down to those
<BR>
temperatures yet (it takes dozens of billions of years), MBrains
<BR>
can certainly have constructed shells that radiate at temperatures
<BR>
below lN2.
<BR>
<P>Minsky told Dyson at one of the earliest SETI conferences that
<BR>
they should radiate at slightly above the background temp.
<BR>
Dyson effectively said maybe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This point, plus other bits and pieces of the observed IR radiation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abundance--the low level of IR, actually--also suggests to me that the dark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter is not composed of large numbers of matrioshka brains.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so because of the possible failure of the 1-10 TeV gamma rays to interact
<BR>
with very low temperature IR photons.  There is an additional argument
<BR>
that they are discussing the progenitors to white dwarfs (e.g. the
<BR>
initial population II stars).  I think this is because the gamma rays
<BR>
at redshift z=0.034 have to travel through a lot of IR photons to get
<BR>
to us.  But if MBrains don't start developing until ~6 Gyr after
<BR>
the formation of the universe (long after much of the IR radiation
<BR>
from the white dwarf progenitors has been produced) then the MBrain
<BR>
IR radiation may not intersect in the time dimension with much of
<BR>
the gamma radiation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If it were matrioska brains *harvesting* the stellar output in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orderly fashion, and then radiating away the waste heat, this would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also result in infrared emissions able to interfere with the TeraV gammas.
</EM><BR>
<P>If MBrains had existed from the beginning and/or were radiating
<BR>
at lN2 temperatures or above, I think you would be correct.
<BR>
But it looks to me like I've got wiggle room.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The issue of the lack of IR radiation plus the dark matter business leads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me to a question I've been mulling over.  Could advanced civilizations halt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the unbridled stellar fusion and save the fuel for a more orderly regime of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumption?  (Is this anything like the *star lifting* business  that I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heard about?)  This seems to me to combine the observed features of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substantial quantities of dark mass and low IR emissions, while still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowing the matter in question to be baryonic rather than something exotic. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I have read Prof. Lorry's (:-)) comment on this and I can only mildly
<BR>
disagree with what he says.   I've seen no peer reviewed paper that
<BR>
says you cannot disassemble stars or that disassembling them produces
<BR>
supernovas.  Criswell's stellar husbandry (aka star lifting) approach
<BR>
(which I have online copies of if someone wants it), to my knowledge has
<BR>
not been disproven.  I have seen suggestions (hints?) that as Michael
<BR>
says, this may age the star prematurely.  I think it depends on
<BR>
whether or not the star has ignited its helium burning cycle
<BR>
(which is what turns it into a red giant).  If all the star is
<BR>
doing is burning H into He, then, removing the outer mass should
<BR>
decompress the core and allow the star to shift down the
<BR>
luminosity curve (G--&gt;K--&gt;M--&gt;L).  You may have to do it *very*
<BR>
slowly to allow the star to adjust.  I suspect there may be
<BR>
some additional complexity depending on the degree to which the
<BR>
star is losing heat primarily through radiation or convection
<BR>
(which may depend on its mass and perhaps metalicity).
<BR>
<P>Perhaps if Amara reads this at some point she could comment.
<BR>
<P>I'll also state that I'm dubious as to whether there is enough
<BR>
mass in our solar system to use Criswell's suggested method
<BR>
for accomplishing the mass removal since it requires some very
<BR>
powerful, and a potentially large number of, particle accelerators.
<BR>
It is worth noting that Criswell expected this process would
<BR>
take hundreds of millions of years.
<BR>
<P>So I suspect the jury is still out on star lifting and it is likely
<BR>
to require a fair amount of theoretical work and some large
<BR>
computer simulations to answer the question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hope I'm not embarrassing myself.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not any more than I manage to frequently do...
