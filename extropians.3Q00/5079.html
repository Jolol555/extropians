<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree.  So why aren't we out building that system today?  Wanna put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; together a business plan and go looking for funding?  Seriously.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm a bit afraid that the business plan would look something like:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     1 - Get lots o money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     2 - Spend lots o money doing heaps of cool research into genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programming, play around with oh so excellent equipment, discover some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excellent stuff, have a bloody fantastic time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     3 - Run out of money with no products/market to show for it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     4 - get a slapping (eek) from the VC(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     5 - Reputation in ruins, become a tramp, scavenge in bins, waiting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the singularity
</EM><BR>
<P>If I might suggest a little alteration...
<BR>
<P>0.1 - Think of something you can get to market, with some research, kind
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a milestone between here and the promised land
<BR>
0.2 - Map out how you can get from where you are now, plus money, to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having that product on the market, accessible by whatever
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;professionals (or, depending on application, hobbyist or regular
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person) can make use of it
<BR>
0.9 - Present that plan to the VCs as a prerequisite to step 1
<BR>
<P>1.1 - Also ask the VCs for management, marketing, and sales help: you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can do the technical stuff, but there's more to a corp than the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CTO
<BR>
1.2 - Try to structure things so that you, and others who share your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewpoint as to the end goal of the corporation, control a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majority (or as close to it as possible) of the corporation;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most of this control can be slient partners/&quot;sleepers&quot; until 4.1
<BR>
<P>2.1 - Keep at least the majority of your research focussed on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;product, or perhaps line of products by now, that you came up with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in 0.1
<BR>
2.2 - As you near production capability, get the help that the VCs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pointed you at to start prepping some test clients, maybe an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entire market
<BR>
<P>3.0 - Deploy product well before selling out of money: at this point,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your sales are just slowing the outflow of cash, not stopping it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completely or even reversing it
<BR>
3.1 - With experience gained from all steps to date, *especially* step
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.0, come up with more products that you can either deploy now, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be deployed with a bit more research
<BR>
3.2 - Keep doing radical research - still with a focus, at least until
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you get profitable
<BR>
<P>4.0 - Eventually go IPO or get bought out, kissing off the VCs for good
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either way, and go profitable shortly thereafter; remember to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep control of the company
<BR>
4.1 - With money worries gone (and the VCs who remind you to focus on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bottom line out of your hair), research can be even freer;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some products should still come out of it, if only as proof that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the research is relevant to reality, as opposed to hypotheticals
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on some metaphysics that are of no practical use (and, having not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been reviewed by others, might turn out to be based on a false
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foundation, thus being totally useless in the end)
<BR>
<P>5.0 - Reputation established, and with a growing financial resource
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base, help build the Singularity in the way you think it should be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done
<BR>
<P>(Of course, for &quot;product&quot; you can substitute any source of financial
<BR>
profit.  For instance, if you can think of a service that only you can
<BR>
provide - you having mastered the field through your research - then
<BR>
that would be an early-stage-useful target for your research.)
<BR>
<P>The key here is not to do everything at once.  Go for something you know
<BR>
you can do, then build on that, and you just might have a chance.
