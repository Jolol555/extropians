<EM>&gt; Another great frustration of mine in this never-ending discussion is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having to constantly remind people of the difference between copyrights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trademarks, and fraud.  Passing someone's work off as your own is fraud,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and trading on the good name of an artist without eir consent is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violation of the trademark on their good name, and I absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support prosecution of those and always have.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, and here is an area where technology can probably work in favor
<BR>
of these desires.
<BR>
<P>Trademarks can be transformed into cryptographic signatures by the
<BR>
author's key.  This will make it impossible to pass something else off
<BR>
as being by another author, without their consent.
<BR>
<P>Fraud is more difficult, but the specific case of taking someone else's
<BR>
work and claiming it is yours may be able to be dealt with by using
<BR>
digital watermarks.  The author's name could be embedded quasi-invisibly
<BR>
in their work.  If someone else claimed to have created it, the author
<BR>
could release a short program which would decrypt and expose the hidden
<BR>
data.  Watermarks are not a particularly robust technology at present,
<BR>
but this could work in some circumstances.
<BR>
<P>A simpler method would be digital timestamps, in which a secure notarizing
<BR>
service allows the author to prove that they were the first one to create
<BR>
a particular work.  In that case it would be easy to handle cases of
<BR>
disputed authorship.
