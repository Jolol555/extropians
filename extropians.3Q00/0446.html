Blaming ideas by Barrow( now at Cambridge I think)  and Tipler at Tulane 
<BR>
doesn't seem profitable since Tipler has already stated that he feels that 
<BR>
religion will become a part of physics as knowledge of the human place and 
<BR>
destiny in the universe increases.  What I suggest, is to &quot;cheerfully&quot; 
<BR>
explain to the merely curious or the misinformed that the universe is way-big 
<BR>
enough for all kinds of religions and  plenty of room left over for atheists 
<BR>
to. Baring that, if they are persistently obnoxious, give their nuts a 
<BR>
healthy tweak.  If you want to dump Tipler, you can always jump to Hans 
<BR>
Moravec (Carnegie Mellon)  or to Max Tegmark (now at U of Penn).  My chief 
<BR>
problem with Tipler is not that his ideas are nutty, but that he seems 
<BR>
reclusive.

<P>&lt;&lt; Do I have to spell it out for you again. lets go. The people are not 
<BR>
&nbsp;interested of geeky religions and math teorems, end of story.
<BR>
&nbsp;If they have alredy formd a predjudice against transhumanism becuse Tippler, 
<BR>
&nbsp;we are all very FUCKED. Then we're seen as a nutty sect, and in for all heck 
<BR>
&nbsp;of a lot of slope before being able to communicate outwards again. And this 
<BR>
&nbsp;just because they skimmed a Tipler page or especially anti- Tipler page.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;So, what to do?
