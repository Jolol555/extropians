From: &quot;Darin Sunley&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rsunley@escape.ca?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;019a01c0266e$f4e859e0$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">rsunley@escape.ca</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; Given that humans are not infinitely complex, it is not an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impossible task to discover the deterministic rules governing human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behaivior.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't need to be infinitely complex to be non-determinisitic.
<BR>
<P>Determinism is fine for classical models of reality-- but frankly I suspect
<BR>
that reality is probabilistic-- and intelligence is probably an example of
<BR>
emergent higher order adaptive structures based on fine grained uncertain
<BR>
processes.  (I'm aware that the jury is still out on this however.)
<BR>
<P>I think that good AI will be aware of these probabilities to an arbitrarily
<BR>
accurate degree and this will give them a lot of power-- particularly as
<BR>
their ability to calculate these probabilities extrapolates out into long
<BR>
term predications.  But a probabilistic model of reality often fails to
<BR>
confer much power-- I might be aware of the precise odds of winning a
<BR>
particular spin of the roulette wheel, but be unable to leverage that
<BR>
knowledge into power
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, convincing her within 30 seconds could very well be impossible, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like you cannot overwrite 64 megabytes of memory with all 0s in less then
</EM><BR>
64
<BR>
<EM>&gt; million (or so) fetch-execute cycles. The n-dimensional Hamming distance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between those two mind-states may be too far to bridge using only 30
</EM><BR>
seconds
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of vocal input. But if you eliminate the time constraint, and give me,
</EM><BR>
say,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 6 months to get her to do a convincing chimp imitation, then again, given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that simulation ability, I don't think it's an impossible task at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Skepticism is the firewall against the system attack you're describing here.
