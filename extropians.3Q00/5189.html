<EM>&gt; From: &quot;John  M Grigg&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:starman125@lycos.com?Subject=Re:%20responsibility%20for%20children&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009181520.IAA17181@finney.org&gt;">starman125@lycos.com</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I look forward to the day when humanity is not faced with this issue.  And 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that time is not too far off from now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How do you envision this abortion problem going away?  The only thing I can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine is universal birth control that is 100% effective.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I'm sure that is what John had in mind.
<BR>
<P>However even if future technology gives us this degree of reproductive
<BR>
control, it will raise many new issues.
<BR>
<P>We talk about father's rights, but what happens when anyone can take
<BR>
microscopic samples from anywhere you've been and either create a clone,
<BR>
or use them to create a baby for which you are the biological parent?
<BR>
<P>Should this be illegal, that is, should society try to stop people from
<BR>
doing this without the consent of the donor?  (David Zindell in his
<BR>
Neverness series called this crime &quot;slelling&quot;.)  Celebrities could find
<BR>
themselves being unwillingly cloned into thousands of babies.
<BR>
<P>And then, there might be cases where consent is difficult to prove.
<BR>
Two people have sex, and the man has arranged to be sterile, but the
<BR>
woman wants his baby and has easy access to his DNA.  The man's efforts
<BR>
to control his reproduction could easily be thwarted.
<BR>
<P>These situations remind us that we are fundamentally information beings.
<BR>
It is the nature of information to be copied, which conflicts with our
<BR>
ideas about the uniqueness of each individual.  The good thing about
<BR>
these scenarios is that the babies are wanted, so presumably there will
<BR>
be loving parents to raise them.
<BR>
