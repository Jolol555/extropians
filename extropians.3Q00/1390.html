</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, the would both be essential to developing a functional
<BR>
reproducing individual (unless you are looking for a really &quot;short&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;slow&quot; mate... :-?).  The genetic program doesn't seem to have
<BR>
feedback loops that completely promote the up-regulation of the
<BR>
production of things like some hormones in response to a decline
<BR>
in production due to random cell loss, nor does it seem to have
<BR>
much replacement capacity after you reach maturity (when I get my
<BR>
hands on that damn programmer....).  Thats why you &quot;may&quot; need
<BR>
GH -- but if we figure out how to:
<BR>
(a) determine reliably (and cheaply) if you are suffering from a loss and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can supplement; or
<BR>
(b) engineer and deliver new cells to complement the deficiencies; or
<BR>
(c) promote the division and differenation of possibly pre-existing stem cells,
<BR>
then we effectively have patches to the program.  (Note that when
<BR>
I look at a problem I try to see if there are different non-intersecting
<BR>
paths for solutions, if so, then the probability of getting at least
<BR>
one of them is to work is much greater.)
<BR>
<P>CoQ10 on the other hand seems to be a double-bind situation.
<BR>
We probably wouldn't need CoQ10 on a prehistoric diet (with a
<BR>
fair amount of meat), but cut out your meat intake and then start
<BR>
taking cholesterol synthesis inhibitors and you have taken a hammer
<BR>
to both the dietary and internally synthesized sources.  Sure you can
<BR>
eliminate the drugs and go back to eating meat, and your mitochondria will
<BR>
be very happy, but your blood vessels won't (but what can you
<BR>
expect when the blind programmer is typing on the keyboard with
<BR>
their nose?).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Aren't you putting a little too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much faith in the rate of technological development?
</EM><BR>
<P>I warned you that I like to live on the edge!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mean if the curve has the shape you imagine but progresses at 50%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rate you had surmised, you can miss the bus! A heartbreaking situation.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it develops at 50% the rate I imagine, then I'm still probably ok.
<BR>
If it develops at 30% then its probably even money that I'm a popsicle.
<BR>
If Robin's economics are correct then its likely that many of us with
<BR>
extended lifespans, reanimated or uploaded will be relying on the
<BR>
generosity of strangers to provide economic niches.  I'm not overly
<BR>
optimistic on those proabilities (unlike LE itself).  Unlike many
<BR>
people on the list (lets say Natasha perhaps), its only some days
<BR>
that I wake up and view the possibility of completely re-engineering
<BR>
myself and self-evolving into who knows what with complete enthusiasm.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or, Robert, do you, as you're so close to the cutting edge, know something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we average LE people don't know?
</EM><BR>
<P>On my current life, I've got maybe 30+ years left (on average).
<BR>
That would be equivalent to looking back to 1970.  We didn't
<BR>
even *have* genetic engineering, much less the genome in 1970.
<BR>
I'm simply guesstimating the progress of the last 30 years
<BR>
continues and increases over the next 30.  I cannot imagine
<BR>
that in 30 years we would not be able to grow and administer
<BR>
replacements for every organ and supplement your mind with
<BR>
tailored neuronal stem cells.  And that is without having *any*
<BR>
nanomedicine, which if Robert Freitas is correct, will develop
<BR>
like wildfire once you have diamondoid nanoassembly, which if
<BR>
Jim Von Err is correct, we will have by 2010.
<BR>
<P>Mind you, I don't recomend my approach to people much older than
<BR>
myself (43).
