<EM>&gt; Moscow is supposed to have an anti-missile system, I don't know if it is ever tested.

<EM>&gt; Matthias Rust flew right into Red Square, no?  This was known to the rest of the world, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't really a big deal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Matthias flew in at just above treetop level, something their
<BR>
anti-missile system is not capable of dealing with. The national
<BR>
perimeter radars SHOULD have spotted him, over the Baltic Sea, but the
<BR>
men occupying them were likely too drunk at the time to notice, or care.
<BR>
<P>Having been in the bunkers of our own NORAD radar systems (the enlistees
<BR>
who watch the radar screens are called 'scope dopes') I know we can spot
<BR>
low level planes pretty well, even small ones. If they don't respond
<BR>
with a proper IFF code, and don't respond to a radio hail, interceptors
<BR>
go up to check them out. Usually its an idiot whose radio is off or dead
<BR>
or non-existent in a civil aircraft. Occasionally, its a drug smuggler,
<BR>
who will get dropped in the drink if he does not land as commanded. Once
<BR>
in a great while, its a Russian Bear Bomber (don't know if they still
<BR>
fly today, but they were the primary means for Russian spies in Silicon
<BR>
Valley to radio out intelligence data  in the 80's outside of 'fishing
<BR>
trawlers' on the west coast) flying off the coast.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My advice:  drive friendly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About the lasers I think you can adjust the frequency to make them non-visible or something,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ablative and reflective materials would still be effective laser retardant.  How about a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; magnetic tube focussing a plasma burst from a tokamak, except it would diffuse when it got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past the containment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any amount of ablation will turn to plasma rather quickly from laser
<BR>
hits, and will act as thrusters to destabilize the MIRV. If it tumbles,
<BR>
it burns up.
