<P>
Thank Extropy Its Friday.
<BR>
<P>I have a close friend who is putting together a great argumentative paper
<BR>
surrounding human cloning issues.  Many elements of our continuing
<BR>
discussion have considerable relevance to extropian agendas
<BR>
<P>Two such issues, which apply not only to biotechnology, but directions and
<BR>
applications of new scientific discovery and technological innovations in
<BR>
general, are these:
<BR>
<P>1. The education of the public about scientific advances such that they can
<BR>
make more informed decisions about technology and its regulation through
<BR>
legislative initiatives.
<BR>
<P>And, one logical means to this end,
<BR>
<P>2. Directed efforts to bridge the communication gap between scientific
<BR>
communities and the public.
<BR>
<P>As an undergraduate, I took a class entitled Contemporary Biology and Human
<BR>
Affairs, wherein I was assigned a large project to survey and evaluate a
<BR>
representative population of American citizens.  What (my) data suggested
<BR>
was firstly, that a significant percentage of people reflect an unusual
<BR>
stereotype of scientists (probably acquired through the accentuation of
<BR>
'eccentric qualities' of a very small subset of scientists, in the media,
<BR>
especially film [frankensteinian mad-scientist types]) secondly, people who
<BR>
admit they are not educated about a given scientific finding (or the
<BR>
technological applications thereof) often exhibit fear and mistrust by
<BR>
default.  Most people surveyed did not have clearly defined stances on
<BR>
biotechnology issues such as human cloning.  An unfortunate percentage of
<BR>
people surveyed reported that they did aspire to learn more about those
<BR>
issues.  I believe that changing this latter attitude is probably
<BR>
prerequisite to further efforts.
<BR>
<P>In addition to presentation of relevant issues to the voting community, the
<BR>
manner in which new technologies are presented to the individuals who
<BR>
represent them was also acknowledged in our discussion as critical.  This
<BR>
brings me to my current situation.  In the interest of evaluating the manner
<BR>
in which human cloning issues were presented to our representatives, we
<BR>
would like to see if we could get our hands on a copy of the document that
<BR>
was submitted to president Clinton when the government was intensely (and
<BR>
publicly) interested in human cloning (and whether or not they should impose
<BR>
a ban on it in the USA).  
<BR>
<P>Wouldn't you like to know how the pro's and con's were presented to your
<BR>
president?  Wouldn't it be sort of useful for us to know how this and
<BR>
related issues (to tie this back to extropian initiatives) are presented to
<BR>
those that govern us?  If we knew how they conceptualize new technologies,
<BR>
we would be in a much more informed position from which to influence both
<BR>
legislation and public opinion?
<BR>
<P>My first question: is this classified information?
<BR>
My second question: if not, how do we acquire this information, or do any
<BR>
among you possess it?
<BR>
My third question: if it is classified, should it be?
<BR>
<P>Any feedback on this matter would be most appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Ryan v24.2
