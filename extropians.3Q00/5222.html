<P>
Starting off three separate, related threads.
<BR>
<P>I've noticed that *very* few of us have publicly mentioned having children.
<BR>
(Me, Barbara, Keith Henson, Sasha, Minsky, uh...)
<BR>
<P>Many are relatively young, and single.  But many are not.  Have you 
<BR>
consciously chosen not to have kids?  If so, why?  Do you have kids, but
<BR>
have chosen not to mention it?  
<BR>
<P>Of those who admit to having meat-spawn, how have you raised your kids?
<BR>
How do you deal with biases of the school system?  Are they given any sort
<BR>
of religious upbringing?  Do your kids know about libertarianism, cryonics,
<BR>
nano-technology, space colonization, SETI, the Singularity, etc.?  Do they 
<BR>
share your interests?  Have you taken any particular steps to inculcate 
<BR>
rationality in them?
<BR>
<P>Those of you with life-mates:  how do they feel about your extropian
<BR>
interests?  Do they share them?  Tolerate them?  Did they share any of
<BR>
these interests prior to the start of your relationship, or did you convert 
<BR>
them?  (Or, did they convert you?)
<BR>
<P>And for everyone:  Do you try to pass the memes on to your friends and 
<BR>
colleagues?  How successful have you been?  Who seems the most/least
<BR>
receptive?  What approaches worked?
<BR>
