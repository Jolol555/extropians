<EM>&gt; despite our best efforts; this expands into most of the insect world.

<P>Given current technologies we could probably extinct ants, but it
<BR>
wouldn't be a good idea given the key positions they hold in various

parts of the ecosystem.  Now on the other hand we are being very

aggressive and will probably become more so (with increasing tool
<BR>
sophistication) regarding the parasite and carriers of malaria.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it really as clear cut as we often make out that SIs would entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dominate sub-SIs? Or is there some room for competition, based on different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requirements? For instance, perhaps those SIs will require so much energy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operate, that there can't be many of them, and they can't really afford the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort required to stomp out all those pesky human-nests. Thoughts?

<P>If you occupy a nitch below the noise level of another species/entity,
<BR>
then you will be ignored.  However, I don't consider trying to take
<BR>
a star &quot;dark&quot; being below the noise level of nearby SIs.  Nor too would
<BR>
sub-SIs launching 1000 ton vessels for neaby stars at some significant
<BR>
fraction of light speed.
