</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I know it's been tossed about before, but I'm wondering if the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computer geeky extros might like to put together a TH game? Between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those with coding skills, artists, musicians, and game design talent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (anders, that's you), we've got the right people. I know none of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has a lot of time, but together maybe we can make something. I'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thinking an opensource project (via sourceforge). I'm sure I contacted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someone here about doing a game some time ago, and never followed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (sorry). If there were a few of us, we'd all be comitted (to each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Been there, done that, wrote the obit.  (I think there are still pages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out there touting Project: Von Neumann, if anyone wants to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; searching.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Sad to hear your project died; much similar experience.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you want to do this, then define what the game *is*, and *is not*, up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; front.  If it's going to use a 2D sprite engine, so be it - once that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decision is made, there can be no more &quot;wouldn't it be cool if we did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3D&quot; decisions.  Likewise, if you decide to do it as 3D, then commit to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it - either get an engine or get someone to write one that suits your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs - and don't backpedal into a 2D sprite engine.  Otherwise (in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either case), you wind up in an infinite loop of suggesting new features
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that no one wants to write, exiting only on project abandonment, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moderator: What do we want?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Others: X!  It would be so cool if we had X!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moderator: Ok, who's going to do it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Others: ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moderator: Ok, we're not doing X since no one's stepping up.  What else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   do we want?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Others: X!  It would be so cool if we had X!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moderator: &gt;_&lt;  I give up.  See ya.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Others: It would be so cool if we had Y!  Yeah!  Umm...hello?  Anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   still out there?
</EM><BR>
<P>Defining what it is/is not is definitely something I want to do up front.
<BR>
For starters, I don't really want to do a graphics based game at all. Yes it
<BR>
would be cool, but it's got such a low probability of coming together, that
<BR>
I'm just not interested.
<BR>
<P>An nice tool for getting a project happening is to define phases. Phase 1 is
<BR>
what we do now, and what will definitely be delivered. Phase 2 is what you
<BR>
do after you've got phase 1 working (if things get that far, and there is
<BR>
still momentum). Phase 3 is the &quot;real&quot; project, the full wishlist, ie:
<BR>
fairyland.
<BR>
<P>Hey, what's to say you never get to phase 3? You might. Don't put serious
<BR>
money on it though.
<BR>
<P>This kind of framework copes with scope creep rather successfully, in my
<BR>
experience. All the &quot;cool&quot; stuff goes to phase 3, or phase 2 if it is
<BR>
practical without major rewrites. Phase 1 gets defined up front and doesn't
<BR>
change.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, the problem with an open source project is that you don't *get*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that kind of control.  This can be fine once the game is developed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are playing - few will seriously listen to someone who whines
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the existing game not being 3D so long as it *is* existing - but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the early stages of the project, when all anyone can do *is*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speculate and offer feature suggestions, this kind of feature creep can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be fatal by preventing version 1.0 from ever materializing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fair enough. Hopefully anyone who is interested will read the above, and
<BR>
take it into account.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'd be most interested in doing a massively multiplayer online game;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; might even be able to provide hosting. If there's enough groundswell,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; however, I'll back whatever everyone wants to do; I must be involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in writing a serious computer game at some point before I die
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (hopefully that's not soon, but hey).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you want to make a MMOG open-sourced, perhaps the worst problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you'll face is people hacking the code.  For example, VR is only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pseudo-real so long as the artifacts of it being a computer program are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not allowed to dispel the illusion; someone concerned solely with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; racking up points will want to reduce the program to what it is, with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concern for the illusion of reality which that user does not share.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have stated elsewhere that I'm looking at a browser based, html based
<BR>
game. No client, so no hackability.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless, of course, you want to encourage hacking, and see the effects of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a Matrix-like envrionment where power goes to those who can manipulate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;reality&quot; the best.  Which might well fit in with the themes you wish to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explore, though note that this kind of game would devolve to being about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the game code itself, possibly including bots and other low-intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AIs, but not any elements that are in the game only by simulation...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That would fit extremely well into Phase 3.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (BTW, I'm only playing Devil's Advocate here to make sure you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spend your energies on a project that will go down the tubes.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitely possible to pull this kind of project off, but only with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; careful guidance, at least until you have a full game that can be played
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without spending significant energies to work around the installation or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bugs.  Either sucess or investment elsewhere would be preferable to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failure.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for your feedback. I'm wanting to do something very small and
<BR>
managable, by aiming at a browser based, html based, massively multiplayer
<BR>
game. Free (as in free beer) for players, and accessible to all because you
<BR>
don't need a particular web browser or to run particular client software.
<BR>
<P>I think people automatically read &quot;graphics&quot; when you say &quot;game&quot;, and
<BR>
underestimate the market for quality non-graphical games. After all is said
<BR>
and done, the graphical games are just so much eye-candy, which is cool - I
<BR>
do have a certain thing for arcades, after all. But a good cerebral strategy
<BR>
game that allows lots of players (designed to accomodate occasional players
<BR>
and heavy players alike) has a very strong appeal, to exactly the kinds of
<BR>
people who might seriously consider transhumanism, in my opinion. So a
<BR>
useful mmpg game could be both doable (ie: manageable) and perform some
<BR>
important meme-propagating functions.
