<EM>&gt; Could anyone explain why this should effectively &quot;fix&quot; checkpoints?
</EM><BR>
<P>I haven't researched this stuff in years, but my impression would be
<BR>
that anything that slows down the cell cycle (such as a topisomerase
<BR>
inhibitor) should help.  (Topisomerases function to relax supercoiled
<BR>
DNA, which is what you get when you unwind DNA for replication).
<BR>
<P>You have to keep in mind that the checkpoints for DNA replication
<BR>
and repair (for 3 billion bases) really must be a *kludge* of
<BR>
a system.  To replicate 3 billion bases in perhaps 8 hours
<BR>
(1/3 of a cell cycle?), with an enzyme (DNA polymerase) that
<BR>
can copy perhaps 30 bases/second requires ~3500 copies of
<BR>
the enzyme running simultaneously.  Now add to that the
<BR>
problem that the copying complexes will variously run into
<BR>
damaged DNA that has to be repaired (so you have to wait for
<BR>
the repair complexes to diffuse over to your location...).
<BR>
<P>I've never seen a way for those complexes to collectively
<BR>
&quot;vote&quot; to inform the cell &quot;I'm done&quot; in a reliable fashion.
<BR>
If that is true, then nature must simply have timed the cell
<BR>
cycle with a fairly conservative estimate of how long the
<BR>
repair and replication *should* take.  If it underestimates
<BR>
that time -- &quot;ooops&quot;.   So a decent strategy for preventing
<BR>
cancer would be to hit cells with substances that don't
<BR>
*really* damage DNA but activate DNA damage &amp; repair responses
<BR>
(I don't know what those might be other than thymine dimers),
<BR>
and also slow down the cell cycle with drugs such as topisomerase
<BR>
inhibitors.  That is going to increase the probability that
<BR>
all of the DNA is repaired and replicated properly before
<BR>
cell division is allowed to proceed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Remember if you lick atherosclerosis and cancer - you add years to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life. If you fix checkpoints a lot of senecent cells also get zapped and are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weeded out from your body.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you fix heart disease and cancer, I think you extend average longevity
<BR>
by ~8-12 years.  (See papers on the Compression of Morbidity by J. Fries
<BR>
from Stanford, <A HREF="http://www.aeiveos.com/Aging/Authors/fries-jf/">http://www.aeiveos.com/Aging/Authors/fries-jf/</A>).
<BR>
<P>Fixing checkpoints will not zap senescent cells.  This involves a
<BR>
misunderstanding of the purpose of checkpoints and the mechanisms
<BR>
of scenescence.
<BR>
<P>The checkpoints exist to regulate the cell cycle so that things
<BR>
get done in the correct sequence to allow cell division to work.
<BR>
Scenescent cells are those who have replicated so much that they
<BR>
have reached the end of the useful reliably &quot;healthy&quot; lifespan.
<BR>
They presumably have short telomeres.  Scenescent cells are
<BR>
presumably dangerous if they continue replicating (usually
<BR>
having turned on telomerase to achieve this).
<BR>
<P>So, to block the replication of cells have escaped from the
<BR>
scenescence path (potentially having accumulated lots of DNA
<BR>
mutations due to their lengthy replication history) you need drugs
<BR>
like telomerase inhibitors or topisomerase inhibitors.  To *kill*
<BR>
them you need to activate the apoptosis pathway (if it still
<BR>
works) with some nasty toxins or a lot of DNA double strand
<BR>
breaks (e.g. radiation).  Scenescent cells, that stay scenescent,
<BR>
are probably not very dangerous or harmful (over time they probably
<BR>
function less and less efficiently).  Its the cells that have
<BR>
bypassed the scenescence blocks that have the potential to
<BR>
cause cancer.  Where some confusion creeps into this is due
<BR>
to the fact that the p53 gene is a major player in both the
<BR>
&quot;damage is present, lets slow down the cell cycle&quot; pathway and
<BR>
&quot;really bad damage is present, lets commit Hari Kari&quot; pathway.
<BR>
<P>It is worth noting that to fix both heart disease *and* cancer
<BR>
you have a sticky problem.  You want to add telomerase inhibitors
<BR>
to block potential cancers in the body but you want to add
<BR>
telomerase promoters to extend the replacement capacity of
<BR>
scenescent cells at the high-pressure (= high wear &amp; tear)
<BR>
locations in your arteries.  Telomerase promoters would probably
<BR>
also boost the decline in your immune system with age.
<BR>
<P>So solving these problems simultaneously is not going to be easy.
