</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How many extropians does it take to change a lightbulb?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; **********************************************************
</EM><BR>
<P>Amaaaaaaara!  Haaaaa, this is the best extropian post Ive seen in a looong
<BR>
time!  Thanks, love it.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>OK, how many extropians to change a light bulb?
<BR>
<P>A:  Well, depends on if you include the team of a standing by to
<BR>
freeze the old bulb until such time as it can be repaired in the indefinite
<BR>
<P>future.
<BR>
<P>A:  At least three.  One to install the new bulb and accidently drop
<BR>
the old one, at which time a second extropian hurls another bulb to
<BR>
intercept the first one before it crashes to the floor.  The third
<BR>
extropian
<BR>
is required to argue that what the bulb hurler has just done is politically
<BR>
<P>ill-advised and furthermore cannot be done.
<BR>
<P>A:  None, since extropians know the *really* cool guys have
<BR>
*wearable* lightbulbs.
<BR>
<P>A:  Two.  One to earnestly change the bulb while the other makes
<BR>
witty comments and types things like {8^D's.
<BR>
<P>A:  Thirty.  One to change the bulb and the others to argue
<BR>
over whether the task could theoroetically be done faster than light.
<BR>
<P>A:  One.  He would pull out a sidearm, blast the burnt out bulb
<BR>
and sit in a self-satisfied darkness.
<BR>
<P>A.  About ten.  One to change the bulb while the others wonder
<BR>
if there is some way to *artificially* bring the new bulb into this
<BR>
world without a bulb changer.
<BR>
<P>A.  Five.  One to change the bulb, the other four to discuss how
<BR>
light bulbs evolved filaments so much larger than necessary
<BR>
for their survival.
<BR>
<P>A:  Not sure, but BEST CHANGE IT SO.
<BR>
<P>A:  None.  They would reason that changing the light bulb would
<BR>
be equivalent to bulb-fare, which would simply encourage other
<BR>
light bulbs to cease functioning, thereby increasing the tax burden.
<BR>
<P>A:  One to change the bulb, one to post conspiracy theories regarding
<BR>
what caused the bulb to burn out.
<BR>
<P>A:  Hey, lets propose a meme to ideas futures!  Each person involved
<BR>
in the bulb changing would add one cent to the payoff, if the bulb
<BR>
should get changed.
<BR>
<P>A:  It would take only one, assuming he would get off his lazy ass and
<BR>
do it.
<BR>
<P>A:  One could do it, but the others would argue the bulb should have
<BR>
the freedom to exist in a dark room, without the tyranny of the masses
<BR>
who like light.
<BR>
<P>A:  Unknown, but fewer than the number of transhumanists or mensans
<BR>
required.  (kidding! bygones, transhumanists and mensans  {8^D  )
<BR>
<P>A:  All of us, for we would encourage each other to run bulb-changing
<BR>
software as a background process on our computers.
<BR>
<P>A:   One, so long as he is Tigger, wooo hooo!  But if he is Eeyore,
<BR>
he fears that the light bulb cannot be changed.
<BR>
<P>A:  One to change the bulb, one to toss out a cheap pun on bulb
<BR>
changing such as: &quot;Oh this activity provides me with such ful-
<BR>
filament&quot;, another to pick up the pace with, &quot;yes, it makes me
<BR>
so happy I am up on current events...&quot; and so on until a wicked
<BR>
pun-fest results.
<BR>
<P>The cult thing.  Why not just *be* a cult?  What is sooo baaad
<BR>
about just being a cult?  Own it!  If someone accuses us of being
<BR>
a cult, why dont we just say, OK, you caught us, we are a cult,
<BR>
we admit it.  Why not?  spike
