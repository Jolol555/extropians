<EM>&gt; I've noticed a trend of what you might call, &quot;armchair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environmentalists.&quot;  People who will strongly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticize polluting companies in private conversation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with each other, who might recycle, who might write an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; editorial peice to the newspaper, might even have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poster on their wall somewhere, or a bumper sticker on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their car, but whose interest in the environment is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise editorial.  Few in the modern day seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to truly do anything about the environment,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I think this is in part due to social factors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counteracting any sort of activism.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the northern reaches of New Hampshire, whole townships that are undeveloped
<BR>
or which have fallen back to nature outside of a few logging roads, where from
<BR>
my camp I could actually walk 30 miles through total wilderness to cross the
<BR>
Canadian border without crossing a single road, I have rarely seen anyone who
<BR>
could be classified as an 'environmentalist'. There are a number that congregate
<BR>
on Dartmouth's Second College Grant township, who are students or alumni of that
<BR>
school, but I could count on one hand the number of times I've seen any of them
<BR>
on the side of that property that my cabin is adjacent to, or in the whole Four
<BR>
Mile Brook watershed that makes up almost 1/3 of the college's property.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From appearances sake, the loggers, foresters, and hunters and fishers care far
</EM><BR>
more for the land and wildlife than the few 'environmentalists'. The few times
<BR>
I've seen them, it is because they are so ignorant that they cannot read the map
<BR>
in their hands, and are hopelessly lost (either while on or within shouting
<BR>
distance of a logging road).
<BR>
<P>This weekend, while fly fishing on the west branch of the brook, I saw three
<BR>
moose, a bear, a couple deer, and caught several dozen brook trout, only two of
<BR>
which I kept and are sitting in my freezer for tonites dinner...
<BR>
<P>I have a great amount of respect for the dedication being shown by those who
<BR>
have gone through the Ruckus Society's boot camp (and similar camps run by
<BR>
Greenpeace, etc), though I don't have much at all for the ignorance they
<BR>
typically show of the environment itself. They know nothing about identifying
<BR>
and tracking animals, of foraging off the land, and about smart conservation
<BR>
practices in the field. They seem to know a lot about law, of force, propaganda,
<BR>
and other political activities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One needs look only so far as the results of the WTO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;riot&quot; to see why people are afraid of trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accomplish anything.  Eye-witness accounts report the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and other deterrents,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well as physical attacks and long-term harrasement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to drive protesters to the point of frenzy.  There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were also reports of plainclothes cops acting as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rioters in order to stir up action-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;I believe also the police had their own people in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there, encouraging people to break stuff - if people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think I may be exaggerating, I saw supposed protesters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - they were screaming and so on - and then later, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything was over, the same people tackled other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protestors and put handcuffs on them.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;        -Witness account from the WTO protest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This kind of thing, paired with the public view of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activists as somewhat crazy, makes people not want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; put any serious effort into causes they believe in.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, as one movie character once said:&quot;Charlie has his shit together.&quot; So
<BR>
far as political tactics, these people do good work. The tactic of 'jail
<BR>
solidarity', where arrested protesters refuse to even identify themselves or
<BR>
others, so that they cannot even be arraigned constitutionally, has been very
<BR>
effective, not only in reducing the convictions protesters have received, but in
<BR>
inhibiting the FBI's ability to do effective intelligence against these people.
<BR>
<P>The practice of weaving street theater and non-violent sabotage tactics are
<BR>
effective in getting their message noticed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One wonders if there aren't more &quot;armchair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extropians&quot;, &quot;closet environmentalists&quot; and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sorts living in prohibitive environments where their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voices cannot be heard, or perhaps only their voices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot be heard, out of fear of violating social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; norms. 
</EM><BR>
<P>An odd thing happened to me at Sasha's funeral I had forgotten to mention: when
<BR>
I had commented that it was unfortunate that he was not cryonically suspended to
<BR>
some attendees, they laughed as if it were a joke, and these were friends of
<BR>
Sashas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even feeling strongly about things seems to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discouraged in the modern day- both from the popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cynicism that seems to be on the rise, and the idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that any effort of any kind is useless.  There is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large group of people who are politically independant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but vote for either democrats or republicans as &quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lesser of two evils&quot; one of which will, &quot;inevitably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; win anyways.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact is that because of the lobster cooking incremental strategy being used
<BR>
by authoritarians, most people either don't notice, or don't care that their
<BR>
goose is slowly being cooked. The small small percentage that do complain are
<BR>
easily painted as 'nuts' by the propaganda machine, and the sheeple want to
<BR>
beleive it is so because subconciously they need to rationalize their own moral
<BR>
compromise. So long as this incremental strategy continues, and so long as there
<BR>
is no big moneybags willing to finance an extropian activist front, then things
<BR>
will continue as they are. If you look at all of the protests that happen in the
<BR>
media, on the streets, etc. these are not spontaneous things, despite the crap
<BR>
you hear in the media. These people are very well financed, as evidenced by
<BR>
Jeremy Rifkins groups that are backing the Turningpoint Project, which spent 1.5
<BR>
million on full page ads in the NY Times.
<BR>
<P>No insurgency can function without sustained long term financial and material
<BR>
support from some source. So long as extropians fail to acknowledge this and
<BR>
decide to do something about it, we will continue to get pummeled by the
<BR>
luddites.
