<P>Of course, exactly, and this is true everywhere. My `free' medical costs me
<BR>
1.5% of my tax bill. If I'm sufficiently out of luck that I don't *have* a
<BR>
tax bill, not having earned as much as about $6000 in a given year, then
<BR>
people who earn more than I do are forced to subsidise my medical fees. (If
<BR>
they were sufficiently outraged at this interpretation of the social
<BR>
contract, they could *vote in a new team* who wiped out this provision.
<BR>
Although there has been a small current in that direction, I perceive a
<BR>
backlash against it in Oz right now, back toward an egalitarian tendency.)
<BR>
If I start to earn well, I pay `more than my fair share'. I suspect it
<BR>
tends to even out over the course of a lifetime, except for the hopeless
<BR>
and the leeches. Providing for the hopeless in this way seems likely to be
<BR>
efficient, if the paperwork is kept to a minimum (as I think it is in Oz).
<BR>
Letting some leeches get a free ride is part of the wastage expectable and
<BR>
allowable in accounting for any large industrial system, since it would
<BR>
cost more to track them down or force them into petty crime.
<BR>
<P>Max was offended (on an adjacent thread, I think) that I spoke of extrope
<BR>
kneejerk responses to such claims as this. Sorry if that seemed uncalled
<BR>
for. I meant `reflex', `automatic shorthand', not `brainless', of course.
<BR>
We all use such shortcuts in discourse, and hence my qualms about venturing
<BR>
into `the basics' again. Let sacred cows lie. :)
