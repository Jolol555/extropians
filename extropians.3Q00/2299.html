<EM>&gt;I think the idea is very interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and definitely worth exploring further.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;One point that I would be interested in seeing discussed in the paper is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether this system of decision-making is often used in corporations, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it isn't, what is the reason? Is it the case that nobody has thought of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing things this way before (which would be surprising, given that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are so many companies around involved in fierce competition, and a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people trying to think of better forms of management)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Management is a technology, and technology improves.  So I think the answer
<BR>
is both that people haven't thought of doing this, and that it just recently
<BR>
got a lot cheaper to do this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A corporation would seem to provide a nice prototype
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;test-bed for this approach,
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;would it be possible for Robin to get a patent on it?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Too late - the ideas have been published for more than a year.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;On a smaller point: Robin says (p. 29) that one should not require markets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to agree on a proposal for too long a period before it can be officially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approved, because &quot;Otherwise speculators early in the period may worry that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speculators later in the period will know substantially more, and bias their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;estimates thereby.&quot; It's not clear to me why this would be a problem, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what the bias referred to would be.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was intended to be a non-technical paper, and I don't know of a way
<BR>
to explain it that isn't technical, beyond what I already said.
