</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let me throw in my two cents here, I am glad for you that you no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; longer have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to live a lie. That must have been hellish.
</EM><BR>
<P>And my $.02 as well--I'd be interested to know, Eliezer, if you find that
<BR>
your intellectual work comes more easily to you now that you've freed
<BR>
yourself from the burden of satisfying your family.
<BR>
<P>Like you, Eliezer, I began to question religion at around the age of 5.  My
<BR>
father was not religious, but my mother was, and insisted on taking my
<BR>
brother and me to Christian churches. There we were told, among other
<BR>
things, that non-Christians were destined to spend eternity in Hell. The
<BR>
self-righteous attitudes of the church people had always made me
<BR>
uncomfortable, but before the age of 5, I'd thought there was something
<BR>
wrong with ME rather than with the church people. When I was 5 years old my
<BR>
family moved to a new neighborhood where I became &quot;best friends&quot; with a
<BR>
Jewish girl of my own age. That was a turning point for me, because I spent
<BR>
quite a lot of time with this girl and her family and came to see that they
<BR>
were good people--as good as or better than my own family.  The idea that my
<BR>
friend was destined to spend eternity in Hell simply because she'd been born
<BR>
into a Jewish family was so preposterous that it shifted my whole outlook on
<BR>
life.  From my new viewpoint, I could easily reject all the teachings of the
<BR>
Christian church.  I consider myself very lucky to have gone through this
<BR>
turning point at such an early age, because it forced me to formulate my own
<BR>
code of ethics.
<BR>
<P>I'd be interested to compare notes with others who found it necessary to
<BR>
create a philosophical base from which to operate as children.  I can
<BR>
remember as a teenager feeling isolated from my peers, and I think one of
<BR>
the reasons for this was that I was operating from a self-formulated code of
<BR>
ethics while most of them were using the same ready-made one.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; As a matter of fact.. now that I think of it: Most of my friends who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jewish are not at all religious, and most flat out call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves atheist,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and very 'out of the closet&quot; about it. When they say they are Jewish they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean the ethnicity, not the spiritual practice.
</EM><BR>
<P>Same thing with my Jewish friends, most of whom cherish their Jewish
<BR>
heritage while rejecting the religious element.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Like being African American or Native American. Is this a strange
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomenon?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think it's strange.  People have a need to belong to a group. Maybe
<BR>
this is at the root of racism. I remember once when I was a white kid in
<BR>
1960's Texas.  The racist atmosphere at that time was was bad.  As I
<BR>
mentioned above, I'd come up with my own code of ethics and had seen no
<BR>
reason to classify people according to skin color, so I was oblivious to
<BR>
that distinction (this seems odd, looking back from a wider perspective, but
<BR>
it was so.  I can recall once going into a &quot;colored&quot; restaurant--yes, they
<BR>
had segregated restaurants back then--and not noticing.  The friend I was
<BR>
with said, &quot;Um, Barbara [my name given at birth], I'm not very hungry.&quot;
<BR>
&quot;What do you mean you're not hungry?  I thought you said you were starving.&quot;
<BR>
at which point she took my arm and dragged me out).  The day I first became
<BR>
aware of belonging to groups came when I was 15 or 16. My white friend and I
<BR>
were visiting a small town around 60 miles from Houston, and we met a couple
<BR>
of girls who were listening to James Brown on the radio, and dancing.  We
<BR>
got into a discussion of various blues musicians, and the girls were showing
<BR>
us a new dance, and it got late.  I offered the girls a ride home, which
<BR>
they accepted.  There were 2 white boys in a pickup truck nearby, and one of
<BR>
them yelled to me, &quot;Hey!  Don't give them damn niggers a ride.&quot;  At that
<BR>
moment, I felt as though I belonged with these girls, and I had a sudden
<BR>
glimpse of what it would feel like to be part of a tight group of people.
<BR>
Having glimpsed it, I always felt a sort of lack in my own life after that
<BR>
moment.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I'm in favor of letting go of things that shackle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sometimes the hardest part is identifying those things which shackle you.
<BR>
It seems that so many of those shackles clicked shut way back in childhood.
<BR>
I've been lucky enough to work with a highly skilled and empathetic
<BR>
therapist (we used to barter legal services in exchange for therapy) who
<BR>
helped me to use age-regression techniques to ferret out some of the
<BR>
childhood trash that was still hanging on. Unfortunately, therapists of this
<BR>
quality seem to be one in a million.
