<P>As you point out, until recently, I was in sad straits.  Presently, I'm
<BR>
metamorphosing into a Research Fellow of the Singularity Institute for
<BR>
Artificial Intelligence, an institution that would probably not exist if
<BR>
I had not published the aforesaid Web pages (CaTAI in particular).  So
<BR>
we do have one noncopyright strategy; publish work that's important
<BR>
enough and maybe someone will pay you to keep doing it.
<BR>
<P>Strictly speaking, neither your objection nor my answer has any
<BR>
relevance to the main point - regardless of who &quot;really&quot; supported
<BR>
CaTAI, it wasn't being supported by pay-per-view.  Spike said that
<BR>
nobody would publish good stuff without per-item royalties, and I
<BR>
pointed out that at least one counterexample exists.  Whether this is
<BR>
the exception that demonstrates the rule is another issue.  Who knows,
<BR>
maybe once copyright is dead, the world's entire literature will consist
<BR>
of books written by wealthy scions and retired dot-commers and
<BR>
sixteen-year-old high school students.  Would this world really be any
<BR>
worse than the one we have now?  Damien Broderick is fortunate and
<BR>
*rare* in being able to make a living at skiffy (sci-fi); yet the very
<BR>
existence of SF magazines depends on the constant influx of new writers
<BR>
with day jobs, most of whom invest amounts of time far out of proportion
<BR>
to that final check.  Writing short stories doesn't pay - writing novels
<BR>
does - and yet people still write short stories.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; just pointing out that your empirical evidence is not especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; representative of the way most artists need to make a living from their work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I believe I said as much in my original message (&quot;you can't run an
<BR>
industry that way&quot;).
