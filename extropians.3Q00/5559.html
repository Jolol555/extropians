<P>
It's so seldom I get a chance to contribute meaningfully to the conversation
<BR>
here, but let me jump in...
<BR>
<P>I think the relevant image here was of an AI carrying on an optimal
<BR>
conversation with a human being by testing it's repsonses against a trillion
<BR>
high fidelity simulations of that human, during the time it took the human
<BR>
to draw a breath.
<BR>
<P>You cannot win a negotiation against something that quite rightly views you
<BR>
as a deterministic process.
<BR>
<P>I believe Eliezer is alluding to the the difficulty of indentifying with a
<BR>
mind that is that much closer to a force_of_nature then any mere unaugmented
<BR>
human ever can or ever will be.
