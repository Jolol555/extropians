<EM>&gt; &gt; Thus, a philosophically naive person, thru his or her willingness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; such nonsense as part of the &quot;training,&quot; could easilly lose all grip on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reality as we know it, at least on a cognitive level.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I think they
<BR>
<EM>&gt;even kicked him out of the church when he asked for his money back, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;though he'd been so shabbily treated, his greatest desire seemed to be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get back into the Church.  It was quite pathetic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't think the CoS is any worse than other religions, but all religions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have the potential of being deadly, and this one seems more dangerous than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;many others because it's on the rise, in its fanatic stage rather than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a mature religion.

BTW, anyone heard of or from Laurence Gale lately?  He was one of the 
<BR>
original founders of Alcor (originally Manrise), quite  smart guy.  Then he 
<BR>
disappeared as far as I've heard - nothing since the mid-80's.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, reason I thot of Laurence:  He was once fairly high up in the 
<BR>
Dianetics Org in England, had gone &quot;clear&quot; long before, was an auditor.  
<BR>
Then he returned to the U.S. and introduced himself to the U.S. local 
<BR>
scientology organization, where they informed him, after standard testing, 
<BR>
that he had all kinds of engrams, etc., and would have to start over from 
<BR>
zero.  He decided that this pretty well demonstrated that any claim to 
<BR>
scientific validity on their part had been reduced to near zero and left 
<BR>
instead.
