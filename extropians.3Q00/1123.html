<EM>&gt; An essay published in the San jose Mercury News (originally written for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Washington Post) asks some questions abotu genetic engineering {. . .}.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.sjmercury.com/premium/opinion/columns/071850.htm">http://www.sjmercury.com/premium/opinion/columns/071850.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>This article (by Tom Delbanco) was mentioned here in the last few days in
<BR>
the thread [SOC/MED: Washington Post article calling for &quot;Genome
<BR>
Commission&quot;].  Look at the way in which it approaches the issues.
<BR>
Paragraph after paragraph of handwringing without any consideration of the
<BR>
positive potential of the technology, the fact that the rest of the world
<BR>
does not stand still, or freedom of personal choice.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If genetic therapies that increase life expectancy arrived tomorrow,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they might bankrupt our health-care system or siphon vital resources
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from education, human services and other essential functions of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;society.  Are we ready to deal with this kind of success?
<BR>
<P>Well, all right.  So let's just forget about genetics technology, then.
<BR>
People might actually live a lot longer.  But that's all right---we can
<BR>
just let them die.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And consider the next step: full-blown eugenics.  In today's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;narcissistic society, people aspire increasingly to their notion of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfection: the cherished height, gender, skin color.  How will we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build moral consensus, a code that stymies those who would create a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;master race or a Frankenstein?
<BR>
<P>Eugenics, of course, is going to be one of the big hypewords.  Delbanco
<BR>
does not hesitate in launching into an attack on the notion that people
<BR>
might actually choose their own or their children's physical
<BR>
characteristics.  It's a problem that this sort of attack can appear mainly
<BR>
on the accusation of being [narcissistic] and not look preposterous.
<BR>
<P>This code that he calls for is not a polite suggestion from Miss Manners:
<BR>
it is supposed to be effective in extinguishing what sounds like personal
<BR>
choice.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about the anguish of those deciding whether to learn if they or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their children have genes that forecast Huntington's disease, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the likelihood of breast cancer or dementia.
<BR>
<P>Think about the anguish of knowing that there is a problem that you might
<BR>
be able to prevent or solve.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflect on the uncertainties that already attend the relatively
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;primitive genetic tests that amniocentesis offers the pregnant woman
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and multiply those dilemmas a thousandfold.
<BR>
<P>Reflect on the uncertainties that attend people not knowing anything.  With
<BR>
more sophisticated genetic tests you increase your certainty as to whether
<BR>
there is a problem or not.  So what Delbanco is really concerned about is
<BR>
having decisions to make---or maybe the fact that the knowledge and
<BR>
decisions are available.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will we feel when fantasies of genetic perfection are destroyed?
<BR>
<P>Since when do people think that their genes are perfect?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning about one's genetic map may induce far more pain than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasure.
<BR>
<P>All right, then, don't ask.  We won't tell you.  Just stay out of our way.
<BR>
This myth that learning something about yourself only ruins your life
<BR>
should have been killed centuries ago.  If we didn't learn these things
<BR>
we'd be back living in muddy caves and wondering whether or not we should
<BR>
use fire.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it {genetic determinism} stop our search for mystery, community,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art, spirituality and the deepest pleasures?  Will the genetic map
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace the dream?
<BR>
<P>Yep.  Once we learn something important about the world we just stop
<BR>
everything and stand around, staring at the ground.  You've never noticed
<BR>
everyone else doing that?
<BR>
<P><P>These comments don't deserve much more than sarcasm.
