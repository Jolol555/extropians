<EM>&gt; to one mp3 with Metallica in its name-- but it wasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even one off any of their albums, just a remix of one

<EM>&gt; of their songs a friend of mine did. I had even been

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulled out that lawsuit and ban stuff-- so much for

<EM>&gt; that! :) IMHO any profits they've lost have been from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that baaaad move, not from Napster itself! :)

<P>Who Metallica should really fear is not Napster, but the
<BR>
garage band that has just as much talent as Metallica,
<BR>
and hasn't been spoiled by royalties. The band whose
<BR>
bread and butter is playing live gigs, and their recordings
<BR>
are just a way to make a name for themselves. Such a band
<BR>
would simply love to have Metallica's problem of severah
<BR>
hundred thousand users downloading and listening to their
<BR>
songs. Because the next time this garage band comes to town,
<BR>
it will fill a stadium with people who first found out about
<BR>
them by downloading their MP3's. That's the once and future
<BR>
business model for music, folks.
