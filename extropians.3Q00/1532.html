Anyone maybe interested?

<BR>
A friend and I have been talking about creating a game for a long time.  We
<BR>
are both coders,  and i am also a network administrator / webmaster.  We've
<BR>
recently been discussing how to implement novel approaches to an 'AI combat
<BR>
strategy engine', since we lack the funding to go all out.  I have played
<BR>
online multiplayer games like Ultima Online and Diablo (both fantasy
<BR>
oriented), and conclude that there is definitely a market for it.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I've also watched some interesting events emerge - such as persons selling
<BR>
virtual comodities (virtual characters, virtual objects, virtual currency,
<BR>
and virtual real estate) on eBay for hundreds or even thousands of real
<BR>
dollars.  I have another friend who makes a living as a 'virtual comodities
<BR>
broker'.  He developed a superior money-making strategy in the game, and
<BR>
sells money by the millions, and rare virtual objects, on ebay.  He doesn't
<BR>
go 'into the office,'  he works from home, doing what he loves - playing
<BR>
video games, and the game actually supports his lifestyle.  My heart aches
<BR>
for the folks at Origin who have to balance the virtual economy with him
<BR>
around...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The only drawback i anticipate is that once a game of this nature goes
<BR>
online, it seems like it must be supported virtually forever - suggesting
<BR>
that mechanisms for efficient augmentation and evolution of the game need to
<BR>
be built into the infastructure from the getgo, and considered in all
<BR>
aspects of design and implementation.  Prepare to have a massive development
<BR>
team, and a massive customer support team.  And most of all, prepare to be
<BR>
in it for the long haul.  Well, unless some mega game co. comes along and
<BR>
buys you out for mega bucks...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
One problem i observe in these games as they are now, judging from consumer
<BR>
response, is that creating a world and mechanisms for character development
<BR>
and cooperation is not enough.  A game of this nature should have a team
<BR>
dedicated to creating a continuous flow of 'quest' events - there needs be
<BR>
perhaps one major plot line and several subplots happening all of the time
<BR>
to keep the society dynamic.  Evolving circumstances could introduce
<BR>
variance in what players consider 'optimal phenotypes' over time, to use
<BR>
that example, encouraging replayability of the game.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
And if this is to be done properly, it is going to be expensive.  Software
<BR>
development costs aside, it will be necessary to build servers all over the
<BR>
world to support a global user base.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
But, I suspect that if someone were to build a game around the ideology of
<BR>
transhumanism, what we would have is a very powerful 'meme vector'. For
<BR>
example, have intrinsic features of the game include: gradual genetic
<BR>
manipulation of their characters to evolve interesting phenotypes (and of
<BR>
course, life extension) in a stepwise fashion (towards a dynamic 'optimum'
<BR>
rather than a static one), and cybernetic/bionic implants.  The scope of the
<BR>
game would include multiple planets and therefore space travel.  Player
<BR>
characters can be 'saved' by cryonic suspension.  We could even make it
<BR>
possible for two or more players to direct their characters' evolution such
<BR>
that they could 'merge' into a meta character, introducing all sorts of
<BR>
interesting possibilities, but mostly cooperation. I could go on and on.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Hehe,
<BR>
We could hire Elizier to develop the finer aspects of the NPCs
<BR>
(non-player-characters) 'personalities' and strategies.  Then he'd actually
<BR>
be working on AI and refining the game at the same time.  I bet every one of
<BR>
you folks could contribute in a similar fashion.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Cheers,
<BR>
