following:
<BR>
<P>The writer, Mr. Formenti, says that extropianism is a
<BR>
cyber-anarchic-religious movement. Religious ? That¹s because extropians aim
<BR>
at some deity (or some Buddhity). What is this omega-point-deity ?
<BR>
<P><P>It seems that Mr. Formenti is mixed up. The Omega Point reference is to
<BR>
Frank Tipler's Omega Point Theory as explained in his book &quot;The Physics of
<BR>
Immortality.&quot; Tipler is a Transhumanist and a professor of mathematical
<BR>
physics at Tulane University. There is a little info about him on his web
<BR>
page (linked through the Transhumanist page) but I would recommend reading
<BR>
Anders Sandberg's thoughtful analysis of the Omega Point Theory and related
<BR>
ideas on his web site: <A HREF="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/">http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Omega/</A>
