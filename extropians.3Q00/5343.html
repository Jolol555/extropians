<P>In Another Coup For Carbon Nanotubes, Penn Scientists Find The Tiny Cylinders 
<BR>
Of Pure Carbon May Top All Other Known Materials In Heat Conduction 
<BR>
<P>PHILADELPHIA -- New research from the University of Pennsylvania indicates 
<BR>
that carbon nanotubes, filaments of pure carbon less than one ten-thousandth 
<BR>
the width of a human hair, may be the best heat-conducting material man has 
<BR>
ever known. The findings suggest that these exotic strands, already heralded 
<BR>
for their unparalleled strength and unique ability to adopt the electrical 
<BR>
properties of either semiconductors or perfect metals, may someday also find 
<BR>
applications as miniature heat conduits in a host of devices and materials. 
<BR>
A Penn team led by materials scientist John E. Fischer, Ph.D., and physicist 
<BR>
Alan T. Johnson, Ph.D., offers these first details on carbon nanotubes' 
<BR>
thermal properties in a paper appearing in the Sept. 8 issue of the journal 
<BR>
Science. 
<BR>
<P>For some time, scientists have been intrigued by carbon nanotubes, pure 
<BR>
carbon cylinders with walls just one atom thick. First created a decade ago 
<BR>
by zapping graphite with lasers, the structures have become one of the 
<BR>
marvels of the nanotechnology world -- 100 times as strong as steel and 
<BR>
capable of far greater electrical conductivity than other carbon-based 
<BR>
materials. Researchers have envisioned the miniature strands bulking up 
<BR>
brittle plastics and conducting current in ever-smaller electrical circuits, 
<BR>
among dozens of other possibilities. 
<BR>
<P>Carbon nanotubes' newfound ability to conduct heat suggests applications far 
<BR>
beyond those that call on their strength and electrical conductivity, said 
<BR>
Dr. Johnson, an assistant professor of physics at Penn. As computing power 
<BR>
has skyrocketed, the infinitesimal heat generated by each circuit on a 
<BR>
microchip has proved a headache for computer designers and manufacturers, who 
<BR>
have few ways to dissipate the considerable heat that results from millions 
<BR>
of circuits operating in tandem. Next-generation computer designs might 
<BR>
circumvent this problem with judiciously placed carbon nanotubes to direct 
<BR>
heat away from sensitive circuitry. 
<BR>
<P>Similarly, carbon nanotubes used as heat sinks in electric motors could allow 
<BR>
for the introduction of plastic parts that might otherwise melt under the 
<BR>
motors' intense heat. The tiny structures could also be embedded in materials 
<BR>
regularly called upon to withstand extreme heat, such as those that form the 
<BR>
exterior panels of airplanes and rockets. 
<BR>
<P>Heat energy in nanotubes is carried by sound waves; in materials that are 
<BR>
optimal conductors of heat, these waves move very rapidly in an essentially 
<BR>
one-dimensional direction. Drs. Fischer and Johnson found that sound waves 
<BR>
bearing thermal energy travel straight down individual carbon nanotubes at 
<BR>
roughly 10,000 meters per second, behavior consistent with superior thermal 
<BR>
conductivity. But they also unexpectedly determined that even when carbon 
<BR>
nanotubes are bundled together -- like individual filaments welded together 
<BR>
into the giant cables that support suspension bridges -- the bonds between 
<BR>
the individual nanotubes remain so weak that heat essentially doesn't 
<BR>
transcend them. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Scientists had predicted that two-dimensional or three-dimensional arrays of 
<BR>
carbon nanotubes would permit the sound waves carrying heat to scatter in all 
<BR>
directions, greatly reducing thermal conductivity,&quot; said Dr. Fischer, a 
<BR>
professor of materials science and engineering in Penn's Laboratory for 
<BR>
Research on the Structure of Matter. &quot;Our experiments showed that even within 
<BR>
bundles of nanotubes, sound waves remain remarkably one-dimensional.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The sound waves don't fan out and dissipate because the bonds between 
<BR>
nanotubes in a bundle are so weak,&quot; Dr. Johnson said. &quot;In terms of bonding 
<BR>
strength, you can think of nanotubes in a bundle almost like dried spaghetti 
<BR>
sliding freely back and forth when you shake its box.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Ironically, the same weak linkages that make carbon nanotubes superior for 
<BR>
heat conductance could deflate scientists' earlier expectation that bun-dles 
<BR>
of them would provide unrivaled mechanical strength. While the individual 
<BR>
nanotubes are extremely strong, the weak bonding Drs. Fischer and Johnson 
<BR>
observed between nanotubes would need to be overcome to translate this 
<BR>
strength to a thicker structure. 
<BR>
<P><P>Drs. Fischer and Johnson were joined in the research by James Hone, a former 
<BR>
Penn postdoctoral researcher now at the California Institute of Technology; 
<BR>
Bertram Batlogg of Lucent Technologies; and Zdenek Benes, a Penn graduate 
<BR>
student. The work was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the 
<BR>
U.S. Department of Energy.
