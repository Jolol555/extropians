<EM>&gt; &gt; modified  organisms
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You made the initial comparison with H-bombs ...... I only point out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the dangers are more subtle and we should tread carefully.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I compared YOUR fears and level of alarmism to similar levels of
<BR>
alarmism
<BR>
about nuclear power and nuclear war. I did NOT compare GM to H-bombs. Please
<BR>
re-read what I posted.
<BR>
<P>Sellafield, three mile island, chernobyl .... need i go on? surely the
<BR>
&quot;alarmist&quot; fears about nuclear power have been born out?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It is more like a forest fire, which it is possible to fight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and contain and eliminate (much as we have eliminated smallpox and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;diseases).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but even forest fires are harmful .... and aren't some diseases (TB?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that were once thought to have been eliminated fighting back?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;They fight back where people don't actually give them a good fight.
</EM><BR>
Resistant TB
<BR>
<EM>&gt;strains evolved specifically because people with TB, in their
</EM><BR>
characteristic
<BR>
<EM>&gt;lack of attention to detail, stopped taking the antibiotics when they
</EM><BR>
started
<BR>
<EM>&gt;feeling better, rather than completing the entire regimen of antibiotics as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instructed by their doctors.
</EM><BR>
<P>But unlike forest fires &amp; disesases .... we are deliberately introducing GM
<BR>
strains into the environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are no remote mountains or whatever in the UK that can be freed of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bees, even if there might be in the States. But surely other insects move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pollen about as well as bees?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;None do to the same extent, though butterflies are pretty good, and
</EM><BR>
hummingbirds
<BR>
<EM>&gt;are also, but these do not deal with corn. Corn's overwhelmingly primary
</EM><BR>
method
<BR>
<EM>&gt;of pollination is by wind.
</EM><BR>
<P>So the safety of tests *can't* be guaranteed then?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, so you question the motives of &quot;greenies&quot; who may have left-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; politics. But for sure the motives of Monsanto and the big agri-businesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pushing this GM thru as fast they can *ARE* motivated solely by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-interest and financial gain.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is your reply to this point?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What is permaculture?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately there aren't big agri bucks to be made out permaculture ....
<BR>
although apparently NY city could be self-sufficient in food if it was
<BR>
introduced in the city limits! Its real benefits would be if introduced in
<BR>
developing countries, but isn't an instant fix, takes a while to establish
<BR>
... but after that, easy street.
<BR>
