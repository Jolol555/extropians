<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;Spudboy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Given that Hitler was a socialist how is it he was also a capitalist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you define that term capitalist?  I am confused.

<EM>&gt; Ron! Please do not be decieved by the name National Socialist. My guess is that the Party name Nationalist Party, founded immediately after WW1 and also a Racist-Nordic myth party, funded by the autocrats and the industrial chieftans--their leader, if I remember correctly was Hugenburg. The National Socialists had nothing to do with socialism (despite the many flaws of socialism) it was just a way of packaging their hatreds while avoiding the &quot;copyright infringements&quot; of the larger competing racist, National Party. Hitler loaded his pockets down and was a capitalist in the sense that he wanted to make a profit. He was absolutely not a free-enterprise capitalist. The shopkeepers that supported him were also capitalists too. Hope this helps.

<P>However, your statement is incredibly wrong. The one eyewitness source on the
<BR>
Third Reich to be published was Albert Speer, author of _Inside the Third
<BR>
Reich_. He makes it quite clear that the Nazis were in fact quite socialist, and
<BR>
that they did nationalize quite a few companies (most notably jewish owned
<BR>
companies) as well as Volkwagen, and the Hermann Goering Works was founded as a
<BR>
socialist enterprise from the start. Moreover, Speer states that the top echelon
<BR>
was quite enthusiastic about Hitlers post-war plans for 'Germania', which would
<BR>
be a europe wide socialist state. They were holding off on widespread
<BR>
restructuring of the economy from its mercantilist/socialist hodgepodge to a
<BR>
fully socialist economy till after the war was won by Germany. Many top Nazis
<BR>
would often comment how much their policies had in common with communism and
<BR>
that they were of the opinion that the best Nazis were often ex-communists.
<BR>
<P>Hitler himself was NOT a capitalist, as I've said previously. He actually,
<BR>
according to Speer, lived quite modestly. Goering and Bormann were the two big
<BR>
looters (and were not capitalists either), who would as a matter of practice
<BR>
force industrialists to pay them big kickbacks on government contracts,
<BR>
appropriate state funds, equipment, and land for personal use.
