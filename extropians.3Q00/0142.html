<EM>&gt;I'm sure everyone is finding this discussion as numbing as I, although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perhaps for different reasons. Still, I feel obliged to make a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;points:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The `unreal' or `coercive' service (publicly funded) is clearly of benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to *everyone* since:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the rich, as I noted (at least in Australia, maybe not elsewhere) often use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their access to large tax-funded hospitals and their specialised machines,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;staff, etc;
</EM><BR>
<P>But they have the choice, others don't
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;doctors tend to be trained in these hospitals, and in Oz at least they get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their education at public universities;
</EM><BR>
<P>Because the state often maintains a monopoly on education too
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;late industrial civilisation benefits immensely by having almost all its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citizens reasonably healthy, immunized,  ready for work and not falling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about in the street, which is perhaps best ensured by health services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;readily available to everyone--just as it is sensible to have as many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people as possible able to read, count, calculate and wipe their arses, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just those whose parents are prepared and able to pay for instilling these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;skills on a private basis (even if that is a better way to go for those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can and are willing to do so).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Damien Broderick
</EM><BR>
<P>What a bizarre argument!
<BR>
<P>You're saying that the only thing that keeps us from falling into barbarism 
<BR>
is the public sector. That no such things as health care or education would 
<BR>
exist, or woek, on a private market. That people are too weak, stupid and 
<BR>
evil to understand their own best, and value such things. One might wonder 
<BR>
how it comes that people seem so smart in order to make these choices when 
<BR>
it comes other goods or services, that are equally important as health care 
<BR>
or education.
<BR>
<P>Following your assumption, one cannot condone transhumanism. Since obviously 
<BR>
people are not able to make these rather simple choices about their lives 
<BR>
today, they cannot possibly make the immensly more difficult choices about 
<BR>
the questions asked by transhumanism tomorrow.
