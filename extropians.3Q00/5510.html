<EM>&gt; There was a tribe of protohumans in the valley. Protohuman Mac finds a nice 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chunk of chert (flint), hard to find in the valley. Previously, protohuman 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Joe had the only chunk of chert in the valley and he was going to trade it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the semi-rancid gazelle carcass that some other protohuman had found, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and with that, he was going to lure that comely female protohuman Velma into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bushes, and thereby pass on his genes. But now, with his bigger chunk of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chert, Mac gets to pass on his genes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you think Joe, if he were not able to get the chert himself, would have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told Mac where it was? Velma womb is the limited resources here, ultimately.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a somewhat artificial example, because it only applies to Joe.
<BR>
For most of the people in the valley, it would be beneficial for there
<BR>
to be two flint owners rather than one.  As it is they must go to Joe
<BR>
to get flint, making it expensive.  With two flint owners it will cost
<BR>
much less due to the competition.
<BR>
<P>Since there are many more non flint owners than flint owners in the
<BR>
valley in this example, most people by this argument should support
<BR>
expanding the pool flint, even if someone else gets it.
<BR>
<P>In the more general case, if you have an economy with many forms of
<BR>
wealth and you have a degree of specialization, only a minority will
<BR>
have their wealth concentrated in any particular commodity.  Adding more
<BR>
of that commodity will be a net benefit for everyone except those who
<BR>
have their wealth disproportionately concentrated in that commodity.
<BR>
This will be a majority of the people.
