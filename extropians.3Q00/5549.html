<EM>&gt; You're the only person to have explicitly stated you'd give more than abillion

<EM>&gt; - two people went up to that point then stopped there.  I'll state

<EM>&gt; here for the record that I'd give it to them regardless of the amount as

<EM>&gt; well.

<P>Just so you're not alone: I, too, would say yes regardless of amount.
<BR>
As was said, since the alternative is that the resources/whatever
<BR>
remain undiscovered (and thus, practically nonexistant), then this is
<BR>
the equivalent of asking, &quot;Do you want a billion dollars injected into
<BR>
the world economy that otherwise would never be injected?&quot;  Like *duh*
<BR>
someone's going to start out in charge of it; it just happens that one
<BR>
person will start out, rather than spreading this.
<BR>
<P>As for the &quot;recipient will never know I was responsible&quot;...well, I could
<BR>
certainly *claim* I was responsible, but I've got absolutely no proof.
<BR>
Therefore, the recipient can't ever know for sure that I was the source,
<BR>
even if I claimed to be.  (And for a totally random stranger...what am I
<BR>
gonna do, show up on vis doorstep and pronounce that ve got rich because
<BR>
of something I said, so would ve give me a chunk of vis money please?)
