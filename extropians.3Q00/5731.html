Eugene Leitl writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Children are surprisingly efficient disruptors of mental processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (well, perhaps less surprising, since being information vampires). It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is perhaps not so hard for parents, who are flooded with endogenous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; euphorica, since smitten with their offspring, but that couple did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complain a bit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could digital equivalents or simulations of endogenous euphorica (or hormonal
<BR>
triggers) in AIs insure that they will be smitten with their parents (i.e., feel
<BR>
compelled to love and befriend their creators)? This mechanism would be useful
<BR>
when developing AI that can predict market trends, because we don't want the AI
<BR>
to be motivated by any analogs of human greed (which, after all, precipitated
<BR>
the creation of the AI).

<P>.. Any resemblance between the above views and those of my employer,
<BR>
my terminal, or the view out my window are purely coincidental.  Any
<BR>
resemblance between the above and my own views is non-deterministic.
<BR>
The question of the existence of views in the absence of anyone to hold
<BR>
them is left as an exercise for the reader.  The question of the
<BR>
existence of the reader is left as an exercise for the second god
<BR>
coefficient.  (A discussion of non-orthogonal, non-integral polytheism
<BR>
is beyond the scope of this article.)   -- fortune
