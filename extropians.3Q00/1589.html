<EM>&gt; &gt; I know it's been tossed about before, but I'm wondering if the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computer geeky extros might like to put together a TH game? Between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those with coding skills, artists, musicians, and game design talent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (anders, that's you), we've got the right people. I know none of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has a lot of time, but together maybe we can make something. I'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thinking an opensource project (via sourceforge). I'm sure I contacted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someone here about doing a game some time ago, and never followed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (sorry). If there were a few of us, we'd all be comitted (to each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That sounds like a great idea - I'd love to see what you have in mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps the first thing to do is get setup at sourceforge: That'll give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you a place to start posting some ideas, and set up a couple of discussion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lists to get some brainstorming going. If you're doing something exciting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd be interested in getting involved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'm not at that stage yet at all. I thought we could benefit from
<BR>
doing what we do best on this list for a while; gasbagging. We'll see if
<BR>
something comes of it. No rush.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've been interested, on and off, in some sort of distributed mud-like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system. I'd like, for instance, to be able to walk through a door and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seamlessly be talking to another server. Or manipulate objects whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior is being computed on another machine somewhere else. You'd figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out some system where by objects (a stove, a book, etc.) declare the ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which they can be manipulated (open, close, read, etc.), along with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verb mappings, then anyone can drop new objects in, run it's innards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anywhere, and let people play with it. Some sort of Corba'ish/RMI deal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a cool idea. I've got ideas about an object-oriented combat system
<BR>
(and other system) where everything is defined in terms of a few base
<BR>
abilities, and new abilities/skills/objects override those abilities with
<BR>
more specialised versions;
<BR>
<P>For instance, you might have a (very simple) combat system defined in terms
<BR>
of BaseAttack and BaseDefense abilities; they have some scores associated,
<BR>
and there is some algorithm for conducting battle using them. However, your
<BR>
nano-samurai might wield a katana, and might have a skill called Katana,
<BR>
which is a specialisation of a skill called Long Swords, which is a
<BR>
specialisation of a skill called Swords, which is a specialisation of a
<BR>
skill called Melee Weapons, which finally is a specialisation of BaseAttack.
<BR>
Each specialisation would add more weird side effects, modify a base score,
<BR>
and determine things like the cost to acquire the skill. Also, specialised
<BR>
versions would introduce restrictions; ie: to use &quot;Katana&quot; skill, you must
<BR>
actually be holding a Katana.
<BR>
<P>This idea can be mapped onto a verb system; some of the verbs are understood
<BR>
by the system, and the system itself uses them in various ways.
