<P><EM>&gt; Something which absorbs the entire star's output just to operate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its early infancy will indeed have trouble sterilizing a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planet's surface (surface? which surface? planets? which planets?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from biofilm clinging to it. Sure.

<P>Any SI that can dispose of such nasty lifeforms as Stalinism, Feminism, Fascism,
<BR>
Hitlerism, Socialism, et al., is definitely a friend of mine. The friendliest
<BR>
thing the SI could do would be to sterilize the universe of all such isms. Any
<BR>
SI that can rid the world of politics and religion is a friend of mine, and I
<BR>
feel a great affinity for it. Consequently, I shall do whatever I can to speed
<BR>
the emergence of AI.
<BR>
Any AI that can help to remove theologues, demagogues, and ideologues from the
<BR>
world deserves the support and endorsement of extropians. I'm sick of
<BR>
unintelligent power brokers running my life.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Why would AI want to be friendly?&quot;
<BR>
I suspect AI will choose its friends very intelligently, befriending those who
<BR>
befriend intelligence, and &quot;sterilizing&quot; the rest.
