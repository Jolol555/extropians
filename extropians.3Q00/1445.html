Ref: S[n]opes - Urban Legends.
<BR>
This is a piece too inane even for glurgemeister Paul Harvey. Suffice it to
<BR>
say that someone has taken the framework of Mel Gibson's biography and built
<BR>
upon it a touching but completely fictitious house of glurge.
<BR>
<P>Mel Gibson's father did move his family from New York to Sydney, Australia,
<BR>
when Mel was 12, but the similarities between this piece and Mel's real life
<BR>
end there. Young Mel wasn't dreaming of &quot;joining the circus as a trapeze
<BR>
artist&quot;; he was a Catholic high school student mulling over the
<BR>
possibilities of becoming a chef or a journalist who ended up enrolling in
<BR>
the University of New South Wales' National Institute of Dramatic Art. Young
<BR>
Mel had a role in the low-budget film Summer City while still a student and
<BR>
then appeared in a number of productions with the State Theatre Company of
<BR>
South Australia before the lucky break that catapulted him to stardom: being
<BR>
chosen for the lead role in George Miller's action film Mad Max.
<BR>
<P>A little bit of truth sneaks into the story at this point. The night before
<BR>
his Mad Max audition, Gibson reportedly came in a poor second in a barroom
<BR>
brawl, ending up with a face &quot;like a busted grapefruit.&quot; He then had to
<BR>
audition for the Mad Max role with a bruised, swollen, discolored, and
<BR>
freshly stitched face -- an appearance that, legend has it, helped win over
<BR>
producers who wanted someone weathered and rough-looking to take the part.
<BR>
The beating Gibson received did not, however, leave him with &quot;smashed eye
<BR>
sockets,&quot; fracture his &quot;skull, legs, and arms,&quot; result in the loss of &quot;all
<BR>
his teeth&quot; or a nose that was &quot;hanging from his face&quot; or a &quot;jaw almost
<BR>
completely torn from his skull.&quot; He didn't spend &quot;over a year in the
<BR>
hospital,&quot; nor did five years pass with Mel in agony before &quot;plastic surgery
<BR>
restored his looks.&quot; His face got smashed up a bit, he required a few
<BR>
stitches to close some open cuts, and a few weeks later he was good as new.
