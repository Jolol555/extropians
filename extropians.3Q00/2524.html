<P>$45 Million Grant Awarded to Buy Supercomputer 
<BR>
<P>by JOHN MARKOFF
<BR>
he National Science Foundation announced yesterday that it had made a $45 
<BR>
million award to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to buy what will be the 
<BR>
world's fastest nonmilitary supercomputer when it is completely installed 
<BR>
next year, Compaq, the computer's maker, said. 
<BR>
<P>The award, which was announced Thursday in Washington after the foundation 
<BR>
reviewed proposals from five competition scientific centers, is intended to 
<BR>
reinvigorate the nation's civilian computational science resources, which 
<BR>
have increasingly fallen behind the resources available to the military in 
<BR>
recent years. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The general perception is that we're under-resourced when compared to the 
<BR>
military programs,&quot; said Robert Borchers, division director of the advanced 
<BR>
computational infrastructure and research division of the National Science 
<BR>
Foundation. 
<BR>
<P>The military has been spending heavily on supercomputing as part of the 
<BR>
Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative, which is intended to insure the 
<BR>
nation's nuclear weapons stockpile maintains its effectiveness during the 
<BR>
nuclear testing treaty that bans weapons testing. 
<BR>
<P>The announcement is likely to shake up the supercomputer industry. The other 
<BR>
two major competitors were machines designed by I.B.M. and Intel, who have 
<BR>
recently been the most powerful forces in the supercomputer industry. Now, 
<BR>
however, Compaq may emerge as a third force in the competition. 
<BR>
<P>The foundation's award is also a boost for the Pittsburgh Supercomputer 
<BR>
Center, which has been in jeopardy since March of 1997 when the foundation 
<BR>
announced it planned to cut in half the number of supercomputer centers it 
<BR>
finances -- from four to two. 
<BR>
<P>The remaining two centers are the National Center for Supercomputer 
<BR>
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the San 
<BR>
Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California at San Diego. 
<BR>
<P>The Pittsburgh supercomputer will be designed and built by Compaq Computer 
<BR>
Corporation and the new machine will have a peak performance of about six 
<BR>
trillion mathematical operations per second - or six teraflops - when it is 
<BR>
completely installed some time in the second half of next year. 
<BR>
<P>The most powerful military supercomputer is a 12 teraflop supercomputer 
<BR>
called ASCI White, which is being installed at Lawrence Livermore National 
<BR>
Laboratory in Livermore, Calif. The machine will cost $110 million, take up 
<BR>
two basketball courts worth of floor space, weigh 106 tons and will 8.192 
<BR>
processors. 
<BR>
<P>The Compaq computer will be based on 2.728 Alpha processors, which will be 
<BR>
organized into 682 separate nodes and will cost about $36 million. 
<BR>
<P>The new computer will be shared by different scientific disciplines, 
<BR>
including materials science and climate modeling. Because the new machine 
<BR>
will have six times the power of the current fastest nonmilitary computer, 
<BR>
Mr. Borchers said it was possible that it would be able to do fundamentally 
<BR>
new science. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I suspect in the areas of materials and biological science it will be 
<BR>
possible to make significant advances,&quot; he said.
