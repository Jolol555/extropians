<P>
Daniel Ust has generously offered,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, he used mainly physical problems and speculations about such to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guide the math and, from what I've read, he was a poor mathematician.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll go along with that. Thanks for the pointer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Darwin was actually what we would call a naturalist.  He was deeply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influenced by the geologist Lyell, whose notion of gradualism -- viz., the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same processes at work now were working in the past to create all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; geological formations we see today -- had an impact of Darwin's theory of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I should have written naturalist instead of evolutionist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do think of the airplane as an invention and most people at the time of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the brothers Wright would probably have agreed.
</EM><BR>
<P>So they were inventors rather than bicyclists. Good.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I won't argue with this, though I don't want to diss Marx completely.  His
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view of dialectics is quite interesting, though he did not, sadly, apply it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to his own philosophy.  But if he had logged on to Priceline.com or heard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; William Shatner singing about it, who knows what he might have applied the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money he would have saved to.
</EM><BR>
<P>He probably would have done with it whatever his mother told him to do with it.
<BR>
I've heard he was an incorrigible momma's boy.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, my &quot;modest proposal to shorten the name Singularitarian&quot; would be to
<BR>
call themselves Singulariters.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We participate, therefore we are.&quot;
