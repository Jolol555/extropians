Sarah Lawrence <A HREF="mailto:sl@TCS.ac?Subject=Re:%20Is%20Eugenics%20Really%20A%20Bad%20Thing?&In-Reply-To=&lt;NEBBJFIIHLGDGJLCGMBIKELPCAAA.mike99@lascruces.com&gt;">sl@TCS.ac</A> appears to have written:
<BR>
<P>When we are all acting upon our own best eugenic theories -- whether that
<BR>
means just choosing a father for one's children based on the man's height,
<BR>
physical attractiveness, and success in the workplace, say, or OTOH making
<BR>
use of whatever research is available to produce (what you hope will be) a
<BR>
genetically improved child -- there is much less likely to be a systematic
<BR>
error introduced. When different individuals' theories are allowed to
<BR>
compete, as it were, our knowledge of how to improve things is much more
<BR>
likely to improve. If you let individuals decide whether to make use of the
<BR>
available information or not, any actual improvements there are will speak
<BR>
for themselves and presumably, if that is indeed a good thing, people will
<BR>
choose it for themselves without having to be forced into it.
<BR>
<P><P>Yes, IMO this is the most rational and beneficial way to approach the issue.
<BR>
Coercion by governments or even non-governmental pressure groups is the only
<BR>
objectionable aspect of eugenics. I suspect that, in terms of the infernally
<BR>
delicate issue of race, we will see people of different races employing
<BR>
eugenics to make functional improvements in their offspring while retaining
<BR>
the superficial attributes of their own race. My reason for believing this
<BR>
is the relatively low (although increasing) rate of interracial marriage
<BR>
today, and the objections raised by many black groups to the adoption of
<BR>
orphaned black children by white parents. I see nothing wrong with these
<BR>
atavistic attitudes so long as they are the free choices of individuals and
<BR>
not some sort of government mandated racism.
