<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But I know people, for example, who might trade three putative IQ points

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stuck in loops of self-criticism, not exactly the highest thing there

<EM>&gt; &gt; is.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Okay.  I don't disagree with that.  (Well, actually I do disagree with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.  I deeply, fundamentally, and irrevocably disagree with that.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't think it's worth shaving three IQ points off your *potential*,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much less your actuality, even if the alternative is running a 20%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifetime risk of suicide.)  All I'm saying is that, with the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state of neuropharmacology, you can either be happy or you can be smart,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not both.
</EM><BR>
<P>What good is an extra 3 IQ points when you have less than half of the
<BR>
available time to use it?  I would say they're worthless.  I would further add
<BR>
that having 20 extra IQ points, while being deeply depressed and immobilized,
<BR>
is almost completely worthless. After all what exactly are we referring to as
<BR>
intelligence - raw logical reasoning abilities and nothing more?  What good is
<BR>
it if you don't have the emotional strength to utilize it in any meaningful
<BR>
way?  I know a few people who are extremely intelligent and have spent the
<BR>
majority of their adult lives laying on their beds depressed with absolutely
<BR>
no ambition to do anything.  What have they accomplished?  One of these
<BR>
individuals finally started taking an extract of St John's Wort and is now up
<BR>
and about, holding a steady job and actually beginning to enjoy his life.  For
<BR>
the first time, he is actually contemplating moving out of the city in which
<BR>
he has lived for over 20 years.
