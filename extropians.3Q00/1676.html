<EM>&gt; Here's the July 10th message I was referring to.  Are you saying it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not an attack?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Well, hello troll, I haven't seen you around here before... do you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything substantive to say, or are you just a hit &amp; run luddite?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to my files, I had posted twice prior to the attack so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really do feel like the author was trying to Catch-22 me (&quot;don't post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here until you've been seen posting for a while&quot;).  I don't know if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he is the moderator or not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, Robert, here we go again.  My labeling of you as a troll was in
<BR>
response to this post:

<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes it is, you are right.  The good news is we can take the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; GMC emblems off of pickup trucks in the junk yards, cut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; off the C and have a great metal GM logo...  {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You could also rename this rather dubious &quot;science&quot; Genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Modified Crap and save hacksaw blades.
</EM><BR>
<P>I dinged you for being rude and lacking content, not simply for being
<BR>
new.  You took exception to this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Doug, be warned that I've got an industrial weed-control flamer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that can be pointed your way if you want to start something with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;troll&quot; horseshit.  For that matter, I can back up the manure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spreader to your front door and return your load of HS in a place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you might not want it.  Be civil.
</EM><BR>
<P>In return, I offered some advice:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;You're not likely to gain much credence here if you start out with
<BR>
&nbsp;scatological notes and don't back up your assertions with evidence.
<BR>
&nbsp;The burden of proof is on you- where's your beef?
<BR>
<P>That is *not* a catch-22.  It was a request for you to back up your
<BR>
&quot;fighting words&quot; with evidence.  I'm not a moderator, not do I have any
<BR>
position of authority here.  Playing the victim card isn't likely to
<BR>
gain you much credence, either.  Argue the issues, not the personalites.
