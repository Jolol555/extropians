&nbsp;&nbsp;The person with the highest IQ, Marilyn Vos Savant,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has a column in the Washington Post magazine Parade
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;called &quot;Ask Marilyn.&quot; A recent question was if she
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed that &quot;the purpose of life is to undertake
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a selfish endeavor to make oneself happy.&quot; She
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;concludes that the only argument supporting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that (Randian) view is based on a fallacy:
<BR>
<P>==================================================
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Washington Post PARADE, 7/30/00, page 11
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;ASK MARILYN
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;By Marilyn Vos Savant
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;QUESTION: Humans have long questioned the purpose
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of their existence. However, I believe the answer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to this supposed eternal dilemma is relatively
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;simplistic: The purpose of life is to undertake
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a selfish endeavor to make oneself happy. Anything
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and everything an individual does--in the long
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;term--is solely for this purpose. Would you agree?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;MARILYN: ... you seem to be answering the question,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Toward what goal do all humans aim?&quot; In defense
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of your answer, you could argue that even apparently
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;altruistic behavior is still undertaken to give
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oneself pleasure. As an example, consider the case
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Mother Teresa: You could suggest that relieving
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the suffering of India's poorest people made Mother
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Teresa happy herself, and that's why she undertook
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to do so. In short, you could argue that any chosen
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;behavior, just by the fact that it is chosen,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;indicates a selfish endeavor. But this is based on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a logical fallacy called petitio principii (better
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;known as &quot;begging the question&quot;), a circular argument
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in which the conclusion also appears as an assumption.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't find any other defense of your answer, so I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;can't agree with it.
<BR>
=====================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: It seems to follow from Savant's answer that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the goal toward which all humans aim is NOT selfish
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;endeavor to make oneself happy. Where's the evidence?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What people act with intent not to satisfy themselves?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even someone marching along at gunpoint follows orders
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;because it satisfies them not to be shot for resistance.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even someone killing themselves has concluded that death
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would be more satisfactory of them than life, it's even
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;said by some that suicide is selfish.  People engage in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;charitable behavior because it satisfies them and they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;earn social rewards for noble action. Even a masochist
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;who acts to hurt himself finds satisfaction in such.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I and three others are starving to death in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arctic and I kill myself so the others can eat me,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I did so because it satisfied me to help them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If no human action is selfless, how is Savant right?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If self-satisfaction is not the goal toward which all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;humans aim, then what is the goal of all human action?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that what Savant claims to be a logical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fallacy is in fact an inherent truism of human action.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it isn't a truism, then please identify an action
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and/or goal of a self that is truly 100% selfless.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems to me that identifying such is impossible.
