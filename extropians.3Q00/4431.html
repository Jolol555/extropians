I have to break in on this topic with a reminder. Solar is something I am 
<BR>
100% for, however, what will liberate solar and wind, or rather ignite it, 
<BR>
will be the conversion of photovoltaic and wind energy into fuel for fuel 
<BR>
cells or perhaps, flywheels. Storage for evening or dark day times is the 
<BR>
key. All weather solar power and wind power are another issue. If we just 
<BR>
listen to the blathers about solar being merely a sunbelt energy, it will 
<BR>
never take off. Fusion looks plausible, but directionless, and therefore 
<BR>
gut-shot.

<EM>  &gt; Actually, for thin film amorphous, 10% is about exactly what the 
</EM><BR>
conversion
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; efficiency is. I was wondering where you get your 'insolation' figure 
</EM><BR>
from. The
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;True, but you can get 20% panels, too, and more, if price is
<BR>
&nbsp;irrelevant (~32% is about the best we can get iirc with multilayer
<BR>
&nbsp;GaAs). With 10% I'm operating on the low end of the efficiency
<BR>
&nbsp;spectrum, not coincidentially the best efficiency in wattage/$
<BR>
&nbsp;produced.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; atmosphere cuts solar flux from just over 1.4 kw/m^2 down to just over 1 
</EM><BR>
kw/m^2.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;The insolation figure is totally ad hoc, since I don't have access to
<BR>
&nbsp;my library, and a websearch via dialup in Krautland is a bear. I just
<BR>
&nbsp;thought that 0.5 kW/m^2 on the average over a 10 h period in
<BR>
&nbsp;California-type area is the about the right ballpark figure, if the
<BR>
&nbsp;solar flux constant is 1.3 kW/m^2. I would of course welcome seeing
<BR>
&nbsp;real numbers.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; &gt; 2) solar cells do not require direct sunlight to generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; &gt;    juice. diffuse daylight does nicely, especially when we're talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; &gt;    about amorphous cells.
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; Sure, but their efficiency decreases as flux decreases, and total flux 
</EM><BR>
does
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; decrease with diffusion, as visible is converted to IR. If your flux 
</EM><BR>
drops by
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I thought thin-film amorphous did at least NIR rather well.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; half due to diffusion by cloud cover, and the efficiency drops as well as 
</EM><BR>
flux
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; drops, your output decreases markedly.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I did not know the average number of cloudy days in California, and
<BR>
&nbsp;just took 365, assuming the few 10 days would not make a difference,
<BR>
&nbsp;as other parameters have been chosen rather conservatively, and this
<BR>
&nbsp;is a back of the envelope estimate.

&nbsp;Nitpicker! &gt;&gt;
