<EM>&gt;&gt;From: Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20paying%20the%20artists:%20the%20spike&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000801074352.80513.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Please, napster fans, how do we motivate people to do things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;like writing The Spike if their blood, sweat and tears can so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;easily be copied free?  How much thought do you put into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;your extropian posts?  Very little if you are anything like me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Would you want books that were no higher quality than what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;we read on our chat groups?  Have any of you chat groups
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;that are *not* brainy ones like extropians?  I do: a motorcycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;enthusiasts group.  The writing there is so poor and the thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;so shallow it is scarcely worth the effort to hit the delete key on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;most of them.  Is our literary future to be like that?  Napster fans?
</EM><BR>
<P>How about let’s give the “new economy” a chance to do its thing.  Yes there 
<BR>
was once upon a time called now when you could only make money by moving a 
<BR>
commodity that derived its value from the fact that it was in limited supply 
<BR>
and could not be duplicated without some prohibitive degree of capital 
<BR>
investment.  But jump ahead to the future called now where people are 
<BR>
earning money from little more than the fact that they can garner the 
<BR>
attention of other people.  Yes John and Jane Doe can set up a webcam in 
<BR>
their home and thousands of people a year will drop by just to take a peek.  
<BR>
Mr. &amp; Mrs. Doe can then sell ad space, or post MLM links on their site and 
<BR>
make enough money to more than pay for the computer and high-bandwidth net 
<BR>
connection.
<BR>
<P>So sure, there’ll be a lot of low-quality crap floating around where content 
<BR>
creators are not assured of big bucks from the traditional fancy packaging / 
<BR>
marketing blitz form of distribution.  But that will just make the high 
<BR>
quality product that much more enticing (and profitable).  Methinks J.K. 
<BR>
Rowling could put up her works on the net for download fee of a dollar per 
<BR>
person per chapter and do quite alright for herself.  Sure some would say 
<BR>
that she wouldn’t have garnered all the attention in the first place if it 
<BR>
wasn’t for the marketing machine of big publishing.  But I say there is no 
<BR>
better marketing machine than the internet, if used properly.  Think Blair 
<BR>
Witch.  Time will tell...
<BR>
