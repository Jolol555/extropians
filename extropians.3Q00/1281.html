<P><EM>&gt; It is my opinion that depression never killed anybody. In general,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  suicide is the treatment of choice for those who are afraid to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  openly express intense rage and whose self-pity motivates a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  desire to inflict the punishment of guilt on selected survivors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert, I have to disagree with you in the strongest possible terms.  Perhaps 
<BR>
it is the unhappy fate of one attracted to extremely creative people to have 
<BR>
done so, but I have experienced manic depression in more than a few of the 
<BR>
people I've been very close to in my life.  I have seen depression kill as 
<BR>
surely as cancer.  And I can attest from close personal experience that those 
<BR>
deaths had a biochemical cause just as surely as the ones that were caused by 
<BR>
cancer.  To say that people suffering from clinical depression commit suicide 
<BR>
because they are &quot;afraid to openly express rage&quot; and that they are &quot;motivated 
<BR>
by self pity&quot;, etc., is like saying that a quadriplegic with a severed spinal 
<BR>
chord can't walk because she is crippled: True, so far as it goes, but hardly 
<BR>
helpful in any sense of scientific medicine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  While clinical depression can be the result of a variety of initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  conditions, both Freud and Jung at least in this area agreed --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Freud called it &quot;regression in the service of the ego&quot; and Jung,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in his esoteric way, called it &quot;negredo&quot; or &quot;decensus&quot; -- the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; sort of thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Michael's description of Freud and Jung as &quot;matching period poets, of seminal 
<BR>
artistry, but hardly the final word on any matter,&quot; couldn't have said it 
<BR>
better.  I read a little Freud and a LOT of Jung many years ago and, while I 
<BR>
can attest that there is much of value in the latter especially, and 
<BR>
especially for the artist, the idea of citing them as authority for any 
<BR>
proposition of scientific psychology in the last third of the 20th century 
<BR>
(much less in the 21st) seems absurd to me.  To me, that would be like citing 
<BR>
Ptolemy on a question of astrophysics or Paracelsus on a question of 
<BR>
chemistry - of keen interest to historians, but little else.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  At any rate, we may suppose that at least some exogenous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  depressions are a phase in a process of psychic reconstruction.
</EM><BR>
<P>We &quot;may&quot; also suppose that they are caused by demon possession.  We could 
<BR>
also construct a complex and &quot;complete&quot; theory of psychology on the basis of 
<BR>
that supposition.  However, using the tools we now have at our disposal to 
<BR>
study the action of the mind and brain, it seems much more correct to 
<BR>
conclude that a disease process in some individuals can progress to the point 
<BR>
that descriptions of things like depression solely in terms of the &quot;software&quot; 
<BR>
of the mind can't lead to an actual therapeutic result.  In some individuals, 
<BR>
the hardware is so badly out of whack that the ability of purely cognitive 
<BR>
activity to bring about &quot;psychic reconstruction&quot; is fatally impaired.
