<P><EM>&gt; CYMM SAYS: I really wish I had such faith... I'm not even sure that our

<EM>&gt; cirrent civilization is robust enough to withstand the slings &amp; arrows of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the 21st Century. There is far too much interdependence and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overpopulation...
</EM><BR>
<P>I won't comment on the interdependence, since that is a matter
<BR>
of specialization and I'm almost positive that Robin would
<BR>
argue strongly that that makes us all richer.  We would probably
<BR>
be able to support a much smaller population without such
<BR>
interdependence because we would all have to be relatively
<BR>
inefficient generalists.
<BR>
<P>With regard to &quot;overpopulation&quot;, this is a *MYTH*, a *LIE*,
<BR>
an *INCORRECT MEME*, and anything else of the same ilk that
<BR>
you would care to call it.
<BR>
<P>Unlike many people on the list and throughout the world, I've
<BR>
traveled it extensively.  For *most* of the of the world --
<BR>
the United States, Canada, Russia, India and Australia to name
<BR>
a few there is *no* overpopulation problem.  Yes, there are
<BR>
places where there are high population densities (Tokyo,
<BR>
Mexico City, Cairo) where that population density is severely
<BR>
stressing the local environment and infrastructure, primarily
<BR>
in 3rd world countries.  However, those are economic, technology
<BR>
and infrastructure problems, NOT OVERPOPULATION.  Overpopulation
<BR>
is something you have been sold by the greens and you should look
<BR>
at it very very closely.  Go back and look at how often the Club
<BR>
of Rome has been wrong in their predictions.
<BR>
<P>A larger population allows a greater fraction of &quot;fundamental&quot;
<BR>
R&amp;D individuals to be supported which in turn increases the
<BR>
knowledge base to allow us to become more productive.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; a descent to a &quot;lower&quot; level of civilization would provoke
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mass death &amp; and huge loss of technological knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be very hard to lose large masses of technological
<BR>
knowledge (given the number of places in which it is stored)
<BR>
and serious studies of even global thermonuclar war show that
<BR>
it is are very survivable (Sagan stretched things a fair amount
<BR>
to make his arguments, perhaps justifiably so.)
<BR>
<P>If you like, I can go dig out the references.  On this list
<BR>
you need to be prepared to back up your &quot;statements of fact&quot;
<BR>
or disclaim them with &quot;in my opinions&quot;...
