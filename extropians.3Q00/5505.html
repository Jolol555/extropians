&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interesting. i would give it to 'em, pretty much regardless of the
<BR>
amount. after all, it is previously _undiscovered_ wealth right? so we are
<BR>
not talking about a zero-sum game here. in fact, the chances are that i
<BR>
too will get a teenie-weenie bit wealthier as a result. in the very
<BR>
unlikely event that the lucky dog hoards every penny of vis pot of gold,
<BR>
the effect is just neutral. what about the very, very, unlikely event that
<BR>
ve does something &quot;evil&quot; with the dole? well, the reason that it is very,
<BR>
very unlikely is that &quot;evil&quot; is usually a product of scarcity, not of
<BR>
wealth.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally, the gene-pool argument -- what can i say? ve can knock
<BR>
verself out with the conspecifics, it doesn't really concern me.
