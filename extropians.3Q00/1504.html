<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Crocker. =) Bygones. Seriously though, when I talk/write with someone, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't view it as adversarial. I view it more as an attempt by all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; parties to discover something new, together. More of a cooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; push/pull towards some undiscovered country of the mind (and all it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; entails), rather than a here's my opinion, bow down. If you'd rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have an &quot;argument&quot; I'll oblige, but I'd rather not if it's all the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to you. =)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ha. Well, I understand that some people view my conversational manner as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; confrontational or argumentative. I know that in plenty of my posts, I do lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patience with opinions or statements that I see as uninformed or in willful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; denial of the facts, even after the facts have been clearly posted and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; referenced. People who prefer to think the best of themselves obviously resent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; when I call them by their proper names, names they deserve if they are to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I try not to call anyone names. The portion of people that I see through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fora such as this is very tiny as to their actual being, as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being a medium that seems at times to thrive on miscommunications. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I will do is call into question their statements, their use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words/phrasology, their logic and reasoning, their assumptions, etc.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but rarely, if ever, will I call into question their character. It seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterproductive and often fosters more road blocks to useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communication. Now, don't get me wrong Mike (if I may take the liberty).
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone on the list is free to speak informally with me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your style of communication is one that I enjoy in that you are very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; straightforward and do not mince words. I suppose that I tend to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others the benefit of the doubt more so than I should, but at the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the day I can honestly say that I tried to be very reasonable in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding others. It just doesn't seem profitable to engender anger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in others over a set of topics if in the future they may be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; present information to me on other topics in a manner I agree with, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would never realize because I called them something less than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pleasant. Do you agree?
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess its part my Scottish heritage and part my Yankee upbringing, but
<BR>
in my book, a spade is a spade, and failing to let someone know where
<BR>
they stand with you when they are engaged in a conversation is akin to
<BR>
dishonesty.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beleive the things they do without significant thought. Other people who do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like to have their most cherished misconceptions challenged dislike dealing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; myself, or Lee, or others on the list who do not suffer fools so gladly as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; others seem willing to do. Being of the school that 'that which does not kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I might argue they dislike dealing with you (and L. Crocker) not because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their misconceptions are challenged, but rather due to the manner in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which they are confronted. Which do you think is more engendering of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exchange of information? 1)&quot;Your opinion is unfounded, because of x.&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versus 2)&quot;Your ignorance is showing, because of x.&quot; It's a question of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; style, I suppose. And like anything in that subjective realm, is open to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpretation, granted. For me, my style is an approach based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliciting communication, not reducing the conversation to mudslinging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which is in no way meant to imply that you (and L. Crocker) do this on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this purpose. But, it does seem to happen frequently with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussions you have with others that you disagree with.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find that to change someones mental paradigm, you have to sometimes
<BR>
shock them out of their mental straightjackets. When someone is
<BR>
blathering on in meaningless linguistic hysteria, they sometimes need a
<BR>
verbal smack up side the head to jar them out of their rut, to get their
<BR>
attention. We can talk and talk all day, but if they don't actually
<BR>
LISTEN, then I am wasting my time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you makes you stronger', I look at my adversarial manner, which IMHO I actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rarely release in full force, as a tool by which others may improve themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems slightly disingenuous of you to live by this creed unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make it clear upfront. If you come to the table of conversation thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of war, then of course I'm going to lose. How do I get stronger, if I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crushed right off the bat leaving me with no emotional fortitude to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explain that my last post had an unfortunate typo? A silly example, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be sure, but the point is illustrative. IMHO, it's very easy to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adversarial, it's very difficult to elicit cooperative communication.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For me, I'd rather improve my skills at the latter than the former. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard enough understanding people you are very close to, let alone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone I only see written words from. Name calling seems to make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; odds even worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a difference between calling a person a name and labeling their
<BR>
ideas. If someone has a fascist idea, I will call it by its right name,
<BR>
not mince words or describe it diplomatically. If someone has a racist,
<BR>
luddite, or other idea, I will call it that. I find that many people who
<BR>
dislike labeling things tend to have emotional distast for confrontation
<BR>
and standing up for what they beleive. I respect fortitude and
<BR>
integrity. Mealy mouthed hyperbolizers practicing linguistic hopscotch
<BR>
are what insult me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I know that when others come back at me to bring my own misconceptions to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attention, it does improve me as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very true. Let me ask you this: How would you want those misconceptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presented to you?
</EM><BR>
<P>I like them presented as straightforward as possible, with the facts and
<BR>
refs. If I'm being an absolute idiot, I expect someone to say 'Hey
<BR>
idiot'. I'm quite aware that people in other geographic areas tend to be
<BR>
put off by my decidedly northeastern US style. I saw a demonstration of
<BR>
this quite clearly on my trip west to Montana, when Eric, who is from
<BR>
the Bronx, I, and Julie, a 19 year old Russian emigre, were involved in
<BR>
discussions while traveling. Eric is extremely straight forward and
<BR>
verbally agressive, so much so that even I could tell, causing Julie to
<BR>
constantly feel that she was under personal attack, when that was not
<BR>
Eric's purpose or intent at all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That being said, I do not come to the list 'looking for an argument', however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as seen in the stats posted regarding the percent of the population that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beleives in creationism, there is obviously a large chunk of the population that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is living in Egypt at any given time...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll be the first to let my stupidity and ignorance show and say I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no idea what this means. The Egypt part, that is. =)
</EM><BR>
<P>People imprisoned in the land of de nile... ;)
