<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; You can change the world a lot faster with a Singularity. Can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  argument showing that it would be better to spend my time having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  discussions, and generally &quot;working within the system&quot;, rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than &quot;playing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a bit with computers&quot; as you so unbiasedly put it? &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's assuming that Singularity actually arrives at the time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manner you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire. It may take its own time for technical reasons. Certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it may not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrive all at once.
</EM><BR>
<P>There could also be an entirely different sort of singularity.  For accounts
<BR>
of past singularities, see _Plagues and Peoples_ by William McNeill,
<BR>
_Floods, Famine, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations_ by
<BR>
Brian M. Fagan, and anything you can find by Pitrim Alexandrovich Sorokin.
<BR>
Most of his works are out of print, but there's a recent reprint under the
<BR>
title _Social and Cultural Dynamics: A Study of Change in Major Systems of
<BR>
Art, Truth, Ethics, Law and Social Relationships_
<BR>
<P>Of these, I find Sorokin's works to be by far the most interesting.  I've
<BR>
not read the recent reprint, but I believe it's a summary of a multi-volume
<BR>
work he wrote during a period of years roughly centered around 1930. Sorokin
<BR>
examines the great civilizations of China, India, Peru, and Mexico/Central
<BR>
America as well as the &quot;western&quot; civilizations which gave rise to the one in
<BR>
which we now find ourselves.
<BR>
<P>If I were designing a curriculum for the well-balanced education, I'd
<BR>
include Sorokin's works as mandatory reading.
