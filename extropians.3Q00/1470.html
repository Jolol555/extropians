<EM>&gt; When I was still in grade school in Maine, one summer we had a cow moose and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her calf live in our pasture with the cattle all summer.  She would join the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; herd when we drove them to the barn for milking, and we would have to run her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off.  I don't know if any of my brothers and sisters still have pics of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with our arms around the moose's neck or not.  But we spent a lot of time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the cow and her calf, and never once did we feel like we might have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in danger.  But I do know of bull moose attacking log trucks head on in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evening during mating season...I suppose someone has figured out why they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.  It's probably better not to mess with a moose unless they decide to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hang around you...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah. Your cow moose had probably decided she was a cattle cow, not a
<BR>
moose cow. They do such things occasionally. There was a case a few
<BR>
years ago of a bull moose falling in love with a cattle cow at a farm,
<BR>
only to be unrequited. It sparked quite a series of newspaper articles
<BR>
and even a book...
