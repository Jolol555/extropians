<EM>&gt; Unlike many of the members of this list, I am inclined to agree with Paul.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's too many instances of monopoly power in the history of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commerce/capitalism, to believe that the thing would be all roses if we just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left it to it's own devices. Monopoly power is the commercial equivalent of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feudal overlord domination (bwa ha ha!).
</EM><BR>
<P>Like many other members of the list, I know that the instances of government
<BR>
monopoly power causing harm exceeds by exponential figures than that caused by
<BR>
smaller/less powerful organizations.
<BR>
<P>Your proposals that government should act as a check on the market is as logical
<BR>
as, well, hiring a mass murderer to police a schoolyard bully.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm still interested in dynamism as a concept, I just think the free market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not the optimal dynamic system to choose, especially if you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in the welfare of the individual. I've talked previously (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather naively, but hey) about an alternative system of participartory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democracy &quot;on steroids&quot;, using that to replace the normal concept of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exclusive ownership, to which I would attribute most of the really bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points about capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm really interested to hear what other people can come up with by way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dynamical social systems which are not free-market based, or at least don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rely on the free market as their major mechanism. 
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've said, any sufficiently open participatory mechanism of negotiating value
<BR>
is indistinguishable from a free market. Free markets may not be perfect, and
<BR>
most markets in existence to date have never been completely free markets,
<BR>
however any of the alternatives outside of a benevolent god making perfect
<BR>
decisions for all, all the time, are far far worse than a free market.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Paul, I invite you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start. You're not so hot on uber-capitalism, so what's your alternative?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we've seen much bitching and whining from Paul, but little in the form of
<BR>
constructive detail.
