<EM>&gt; So, to take a classic case, what happens when your security/law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement body decides to haul me away on some charge that makes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to your law making agency but my law making agency and security/law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement utterly disagrees?  Who decides the issue?  Do they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fight it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out?  What next level body and set of rules do they appeal to?
</EM><BR>
<P>Something similar to this situation has developed in the area of
<BR>
international law as applied to e-commerce.  For example, when a dispute
<BR>
arises between a  merchant physically located in Callifornia over goods
<BR>
manufactured in and shipped from Korea to a buyer in England, it's not
<BR>
clear which country's laws will apply for purposes of interpreting the
<BR>
contract, or which courts have jurisdiction in the event one of the
<BR>
parties wishes to file a lawsuit.  Ideally, the parties would specify
<BR>
this in their initial contract, but this is often neglected.
<BR>
<P>The situation is similar to that which existed when merchant ships first
<BR>
began traveling between Europe and China.  While ships were at sea they
<BR>
were bound to the laws of no jurisdiction.  Admiralty law developed in
<BR>
response to the need for predictability in the relationships between
<BR>
ships at sea.
