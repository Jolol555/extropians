<EM>&gt; &gt; Moreover, you are assuming that there is some way you, a pirate

<EM>&gt; broadcaster, can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attract legitimate businesses to advertise with you at a fraction of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; broadcasting with the originator. However, you forget that legitimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; broadcasters can easily agree to black ball any advertiser who advertises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pirate broadcasts, and to not filch each others broadcasts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What's &quot;pirate broadcaster&quot; even mean in this context?  It could be ABC as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much as me... it's not illegal, so it's not piracy.  You use these terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'pirate' and 'legitimate' which only apply in world with copyright.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole argument is getting so tenuous, I can barely see through the smoke.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Legitimate original broadcasters can easily agree to black ball any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advertiser...&quot; ???  The so-called &quot;illegitimate&quot; broadcasters could just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easily do the same, there's simply no &quot;legitimacy&quot; if you don't own your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content.  It would boil down to whoever was best at getting the content to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lots of people and there's simply no a priori reason to suppose that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; original broadcaster would be best at that.
</EM><BR>
<P>I define the difference between pirate and legitimate broadcasters, in the
<BR>
absence of intellectual property laws, to be a matter of ethics, morals, and
<BR>
personal integrity.
<BR>
<P>Your definition of 'best at getting content to lots of people' would have to be
<BR>
tempered by what means of obtaining and delivering that content the ethics of
<BR>
the people (i.e. that of every individual you seek to deliver to) are willing to
<BR>
accept. If the popular opinion of you is that your are a no good theif who
<BR>
steals the work of others, then a popular boycott of you is likely to greatly
<BR>
limit the Q rating of your network, assuming of course that you can find enough
<BR>
people to work for you.
<BR>
<P>Your inability to see through the smoke is obvious, but its the smoked glasses
<BR>
of the shyster that is blocking your view.
