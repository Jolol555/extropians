<EM> &gt; We are at least a jump in substrate away from machines as

<EM> &gt; computationally complex as human brains.  That is just for the hardware
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so. Unless they've started selling computronium at
<BR>
Fry's, or at least WSI of hardware cellular automata machines. They've 
<BR>
barely started using embedded RAM techology yet, and the only
<BR>
parallelism you can buy is either a bunch of DSPs, or hooking up lots
<BR>
of off-shelf hardwarez with off-shelf networking (FastEthernet, GBit
<BR>
Ethernet and maybe Myrinet). No one knows how much biological crunch
<BR>
equivalent a PC has, but it doubt it is more than a primitive insect.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; to be feasible for the task.  The software is another matter that is not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; just going to magically come together.  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Do you know how most scientific codes work? An computational engine of
<BR>
relatively modest complexity is plowing through a mountain of data,
<BR>
over and over and over again. Overall, few % code, the rest of it
<BR>
data.  Frequently, in an embarassingly parallel fashion: many such
<BR>
mills, loosely (only locally) coupled. Here you can speed up things by 
<BR>
using dedicated hardware and/or many nodes (thousands, millions,
<BR>
billions) running in a parallel fashion.
<BR>
<P>The code is easy enough to grok, through finding a magic set of
<BR>
parameters can be tricky. The mountain of data is where most of the
<BR>
magic is. You have to initialize the simulation at the start which
<BR>
something very, very carefully structured.
<BR>
<P>You don't enter that huge of pile of opaque data in a text editor. You 
<BR>
can write the computational engine in a text editor, provided you know 
<BR>
how it is supposed to look like.
<BR>
<P>The only realistic way how to get at that initial set of data is
<BR>
either growing it with an evolutionary algorithm (here the exact
<BR>
nature of the computational engine is less crucial) or scanning a
<BR>
critter. In latter case you'll have to write a very very precise yet
<BR>
high-performance neuronal emulation engine.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure why many apparently smart people still want to do it the
<BR>
Cyc way. Codify everything explicitly, using an army of human
<BR>
programmers, until the thing can limp off on its own. I just don't see
<BR>
it work, because even groups of people are just not smart enough for
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; They can then work on advancing military science 24 hours a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; day. It makes Roswell conspiracy theories pale by comparison. But then
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; this is all just distant futuristic fantasy, right? And we the public can
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; sit back and know that private and military AI research is many decades
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; away from any such state of development.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I would say more like 2 decades away minimum than 1.  But then I saw
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; average consensus for when we would have at least basic nano-assembler
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; systems drop from an average of 20+ years in March to about 12 in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; September.  So I probably should adjust AI guesstimates also.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Your average is not my average. Apart from the bootstrap problem,
<BR>
which can take arbitrarily long, no one has still validated whether
<BR>
the mechanosynthetic reaction repertoire executed by a nanorobot is
<BR>
sufficient for a full closure.
<BR>
<P>It's looking good, and starting looking better year after year, but
<BR>
considering it graven in stone, and a particular flavour of
<BR>
nanotechnology at that, I dunno. My crystal ball is currently in the
<BR>
repair shop.
