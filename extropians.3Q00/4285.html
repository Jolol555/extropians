<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course they are good books, they were written by two people. JK Rowling

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; copied the work of an earlier author and rewrote them.

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Who was this earlier author she used?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don't recall the name, but there is/was a plagiarism lawsuit going on filed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the offended party.
</EM><BR>
<P>I found some information on the web about this.  Rowling is being sued
<BR>
by American author Nancy K. Stouffer, who alleges that Rowling borrowed
<BR>
language and ideas from her 1984 book, &quot;The Legend of Rah and Muggles&quot;.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/317/potterplagiary031700.html">http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/317/potterplagiary031700.html</A>:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stouffer's litany of similarities begins with &quot;muggles.&quot; In Rowling's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potter books, &quot;muggle&quot; is the word used by wizards to mean ordinary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humans. Stouffer's muggles are Lilliputian little people who care
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for two orphaned boys. More to the point, Stouffer says she owns a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trademark on the word &quot;muggle.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, The Legend of Rah and Muggles features characters
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;named Larry Potter and Lilly Potter, and Stouffer also writes about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;characters called &quot;Keepers of the Gardens.&quot; In addition to the obvious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry/Harry link, Rowling also has a Lily (mind you, that's with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just one &quot;l&quot;) Potter, and her books include a &quot;Keeper of the Keys&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character.
<BR>
<P>IMO even if these similarities prove to be more than coincidence, it would
<BR>
hardly be fair to say, as Mike did, that &quot;JK Rowling copied the work of
<BR>
an earlier author and rewrote them&quot;.  His suggestion that such a practice
<BR>
would &quot;of course&quot; lead to a good book is a non sequitur, as well.
