<P>===============================================================
<BR>
URGENT ACTION ITEM! Congress agrees to hold hearing on Monday
<BR>
in response to public outrage over FBI's e-mail spy scheme
<BR>
===============================================================
<BR>
<P>===============================================================
<BR>
You are receiving this alert because you participated in
<BR>
DefendYourPrivacy.com’s successful 1999 campaign against the
<BR>
FDIC’s proposed Know Your Customer bank spying regulation. If
<BR>
you do not want to receive further updates, please use the
<BR>
unsubscribe directions at the end of this message.
<BR>
===============================================================
<BR>
<P>* Immediate action required: Help us Kill the Carnivore!
<BR>
<P>On July 14 we issued a press release about an FBI cybersnooping
<BR>
device code-named Carnivore, which can scan millions of e-mails
<BR>
per second. Because Carnivore has unlimited power to spy on
<BR>
almost everyone with an e-mail account, it may be the biggest
<BR>
threat to your digital privacy ever.
<BR>
<P>Almost immediately after the existence of this project was
<BR>
disclosed in a July 11 Wall Street Journal article, public
<BR>
outrage began to mount -- and now Congress has been pressured
<BR>
into holding hearings on Carnivore.
<BR>
<P>To capitalize on Monday's hearing before a House Judiciary
<BR>
Committee panel, we’ve launched a campaign to &quot;Kill the
<BR>
Carnivore&quot;!
<BR>
<P>Politicians on Capitol Hill may be planning to mollify the
<BR>
public by starting an &quot;investigation&quot; into the system, but
<BR>
that's not enough: We want to stop the Carnivore in its tracks
<BR>
and kill it -- before it devours your privacy.
<BR>
<P>Please read this e-mail and *IMMEDIATELY* take the action
<BR>
below. Then forward this e-mail to friends, and ask them to do
<BR>
the same.
<BR>
<P>BACKGROUND: Carnivore is a hardware-software device that the
<BR>
FBI secretly developed at its lab in Quantico, Va.  Dubbed
<BR>
Carnivore because of its ability to find &quot;the meat&quot; among
<BR>
millions of e-mails, Carnivore scans every incoming and
<BR>
outgoing e-mail message on a network looking for telltale words
<BR>
or names, and saves those messages for later retrieval by law
<BR>
enforcement. Carnivore can also track instant messages, visits
<BR>
to websites, and Internet relay chat sessions.
<BR>
<P>The FBI admits that Carnivore will scan millions of e-mail
<BR>
messages from innocent people to find a tiny number of messages
<BR>
from people suspected of crimes.  That's no different than if
<BR>
the FBI opened everyone's mail hoping to find a letter from a
<BR>
criminal, or listened in on everyone's phone calls just in case
<BR>
a crime was being discussed.
<BR>
<P>Though Carnivore's existence was just publicly revealed, the
<BR>
FBI has already installed the device at dozens of Internet
<BR>
Service Providers (ISPs) around the country, and claims it has
<BR>
used it &quot;fewer than 50 times&quot; so far. In many cases, the FBI
<BR>
keeps the device in a locked cage on the ISP's premises, with
<BR>
agents making daily visits to retrieve the captured data.
<BR>
<P>Many ISPs have refused to allow the FBI to install Carnivore,
<BR>
citing concerns that the privacy of all their customers could
<BR>
be violated. But earlier this year, a federal judge ruled
<BR>
against one such ISP, leaving it no choice but to allow the FBI
<BR>
access to its system.
<BR>
<P>Predictably, the FBI promises to limit surveillance to messages
<BR>
from suspected hackers, terrorists, or drug dealers. But
<BR>
considering that this is the same agency that quietly inserted
<BR>
&quot;roving telephone tap&quot; authority into federal law and illegally
<BR>
turned over confidential personnel files to the Clinton White
<BR>
House, you shouldn't be expected to trust it with your
<BR>
confidential e-mails.
<BR>
<P>But Carnivore is more than a threat to your ordinary e-mail
<BR>
correspondence -- it also gives government bureaucrats the
<BR>
ability to spy on your online banking transactions, because it
<BR>
has the ability to monitor all digital communications. The
<BR>
bottom line is that your privacy won't be protected as long as
<BR>
Carnivore is on the loose.
<BR>
<P>At this point, no legislation to eliminate Carnivore has been
<BR>
proposed. However, with your help we can change that. Keep in
<BR>
mind that we kicked off our campaign to kill the FDIC's &quot;Know
<BR>
Your Customer&quot; bank spy scheme last year before any legislation
<BR>
existed. But once we informed the public about this threat to
<BR>
their financial privacy, they swung into action and demanded an
<BR>
immediate end to the program. Americans flooded Capitol Hill
<BR>
with over 300,000 angry e-mails and phone calls, and within
<BR>
weeks, Know Your Customer was withdrawn.
<BR>
<P>We believe that once Americans learn about Carnivore's
<BR>
outrageous assault on their electronic privacy, they will
<BR>
demand legislation to abolish it as well.
<BR>
<P>That's why we're asking you to join the &quot;Kill the Carnivore&quot;
<BR>
campaign!
<BR>
<P><P>WHAT TO DO:
<BR>
<P>Call the Congressional switchboard, toll free, at
<BR>
1-888-449-3511. If that number is busy try 202-225-3121 or
<BR>
202-224-3121. Then ask to speak to the office of your
<BR>
Congressional representative. The switchboard is open 24 hours,
<BR>
and most House offices have voice mail, so please make the call
<BR>
as soon as you get this message.
<BR>
<P><P>WHAT TO SAY:
<BR>
<P>(1) Identify yourself and let them know you are a voter in
<BR>
their district. Leave your name, address, complete with ZIP
<BR>
code, and phone number. Please be brief, especially if you are
<BR>
leaving a message.
<BR>
<P>(2) Let them know that you're calling in response to Monday's
<BR>
hearing on the FBI's Carnivore e-mail spy scheme. (The hearing
<BR>
is being held by the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee
<BR>
on the Constitution.) Tell them that Carnivore poses an
<BR>
immediate threat to your e-mail privacy and that you want it
<BR>
abolished. Specifically, ask your representative to personally
<BR>
sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to abolish the FBI's
<BR>
Carnivore program now! Insist that you do *not* want an
<BR>
investigation, or Congressional hearings, or a &quot;blue ribbon&quot;
<BR>
commission -- you want to Kill the Carnivore now!
<BR>
<P>(3) Ask them to write you a letter spelling out their position
<BR>
on Carnivore, and detailing what they intend to do.
<BR>
<P>One more thing: Please forward this e-mail to friends, and ask
<BR>
them to call their representative, too. Thank you for your help!
