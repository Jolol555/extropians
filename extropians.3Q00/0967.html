<P>I'd be interested in a source for this claim. I think there is a
<BR>
difference between effects that cause the brain to develop better
<BR>
(within an upper bound), such as good nutrition and a positively
<BR>
stimulating environment, and those changes that can be called
<BR>
evolutionary. I would believe the former on a time scale of fifty years,
<BR>
but changes on the order of the addition of the cortex haven't been seen
<BR>
in the last hundreds of thousands of years. Indeed, our general body
<BR>
plan hasn't changed significantly for a much longer period than that.
<BR>
<P>What we need is a huge database of fMRI scans of people at various ages,
<BR>
racial groups, gender combinations, and under specific environments.
<BR>
Then we can establish some baselines for a number of different things,
<BR>
such as what gross features and their functions seem to be a good
<BR>
starting place for a common denominator. To my knowledge, this isn't
<BR>
currently being done. Anyone else know differently?
