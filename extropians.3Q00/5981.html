<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As a first point, many of the libertarian principles that I have seen seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;be a slightly repackaged form of some of the more practical theories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anarchism.  In this case, it almsot seems libertarianism is an example of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;predictive anarchism and possibly a series of templates for the construction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of social temporary autonomous zones (and here is where I fail in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; attribution;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;this idea is NOT mine).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Libertarianism taken to its logical extreme does indeed lead to anarchy, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; to be exact.  Some of your further comments suggest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that you don't appreciate that there is a whole spectrum of political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; thought among anarchists:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I disagree.  Please show your argument that libertarianism, strong human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rights, leads to anarchy or anarcho-capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It follows from the more individualist end of the libertarian philosophy, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the state's monopoly on force should end. When it ends, what replaces it? Most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people think chaos and barbarism when they think of the word anarchy, but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just a deep meme they've been infected with continuously since childhood by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the entire power structure around them. It could not be further from the truth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anarchy is not about chaos or lawlessness, it is about privatizing law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making its providers competitors in the market to provide the best justice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Actually, your first sentence does not follow unless (at least) there
<BR>
are no critical functions done by a state that cannot be done as well or
<BR>
better by private parties.  But this is the core of the dispute.  I
<BR>
think that to successfully argue libertarianism leads to anarchy one
<BR>
would have to delineate all state functions and show for each that it
<BR>
could be performed quite adequately and without producing as bad or
<BR>
worse problems privately.  As bad or worse hinges around as bad or worse
<BR>
for individuals and individual rights being upheld.  Of course to do
<BR>
this comparison there also needs to be agreement on what individual
<BR>
rights are and are not and even some meta-agreement on the core that
<BR>
such rights grow out of.
<BR>
<P>I do not see how multiplying the number of private law providers and
<BR>
enforcers actually makes life and cooperative, predicatable activity
<BR>
more likely.  On the surface it seems to add extra levels of
<BR>
complication.  Problems that did have on central body of law and
<BR>
arbitrators now have N such bodies.  These bodies act similarly to small
<BR>
States in this respect.  So domestic conflicts are escalated into
<BR>
international (er, inter-syndicate?) ones.
