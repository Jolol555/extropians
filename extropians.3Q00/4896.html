Scientists failed to find the Miss Waldron's Red
<BR>
Colobus monkey in six years of surveys- it is now
<BR>
officially extinct, the Yahoo News told me yesterday. 
<BR>
The first extinct primate of the twentieth century
<BR>
(apparently, the surveys ended in '99, but for some
<BR>
reason the announcement of this was delayed until
<BR>
yesterday).  This type of primate has not been seen in
<BR>
over twenty years, and is likely gone for good.
<BR>
I consider this yet another point not to take lightly
<BR>
when we consider what is happening to our world every
<BR>
day.
<BR>
10 percent of the 608 species and subspecies of
<BR>
primates on three continents are officially in the
<BR>
danger zone or imperiled.  An additional ten percent
<BR>
are not currently considered &quot;in jeopardy&quot; but will
<BR>
dissappear within a few decades if their land and
<BR>
habitat is not preserved.
<BR>
Data on extinct or endangered species is available
<BR>
here:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.wcmc.org.uk/">http://www.wcmc.org.uk/</A>
<BR>
though I'm certain you all know well enough what the
<BR>
danger is- our diminishing and weakening biosphere.
<BR>
Many have stated that the advancement of technology
<BR>
will soon resolve these problems- and certainly it
<BR>
will serve as an aid in their alleviation, but in our
<BR>
era, action on our part is necessary in order to stop
<BR>
the destruction of this environment.
<BR>
I've noticed a trend of what you might call, &quot;armchair
<BR>
environmentalists.&quot;  People who will strongly
<BR>
criticize polluting companies in private conversation
<BR>
with each other, who might recycle, who might write an
<BR>
editorial peice to the newspaper, might even have a
<BR>
poster on their wall somewhere, or a bumper sticker on
<BR>
their car, but whose interest in the environment is
<BR>
otherwise editorial.  Few in the modern day seem
<BR>
willing to truly do anything about the environment,
<BR>
and I think this is in part due to social factors
<BR>
counteracting any sort of activism.
<BR>
One needs look only so far as the results of the WTO
<BR>
&quot;riot&quot; to see why people are afraid of trying to
<BR>
accomplish anything.  Eye-witness accounts report the
<BR>
use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and other deterrents,
<BR>
as well as physical attacks and long-term harrasement
<BR>
to drive protesters to the point of frenzy.  There
<BR>
were also reports of plainclothes cops acting as
<BR>
rioters in order to stir up action-
<BR>
&quot;I believe also the police had their own people in
<BR>
there, encouraging people to break stuff - if people
<BR>
think I may be exaggerating, I saw supposed protesters
<BR>
- they were screaming and so on - and then later, when
<BR>
everything was over, the same people tackled other
<BR>
protestors and put handcuffs on them.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Witness account from the WTO protest
<BR>
This kind of thing, paired with the public view of
<BR>
activists as somewhat crazy, makes people not want to
<BR>
put any serious effort into causes they believe in. 
<BR>
One wonders if there aren't more &quot;armchair
<BR>
extropians&quot;, &quot;closet environmentalists&quot; and other
<BR>
sorts living in prohibitive environments where their
<BR>
voices cannot be heard, or perhaps only their voices
<BR>
cannot be heard, out of fear of violating social
<BR>
norms.  Even feeling strongly about things seems to be
<BR>
discouraged in the modern day- both from the popular
<BR>
cynicism that seems to be on the rise, and the idea
<BR>
that any effort of any kind is useless.  There is a
<BR>
large group of people who are politically independant
<BR>
but vote for either democrats or republicans as &quot;the
<BR>
lesser of two evils&quot; one of which will, &quot;inevitably
<BR>
win anyways.&quot;
<BR>
I suppose I should change the subject, at this point,
<BR>
from &quot;extinction&quot;, as I was originally going to title
<BR>
this article, to &quot;apathy&quot;, which is a more fitting
<BR>
term.  Not on any individual part, but on a social
<BR>
level, an aggregate and synergistic apathy, which
<BR>
pervades much of our society, and which when combined
<BR>
with a social structure that is supposedly open but
<BR>
secretely rigid in mentality, creates a powerful enemy.
