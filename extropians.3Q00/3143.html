<P><EM>    &gt;&gt; I've been thinking of switching recently - either to my
</EM><BR>
middle name, or to something completely new, like &quot;Ben Abard&quot;.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Don't do it Eliezer! I'll grant you that a normal person in
</EM><BR>
our culture with a name like &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; might be
<BR>
under a disadvantage, but you're not a normal person and your
<BR>
ideas are not of the average sort, so you should have an unusual
<BR>
name, it's an advantage. There once was a unsuccessful singer
<BR>
who had a mundane sounding name, I forget what it was but it
<BR>
was almost as dull and forgettable as &quot;John Clark&quot;, anyway he
<BR>
changed it to &quot;Engelbert Humperdink&quot; and immediately became very
<BR>
successful.  I think Arnold Schwarzeneger's name has helped him
<BR>
too.&lt;
<BR>
<P>I agree with John, except on two points:  First, &quot;John Clark&quot;
<BR>
is a solid name and one that conjures up a distinguished image.
<BR>
&nbsp;My father's name is John Clark and in his hay-day was an accomplished
<BR>
art director in New York city.  Perhaps I'm a bit biased (:-),
<BR>
but regardless, &quot;Clark&quot; is substantial, I think and it was my
<BR>
one-word signature for many years.  Second, although I really
<BR>
like Eli's name, he could reconfigure the letters in his name
<BR>
to create one word, two, or three words that are striking and
<BR>
memorable.
<BR>
<P>However, knowing Eliezer and the warm smile that illustrates
<BR>
his face, by keeping his original name he could surprise those
<BR>
who might expect a different sort of ideological baggage resorting
<BR>
from his name's tradition.
<BR>
<P>I also think Arnold Schwarzenegger's name helped him.  (By the
<BR>
way, Max and I saw him at the gym on Sunday and wow.)
<BR>
<P>FM Esfandiary changed his name and many couldn't make the connection
<BR>
to FM-2030.  Esfandiary conjured up a West Asian tradition which
<BR>
he wanted to shed, but which was pivital to much of his thinking
<BR>
and which spurred his visionary ideas about the future.  It was
<BR>
much of that region's dogma that he rebelled against which propelled
<BR>
his passions.
<BR>
<P>Natasha
<BR>
-- who didn't feel in sync with Nancie, but really is fond of
<BR>
Clark, however shedding it for Vita-More.
