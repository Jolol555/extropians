<EM>&gt;&gt;As a probably separate item:  The essense of the attraction of Christianity 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;was the forgiveness of sins.  Divine grace made it possible for the worst, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;most thoroughly evil sadistic mass murderer to be made into a &quot;new person
</EM><BR>
in 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Christ.&quot;  I don't know of any other religion that made such an offer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
This isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Suppose Hitler and his buddies had
<BR>
thrown themselves on the mercy of the Church and cried &quot;We're so sorry,
<BR>
will God forgive us&quot;, to which the Church would have been obliged to answer
<BR>
&quot;Of course, go in peace and sin no more&quot;.  Would this satisfy most people's
<BR>
expectation of justice?  Attractive yes, correct no.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Probably extropians tend to focus on the eternal life / fear of death 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;embodied in this near quote.  But the underlying reality is that washing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;away of sins by the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.  Only by washing away 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the sins could man be allowed into heaven.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
That would be assuming most Extropians use the Bible as the source of their
<BR>
philosophy, which they wouldn't.  I certainly wouldn't be involved in
<BR>
Transhumanism/Extropianism if it were.  In fact I've been a little
<BR>
disturbed with the discussions going on here of late with regard to using
<BR>
more religion-like methods for promoting THumanisn/Extropianism (which I
<BR>
believe wouldn't work.  New &quot;religions&quot; are rarely looked upon with favour
<BR>
by established ones.  We'd be incurring the wrath of just about every church).
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;But &quot;heaven&quot; is just an abstraction.  No one comes back to report to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;congregation on current weather or menus or musical fare in heaven.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;However, being &quot;saved&quot; has immediate social value, in that the other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Christians are bound to treat you as that &quot;new man.&quot;  Technically, since
</EM><BR>
God 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;has forgiven you, they can't second guess Him and off you for your prior 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;transgretions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
In theory perhaps, in practice most people went right on hating the
<BR>
&quot;sinner&quot; who was &quot;saved&quot;, to some degree for the reason I stated above
<BR>
(justice and such), or by using other religious tenets to maintain their
<BR>
hatred (&quot;Eye for an eye&quot; etc.....)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;And the church provided mechanisms - especially the early church or the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;catholic church in the Middle Ages - for peacefully resolving disputes and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;dealing with &quot;sins,&quot; separate from the civil process, but revolving around 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;this idea that your central relationship was with God, not your fellow man, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;so that once God had decided something, they interfered or ignored God's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;will at their peril.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
That &quot;seperate from the civil proces&quot; is the bit that worries me.  I've
<BR>
heard of several cases here in Ireland from back in the 60's/70's were
<BR>
people would approach the CHURCH for greivances with particular priests
<BR>
&quot;often related to child sex abuse&quot;, instead of the proper civil
<BR>
authorities.  Of course, most of the time they were either hushed up or
<BR>
told to shut up.  People getting told &quot;Don't concern yourself with it, it's
<BR>
in our hands now.  Hardly peaceful.  We've had the &quot;seperate from the civil
<BR>
process&quot; system at times, and it's NOT pretty.  I'm relieved that we've
<BR>
moved away from that sort of dispute resolution.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Not that I believe any of the above - just to make that clear.  But this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;whole central aspect to Christianity especially tends to be ignored by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;non-Christians, I've noticed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;_
</EM><BR>
Incorrect.  As you can see from my comments, these aspects are all too well
<BR>
known to non-Christians, often as the result of harsh personal experience.
<BR>
There is little redeeming about what most religions teach.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I understand you're not endorsing religion, and are just stating
<BR>
the above points.  I just think it's important to show the downsides to
<BR>
those points, and how easily they are abused.
<BR>
<P>Slan,
<BR>
<P><P><P>James....
