</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the rules stipulate that the person can never find out
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; me. So, I can only assume that whoever is running the competition is
</EM><BR>
going
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to do something rather frightful to me, to enforce that rule, because
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know I'm going to try to violate it (I've posted it in a public forum
</EM><BR>
after
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all).

Hal replied:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you're over-analyzing the situation.  There is no presumption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that someone will put out a contract on you.  Simpler to assume that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the recipient has no basis for believing your claim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point is, do you favor or oppose someone else's good luck, if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a net benefit to the group as a whole.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was trying to make a (flippantly presented) point about the
<BR>
interconnectedness of things in an economy. If things are not
<BR>
interconnected, then of course I'd always say &quot;yes&quot;. But the point of the
<BR>
question, and the common response, is that people make their decision based
<BR>
on how they think it'll affect them personally.
