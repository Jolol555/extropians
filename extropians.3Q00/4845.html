<P><EM>&gt;Now, since I've just finished my sometimes discussed about in hushed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whispers business plan for the development of biotech based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-replicating systems I'll toss my vote in for the *dark horse*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The *dark horse* will be based on light harvesting methods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;currently found in plants.  Once these systems are cloned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and available as easily manipulated laboratory tools, scientists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will develop energy harvesting, storage and production systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;based on biotechnology based self-replicating systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This solves the problems of production costs, capital costs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;etc. that have plagued other renewable energy sources.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will not be simple, but the payoff is big! Really big! -- being able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to &quot;paint on&quot; your power generation system that is self-organizing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-repairing and entirely local (producing revenue if it is connected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the grid...) argue that this is the way to go.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Self-Replicating systems beat overcoming gravity.  No contest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The market is clear -- you can have grass that you have to mow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or you can have grass that pumps excess energy into the grid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which do you prefer?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;While I would love to see the energy storage and retrieval aspects solved by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;high temperature superconductors, I suspect that they will first be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;solved by biotech (with horrible losses compensated for by the large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;collection areas enabled by self-replicating systems) and the subsequently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improved upon by much more efficient systems based on diamondoid nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>Chloroplasts (in eucaryotes) and cyanobacteria (procaryotes) harvest energy
<BR>
from light.  Cellular ion pumps create voltage gradients across membranes.
<BR>
Cellular organelles (ribosomes and ?) produce a variety of  energy-storing
<BR>
fuel candidates: ATP, oils, methane, methanol, ethanol, and others.  The
<BR>
DNA bio-code for these particular products and processes and the structures
<BR>
which mediate them, can now be identified, isolated, elucidated, precisely
<BR>
customized, reproduced, and then systematically mass-produced.  
<BR>
<P>Though arguably a non-trivial process (everything's hard till...), these
<BR>
disparate pieces of biological evolution, along with whatever
<BR>
post-biological modifications prove advantageous, can be envisioned
<BR>
conjoined to create never-before-seen-or-even-imagined, truly &quot;engineered&quot;,
<BR>
biological-yet-synthetic organisms.  Every code variation across a spectrum
<BR>
of billions of different organisms from virus to whale, from radiodurans to
<BR>
cubic kilometer matrices of a single fungus--the largest individual
<BR>
organisms yet discovered--each piece of DNA a life-tested-and-proven asset
<BR>
in the bio-engineering inventory.  As a technophile and gadgeteer, a lover
<BR>
of hardware departments, junk yards, and laboratory-gizmos-R-us emporiums,
<BR>
the vision of this vast-beyond-imagining biological tool kit sets my heart
<BR>
to racing.  No Christmas-eve-wonder-intoxicated tyke was ever more excited
<BR>
and impatient--and less inclined to sleep.  
<BR>
<P>SHOW ME THE MAGIC!
<BR>
<P>The dark horse races through the velvet night, chasing the star-lit
<BR>
infinite, to the coming dawn.
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
