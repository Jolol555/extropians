<EM>&gt; There is less scope for being &quot;right&quot; in disagreements about values. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once we understand what we want, and opponents decide they don't want 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, there isn't that much more to say to them. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Wei responds:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; People's values seem to be derived from some set of fundamental values,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the facts that they believe to be true. So we can convince people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we are &quot;right&quot; about values in two ways. The first is to convince
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them of a new set of facts, and the second is to convince them that their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derived values are not consistent with their fundamental values and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beliefs about facts. As an example, if you convince a theist that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are no gods, that would probably change a number of his values.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Robin's &quot;values&quot; are more like what you are calling &quot;fundamental
<BR>
values&quot;.  These would be the core beliefs people have which are relatively
<BR>
immune to change.  Then I think your formula is consistent with Robin's
<BR>
formulation: given the values (fundamental values) and (believed) facts,
<BR>
people can come up with a judgement about how attractive the situation is.
