<EM>&gt; .&gt; Personally, if the man was lied to, then the woman should either be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; forced to either abort, OR accept the father's dissolution of rights and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support. That is a perfectly fair reproductive choice to make.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think every unplanned pregnancy was because &quot;the man was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lied to&quot; by the woman. I find it peculiar that you would explain away two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consenting adults with such a devious explanation. (I doubt that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  situations are due to such Jerry Springer antics)The two parties both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participated in the risk,(and everyone does know the risks, both man and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woman) There are many reasons that an unwanted pregnancy could result.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I don't believe it would be fair to force an abortion on a woman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (physical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and emotional trauma) and I highly doubt that abortions will ever be forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on anyone (excluding medical emergency, which still isn't forced). Legally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's just not going to take. Your other 'alternative/choice&quot; is that if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refuses abortion, that she should then take care of the child, (who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his as well) while he shouldn't have to contribute emotional or financial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsibility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, I'm sure this is gonna piss off at least a few of the women on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the list. I personally think that the lack of application of consent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here is a major legal hole.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Funny you should say that (about to puke) your reasonable (in pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jest) 'resolution' of such a situation is shockingly selfish, not only in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaving all consequences on the female of the -two- who took the risk,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but for the child as well. It's as if your scenario implies she had sex with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; herself. (I smell cop out)
</EM><BR>
<P>I assume that you have not been following the discussion to date, so
<BR>
I'll let the snide commentary slide. I was in no way assuming that every
<BR>
unplanned pregnancy is because the man was 'lied to'. In cases, however,
<BR>
where there is a clear situation of fraud on the part of the  woman, if
<BR>
not outright force (and female rapes of males do occur, both statutorily
<BR>
and between adults, as the previously cited case of the passed out male
<BR>
shows), then the male should have the EXACT same option to either
<BR>
terminate the pregnancy or be exempted from parental
<BR>
responsibilities/support as women do who have been lied to or raped.
<BR>
Insisting on anything more biased is plainly sexist.

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
