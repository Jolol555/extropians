<EM>&gt; Why shouldn't the lawmakers who passed the &quot;safe storage laws...or the gun

<EM>&gt; held responsible for what OTHER PEOPLE DO...of their own free will.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bar owners are held responsible for what OTHE PEOPLE DO of their own free

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why shouldn't  legislators be held responsible for the unintended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences of what they FORCE PEOPLE  to do?
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent question. However, considering that the damage of harmful legislation is
<BR>
not directed intentionally at any individual, then normal common law practices
<BR>
would not apply, although class action mandamus lawsuits would be possible, and
<BR>
such are currently being pursued at this moment against Janet Reno, Louis Freeh,
<BR>
and the rest for illegal use of NICS gun purchase queries. Violators of mandamus
<BR>
court orders can be held personally liable for their refusal to obey mandamus
<BR>
orders. The difficulty is that such orders can only be issued against individual
<BR>
bureaucrats or politicians, and not against anyone who may hold their office after
<BR>
them, although they can be issued against whole departments, etc, which may solve
<BR>
that problem. Furthermore, you may also pursue legal action against politicians as
<BR>
crimes against humanity if they violate the UN Universal Declaration of Human
<BR>
Rights, however the right to keep and bear arms has not been elucidated in it, only
<BR>
the right to defend oneself (not exactly the same thing).
<BR>
<P>One concept that strikes my fancy is out of H Beam Piper's _Lone Star Planet_,
<BR>
where citizens had the right to kill a politician if they could prove that he/she
<BR>
'needed killing' because of the politicians disregard for the rights of their
<BR>
fellow man.
