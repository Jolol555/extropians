<EM>&gt; &gt;What does that mean, though? If you are going to build a do-it-yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;guardian (in the sense of Plato - it was Plato, wasn't it?) then I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that's bad news; the best outcome we can hope for is failure. It's also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bloody arrogant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, it was Plato; and no, I am not proposing a ruling elite of guardians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for as the saying goes &quot;Who guards the guardians?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Excellent
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you are going to become one....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yep. It's the logical extension of all Transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, greater control over our own presents and futures is the goal of
<BR>
Transhumanism (I think). Some people define this as Godhood. This is a bit
<BR>
lazy intellectually, more below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;...you either envisage being such a guardian,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or maybe raising everyone up to equal status.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;In the egalitarian case, where is godhood? It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;more powerful beings, sure, but a society of such. So the concept of God
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not useful in that context.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree. It is Olympian. A society of Gods. Such Gods are defined as
</EM><BR>
such
<BR>
<EM>&gt; by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traditional attributes of divinity: immortality, omnipotence, omniscience,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and so forth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I rather the fancy the idea of Zeus Eleutherios, &quot;Zeus the Liberator.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Godhood implies perfection, and requires all these absolute abilities;
<BR>
immortality, omnipotence, omniscience, are good examples.
<BR>
<P>Really, though, we can never be immortal, omnipotent, or omniscient. We can
<BR>
live a long time (1000s of years?), we can have much more power over the
<BR>
universe (moving stellar bodies around), we can know a lot of things (what's
<BR>
going on at the atomic level in a star on the other side of the galaxy). But
<BR>
we are fundamentally limited, and always will be.
<BR>
<P>These &quot;godly&quot; attributes are the limit; we can approach the limit, but never
<BR>
achieve it. That's ok; we can always improve, and the journey should be
<BR>
mighty wild! But godhood is not a sensible thing to talk about in this
<BR>
context; it's just a big ego trip.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Basically, the concept of God is all about authority, control, dominance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's your concept, not mine. Different definitions define our
</EM><BR>
differences.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>What's your definition? Being able to do mighty stuff? Then we are gods
<BR>
compared to our cave dwelling ancestors. Is it useful to sit around dwelling
<BR>
on our comparative godhood in that context? I don't think so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Gods will not help us where we are going. But they could seriously stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;things up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Godhood is precisely where we are going, as I defined it above. Some of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might get there before others. If I get there before you, Emlyn, would you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a hand up and some friendly advice, or shall I let you take the long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way 'round and arrive later after much unnecessary travail? I believe in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free will and so will not compel you to join us on Olympus. But I would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; delighted to help you if I can.
</EM><BR>
<P>If I remember the stories about Olympus correctly, the inhabitants exhibited
<BR>
decidedly mortal character flaws, although perhaps in godly proportion.
<BR>
Certainly, there was a rather large helping of arrogance, and an uncommonly
<BR>
large amount of smiting going on. Kind of like Melrose Place with nuclear
<BR>
weapons. No thanks.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the green movement will be uploading me shortly, so I should do ok.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Anyone but&quot; Emlyn
