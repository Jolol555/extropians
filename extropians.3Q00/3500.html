<EM>&gt; Peace through techno-transendence. Will wars become a form of entertainment 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the did in ancient and not so ancient days, because of cheap robots and

<P>Expert: US Open To Bioterrorism
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (AP) _ Advances in technology make the United States
<BR>
more vulnerable to bioterrorism than to nuclear attack, a leading
<BR>
expert in defending against biological weapons said Tuesday.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Tara O'Toole, deputy director of Johns Hopkins University's
<BR>
Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, suggested devoting $30
<BR>
billion over the next 10 years to prepare health care systems to
<BR>
detect, track, respond and contain epidemics that would be
<BR>
triggered by biological weapons.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Health and Human Services says it is spending
<BR>
$278 million this fiscal year to prepare for bioterrorism.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``The likelihood of a biological weapon being used is a lot
<BR>
higher than a missile coming across the Pacific,'' O'Toole said.
<BR>
``And yet we are spending a lot more on missile defense than we are
<BR>
on biological systems.''
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``A bio Unibomber is perfectly possible, and that threat will
<BR>
grow because of the growing power of biotechnology and genomics,''
<BR>
she said in a discussion at the independent Center for Strategic
<BR>
and International Studies.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spurred by the spread of computers, the Internet and large
<BR>
corporations searching for medical miracles, biotechnical advances
<BR>
are moving much faster than physics did in the 1950s, O'Toole said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genetic research to develop new drugs could ``create the tools
<BR>
to build a more powerful weapon and virulent bug,'' she said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple devices such as a nasal spray could spread a deadly
<BR>
disease such as anthrax, underscoring the difficulty of detecting
<BR>
biological weapons before their use.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Toole said the United States needs to strengthen its public
<BR>
health and medical care system to deal with biological attacks
<BR>
because this would ``probably make ourselves less attractive
<BR>
targets to would-be perpetrators.''
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A byproduct of such an effort, she said, would be an improvement
<BR>
in the everyday functioning of hospitals and other health care
<BR>
systems, because new medical devices and treatments would be
<BR>
developed.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Toole recommended a robust research and development program to
<BR>
reduce vulnerability to biological weapons using resources of the
<BR>
departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``We've also got to engage the genius of the universities, the
<BR>
pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies, who are not now
<BR>
in this game,'' she said. ``They are not running around looking for
<BR>
cures for anthrax. There is no market reason to do so.''
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research program should focus on three areas, she
<BR>
recommended:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Developing an automated means to diagnose disease-causing
<BR>
organisms by using microchips.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Producing better vaccines, more vaccines and new antibiotics
<BR>
and particularly anti-viral drugs for likely bioagents.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Enhancing immune response generally ``so we can get `one-bug,
<BR>
one-drug' and see if we can find a more all-purpose way to limit
<BR>
our susceptibility to infectious disease.''
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public health experts have warned for several years that
<BR>
bioterrorism, the release of deadly bacteria or viruses, is a
<BR>
growing threat. While the government knows how to respond to
<BR>
chemical spills or bombings, bioterrorism could be the ultimate
<BR>
sneak attack: no one would know it had happened until sick people
<BR>
began arriving at hospitals.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not a theoretical risk. In 1985, a cult sickened 750 people
<BR>
by poisoning salad bars in Oregon with the food-poisoning germ
<BR>
salmonella. In 1995, experts say Japanese doomsday cultists tried
<BR>
but failed to release botulism toxin and anthrax in Tokyo. The same
<BR>
cult later released nerve gas into a subway and killed 12 people
<BR>
and made thousands sick.
