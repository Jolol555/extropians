<P>Mike- 
<BR>
<P>One of the advantatages of working in the cosmic dust field, is that I
<BR>
have special access to all of the dust jokes. Sometimes,
<BR>
unintentionally.
<BR>
<P>During one of my first dust talks, a couple of years ago at a
<BR>
conference in Slovakia, I was having some trouble removing a piece of
<BR>
dust that had stubbornly attached itself to one of my viewgraphs,
<BR>
which was about the Jovian dust streams.
<BR>
<P>The irony of my trying to remove a piece of dust on my viewgraph,
<BR>
which was all about dust, was not lost on some of my audience. In
<BR>
particular, there was a group of people in the back that were laughing
<BR>
so hard, that they almost fell off of their chairs. And I didn't know
<BR>
what they were finding so funny, and I was flustered and embarassed
<BR>
about my stuborn piece of dust!
<BR>
<P>I did survive my talk, and one of them told me afterwards what they
<BR>
found so funny. It seems that I was a perfect straight man in a comedy
<BR>
skit during my own presentation, unintentionally.
<BR>
<P>Since then, I use dust jokes, whenver possible. I put every dust joke
<BR>
I could think of, including the &quot;dust bunnies under the bed&quot; joke in
<BR>
my Sky and Telescope interplanetary dust article, that I wrote this
<BR>
summer. I don't know what, in the article, will finally appear in
<BR>
print (or when it will appear in print), but I hope that they keep my
<BR>
dust jokes...
