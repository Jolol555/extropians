<P>
<EM>&gt; If I get a good idea an express it in some kind of medium, and I am really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good at it. In fact the best. Like I make the best computers, the best car,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the best song etc. I kan sell this expression of my idea. Then I have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incentive to spend my time to get better ideas. Just like the carrot in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stick and carrot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if it was legal for everyboy to use my idea like they would see fit,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then some other guy would just copy the expression of my idea and make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; identical copies. Cars like mine, songs like mine. Then I would only make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half as much money from my idea. Even at the same price.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe so.  What's your point?  Seriously, &quot;Creators make more money
<BR>
with copyrights&quot; is not an excuse.  I've never disputed that, just as
<BR>
farmers with subsidies make more than farmers without.  The question
<BR>
is whether it is better /as a policy/ to have these laws or not.  You
<BR>
contend that there will be &quot;insufficient&quot; incentive to create without
<BR>
copyright.  Despite that being vague and unmeasurable, it is clearly
<BR>
contradicted by the plain evidence of marvellous amounts of creative
<BR>
work that happened before the recent adoption of copyright.  As I've
<BR>
also pointed out, creators themselves benefit from absence of copyright
<BR>
because they too have a richer public domain from which to draw.  All
<BR>
creative work is derivative, after all.B
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The other guy who has made copies has had no R&amp;D costs so he can sell it at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any price he wants, and still make a profit. If there is ten other guys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copying it there will shurely be a price that is so low that I would never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make my R&amp;D costs back.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, without copyright long-term speculative R&amp;D becomes a bad investment,
<BR>
and most creative work will change from  big-leap innovation to small,
<BR>
incremental improvement.  Evolution rather than revolution.  Craftsmanship
<BR>
rather than novelty for its own sake.  Copyrights and patents increase the
<BR>
value of novelty for its own sake.  I'm not sure that's a good thing.
<BR>
Progress is good, but wouldn't all progress be better if more of it were
<BR>
incremental rather than revolutionary?  It certainly would be less likely
<BR>
to have unexpected side effects, and be easier to integrate into society.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then why on earth should I try to get new ideas, and express them in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of medium?? The smart thing would be to wait until somebody else has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed it and then leech off of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Without numbers and examples, this is nothing more than the constant cry
<BR>
of the Luddite: &quot;people will lost jobs&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well we have a system right now that works. Not perfect but it works.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a matter of opinion.  I think it's fundamentally broken.  I can't
<BR>
get the information I want, and people are being sued for trying to
<BR>
provide access to information.  Education is outrageously expensive, and
<BR>
craftsmanship and service are disappearing.  The system is broken.
<BR>
