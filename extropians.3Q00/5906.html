<P><EM>&gt; Show me a live intelligent being completely lacking motivation.

<P>You're right. Buddha is dead. So, of course we must create a Kurzweilian
<BR>
Spiritual Machine.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;`There's this robotics engineer named Masahiro Mori who wrote a book called The
<BR>
Buddha in the Robot. Mori describes driving a car and realizing that there was
<BR>
no way to know whether he was driving the car or the car was driving him. To
<BR>
drive, you have to move your hands and feet in a manner that's determined by the
<BR>
car, not by you. It's a field-ground thing, like those drawings that look like a
<BR>
young woman from one perspective and a hag from another. Mori has a great quote.
<BR>
Let's see, I got it around here somewhere.' He stood up and started routing
<BR>
through his machines, finally pulling out a grey palmtop case and unfolding it
<BR>
like a plastic bat-wing. `Friend of mine gave me this. It's called Ariel. A
<BR>
prototype.' He turned toward the machine. `Ariel, read me Mori's quote about
<BR>
robots.' `The description of Mori's professional work or the passage concerning
<BR>
Buddha-nature?' asked Ariel in a slightly metallic female voice. `The latter.'
<BR>
`Mori states, that which controls and that which is controlled are both
<BR>
manifestations of the buddha-nature.' `We must not consider that we ourselves
<BR>
are operating machines. What is happening is that the buddha-nature is operating
<BR>
the buddha-nature. From the Buddha's viewpoint, there is not master-slave
<BR>
relationship between human beings and machines. The two are fused together in an
<BR>
interlocking entirety. Man achieves dignity not by subjugating his mechanical
<BR>
inventions, but by recognizing in machines and robots the same buddha-nature
<BR>
that pervades his own inner self.'

<P>Recently I visited a Zen temple and had a long talk with the
<BR>
priest.  In the course of our conversation, I remarked, 'The more
<BR>
I study robots, the less it seems possible to me that the spirit
<BR>
and flesh are separate entities.'
<BR>
<P>'They aren't,' replied the priest.&quot;
