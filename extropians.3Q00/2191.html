<EM>&gt; &gt; After all, money is important only insofar as it is a means to an end,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and if you can short-circuit the process and get at the end itself, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; needs money?

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Hey, I'm with you... I'd love to get past money.  And we will, eventually.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I don't think that we can pretend that it isn't currently a tremendously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful thing, and curiosity and respect of peers doesn't put food on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; table.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is one of the most popular myths in the artistic/humanities
<BR>
communities, that we will someday 'get past money', as seen by the
<BR>
claims of the writers of tv shows like Star Trek: TNG, etc. in their
<BR>
dialog. Cash money is an incredibly powerful tool, and in this age of
<BR>
the electronic big brother, is the only true means of maintaining some
<BR>
semblance of anonymity in your economic transactions (so long as you
<BR>
yourself don't obtain that cash from a federally insured
<BR>
bank/thrift/S&amp;L/credit union). 
<BR>
<P>As I have said before, anything that behaves like money, that does the
<BR>
job of money, is in fact money. &quot;money&quot; is merely a discriptor for a
<BR>
tool that symbolizes value. &quot;Getting past money&quot; would require a quantum
<BR>
shift in the perception of all humanity about how important it is that
<BR>
all/most/large transactions be considered 'fair' in value exchange
<BR>
between parties. This is essentially requiring the destruction of the
<BR>
Baysian paradigm.
