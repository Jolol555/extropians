<EM>&gt; &gt; Transparency works with IP, not against it.  Yes, you can watch David

<EM>&gt; &gt; Brin write his next novel as it's being written.  But the police can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; see you performing an illegal observation, and arrest you for watching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, but: if there are such things as illegal observations, then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fail to have 100% transparency.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all.  There could be 100% transparency in fact, but making use
<BR>
of this transparency could nontheless be made illegal.  (Brin, to the
<BR>
best of my knowledge, has never said otherwise.)  Think of it as an
<BR>
all-seeing society with its eyes taped shut.
<BR>
<P>Here's an obvious scenario leading to illegal transparency: if
<BR>
surveilance technology ever becomes as ubiquitous and cheap as David
<BR>
Brin thinks that it might be, Congress could pass laws prohibiting
<BR>
certain kinds of observations or the use of certain kinds of equipment
<BR>
on the grounds of &quot;protecting personal privacy&quot;; these laws would be
<BR>
funded by special interest groups with secrets to keep and would even
<BR>
be supported by a large fraction of the populace, perhaps even a
<BR>
majority.  (Who wants some pervert watching your every move?)
<BR>
<P>Of course, for their next trick, the government could completely
<BR>
eliminate the black market for surveilance equipment by monopolizing
<BR>
its use, er, I mean, limiting its use to select law enforcement
<BR>
officials only.  It's to keep the streets safer, you see.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The example you cited is minor; a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significant one would be, say, making it illegal for non-police to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; observe an arrest (which means that anyone taping an arrest to prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police brutality would have illegal evidence, inadmissable in a court of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From the rest of your post, it seems that you agree - except that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not, techncially, transparency, since transparency goes both ways.
</EM><BR>
<P>Be careful to keep the distinction between &quot;cheap ubiquitous
<BR>
surveilance technology&quot; and the society David Brin describes clear.
<BR>
Transparency is merely the former.  Transparency is not necessarily
<BR>
David Brin's utopia.
