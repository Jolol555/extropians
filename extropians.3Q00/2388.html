<P><EM>&gt; Linux is very nice but it is a tool somebody has made so they don't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay for the tools from other. Free hammers would also be nice for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carpentry business but would destroy the hammer business. So you can turn it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around and say that if people want free music they should make it themself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just like the Linux crowd supposedly does.

<P>Here is the difference, about the software/hammer analogy.  Making two copies of
<BR>
a software is a marginal action.  Making two copies of a hammer requires twice
<BR>
the quantities the comprise the hammer.  Also, making a hammer requires forging,
<BR>
casting, or machining the hammer head and possibly the handle, or carving the
<BR>
handle.
<BR>
<P>So, both software and hammer have start-up costs, the software's fixed costs
<BR>
being the programming time and code and test platforms which are mostly reused
<BR>
or reusable, while the hammer has the fixed costs of the machines and tools to
<BR>
make the hammer.
<BR>
<P>After the fixed costs, reproducing software is basically a costless operation.
<BR>
<P>I see those as obvious statements.
<BR>
<P>Linux or the other free UNIXs were not free, they are made from thousands upon
<BR>
thousands of programmer hours and precursor code, they were just freely given.
<BR>
<P>There is a concept of sum societal utility.  Linux, free, has contributed to the
<BR>
sum societal utility many times over its investment given by volunteer
<BR>
programmers and supporters, some might say.  Some statistics have it running
<BR>
half the Internet.
<BR>
<P>Copyright laws are in place for a reason, and most of them are good laws.  Some
<BR>
patent laws, in my opinion, are cumbersome and infringe upon the growth of sum
<BR>
societal utility, and any patent should expire in twelve years.
