<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; What is all this tripe about those who want your vote?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Incidentally, another question for all the USAnians; has there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ever been an American presidential election where a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;candidate has won on the absolute count of popular votes, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but has lost because of the way those votes were divided in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the electoral college? 
</EM><BR>
<P>There have been 4 US elections in which the system produced results that
<BR>
were not as transparent as the founders might have hoped.
<BR>
<P>The following is based on info in the book _After the People Vote_,
<BR>
which has a nice summary of the history.  Published by American
<BR>
Enterprise Institute.  A nice, useful book whether or not you agree with
<BR>
AEI's conservative views or the book's pro-Electoral College views.
<BR>
&lt; <A HREF="http://www.aei.org/shop1/shops/1/a-c.htm">http://www.aei.org/shop1/shops/1/a-c.htm</A> &gt;
<BR>
<P>Year Candidates           Party
<BR>
<P>1888 Benjamin Harrison    Republican  233 electoral votes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grover Cleveland     Democrat    168 electoral votes
<BR>
<P>This is the only example of a truly &quot;undemocratic&quot; result, since
<BR>
Cleveland won the popular vote (by a whisker).  Oddly, it is also the
<BR>
case that occasioned the least carping.  The choice of Harrison was
<BR>
accepted with reasonable grace by most people, including Cleveland (who
<BR>
won handily four years later), and life went on as usual.  Presumably
<BR>
there would be more carping nowadays.
<BR>
<P><P>1876 Rutherford B. Hayes  Republican
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuel J. Tilden     Democrat
<BR>
<P>Tilden won the popular vote, and would have won the electoral vote too
<BR>
except for some pretty ruthless and corrupt scheming on the part of the
<BR>
Radical Republicans.  In the end, they managed to bribe and/or threaten
<BR>
a few carpetbagger Republican governors in the South -- recall that this
<BR>
was only 11 years after the end of the Civil War -- into submitting
<BR>
&quot;revised&quot; election returns.  This created a constitutional crisis,
<BR>
because there was no procedure for deciding which returns (and thus
<BR>
which electors) to accept, making it impossible to hold an electoral
<BR>
vote that would be accepted as legitimate by most people.
<BR>
<P>The House and Senate were controlled by different parties, and could not
<BR>
reach a negotiated settlement.  A 15-member commission was appointed to
<BR>
examine the credentials of the disputed electors.  It started out with 7
<BR>
Democrats, 7 Republicans and 1 independent (a Supreme Court Justice).
<BR>
<P>The Republicans found an ingenious way to eliminate the independent --
<BR>
they arranged to get him elected to the Senate by the legislature of his
<BR>
state.  He was succeeded by a new Justice who was a Republican, and the
<BR>
commission votes followed straight party lines 8-7 for Hayes, who won
<BR>
the electoral vote.  Needless to say, this outraged the Democratic
<BR>
South, where the populace refused to accept the result; they finally did
<BR>
agree to accept it, but only at a hefty price: the withdrawal of the
<BR>
carpetbag administrations and the end of Reconstruction.
<BR>
<P><P>1824 John Quincy Adams    84 electoral votes, 30.0% of popular vote
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Jackson       99 electoral votes, 44.3% of popular vote
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William H. Crawford  41 electoral votes, 13.2% of popular vote
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Clay           39 electoral votes, 12.5% of popular vote
<BR>
<P>Since 131 electoral votes were needed for a majority, the election ended
<BR>
up in the House of Representatives.  Most members of the House favored
<BR>
Henry Clay (Speaker of the House), but the Constitution limited them to
<BR>
considering only the three top electoral contenders (Twelfth Amendment).
<BR>
After some classic smoke-filled room politics, Adams was chosen.
<BR>
Jackson was understandably peeved; popular resentment over the result
<BR>
contributed to his decisive victory four years later.
<BR>
<P><P>1800 Thomas Jefferson     Democratic Republican  73 electoral votes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Burr           Democratic Republican  73 electoral votes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Adams           Federalist             65 electoral votes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Pinckney     Federalist             64 electoral votes
<BR>
<P>The rule at the time was that the winner of the electoral vote became
<BR>
President, and the runner-up became Vice President.  The intention of
<BR>
the &quot;doubling up&quot; above was to permit one party to hold both offices.
<BR>
<P>Things went seriously awry.  Jefferson and Burr ended up in a tie, so
<BR>
the Constitutional rule could not be applied.  Neither candidate would
<BR>
consent to taking second place, so the election went to the House of
<BR>
Representatives, which was controlled by the Federalists.
<BR>
<P>The Federalists dearly wanted to overturn the electoral vote entirely
<BR>
and choose the Adams-Pinckney ticket [this is before the Twelfth
<BR>
Amendment], but were prevented from doing so despite their House
<BR>
majority because of another Constitutional rule: the House had to vote
<BR>
by state, one state one vote.  The House votes also ended in ties, and
<BR>
no amount of wheeling and dealing seemed able to break the deadlock.
<BR>
Thomas Jefferson was finally selected on the 36th ballot, and Aaron Burr
<BR>
became VP, after personal intervention by the Federalist Alexander
<BR>
Hamilton (of all people).
<BR>
<P>The Twelfth Amendment was adopted almost immediately to prevent such an
<BR>
occurrence in the future.  It required separate votes for Pres and VP.
<BR>
<P>**********
<BR>
<P>Another thing that some might find interesting is testimony submitted
<BR>
recently to the House Judiciary Committee in the matter of a couple of
<BR>
proposals to amend the Constitution to abolish the Electoral College.
<BR>
<P>&lt; <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/judiciary/222311.htm">http://www.house.gov/judiciary/222311.htm</A> &gt; for a list of witnesses and
<BR>
separate presentations of testimony.  Panel 1 has 2 witnesses, both
<BR>
supporting abolition.  Panel 2 has 4 witnesses, 1 supporting abolition
<BR>
and 3 opposing it.  All presenters are articulate exponents of the
<BR>
positions they represent, and together they give a pretty clear picture
<BR>
of what the best arguments are on each side.
<BR>

<BR>
for a transcript, if you want all of the testimony in a single document.
