</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Yes, but then we're talking about two different projects. Since the
<BR>
fork was provoked by a screwup on manager's part, one of them seems
<BR>
destined to crash and burn. There *are* a number of OpenSource
<BR>
screwups out there.

<EM> &gt; &gt; Anarchic software development does not work.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Define &quot;anarchic&quot;.  No body of law ties, say, Linux developers to Linus
</EM><BR>
<P>Headless. No central arbitrator. Everybody can touch everything, and
<BR>
distribute the end result under the same name. I'm not saying it can't
<BR>
work theoretically, but lacking angels it doesn't seem to work in
<BR>
practice.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Torvaldis.  Linus can not hire or fire developers; he can only make
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; acceptance of their code more or less likely.  (He can't even absolutely
</EM><BR>
<P>A great damn deal more or less likely. You try putting something into
<BR>
the kernel what Linus (or Alan Cox, or any of the core team) thinks is
<BR>
wrong.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; reject software on his own, though his negative review can go a long way
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; towards rejecting certain code.)  Promises, trust, and working code are
</EM><BR>
<P>Code that works for you might not work for me, and vice
<BR>
versa. Architectural decisions are frequently incompatible.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; all that unify the developers - and this lack of law is, technically,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;anarchy&quot;, in the form that some promoters of anarchy envision as their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; utopia.
</EM><BR>
<P>I still see no evidence that there are nontrivial OpenSource projects
<BR>
which work by pure anarchy. Can you name an example?
