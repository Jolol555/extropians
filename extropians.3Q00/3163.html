<EM>&gt; However, I would never change my name to something easier to spell, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pronounce, or to anything more common. One of the best assets you can have

<EM>&gt; these days, in the massively crammed namespace of the net, is a weird name.

<P>Yes, my mother has often wished she had spelled my name as her swedish great
<BR>
grandfather's name was spelled: Mikel. My father tells me that when he was in
<BR>
the Army, he hung out with a lot of italian guys from Boston and New York, and
<BR>
because he loved italian food so much (and his italian mother was such a good
<BR>
cook) that the italian guys called him Norm Lorrelli.
<BR>
<P>However, I can't help but laugh at people who have plainly spelled names but try
<BR>
to pronounce them oddly. For example, a girlfriend from high school was named
<BR>
Andrea, no biggie. However she insisted that people pronounce it
<BR>
'ahhhwn-dree-ah'.... boooring...
