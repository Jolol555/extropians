<EM>&gt; Lets see, why do I live in a city?  1) I don't have to own a car, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is adequate public transit.  2) There is a 24 hour restaurant down
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the block, and several 24 hour convenience stores within a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blocks.  3) There is, within walking distance, two cafes, 10 restarants, 4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fast-food joints, a major mall, and three different computer stores. 4)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is a wide diversity of different people that I can end up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interacting with.  5) I can buy ingredients for greek, lebanese, chinese,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Caribean food without leaving my home suburb.  6) High Bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet service is readily available.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right, I love that same sort of stuff about cities too. Public
<BR>
transport is a big one; I'm about to move to somewhere that I need a car
<BR>
again, gack. Decent cafe's are a must!
<BR>
<P>I wonder if it's all about food; I hate working, for instance, in an area
<BR>
without good restaurants/cafes. I worked in an industrial area for over a
<BR>
year, horrible, the only food in walking distance came from one of two awful
<BR>
takeaways (one of which turned out to be under a brothel; that's Canberra
<BR>
for you), or microwaved crappola from a service station. A year of hell.
<BR>
<P>Big cities are really fun to live in if you have no kids and are fighting
<BR>
fit. For a family, it's a bit of a bummer; everything costs more, and it's a
<BR>
little wilder than might be desirable.
<BR>
<P>I've been looking at some of the beatiful rural towns around Australia, for
<BR>
instance on the south coast of New South Wales. It's paradise, rainforest,
<BR>
just amazing. But I think if you are a little way inland, even though it is
<BR>
beautiful, the towns are struggling. Why? No jobs, no opportunities.
<BR>
<P>I think you could turn around a couple of towns like that by turning them
<BR>
into high-tech havens. Bring in broadband, subsidize or start business which
<BR>
appealed to techies/tech companies, and try to attract higher class
<BR>
restaurants, cafes, etc. Maybe you could try to attract tech companies to
<BR>
base themselves there, or at least build really top teleworking
<BR>
infrastructure, to attract teleworkers.
<BR>
<P>Really we'd need a better teleworking industry to make that a goer. Better
<BR>
get back to it...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I can understand it if you live in Singapore, for instance, or Macau,
</EM><BR>
but I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't get it in a country like Australia, or the US for that matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There's space. The cars are fast; build a few more highways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of us think there are already too many highways.
</EM><BR>
<P>I do hate driving myself. But then, I'm trying something different.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Personally I love a dense city; they're interesting places to be in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stimulating. But they are really irritating if you have to fight your
</EM><BR>
way
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; through them every day.
