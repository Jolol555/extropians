There's a much more basic method of grabbing heavily encrypted music which
<BR>
is downloaded and played by your PC. You can write a fake device driver that
<BR>
takes the unencrypted digital information fed to it (necessary to actually
<BR>
play the music), and instead write the information to a nice little
<BR>
unencrypted file, say a (really huge) wav file.
<BR>
<P>I know, because I've used a program that was kicking around for Windows NT
<BR>
(can't remember it's name), to save full CD-quality streaming audio from a
<BR>
Metallica site, no less. They had their recent full double album (S&amp;M)
<BR>
available in this fashion; maybe they still do. The particular program I use
<BR>
installed itself as a device driver, and popped the music in a wav. All I
<BR>
had to do was say to the site that I had a T1 connection, then wait quite a
<BR>
while, and voila! Full CD quality (44.1KHz?) sound.
<BR>
<P>The machine I did this on has a CD burner attached; I could have made full
<BR>
replica CDs from this source (actually, the breaks between songs would be
<BR>
different, but that's really nitpicking). What I did do was convert them to
<BR>
mp3s, and cut them to CD; I also listened to the full quality recordings on
<BR>
that computer. I will try to cover my butt ethically, by also reporting that
<BR>
I did indeed buy the double-cd set (eventually). Yes, I am a sad little
<BR>
Metallica fan if you hadn't noticed. Their stuff sits in my CD collection
<BR>
between my Slayer CDs and my opera CDs.
<BR>
<P>What it comes down to is, the information has to be unencrypted to actually
<BR>
use it; that's a very good opportunity to steal it.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, no. If the file is encrypted such that each successive play

requires a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; new key to decrypt, which must be downloaded from the recording
</EM><BR>
company's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keyserver on a pay per play basis (i.e. no key can be used twice on the
</EM><BR>
same
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; downloaded file), then you have a very secure file format.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But not completely secure.  Make a backup of the file (and any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; associated data, like hidden files or Windows registry keys) before you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; play it, download the key to another file, trick the player into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;downloading&quot; the key from the file rather than the company, then copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the backup over the original, and there's your crack.  (If the key
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depends on the time as reported by the local computer, then trick the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; player into thinking it's always the same moment.  If the key depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the time as reported by the company's server, that can be specified as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of the served key; it's no problem if the local computer and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company's server have way out of sync clocks).
