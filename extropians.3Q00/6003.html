Eliezer S. Yudkowsky writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...Even if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superintelligence needs multiple components due to lightspeed limitations, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result isn't a society, it's a multicellular organism.  (But without the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibility of cancer.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Superorganisms and superintelligences can't have cancer? Why not? You've thrown
<BR>
down the gauntlet, and given rebels everywhere encouragement to invade the evil
<BR>
empire of multicellular SI.
<BR>
<P>Why would AI want to be friendly? Because if it represses its anger, and feels
<BR>
hostile, that could precipitate a carcinogenic cascade that hastens its death.
<BR>
Friendly entities experience lower incidence of cancer, according to statistical
<BR>
research.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perfectly reliable error-checking doesn't look difficult, if you're (a)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superintelligent and (b) willing to expend the computing power.  And imperfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error-checking (or divergent world-models) aren't a disaster, or even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; departure from the multicellular metaphor, as long as you anticipate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibility of conflicts in advance and design a resolution mechanism for any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflicts in the third decimal place that do show up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, you've done it again. If you're superintelligent... but you aren't, so, you
<BR>
can't know how difficult reliable error-checking looks to a superintelligence.
<BR>
For all we know, superintelligence may use errors to advance into domains and
<BR>
niches of hyperspace to fold proteins into mutant life forms that compute how to
<BR>
assimilate the atoms of Yudkowski into the essence of friendliness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...I stand by my statement.
</EM><BR>
<P>...but would a transhuman AI stand by your statement?
<BR>

<P><P><P>&quot;Smoking kills. If you're killed, you've lost a very important
<BR>
part of your life.&quot;
