<P><EM>&gt; Yes, psychology would have gotten a lot farther if the mind could be

<P>It cant be *now*.  End of story *now*.  Eliezer, remember that riff
<BR>
you wrote about a year or two ago about bringing on the singularity
<BR>
before our grandparents perish, etc.  That was upbeat, progressive,
<BR>
man it was inspiring!  Nowthen, lets see some of that good old
<BR>
dynamic optimism, bud!  Stand tall, we can do this, we can, for
<BR>
we are extropians.
<BR>
<P>In fact the first baby steps have already been taken.  When one
<BR>
is in the hospital one can have electrodes taped to one's head, and
<BR>
the info passed into a computer where some [admittedly very limited]
<BR>
insights can be obtained.  CAT scans can kinda derive info about
<BR>
what is going on in ones head.  We have sniffer chips that can
<BR>
determine, at least qualitatively, what chemicals we exude.  And
<BR>
this is ancient old y2k.  What is coming?
<BR>
<P>Its all an instrumentation problem.  Those electrodes I mentioned
<BR>
can get smaller and the data can be collected continuously and
<BR>
reduced in ways we cannot now do, to reveal insights we do not
<BR>
now have.  We will get new instruments that will ride inside the
<BR>
brain, and will measure and analyze the hormones, blood chemistry,
<BR>
etc.  It may take a few years or decades, but we will get there.
<BR>
<P>Granted the equations will not be neat and little, like physics
<BR>
equations, in fact they will not even be workable without massive
<BR>
computers.  We wont find anything analogous to E=mc^2.
<BR>
<P>My contention is that psychology will not move forward without
<BR>
these instruments and techniques.  spike
