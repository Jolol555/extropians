<P>Some of the sickest things I've said:
<BR>
<P>A month after my dad died unexpectedly, I went to a barbecue with my
<BR>
skydiving buddies, and one woman had the first steak placed on the
<BR>
grill- but it was also the last one off.  I gazed at the smoking charred
<BR>
lump of leather on her plate and blurted, &quot;Wow, they did that to my dad,
<BR>
too.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My buddy Dave the Graverobber (retired archeologist) called me for a
<BR>
morale booster the day he started radiation treatment for cancer, and I
<BR>
asked him, &quot;Irradiation, Dave? Don't they use that on fruits and
<BR>
vegetables?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Even sicker than than that, he instantly fired back, &quot;And on nuts too!&quot;,
<BR>
leaving me laughing hysterically since it was of course *prostate*
<BR>
cancer he was fighting...
<BR>
<P>Mark Twain said it best:  &quot;The secret source of Humor itself is not joy
<BR>
but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven.&quot;
