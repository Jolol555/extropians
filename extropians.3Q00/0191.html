<EM>&gt;&gt; I am playing devil's advocate here... why aren't all you non-US folk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; moving here?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I wonder what Amara will make of this.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know where to begin. I have written many pages of notes of
<BR>
my observations of (my) German life compared to (my) U.S. life. And
<BR>
I've just sampled one particular small region in Germany that may
<BR>
not be typical for Germany.
<BR>
<P>There are things that I miss about the U.S. every day. There are
<BR>
things about Germany that I will dearly miss whenever I move away
<BR>
from here.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Most interesting people?  I haven't heard that before.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nor I.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Possible reasons for not moving:
</EM><BR>
<P>My advisor is the best in the world in his field. And he's in
<BR>
Germany.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Preferring to live in dense pedestrian-oriented cities,
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I live in a tiny village in the middle of a thick forest
<BR>
(Odenwald). It's country life.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Not wishing to partake in a culture dependent upon cars
</EM><BR>
<P>This particular culture (German) _is_ in love with their cars.
<BR>
<P>Probably if I had the money (not possible on my PhD stipend), I
<BR>
_would_ own a car because I like very much the independence. And I
<BR>
owned and drove a car for 20 years before my move, so it's still a
<BR>
bit strange for me not having one.
<BR>
<P>However, trains, buses, my bike, and hitchhiking do pretty well to
<BR>
get me around, and in surprisingly good ways. I can't imagine doing
<BR>
what I'm doing now, car-less, living in the States.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Dependency on a culture with a much higher baseline concern for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quality of food.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, no question.
<BR>
<P>The people here give a lot of attention to their food. Very high
<BR>
quality. Very delicious.
<BR>
<P>I was thinking along these lines to answer Natasha last weekend for
<BR>
better more healthy food/nutrition for life extension.
<BR>
<P>If you want to try an experiment for eating more healthily, then put
<BR>
aside your car and your supermarket for a while. Then everything you
<BR>
put in your backpack or bicycle pack is something that you _really_
<BR>
want and have given some thought to.
<BR>
<P>A common Saturday shopping where I live, in order to buy food for
<BR>
the next week (before the stores close for the rest of the weekend
<BR>
at about 2pm) is to go to the bakery, the fruit/vegetable market,
<BR>
the butcher, and a small market that will have milk, cheese, other
<BR>
food products. Each has high quality food. You make at least several
<BR>
stops on your bicycle, filling up your packs. About 30% of the
<BR>
people in the town do what I do with their bikes, with the others in
<BR>
their cars. And yes, there are two small supermarkets in town, that
<BR>
do have customers (younger folks and families), but I seem to have
<BR>
fallen into the older style of way of living.
<BR>
<P>When I first moved here, and observed this food-buying tradition, I
<BR>
thought, &quot;gad, how inefficient!&quot;. But the quality is great, and I
<BR>
don't mind the inefficiency now.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A feeling that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Europeans are better educated and more interesting,
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. With no offense meant to the Americans, but most of the
<BR>
non-Americans, whom I've become good friends with during the last
<BR>
years, are more roundly-educated: they know a great deal about art,
<BR>
literature, history, music, other humanities and I really enjoy
<BR>
talking to them. I'm a &quot;generalist&quot;, myself, and like (and need) to
<BR>
be challenged in a range of different areas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;or that it's easier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;find those who are, in coffeehouses and such.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahh.. please indulge me while I give a discourse on the outside
<BR>
cafes. It's summertime, after all, and the outside cafes are full.
<BR>
<P>There is a Van Gogh painting about a cafe at night, called
<BR>
appropriately: &quot;Night Cafe&quot;,  that paints the mood of many of the
<BR>
European cities' old towns that I've seen, and Heidelberg in
<BR>
particular. In the painting, the tables are empty, but it shows a
<BR>
deep blue sky with a cobblestone street, some stars. It's a charming
<BR>
picture.
<BR>
<P>Now adding to the rest of the elements of the scene: the tables
<BR>
outside are full of people of all ages, drinking and eating and
<BR>
talking to each other. The sounds were friendly -- low tones from
<BR>
hundreds of people talking and laughing (and singing.. some street
<BR>
performers are performing in old town too). The castle that
<BR>
overlooks the old town is lit at night with soft yellow lights, and
<BR>
the old castle stone looks like it is glowing. Other blue and green
<BR>
and red lights from the businesses are reflected on the water of the
<BR>
Neckar river. All visible from sitting at the cafe tables.
<BR>
<P>It's very special to be in that environment: thoroughly enjoying the
<BR>
company of your friends, history all around, beautiful scenery, very
<BR>
friendly mood. I think you have to experience it, to understand it.
<BR>
<P>Now I will add a little more to your list, of nice things here.
<BR>
<P>Nature and Nature walks (of the Odenwald region).
<BR>
<P>Towns and forests sort of blend together. In other words, if I'm
<BR>
travelling through the forest near the edge of a village, there is
<BR>
not a sharp cut-off. First, the road is better groomed/paved, then I
<BR>
will see a house here and there, then more of them, and then I find
<BR>
myself in a village. Trails and tiny roads exist all through the
<BR>
area, sometimes marked, sometimes not marked. But it's difficult to
<BR>
get lost because if you look to the distance and know what direction
<BR>
to go, then eventually you'll hit a trail. And another. And another.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Spaziergang&quot; is the German word for &quot;pleasure walk&quot;, although that
<BR>
is probably not a good translation. This kind of walk, by many
<BR>
people of all ages where I live, is when one goes outside with one's
<BR>
friends, or one's companion or one's dog, or by yourself with your
<BR>
walking stick, and you enjoy walking, and the company of the those
<BR>
with you and the company of the outdoor scenes. I've seen very old
<BR>
people, I've seen little kids doing this. On Sunday, when everything
<BR>
is closed except for the restaurants, one sees even more of this
<BR>
activity. I've never lived in a society before where there was so
<BR>
much pleasure from this simple activity.
<BR>
<P>One more thing that I appreciate is that most of these people have
<BR>
real lives that don't revolve around their jobs. Their personal life
<BR>
always takes precedence, and they take great care to have their
<BR>
non-working life have a high quality.  I really appreciate that
<BR>
care. That attitude is definitely different than the Silicon Valley.
<BR>
<P>Ok, I've probably rambled, so stopping here.
