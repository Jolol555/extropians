<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have found a drug that increases the normal lifespan of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nematode worm, paving the way for a drug to stop ageing.  A
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;study in this week's journal Science by researchers at the Buck
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institute found that worms treated with a drug that mimics natural
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;antioxidant systems lived around 50% longer than untreated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nematodes.  &quot;Further studies on higher organisms in the near future
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will allow us to answer whether or not we have to reconsider aging
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an inevitability,&quot; says lead author Dr Simon Melov.  The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anti-ageing drug developed by the researchers is made up of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synthetic versions of superoxide dismutase and catalase, two
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enzymes involved in converting cell-damaging free radicals into
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water.  The researchers were also able to normalise lifespan in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutant nematode strain with a shortened life span linked to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidative stress.  It appears that oxidative stress is a major
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determinant of life span and that it can be counteracted by
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pharmacological intervention, they say, adding their next priority
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is to move these compounds towards clinical trials.  &quot;It has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already been shown that fruit fly and nematodes can be genetically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineered to live longer by increasing the number of genes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible for these enzymes,&quot; comments University of Queensland
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biochemist, Dr Paul Ebert. &quot;But the idea that a pill could have the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same effect is new&quot;.  Nematodes have been used for many years to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;study biological processes relevant to other species including
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humans.  &quot;We're not much different from nematodes,&quot; says Dr
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ebert.&quot;At a certain age, our mitochondria screw up and free
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radicals increase&quot;, although he adds there has been some debate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about whether free radicals are the major determinant of ageing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ebert's work includes studying insects which have grown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resistant to the ageing process by repeated exposure to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pesticide phosphine which kills insects by causing them to undergo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a rapid ageing process.  Asked about possible negative impacts of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drugs that mimic antioxidants, Dr Ebert said that other parts of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the body, for example, the immune system, used free radicals to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fight diseases. While the Science study ruled out negative impacts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of prolonged life on fertility or growth rate, there was no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apparent investigation of immune system effects.  The Buck
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Institute is co-operating with Eukarion Inc., a private
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biopharmaceutical company located in Massachusettes which holds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five US patents for technology of this kind and has been awarded
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over $2 million in grants from the US National Institutes of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health.
