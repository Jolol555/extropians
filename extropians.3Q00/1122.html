<P>Mr McMoneagle's somewhat rambling response does at least *begin* to address
<BR>
the question of how his RV results were assessed and evaluated for
<BR>
significance. 
<BR>
<P>The elements of his responses, he tells us, were compared by judges to the
<BR>
elements of a target, and recorded as hit or miss. (The determination of
<BR>
what is taken to be an element looks somewhat subjective, it's true, but
<BR>
since the judges are blind to the target this will hinder as often as it
<BR>
helps; moreover, I suspect the intel-style protocol declares assessable
<BR>
binary elements in advance.) Targets were usually drawn from a prepared set
<BR>
of alternatives, or `target pool', and were completely unrestricted in
<BR>
subject matter. This was done under lab conditions to prevent cueing or
<BR>
sensory leakage.
<BR>
<P>To test how surprising McMoneagle's results were (a grossly informal test
<BR>
but arguably not without merit), one might make copies of the set of
<BR>
targets posted on his site and arrange some blind judging/matching of his
<BR>
posted RV reports. How ambiguous are the drawings/descriptions? How many of
<BR>
the targets might be matched to any given report?
