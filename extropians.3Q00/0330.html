&quot;Thirty Proofs of God's Existence.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Some of my favorites:
<BR>
<P>1. We can never really prove or disprove the existence of God.
<BR>
Therefore, God exists. 
<BR>
<P>8. Even though I know very little about Nature, I feel certain that it
<BR>
could not have, by itself, produced things like consciousness, sunsets
<BR>
and birds. Therefore, God exists.
<BR>
<P>10. The light in a child's eyes has to come from somewhere and it
<BR>
couldn't possibly be that dull, grey mass called the brain. Therefore,
<BR>
God exists.
<BR>
<P>12. The Bible says that God exists and it would never lie. Therefore,
<BR>
God exists.
<BR>
<P>16. There have been many who have martyred themselves in the service of
<BR>
God. Look at the early Christians in Rome! It is simply inconceivable
<BR>
that they would have sacrificed themselves like this had God not
<BR>
actually existed. Therefore, God exists.
<BR>
<P>17. I am a person and therefore important. Therefore, God really does
<BR>
exist!
<BR>
<P>18. When I kneel down and pray for God's forgiveness, I feel uplifted,
<BR>
as if touched by a higher power. Therefore, God exists.
<BR>
<P>20. Since becoming a Christian, I have given up my drinking and whoring,
<BR>
and have become a better person who cares for others. I am currently at
<BR>
peace with the world. How can you account for this other than the fact
<BR>
that God exists?
<BR>
<P>21. When I entered the Christian community, I felt for the first time I
<BR>
truly belonged. Here at last was my true family, a family I have never
<BR>
known. Therefore, you can have my word on it, God most certainly does
<BR>
exist.
<BR>
<P>24.When I prayed to God, He cured my mother's cancer. Therefore, how can
<BR>
you say that God doesn't exist?  [Note:  This one would be pretty good
<BR>
if it were experimentally repeatable.]
<BR>
<P>26. Unfortunately, we are only human. We cannot become perfect, as Jesus
<BR>
urged us to do. Therefore, God exists in order to console us.
<BR>
<P>28. I don't want to know anything. I just want everything to be a great
<BR>
mystery, like in childhood. I just want to bury my head in God's
<BR>
shoulders and cry. Therefore, God exists.
<BR>
<P>30. Although my head tells me that God is a ludicrous concept, my heart
<BR>
cries out for His existence. Indeed, the fact that I see God as being
<BR>
ludicrous is precisely a test of my faith. The more ludicrous God
<BR>
appears to me, the stronger is my faith in believing in Him. Therefore,
<BR>
after examining the matter from all angles, I can only conclude that God
<BR>
exists.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I die adoring God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and
<BR>
detesting superstition.&quot;
