<P>
How to bring up this point?  I know I'm not the only one to wonder this, but
<BR>
here goes...
<BR>
<P>Is the core idea of Extropy (as I understand it, summarized by &quot;Upward and
<BR>
Outward&quot;) predicated on a libertarian philosophy?  Does one have to accept
<BR>
all the other excess baggage that comes with libertarianism (i.e. absolute
<BR>
freedom to own and use firearms, no centralized legal systems, decentralized
<BR>
or no environmental regulations, no public investment from non-private 
<BR>
organizations, etc.) to be a true extropian?
<BR>
<P>I ask this question as a believer in the concepts of expanding beyond what
<BR>
are accepted as &quot;common&quot; limitations - overcoming such barriers as aging
<BR>
pathologies and death, limitations of the physical body (strength, endurance,
<BR>
etc.), limitations of input bandwidth and storage, gravity wells, the speed of
<BR>
light...  All of these things that we can and SHOULD overcome.
<BR>
<P>I do not, and cannot, accept the fundamental assumptions that seem to underly
<BR>
libertarianism - the axioms, often implicit, are ones I cannot accept, just
<BR>
as I cannot accept the axioms that underly Christianity or Scientology.  I 
<BR>
can accept an dsympathize with many of the ideas underlying the political
<BR>
philosophy, and am at least friendly to most.  My issues are those of 
<BR>
implementation - the practical questions that need to be answered before a 
<BR>
political philosophy becomes a political system.  That having been said,
<BR>
I need to ask this in plain language:
<BR>
<P>Is everyone out there on this list a libertarian, or is that just the air this
<BR>
list puts forward?  Because if that's the cost of entry...  I don't know if I
<BR>
can continue to provide constructive input into a discussion where I don't
<BR>
buy into the same basic assumptions.
<BR>
