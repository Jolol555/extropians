<EM>&gt; &gt; Kind of reminds me of a truck I saw in the US with two stickers on it. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  first one said &quot;member of the NRA&quot;, the second said &quot;support Clinton/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Gore&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Unfortunately it could also be an illustration of the same 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  errors that some transhumans commit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I like that guy!! That's NOT neccesarily  an error, it simply is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contradictory. He absolutely correct in his own convictions. Perhaps he is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;avidly against religion in the school -  but  likes the economy since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;democrats are in power -  and maybe he even supports socialized medicine -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;while still being a staunch believer in right to bear arms! Hey, maybe he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my uncle... an American Indian, he wants to keep his land rights AND his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guns!
</EM><BR>
<P>It was not about American politics at all. Instead it was a much deeper 
<BR>
discussion to which the sticker example was a quite small illustration.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;         &quot;The capacity to tolerate complexity and welcome contradiction, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the need for simplicity and certainty, is the attribute of an explorer&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;             --Heinz R. Pagels, Perfect Symmetry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Personally, I applaud people who have their OWN opinions on individual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, is it OK to say that nanotechnology should allowed but computers are 
<BR>
evil and must be banned? Isn't that weaking your own philosophical basis? 
<BR>
You have admitted to different principles, and soon you will get into 
<BR>
conflict.
<BR>
<P>Well, this discussion isn't what I had in mind but your mail inspired me, 
<BR>
so...
<BR>
<P>Having the &quot;individual opinions&quot; is very common for people that haven't 
<BR>
really thought their opinions through. And really why should they? Politics 
<BR>
(one of the few areas they remotedly most are in contact with) is today a 
<BR>
smorgasboard where politicians offer goodies if you vote for them &quot;vote for 
<BR>
me I will double your welfare check while reducing your taxes&quot;.
<BR>
<P>But transhumanism isn't a smorgasboard. If your starting to introduce 
<BR>
inconsitencies it will very quickly be weakened by the conflicts so 
<BR>
introduced.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;IT is perfectly OK to blatantly disagree with your party's platforms on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issues. I think it more productive, since the party will listen more to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own -- than to a bunch of non-thinking party liners who are destructive.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was not talking about party politics, that is a different case, that 
<BR>
requires a deeper analysis. I was talking about how philosophical principles 
<BR>
are strong or weak.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Most of the Bush supporters also think prayer in the schools should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;restored too, Will you accuse someone of the same crap if they had a Bush
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sticker and an atheist one?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Surely you must.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;LONG LIVE THE OPEN DYNAMIST SOCIETY!&quot;
<BR>
beneath the sticker:
<BR>
&quot;BILL JOY FOR PRESIDENT&quot;
<BR>
<P>Do you notice the inconcistency?
<BR>
The man with the truck (to use that example again, with its fallancies) 
<BR>
didn't really see that his vote for those politicians was against what he 
<BR>
advocated in his first sticker. That's the problem with the smorgasboard 
<BR>
approach, you will get inconsistencies, and you're either forced to drop 
<BR>
your views in the long run, or to change your views.
<BR>
<P>The question is really about philosophical principles, can one advocate 
<BR>
transhumanism while sharing stasist views upon society? I think it will be 
<BR>
really hard, since you often find yourself in the dilemma of being either 
<BR>
impractical or immoral. Those discrepances are dangerous.
