<P>Pretty nifty.
<BR>
<P>Around the same time, I dramatized this general idea in THE WHITE ABACUS:
<BR>
<P>==============
<BR>
A more burly fellow wandered by, just visible within the display.  Despite
<BR>
the day's brightness and evident heat, he was lavishly clad, from his
<BR>
broad, heavy shoes to his bulky sleeveless gown, furred in ermine.  I
<BR>
regarded him with some envy, conscious of my own nakedness.  Under the gown
<BR>
he wore waistcoat, jerkin, doublet opened at the bulging codpiece. His
<BR>
massive arms, swinging, moved easily in sleeves slashed and puffed.  It was
<BR>
a formidable display.  Fashion glosses flickered: Hans Holbein the Younger,
<BR>
Henry VIII, items of garb orbiting an historic attractor in couture
<BR>
data-space.  The boy's gaze was fixed upon the spectacle, though not, I
<BR>
began to realise, with admiration.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Are you all deaf?' he shouted peevishly.  `My luggage!'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burly fellow frowned once.  Striding past without moderating his pace,
<BR>
he smiled through his square red-brown beard at the boy, nodded, glanced at
<BR>
the luggage, quirked his lips in approval at the fine bags, sent the boy a
<BR>
companionable wink, strolled on.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recorded data stream lost a little crispness as the display widened to
<BR>
keep them both in register.  The boy was plainly agog at the burly man's
<BR>
insolent disregard.  I watched his fists clench, then tremblingly come
<BR>
under control.  He called more loudly. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Citizen!  The red singlet!'  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the man paused in surprise, turned, touched his hat, brought it
<BR>
closer to his right ear.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Morning, petal.'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an instant I, too, was confused.  It seemed the fellow wore almost
<BR>
every garment ever devised for a 16th century European gentleman, one on
<BR>
top of the other, with the exception of a singlet.  I understood, then,
<BR>
with something of a shock, that the boy was somehow operating without
<BR>
Gestell access.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tsin said at the same moment, `You'll notice, Sen, that the young man is
<BR>
in vanilla mode.  No aks.'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy stood poised on the balls of his feet, beside his luggage,
<BR>
shivering with controlled fury.  His voice rose in pitch.  `I have just
<BR>
disembarked from orbit.  Due to some extraordinary oversight I have not
<BR>
been met.'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That was you in the flying brick, was it?'  The burly citizen was polite.
<BR>
&nbsp;`Why don't you aks for help?'  I plunged into the substrate tuple field,
<BR>
fetched out his un-augmented appearance.  He was indeed wearing a shabby
<BR>
red singlet stained under the armpits in sweat, sloppy shorts of an
<BR>
execrable tartan, and a pair of heavy walking boots.  I let his eidolon
<BR>
covered him again decently.
<BR>
<P>=============================
<BR>
<P>The notion was also described in Samuel R. Delany's astonishing novel STARS
<BR>
IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND, back in 1984.
