<P>
<EM>&gt;   I am not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; using this as a reason to treat patterns in a specific way, only to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; explain why we should not automatically assume that methods we have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; used to treat matter shouldn't automatically be applied to patterns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You say there's a difference, but you're not using that difference as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason to treat patterns in a specific way.  If that is true, then please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stop doing it.   Since the nature of our conversation is how we're going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treat patterns versus atoms, then you can see why by your own words this so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called 'difference' is irrelevant to the conversation we're having.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you want to use the 'difference' in your arguments, which it is clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you do, then you need to find justification for why that difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should cause us to treat patterns in a specific way.  Please stop giving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with one hand and taking away with the other.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are both playing the rhetorical game of trying to put the burden of proof
<BR>
on the other.
<BR>
<P>Each one agrees that information goods have differences from material
<BR>
goods, in that they can be reproduced cheaply, practically for free.
<BR>
And each agrees that there are similarities, in that they can be expensive
<BR>
to produce.
<BR>
<P>Each one then challenges the other to explain why the conventions used
<BR>
for material goods should or should not apply to information goods.
<BR>
<P>I suggest that you each take on the burden of proof to make your own
<BR>
point, instead of pretending that a failure on the other's part is a
<BR>
victory for you.
<BR>
<P>If you believe that the differences between information and physical
<BR>
goods justify treating them differently, then make an argument for it.
<BR>
If you believe that the differences don't justify such differential
<BR>
treatment, then make the argument for why the differences are irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>Don't try so hard to make the other guy look bad, worry more about making
<BR>
your own case strong.
<BR>
<P>Hal
