<P><EM>&gt; It sounds really cool; similiar to Utopia. Looks like they stole a time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine, came forward and saw Utopia, then went back in time and made their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own copy. Or else Utopia is a rippoff.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect that Utopia is a son-of-son-of-son-of-Empire.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I didn't see anything about the usual number of players per game. This power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of having so many players was the gist of my previous posts.
</EM><BR>
<P>It depends on the size of the world created.  In the early days it would
<BR>
usually be support 16 or 32 people (computers were small back then...).
<BR>
<P>But there were no real barriers to creating a very big world that
<BR>
could support a lot of players.  For the game to be interesting
<BR>
you have to have space/player work out to something like 64-256
<BR>
sectors/player.  That gave you room to grow and sectors to specialize
<BR>
before you &quot;bumped&quot; into your neighbors (most of the time).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Utopia is not a great game. It's fairly mediocre in my reckoning; it's full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of clunky fixes to try to retain game balance, each such resulting in rule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes so that each round, the rules have been changed to stop an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unbalanced tactic from the round before, and which invariably introduce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their own new problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Empire went through the same process as people discovered loopholes
<BR>
and they were blocked which then made more complex loopholes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But it is 60,000 players, and an entirely simplistic abstract geographical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; model (if you want to think in terms of a map, it is as if you were adjacent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to every other player), that makes the game incredible. It is just soooo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many people; such a game is qualitatively different from any small scale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game. Strategies that work for 2 adjacent opponents, or 4, or 20, do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work for 60,000; new strategies emerge which are innapropriate in games with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller numbers of players.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are adjacent to every other player, then it is N-dimensional
<BR>
(which is an interesting concept).  Empire was entirely reality based
<BR>
(2-dimensional), which made the formation and keeping of treaties an
<BR>
interesting exercise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I loved this quote from the Empire description:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;To prevent the more fanatical Empire players from staying logged on all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time, Empire places a limit on the amount of time you may be logged in per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day. This limit is settable by the deity, usually 1000 minutes. If you run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of time, too bad! You can't log in again until the counter resets itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (usually at midnight). &quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is probably a post-original-empire version variant.  In the original
<BR>
version, you had no login/command limitations (that became unfair to the
<BR>
players who had &quot;real&quot; jobs or studies).  Then it was switched to
<BR>
administrative &quot;directive&quot; limits (the president/king only has &quot;so much&quot;
<BR>
time to give orders).   Then that was balanced, I think, by the ability
<BR>
to dedicate some of your population/capital to &quot;administrative&quot; centers
<BR>
to allow semi-automated management (with an associated cost).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you use 1000 minutes in a day, you are in serious, serious, serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble!!! I don't think I've racked up that much time on Utopia in a day -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too often.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am sure that there were a few Empire players in the early days who
<BR>
may have managed to do this.  Ultimately it got constrained so the
<BR>
most you could spend on it was about 2 hours per day (online).
