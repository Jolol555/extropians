<P>
I question the relevancy that one's views about the death penalty have to 
<BR>
one's views on self-defense.  The law recognizes the right to use lethal 
<BR>
force to prevent not just murder but a much wider range of crimes that cause 
<BR>
severe bodily harm.  Set aside the moral justifications (which I think quite 
<BR>
sound) for that principle; epistemic problems alone counsel it's adoption.  
<BR>
We cannot know which vicious attacks will result in murder, nor which 
<BR>
forceful defenses will cause death.  The law quite reasonably errs on the 
<BR>
side of the preventing harm to innocents.
<BR>
<P>The death penalty poses quite a different epistemic problem, given that the 
<BR>
legal system has a great many checks to provide that only the gulity get 
<BR>
killed.  Granted, the legal system sometimes errs in such cases--that, 
<BR>
however, is not the question.  The question is whether victims' faced with 
<BR>
potential death and using uncertain tools raise different problems from legal 
<BR>
systems grinding through murder cases.  The answer: Yes, very.

<P><EM>&gt;I am curious, do people who advocate using guns against robbers also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;support the death penalty?  And would they support expanding the range
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of crimes which deserve death, since they are personally willing to kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in response to sub-lethal crimes?  Would they even go to the point that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they would support the death penalty for robbery?
