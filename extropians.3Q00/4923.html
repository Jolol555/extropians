<EM>&gt; Well, I don't think you do it with rational arguments and science. Probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you need to use a purpose built dogmatic doctrine, designed to basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep these people feel calm and comfortable. A purpose built religion would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do a good job, although we are not really in the business of religion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Better to create a startup venture, new economy style, by partnering with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; established religion; maybe one of the older versions of Xtianity which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering declining numbers. We could work with some mainstream religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scholars to put a high-tech twist on Jesus' better stuff, and turn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; armageddon into a singularity in messianic clothing. It could possibly go a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long way, and I bet you'd get some funding (corporate?) to help build such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an institution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly hear that.  This is something I've thought about more than a
<BR>
little myself.  If you could take that religious bent in human beings
<BR>
and that need for answers and turn it to science and technology you
<BR>
might have a cultural force that would more than counter-balance the
<BR>
Neo-Luddites.  After all science and technology can actually deliver on
<BR>
most of the promises that religion has made such as immortality, perfect
<BR>
health, healing of all ailments, esoterica like creating things just by
<BR>
thinking, flying through the air apparently unaided, practical telepathy
<BR>
and on and on.  Why buy into sloppy promises of such things when you can
<BR>
have and even help create the actuality?  Why not a religous movement
<BR>
with churches that preach the freedom to recreate the world based on
<BR>
science/technology and the abundance that could be ours?  Hell, collect
<BR>
offerings and use them to fund high-tech R&amp;D and startups.  Holy venture
<BR>
capital!  I even fantasized a name for that movement - &quot;The Church of
<BR>
the Holy Nanite&quot;.  :-)
<BR>
<P>The utility of this thing doesn't end with those not reachable by
<BR>
reason.  It could also be a place to weave visions of what kind of world
<BR>
we want to build as we gather more and more means to shape the world to
<BR>
our own wishes.  It could be even a place for weaving new ethics and
<BR>
vision that unifies not just the unwashed and semi-literate but the very
<BR>
people who are building the future.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or else we could just bolster the general morass of PR/marketing/advertising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telling everyone that it's all OK, just buy stuff and be happy, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone's rich (even the people who aren't). The best bet is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pacify/neutralise those who would otherwise oppose, and work on gaining the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support of the people who are likely to be helpful. There's a big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarian sentiment &amp; technophilic sentiment on the net; possibly that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be manipulated into a huge extro sentiment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if we are going to do the &quot;everyone's rich&quot; thing we need some way
<BR>
for people to get a piece of the pie and some modicum of respect with it
<BR>
even if they don't have a fulltime job.  Fulltime jobs are likely to
<BR>
become more and more scarce for mere mortals.  Some folks would be much
<BR>
more in favor of the Singularity and stuff leading up to it if they were
<BR>
less anxious about being able to continue having the means to take care
<BR>
of themselves and their family along the way.  
<BR>
<P>As an aside, you might be able to buy off a lot of people with
<BR>
super-touchy-feelie VR where they could do what ever the hell they
<BR>
wanted to with no long term repurcussions.  That would go a long way in
<BR>
many people's book. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think the religion is a goer myself. All this marketting guff is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific enough; people want something solid to believe, something which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tells them what clothes to wear when they get out of bed in the morning, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best way to brush their teeth, what side of the street to walk on. A manual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the right way to live your life. It's doable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Emlyn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I hate myself. Aargh. But this is, like, a joke, you know?)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Is it?  Much wierder things have been done and have worked throughout
<BR>
history.  You could do a religion modality based on science and
<BR>
technology.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  It would also serve
<BR>
to unify to powerful forces in human society and perhaps get them to
<BR>
pull together for once.
