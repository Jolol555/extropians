<P>Paul, you may want to go through the last year or so of the Extropy Inst.
<BR>
archives for my notes on nanotech development.  I've commented fairly
<BR>
extensively that assemblers are so small, that shortly after they are
<BR>
developed there will be many teams working developing their own (around or
<BR>
through the existing patent laws).
<BR>
<P>An &quot;interesting&quot; loophole in the patent laws, at least in the U.S., allows
<BR>
you to infringe on patents so long as what you are developing is going
<BR>
to eventually require FDA approval.  So probably much of what is in
<BR>
Nanomedicine could be developed by people using home-built assemblers
<BR>
even if they do infringe on any patents.
<BR>
<P>Assemblers are small and they don't generally require exotic materials
<BR>
(e.g. plutonium) to build them.  Every current AFM manufacturer,
<BR>
disk drive manufacturer, semiconductor or MEMS fab will have large
<BR>
chunks of the technology base required to develop assemblers.
<BR>
The scarce resource will not be money (because the VC's will be
<BR>
throwing money at assembler companies), the scarce resource will
<BR>
be mechanical/chemical engineers that &quot;think&quot; nano.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Basically the first company to develop the assembler, lets say Zyvex,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has the potential to completely dominate the economy from that point forward.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That being the case, Zyvex would quickly become the worlds first trillion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollar company, and thats not counting its holdings on Wall Street!
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so.  You could ask Robin what fraction of the economy is actually
<BR>
manufacturing.  I don't think it is large.  Information (R&amp;D, news &amp;
<BR>
entertainment) is a huge fraction and assemblers don't touch that.
<BR>
Assemblers don't touch the agriculture, biotech or transporation industries
<BR>
until someone comes up with better (and cheaper) nanotech based designs.
<BR>
Nanoassembly is likely to cause significant growth in the software and
<BR>
mechanical &amp; chemical engineering sectors of the economy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since nanotech has the potential to bring prices of all material
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goods down to near-zero, that is exactly what will happen if enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competition exists.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not &quot;near zero&quot; -- approximately $1.00 per kg is the figure typically
<BR>
used.  There are already many things (food &amp; construction materials)
<BR>
that are around cost level.  Where the costs may differ is between &quot;public&quot;
<BR>
open source designs and speciality industry designs (that have associated
<BR>
royalties).  Nanotech designs will not fall out of the sky to create a
<BR>
nano-santa world - they are going to require a lot of work by a lot of people.
<BR>
Even when you can assemble trillions of atoms atomically, you *still*
<BR>
have to specify what those atoms are and where they should go.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Saige Responds:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...Thats what I fear the most... That either one company, or multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies, will develop this technology and abuse the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual property laws to keep it to themselves, and establish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty much control over things.
</EM><BR>
<P>Control may be required, but more as a safety measure than as a
<BR>
a result of IP laws.  You want a limited number of organizations
<BR>
to have general purpose assembler capability (opposed to say
<BR>
&quot;food&quot; replicator capability) so they can be carefully monitored
<BR>
by independent safety organizations to ensure they do not manufacture
<BR>
dangerous designs.
<BR>
<P>You would like the designs to be either open source or open review
<BR>
(for say patented designs) so a huge number of people can monitor
<BR>
them for safety.  Ultimately we can all have general purpose assemblers
<BR>
so long as they are secure and cannot be modified to construct non-approved
<BR>
designs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After all, wealth isn't really an objective thing, but a subjective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing. Being wealthy is determined by how much more you have than other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people. And while after developing this technology they may not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nearly as much need for money themselves, they still have the ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gain power by keeping it away from other people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Our current concepts of &quot;wealth&quot; get significantly shifted in a nanotech
<BR>
era.  I suspect some elements remain the same -- the people with enough
<BR>
money can pay for large nanotech design teams to create the nano
<BR>
versions of the Gates house or the Ellison sailboat.  The difference
<BR>
will be that a few tens of thousands of people will be able to pool their
<BR>
resources and do an open source design and &quot;grow&quot; their own house or
<BR>
sailboat (which takes a few years).  In contrast, right now, the designs
<BR>
for the house or sailboat would be worthless because we still couldn't
<BR>
afford to build it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;From a corporate view, it would actually be wrong to make this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology available to others.  A corporation is all about gaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealth and power, and that's exactly what the corporate ethics are. To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them, it would be unethical to make it available to others, because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would directly oppose their main goal of profit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  The last time I went to the stock market (as a buyer) or started
<BR>
a company (as an officer) it was all about &quot;return-on-investment&quot;.
<BR>
Corporations do not set out to gain &quot;wealth and power&quot;.  They are
<BR>
managed to provide decent returns to the investors or they don't
<BR>
last very long.
<BR>
<P>Any decent corporation will have a fairly sophisticated model about how
<BR>
to vary the price of its products to maximize return.  Typically that
<BR>
will be to charge a lot in the beginning to the deepest pockets and
<BR>
to charge less and less as the market saturates and demand falls.
<BR>
You will probably see the assembler companies drop their prices as
<BR>
fast as designs are developed which expand their markets.  If on
<BR>
the other hand you get the biggest boost by selling a billion
<BR>
nano-air-cars at $500 each (thats about a 100% markup), then that
<BR>
is the sales model you use.
<BR>
<P>Designs are going to be the constraint on nanotech development and
<BR>
availability -- not the assemblers.  Given the rapid pace of design
<BR>
enhancement, a &quot;used&quot; market is likely to develop quickly so you
<BR>
can expect to see the kind of pricing scales you typically see today.
<BR>
(&quot;Oh god, I bought this nano-air-car, three weeks ago and it is already
<BR>
obsolete, I'd better sell it now before it is completely worthless.&quot;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To be honest, I'd rather not have nanotechnology, then have it under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete control of a corporation or two, but be unavailable to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; except the goods produced by it. (And likely not the best ones possible,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so to guarantee people having to make repeat purchases.)
</EM><BR>
<P>You will be guaranteed to have to make repeat purchases (or grow new
<BR>
&quot;stuff&quot;) because designs will evolve and get better as people discover
<BR>
more clever ways to accomplish specific tasks.  The design space for
<BR>
nanotech is very large and the initial designs are going to look
<BR>
like real hacks after 10, 20, 30 years of nanodesign experience have
<BR>
accumulated.
<BR>
