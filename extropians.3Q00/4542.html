<EM> &gt; &gt; The extermination (or enslavement) of several billion people would surely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; require an expenditure of a considerable amount of time and energy - even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; for an SI.  What motivation could it have for doing so ?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Removal of a forest, to make place for fields, houses and parking lots
<BR>
requires an expenditure of a considerable amount of time and
<BR>
energy. Nevertheless, it is being done, because we people actually
<BR>
need the space. I would like to see for what kind of animals (apart
<BR>
from humans, their pets and parasites) can thrive in the parking lot
<BR>
habitat. Or inside of your house.
<BR>
<P>The new ecology occupies space and need energy. You're in the way, and 
<BR>
because the newcomers are so much fitter, you're dead meat.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Some of the scientists who build SIs may feel the project entails too much risk.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; In order to satisfy the expectations of such SI workers, the SI may kill
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; everyone... leaving the queasy SI workers for last.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The seed may be vulnerable, but not for long. Especially if it escapes
<BR>
into the global network. It will probably not even actively terminate,
<BR>
just expand. If you happen to be in the way (and you can't avoid being
<BR>
in the way, because the expansion is so fast), the atoms in your body
<BR>
will be recycled, and become part of the SI. No harsh feelings, I hope.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; It seems to me that most sapients consider diversity to be a very important
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; thing - why would a A/SI not think the same.  To keep humans around would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; require very little expense to the SI, while at the same time providing it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; with an enormous pool of intellectual diversity.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Becase the SI is not homogenous, but an ecology. Including species
<BR>
much dumber than humans. Dumb, but deadly.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; No, because the SI would find about as much stimulating diversity in human
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; relations as humans find in poetry written by monkeys.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It is a question of vastly differing fitness, and living in the same
<BR>
niche. Whether god, or god's lice, you're fair game. The god will not
<BR>
care and 3453adfb5345.345w453353 you, the lice will just eat you.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; The notion that an SI would just wake up and decide to wipe out humanity
</EM><BR>
<P>The thing does not wake up, it evolves from a seed. And it is not one,
<BR>
but many, and all of them very different. Some of them might even want
<BR>
to protect you against the others, though I can't imagine why.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; strikes me as absurd - to do so would require tremendous arrogance, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; would hope that something supposedly more intelligent than us would realise
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; how stupid it was being.
</EM><BR>
<P>Evolution is not arrogant, it is evolution. Do not anthromorphize.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; There's nothing inherently stupid about wiping out Homo sapiens sapiens
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (especially if your friends need the space).
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeedy.
