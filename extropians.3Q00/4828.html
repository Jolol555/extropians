<P><EM>&gt;My mother is color blind. From my own reading on the subject, somewhere around

<EM>&gt;95% of color blind people are male, AFAIKR

<P>8% of males are color-deficient in some respect; 0.5% of females are.  So your
<BR>
SWAG is pretty accurate.
<BR>
<P>A friend of mine (female) was studying to be an epidemiologist and had to switch 
<BR>
careers because there was a lot of staring at slides that had been stained to 
<BR>
delineate structure.  She is totally color-blind, and couldn't distinguish stain
<BR>
boundaries.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, I used to work with a red-green color-blind programmer who
<BR>
could reliably distinguish colors by saturation, rather than tint.

<P><EM>&gt;Since there are different forms of color blindness, I wonder what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;breakdown is.  But this was all caused by a parenthetic comment, so perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's best just to not added new branches to this thread.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't find where I put the exact breakdown of color-blindness forms.  When I
<BR>
find it, I'll email Daniel privately unless anyone else cares.  But the most
<BR>
common kind is red-green, followed by blue, followed by total.
<BR>
<P>Total color-blindness is very rare, but relatively frequent among Moroccan, 
<BR>
Iraqi, and Iranian Jews.  The highest incidence worldwide is in incestuous 
<BR>
families.  The dubious distinction of first place is a family residing on the 
<BR>
Island of Fuur in the north of Denmark.  
<BR>
<P>On the island of Pingelap, 12% of the population is totally color-blind.
<BR>
They make excellent night fishermen, but they are not considered suitable
<BR>
mates by non-achromats.  They can't read normal-sized print, or even 
<BR>
reliably pick berries.
<BR>
<P>Color-blindness is not always due to genetic factors; it can also be caused
<BR>
by injury or illness.
