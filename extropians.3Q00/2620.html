From: &quot;Alex Future Bokov&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20Ebola&In-Reply-To=&lt;003501c000bf$0f38ad20$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; We as a civilization are using centralized, hierarchical tools (laws,
</EM><BR>
threat
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of military force) to fight decentralized, distributed threats. The
</EM><BR>
question
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is, how can the system be rigged such that anybody working in their
</EM><BR>
basement
<BR>
<EM>&gt; can also help *prevent* biowarfare? A couple of possibilities immediately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spring to mind--

<P><EM>&gt;There is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corollary of the Law of Large Numbers called the &quot;Some Nut Theory&quot; which

state that &quot;In a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently large population, no matter what it is, there is some nut out
</EM><BR>
there who will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; try it.&quot;  Unfortunately, this implies that when the technological cost of
</EM><BR>
whacking your
<BR>
<EM>&gt; first megaperson gets down to $1.50 and two box tops, a fair number of us
</EM><BR>
are going to get
<BR>
<EM>&gt; whacked.

<P><P><P><P>Our individual power is increasingly at a rapid rate.  As already noted, it
<BR>
won't be long before it is trivial for any one individual to get a hold of
<BR>
the tools necessary to do lots of damage to lots and lots of other people.
<BR>
<P>I've thought about possible solutions, but they all point in relatively
<BR>
undesirable directions.
<BR>
<P>For instance, the only way I can imagine preventing certain types of
<BR>
mega-nano-crimes is to predict the intention.  But I don't really like the
<BR>
possible implications of this sort of mental 'eavesdropping.'
<BR>
<P>For those of you who've read 'The Diamond Age,' by Neal Stephenson you'll be
<BR>
familiar with the 'nano y nano' scenario.  Unfortunately it doesn't appear
<BR>
possible to create perfect 'anti-bodies' and it has always been easier to
<BR>
destroy something than to prevent against destruction.  It lies in the hands
<BR>
of the defender to predict against all possible attacker vectors, now and in
<BR>
the future, and I don't see how that will ever be possible.
<BR>
<P>Again, I believe the step towards increased security lies in 'getting ahead'
<BR>
of the act and intercepting the intention.  Since the advantage lies in the
<BR>
hands of the attacker, it should necessarily follow that when your brain is
<BR>
wired to the network, the tools to hack it will always be one step ahead of
<BR>
the tools to shield it.  (Barring unbreakable encryption-- of which I am an
<BR>
advocate.)
<BR>
<P>I think some variant on the 'active defense' is going to be necessary in any
<BR>
case.
