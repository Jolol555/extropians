</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, it's fairly clear that the loudest voices on this list are fairly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rightist, with a few leftist leaning individuals as well.  But the fact remains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there is still the kind of political fundamentalism that renders any sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of meaningful political discourse useless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, likening the right-wing death squads in Colombia to PPL/J was a little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disingenious - but I chose the references carefully.  Those squads represent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a group of people who feel that their own military is not doing enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protect them, and have instead pressed for a NGO to come in and take care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the peacekeeping that they so desperately want.  If there weren't those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that supported the role of these squads as upholding their particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;law and order&quot;, they wouldn't exist.  Most PPL/J scenarios I have read end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up eventually boiling down to some sort of coercive tactics, unless and until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you change the core of human nature.
</EM><BR>
<P>The question though, if you are going to maintain that the 'death squads' (they
<BR>
obviously don't call themselves that, its a moniker applied by leftist
<BR>
propagandists), especially considering the marxists have killed far more private
<BR>
citizens than the 'right wing death squads' have, yet I don't see the media
<BR>
complaining about 'left wing death squads', as if the people they kill deserve
<BR>
it....
<BR>
<P>If Columbia is in fact an example of a PPL\J system, it is one that is operating
<BR>
in a crisis situation as a result of a failure in government to provide law and
<BR>
justice services that were paid for. They are the volunteer firemen, the
<BR>
volunteer ambulance drivers. They didn't start the fire, but they are being
<BR>
blamed for it because they are on the scene when the TV cameras show up, and are
<BR>
being called 'vigilantes' by the arsonists and the arsonists sympathyzers, as
<BR>
well as by the city government that is bribed by arsonists and the city
<BR>
firemen's union that refuses to do its job. Excuse me while I puke.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is, however, aside from the point.  The old political spectrum, right vs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; left, is crumbling, at least in the US.  The arguements between right and left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are falling apart, and none too soon, I think.  Quite frankly, I'm glad the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Republicans managed to keep most of their bigots and small-minded people - it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a good counter to the race supremacists and radical feminists on the Democratic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side.  And it shows the Republican stance to be as morally bankrupt as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Democratic one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The ease with which leftist bigots and rightist bigots find alliances on
<BR>
specific issues does show your point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The issue hereis that political systems as we understand them do not scale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whatever your governmental system is, they do not scale well enough to our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current geopolitical reality.  This holds true for anarchism, libertarianism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascism, stalinism, socialism, communism, democracy, republic - the combination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of population and land area has outstripped the ability of our technology to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue.  Who herehonestly believes that any of our existing (or recently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existing) governments would be capable of administrating a thriving extra-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terrestrial colony?  The distances are too vast for our current technology to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;glue&quot; together.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, you mean act as an ET colonial power? Thats easy, it depends on FTL travel
<BR>
and communications. Empires become unweildy when it takes more than a few months
<BR>
to travel or communicate from the edge of the realm to the center. At our
<BR>
current level of technology, interplanetary empires are difficult, but not
<BR>
impossible. Interstellar ones are impossible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So all this talk about right vs. left, socialism vs. libertarianism, is simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rearranging the deck chairs.  Government does best what it is SIZED to do -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the federal governent f the US does not get in the business of marriage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; licenses, hunting licenses, traffic violations, etc. except in the grossest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible way, because it is not sized to deal with these issues.  Conversely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the failure of the Cofederacy involved the inability of the central government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the time to collect the taxes necssary for the meager few services it DID
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide (i.e. military and diplomatic roles).
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually most all military units in the CSA were state raised, trained, funded
<BR>
and operated units (as were many units on the union side). At the time, the
<BR>
federal government did not allow a large standing army for constitutional
<BR>
reasons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am going to commit what I have come to believe is a heresy amongst this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; group - I am an environmentalist. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Happy joy. So am I. Surprised?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not one of these luddite neolith
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophers who would give back fire if they could.  But quite honestly, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do NOT think that corporate or personal interest trumps all.  It's the Tragedy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the Commons - one company (DuPont) can go a little lax on safety mechanisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and kill tens of thousands of people (Bhopal, India, 1984) and those people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never had a chance to protect themselves. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Except they voted for the government that taxed capital investments by 50%, and
<BR>
which counted safety systems as capital investments....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I get headaches from being behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poorly tuned diesel vehicles - this is NOT healthy!  But there is nothing I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as one person can do without some sor tof advocacy group with enough teeth to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make sure that I can breathe clean air and drink clean water. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, write down the license plate number of the truck. Rear end it. Claim
<BR>
you were incapacitated by the exhaust fumes, sue and collect. Legal market
<BR>
pressures can do their jobs...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joining a group like the Sierra Club won't guarantee that - they have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enfrcement power.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, a large amount of the environmental and safety improvements of
<BR>
the last few decades are a direct result of class action lawsuits againt
<BR>
perpetrators of externalities like this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  My life is continually jeopardized, in small amounts, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peopel who operate vehicles without meeting smog regulations, who dump small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amounts of contaminants in aquefers, who spray known cancer-causing pesticides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on their crops because its cheap.  Free markets will never provide this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of environmental protection.  It is always a race to the bottom - because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even though _I_ may elect to buy organic produce, or produce grown without the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of DDT, the cheaper produce grabs the greatest market share.  If you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm lying, conside this:  Produce from Mexico can be grown using DDT, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imported into the US.  This produce, despite crossing national boundaries,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is about 5-10% cheaper than stuff grown here in CA.  Regardless of the health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risks, which produce sells better?  The cheaper stuff.
</EM><BR>
<P>Under GATT and NAFTA, there are provisions for this. Dolphin unsafe tuna from
<BR>
mexico is not sold here, and such restrictions survive challenges at the WTO.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Many things can be decided by the free market - I will not argue this.  But it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is NOT and should never be considered a panacea, let alone an infallible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deity.  Anythign in excess is a vice, including moderation. (pardon the poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paraphrase and lack of attribution - I don't have my Bartlett's handy)
</EM><BR>
<P>The market is completely dependent upon the initiative of its participants. If
<BR>
you are a passivist, who prefer that you be waited on hand and foot, and that
<BR>
other people pay for that, you do not belong in a free market. If you have a
<BR>
problem, 'you are the change you wish to see in the world'. If you think its a
<BR>
problem then you are the person to solve it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The point I'm making is simply this:  Government is pretty much a necessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil, by moderating the worst excesses of the market, as well as by moderating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the paternal/maternal instincts of the citizenry and the more demanding and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; radical elements of personal philosophy.  Local government does best when its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dealing with individual issues - property boundary disputes, petty crime,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic enforcement.  Regional government does best with regional-level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues - such things as general licensing requirements, health and education
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; services over broad regions.  So-called &quot;national&quot; governments do very well at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diplomacy, military service, and certain high-level functions that affect and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; require a larger geographic base than any administrative region could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonably run.  But at the increasingly high levels of abstraction, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be less and less direct influence on the individual, save in specialized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and/or rare circumstances (an army is invading - of course the national
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government will have an effect on its poeple - especially those in the warzone)
</EM><BR>
<P>Congratulations. You are a libertarian. ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No governance is anarchy.  Anything else is some form of totalitarianism.  Yes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even libertarianism.  I cannot be truly &quot;free&quot; in a libertarian society, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually I feel in the end I woul dbe less free than I would be in the American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constitutional system as it was practiced prior to the Civil War, though this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a discussionf or a later time, another place, since it SHOULD have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bearing on this list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What DOES have bearing here is the notion of what form of governance would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work best for an extropian world?  I have my reasons for believing that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarian &quot;government&quot; (if it could be even called that - what would it do?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not the most effctive nor efficient way to accomplish this end.  Some sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of scalable representation, with ever more diffuse power structures at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outer layers, would make more sense to me at least - let the government at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; local level work with the people at the local level, reflecting their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular desires.  Let the regional government deal with the issues affecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the region, the nationalg overnment with issues of national scale, planetary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governance dealing withthse broad, diffuse, truly global issues. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that that is a real point being debated. The point being debated
<BR>
is what degree of participation and consensus is required at each level? Global
<BR>
problems should not be decided on simple majorities.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrive at these points I can't tell you - I can't even tell you what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanics would look like.  i have my own ideas, but they are untested and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unresearched.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I ask this:  What form of governance that we have available to us today
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be able to construct and maintain an arcology-style structure, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accomplish it in a reasonable amount of time?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why? Arcologies are in actuality highly wasteful structures, demanding more
<BR>
resources per occupant than a more diffuse community.
