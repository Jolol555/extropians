<EM>&gt; Not if postbiological critters will replicate imperfectly in face of

<P>I imagine their replication could be as perfect as desired and as
<BR>
mutable as desired.  How limited are resources in a post-Singularity
<BR>
world?  About as limited as raw energy and matter.  The speed with which
<BR>
these resources can be gathered and used is real-space/time speed not
<BR>
computer time.  Ah, I see part of your point.  The fact there is a time
<BR>
disparity between AI replication and external resource allocation/usage
<BR>
makes the computational matrix itself a fertile ground for competition
<BR>
for limited resources and makes all easily available resources a ground
<BR>
for competition.  Sigh.  Is there any hope for a more cooperative
<BR>
pattern?  Or is that only a local group strategy in competition with
<BR>
other groups?
