Bonnie,
<BR>
<P>How true! You're in the predicament that faces LE people. BGH is the least
<BR>
of your worries... antibiotics; steroids &amp; steroidal analogues &amp;
<BR>
insecticide/herbicide residues are the real problem - the residues of
<BR>
weedicides are really a problem.
<BR>
<P>Farmers often bend /violate the law - with their margins, who'd blame them?
<BR>
I know of several smallholders who (in my opinion ) are routinely
<BR>
subclinically poisoned every time they treat a field.
<BR>
<P>And i know of a small amount who had to be hospitalized because of reckless
<BR>
application of chemicals. Their actual knowledge of the mode of action and
<BR>
toxicology of the chemicals was zero.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, farmers live so close to the forces of nature that they have
<BR>
an almost fatalistic view of everything... which they end up imposing on us
<BR>
via the food they supply us.
<BR>
<P>Short of testing everything you eat; you could have an idea of what might be
<BR>
in purchased foods grown in your district if you scrutinise the growers of
<BR>
food.
<BR>
<P>I became a vegan because I wanted to both lower my cholesterol &amp;  feed lower
<BR>
down the food chain... later on I became an animal liberationist so it tied
<BR>
in.
<BR>
<P>But if you grow your own and purchase neighbourhood grown foodstuff - at
<BR>
least you have some control and information on what you're eating.
<BR>
<P>Certainly it would be easier to find out about local pesticide levels from
<BR>
agricultural extension officers and plain hearsay... than buying stuff from
<BR>
a supermarket that's plugged into a nationwide distribution network and
<BR>
trying to guess it out.

Subject: RE: growth hormones (was hormoos)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Several years ago I had an experience with 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Acid--same chemical family as 2,4,5-T or &quot;Agent Orange&quot;) which is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;broad-leaf herbicide extensively used on pasture land in my region. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;related to the plants' natural growth hormone and kills the plant by
</EM><BR>
causing
<BR>
<EM>&gt;unregulated growth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My neighbor needed to have his barn cleaned out, and I needed nutrients for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my garden, so I got some good exercise shoveling manure. My neighbor didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spray his pasture, so I felt certain the manure would be safe to use. After
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the addition of the manure, the garden soil was beautiful to behold.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, within a few days of transplanting into the garden, the plants in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the nightshade family (including Irish potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eggplants) began to grow in that frightening, contorted manner which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;indicates 2,4-D poisoning--the nightshade or solanacea family is especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;susceptible to 2,4-D, so these were the first to exhibit symptoms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I immediately took some cuttings from the sick plants to my agricultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extension agent, who told me that he saw this sort of thing all too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frequently.  The 2,4-D is concentrated in the animals' urine, so the dose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conferred by the manure can be even higher than the original dose applied
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the pasture. It turned out that my neighbor had bought some hay from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pasture that had been sprayed, and this was the source of the 2,4-D in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;animals' manure. Sunlight breaks down the chemical within a few months, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the absence of sunlight, it can persist for YEARS.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The chemical is so powerful that a few molecules escaping from a tank on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;passing truck can damage cotton crops. My ag extension agent, educated at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;university which praised chemicals such as 2,4-D has come to see them as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I haven't seen any research addressing concentration of 2,4-D, bovine
</EM><BR>
growth
<BR>
<EM>&gt;hormone, or other chemicals in cows' milk, but I've seen research done on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the breast milk of Inuit women living in remote sub-Arctic regions which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have revealed surprisingly high concentrations of toxic chemicals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(transferred from the developed world via wind &amp; water) in their milk. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suspect that most commercial cows' milk contains fairly high doses of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;various synthetic hormones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Seeing's how I want to live a long and healthy life, I avoid the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contaminated milk problem by milking my own goats or purchasing cows' milk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from a dairy which claims not to use BGH (I've personally inspected the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dairy to satisfy myself as to the truth of their claim). It doesn't make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sense to me to take other life extension measures without paying close
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attention to the food I eat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
