<P>&lt;&lt; s anything out there &quot;shaping&quot; things, but because for so damn long, our 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;existance has been infinitely shaped by the thought(s) that he/it does. And 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the following mayhem or order depending on your world view. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Things would be very very different if the &quot;god modules&quot; weren't installed 
<BR>
&nbsp;in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;us. Unimagineable to say how. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
One vision that come to mind would be Gene Roddenbury's Vulcans. What shapes 
<BR>
the universe? Nothing, random events, destiny, I don't know. Maybe most 
<BR>
atheists have a low bull-shit quotient, and so to them, anything that smacks 
<BR>
of &quot;false hopes&quot; is about as enjoyable as biting on a big juicy ball of 
<BR>
aluminium foil. Maybe they fear the ultra-violence and stupidity of 
<BR>
religious-irrationalists, there is surely good reason. However, my reason for 
<BR>
feeling directed toward supporting &quot;God&quot; is intellectual cowardice, This, I 
<BR>
readilly admit. 
<BR>
<P>One of Woody Allen's character's said it best: &quot;If I had to choose between 
<BR>
God and the Truth, I'll choose God.&quot; Religion may indeed be the opiate of the 
<BR>
people, but sometimes life indeed sucks the big one and unless you Exies and 
<BR>
Trans can whip out some ready, solutions, people are going to demand 
<BR>
&quot;opiates&quot; for a long time to come. 
<BR>
<P>You may dislike my premise and attack it vigorously. Be that as it may, it 
<BR>
will not change the human condition. But this I see, materially, speaking, as 
<BR>
the central fact of life. Maybe we will turn out to be (plug) The Last Mortal 
<BR>
Generation?
