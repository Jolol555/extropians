<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also true as long as *individuals* remain the focus of such transactions.  But what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I see happening are large numbers of individuals being controlled by small numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; through the traditional hierarchy of corporations.  If this is not the case, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; why is it that less than 5% of any company dictates and controls policy while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; other 95% have to *obey* or get fired.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; i.e.  Corporation = Dictatorship.  I challenge anyone to say otherwise.  Sure I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; there are a *few* exceptions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A corporate CEO, chairman, or president is held accountable by the board of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; directors (i.e. congress) who themselves are held accountable by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stockholders (the body of voters).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If a corporation is a dictatorship, then so is every 'democratic' society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ever existed, and there is no such thing as democracy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Err...not quite.  In a democracy, one person = one vote, and buying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; votes is (supposedly) out of bounds.  In a corporation, one stock = one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vote, and buying stock is how one is supposed to acquire votes.  Thus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those with the most money invested in the company have the largest say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and they're going to be interested in making more money with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money.  They also tend to vote themselves into the board of directors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thus making the board in practice accountable to no one but itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (since they are typically the majority stockholders).
</EM><BR>
<P>In a world where the opinions of the population are controlled or manipulated by
<BR>
the media, those who own the presses are just as manipulative of a democratic
<BR>
system as a rich man is of a corporation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; An employee has the choice whether or not to be a voter, by buying stock, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as every citizen of a democratic country is free to choose whether or not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vote. Is the elected president of a country a dictator simply because some part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the population decides not to vote?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unless said employee has lots of money to invest - which is almost never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the case - said votes will be worthless in practice, as described above.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so. The employees typically outnumber other investors by far, and if they
<BR>
are unionized, their union would also tend to be one of the largest stockholders
<BR>
in the company (if they were smart).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (The stocks may be worth some money, but the votes they give have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value of zero since they're always outvoted.)  Even in a democracy (or,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more accurately, a republic, there being few if any national direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democracies at the moment) with millions of people, a single person's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vote can still make some difference - and without the motivation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;make the money I invested in this turn into more money&quot; dominating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voters' minds, other values have a chance to compete.
</EM><BR>
<P>A voter in a nation of 200-300 million people is worth far less than an employee
<BR>
owning 100-1000 shares of stock in the company they are employed by. When the
<BR>
parties are in league with the major media, which uses its propaganda power to
<BR>
program the sheeple, the vote of one individual is always outvoted as well.
