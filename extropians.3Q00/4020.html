I think we might have had this conversation before. Damn that flaky grey
<BR>
matter.
<BR>
<P>A human to do this job would work well, I guess, but why make them repeat
<BR>
what you want to say? They'd just carry some kind of speaker, from which
<BR>
your voice could eminate. Also, I guess it would be a little less
<BR>
dehumanising if you just asked them to move about in certain ways, rather
<BR>
than driving them around with a joystick!
<BR>
<P>Robotics doesn't seem to be up to the job quite yet. However, given a little
<BR>
time, it could start to come together. Eventually, hiring a robot would have
<BR>
to be cheaper and offer better control, than hiring a person.
<BR>
<P>Why aren't there telepresence operations already? The teleoperative would
<BR>
most likely be a good actor or other skilled communicator, perhaps skilled
<BR>
enough to do continuous conference-style language interpreting (that'd cost
<BR>
extra!), with a wearable computing rig. I would think there could be a
<BR>
market for this, and it might be quite a weird &amp; cool gig for otherwise
<BR>
unemployed acting types. Better than waiting on tables.
<BR>
<P>Anyone want to set it up?
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; For instance, I'd love to be able to rent a robot body for the day from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; robot-rental dealer (robo-hurtz), and be able to turn up to my US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clients
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and actually interact with them, whilst tucked in my little hidey-hole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Melbourne. I'd pay money for that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

Why waste all that money?  You could hire a real, live human being to carry
<BR>
around an RF linked webcam - or two, for binocular vision - and microphones.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fairly simple switching system, you could give them instructions,
<BR>
or even incorporate a joystick, mouse, or touchpad controller that would use
<BR>
various input modalities - buzzers, tones, or actual vocal interpretations -
<BR>
to instruct them how to move, what to look towards, etc.
<BR>
<P>Your voice would either be a speaker mounted as close to the person's mouth
<BR>
as possible - probably low neck area, or their voice as an interpreter, with
<BR>
you hearing and/or reading auto-translation via voice recognition and
<BR>
translation software.  A further check on accuracy could be provided via a
<BR>
heads-up display for your telepersona operator, who would see the original
<BR>
voice signal looping back as a retranslation into their own language.
<BR>
<P>At shows like CES or COMDEX, there are companies that provide professional
<BR>
generic salespersons to man your booth, which is especially handy for
<BR>
foreign companies that may not have very many good English speakers
<BR>
available.  This would be a natural extension of their services.
<BR>
<P>(I first suggested this I think when the Indy came out with decent built-in
<BR>
voice recognition.  My idea then was to take someone who didn't speak the
<BR>
language being used, take the voice input from other speakers in a
<BR>
conversation, run it through one of the smarter versions of Ractor, and then
<BR>
send the Ractor output back into an earphone of the humbot, who would be
<BR>
repeating it verbatim, not speaking the language.  I thought it would be
<BR>
interesting to see how long it took the other members of the conversation to
<BR>
notice something odd in this variation on the Turing test.)
