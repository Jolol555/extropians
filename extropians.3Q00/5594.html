<P>
I'm working on a piece and I'd like to run it by you all and see if anyone
<BR>
has any suggestions or contributions that might be relevant.
<BR>
<P>What I'm looking for is an analogy for how we interpret information in ways
<BR>
that are diverse and/or contradictory.  The analogy would reflect how
<BR>
concepts can be understood from, say, two diverse perspectives.
<BR>
<P>A visual example might be looking at a hologram and it would provide
<BR>
different images depending the eye level or viewpoint when looking at it.
<BR>
If one only saw the hologram from one viewpoint, he or she would miss the
<BR>
full meaning or interpretation of the picture.
<BR>
<P>Another example would be ambiguous figures:  A line drawing could be both
<BR>
at the same time a vase and the profile of two faces, or an image that
<BR>
represents an entirely different concept when turned upside down. 
<BR>
<P>We can also experience a similar blurred, 2-sided or contradictory thinking
<BR>
when we are influenced by others and  become perceptually mislead by the
<BR>
&quot;faces in the fire.&quot;  Perceiving and thinking are not independent and
<BR>
indicate connections that seem very real.  
<BR>
<P>As a sidebar, the mythological God of Beginnings, Janus, was often depicted
<BR>
by two faces gazing in opposite directions and later referenced in slogans
<BR>
about not repeating mistakes (foreseeing the future and remembering the
<BR>
past.)  Not a line-drawn visual blurring, but a information-rich
<BR>
directional blur.  Some bystanders might say to the &quot;East&quot;, and others to
<BR>
the &quot;West&quot; while both investing their piddlings on what interpretation they
<BR>
intuited to be correct.  
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
<P>Natasha
