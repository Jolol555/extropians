<BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree that any on the list are &quot;fully awakened beyond words,&quot; but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chose to attack what I believe is the weakest link.  While I do agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mohammed founded a religion, I do not see that as all that enlightening or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as evidence of being a total man -- in the conventional sense of the word.
</EM><BR>
<P>As an enlightened master, Mohammed's intent was to help others to attain
<BR>
enlightenment. Founding a religion has nothing to do with it, and may in fact
<BR>
inhibit the movement toward enlightenment. Kabir (also on the list) definitely
<BR>
did not found a religion. Nevertheless, his poetry remains enlightening.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is, at least, from my readings of the Koran and history.  (I'm sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some will disagree here, but military conquest and the like do not seem like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traits of enlightenment to me.  Of course, in Nietzsche's sense, I can see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how he would see this as part of being a &quot;total man,&quot; given his views of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural virtues.  However, it is just in this point that I think we must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question Nietzsche.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Although insightful and spiritually iconoclastic, Nietzsche was not enlightened.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, if you mean by those terms, founders of new religions or of new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosphical movements, then, yeah, they all seem to fit, though that's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying much.  Why not put the pre-Socratics in there too, and the guy who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; founded Mormonism as well as Madame Blavatsky?  (Of course, perhaps you do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since you had &quot;et al.&quot; on your original list.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Founding a religion most definitely does not constitute enlightenment. If you
<BR>
really want to know about enlightenment, then you will meditate whenever you
<BR>
can, for as long as you can, so that you can attain enlightenment. Then you will
<BR>
know for yourself. Expressing opinions and exchanging speculation about
<BR>
enlightenment are ways of postponing your own enlightenment.
<BR>
You can call it enlightenment or nirvana or total awareness or self realization
<BR>
or self actualization or cosmic consciousness or the crystallization of man's
<BR>
harmonious development or samadhi or satori or choiceless awareness or
<BR>
superconsciousness or the psychedelic experience or transcendence or the
<BR>
beatitude or zen or dhyana or the peak of human experience or hypercognition or
<BR>
any of the other ninety nine names of nothingness. My personal favorite is
<BR>
superlative sentience. It simply means the direct experience of reality.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Something beckons within the reach of each of us
<BR>
to save heroic genius. Find it, and do it.
<BR>
For as goes heroic genius, so goes humankind.&quot;
