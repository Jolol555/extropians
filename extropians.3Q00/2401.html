<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The GM crops referred to are varieties of corn and wheat that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;produces its own pesticide (much like other plants produce their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;own pesticides), thus repelling parasites. In laboratory tests,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;where monarch butterflies were given NOTHING else to eat but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;GM plants, they did eat them and did become sterilized and died.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Where the butterflies were given a choice between plants to eat,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they avoided the GM plants. The Greens have not acknowledged this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fact, and have demonstrated a rather unique case of selective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;literacy and memory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So we have fact #1) if the entire corn crop was 100% of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; variety then the monarch would become extinct.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, since monarchs are not dependent upon corn for their diet, there are many
<BR>
other crops being planted besides corn, as well as wild growth in uncultivated
<BR>
areas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now the question is at what level does the monarch population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crash? 50%? Then if half of the crop was of this variety we could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expect extinction. Actually the number I suspect is much lower, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact is we don't really know.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now another fact, Monarch's are a migrating species, they fly from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all over North America to a single mountain top in Mexico if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recall correctly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and I suspect that areas that are overwhelmingly covered with this GM corn
<BR>
would simply be flown around by the monarchs, much as migratory waterfowl change
<BR>
their migratory routes to fit the availability of wetlands.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now what do you think could happen if you planted a large enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; field of this GM corn at a strategic point along this migration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; route?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure. However, I have found from my own experience that the Monarch
<BR>
Butterfly's primary diet is NOT pollen or leaves from plants like corn, but they
<BR>
feed on animal dung. You heard it, thats right, animal dung. During the monarch
<BR>
migration through our area, I never see monarchs in cornfields. I do however see
<BR>
them congregating en masse on piles of cow, deer, and moose dung. This key fact
<BR>
in my mind tends to blow out of the water the claims of the anti-GM bunch about
<BR>
a threat to the Monarch Butterfly. What the GM corn IS a threat to is the Boll
<BR>
Weevil, which DOES feed on corn, as well as cotton. However the fact that the
<BR>
anti-GM bunch chooses to emphasise a marginal if not false threat to the Monarch
<BR>
Butterfly, which most people like and think are beautiful creatures, and ignore
<BR>
or deemphasise the threat to the Boll Weevil, which most people will admit is a
<BR>
pest that is better off on the endangered species list, fits in perfectly with
<BR>
my theory of the 'Cute and Fuzzy' modus operandi of the Greens, which only
<BR>
incriminates their personal as well as scientific integrity (assuming there was
<BR>
any to begin with).
