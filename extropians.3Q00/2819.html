<P><EM>    &gt; (W.Churchill refused a Bohr's proposal,  about the construction of the A-bomb
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;in GB,  because Bohr was so ... obscure)
</EM><BR>
<P>It's fun to plat the what if game, one of my favorites also involves the history
<BR>
of the A bomb. In 1939 Hahn and Strassman bombarded uranium with neutrons
<BR>
and produced barium, this proved that the uranium was undergoing fission, and
<BR>
much more important, it proved that an Atomic Bomb was not only possible but
<BR>
practical, all you needed was money and engineering. By 1939 Hitler was only
<BR>
expecting a short war, making a bomb would take a long time, too long he thought
<BR>
to make a difference so he didn't make much effort toward developing it.
<BR>
<P>However in fascist Italy in 1934 Enrico Fermi performed almost the exact
<BR>
same experiment that Hahn and Strassman did in 1939, and although he
<BR>
must have produced fission, for some reason he did not detect it. This was
<BR>
very uncharacteristic of Fermi, not only was he a superb theoretician he was
<BR>
probably the best experimental physicist of his age, the man made very
<BR>
few mistakes. Years later Fermi said he was very glad he did make a mistake
<BR>
this time, if the Axis powers had started to make a bomb in 1934 the world
<BR>
would be in a new dark age today. Fermi also had personal reasons for doing
<BR>
less than his best, his wife was Jewish.
