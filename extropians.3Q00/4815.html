<P><EM>&gt; The current spike in prices is not due to the suppliers, but due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  increases in taxation and environmental mandates adding to the cost of 
</EM><BR>
fuel.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Here in the US, most all the spike in the last year is a result of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  introduction of new rules by the EPA regarding additives and processes for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  refineries. The fact that production has increased by 2 million barrels a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  over the last four months with no change in prices indicates that its not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  matter of supply, unless this is a result of some european countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  deactivating nuclear plants, with the electric demand being satisfied by 
</EM><BR>
new
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  fossil fuel burning plants.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Sounds reasonable but I don't know...
<BR>
<P>What I DO know is that i'm paying twice as much per gallon of diesel today as 
<BR>
I was a year ago....
<BR>
<P>I've also had ONE load so far this month. (that i would accept...why operate 
<BR>
at a loss?....sitting still burns no fuel)....as opposed to normally one to 
<BR>
two per week....
<BR>
<P>The trucking industry is hurting due to this 'spike' in prices....and 
<BR>
eventually.....due to the ripple effect down the &quot;food chain&quot;...everyone is 
<BR>
going to &quot;feel my pain&quot;.
