<EM>&gt; Maybe we can get by without higher-dimensional waves (or branes,
</EM><BR>
whatever),
<BR>
<EM>&gt; or maybe that's just the kind of world we're in so we use what we can get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our hands on. Either way, I don't know how to make that final unzipping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occur. Run the code-string into solar plasma vortices? Into a planetary
</EM><BR>
van
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Allen belt? Into the accretion disk of a black hole? All these have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggested in fiction as habitats for smart signal resonances. I'm
</EM><BR>
wondering
<BR>
<EM>&gt; if anyone here can come up with better proposals.

<P>You could always go on the assumption that there is life out there already.
<BR>
Add to your signal the design of a machine/substrate that will decode the
<BR>
rest of the signal and do whatever it takes to &quot;run&quot; you. The best bet would
<BR>
be to make the design for the machine as easy as possible to decode, but the
<BR>
rest of the signal rather difficult; design the machine to be feasible to
<BR>
build using much lower tech than it took to design it in the first place.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully you will be picked up by, amongst others, peoples who can decode
<BR>
the blueprint for and build the machine, but not redesign it, or understand
<BR>
in any way the vital part of the signal (you). So their only option to
<BR>
satisfy curiosity is to build and run the thing, and see what happens. Hey
<BR>
presto! It's you!
<BR>
<P>Hmm, I think I just ripped off most of the plot of Contact. Damn.
