<EM>&gt; Gibson pulls no punches in this gritty, graphic portrayal of one of the

<EM>&gt; or was, much like Speilberg's depiction of WWII in Saving Private Ryan and
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; Mike, after reading your post I felt I had to ask, &quot;are you running for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; office?&quot; :)  I think some comparisons can be made about how things were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than as compared to now.  I would like to think a U.S. president and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three branches of gov't would not be seen by many american people as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tyrannical on the level of King George.
</EM><BR>
<P>So would I, but it seems that King Willy is trying his level best to be
<BR>
so tyrannical.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, have you heard the accusations saying the real British colonal that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the character was based on was not a ruthless murderer but an honorable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; officer?  Or that the inspiration for Gibson's character raped his female
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slaves?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard such accusations, coming from the British press, or from
<BR>
British writers in the American press. I'm not surprised. I'm sure
<BR>
Cornwallis reported that his men acted honorably, just as our own
<BR>
generals claimed the same for our men in Vietnam. I'm sure its rather
<BR>
embarassing for British people to see the misdeeds of their forebears
<BR>
writ large on the big screen. Denial does wonders to sooth the nerves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My two favorite films of the summer are &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;The Perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Storm.&quot;  I hope everyone here gets to see them soon.
</EM><BR>
<P>I saw Gladiator a month ago, and I really enjoyed that as well.
