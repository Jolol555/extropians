<EM>&gt; I'm a bi of a political thinker.  Not an incredibly adroit one, but I try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider the issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is goign to be an alarming thing to say, but I'll say it anyway.  None of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the established American political parties as they currently manifest are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropian/transhuman in the least.  And part of this is why I have elected,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year after year, to abstain from giving even my tacit endorsement to any of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political candidates.  I do not vote, and will not vote until I can make a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscionable choice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you for a comprehensive response. I feel much the same way, but don't feel
<BR>
that poorly of all groups you describe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We can all point at the shortcomings of the Republicans and the Democrats -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after all, they're the ones who've been in the forefront of political discourse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a century and a half.  But let's consider the alternatives:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reform.  As a column in the Washington Post said most eloquently, &quot;It's good to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see that Pat Robertson has finally attained his rightful place in the political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sphere - an asterisk.&quot;  Reform never stood for anything in particular save a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bundle of ill-connected populist tripe that never managed to forment a coherent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whole once the crackpot in chief resigned from day to day operations.
</EM><BR>
<P>And since its been hijacked by Nazi-in-chief Pat Buchanan, its become even more
<BR>
obtuse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libertarian.  I point anyon curious to a letter to the Los Angeles Times,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000910/t000085051.html">http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000910/t000085051.html</A>.  I can sympathize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with this poor man's feelings - why do I always feel like I'm walking into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a cult when I ee Libertarian political philosophy discussed?  I am unwilling to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the canonical, dogmatic approach that so many people do when approaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarianism.  I do NOT believe in the unalienable right to own automatic/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assault/armor piercing/antitank/nuclear munitions - but nor do I believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun control as we practice it in the US is at all viable either.  Nor do I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe in the philosophical distortions and gymnastics involved in such ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as PPL and PPJ (Privately Produced law/Justice) - I have news for you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Columbia has a similar system - it's called right wing paramilitary death
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; squads.  I have neither th faith in free markets nor the inherent goodness of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human nature to trust libertarianism as it is described at its core.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about left wing paramilitary death squads (which happen to be more prevalent
<BR>
in Columbia presently)?
<BR>
<P>Death squads, as seen in Columbia, El Salvador, Chile, and elsewhere are
<BR>
decidedly NOT PPL/J by any stretch of the imagination, so any attempt to
<BR>
assasinate the PPL/J concept by association with death squads is purely
<BR>
disengenuous, to say the least.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There aren't really any other meaningful political parties, but I will not vote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to align myself with religious or economic fundamentalists, luddites, hopeless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; egotists, isolationists, nor starry-eyed optimists who show no understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of human nature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Give me &quot;None of the Above&quot; any day.
</EM><BR>
<P>As a form of political protest, that is a very good position to take, but only
<BR>
if it actually serves your political goals.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To bring this back on topic, are there any political systems that seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support a transhumanist worldview and progression, or does anyone else feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that transhumanism/extropianism should be an INTELLECTUAL pursuit, with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lobbying and social education function, rather than attempting to become a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political ideology?
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps you should start by elucidating what you think a transhuman/extropian
<BR>
political platform would look like? I don't neccessarily consider that &gt;H and
<BR>
Extro platforms would be identical, since I view Extropy as a subset of a more
<BR>
general broad spectrum &gt;H movement, a subset I am proud to be part of. There are
<BR>
large numbers of &gt;H people that I don't consider to be particularly extropic,
<BR>
particularly the more communal, anti-individual borganist types, those who want
<BR>
to strip the individual down to become a mere node or cog in the network machine
<BR>
entity. Extropy is not about eliminating human feelings, desires, etc, it is
<BR>
about giving the individual greater ability to feel, to need, to want, to think,
<BR>
and to fulfill. I know Max has been trying for years to be mum about his own
<BR>
politics, trying to avoid any sort of political dogma or personality cult from
<BR>
being derived from the more general Extropian Principles. I don't know for sure
<BR>
if this desire for maintaining a semblance of intellectual distance or
<BR>
'reasonableness' has been for good or not. I do know that people respond to
<BR>
dedication, to commitment, and to the visible expression of the 'fire in the
<BR>
belly' that more charismatic leaders tend to evoke.
<BR>
<P>Anyone who studies political science can easily see that the most successful
<BR>
groups are those that radicalize things, that illustrate their opponents as
<BR>
supremely evil or misguided, and paint themselves and their positions as the
<BR>
only resonable thing a reasonable person can think. While many people dislike
<BR>
the negativity that results, it does not mean they will actually refrain from
<BR>
participating in it. They are rather hypocritical this way.
