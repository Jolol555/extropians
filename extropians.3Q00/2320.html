<P>
Here is a letter I wrote this morning and sent off to several editors at
<BR>
various news agencies asking for opinions in the wake of Napster on the
<BR>
future of intellectual property in an age of cheap duplication.  I did
<BR>
not mention nanotechnology which is obviously the next logical step of
<BR>
this paradigm.  I make no apologies for the strong and blunt statements,
<BR>
they've been on my chest way too long.
<BR>
<P>--------------------
<BR>
<P>Intellectual Property law was written at a time when resources were
<BR>
limited.  The internet allows unlimited copying and duplication of
<BR>
information at nearly zero cost. People comparing duplication to theft
<BR>
are plain wrong.  If I were to steel your car,
<BR>
that would be theft.  After all it would cost you a substantial amount
<BR>
of money to replace it.  But what if I gained the ability to duplicate
<BR>
your car at no cost to you?  This would not be theft, because quite
<BR>
simply your car would still be there!  Yet this argument fails to sway,
<BR>
because those in power have managed so far to use fictitious
<BR>
intellectual property ideas to make money off of information.
<BR>
Understandably this was done in an era when duplication costs were
<BR>
high.  Now that costs of duplication have fallen close to zero,
<BR>
intellectual property arguments are loosing their strength.
<BR>
<P>Which brings us to the crux of the issue -  intellectual propertarians
<BR>
fear that cheap duplication threatens their ability to make money.
<BR>
Exactly, and they better get used to it!  That's the nature of advancing
<BR>
technology.  Their argument is the same as blacksmiths during the 1920's
<BR>
complaining that the proliferation of the automobile was
<BR>
putting them out of business, or typists when the copy machine came into
<BR>
widespread use.  The only difference here is blacksmiths and typists
<BR>
weren't a very powerful lobby.  The recording and motion picture
<BR>
industries on the other hand are, with billions of dollars to throw at
<BR>
the legal system.  They have the might, but it does not make it right.
<BR>
Remember when they almost killed the VCR?
<BR>
<P>Their next line of argument is the claim that without financial
<BR>
incentives made possible by intellectual property protections, the
<BR>
overall level of creativity will suffer.  This is the most bogus
<BR>
argument of all.  Can anyone say Linux?!  Linux has been created with
<BR>
little if any incentive for financial gain,  yet it is by far the most
<BR>
robust and efficient operating system ever created, clearly superior to
<BR>
anything that has ever come out of Microsoft 's proprietary model.  That
<BR>
alone should be sufficient argument that intellectual property does not
<BR>
produce better software.
<BR>
<P>Whether we like it or not, the age of abundance is upon us.  Either we
<BR>
open the flood gates of information and allow everyone to prosper as
<BR>
cost of goods drop closer to zero.  Or we continue this archaic and
<BR>
obsolete charade of intellectual property rights, created by the rich
<BR>
for the rich, paying them exorbitant fees for what in reality costs
<BR>
next to nothing to reproduce.
