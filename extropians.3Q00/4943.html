<EM> &gt; You and all of us.  I have over a thousand titles, most of em
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hardback.  Ideally I would like to ASCII all the text without
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; destroying the books, if possible.  Let me know if you find
</EM><BR>
<P>I have the same problem. I even stopped buying dead tree because I
<BR>
can't move with them in style (last time I had to pay several $100
<BR>
just for shipping a few lousy printed matter boxes), and I figured out
<BR>
a hard drive in hand luggage full of .ps.gz and .pdf is worth many 100
<BR>
kg of pigmented cellulose, and at need can be printed on demand.
<BR>
<P>I would store scanned stuff at 300 dpi resolution (you can buy a
<BR>
RAIDable 70 GByte drive now, with TByte drives to arrive in ~4 years),
<BR>
along with the stuff you've OCRd. You can always reprocess it later,
<BR>
remember, the segmenting process is still imperfect. And, of course,
<BR>
the format will change three times over, and you won't be able to
<BR>
migrate it losslessly. Scanning is the bottleneck, so I would scan the
<BR>
best way you can afford, and store the stuff redundantly.
<BR>
<P>I'm waiting for 
<BR>
<P>1) sustainable document standard and decent OCR quality plus good OCRing robots
<BR>
2) a portable rugged display slate with quality approaching 300 dpi color
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laser printer -- based on an open architecture.
<BR>
<P>By the time the stuff arrives you'll be able to napster the books I
<BR>
want or buy them for micropayments virtually for free, so I'll have to 
<BR>
process only a minor fraction of my actual library by hand. Meanwhile, 
<BR>
the mice may have fun exploring it ;)
<BR>
<P>And, yeah, lugging less stuff around does really free the mind.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; anything workable.  {8-]  spike
