<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; As for the Nazis, yeah, they are no longer around as a nation, but this
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  after six years of war, millions of people killed and turning Europe into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rubble, then into two armed camps (NATO and the Soviets).  If this is God
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  answering prayers for the Jews and others truly decimated (how many
</EM><BR>
people
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  survived the camps versus the number who didn't?), I'd hate to see what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  happens when he doesn't answer prayers!  Does the Earth fall into the
</EM><BR>
Sun?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Also, while Israel does exist, its prosperity is mostly the result of US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  funding.  If that's prayers being answered, then I guess every person on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  welfare -- including big corporations like AMD and some African
</EM><BR>
dictators --
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  should get down on their knees and praise the Lord.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Of course, I know Zero is only talking about this reinforcing a meme...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now we have to find agreement on your contention that if God exists, God
</EM><BR>
acts
<BR>
<EM>&gt; through history?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really, just on your assumption that God can be proported to.  God does
<BR>
not exist, ergo God cannot act through history or anything.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can you state what criteria would prove of falsify the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existence of God? Also, if God exists, is it of practical use to you,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personally? One of the nazis, questions, according to some survivors, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the nazis were performing executions at ditches, and so-forth, was &quot;where
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; your God now?&quot;  Presumably, most of the murderers were not-atheists (tho'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some probably were) most were nominal Christians, who beloned to either
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; German Lutheran Church, or were Roman Catholics.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point was in the above rejoinder not that God has a practical use, but
<BR>
that the specific example didn't seem to support the implied criterion for
<BR>
belief.  The implied criterion was that the Nazis were defeated.  My point
<BR>
was they were defeated only at great cost and the damage lingered on for
<BR>
quite some time.
<BR>
<P>As for arguing God does not exist from the evidence of history, I don't do
<BR>
that and do not want to do that.  Historical evidence is much too derivative
<BR>
anyway.  One need only examine the concept of God and seek out its referents
<BR>
and coherence to see God is a nonexistent.
