<P>Understatement.  Think of scaling laws.  If one doubles ones
<BR>
every bodily dimension, one's mass increases as the cube,
<BR>
so 8 times heavier.  But the strength of a muscle is a function
<BR>
of its cross sectional area, so one is only four times stronger.
<BR>
So a similarly scaled person twice the size would feel
<BR>
as tho she is in a 2G environment.
<BR>
<P>The real kicker is that if every dimension is doubled, the
<BR>
moment of inertia of every limb is increased by a factor
<BR>
of 32.  So the double-scale person can forget playing
<BR>
ping pong.  She can forget playing pretty much anything
<BR>
for that matter, except maybe chess, so clumsy would
<BR>
she be.
<BR>
<P>I have a cousin who is an inch short of 7 ft.  He is
<BR>
often asked if he plays basketball.  Truth is it is quite
<BR>
an effort for this young man just to walk without tripping
<BR>
over his own size-15 feet.  spike
