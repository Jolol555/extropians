<EM>&gt; Geez Spike, what is it with excel &amp; engineers? Some years back I used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work in a company with lots of engineers, supporting small systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Engineers, I discovered, love excel. At some point, the really keen ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discover Excel macros, and build systems, which grow until they become both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mission critical and entirely broken. That was a, ah, challenging job.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, when you have to calculate a design with many inputs and outputs,
<BR>
few other tools work as well.  For instance, for rocket engines I put in
<BR>
the a typical chamber pressure, throat density and sonic speed, and Isp
<BR>
generated by a chemical kinetics calculator... chamber dimensions are a
<BR>
reult, then cerain injector parameters must be selected from a table of
<BR>
standard sizes, with consideration of combustion stability issues.  This
<BR>
spreadsheet is only about 50k and just a few sheets.
<BR>
<P>The insidious thing about Excel is that is can be (somewhat creakily) be
<BR>
used to analyze test data, with thousands of rows and tens of columns. 
<BR>
These files quickly balloon up and often have ugly on-the-fly
<BR>
statistical calculations, too.  This is the camel's nose in the tent,
<BR>
but engineers are laoth to learn a new tools when a familiar one will
<BR>
suffice.

<EM>&gt; Truly Spike, I say unto ye, venture into the world of MSAccess. You'll be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprised; contrary to the hype, it's actually a really useful tool for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; storing/manipulating large amounts of data. Just don't try to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; multiuser systems out of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll have to look into this for data crunching- sigh.
