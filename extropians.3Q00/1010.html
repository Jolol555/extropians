We are, but the question is whether it is enough progress fast enough.  Here's the problem, in a nutshell: The proponents of technological progress are mainly scientists and technologists.  As a rule, such folks are TERRIBLE at public relations and broad-based memetic promotion and, apparently at assessing the trends in such spheres.  They're good at things that by and large don't require those kinds of skills.  That's why they do science and technology and not politics and media.  The opponents of progress, on the other hand, tend to NOT be scientists and technologists, but media figures, &quot;policy wonks&quot; and politicians.  In other words, the other guys have some inherent advantages here.  Unless you can figure out how to create a secure, well funded and well staffed &quot;free science enclave&quot; PDQ, we need to be  prepared to play on the other guy's home turf.

<P>But, rich and powerful corporations that make their money and thrive based on technological research and development DO have people who are very skilled in public relations and political lobbying.  And on top of that, big corporations have DEEP pockets to dig into when they decide to have a major advertising campaign.  
<BR>
<P>Also, consider the number of millioniares and billioniares out there who made their fortunes from high-tech.  Why don't some of them start a foundation which is both a think tank, public relations org, and lobbying firm which has the budget to really project their persuasive memes to the public.  
<BR>
<P>I realize grass roots movements often have a vitality a bunch of p.r. folks and lobbyists would have a hard time to match in terms of long-term staying power.  Are there any well-lead grass roots organizations out there trying to fight for tech research and implementation freedom?  If not, what needs to be done to create such an organization and see it thrive?
