<EM>&gt;Economists have widely studied failures of markets.  There are probably

<EM>&gt;The thing to keep in mind is that centralized systems also have failures,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and those failure modes tend to be worse IMO.

<P>I see that this thread has resulted in a great many posts, as similar
<BR>
discussions often do on the net, but I fear the best that can come of most
<BR>
of them is to entice someone to go actually learn about the topic.
<BR>
<P>The fact is that the social world is a complex place, and as Hal indicates
<BR>
many people have spent their lives studying it.  Such people have a much
<BR>
better chance of having something useful to say than people blowing off
<BR>
steam on a mailing list.  Large numbers of people have considered these
<BR>
questions carefully, and written a huge number of books and articles on
<BR>
related topics.  If you actually want to say something worth listening
<BR>
to on the topic, you at least need to read and think about lots of those
<BR>
books and articles.  But if you just want to blow off steam, then you just
<BR>
need some wit and attitude.
<BR>
<P>Of course the big problem is that we live in democracies, and it is hard
<BR>
for citizens to vote intelligently if they don't understand these things.
<BR>
But that just implies that voters can't vote intelligently in such systems.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Market failures&quot;, btw, are better named &quot;things that can go wrong in markets&quot;
<BR>
just as &quot;government failures&quot; are &quot;things that can go wrong with governments.&quot;
<BR>
But just because something can go wrong doesn't mean it must go wrong.
<BR>
A flat tire is a auto-failure, but that doesn't mean all cars must have flat
<BR>
tires - you can make a tire that has no air inside to break out.  Similarly
<BR>
for every thing that can go wrong you can imagine some alternative institution
<BR>
where than can't happen.
