<EM>&gt;  &gt; Ultimately, this &quot;paradox&quot; is a false one, and arises from a mistaken

<EM>&gt;  &gt; conflation of description and prescription.  Post-modernist &quot;
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  No, it's not just a category error on the part of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  multi-culturalists.  It's about making a commitment to the notion that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it is very important for people to make decisions for themselves (that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is, free from human coercion).  That's a unique value, as far as I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tell, to our culture (though there are some important elements of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in Buddhism); I praise our culture for cherishing it.  I believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  our culture is better than many others, even better than most, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it prioritizes this kind of autonomy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Dan, I think you're in fact expressing the very mistake I was describing in 
<BR>
the rest of my post.  The problem arises from mixing the VALUE of individual 
<BR>
autonomy with the OBSERVATION of cultural determinism.  Let me return to the 
<BR>
example of the Taliban oppression of women.  The &quot;compost-modernist&quot; 
<BR>
recognizes that there's oppression going on, but is paralyzed from acting to 
<BR>
do anything about it because 1) he can't step outside of the view that the 
<BR>
Taliban mullahs are oppressive because &quot;that's what their culture dictates&quot; 
<BR>
and 2) condemning the oppression is an act of &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; based on 
<BR>
Western values.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The mistake, if any, is to move from multi-culturalism to relativism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  when the correct move is from multi-culturalism to sollipsism or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ethnocentricism.  Multi-culturalism is not at odds with ethnocentrism (a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sollipsism of &quot;we&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;) when our culture prioritizes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  autonomy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here, but in fact I think you 
<BR>
correctly identify that post modernism leads to solipsism and ethnocentrism, 
<BR>
both of which I see as bad products of that mind-set.  The solipsism 
<BR>
expresses itself in moral inaction; the unwillingness to express moral 
<BR>
judgments of any culturally determined behavior and the inability to act to 
<BR>
stop culturally determined oppression.  The ethnocentrism expresses itself in 
<BR>
the growing ethnically defined cultural balkanization we see going on in the 
<BR>
world today.  Thus human affairs are increasingly expressed in terms of 
<BR>
&quot;Serbs vs. Croats&quot; or &quot;Fijians vs. Indians&quot;.  The cultural relativist has no 
<BR>
solid ground to condemn ethnic warfare, since no culture is &quot;privileged&quot;.  
<BR>
Here in the States we see it as an increasing trend toward &quot;identity 
<BR>
politics&quot;, with all the divisiveness and victimization it breeds.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Under this kind of ethnocentricism, we are morally obligated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  respect the autonomy of others, because that's what our culture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  dictates; if we believed otherwise, we'd be wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's an example of what I'm talking about.  Taken out of the context of 
<BR>
this discussion, the above quote is unassailable: Of course we are &quot;morally 
<BR>
obligated to respect the autonomy of others&quot;, but the object of that respect 
<BR>
is the individual, not a culture per se or an ethnicity.  I have no respect 
<BR>
for oppressive Muslim fundamentalists or tribalists that perform female 
<BR>
genital mutilation, and I have no respect for the cultures that engender such 
<BR>
behavior.  As Nadia points out, respect for the purely aesthetic traditions 
<BR>
of a culture is one thing -- one can't condemn people for preferring one set 
<BR>
of culturally pervasive tonalities in music over another, for instance.  But 
<BR>
a cultural preference for brutality is quite another thing.
