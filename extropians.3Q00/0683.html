<EM>&gt; You wouldn't need to make it pink - just grow some kind of plant (I vote for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something with thorns or poison ivy) and put the sign there. You'd want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to be watching the video from a remote location, to have police at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the scenes as soon as someone showed up.

<P>Poison ivy!  Now yer thinking.  I like it.  I think we need not resort
<BR>
to police if we use an appropriately noxious plant.  We can use my
<BR>
wireless videocam.
<BR>
<P>You know what we really need are snappy sound-bite slogans
<BR>
that will fit on a bumper sticker.  The low-brow crowd has used
<BR>
this so effectively for promoting religion, such as:  &quot;god said it,
<BR>
I believe it, that settles it.&quot;  and &quot;Adam and Eve, not Adam and
<BR>
Steve.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Now of course, these saying have us writhing helplessly in the
<BR>
iron grip of logic, but there is the possibility we could stoop as
<BR>
low and have our own bumper stickers: &quot;The Greens want to
<BR>
take away our medical treatment&quot; and &quot;Genetically modified
<BR>
crops help save babies from starvation.&quot;  That kinda thing. spike
