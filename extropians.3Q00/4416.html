<P><EM>&gt; I personally think that the fact that you have found members of &quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligentsia&quot; to condemn extropian thinking as &quot;fascist&quot; is simply the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result of a lack of understanding of the extent to which a rigorous and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honest approach to questions of human liberty results in questioning sacred
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cows.  Mainstream political thought assumed that a powerful state is the sole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and only safeguard of liberty for so long that any questioning of that idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was immediately condemned as somehow &quot;anti-liberty&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please keep in mind I have never called extropians fascists - I was simply
<BR>
echoing the sentiments of others.  As most of the people I'm referring to also
<BR>
share many of our extropian goals, they have every right to question you back
<BR>
when you're advocating that all civil rights protections become commodities up
<BR>
for sale to the highest bidder.  I don't think I would be out of line by saying
<BR>
that the extreme version of free-markets being advocated in these circles is
<BR>
nothing short of a full-blown Piracy!
<BR>
<P>The problem escalated when I attempted to point this out and suggest that their
<BR>
must be a better way that does not involve government intervention.  I have
<BR>
played &quot;devils advocate&quot; in an attempt to get answers from people who are
<BR>
obviously more informed than me. There have been a few rational exceptions, most
<BR>
noticeably yours and Hal Finney's, however the majority of comments have
<BR>
consisted of:
<BR>
<P>&quot;What is this the Muppet Show?!&quot;, &quot;You are obviously a closet marxist!&quot;, &quot;No,
<BR>
there is no other way - the poor by definition do not deserve anything!&quot;, &quot;You
<BR>
can dish it out, but you can't take it!&quot;, ad nauseum.
<BR>
<P>And what utterly befuddles me is why people are either gleeful about that fact
<BR>
that the poor get screwed or at best refuse to admit their is a problem, or
<BR>
&quot;Things will just work out, trust me, have faith&quot;.  And yet ironically, I'm the
<BR>
one being accused of not debating this rigorously.  I should have added to my
<BR>
list rampant hypocrisy as well.
<BR>
<P>For the record, I would always prefer a free-market solution over a government
<BR>
one - **assuming it does a better job!**.  So as Michael Lorrey said, &quot;don't fix
<BR>
something that ain't broke&quot;.  Well, the current system we have is obviously
<BR>
broken, but is the fix going to makes things better or worse?  For the umpteenth
<BR>
time I going to turn this around again, and say if free-markets can do such a
<BR>
better job at tackling the complex issues of civil liberties, then show me!  I'm
<BR>
not the one around here making any claims.
<BR>
<P>There is a saying, &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof&quot;.  The claim
<BR>
of free-marketers is that they will do a better job at handling civil liberties
<BR>
issues.  Well, I'm still waiting.....
