<EM>&gt; I think the &quot;slelling&quot; issue depends on the level of access to cloning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology.  If you can clone and incubate in the privacy or your own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basement (a Clone@Home system perhaps), then it'd be difficult to stop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone intent on using your DNA for their own reproductive ends.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, if it's run by an organisation or govt. institution, they may have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a &quot;Consent Register&quot;, so if the DNA someone's provided for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproducing/cloning is not their own, they check it against the register,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and see if your name pops up (assuming it's your DNA of course) as having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given consent to this person, if at all.  If you haven't, then no dice, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they destroy or retain the DNA and notify you of the attempt.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's probably a reasonable approach for the medium term.  By the
<BR>
time we have Clone@Home (love that name) the handbasket we're in will
<BR>
be well on its way to its final destination, whereever that may be.
<BR>
<P>For those who say, who cares, it's just a clone, consider whether a
<BR>
more elaborate version of the same thing may become possible, where your
<BR>
mind is cloned.  Suppose that with sufficiently clever observation and
<BR>
deduction a close approximation of your own mind can be produced.  Then,
<BR>
for those who believe in pattern models of identity, it would be possible
<BR>
to have near-copies of yourself come into existence without your consent.
