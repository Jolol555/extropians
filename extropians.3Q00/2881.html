Subject: Rand and the Reality of Self-Sacrifice
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom's recent book _Global Brain_ has numerous
<BR>
examples of how the individual is programmed by the
<BR>
social organims for self-destruction in service of the
<BR>
group....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rand never accepted the naive individualistic premise
<BR>
that &quot;everyone&quot; works for their self-interest.  On the contrary,
<BR>
she always argued for the reality of self-sacrifice, in her view, the
<BR>
primary factor in the success of tyranny.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What confuses the issue is that any successful action,
<BR>
even a self-sacrificial one results in some measure pleasure
<BR>
even though vastly more substantial pains may also result
<BR>
either simultaneously or later.

<EM>&gt; &gt;   IAN: Well stated, but how do you know that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   assumption does not match the real world? Let's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   go back to my question: If the goal of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   action is not an endeavor to make oneself happy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   then what is it? Simply declaring that the claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   that the goal of human action to maximize happiness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   is a fallacy does not tell us very much. Where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   are some examples of people not behaving in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   way they believe will maximize their happiness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   under the circumstance they find themselves?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ian, either you're not reading or you're not thinking.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Savant's point and my clarification of that point are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about logic, not about the empirical truth or falsity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of a premise. Indeed, you can't get to the &quot;empirical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;truth or falsity of the premise&quot; question if you start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out with the ASSUMPTION that everyone is always selfish.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: When Savant dismissed the claim that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the goal of life is to make oneself happy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she dismissed the claim per se, which I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;read to say that its false both logically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and empirically. I guess the hypothesis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that all people behave with their self-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interest as the priority can't be tested
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because some people assume that it's true.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so it's false and we answered that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(like I'm going to keep asking Bolton for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any examples that might support his claims).
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  This is increasingly amusing. Several months ago, when I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  was &quot;picking&quot; on poor Ian by pointing out his latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  absurdity and his utter lack of credible support for it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  [I believe that it was his claim that the latest flu
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  outbreak was REALLY testing by the federal army of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;  germ warfare techniques],
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   IAN: Craig, you know perfectly well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   I never made any such claim, rather I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   forwarded such a claim made by William
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   Thomas, then I debunked main parts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   his thesis. You know that, and yet you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   continue to make such false claims. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   you say leads readers to believe these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   falsehoods: that Thomas's claim is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   &quot;Ian theory,&quot; that Craig debunked that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   theory, and that Ian is promoting it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ian, I'm simply not going to play this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;silly game with you. You forwarded the post.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When I attacked it, you extensively defended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it, to the point of claiming that I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;demeaning one of the purported professional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sources cited in the post. When I suggested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that we forward the theory you were defending
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and your defenses to that source and ask him what he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought about them you quickly got off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subject. You see, Ian, my memory is not as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selective as yours. [Also, I archive these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussions for future reference - a fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you should take account of in your next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;I never said that&quot;...]
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Who cares about your archive? It's online:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/la-agora.html">http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/la-agora.html</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can support your implication that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the claim that the Govt is spraying the flu
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a theory that was created by Ian Goddard.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can also prove that you debunked the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claim. But the sad fact is that almost every
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counter you raised against the Thomas claim
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was shown to be false. For example, you argued
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Govt would NEVER spary toxins on the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US population, which is why you had to smear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the doctor who was covering the many times
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Govt DID spray on US populations.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;   IAN: If you have any actual argumentation as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   to why the flashes are gunshots, please cut
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;   the relentless smear jobs and present it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ian, I'm really not interested.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Of course you're not interested in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defending your claim. When have you ever
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been interested in defending one of your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claims? I've had to ask you over and over
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to defend your claims... one grows weary!
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;I do find it &quot;interesting&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I first heard this claim from a Waco survivor a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;months after the events and long before anyone knew about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the FLIR tapes, but it could all be coincidence. Whether it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is or not, however, it doesn't much effect the bottom line
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conclusion that the BATF decided to put on a publicity stunt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather than doing their job, that they screwed it up [as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do all the time], that a lot of people died as a result and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that none of the BATF officials are in jail but a number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their surviving victims are serving long terms in jail.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Given those facts I fail to see the legitimate reason for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you obsession with this topic [other than the usual &quot;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to promote Ian at any cost&quot; reason].
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Craig, whatever I do you will smear me. I happen
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to oppose bullsh*t. You might think it preferable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to allow libertarians to run around spouting provable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;falsehoods about the Waco FLIR... that's your problem.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You started smearing me on the basis that you feared
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the ideas I consider would harm the libertarian
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reputation, now you smear me for taking on proven-to-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be false claims that have infected the libertarian
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;camp. The only consistency in your actions is that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you want to smear me for any reason you can concoct.
