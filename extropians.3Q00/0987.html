<P>
The idea I outlined about collecting pledges before releasing
<BR>
works comes from cryptographers John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier.
<BR>
It is their &quot;Street Performer Protocol&quot;, described at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue4_6/kelsey/index.html">http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue4_6/kelsey/index.html</A>.
<BR>
<P>This is a good paper to read because it also details problems with the
<BR>
proposed technological solutions to copyright, most of which involve
<BR>
cryptography, by people who know the subject.  The authors argue that over
<BR>
the next few decades, copyright is a lost cause.  Technological changes
<BR>
will make it impossible to enforce.
<BR>
<P>This is why I am interested in the subject; unlike Lee, I don't see
<BR>
copyright as harmful to society, or something we should legislate away.
<BR>
Rather, I see it as technologically unstable, and I want us to begin
<BR>
working on creative ways to allow artists to survive and thrive in a
<BR>
world where copyright essentially does not exist.
<BR>
<P>BTW there was an article on Wired yesterday about one of the other
<BR>
funding approaches we discussed (also mentioned in the Kelsey paper),
<BR>
inserting advertisements into art.  A company called Digital Payloads
<BR>
has a technology to insert ads into mp3 files.  Maybe all Nadia needs
<BR>
to do is to work the Nike swoosh into her paintings, and she'll be set.
