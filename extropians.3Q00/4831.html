<EM>&gt; &gt;  I don't think this is entirely true:  There have been &quot;official&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of art, high and low, in many other periods, from the influence of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  National Academies in France and the UK in the 18th-19th centuries back
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the impact of royal or ecclesiastical patronage in earlier times.
</EM><BR>
Those
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  institutions sought to create a bright line between art/not-art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True Greg, true. And those standards were severely challenged when the
</EM><BR>
camera
<BR>
<EM>&gt; was invented. Even the camera obscura (15th century) made realism less of
</EM><BR>
an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; art and more of a science.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My point is: Technology lead us out of classical art, which went in search
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the perfection in 2 dimensional representational imagery. When the color
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; camera was able to take far better images of &quot;reality&quot; with just the click
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a button, mere copying became boring. People's attention turned back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; composition, form.. and abstract expression.
</EM><BR>
<P>Classical art?  The classical period in painting ended before photography
<BR>
was invented.  Also, by the time photography got going, Impressionism was
<BR>
already dominating the art scene.  The painterly style -- impressionism with
<BR>
a small &quot;i&quot; -- existed long before and the best preClassical example is
<BR>
Rembrandt.
<BR>
<P>If by &quot;classical art&quot; is meant only &quot;the perfection in 2 dimensional
<BR>
representational imagery,&quot; then the Romantic Period -- again, before
<BR>
photography -- really did that in.  Romanticism in painting was more
<BR>
concerned with portraying the particular, even the ugly.  Hence Goya (d.
<BR>
1828!).
<BR>
<P>Composition and form have been conscious concerns with painting at least
<BR>
since the Ancient Greeks, Indians, and Chinese.  Composition and form were
<BR>
not ignored from 1500 until 1850!  Representational painting is not slavish
<BR>
imitation of whatever is in front of the painter at the moment.  (I paint
<BR>
and draw representationally, and when I work from directly from life I have
<BR>
to choose not only the lighting and direction, but what I'm going to leave
<BR>
out or emphasize.  Such choices are bound up, for decent representational
<BR>
painters, with trying to achieve the best composition for the subject.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Technology today will also lead us out of our current narrow views of art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's best to observe, learn..or more exciting - to explore. &quot;What is&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(was?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art (when the rapid changes in mediums present a landscape in wild
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;upheaval)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has been left behind in the 20th century, or discussed in the far far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course, when humans change into something else or something new is
<BR>
created which can respond to art, then the defining trait of art for that
<BR>
form of being will have to be defined according its nature.  In this vein,
<BR>
Olaf Stapeldon's _Sirius_ gives an excellent portrayal of an uplifted dog
<BR>
making odor art.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
