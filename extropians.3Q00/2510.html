</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; setting it up on your PC but for a few bucks - sure - I'll give you a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; hand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;

<EM>&gt;&gt; Obviously I'm a hacker-leach, victimizing the clueless.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, you aren't. The people who don't hire you to help them are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefitting from the fact that you only bill the clueless for your time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thus the clueless are subsidizing the software of those who don't need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help with it. What you are practicing is a reverse sort of technological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;socialism, where the people with the intellectual capital (the hackers)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pay the least, while the intellectually poor (the newbie) pays the most.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Its a highly regressive tax system, which is odd coming from people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tend to be socialists politically.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a fairly twisted way of looking at the world, and while internally
<BR>
coherent it has nothing to do with reality.
<BR>
<P>Most free software is written by hobbiests - there is no 'cost',  no more than
<BR>
fooling around in your garage woodshop constitutes capital expenditure which
<BR>
has to be recouped. If you get a kick out of of building spice racks, if it's
<BR>
something you enjoy doing in your free time, and you have a magic wand for
<BR>
duplicating them at zero cost, why not just be a nice guy and give them away?
<BR>
If some one offers you $20 to nail one up in his kitchen, he's not subsidizing
<BR>
anything, he's buying a non-free service that you're unable to provide him at
<BR>
zero cost.  Very few people  are lucky enough to make a living doing free
<BR>
software - most have day jobs. We hack on things it's fun to hack on, and
<BR>
when we come up with something neat, we send in a patch.
<BR>
<P>Most free software support is bought by large companies working on large
<BR>
projects, not struggling individuals. If I'm writing software with gcc, I need
<BR>
someone who can fix bugs I find, add capabilities I need, and port it to
<BR>
platforms I need to support. If a critical system runs Linux, I need someone to
<BR>
call when it goes down and someone who can configure it so it doesn't. If I
<BR>
want to serve thousands of hits per second on an Apache webserver, it's worth
<BR>
my while to have it set up by someone who really knows the ins and outs of that
<BR>
particular piece of software. When we talk about support as a business model,
<BR>
we're not talking about 900 numbers for struggling newbies, we're talking about
<BR>
businesses for whom it doesn't make sense to maintain the relevant talent in
<BR>
house. If anyone's subsidizing free software, it's corporate users. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; RedHat still has to pay its programmers to produce code. Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; making everyone pay their fair share of the cost of producing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; code that everyone benefits from, they make the newbies pay for it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; all.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know who these people are. People buying Redhat with support for about
<BR>
what they'd spend on Windows? If you don't have the background to get
<BR>
anything out of Linux after 90 (?) days of support, it probably isn't the right
<BR>
tool for the job you're trying to get done. Qualified people picking up phones
<BR>
aren't free. Till AI, we're just going to have to deal with that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Linux was built on support money, unfairly extracted from unjustly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; burdened, exploited newbies? Gcc and the Gnu tool set? X-Windows? Kde and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Gnome? Apache? What the hell are you talking about?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Something that anyone with an ounce of understanding of how business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work would understand.
</EM><BR>
<P>I work full time for a free software company, Ada Core Technologies. (Whom I
<BR>
don't speak for and so on.) We maintain Gnat, the Gnu Ada compiler. It's
<BR>
how I make my living. I suspect I know more about the free software business
<BR>
than you do.
