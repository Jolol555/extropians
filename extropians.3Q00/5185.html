<EM> &gt; &gt; I'm planning to talk about virtual reality: how teleworking may

become
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; popular when VR gets good enough that you can get those social
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; interactions with office mates that seem to be so essential.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM> &gt;I'm a bit involved in the Open Source scene.  (From what I read on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;this list I gather that for most participants here the Open Source
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;movement is rather obscure.)  Collaborative projects there are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;typically developed by teleworking only.  Social interaction in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the flesh just isn't an option, so it works without.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but apart from software development, teleworking is still uncommon.
<BR>
It's worth noting that the stereotypical programmer is not exactly known
<BR>
for his sociability - I wonder if that might be part of the
<BR>
explanation?
<BR>
<P>Academics also telework sometimes. During the Kosovo war, I was
<BR>
corresponding and co-authoring a paper with a Serbian physicist, whom I
<BR>
have not yet met in flesh. Except for the days he had to take time off
<BR>
to attend to the wounded, this seemed to work quite well. And yet I
<BR>
still find that there is something especially stimulating and effective
<BR>
about a face-to-face conversation.
<BR>
<P>I wonder why there are not more intellectual discussions over the phone.
<BR>
Theoretically, people on this list for example ought to be calling each
<BR>
other and bouncing ideas off each other all the time. Why don't we? It
<BR>
isn't that expensive. I have many interests in common with Robin or Hal
<BR>
for instance, yet I have never called either of them. Why? Maybe it is a
<BR>
fear of intruding. Email is a less intrusive and more relaxing way of
<BR>
achieving approximately the same end.
<BR>
<P>This suggests that part of what makes the in-flesh communication link
<BR>
effective is that one can easily see when the other is ready converse.
<BR>
You know that they are not absorbed in a book or just coming out of the
<BR>
shower. They are in the conference room or at the restaurant because
<BR>
they are ready to socialize. Also, the settings provide a shared
<BR>
context, which helps the parties agree on the right mode and topic for
<BR>
the conversation. Maybe a VR-world would have to replicate these
<BR>
ingredients in order to fully match the flesh-world as forum and a work
<BR>
place.
