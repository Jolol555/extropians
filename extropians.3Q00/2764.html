<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20StockGeneration%20story%20in%20Wired&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGGEIAGAAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.org</A>

</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one game after another collapses, he continues to try to draw people in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Presently he is promoting DigitalStocks, as StockGeneration has fallen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; off his radar, conveniently forgotten.  He has very little credibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in my book.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is something that, as some people who know me personally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know, bothers me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatly ... I've found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this to be particularly true in big cities, as well as on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Con artists have fascinated me for many years, and as most of them are
<BR>
physically attractive and socially charming I've enjoyed hanging out with
<BR>
some of them from time to time.  I think in general it's true that a con
<BR>
artist is only dangerous to a person who's looking to get something for
<BR>
nothing, or anyhow for less than full value.  I was looking only for
<BR>
entertainment from the con artists I hung out with, and none of them ever
<BR>
ripped me off. In fact, the ones who took me into their confidence taught me
<BR>
a few things about human nature, so I came away from the encounters with a
<BR>
net gain.
<BR>
<P>The StockGeneration game was clearly a pyramid scheme. How could anyone
<BR>
possibly look at the rules and not see that? It's not as though innocent
<BR>
people had their fleeces shorn.
<BR>
<P>It's true that in big cities and big countries with lots of new cities to
<BR>
start fresh in, and on the internet, con artists can bite the dust and
<BR>
resurface with new identities and new scams.  The key to doing business in
<BR>
an impresonal setting is first to look at what you're getting into.  If it's
<BR>
clearly a get-rich-quick-and-easy scheme, be wary.  If it looks like a
<BR>
legitimate business deal, start out small.  Don't quit your day job or
<BR>
invest your life savings until the persons you're dealing with have
<BR>
established a track record with you.
<BR>
<P><P>While
<BR>
<EM>&gt; some websites have established 'reputation brokers' within their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own websites, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am not aware of any large public reputation brokerage sites that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to all,
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Hey, there's an opportunity for someone who wants to start an internet
<BR>
business.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
