<P>
Does anyone else here think is unfair and unjust
<BR>
that a woman can always get out of the
<BR>
responsibility for a child (before birth by
<BR>
aborting it and after birth by putting it up for
<BR>
adoption), while a man can literally be held
<BR>
responsible for hundreds of thousands in expenses
<BR>
just because he was careless enough not to use a
<BR>
rubber, or because a woman's birth control method
<BR>
did not work or because he was lied to? (&quot;Yes
<BR>
honey, I'm on the pill.&quot;) Fair is fair. If women
<BR>
legally don't have to support their kids, men
<BR>
shouldn't have to either. 
<BR>
<P>I'm gay, but if I were a heterosexual man the
<BR>
prospect of having sex with any woman would
<BR>
greatly concern me for these reasons.
