Most old DOS games can be made to run under Win 9x using the hints that
<BR>
Amara and Mike Lorrey gave. Another problem can be with the DOS 640k memory
<BR>
limit, which may require tweaking the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to
<BR>
give enough low memory for the program to run, or sometimes changing the WIN
<BR>
9x MS-DOS mode properties on the game .exe file. One other common problem is
<BR>
how modern sound cards handle old Soundblaster support. There are various
<BR>
things to try which might help in overcoming this - different things work
<BR>
for different cards, games, drivers, etc. (Yes, it can get a tad tedious).
<BR>
<P>Multi-boot PCs can lead to a very &quot;interesting&quot; life, but for better
<BR>
reliability I would recommend the setup I have, namely two PCs. An old 486
<BR>
with DOS6 and Win3.1 on it for the old games and a modern Win98 PC for the
<BR>
new games. (Oh, and I suppose you can also use them for things other than
<BR>
games if you want to.....)
<BR>
<P>A PC version of the old EMPIRE game can be freely downloaded from:-
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Lots of old (and some not-so-old) games, that are no longer available for
<BR>
purchase can be freely downloaded from many sites. One good one is:-

<P>Warning: Several months of your life may disappear if you start poking
<BR>
around here!
