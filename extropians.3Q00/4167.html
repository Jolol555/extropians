<BR>
<EM>&gt; Let us say that I look at an orange pen.  There a few claims that I am
</EM><BR>
able
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to make about that orangeness, and each claim can be rated by degree of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.)  The pen is orange.  (appeal to the reality of existence)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a problematic statement for deeper reasons I've already given, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let's simply deal with the basics: perhaps a light source is altering the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appearance of the pen, perhaps it's virtual reality, or perhaps a piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orange gel has been placed between me and the pen.  In any case I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have absolute certainty regarding such a statement.
</EM><BR>
<P>What degree of certainty can you ascribe to it?  Note, all the examples you
<BR>
use to cast doubt on this example are sensory.  Knowledge of them -- your
<BR>
reasons to doubt -- comes from the senses.  One, e.g., finds out about an
<BR>
orange filter (my example originally:) by knowing about such filters.  How
<BR>
does one know about them?  Generally, one sees them.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2.)  I see the color orange.  (appeal to the reality of the senses)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This has much greater certainty.  You can't say to me: &quot;Aha, no, the pen
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; really blue!  I was just bouncing orange light off of it!&quot; because I
</EM><BR>
wasn't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; claiming that the pen was orange, I was claiming that I perceived the
</EM><BR>
color
<BR>
<EM>&gt; orange.  This statement is -almost- 100% absolutely true.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where do you derive the number 100 from?  (My pet peeve: putting numbers
<BR>
alongside things to make yourself and others think you have more knowledge
<BR>
than you do.)
<BR>
<P>Also, a blue pen probably would not reflect orange light exactly.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why 'almost?'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, it -is- possible that I was hallucinating-- that the pen was a
</EM><BR>
mental
<BR>
<EM>&gt; construct and my eyes were actually perceiving nothing at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you distinguish between hallucinations and perceptions?  Generally,
<BR>
there are lots of ways to tell between the two, including consistency and
<BR>
context.  (If there was no way to tell, then, I submit, no one would ever
<BR>
come up with a concept of &quot;hallucination.&quot;  We would just assume they were
<BR>
real.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3.)  I have a mental construct of the color orange.  (appeal to the
</EM><BR>
reality
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of the mind)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is possible to have absolute, 100% certainty regarding the realm of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree here.  The &quot;realm of the mind&quot; is no less prone to error.  This
<BR>
can be easily shown.  E.g., errors of reasoning and logic.  E.g., false
<BR>
memories.  E.g., imagining with whatever degree of realism things that don't
<BR>
exist, such as unicorns or characters in a novel.  If you are willing to
<BR>
disregard the evidence of the senses (to allude again to David Kelley's
<BR>
book), then the evidence of other parts of the mind should not get a free
<BR>
pass.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You cannot be shown to have been in error.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hallucinating, if it was virtual reality, if the image was placed there by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aliens from another planet, you are still 100% correct to state that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experienced a particular brain state.  Currently this is the only realm in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which we are able to make absolute statements of reality.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would caution using &quot;brain state.&quot;  If you're going to discount the
<BR>
evidence of the senses, remember, knowledge of &quot;brain states&quot; comes from
<BR>
sensory evidence.  In fact, the notion that the brain is intimately
<BR>
connected with mental activity is one based on a long chain of sense data
<BR>
and abstraction from it.  X-rays, PET and CAT scans, experiments with brain
<BR>
damaged animals (human or no) all come to us as sense data.  Even reading
<BR>
this, you must rely on your eyes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I -do- believe in the mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is your evidence for the existence of the mind?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I link the reality of my mind functionally to my external environment--
</EM><BR>
this
<BR>
<EM>&gt; way I don't bump into sharp objects.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are skeptical about sense perception, then how do you know sharp
<BR>
objects exist?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, the mere fact that there is a possibility that I can be incorrect in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the first two statements doesn't mean that I am.  I'm simply recognizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that there is a possibility-- and that these are not absolute reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a point I bring up in my dialogue.  The possibility for error does
<BR>
not mean one is in error.  However, you seem to hold sense perception to the
<BR>
standard of being corrigible because of such possibilities, while ignoring
<BR>
that sense perception is not the only place the mind might err.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And this sword cuts both ways: Having absolute certainty regarding a
</EM><BR>
mental
<BR>
<EM>&gt; state does not always translate into something useful in the external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here you hint, again, that somehow external reality matters.  I think it
<BR>
does, but I come from the Aristotelean-Objectivist tradition, which does not
<BR>
deny sense perception.  In fact, I see sense perception as the foundation --
<BR>
in fact, the only possible foundation -- for knowledge.  However, if sense
<BR>
perception is flawed and flawed in the way you hint -- which leads,
<BR>
ultimately, to skepticism -- then no statements about external reality
<BR>
should matter.  After all, its very existence, by your reckoning, is called
<BR>
into question.  Ergo, arguments about mental states being useful or about
<BR>
them helping one to survive or even about the evolution of mind are thrown
<BR>
similarly into doubt.
<BR>
<P>After all, you can't claim not to know external reality, then without
<BR>
contradiction maintain the mind often gets it right.  (I'm not saying you go
<BR>
this far, but your statements lead me to believe you have no argument to
<BR>
brake you from going that far.)
