A web page about the experiment, including a FAQ and some slides,
<BR>
is at <A HREF="http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/lwan/gas.htm">http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/lwan/gas.htm</A>.  Be sure to
<BR>
see <A HREF="http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/lwan/gasmov.htm">http://www.neci.nj.nec.com/homepages/lwan/gasmov.htm</A>, which has a
<BR>
really impressive 2-MB Quicktime movie showing an animation of a light
<BR>
pulse passing through the &quot;FTL&quot; material (with the degree of advancement
<BR>
being exagerrated for clarity).
<BR>
<P>This simulation is IMO inaccurate and somewhat deceptive, in that the
<BR>
material begins to react seemingly before the leading edge of the input
<BR>
pulse reaches it.  However if it were a theoretically perfect Gaussian
<BR>
pulse, there would be no such thing as a leading edge, in that the
<BR>
pulse would extend infinitely in both directions, with exponentially
<BR>
decreasing intensity.  In that case then yes, the material could react
<BR>
as they have shown it.  But in the real world pulses aren't like that,
<BR>
and it would not be possible to advance the pulse by as much as is shown
<BR>
in this simulation.
