</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I just wanted to let you know that the story will be out in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; September issue, and it's a pretty amazing exposé of how a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Net-powered pyramid scheme -- apparently run by a mysterious Russian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fugitive through offshore servers in Dominica -- attracted nearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 275,000 players worldwide. The person whose message on this list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; originally caught my eye -- Rick Potvin -- is now convinced that SG
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is a scam, too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was especially disappointed by the posts here by Frederick Mann,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a well known &quot;freedom entrepreneur&quot;.  By promoting these Ponzi schemes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (especially on his bigbooster.com web site) he is essentially enriching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; himself at the cost of those he suckers in to feed his downline.  Even as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one game after another collapses, he continues to try to draw people in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Presently he is promoting DigitalStocks, as StockGeneration has fallen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off his radar, conveniently forgotten.  He has very little credibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in my book.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is something that, as some people who know me personally know, bothers me
<BR>
greatly about society in general: how easy it is in large societies to defraud
<BR>
people without worry about its impact upon your reputation, since you can always
<BR>
'move down the street' where nobody has heard of your previous scams. I've found
<BR>
this to be particularly true in big cities, as well as on the internet. While
<BR>
some websites have established 'reputation brokers' within their own websites, I
<BR>
am not aware of any large public reputation brokerage sites that are available
<BR>
to all, outside of standard 'consumer review' type sites that focus on products
<BR>
made by large manufacturers.
<BR>
<P>Its for this reason that I say that liberty is not freedom, it is
<BR>
responsibility. Doing what thou wilt and skipping off, impervious to the
<BR>
consequences, into the sunset is not exercizing liberty, it is abusing it.
<BR>
Freedom only results when everyone is responsible for the  actions they
<BR>
committed as a result of their liberties.
