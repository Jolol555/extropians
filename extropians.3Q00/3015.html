<EM>&gt; &gt; Ah, there's the rub.  Why are so many people so mentally/philosophically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; challenged at the prospect of negotiating a non-absolute line of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compromise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; between these two concepts?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ever come across the idea of finding a *common preference*?
</EM><BR>
<P>One thing I've found is that most people fit into the classic scene from
<BR>
Stranger in a Strange Land, where Mike the Martian doesn't understand people at
<BR>
all until he is at the zoo one day, and sees a monkey with some food. A bigger
<BR>
monkey comes along and takes his food away, so he goes and takes food away from
<BR>
a smaller monkey, who does the same to a smaller monkey. A large percent of the
<BR>
population is locked into this little fascist/serf mindset. They think that they
<BR>
are normal, but 'that other guy' is sick, twisted, criminal, 'not our kind,
<BR>
dear' who needs to have his rights stripped from him and locked up for the good
<BR>
of himself and themselves. People have forgotten the classical liberal ethic,
<BR>
because liberalism has been twisted by the last century of class warfare and
<BR>
racial strife. When you wear people down from too much conflict, strife, and
<BR>
change, they will vote for those that promise them relief. How can you change
<BR>
this? There needs to be a memetic campaign to program people to embrace change.
<BR>
Not an easy thing to do. It needs to be low key, involving writers of fiction
<BR>
and non-fiction, as well as news columnists, pundits, and personalities.
<BR>
<P>One idea I've had is a twist on the old 'the more things change, the more they
<BR>
stay the same'. This saying seems to be typically a cynics view of change, that
<BR>
the basic flaws of the human animal is still doing the same dumb destructive
<BR>
things today that he did as a savage. Turing this around, take advantage of the
<BR>
romantic view most people have toward 'the olden days' of apple pie, baseball,
<BR>
soda fountains, and other Norman Rockwell scenery. Trying to show in our
<BR>
literature how the changes coming up in the future can allow people to recapture
<BR>
that sense of small town community again. For example, telecommuting allows
<BR>
people to live and work as independent business people in whatever small town
<BR>
they wish to live in, doing work for some big company hundreds or thousands of
<BR>
miles away in a nearly invisible way. Mom and dad can actually stay home to
<BR>
raise their kids rather than both working 50-60 hour workweeks elsewhere and
<BR>
leaving their kids home alone with nothing but the tv and video games.
