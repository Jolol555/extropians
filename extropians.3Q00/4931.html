<EM>&gt; &gt; I am not sure that fundamental values are unchangeable.  For most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;fundamental&quot; means what they are not willing to consider changing or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; questioning.  They may even thing that they are unable to question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them.  But think one is unable and being unable are not the same thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have seen some people some times shift what they and most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought were fundamental values.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         given that fundamental values are the basis upon which a person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constructs ver entire world, altering these values would mean a kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earth-shattering cataclysm. the process would not be gradual; the inner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world of the person would simply crumble, leaving ver kicking and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screaming, helpless as a newborn ... at least for a while. during this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; period, years of conditioning beckons this person to reach out for ver old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; values that have given ver comfort. what kind of motivation (given that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this person has no complete value system yet) would keep ver going?
</EM><BR>
<P>Having done more than a little serious hacking on things most people
<BR>
consider too fundamental to fool with, I don't think it is that bad. 
<BR>
Yes I did go through some pretty disorienting phases attempting to keep
<BR>
the day job and facade going while taking myself apart and reworking
<BR>
some of the pieces in most of my spare time.  Yes there was a year or
<BR>
two or four there would my attention to my career was mainly auto-pilot
<BR>
because I was involved in such work.  But as adults we do have some
<BR>
advantages.  We know lots of patterns of behavior that work or are
<BR>
acceptable whether we have a completely different or non-existent
<BR>
fundamental bedrock for them at the moment or not.  It is not quite like
<BR>
being a complete new-born again.  It is more like being simultaneously
<BR>
an adult and a child.  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If we cannot shift &quot;fundamental&quot; values then it could spell doom for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; race as more and more of the environment those values were formed in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for changes quite radically and ever faster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         just as dna structure is effectively frozen in that adding a fifth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; type of base would necessitate changing the entire biosphere, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamental values are pinned down in that pulling one of these from under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would send the entire house of cards tumbling. while a diminishing number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of individuals gather enough momentum by sheer chance to complete a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamental change, to consciously arrange this for any appreciable number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of people would prove prohibitively expensive. to boil the whole pot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water, we need to raise the temperature to 100 degrees.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>But rearranging our dna to get rid of several diseases, probably get rid
<BR>
of the biological timeclock, code for greater intelligence, creativity,
<BR>
fitness is all quite possible.  Similarly much can be done with the
<BR>
human persona to change much that many do not realize yet can be
<BR>
changed.  In times of rapid external change internal rigidity is
<BR>
deadly.  At the speed the world is changing and the speed of change is
<BR>
changing, it is either change a lot of us in some pretty basic ways or
<BR>
perish.  There is no way that basically 20th century homo sap normalcy
<BR>
will survive much of what is coming.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;         as to &quot;doom for the race,&quot; i'm sure glad that values aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inherited like genes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Dunno.  Memetics folks point out that selfish memes are ever more
<BR>
critical as information becomes more central.  We have a pretty major
<BR>
job of memetic engineering ahead of us.  Our genetic structures
<BR>
themselves may very well require some hacking to raise average IQ
<BR>
sufficiently to have more of the race help to participate more fully. 
<BR>
Equivalently or additionally we need all the internal and external
<BR>
augmentation of our abilities that we can get.  And even this might come
<BR>
to nothing if we carry much of the same attitudes and
<BR>
mental/psychological reaction patterns.
