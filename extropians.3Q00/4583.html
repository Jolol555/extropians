<P><EM>&gt; tell me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  specifically what it is you /do/ object to.  Put up of shut up:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  tell me what's bad; don't just say &quot;it's bad, but what you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  talking about is OK&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sigh.
<BR>
This is like talking to someone with earplugs in.
<BR>
One. More. Time.
<BR>
I do not say bad. Good and bad are highly subjective.  
<BR>
Plus, I believe their are important nuggets of neccesary information lodged 
<BR>
between the 'mostly bullshit'.
<BR>
<P>I said:
<BR>
<P>Destructive:
<BR>
<P>Like Punk rock, which saw rock as pompous and arrogant and overblown; who's 
<BR>
sole goal was to dismantle the mechanism of that genre __ and this is 
<BR>
important, Lee: 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;it is based on a diagnostic process that is fairly accurate. Rock *was* 
</EM><BR>
beginning to be pompous and arrogant and overblown. To my surprise, because I 
<BR>
can hardly see why people would listen to it decades later,  the punk 
<BR>
movement actually worked, leaving music in a state of sad disrepair. 
<BR>
Unfortunately young punkers then had no musical abilities to begin with. Now 
<BR>
they mostly play saddish country and western rockabilly. This is known as 
<BR>
deconstructive.  It is one thing to be able to disgnos what is wrong with and 
<BR>
organism, it is another to be able to heal it.
<BR>
<P>Libertarians have yet to show me any solid evidence that their antigovernment 
<BR>
deconstructivist theories will actually work. I am a constructionist. I 
<BR>
prefer to make -- not break. And to be honest, I am not convinced that things 
<BR>
won't fall to shit under that kind of systemic breakdown. I don't hate my 
<BR>
life, nor the beautiful world I live in.  I don't resent the people who get 
<BR>
more than their fair share. I love my planet and the lonely, silly, 
<BR>
irresponsible and nutty people upon it. What you propose though it makes a 
<BR>
good coffe table theory -- it will 'fuck things up' more than fix things. 
<BR>
<P>Beuatiful one, I see much anger in your words as well, and while this doesn't 
<BR>
reflect on me personally, it also causes me some trepidation as to your 
<BR>
positivity and motives.
<BR>
*Dismantling in anger what you do not know how nor care about enough to put 
<BR>
back together is destructive.*
<BR>
<P><P>Lacking in Compassion:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I am an advocate of a kind of love called &quot;tough love&quot;. This means that in 
<BR>
some cases, I agree with some of the thoughts of libertarians. But-- I said 
<BR>
it before Lee, you look to me like you are always saying &quot;tough shit&quot; about 
<BR>
how anyone else feels, both in your social interactions and your political 
<BR>
ones. You don;t give a rats ass about me, you call me your enemy, you say 
<BR>
being rude is a tool -- you do not display a caring attitude about people. 
<BR>
There is a constant bitter nattering about how people don't deserve to share 
<BR>
anything you have, and this &quot;stealing at gunpoint&quot; attitude when tax time 
<BR>
comes around. That's one way of looking at it, but not the only way.
<BR>
<P>There is a general laissez faire - no pity- no sorrow - about the hurt 
<BR>
feelings of others. 
<BR>
<P>In this as in all things, there are some good points that are brought to the 
<BR>
table: the support of capitalism as a self help tool, a strong feeling of 
<BR>
self ownership, a return to self responsibility, a belief in non-enabling, 
<BR>
legalization of drugs, freedom of choice and lifestyles. Many of these ideas 
<BR>
a valid and deserve a good ear.
<BR>
<P>But when difficult social and protection issues (crime and punishment, 
<BR>
institutionalized racism, indigent childcare, hospitailztion for the poor,  
<BR>
feeding and care of mentally ill, elder care, public transportation costs, 
<BR>
support for the handicapped, language anomalies, sexual abuse, etc., etc.) 
<BR>
are brought to bear, libertarians get pissed and won't talk about 
<BR>
complexities. It's either: I'm sick to death of being told: Oh, &quot;it will work 
<BR>
itself out in the free market -  or:  Let them vote with their pocketbooks OR 
<BR>
Rich people will give money instead of the govt (yeah right) OR angry 
<BR>
spitfire and a total denial of the situation at hand. 
<BR>
Libertarians are tough, oh yes, but I fail to see the love shining in their 
<BR>
eyes.
<BR>
<P>TOUGH LOVE WITHOUT THE LOVE IS SIMPLY &quot;Tough&quot;.
<BR>
<P><P>Lacking in Empathy:
<BR>
<P>Empathy and compassion are two different things. Compassion is pity. A 
<BR>
feeling of sorrow at other's plight. Empathy is the innate ability, hard 
<BR>
wired into us, to &quot;feel another person's pain.&quot; We are born with it, most of 
<BR>
us, unless we are sociopaths. Developmentally, children who are neglected, or 
<BR>
traumatized or beaten, they lose this precious ability. Severely abused 
<BR>
children can hit another and not feel pain. A baby who is properly hard-wired 
<BR>
cannot do this. 
<BR>
<P>What the abolishment of all social programs and taxes implies is that a 
<BR>
certain percentage of people will have to either get up and prove themselves 
<BR>
able to work, or they will not be able to. Since these theories do not allow 
<BR>
for us to help by passing laws or collecting taz money that protect and serve 
<BR>
the millions of handicapped and disabled and disenfranchised and 
<BR>
institutionalized and uneducated and malnourished and untrained and depraved 
<BR>
and criminal and undesirable and non-english speaking and illiterate and 
<BR>
hopelessly addicted souls... and we even go so far as to say it is 
<BR>
&quot;unethical&quot; to do so, I see no hope of making people get up and recover -- 
<BR>
ie: be the way they &quot;should&quot; -self reliant.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;And I really can't watch the decay and despair of the population above 
<BR>
without &quot;feeling their pain&quot;. I really could not. When they suffer, so do I. 
<BR>
You seem to think it's you vs. them, I see us as the same. 
<BR>
<P>SO you see... the crux of the paradox lies here: 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I want to honor the parts of your chatter that will bring about change, but 
<BR>
totally disavow the parts that are destructive, mean and bitter.
