<P><EM>&gt;That's a better reason.  One problem is that not only government and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hoodlums, but everyone else, lives constantly in fear of the citizenry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I remember when I went into a jewelry store where the proprietor wore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a sidearm.  It was pretty scary knowing he could pull out his gun and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shoot me dead at any time.  I didn't go back.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any time you cross the street, a driver could accelerate, and deliberately try
<BR>
to run you over.  Any time you have a cup of coffee from a coffeemaker, it 
<BR>
could have an alkaloid poison in it.  And so on.  
<BR>
<P>The incidence of crimes committed by legal gun-owners is pretty low.  The
<BR>
incidence of crimes committed by those legally carrying concealed is vanishingly 
<BR>
small, and I think is mostly cops.  And, last I heard, only one violent crime
<BR>
is known to have been committed by a legal owner of a fully automatic weapon.
<BR>
<P>I have been scared for my safety, but never because the people I was scared of 
<BR>
were armed.  Rather, because either the people seemed to have violent intent,
<BR>
they had an intimidating appearance, or they seemed sufficiently out-of-control
<BR>
that I was concerned about the consequences.  (Yes, if they had also been armed, 
<BR>
I would have been more afraid, but they never have been.)
<BR>
<P>I have always had guns in my vicinity, so I take them for granted.
<BR>
<P>My father was a pistol champion.  Some of my earliest memories are of the 
<BR>
various Army bases we went to for competitions.  He always carried a loaded
<BR>
gun.  I feared his wrath occasionally, but *never* thought he'd use a gun in
<BR>
anger.
<BR>
<P>In high school, in Israel, I rode the public bus to school each day.  I would
<BR>
routinely sit next to soldiers with shopping bags and Uzis.  Whenever we went on
<BR>
field trips, our teachers were armed.
<BR>
<P>I once ran an event for the Libertarian Party.  I carried the proceeds for the 
<BR>
evening on me, a few thousand dollars.  I belatedly wondered if we should have 
<BR>
made arrangements for security.  The vice chair of the state party pointed out 
<BR>
to me that we were in a room of New Hampshire libertarians -- there were 
<BR>
probably 200 people there carrying concealed.  Who would be foolish enough to 
<BR>
try to rob us?
<BR>
<P>(Modestly related) I rank gun owners -- your (and Mike's) mileage may vary -- 
<BR>
in terms of safety as follows:
<BR>
<P>Safest:  target shooters.  Gun safety is inviolate.
<BR>
<P>Then:  military and police.
<BR>
<P>Next:  hunters.  Some are fine; others are the equivalent of Massachusetts 
<BR>
drivers -- brandishing their weapons, firing weapons within range of people's
<BR>
houses, drinking while hunting, etc.
<BR>
<P>Least:  liberals who get a gun for self-defense.  Since they abhor guns, 
<BR>
they typically never learn to use them safely.  Their kids are the most likely
<BR>
to be accidentally killed by guns because their parents hid the guns from them,
<BR>
and never taught them gun safety.
<BR>
<P>One thing I'm sure we all would agree upon, even Joe and Mike, is that if you
<BR>
own or carry a gun, it behooves you to learn how and when to use it safely.  If
<BR>
you target-shoot, you should take an NRA class.  If you want to use a gun for
<BR>
self-defense, especially if you plan to carry concealed, you should take a class
<BR>
through the Lethal Force Institute, or equivalent.
<BR>
<P>I'm leery of legally mandating this, because it gives the govt. too much
<BR>
discretion, but I encourage insurance companies to collude, and require gun
<BR>
training as a condition for issuing liability coverage to gun owners.  And I'd 
<BR>
also encourage them to give a 10% discount on a home policy for gun owners,
<BR>
much as they give a discount for a deadbolt or burglar alarm.  Perhaps the city
<BR>
could also give trained owners a discount on their property taxes as well,
<BR>
because of the reduction in crime city-wide.
