<EM>&gt; Abundance mode? For how long? There aren't that many atoms in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solar system, and the concentrations of solar systems in a given space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; volume is mostly constant. There is yet no evidence that we can create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designer basement universes, so this clearly sounds like local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scarcity to me, even if the expansion front will never peter out (it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually will, if the universe will accelerate its expansion).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not sure what your objection is exactly.  With nanotech on the
<BR>
horizon we will most likely be in abundance mode on earth for most
<BR>
physical goods within the next 4-5 decades. All things are relative. 
<BR>
Did you think I was talking about some free-floating absolute or
<BR>
something?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; non-interference with one another and actually believe that are own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Non-interference? Jeez, a yet another believer in the tooth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fairy. Have you ever seen an ecology go into non-interference mode?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not in the least what I am talking about.  Please attempt to read a bit
<BR>
more carefully and please keep gratuitous insults to yourself.  I am
<BR>
talking about human beings and their proclivities to attempt to run each
<BR>
other's lifes not about ecology in general or any other broader context. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; fullest growth is dependent on the fullest growth of all, there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; plenty of good reason to keep what secrets you can.  There are people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are always good reasons to keep secrets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The questions are of what kinds, how much and for what reasons. 
<BR>
Knowledge and information tends to grow faster when the information is
<BR>
shared or at least relatively open.  At least in areas where information
<BR>
is built upon like in software, sciences, technological process and so
<BR>
on.  There is an argument possible there that the speed of our growth is
<BR>
proportional to the degree the information flows relatively freely and
<BR>
to the degree of freedom the recipients have to utilize it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; out there who will not only object to your opinions but who will happily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; initiate force to stop and even destroy you.  We are not in paradise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; yet.  Perhaps paradise will never be until we are vastly different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; creatures than we are today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Paradise will never be, period.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly why do you say that?  I will certainly not simply take your word
<BR>
for it.  Relative paradise certainly will be.  There is a question of
<BR>
degree.  Do you think we are in endless competition mode regardless of
<BR>
what technologies and changes in ourselves and our environment we make? 
<BR>
If so, then what gives you your certainty?
