<EM>&gt; &gt; modified  organisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; Surely we should err on the side of  caution ...... we just don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; large-scale GM cultivation will impact on the environment. The dangers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; H-bombs &amp;c. is all too apparent, but some new technologies might have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; subtle dangers. We are not living in sci-fi fantasy .... if things go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; in the world they effect real lives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Plant pollen is not like grey goo, so stop giving it that level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;alarmism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You made the initial comparison with H-bombs ...... I only point out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the dangers are more subtle and we should tread carefully.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I compared YOUR fears and level of alarmism to similar levels of alarmism
<BR>
about nuclear power and nuclear war. I did NOT compare GM to H-bombs. Please
<BR>
re-read what I posted.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It is more like a forest fire, which it is possible to fight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and contain and eliminate (much as we have eliminated smallpox and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;diseases).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but even forest fires are harmful .... and aren't some diseases (TB?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that were once thought to have been eliminated fighting back?
</EM><BR>
<P>They fight back where people don't actually give them a good fight. Resistant TB
<BR>
strains evolved specifically because people with TB, in their characteristic
<BR>
lack of attention to detail, stopped taking the antibiotics when they started
<BR>
feeling better, rather than completing the entire regimen of antibiotics as
<BR>
instructed by their doctors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are no remote mountains or whatever in the UK that can be freed of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bees, even if there might be in the States. But surely other insects move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pollen about as well as bees?
</EM><BR>
<P>None do to the same extent, though butterflies are pretty good, and hummingbirds
<BR>
are also, but these do not deal with corn. Corn's overwhelmingly primary method
<BR>
of pollination is by wind.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, so you question the motives of &quot;greenies&quot; who may have left-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; politics. But for sure the motives of Monsanto and the big agri-businesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pushing this GM thru as fast they can *ARE* motivated solely by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-interest and financial gain.  Aren't some of the GM crops being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selectively modified  to uptake more of a particular brand of pesticide?
</EM><BR>
<P>If they can uptake it, it would be because the plant metabolizes the pesticide,
<BR>
rendering it harmless to humans in the fruit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they want to feed the starving millions in Asia, then maybe they could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donate the $m's they are throwing at GM foods research. Why isn't the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level of research going into permaculture?
</EM><BR>
<P>What is permaculture?
