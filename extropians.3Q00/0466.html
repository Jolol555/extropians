<P>&lt;&lt; See the science fiction page in Nature this week: &quot;The abdication of
<BR>
&nbsp;Pope Mary III&quot; by Robert J. Sawyer. It has a nice take on this that
<BR>
&nbsp;also relates a bit to this discussion. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Will do.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;Unfortunately I think you miss Waldemar's point. The misinformed will
<BR>
simply believe that we are some sort of cult, and then not listen to
<BR>
us (how often do we *listen* to religious fundamentalists, and not
<BR>
just picking up stuff to make fun of?). &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Perhaps I did miss Waldemar's point?  People will always believe whatever 
<BR>
they want to, despite your best efforts to not be misrepresented.  
<BR>
Extropianism as a philosophy is already going it alone, by seeking a path 
<BR>
beyond death; something culturally, most scientists have not concerned 
<BR>
themselves with and would certainly demurr from.  Also our little attempt at 
<BR>
cosmology in the last few days would also get a eye-rolling disinterest from 
<BR>
many astronomers and physicists.
<BR>
<P>I would say decide on what you want and go for it no matter what. If Waldemar 
<BR>
is disturbed by Tipler's views being misued; perhaps he might (if he can!)  
<BR>
engage some other scientists who are interested in how life might survive(all 
<BR>
our eggs in Tipler's basket and such). This might be a good group project. 
<BR>
However, I suspect it shall only interest the few-even on this list!
