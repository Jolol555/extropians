<P><EM>    &gt;hmmm, I dont think we want them to declassify *everything* do we?
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;Would not that make any defensive system less useful, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;point out to the enemy where the weak points are?
</EM><BR>
<P>Open source cryptography certainly gives the best security, open source software
<BR>
is the best way to write error free code, open source would give us the best results
<BR>
in this case too. Besides, the entire point of all this is to prevent war so you want all
<BR>
sides to have the technology. If it really worked, or even if it didn't but the side that
<BR>
didn't have it thought it worked, then things would be very dangerous. The other side
<BR>
would feel threatened and be tempted to strike first before the system was completed.
<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;&gt; Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt;If an offensive missile's error radius is a hundred miles  that's fine.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; 100 miles?  I *hope* Im a hundred miles away.  John you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; seen films of the H bomb tests at Bikini, have you not?  Re-
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; estimate that destruction radius.  It isnt 100 miles.
</EM><BR>
<P>Aim a modern ICBM with it's payload of many warheads to hit any place
<BR>
in New York State and more people would die than in all America's wars
<BR>
put together.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;IF it is Russia doing the attacking, yes they have a jillion
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;nukes.  A terrorist wont have that many.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is this turkey supposed to protect us from? Russia would overwhelm it
<BR>
and a nuclear terrorist wouldn't use a ICBM.
<BR>
<P><EM>       &gt;&gt; Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>       &gt;&gt; One ICBM can have dozens of warheads and thousands of decoys.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Sure, but this is a capability far beyond the present capability of the U.S.
</EM><BR>
<P>What are you talking about, we've had MIRV's for years. Not only can you have
<BR>
many warheads in one ICBM but they can hit different targets hundreds of miles
<BR>
from each other with pinpoint accuracy.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;I dont expect a terrorist to come up with such  a sophisticated device.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't either but why do you keep talking about terrorists?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;That LADAR must already be in orbit  to be of any use when called upon.
</EM><BR>
<P>So why would an enemy not make that very vulnerable satellite its very first target?
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;And you do realize of course that attacking orbiting assets is an act of war
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and vaporizing Washington 8 minutes after I destroy your satellites is an act of war too.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;So then the logic behind Milstar is....
</EM><BR>
<P>Use them in peacetime, use them in small wars, and have a backup.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Do you know  that mylar balloons were once used as a visible band and
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; high frequency decoy for fighter planes?  I saw them fail to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; spoof an AIM9R, and that was 16 yrs ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>A mylar balloon does not look like a fighter plane, in a atmosphere a mylar
<BR>
balloon does not move like a fighter plane. Neither of those things is true
<BR>
of a warhead in space, it moves and looks just like a balloon.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Remember, intercept test outcomes are not classified because they cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;be: anyone with a  telescope can watch and will either see a huge flash or no.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see why there would be a huge flash and I don't know how I could tell if it
<BR>
hit a warhead or a decoy, assuming they even bother to have decoys on this &quot;test&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; &gt;I'll first send a warhead to detonate 50 or 60 miles above your city,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; First?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes first, 20 to 40 seconds before the other warheads enter the atmosphere.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;You mean, fire upon a nuclear capable power, who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;trace the launch from the second you fire the engine, and who
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;has submarines full of MIRV capable defenses cruising silently
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;somewhere in the sea, perhaps not so far from your launch site.
</EM><BR>
<P>Such an act would not be rational, nothing about nuclear war has ever
<BR>
been rational, but the terrifying thing is that people and governments are
<BR>
often not rational.
<BR>
