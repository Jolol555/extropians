<P>
In going through the list archives I came upon a thread which began as a
<BR>
discussion of &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; and evolved through mathematical
<BR>
ability and on to the ability to form visual images from memory.  Later,
<BR>
after I'd subscribed to the list, I rambled on about my weird way of
<BR>
interfacing with the world and some people commented on my apparent
<BR>
synethesia (eg. I see leaves swirling from a tree in the fall, and the sight
<BR>
of the leaves falling is translated in my mind into music and often touch as
<BR>
well, as though I'm feeling the swirl of the leaves against my skin).  At
<BR>
the time, I hadn't read the earlier thread, so I didn't know if other people
<BR>
would be interested in this sort of stuff; so I didn't say anything more at
<BR>
the time.  Now that I know there's an interest, I'd like to open the
<BR>
discussion up again.
<BR>
<P>My original reason for being interested in the human/world interface is
<BR>
self-curiosity.  I realized from an early age that my mind didn't work like
<BR>
other people's, and that as a result it was hard for me to communicate with
<BR>
them, and I've often felt lonely. When I was a kid I thought I'd been put on
<BR>
the wrong planet by mistake, and when I heard stories of UFO's, I hoped one
<BR>
would come and get me and take me to my proper home.
<BR>
<P>Later, I expanded my selfish motivations to include the possibility of
<BR>
improving my communications skills.  If I could figure out how most people
<BR>
interfaced with the world, I'd be able to imagine how it felt to be them,
<BR>
and then I'd stand a better chance of saying the right things to them.  I
<BR>
don't mean right as in politically correct but rather, right as in &quot;not
<BR>
crazy.&quot;  (people used to say of me that I was off in my own little
<BR>
god-knows-where world)(my brother once suggested that I might be a
<BR>
&quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic, but I don't think I quite fit that category
<BR>
either)
<BR>
<P>I can see now that there are other uses for this interface question, such as
<BR>
in the development of AI.
<BR>
<P>I will continue with this idea in another message, because otherwise this
<BR>
one is going to end up being too long.
<BR>
<P>Here is a summary of the previous thread (the posts are severely clipped,
<BR>
but they're available in their entirety in the archives):

<P>I have a very uneven distribution of mental talents. I've always scored off
<BR>
the scale (on the good side :-) in visualization and verbal skills, but am
<BR>
basically a mathematical moron.

<P><P><EM>&gt;I'm a mathematical moron as well. I've taken calculus two or three times.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>me too.
<BR>
<P>I took calculus, ordinary differential equations, partial differential
<BR>
equations, all, at least twice.
<BR>
<P>(good teachers and hitting your head against the wall enough times
<BR>
eventually makes a difference)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Like you I'm basically visual.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I made it through my physics, astronomy, and math courses drawing alot of
<BR>
pictures (really).

<P>I've been informally polling people about their visual imagery.
<BR>
<P>Most can form some kind of red triangle in imagination, and rotate it to the
<BR>
left, then to the right, and go on to make a picture of their dear old
<BR>
Maman, check the color of her eyes, and so on. Some are exceptionally good
<BR>
at this stunt, making elaborate flowcharts and tracking through them without
<BR>
moving a muscle (or maybe they twitch in sympathy). Others can
<BR>
`see' whole movies as they read a novel.
<BR>
<P><P>Me, I've got *zero* visual imagery.
<BR>
<P>The module's not there, apparently.
<BR>
<P><P>[the following from message sent to extropian list by altamira 6/17/00]
<BR>
<P>for example, looking at clouds and seeing hundreds of different shades of
<BR>
white and at the same time hearing (in one's mind) all these shades of white
<BR>
translated into corresponding frequencies of sound; or listening to the
<BR>
rumbling of a machine and suddenly hearing intensely beautiful music in the
<BR>
combination of sounds and seeing (in the mind) the sounds translated into
<BR>
something like graphs of mathematical functions, weaving in and out of each
<BR>
other.
