<EM>&gt; Human Nutrition is pretty scientific.  I suspect women were taught to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cook and men ignored the subject.  Maybe feeding of children was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taught to women as part of child raising, but I don't believe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nutritional requirements were known until the relatively recently, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and was not routinely taught to men as part of taking care of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves.  I think men expected their wives to figure out what food 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to cook.  What if we change this to Life Extension? 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Strangely enough, there seems to be a cultural reversal going on in my
<BR>
generation (I'm 27) with respect to food and cooking.  Few American-raised
<BR>
women in my generation are interested in food or cooking, yet most of the
<BR>
men I know in my age group are really in to it.  The notable exceptions are
<BR>
women who were not raised in the U.S.; most of these still seem to like and
<BR>
prefer cooking.  All the really good cooks I know in my age group are men,
<BR>
and the occasional imported woman.  This is, of course, a generalization
<BR>
and I haven't observed it in the older generations very much, but I have
<BR>
talked about it with a lot of people and in many households for my
<BR>
generation, the men do most of the cooking because the women either don't
<BR>
know how and/or don't want to.  (I am in this position, and am a superb
<BR>
cook, even if I do say so myself.  :^)
<BR>
<P>My guess is that society may have pinned that interest/duty on the gender
<BR>
that was least interested in it.  I don't think cooking has been
<BR>
de-assigned as an &quot;official&quot; gender role for all that long.  I do see that
<BR>
cooking ability among men is becoming a respected skill; one does not have
<BR>
to worry much about being ridiculed for doing &quot;girl stuff&quot; if you enjoy
<BR>
cooking.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I doubt that Personal Finance was regularly taught at home.  I think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most children were taught how to carry on their father's trade. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Farmers were taught to farm.  I don't think anyone explained how to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invest or save for retirement.  Most extended families took care of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the elders and let the children take over the business.  The concept 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of self-financing through later years never occurred.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I agree.  Most people are, and have always, been left to learn for
<BR>
themselves.  I was lucky in that I got a basic grounding in these things
<BR>
at home and was intelligent to pick up the rest myself.
<BR>
<P>The benefits of teaching basic economics and personal finance to every
<BR>
child would be almost beyond calculation for a society.  Most social
<BR>
problems today stem either directly or indirectly from poor economic
<BR>
choices and bad money management.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Self-Defense might have been taught in the &quot;Wild West&quot; of America in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; towns where many people had guns.  These would have been small 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; localities.  Most of the frontier was peopled by farmers, miners, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; settlers, and the like.  They expected to settled some land and live 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quietly.  They may have had to encounter danger while travelling to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the west, but afterwards, they wanted to settle down.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think &quot;self-defense&quot; as currently used is a modern construct.  The only
<BR>
self-defense that went on in the &quot;Wild West&quot; was probably against animals
<BR>
rather than people.
<BR>
<P>The reason I say that &quot;self-defense&quot; is a modern construct is that, to a
<BR>
certain extent, it implies a different social contract than I think
<BR>
existed in, say, the Wild West.  The difference is that today individuals
<BR>
have abdicated the responsibility to defend society.  In the Wild West, it
<BR>
wasn't the thug versus the individual, it was viewed as the thug versus
<BR>
society and an action in self-defense was a social good.  Today it has
<BR>
become more of an individual problem, man versus man, and if you are lucky
<BR>
you won't get shafted when the police show up; you are no longer defending
<BR>
society, you are merely defending yourself.  Current self-defense classes
<BR>
typically reflect this change in thinking.
