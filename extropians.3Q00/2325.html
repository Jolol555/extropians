<EM>&gt; &gt; It strikes me that the amount of money one has, and the willingness to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bet, does not necessarily correlate with either competence or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; informational advantage.  Unless idea futures are a social fixture, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in Stiegler's _Webmind_, one wild-eyed millionaire could blow the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is one particular example of a general reservation I have about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using markets for optimization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take distribution of some finite resource, which each of a collection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of bidders values differently: Since the individual who values the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resource most will be willing to bid most, one hopes that the total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealth of the system will be maximized by allocating goods to those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who can make best use of them. When all agents are reasonably equal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a system works quite well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The system breaks down, however, when you have highly unequal players.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rather than a good going to the agent to whom it is of greatest value,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it can end up going to the player to whom the payment means least.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For a practical example, take a market for transplant organs: I'm an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average guy with failing liver - a new one would be of great value to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me - and I can beg, borrow, and, steal perhaps $1,000,000 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; literally save my life. You, on the other hand, are a fantastically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealthy industrialist, worth more billions than you can conceivably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spend the interest on, and you happen to like eating human liver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cooked, whipped, and spread on crackers. Since $10,000,000 is worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to you, you easily out bid me.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the typical misunderstanding by class conflict adherents. If a
<BR>
liver is worth $10 million on the market, its worth $10 million to
<BR>
everyone. The only difference between one person and another is that
<BR>
some can pay for it and others can't. If a liver is only worth $1
<BR>
million to you when its worth $10 million to others, then it isn't worth
<BR>
as much to you as to others. If you can beg borrow and steal to get $1
<BR>
million, getting another $9 million shouldn't be outside the scope of
<BR>
your moral strictures to obtain by similar methods. UNLESS you are such
<BR>
a poor economic operator that you are unfit to compete in the economic
<BR>
habitat.
<BR>
<P>That being said, lets look at utility. Since most rich people, in the US
<BR>
at least, are self made, having grown up in humble or middle class
<BR>
circumstances, they are obviously highly effective generators of wealth
<BR>
(unless you buy the false premise of socialists that all wealth is
<BR>
stolen, though from who they can't seem to demonstrate), so by the
<BR>
market giving them the liver instead of you, who admit that you cannot
<BR>
generate $10 million in wealth by honest economic means, they are making
<BR>
best use of that resource to enable them to continue to go on generating
<BR>
far more wealth in the economy than you ever have. So the system has not
<BR>
broken down, it has merely proven YOU economically unfit to get a liver
<BR>
if such are in short supply (and if they were allowed to be bid on like
<BR>
this).
