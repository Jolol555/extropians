<P><EM> &gt; That's because you are an intelligent entity. The AI, in contrast, must conform

<EM> &gt; to the program that coders give it. &lt;grrrin&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Such as the atoms in your body must conform to the natural laws
<BR>
governing their behaviour. Or as the neurons in a biologically
<BR>
realistic (such as lobster gastric ganglion) simulation produce their
<BR>
spikes according to the program codifying their behaviour. Or as an
<BR>
NP-complete problem of a nontrivial size is being solved by a computer
<BR>
program.
<BR>
<P>These are all true statements, but they're also rather irrelevant,
<BR>
because they do not impose any noticeable constraints on system
<BR>
state. In all these cases, you can't prove that system A in state B
<BR>
reaches state C after N steps, without traversing every single state
<BR>
leading from B to C.
<BR>
<P>Because behaviour is phenotype of above state changes over time, the
<BR>
problem of predicting behaviour with absolute certainty is impossible
<BR>
for a class of observers less than omniscient. All assuming, of
<BR>
course, that you can cleanly classify all behaviour into &quot;desireable&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;undesireable&quot; bins.
