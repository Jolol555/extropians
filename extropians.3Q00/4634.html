<BR>
---------------------- Journeyman (09/08/00; msg#: 36268)
<BR>
<P>So far we've discovered in previous installments that almost no-
<BR>
one likes free-trade except our schizophrenic &quot;consumer-half&quot;. 
<BR>
We've also learned that the logic of &quot;comparative advantage&quot;
<BR>
suggests we'd almost have to be crazy _NOT_ to trade - - - and
<BR>
that interfering with trade is generally _not_ &quot;in the common
<BR>
interest.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Further we've learned that free markets don't exist because they
<BR>
are supressed largely by a traditional alliance between &quot;vested
<BR>
interests of entrepreneurs, capitalists, land-owners, and
<BR>
workers&quot; in cahoots with governments, and that since these
<BR>
supressions are administered by governments, they end up doing
<BR>
very little protecting but a lot of taxing.
<BR>
<P>Additonally we found out that jobs aren't really lost, but
<BR>
instead, as a result of increasing efficiencies (including better
<BR>
&quot;capital equipment&quot;), people are just freed-up from older types
<BR>
of employment and find new jobs. These gains in efficiency
<BR>
result in more &quot;stuff&quot; produced per man hour, which is commonly
<BR>
called &quot;productivity.&quot; Increasing productivity is important, as
<BR>
Alan Greenspan suggests, because &quot;ultimately the standard of
<BR>
living of human beings is determined by the output per worker.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>We also saw that there are at least three logical problems with
<BR>
free trade, which we labeled for convenience, &quot;sociological&quot;
<BR>
problems, &quot;dependency&quot; problems, and &quot;(fiat) currency&quot; problems.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure by now you've probably begun taking sleeping pills just
<BR>
so you can dull your insatiable curiosity, as to what's going to
<BR>
happen in the next installment of this saga. Well, here's just
<BR>
what you've been waiting for!!
<BR>
<P>_Free-trade and the money problem_
<BR>
<P>The essence of the free-trade money problem is that history
<BR>
proves the trade value of any &quot;fiat&quot; (i.e. paper/megabyte)
<BR>
dollar, yen, pound, etc. note, no matter what numbers and symbols
<BR>
are printed on it, can and usually does go to effectively zero at
<BR>
some unpredictable point, usually quite rapidly. This is what
<BR>
FOA/TrailGuide means when he talks about the dollar being near
<BR>
the end of it's &quot;timeline.&quot; Additionally history proves that the
<BR>
value of these fiat certificates always, _always_, *always*,
<BR>
_*always,*_ *ALWAYS* *_ALWAYS*_ depreciates, that is loses buying
<BR>
power year after year after year. _*EVERY*_ year. These days,
<BR>
the result of this depreciation -- over-all higher prices -- is
<BR>
called &quot;inflation.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>There is a common cause for both these defects in paper/megabyte
<BR>
money: governments, usually these days in cahoots with so-called
<BR>
&quot;central banks,&quot; endlessly increase the fiat supply. The Law of
<BR>
Supply and Demand says this increased supply will cause the
<BR>
fiat's value to drop --- and it does. _*EVERY*_ year. Yearly
<BR>
inflation is the incontrovertible evidence of this excessive
<BR>
money creation.
<BR>
<P>When &quot;they&quot; increase the money supply _too much_, eventually the
<BR>
value drops as everyone tries to unload the currency at once and
<BR>
you get sudden hyper-inflation, what Austrian economists call the
<BR>
&quot;katastrophenhausse&quot; or &quot;crack-up boom.&quot; Theoretically
<BR>
governments and/or central banks could control themselves and
<BR>
stop issuing excess currency. But they never have.
<BR>
<P>It's the fact that these paper/megabyte notes can go to
<BR>
essentially zero value that distinguishes modern &quot;fiat&quot; money
<BR>
from &quot;hard&quot; money, that is, from gold and silver. Because of
<BR>
gold's history and since its value is directly proportional to
<BR>
its mass (weight), people inherently believe gold won't lose much
<BR>
of its value -- after all, even if gold's &quot;price&quot; drops a little,
<BR>
its _weight_ doesn't change does it? 
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, modern paper-backed currency notes count
<BR>
instead on symbols and government &quot;fiats&quot; or &quot;proclamations&quot;
<BR>
(&quot;THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE&quot; --
<BR>
whether you like it or not, sucker) to convince people of the
<BR>
paper certificates' worth and to accept them in trade. It is the
<BR>
&quot;fiat&quot; or &quot;proclamation&quot; part of the package that causes those in
<BR>
the know to refer to all modern currencies as &quot;fiat currencies,&quot;
<BR>
&quot;fiat&quot; for short. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well, I think you have to define what you mean by a
<BR>
free market. If you have a fiat currency, which is what
<BR>
everyone has in the world --- ...&quot; -Alan Greenspan
<BR>
<P>&quot;That's not a free market.&quot; -Congressman Ron Paul
<BR>
<P>&quot;That is not a free market.&quot; -Federal Reserve Chairman
<BR>
Alan Greenspan, Semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins Testimony to US
<BR>
House, July 22, 1998 
<BR>
<P>A five dollar gold piece weighs only about a forth as much as a
<BR>
$20 dollar gold piece. A five-dollar bill on the other hand
<BR>
weighs exactly the same as a twenty-dollar bill, or for that
<BR>
matter, a one-dollar bill or a one-hundred dollar bill. Only the
<BR>
different symbols and numbers printed on paper money convince
<BR>
people they have different values -- or any value at all. 
<BR>
<P>Once people lose faith in those symbols and numbers, fiat has no
<BR>
weight to back it up and, government proclamation or not, people
<BR>
become increasingly reluctant to accept it. An ounce of gold is
<BR>
an ounce of gold, with or without symbols, with or without a
<BR>
government fiat. It's a psychological thing -- but a very
<BR>
powerful and important one indeed. 
<BR>
<P>With gold, &quot;the buck stops here.&quot; People have always accepted
<BR>
gold as payment in full and always accepted it in trade. In
<BR>
practice gold has _never_ acted like an IOU that might not be
<BR>
good anymore. Fiat eventually always has. And additionally, if
<BR>
history is any guide at all, because of &quot;inflation&quot; you can be
<BR>
absolutely certain those fiat certificates -- unlike the gold --
<BR>
you've been stashing under the mattress will buy less at year's
<BR>
end than they do today. Fiat virtually NEVER goes up in terms of
<BR>
what it can buy -- except in rare cases when productivity in
<BR>
isolated products temporarily out-runs money-supply inflation.
<BR>
<P>You can see why accepting fiat IOUs for your savings in lieu of
<BR>
gold, like accepting a promise to deliver food later instead of
<BR>
taking delivery and storing it yourself, can be risky. The real
<BR>
essence of the situation is that as long as all the links in the
<BR>
supply chain from producer to your dinner table are sound,
<BR>
everything's OK. But what if the IOUs go bad? 
<BR>
<P>There is indeed a potential problem with free trade directly
<BR>
related to the above considerations - - - especially if you're
<BR>
using what amounts to fiat IOUs which are very widely accepted in
<BR>
trade outside the country of orgin. Like the dollar is. 
<BR>
Remember, these megabyte IOUs have no floor value. Unlike gold,
<BR>
they can drop to zero value in a crack-up boom. And once
<BR>
attuned, _everyone_ can see that zero-value potential, especially
<BR>
once a crack-up boom actually starts. 
<BR>
<P>If &quot;foreigners&quot; were holding hard money -- gold or silver
<BR>
remember -- they wouldn't be likely to believe it's value could
<BR>
go to zero and so suddenly try to unload it, thus causing the
<BR>
fabled &quot;crack-up boom.&quot; But if they're holding paper/megabyte
<BR>
fiat money and realizing its value is based only on the symbols
<BR>
printed on it and thus _could_ drop to zero, they easily might
<BR>
decide to unload it. 
<BR>
<P>Thus free trade -- using gold -- poses no threat to your domestic
<BR>
money system. A so-called &quot;trade imbalance&quot; or &quot;current account
<BR>
deficit&quot; won't lead to the sudden loss of value in your gold
<BR>
denominated savings and buying power. And a &quot;current account
<BR>
deficit&quot; is much more easily understood as &quot;gold shipped
<BR>
overseas.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, if you've been sending those megabyte-paper-
<BR>
fiat symbolic IOUs overseas in return for imported goods (instead
<BR>
of sending gold), the &quot;foreigners&quot; holding these IOUs could very
<BR>
logically decide to suddenly repatriate them. This would cause a
<BR>
sudden drastic depreciation in the trade value of the actual
<BR>
paper currency (or accounts of any kind denominated in that
<BR>
currency) that you hold. The value of these accounts _could_ go
<BR>
to virtually zero remember, creating major havoc in your life and
<BR>
your country -- and in the case of the &quot;dollar,&quot; in the whole
<BR>
world. THUS A MAIN PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH &quot;FREE TRADE&quot; ISN'T
<BR>
REALLY A PROBLEM WITH FREE TRADE AT ALL: IT'S A PROBLEM WITH FIAT
<BR>
CURRENCY INSTEAD.
<BR>
<P>Large numbers of people recognizing that there is an over-supply
<BR>
of fiat money and recognizing that the currency is over-valued
<BR>
and a crack-up boom _could_ start is often enough to start one. 
<BR>
This is the condition, like a supersaturated solution, when a
<BR>
single event, a single crystal, dropped into the mix can start
<BR>
the sudden percipitation of the fiat to the bottom of the beaker. 
<BR>
This is the current situation with the &quot;dollar.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If you want to understand the implications of this huge overseas
<BR>
build-up of paper/megabyte dollars (and it is huge) as a result
<BR>
of record &quot;trade imbalances&quot; check out &quot;BIG-FLOAT: The American
<BR>
Damocles,&quot; by L. Reichard White, available at:

<BR>
<P>Or alternatively click on the (same) link in the header to this
<BR>
message.
<BR>
<P>There's another fiat money related trade problem we already know
<BR>
about: If you've gotten addicted to trading with either your
<BR>
shoemaker, or your friendly mechanized mid-west mega-farm, and
<BR>
haven't been making shoes or growing food yourself - - - and
<BR>
anything disrupts trade, especially all of a sudden, you've got
<BR>
the dependency problem. And if your neighbors depend on trade
<BR>
for their income, you've all got &quot;sociological&quot; problems!
<BR>
<P>Usually this doesn't happen, but there is one thing that can very
<BR>
severely disrupt both shoe trading and wheat trading, not to
<BR>
mention every other kind of trading all at once and all-of-a-
<BR>
sudden. Yep, katastrophenhausse! This is particularly true if
<BR>
the trade is cross-border trade with folks using different
<BR>
national brands of money. If everyone were using gold-backed
<BR>
currency, of course, crack-up booms simply wouldn't ever happen. 
<BR>
And any remaining trade disruptions that DID happen would not be
<BR>
related directly to the value of the money. Nor would they be
<BR>
&quot;systemic.&quot;

<P>=======
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings 
<BR>
from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If 
<BR>
there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was 
<BR>
done in the case of gold [Soviet Union, 1929; USA, 1933]. If everyone decided,
<BR>
for example, to convert all his bank deposits to silver or copper or any 
<BR>
other good, and thereafter declined to accept checks as payment for goods, 
<BR>
bank deposits would lose their purchasing power and government-created bank 
<BR>
credit would be worthless as a claim on goods. The financial policy of the 
<BR>
welfare state requires there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect 
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades agains gold.
<BR>
Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the &quot;hidden&quot; confiscation of wealth.
<BR>
Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of
<BR>
property rights. If one grasps this, one has no difficulty in understanding 
<BR>
the statists' antagonism toward the gold standard.&quot;
