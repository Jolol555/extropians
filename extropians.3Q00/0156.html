<EM>&gt;As part of my critical thinking class, I cover critical thinking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about investing and personal finance. I always ask how many of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;students have covered any of this before. Usually not one person 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;raises their hand. They seem to find that particular topic the most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engaging one of all. I'm always stunned to find that financial 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;planning, basic logic, and evolutionary theory, are almost never 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taught in schools, at least based on the many hundreds of students I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have surveyed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have had the same experience.  There are certain core subjects that 
<BR>
I think should be taught to everyone, but aren't.  What would be a 
<BR>
list of these subjects.  I think we could agree on the common 
<BR>
requirements, Reading, Writing, Arithmatic, Science, History. 
<BR>
Literature, etc.
<BR>
<P>The missing ones would probably include:  Human Nutrition, Personal 
<BR>
Finance, Comparative Political Systems, Comparative Economics, 
<BR>
Self-Defense, Scientific Method, Logic, Philosophy, Art....
<BR>
<P>Anything else?
