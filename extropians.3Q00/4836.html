<EM>&gt;&gt; One more advantage to cloning:

<EM>&gt;&gt; The parent who is not contributing biologically could have sex with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; partner's clone without committing incest.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;	however, the major objection most people have to incest has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nothing to do with conscious calculation of genetics ... incest taboo is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an evolved adaptation rationalized as a moral axiom. even though the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ultimate reason for this adaptation is genetic, it doesn't really matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because we are what we are ... and until we change what we are it's still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going to be really difficult to change what we do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, somewhere I have a paper on the subject, from AAAS a few years ago.  
<BR>
What follows is mostly from memory.
<BR>
<P>Curiously, while a social incest taboo is universal, biological incest is 
<BR>
also widespread and accepted throughout large chunks of the world.  
<BR>
Particularly in a swath from Africa to East Asia, roughly matching the 
<BR>
Moslem world.  In some countries (I'm remembering Pakistan), biological 
<BR>
incest accounts for as many as 70% of all marriages.
<BR>
<P>Each culture defines some relations as acceptable, or even preferred, and
<BR>
some as taboo, without regard to the actual degree of genetic relatedness.
<BR>
<P>For example, a girl might routinely marry her mother's brother, but not her
<BR>
father's brother.    
<BR>
<P>It seems to be much more about social and family structures in each 
<BR>
society, and avoiding psychological consequences.  So, in Israel, there's
<BR>
a de facto taboo against dating between unrelated kids raised together on a
<BR>
kibbutz.
<BR>
<P>Incest shows up in US popular entertainment occasionally.  &quot;Sin of Innocence&quot;
<BR>
(1986) attempted to shock the audience with social incest.  Widower and
<BR>
divorcee get married, and their unrelated teenage kids fall in love.  
<BR>
&lt;Gasp!  What will the neighbours say!&gt;
<BR>
<P>For 2000, that's too tame.  There's a new teen show, Young Americans, that
<BR>
started this summer.  One of the plot lines is that a teenage boy and girl 
<BR>
fall in love, and then discover that they may be half-siblings.  So they 
<BR>
struggle to not care for each other.  The audience is teased with the 
<BR>
question of whether they really are related or not.
<BR>
<P>As I see it, the two issues are psychological harm and making deformed
<BR>
babies.  I don't think the former applies in this situation, and there are 
<BR>
obvious ways for a couple to avoid the latter.  Neither of which a broadcast 
<BR>
tv show is likely to mention....  I imagine the show will cop out after 
<BR>
milking the story line as long as they can.
