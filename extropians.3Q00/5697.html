<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; accomplished more than they ever can.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Could you please rephrase this? If you mean that Super-AI would make human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; intellectual activities largely obsolete, then that may be a major source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of resistance to any such project.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;rephrase mode&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AI/SI/TS will accomplish (&quot;in terms which laymen can understand&quot;) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obsolescence of lay persons, and in fact it has already made them obsolete due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to their inability to understand the process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;/rephrase mode&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lay persons will not become a major source of resistance to this project because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lay persons, for the most part, don't believe that machines can become truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent. (Ask the lay person on the street if you doubt this.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lay persons generally scoff at the idea of Artificial Life. They won't believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it until they see it happen. By then, it will be too late to put the genie back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the bottle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't recommend that extropians try to persuade the general public that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Artificial Life is probable in our lifetime, because as long as they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe it's possible, they won't interfere with the project. What they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know can't hurt us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>So, let us keep the masses ignorant heh?  Where have we heard that
<BR>
before? So, we can get to the great and wondrous technological Advent if
<BR>
only the unwashed never get wind of it?  This is a two-edged sword. 
<BR>
When the masses hear about it they will hear through voices of alarm and
<BR>
most-likely uninformed voices calling for our heads and entrails as
<BR>
traitors to all humanity.  Think about it.
