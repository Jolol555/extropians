Uh, all my Barbie's eventually busted their lower leg off at the knee. If you notice the legs are made out of softer material (for the required bending of the knees so they could 'walk' ) than the rest of the body. I used to let my neighborhood bestfriends (Toni and DeeDee) borrow my Barbie's, and they would be returned without legs. (also, once my Cher doll was borrowed, hair cut off, and turned into a man, due to lack of Ken dolls) No matter, can always go back to designing cities in the dirt for my Hot Wheels.
<BR>
On a side note, I would have to say that Barbie was not the most &quot;extropic doll&quot; I had, it was the BIONIC WOMAN, she even had removable robotic parts, that one could peer into.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligent Technology: Just ask Mattel; they'll tell you that Barbie technology is the most intelligent thing they've pursued. Also, she's made of durable plastic (even little kids don't seem to be able to break her; I've watched my daughter try). She'll be in tip-top condition, thousands of years from now.
