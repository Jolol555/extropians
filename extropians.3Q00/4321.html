<EM>&gt; Until I can see a more honest and non-hostile attitude that is willing to discuss

<EM>&gt; free-market solutions to pressing issues such as DeCSS and basic civil liberties,

<EM>&gt; I'm boycotting the institute and this list indefinitely.  This includes actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encouraging as many people as possible to avoid anything related to Extropy(TM)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Institute as well as anyone else who advocates free market solutions that come at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the expense of individual liberty.

<P>I don't think you are being completely consistent.  You opened your
<BR>
letter with,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And to think I was actually beginning to worry when I didn't see predictable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knee-jerk reactions on this issue.  Remember my worry when no one responded to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initial post after the first two days?  I thought to myself, &quot;where is Michael or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lee Danial Crocker?  Did everyone fall asleep?&quot;  But alas, some things never change,
</EM><BR>
<P>And sure enough, Mike Lorrey eventually obliged you by responding with
<BR>
a conventional libertarian response, albeit presented in his often
<BR>
intemperate communication style.
<BR>
<P>Yet as you yourself point out, you were engaged in discussion by many
<BR>
other list members that was generally reasoned and calm.  Some people
<BR>
agreed with you, such as Emlyn.  Others disagreed with some aspects but
<BR>
framed the discussion in an open minded manner.
<BR>
<P>If you want to organize a boycott, of course that is your choice.
<BR>
But to attribute a dishonest and hostile attitude to the list as a whole,
<BR>
based on one or two members, does not seem reasonable.
