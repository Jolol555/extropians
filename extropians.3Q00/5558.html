<P><EM>&gt;Striving for excellence is excellent. Where's the room for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spirituality/mysticism/religosity? Why do we need it?
</EM><BR>
<P>psychological support, connectedness, strength, warmth
<BR>
<P>However one defines &quot;god&quot; for oneself, that extra dimension
<BR>
(spirituality, etc.) in one's life can give the above. For me, this
<BR>
is true, even if one defines &quot;god&quot; to be some aspect of yourself.
<BR>
Why is that? Because each of us are alone.
<BR>
<P>No matter who may be around us for giving love and support,
<BR>
ultimately each of us are alone. I don't think many people
<BR>
understand and know the value of facing their own Abyss, but this is
<BR>
the psychological place where one must learn to sit and have a quiet
<BR>
tea in order to learn how not to run away from ourselves. The Abyss
<BR>
is a terrifying freefall place where one sees that there is no
<BR>
support outside of oneself. And the Abyss provides the
<BR>
framework with which we can grow our true selves.
<BR>
<P>Growing our true selves, following our life path, is a process:

<BR>
---------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P>Failures and mistakes are an integral part of living and growing and
<BR>
taking risks, and sometimes it's excruciatingly hard to know if one
<BR>
is following in the right path of being true to oneself. So
<BR>
therefore, the &quot;psychological support, connectedness, strength,
<BR>
warmth&quot; etc. become very helpful (and important).
<BR>
<P>I define the word &quot;god&quot; in my own way, given that I'm an atheist by
<BR>
most people's definition. And in my quasi-Buddhist-Amara's-god-universe-
<BR>
perspective, my spiritual world is important to give me support when I
<BR>
hit those OOPSes on my life-path.
<BR>
<P>To end this note, here are some inspirational words that I like alot.
<BR>
<P>(I substitute &quot;Universe&quot; wherever the word &quot;God&quot; appears, but please
<BR>
substitute whatever is appropriate for your world-view.)
<BR>
<P>---begin{quote}
<BR>
<P>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
<BR>
<P>Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
<BR>
<P>It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
<BR>
<P>We ask ourselves,
<BR>
Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?
<BR>
<P>Actually, who are you not to be?
<BR>
<P>You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world.
<BR>
<P>There's nothing enlightened about shrinking
<BR>
so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
<BR>
<P>We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
<BR>
<P>It's not just in some of us; It's in everyone.
<BR>
<P>And as we let our own light shine,
<BR>
We unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
<BR>
<P>As we are liberated from our own fear,
<BR>
Our presence automatically liberates others.
