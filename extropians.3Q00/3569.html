<EM>&gt; For instance, I'd love to be able to rent a robot body for the day from a US

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and actually interact with them, whilst tucked in my little hidey-hole in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Melbourne. I'd pay money for that.

<P>I like this idea.  It may grow out of the teleconferencing industry.  I suspect
<BR>
we will go a long way with just projecting your image, but when it comes to
<BR>
actually manipulating objects, you need some hands.  You would expect to see
<BR>
this start in the area of very specialized activity.  For example, it would nice
<BR>
for local police to maintain a teleoperated bomb disposal robot, so that when
<BR>
the need comes up, they dial up a contract expert somewhere and go do the job.
<BR>
The same would be true for teams of rescue workers, and cleanup for hazardous
<BR>
spills.
<BR>
<P>About 20 years ago, I spent some time thinking about this for teams of
<BR>
teleoperated robots that would work in earth orbit.  They would be doing things
<BR>
like putting together space station sections, fixing communication satellites
<BR>
and running experiment labs.  The operators on earth would have a staff that
<BR>
&quot;plugged in&quot; during shifts giving 24-7 coverage for the team.  The economics did
<BR>
not work out for this as a business then, but robots are getting cheaper, and
<BR>
space construction more desirable.
<BR>
<P>I am, however, now active on the other end of the size scale.  This is to make
<BR>
teleoperated robots in the micro world.  When I get this together, teams of
<BR>
workers will be able to get into their VR stations and be transported to a
<BR>
construction site that is actually deep inside a scanning electron microscope.
