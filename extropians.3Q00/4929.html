<EM>&gt; I tried.  I really tried to stay out of this, but I cannot any more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The idea that I or anyone I know who values individual liberty would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to be involved with putting Bush or Gore in the White House makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me want to vomit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I too want the right to defend myself.  But you know what?  There's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a single non-libertarian candidate who will stand up for your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right to own the weapons of your choice.  And I mean *any* weapon you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choose.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want a candidate who will say that it was and is wrong that so many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fellow US citizens I know have been arrested, imprisoned, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise persecuted for their choice of drugs.  Any candidate who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believes that those people deserved what they got and that I or any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my friends should be in jail cannot have my vote.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jail is a pretty big threat to liberty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any candidate who doesn't want to do away with seizures of property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through income taxes doesn't deserve my vote and doesn't deserve your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vote.  Any candidate who wants to eliminate patients' rights to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medical procedures from their doctors, such as abortions, or drugs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as RU-486 doesn't deserve any of our votes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not about the lesser of two evils anymore.  This is about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acceptable tyranny.  As in: there's no such thing as acceptable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tyranny.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I won't be voting for any tryants this year, and neither should you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It doesn't matter if they're the lesser of two tyrants.  Don't vote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for tryants.  Please.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
