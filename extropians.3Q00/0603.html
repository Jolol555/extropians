<BR>
<P>But in distinction I belive, for lack of better words... a metaphysical

or
<BR>
extra-dimensional reality, some kind of hyperspace, that is somehow

strangely effectual in this 3D world, I however do not buy into any

canned

prefabricated explanations, as it could be literally incomprehensible,

as

<P>I experience &quot;phenomena&quot;, sometimes with witnesses and corroborative

<BR>
<P><P>I thought of not responding to this, because the last time I brought up the
<BR>
S word on this list I got some pretty bad responses.  But I shall try again,
<BR>
because I sense in Robert Coyote a kindred spirit and you should know, Mr.
<BR>
Coyote, that your namesake is a mentor of mine, not in his trickster guise
<BR>
but because of his wisdom and flexibility.  Actually, since we were recently
<BR>
talking about human/animal connections, let me tell one of my favorite
<BR>
real-life stories.
<BR>
<P>Several years ago, before I moved out here to the land I now live on, I used
<BR>
to come and stay for a day or two at a time just to learn the changing of
<BR>
the seasons and so forth.  One day as I was driving up the lane I found a
<BR>
coyote who'd gotten one of her hind feet caught in the fence as she tried to
<BR>
climb through it.  I'd heard stories of animals chewing off their legs to
<BR>
get out of traps.  This coyote had not yet gone to such lengths, but she had
<BR>
struggled and pulled the ball of her leg out of its socket.  I pulled the
<BR>
truck several yards up ahead and took out a pair of tin ships so that I
<BR>
could try to cut the coyote loose.
<BR>
<P>As I approached on foot, the coyote began struggling terribly, so I talked
<BR>
to her very softly and slowly, telling her that I was going to help her and
<BR>
that I would never think of hurting her.  SHE UNDERSTOOD ME.  She had to
<BR>
have understood.  She suddenly stopped struggling, even when I stood within
<BR>
a foot of her.  She let me manipulate her leg so that I could cut the wire
<BR>
that had trapped her, and not once did she make a move to bite me, although
<BR>
it must have been painful to have her leg moved.  She just stared at me with
<BR>
her deep, golden eyes, as though there were some sort of current passing
<BR>
between us.  The moment her leg fell free, she dashed away into the
<BR>
woods--the dragging leg didn't seem to slow her much.  As she reached the
<BR>
edge of the clearing, about 15 feet away from where I stood watching, she
<BR>
turned back and looked at me with those golden eyes again, and I got the
<BR>
definite impression that she was thanking me and--I know this is stretching
<BR>
it, but I swear, it seemed to be so--inviting me to go with her if I wanted
<BR>
to.
<BR>
<P>And with this story I have to temporarily end, because I've run out of the
<BR>
time I allotted myself for playing on the internet.  However, I'll be back
<BR>
to say more about spirituality.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
