<EM>&gt; All true, but all largely beside the point of the above premise/conclusion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Either question the premise, question that the conclusion follows from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; premise, or accept the conclusion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Objection (1) is the statement &quot;will become cheap enough&quot;.
<BR>
Yes, we all know hardware will eventually get very cheap, but
<BR>
this reminds me of the problems Neil Jacobstein pointed out
<BR>
at the Foresight SA conference when people &quot;compress&quot; technology
<BR>
curves.  Everyone says &quot;this&quot; nanoweapon will be very bad
<BR>
and ignores the probability that, should parity be maintained,
<BR>
there will likely be a balanced nanodefense.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The question is *when* will the hardware and compilation become
<BR>
cheap enough?.  Will the rate of advancement of those technologies
<BR>
exceed the probable decline in augmented human labor costs?
<BR>
If not, then the argument fails.
<BR>
<P>For that to occur, corporations are going to have to see a clear
<BR>
payoff (your point), a clear path (without lots of potentially
<BR>
sticky legal or investor hurdles as Hal and I have mentioned)
<BR>
and be convinced that it is doable with an amount of money and
<BR>
in a time frame that the market environment doesn't change so
<BR>
much that they aren't better off allocating those resources to
<BR>
something else.  Iridium didn't fail on the basis of technical
<BR>
problems so much as it botched reading and playing to the market.
<BR>
All you need is the greens convincing people that &quot;services
<BR>
provided by *real* people&quot; are better&quot; and you are in a situation
<BR>
where the market demand for upload slave labor goes soft.
<BR>
<P>For both human augmentation and evoloading, you will need to develop
<BR>
technologies like fine neuron signal sensing and optical interconnects
<BR>
between the brain and the computer.  Then you need extensions of
<BR>
current software agents operating in the computer but under
<BR>
the control of the human.  For destructive copyloads you need
<BR>
fine scale molecular mapping and develop algorithms and hardware
<BR>
that hopefully let the copyload run at or faster than a human in
<BR>
real time.  These are different things and proceed along different paths.
<BR>
<P>So objection (2) is questioning the part &quot;before most individuals
<BR>
can afford to non-destructively upload themselves&quot;.  My original
<BR>
thoughts were not that we &quot;couldn't&quot; *afford* to upload ourselves,
<BR>
but that most humans would probably be more comfortable with
<BR>
a gradual evolutionary process.
<BR>
<P>If you do a copyload with pre-nanotech, you have to have a high
<BR>
confidence level you can actually make it work before human labor
<BR>
gets cheap (because living gets cheap) in a post nanotech era.
<BR>
Then you have the problem that if you want it to be really useful
<BR>
you are going to have to run it much faster than a human.  What
<BR>
good do 15,000 copies of 1 accountant do me?  You want copies that
<BR>
learn new skills *faster* than humans in a rapidly changing environment.
<BR>
The most valuable people to copy would be those that know nanoengineering
<BR>
or molecular biology or perhaps great scriptwriters (since the value
<BR>
of entertainment goes up).  If you cruise the emergency rooms and manage
<BR>
to get a couple of these, you potentially end up increasing the supply of
<BR>
this type of labor to the point where it cannot be profitable (after all
<BR>
you just make another copy right?)  Does the economy rapidly flip over to
<BR>
the point where corporations are negotiating deals like &quot;I'll trade you 4000
<BR>
physicians and 3000 scriptwriters for 400 nanoengineers&quot;?  Then once you
<BR>
have 3000 scriptwriters aren't you going to need 3000 directors?
<BR>
The economic bottlenecks that develop because your copies cannot be
<BR>
utilized effectively are going to diminish their value.
<BR>
<P>Given the paths I see the technologies on, it seems like the development
<BR>
of mednanotech for evoloading would arrive sufficiently near enough to
<BR>
the development of an understanding for brain processes and the
<BR>
compilation of efficient hardware to execute copyloads, that you cannot
<BR>
reduce the corporate risks of copyloading projects sufficiently to
<BR>
justify the expense.  That said, I suspect their *may* be people
<BR>
that have skill bases and narrow field viewpoints that they might
<BR>
be able to justify the benefits sufficiently to like-minded VC folks that
<BR>
at some point it will be attempted.  (After all, the VC folks *expect*
<BR>
most of the projects to fail).  So the question may really be one of
<BR>
whether there are enough entrepreneurs who could sell this to get
<BR>
sufficient funding to make your statement come true.
<BR>
<P>If you put $1B ov VC into copyloading while $10B is going into evoloading
<BR>
(just to pick numbers out of the air since we probably need another
<BR>
couple of volumes of Nanomedicine and pricing &amp; operating costs for
<BR>
Blue Gene before we can discuss it realistically) then I would say
<BR>
your statement is false.
<BR>
<P>Interesting to think about though.
<BR>
<P>Regarding Eliezer's comments about AI breakout -- that's what firewalls
<BR>
and encryption are for.  Unless his AI figures out how to build a
<BR>
quantum computer with more than a few dozen Qubits or someone
<BR>
stupidly gives it the controls of an unconstrained nanoassembler
<BR>
I'm not going to start to worry.
