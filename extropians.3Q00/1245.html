Yes, I believe the analogy is perfect. Unfortunately, there is much to 
<BR>
Amazing's contention that the fraudulent seem to polute any area of research 
<BR>
for a buck. The kinds of people who have been n getting my attention in this 
<BR>
regard have been medium's who &quot;remote image&quot; the deceased. A lot of what they 
<BR>
appear to do is performing a &quot;question tree inquiry&quot; where after certain 
<BR>
assumptions are made regarding the ''marks' needs, the psychic they preys 
<BR>
while he prays. Then images are spoken about, &quot; I see someone standing near 
<BR>
you...its an older gentleman...(blank stares from the Mark)....now he's 
<BR>
stepping away..its female, an older female...she's wearing  a brown 
<BR>
plaid..coat...(mark's expression changes)...she seems to have her hair in a 
<BR>
scarf..a white scarf..(Mark looks confused)....Theres a women of the same age 
<BR>
standing near this one...she's holding a cross medalion around her 
<BR>
neck..(mark is on the verge of tears)...this is where the &quot;Psychic' has to 
<BR>
tread wearilly...so as not to lose his client's gulability. Hence Psi is one 
<BR>
of the areas of study I place last, not until peer-reviewed evidence is solid 
<BR>
anyways, or at least until it appears more plausible.
