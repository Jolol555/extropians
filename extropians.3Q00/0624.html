<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;the face of rapid environmental change....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Nicely put.  Wish you had been available twenty years ago to debate the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;gurus of life extension.  This was also W. Donner Denkla's position, BTW,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but the problem was that the prior generations couldn't think very well 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;terms of &quot;systems.&quot;  They refused to see beyond the genetic driving force 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the individual survival.  Thus, they utterly rejected out-of-hand any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;arguments for the existence of a &quot;death gene,&quot; or &quot;aging clock.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You misunderstand how biologists came to the conclusion.  The effects of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;selection other than individual survival were considered carefully, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;found to be negligible compared to individual survival.
</EM><BR>
Not the impression I got.  I used to be an ALCOR member and I recall the 
<BR>
derisive comments I got for suggesting anything other than individual 
<BR>
survival could be a factor.  When I brought this up to various authorities 
<BR>
at different conferences, I got the same response.  No one ever suggested 
<BR>
that any kind of careful analysis had been done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In addition,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an &quot;aging clock&quot; is equally disadvantageous to a group; since it entails
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;direct reproductive loss (death of perfectly functional individuals)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the group is at a serious disadvantage compered to groups that don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;off perfectly serviceable individuals. &quot;Archaic&quot; gene combinations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't generally bad - in the case of stabilizing selection, genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drift, and fast fluctuating selection, they are better.  In any case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;old individuals with bad genes will be dead anyway; continued survival
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is an excellent demonstration of quality.
</EM><BR>
<P>To the contrary, it is quite conceivable that a series of environmental 
<BR>
fluctuations could wipe out a long-lived species, while a short-lived one 
<BR>
would survive.  This is not an either-or situation, obviously.  Optimum 
<BR>
lifespan for the purpose of species survival is a balance.
<BR>
<P>Let's imagine a species - of bacteria, for example - that can only reproduce 
<BR>
within a narrow temperature range, although it can survive quite well over a 
<BR>
much broader range.  Within this species, however, there are always a few 
<BR>
mutants, recessive genes, etc., for other temperature ranges scattered 
<BR>
around.
<BR>
<P>If the species is subject to wide fluctuations of temperature, relative to 
<BR>
the reproductive range, over time spans longer than the usual time between 
<BR>
dividings, then if the species is not subject to aging and has a probably 
<BR>
lifespan due to other factors that is several times that of the typical 
<BR>
duration of temperature swings that take it out of the reproductive range, 
<BR>
then there is a good likelihood that a large enough number of the 
<BR>
non-reproductive species members will be around to reduce the food supplies, 
<BR>
etc., for the minority who may have the genes necessary to keep the species 
<BR>
going.
<BR>
<P>There is always a probability that the temperature will fluctuate back to 
<BR>
the advantage of the original dominant genotype, in which case they will 
<BR>
provide a species advantage.  So the relative probabilities of different 
<BR>
fluctuation values plays into the final optimum.  However, there will be 
<BR>
times that an aging gene itself, or a genetic clock, would be to the species 
<BR>
advantage.
<BR>
<P>Often factors - such as temperature extremes - may effect young, 
<BR>
pre-reproductive age species members more than mature, physically larger, 
<BR>
more experienced members.  Imagine a troop of mountain gorillas, with an 
<BR>
alpha male who doesn't age.  His hair and massive body size give him a lot 
<BR>
of resistance to cold relative to a baby.  If this is a species that grants 
<BR>
virtual total breeding rights to the alpha male, then if there is a change 
<BR>
in climate to the colder side, so few of his babies may survive, due to lack 
<BR>
of cold adaptation, that eventually the troop itself will dwindle from 
<BR>
attrition to nothing.
<BR>
<P>In real life, the alpha male will eventually get old and feeble and be 
<BR>
replaced by the strongest available successor - likely one of the more 
<BR>
cold-adapted ones who survived babyhood.  Since semi-permanent climatic 
<BR>
changes usually take a fair amount of time - decades to centuries for ice 
<BR>
ages to come on - the turnover of alpha males favors the matching of 
<BR>
genotype to environmental need.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that, even more so, any of our ancestors over the past million 
<BR>
years would have gained a major genetic advantage thru not aging.  As we 
<BR>
have gotten smarter and stored more of our survival information in memes as 
<BR>
opposed to genes, the survival advantages of a longer life have increased 
<BR>
drastically.  Even much less intelligent species show greatly improved 
<BR>
survival competence thru experience.
<BR>
<P>When you look at really primitive peoples that most closely resemble how we 
<BR>
lived for most of the past million years - the natives of the New Hebrides 
<BR>
being the best example I have run accross - you see that the males either 
<BR>
died young from disease or being murdered for ritual canibalism or they live 
<BR>
to be a ripe old age.  Men in their 50's there still look like they just 
<BR>
stepped out of the Jack LaLane's power weight-lifting area.  If age didn't 
<BR>
kill these guys, they would likely survive well over one hundred years, and 
<BR>
the smarter ones might last a LOT longer.
<BR>
<P>Thus, no matter how maladapted the genes - virtual total lack of resistance 
<BR>
to a new plague that this particular individual survived because he had 
<BR>
lived so long that his immune system had encountered something similar - 
<BR>
cowpox, e.g. - the immortal continues to pass them on, dooming the majority 
<BR>
of his progeny, and thus his branch of the species.
<BR>
<P>At the same time, those of his progeny who were themselves immortal - or at 
<BR>
least relatively long-lived, would also dominate their local gene pools, 
<BR>
also reducing genetic turnover and making it possible for a real disaster to 
<BR>
wipe out the entire gene pool, especially if there is competition from 
<BR>
outside - e.g., Neanderthal vs. CroMagnon.
<BR>
<P>I would argue - and have argued since the '70's that it is likely that a 
<BR>
genetic clock is so essential and it is so necessary to species survival, 
<BR>
that it must be hardwired into the deep structure of the code.  It is 
<BR>
probably tied into other essential functions - as the telomeres are tied to 
<BR>
cancer resistance, so that any temporary niche advantage is more than offset 
<BR>
by immediate downside effects.  I.e., you stop aging and shortly thereafter 
<BR>
die of twenty different kinds of cancer.
