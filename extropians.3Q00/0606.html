<P><EM>&gt; Sheldrake stated that the sun could be alive.  He also said that he 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; performed a vast array of experiments which showed that birds could 
</EM><BR>
always---
<BR>
<EM>&gt; regardless of circumstances in which they were placed---determine the 
</EM><BR>
proper 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; direction of their home.  The others offered seemingly every reasonable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; challenge: well, what if you put them in a sealed box and move them?  No, 
</EM><BR>
did 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that; they still found their way.  What if you put magnets on their heads?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nope, did that.  What if you spin them around rapidly?  Nope, tried that.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if you put magnets on their heads and spin them around rapidly?  No, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that didn't work.  What if you put them in a box, put magnets on their 
</EM><BR>
heads, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and spin them around?  Nope, did that.  What if you burn down, fall over, 
</EM><BR>
and then &gt;sink into the swamp?  Nope.  It got pretty amusing.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually it's homing pigeons, and Gould only suggests magnets in the 
<BR>
manner of homing pigeons being tuned into magnetic particles, like a compass, 
<BR>
which is the common understanding of how it works....  Dyson humorously 
<BR>
points out:  &quot;the problem is, the ones who make it get the medals, while the 
<BR>
others you forget about&quot; -- and jovially laughs. 
<BR>
<P>The one who makes all the 'what ifs' and could over their heads, and looking 
<BR>
for funding for floating islands with pigeon lofts...is Sheldrake himself!! 
<BR>
You're right --  it gets funny, but mostly watching the others trying to not 
<BR>
look rude as they snicker behind their napkins ; - ) Dyson's face is 
<BR>
priceless! ..aMUSEment abounds!!!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Rupert was making his meandering points about magnets on wings, 
<BR>
anesthetization, nostrils being blocked, etc., â€¦ the others snort, snicker, 
<BR>
(Gould, Dennet, Dyson, Saks,Toulman) drink coffee, eat morsels of food and 
<BR>
look at him in disbelief, silently exchanging glances... 
<BR>
<P>My favorite thing Dennet says is in response to the sun having thoughts.
<BR>
<P><P>Sheldrake posits that the sun is CONSCIOUS. Not alive ; - ) 
<BR>
His idea is that there is a correlation between the kind of patterns of 
<BR>
mental activities and sun's electromagnetic patterns. = D . Sunspots you 
<BR>
know... The sun &quot;might be thinking&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The sun has a mind. 
<BR>
<P>Gould presents a challenge:  if Rupert can get the sun to talk to him, and at 
<BR>
that point he'll be willing to consider it. ; ) 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dennet says no no - even more, give me a REASON D'ETRE for the sun 
<BR>
&quot;might&quot; *need* consciousness  ...animals have a use for it... (Then he says 
<BR>
that evolutionary functions have a use ... for example, if trees had eyes it 
<BR>
would be a truly horrible thing, they could see attackers coming, but they've 
<BR>
no legs to run ! : ) HEHEH
<BR>
<P>Then Sheldrake speculates for a while about what the universe is thinking ... 
<BR>
maybe it's thinking about the details of evolution on earth ... sunspots ... 
<BR>
and it gets very new-agey and vague... 
<BR>
<P>I really wondered what ax the director had to grind, to put him in this 
<BR>
otherwise wonderful documentary.
<BR>
<P>I could have listened to Freeman Dyson or Oliver Saks for hours longer and 
<BR>
skipped him entirely.
