<EM>&gt; as it well might, since very few people seem to be working on

<EM>&gt; productivity today, even at a trade off for happiness today.

<P>Maybe if you recast it.  You need to have enough incoming happiness to
<BR>
be able to keep your mind on what is productive.  Happiness, like food
<BR>
and air, is a temporary sustinence that you need a constant flow of in
<BR>
sufficient quantities, or your shell reacts in a negative way.  You can
<BR>
have very very high levels of happiness at a certain point, but that is
<BR>
not the same as being happy forever.  Likewise, if you try to go with
<BR>
too low a level of happiness in search of productivity, you won't be
<BR>
able to get where you want to be.
<BR>
<P>With that as a meter, try going for that which gives you the best chance
<BR>
at longevity while maintaining adequate levels of happiness.  (This is
<BR>
not, BTW, &quot;train yourself to live while starving&quot;.  It's like fuel, too:
<BR>
focus completely on getting it, and you get nothing done, but without a
<BR>
certain level of it, you also get nothing done.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, of the career choices I can think of that are available to me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd say that the most likely to increase my survival (and, perhaps,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long term happiness,) is work in biomedical engineering; either by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing actual research or going into biomedical engineering patent law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and reinvesting much of my earnings.  Next is probably computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science/programming.  Philosophy ranks dead last.  :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Who says you can't combine them?  Use biomed to discover the truths on
<BR>
which you can base philosophies for tomorrow.  Philosophy, on its own
<BR>
with no connection to reality, is only frustrating in the end.  Or
<BR>
balance your time - amateur philosopher, professional biomedical
<BR>
engineer.
