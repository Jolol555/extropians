<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you believe birth control is wholly effective?  No?  Do you believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that human beings have a strong enough urge for sex that they very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; nearly must have sexual activity to stay sane for part of their lives?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe yes?  Then it is obvious that women cannot fully claim to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; chosen to get pregnant every time they do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No more and no less so than the male who is 'irresponsible'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bull.  Males don't have to carry babies.  They don't have to be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; careful in their partners lest one leave them pregnant or a parent with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no support.  At least not in the &quot;wild&quot;.  It is a bit different now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; days, for better or worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>The technology is there. Failure to use it is irresponsibility.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Males, in case you haven't noticed, are much more irresponsible, er
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; driven to have sex as often as possible and with less consideration of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; consequences (as a gender based generality) than females.  A male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't have to stick around to bear any consequences and it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ludricrous to claim that he generally has as much say in whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; woman decides to abort as she does.  Especially if there is no binding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; contract between them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If there is no binding contract, then it should be a two way street. The concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of equal protection applies. If the woman has the right to choose to bind the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; male into an 18 year indenturment for the support of the child, then the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; should have the same legal right to indenture the female.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Much of the time a male cannot be bound to support successfully even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there was a binding contract. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, they put deadbeat dads in jail here in NH. 9 of the top ten this year
<BR>
have been caught and have either paid up, or are rotting in jail while their
<BR>
assets are being found. Of course, the list of deadbeat moms is actually longer
<BR>
than the list of deadbeat dads, but nobody seems to want to mention that fact,
<BR>
or do anything about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No one has any honest right to indenture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone.  Except if both people agreed beforehand to produce a baby (not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a fetus) and to raise it to maturity.
</EM><BR>
<P>So then you agree that outside of a contractual agreement to reproduce (i.e.:
<BR>
marriage), a biological father should not be forced to support the child if he
<BR>
opposed the pregnancy being brought to fruition?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; All three bodies do not have equal stakes and one of those bodies is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; even a person but a fetus.  So what is it with this wierd position?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Callous my ass.  Carry around a fetal parasite within you that you never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted at the insistent of people who claim the right to pressure you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; do so and then tell me all these other people and psuedo-people have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; same right and stake.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, with the woman, its merely a matter of 9 months of discomfort and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; medical risk. With the fetus, its a matter of life and death, literally, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the male its a matter of 18 years of unconsented indenturement. Any claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the stakes for the mother are greater than the stakes for the fetus is, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its core, its own proof of selfishness and callousness. Any claim that 18 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of financial indenturement is a miniscule violation of one's rights is also its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; own proof of selfishness and callousness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Merely&quot;?  What bloody right do you have to tell any human being that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can force ver to endure one day of this much less 9 months?
</EM><BR>
<P>The same right that forces men to pay child support for 18 years for children
<BR>
they did not want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Pregnancy takes a fairly considerable toll on the body.  And it fills
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the woman with all kinds of deep emotional attachments through hormonal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes.  Evolution programs human beings for these things.  The fetus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not a human being (at least not unambiguously) so speaking of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life and death as if on the same footing with the mother is quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disingenous.  The male involved has zero rights to force the woman to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bear his child if that is not what she wants.  I don't believe in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; financial or physical indenturement of anyone.  And additional wrongs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (some of the current laws) do not make it right in any way shape or form
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet you agreed above that a woman could be forced to abort a child or waive the
<BR>
liability of the faither.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think the self-centeredness selfishness goes two ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think so, and since you don't know anything about that particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; relationship of mine, your comments are unfounded and merely ad homenim.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If all you see is self-centeredness in what was not your decision to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make and for all you know may have been pretty difficult to live with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then  that on the face of it looks a bit closed-minded to me.  I could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the time I was pretty strongly against abortion. To me, it felt like I was
<BR>
forced to be an accomplice to murder.
