<EM>&gt;&quot;preaching to the choir&quot; when I say on this list that it seems like a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing to want to make humans as perfect as possible.  But it seems like 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;virtually everywhere else, the E word is as bad as the N word.  Why is that?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think zero, that the major concern starts with &quot;who gets to decide&quot; what the perfect ideal is?  What if its the government and they decide that Perfect is Brittany Spears?  or corporations that decide that perfect is exactly the qualities they need for job performance? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the rational side, can we practice eugenics and still maintain a reasonable genetic diversity? (I think we can).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the less rational side it smacks of playing God.  Personally I think it is impossible to play God, we can however behave like rational beings.  And rational beings ought to feel comfortable in shaping their own futures, and setting the stage for their future offspring whatever form they may take.
