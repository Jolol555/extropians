<P>
I don't know about you guys, but the recent trends among Corporate
<BR>
America to strengthen Intellectual Property Laws beyond the DMCA has got
<BR>
me very concerned and agitated.  I'm all for seeing creators of
<BR>
intellectual property be compensated fairly for their work, but recent
<BR>
moves within our legal system are really starting to disturb me.  I
<BR>
think the story &quot;The Right to Read&quot; by Stallman at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/philosophy/right-to-read.html">http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/philosophy/right-to-read.html</A>
<BR>
<P>paints a very compelling reason to limit the protections of current
<BR>
intellectual property.  The intent of copyright in the first place was
<BR>
to grant the creator, for a *limited* time, a monopoly on that idea for
<BR>
personal or financial gain as an incentive to spur further creativity in
<BR>
society.  But now corporations have managed to co-opt this principle by
<BR>
extending such protections indefinitely.  Its been the principles of
<BR>
'Fair Use' that have allowed our knowledge pool to grow and evolve.  It
<BR>
has been compellingly argued that if Shakespeare were alive today, he
<BR>
would not have been able to publish the majority of his plays under
<BR>
current IP restrictions.  Regardless of any other free-market principles
<BR>
that's a pretty sobering thought.  Limiting and locking up knowledge to
<BR>
the extent that corporations are now trying to do can only mean a deeper
<BR>
poverty of knowledge and capital down the road.  As a person who
<BR>
believes in a diverse competitive free-market the current trends in
<BR>
Corporate America have really gotten me down.  Is it time for a
<BR>
reassessment?  Is capitalism the problem, or is what we have so
<BR>
perturbed by regulation that it can't truly be called capitalism?
<BR>
Either way, their is definitely a growing unrest as to what many people
<BR>
see as Corporate Power gone out of control.  The recent scuffle in
<BR>
Seattle is only the beginning of more civil unrest over the issue of
<BR>
Corporate Profits vs. Individual Liberties.
<BR>
<P>Jusr in the last year or so Microsoft's has campaigned successfully to
<BR>
change existing ownership laws and rights in 5 states to favor their
<BR>
leasing paradigm.  Is this a sign of much worse things to come?  Already
<BR>
Microsoft has taken a strong position that when you buy their software
<BR>
by saying you do not own your copy, you are only licensing the right to
<BR>
*use* it.  And along with that granted right to license this software
<BR>
you will be subject to all the stipulations of said license.
<BR>
<P>Beyond the fact that I wholehearted disagree with the ludicrous idea
<BR>
that I  can't own software I buy, ultimately Microsoft has every right
<BR>
to do with their product (I mean service) as they please.  This is all
<BR>
encompassed in their their new .NET strategy by the way.  Luckily for
<BR>
now, LINUX is defying this leasing model.  But what really bothers me
<BR>
about this is the trend of many software companies moving away from
<BR>
private ownership of software into the 'leasing a service' paradigm.
<BR>
<P>--&gt; Already Microsoft has put into some of their licensing agreements
<BR>
stipulations forbidding any user of their service from disparaging the
<BR>
company in any way.  In other words, as long as your using a Microsoft
<BR>
product (damn, I mean service) you have no freedom of speech, as you
<BR>
signed that right away when you signed up for their service.  If you
<BR>
violate this part of the license they'll yank your privileges.  It is my
<BR>
understanding that a new feature implemented in Office Suite 2000, has a
<BR>
mandatory connection to Big Brother (damn, I mean Microsoft).  If a
<BR>
connection is severed for a certain period of time your license will be
<BR>
revoked.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully big business around the world will not catch on to this nifty
<BR>
loophole in our legal system as a way of stripping everyone of their
<BR>
freedoms as a condition to use their service.  Of course you don't have
<BR>
to use their service, but if they are the only game in town (through
<BR>
sufficient merging and consolidation), your only alternative would be to
<BR>
live in the proverbial tent.
<BR>
<P>I have always tried to maintain freemarket principles, but when I see
<BR>
corporations gaining this much power over individual lives, I begin to
<BR>
doubt those beliefs and my appreciation of capitalism as usual.  Now,
<BR>
here is a scary question - is capitalism now at odds with the spirit of
<BR>
a free market, and more importantly individual liberty?  For those with
<BR>
strong reactions to this question, I am urging you to respond as
<BR>
intelligently and rationally as you can.
<BR>
<P>Paul Hughes
<BR>
<P>P.S. Lets not forget the DeCSS case as a clear cut example of how big
<BR>
business can get laws changed to successfully infringe on freedom of
<BR>
speech.
