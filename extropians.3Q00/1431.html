<P>
<EM>&gt; I define the difference between pirate and legitimate broadcasters, in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absence of intellectual property laws, to be a matter of ethics, morals,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; personal integrity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your definition of 'best at getting content to lots of people' would have
</EM><BR>
to be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; tempered by what means of obtaining and delivering that content the ethics
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the people (i.e. that of every individual you seek to deliver to) are
</EM><BR>
willing to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; accept. If the popular opinion of you is that your are a no good theif who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; steals the work of others, then a popular boycott of you is likely to
</EM><BR>
greatly
<BR>
<EM>&gt; limit the Q rating of your network, assuming of course that you can find
</EM><BR>
enough
<BR>
<EM>&gt; people to work for you.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Are you suggesting that it wouldn't be illegal to re-broadcast your content,
<BR>
but it would be unethical?
<BR>
<P>If it's unethical behavior, then why would we remove the laws governing it?
<BR>
<P>You can't have it both ways-- you want it to be free content on one hand,
<BR>
but then be able to call me thief if I use it on the other.
<BR>
<P>And if people would be tempted to call me a thief (as I suspect they would!)
<BR>
this is only further justification for my position.  Why make it legal to be
<BR>
a thief?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your inability to see through the smoke is obvious, but its the smoked
</EM><BR>
glasses
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of the shyster that is blocking your view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, look, we disagree, that much is clear.  In fact, I'd say we
<BR>
fundamentally disagree.  I'm certain we find the other short sighted,
<BR>
stubborn, naive... contentious even.  But I certainly don't attribute any
<BR>
malice or intent to decieve to your position.  But this is the second time
<BR>
in as many days that the 'opposition' has questioned my moral integrity, and
<BR>
frankly I find it kind of weird.  My intellect is on display here and you
<BR>
may attack it at will, call me stupid if you must, but I'd like to politely
<BR>
ask that we refrain from comments from the position of ethical superiority.
<BR>
I mean, it's a little early for that, isn't it?
<BR>
<P>Please and thank you.
<BR>
