<P>
Extropsensorians,
<BR>
<P>&quot;Driftin' into darkness,
<BR>
Pretty soon you'll drift away.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Folks who are inclined to mystical explanations of reality tend to take
<BR>
anything that is not yet explained--or not explained fully or with great
<BR>
confidence--by the methods of science, and attribute its features to
<BR>
mystical agencies, and to claim that it cannot now, cannot ever be
<BR>
explained by science, and that therefore science is--hurray!! we
<BR>
win--inferior to faith and mysticism.  Well, I want people to be happy.  I
<BR>
don't want to rain on anyone's parade, to deprive them of the warm feeling
<BR>
of celebratory ebullience or the pleasures of self-confidence or the sense
<BR>
of self-importance or superiority which they derive from their faith, but
<BR>
neither do I bother to spend any significant amount of time in microscopic
<BR>
analysis of their foolishness.  The discovery of scientific truth requires
<BR>
time and effort, intellectual talent, discipline, and diligence. Mysticism
<BR>
on the other hand, springs from intellectual rigidity, insipidity, and
<BR>
laziness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I assume that the reader is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;familiar with the idea of extra-sensory perception, and the meaning of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;four items of it, viz. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psycho-kinesis. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll deal with these four in a moment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;These disturbing phenomena seem to deny
</EM><BR>
<P>There is &quot;seeming&quot;, and then there is &quot;being&quot;.  &quot;Seeming&quot; is the gift of
<BR>
perception and its (sometimes noble and capable, sometimes fawning and
<BR>
inept) co-conspiritor, intellect.  &quot;Being&quot;--simply &quot;is&quot;: egoless,
<BR>
dispassionate, unconscious, and unselfconscious. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;all our usual scientific ideas.
</EM><BR>
<P>Today's usual, tomorrow's trash.  Get over it.  Or at least stop the
<BR>
incessant whining.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. 
</EM><BR>
<P>My God!, telepathy could be--no, it IS-- real?!  How shocking!  And we
<BR>
don't understand it!  How unprecedented!  We don't understand everything?!
<BR>
Oh, the pain!  How devastating to our sense of self-importance!  Oh, the
<BR>
ignominy!  We had all that twisty glassware, all that stainless steel, the
<BR>
white crisply-starched lab coats that seemed almost magically to renew
<BR>
themselves (though we knew of the agency of their renewal:  peons, a lower
<BR>
order of humanity, with servile obeisance and hushed reverence, shuffling
<BR>
through the hallowed halls in the dead of night, collecting the barely
<BR>
wilted raiment of the scientific priesthood for transport to some fetid
<BR>
cell, where, aided by an underclass of merely *industrial* (pthtoowie!)
<BR>
machines, they would perform the venal and offensive--but nonetheless
<BR>
necessary--process of cleansing and restoration), and all those nifty
<BR>
dials, guages, and flashing lights.  And then to be unmasked and degraded
<BR>
by the condemnation--the stain--of the existence something as yet unknown
<BR>
to us.  Oh, Death, please, come and take me now, life is naught but shame
<BR>
and despair.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It is very difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts
</EM><BR>
in.
<BR>
<P>Everything's hard till you know how to do it.  Do it, or accept the
<BR>
undeniable fact of your INADEQUACY!!!  And, please, stop your whining.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Once one has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in
</EM><BR>
ghosts and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;bogies. 
</EM><BR>
<P>And the tooth fairy, and the Easter bunny, and the Devil, and Santa Claus.
<BR>
The canonical premise that ignorance proves mysticism, proves something
<BR>
alright.  It proves that he who believes should not engage in a battle of
<BR>
wits with a turnip, lest the turnip prevail by the application of superior 
<BR>
strategy, to wit, prudent, parsimonious, and sagacious SILENCE!!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The idea that our bodies move simply according to the known laws of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physics, together with some others not yet discovered but somewhat similar,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be one of the first to go.
</EM><BR>
<P>Start with nonsense, and all that follows will be corrupted.  The Greeks
<BR>
had a word for it: logikos.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psycho-kinesis.
</EM><BR>
<P>(1) telepathy.  The turnip is wise.  It knows its limitations.  It will
<BR>
never offer a funky theory to explain telepathy.  It will never suffer
<BR>
embarassmnent.  It will never be proved wrong.  The turnip is a very down
<BR>
to earth fellow.  It will have no truck with mysticism.
<BR>
<P>The human organism is shot through with neural tissue, which conducts
<BR>
electrical currents.  When electrical charges are accelerated they emit
<BR>
electromagnetic radiation.  The structure which transmits is also apt to
<BR>
receive, thus the antenna which is the human body and which transmits is
<BR>
the antenna which is the human body which receives.  This may not be the
<BR>
final word regarding explanations of telepathy, but it is quite adequate to
<BR>
demonstrate my point: only the impatient and hysterical unterturnip
<BR>
intellect would despair/declare that the answer to this question is beyond
<BR>
the reach of science.
<BR>
<P>(2) clairvoyance: (definition)The supposed power to see objects or events
<BR>
that cannot be perceived by the senses.
<BR>
<P>The gross and obvious sensory capabilities are quite familiar.  Is there
<BR>
not room for more subtle--perhaps the term &quot;second order&quot; is
<BR>
apt--perceptual capabilities?  Why is this so hard?  There are radio waves,
<BR>
and infrared, and magnetic fields whizzing all about us.  Invisible
<BR>
phenomena which, despite their invisibility, are well known to us,
<BR>
manipulable, useful, and much used.
<BR>
<P>Probably those who defined and delimited that which constitutes sensory
<BR>
perception, were just limited in the depth and detail of their
<BR>
understanding.  They were new at it.  That was then, this is now.  Perhaps
<BR>
there's nothing &quot;extra&quot; about it.  Time for a revision then.
<BR>
<P>He who has his head up his ass knows only dimly lit colonic vistas. Does
<BR>
this confirm the nonexistence of more aesthetically uplifting visuals?
<BR>
Also, the tree in the forest falls without a sound.  Right.
<BR>
<P>(3) Precognition.  Doesn't the Einsteinian plasticity of space and time,
<BR>
and the as-yet-unresolved weirdness of quantum,...er,...weirdness., give us
<BR>
plenty of wiggle room here?  No need to drag out that greasy and tattered
<BR>
fudge-factor cum security blanket called mysticism.  The darkness and
<BR>
uncertainty of primevil night may have been terrifying to our wild
<BR>
progenitors.  The modern &quot;darkness&quot; and uncertainty of
<BR>
that-which-is-yet-unknown is, by contrast, our personal and sacred
<BR>
invitation to explore and discover all that lies beyond the veil of maya.
<BR>
The adventure of awakened consciousness.  That's the surprise in the
<BR>
Crackerjack box of life.  If you're reading this, you're a winner!
<BR>
<P>Alternate answer: er,... I don't know.  Did that kill me?  Nope.  In fact,
<BR>
it didn't hurt a bit.  (But then, you knew that ahead of time, didn't you?) 
<BR>
<P>(4) Tele-kenesis.  Magnets do it.  Masses do it with gravity.  Radio waves
<BR>
do it.  Action at a distance mediated by an unseen, perhaps-yet-undetected,
<BR>
but presumably material agency.  That was easy.  Next.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>We'll meet again
<BR>
Don't know where 
<BR>
Don't know when,
<BR>
But I'm sure we'll meet again some sunny day.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
