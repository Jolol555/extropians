<BR>
<P>FBI's System to Covertly Search E-Mail Raises Legal Issues, Privacy Concerns
<BR>
<P>By NEIL KING JR. and TED BRIDIS
<BR>
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is using a
<BR>
superfast system called Carnivore to covertly search e-mails for
<BR>
messages from criminal suspects.
<BR>
<P>Essentially a personal computer stuffed with specialized
<BR>
software, Carnivore represents a new twist in the federal
<BR>
government's fight to sustain its snooping powers in the Internet
<BR>
age. But in employing the system, which can scan millions of
<BR>
e-mails a second, the FBI has upset privacy advocates and some in
<BR>
the computer industry. Experts say the system opens a thicket of
<BR>
unresolved legal issues and privacy concerns.
<BR>
<P>The FBI developed the Internet wiretapping system at a special
<BR>
agency lab at Quantico, Va., and dubbed it Carnivore for its
<BR>
ability to get to &quot;the meat&quot; of what would otherwise be an
<BR>
enormous quantity of data. FBI technicians unveiled the system to
<BR>
a roomful of astonished industry specialists here two weeks ago
<BR>
in order to steer efforts to develop standardized ways of
<BR>
complying with federal wiretaps. Federal investigators say they
<BR>
have used Carnivore in fewer than 100 criminal cases since its
<BR>
launch early last year.
<BR>
<P>Word of the Carnivore system has disturbed many in the Internet
<BR>
industry because, when deployed, it must be hooked directly into
<BR>
Internet service providers' computer networks. That would give
<BR>
the government, at least theoretically, the ability to eavesdrop
<BR>
on all customers' digital communications, from e-mail to online
<BR>
banking and Web surfing.
<BR>
<P>The system also troubles some Internet service providers, who are
<BR>
loath to see outside software plugged into their systems. In many
<BR>
cases, the FBI keeps the secret Carnivore computer system in a
<BR>
locked cage on the provider's premises, with agents making daily
<BR>
visits to retrieve the data captured from the provider's network.
<BR>
But legal challenges to the use of Carnivore are few, and judges'
<BR>
rulings remain sealed because of the secretive nature of the
<BR>
investigations.
<BR>
<P>Issue briefing: Net Privacy
<BR>
<P>* * *
<BR>
<P>Internet wiretaps are conducted only under state or federal
<BR>
judicial order, and occur relatively infrequently. The huge
<BR>
majority of wiretaps continue to be the traditional telephone
<BR>
variety, though U.S. officials say the use of Internet
<BR>
eavesdropping is growing as everyone from drug dealers to
<BR>
potential terrorists begins to conduct business over the Web.
<BR>
<P>The FBI defends Carnivore as more precise than Internet wiretap
<BR>
methods used in the past. The bureau says the system allows
<BR>
investigators to tailor an intercept operation so they can pluck
<BR>
only the digital traffic of one person from among the stream of
<BR>
millions of other messages. An earlier version, aptly code-named
<BR>
Omnivore, could suck in as much as to six gigabytes of data every
<BR>
hour, but in a less discriminating fashion.
<BR>
<P>Still, critics contend that Carnivore is open to abuse.
<BR>
<P>Mark Rasch, a former federal computer-crimes prosecutor, said the
<BR>
nature of the surveillance by Carnivore raises important privacy
<BR>
questions, since it analyzes part of every snippet of data
<BR>
traffic that flows past, if only to determine whether to record
<BR>
it for police.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's the electronic equivalent of listening to everybody's phone
<BR>
calls to see if it's the phone call you should be monitoring,&quot;
<BR>
Mr. Rasch said. &quot;You develop a tremendous amount of information.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Others say the technology dramatizes how far the nation's laws
<BR>
are lagging behind the technological revolution. &quot;This is a
<BR>
clever way to use old telephone-era statutes to meet new
<BR>
challenges, but clearly there is too much latitude in the current
<BR>
law,&quot; said Stewart Baker, a lawyer specializing in
<BR>
telecommunications and Internet regulatory matters.
<BR>
<P>Robert Corn-Revere, of the Hogan &amp; Hartson law firm here,
<BR>
represented an unidentified Internet service provider in one of
<BR>
the few legal fights against Carnivore. He said his client
<BR>
worried that the FBI would have access to all the e-mail traffic
<BR>
on its system, raising dire privacy and security concerns. A
<BR>
federal magistrate ruled against the company early this year,
<BR>
leaving it no option but to allow the FBI access to its system.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is an area in desperate need of clarification from
<BR>
Congress,&quot; said Mr. Corn-Revere.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Once the software is applied to the ISP, there's no check on the
<BR>
system,&quot; said Rep. Bob Barr (R., Ga.), who sits on a House
<BR>
judiciary subcommittee for constitutional affairs. &quot;If there's
<BR>
one word I would use to describe this, it would be
<BR>
'frightening.&quot;'
<BR>
<P>Marcus Thomas, chief of the FBI's Cyber Technology Section at
<BR>
Quantico, said Carnivore represents the bureau's effort to keep
<BR>
abreast of rapid changes in Internet communications while still
<BR>
meeting the rigid demands of federal wiretapping statutes. &quot;This
<BR>
is just a very specialized sniffer,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>He also noted that criminal and civil penalties prohibit the
<BR>
bureau from placing unauthorized wiretaps, and any information
<BR>
gleaned in those types of criminal cases would be thrown out of
<BR>
court. Typical Internet wiretaps last around 45 days, after which
<BR>
the FBI removes the equipment. Mr. Thomas said the bureau usually
<BR>
has as many as 20 Carnivore systems on hand, &quot;just in case.&quot;
<BR>
<P>FBI experts acknowledge that Carnivore's monitoring can be
<BR>
stymied with computer data such as e-mail that is scrambled using
<BR>
powerful encryption technology. Those messages still can be
<BR>
captured, but law officers trying to read the contents are &quot;at
<BR>
the mercy of how well it was encrypted,&quot; Mr. Thomas said.
<BR>
<P>Most of the criminal cases where the FBI used Carnivore in the
<BR>
past 18 months focused on what the bureau calls &quot;infrastructure
<BR>
protection,&quot; or the hunt for hackers, though it also was used in
<BR>
counterterrorism and some drug-trafficking cases.

<EM>&gt; Subject: Carnivore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I saw on the boob tube tonight an MSNBC program that aired an FBI man and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reporter discussing a new software program called 'Carnivore' (meaning it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can get to the meat) that the FBI plans to activate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If this is to take effect, the software is distributed to the server on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which our email is located, then it with a general eye scans all the email
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of every client (from who, to who, subject line) , it can also be told to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; search for specific words within the body of emails, and hunt them out. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim is, that it is to locate emails about hacking and other criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activity. I think there would be some trickle down effect for corporate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest as well. Survey results exposed on the show, explains that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporations do a high level of saving 'at work emails' and 'employee's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer data' as it is. My problem with this digital wiretap, is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be 'spying' on innocent people as well and infringing on their privacy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the context at which diction is used, may be misconstrued.
</EM><BR>
