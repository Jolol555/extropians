<P><EM>&gt; perhaps even perverted - to try and have the culture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  without the beliefs.  Nowadays, I simply no longer care; religions don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have logic, they just happen.  Even so, I would still claim not to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Jewish
</EM><BR>
<P>My Russian Namesake loved to poke fun at the whole thing. Like the first 
<BR>
Spudboy comment, which was a humorous one, people WILL &quot;know&quot; by your last 
<BR>
name. 
<BR>
Which Damien points out is silly, but still it happens. Especially in (what's 
<BR>
the politically correct term for racists these days...hmm... let's see..) 
<BR>
CULTURALLY DIVERSITY CHALLENGED individuals.
<BR>
Her last name was Stein. She lived thru the first Russian civil war and 
<BR>
escaped to Paris, then New York. In New York if your name is Stein, you're 
<BR>
gonna be considered Jewish. My other friend who's name is Cohen has strange 
<BR>
ladies wlk up to her in stores,  &amp; ask her if she'd like to meet their son. ; 
<BR>
- ) ...no seriously..
<BR>
<P>Nadine Stein would often say &quot;I'm a Jew, but I'm atheist, yet Jewish means 
<BR>
religious, how can that be?&quot; and laugh. She also was extremely vocal about 
<BR>
being an atheist who celebrated Christmas, Easter, Halloween, anything. She 
<BR>
would say &quot;I love to celebrate! Any excuse to celebrate is a good thing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Note: She dies in 1987 @ 97 years, -mostly by calorie reducing/lowering 
<BR>
(though not through 'early life starvation' she was a normal weight until she 
<BR>
was 75ish, and she always ate butter and good quality meats) she just ate 
<BR>
smaller and smaller amounts as she got older - I think she would have made it 
<BR>
longer, but she was diabetic). 
<BR>
<P>She also ALWAYS used to say to me, &quot;By the time I get old enough to die they 
<BR>
will have found a cure for that&quot;. She really did believe that. That's where I 
<BR>
first heard of technology providing immortality. That's why it has never 
<BR>
seemed 'weird' or &quot;unethical&quot; to me, I'd been hearing about it since I was a 
<BR>
baby.
