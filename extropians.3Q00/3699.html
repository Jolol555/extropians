While stationed at Ashiya AB, Japan, 1956 - 1959, I took several of the base
<BR>
Special Services trips around Japan, mostly by train to sight-see many
<BR>
different things. One of them was the pen feeding operation in Kobe, Japan,
<BR>
where the famous steaks originated. The pens were extremely small, one
<BR>
animal per pen, and the cattle were fed a ground up mixture of many
<BR>
different types of food. Once the animal grew to a certain size, it was
<BR>
placed in a sling so that it's feet barely touched the ground and it was
<BR>
force fed several times a day and massaged with Sake and/or beer. The object
<BR>
of the alcoholic rubdowns was to calm the frustrated animal, which was
<BR>
highly stressed after being placed in the sling. When it came time for
<BR>
slaughter they injected Papaya juice into the animals veins so that it would
<BR>
go throughout the entire animal and help in softening and marinating the
<BR>
flesh. The Japanese didn't have the space nor facilities to breed and raise
<BR>
beef in that country, so most of the cattle came from Australia, New
<BR>
Zealand, and the U.S., when they were very young. I never had a steak
<BR>
anywhere near as good as an original Kobe steak.
<BR>
<P>Al Brashear:
<BR>
It is my understanding, from roaming the Orient since 1960, and listening to
<BR>
the locals, that Kobe beef refers to the city/area in which the process was
<BR>
started long ago, and to the way the cattle are treated. The cattle are
<BR>
imported from lots of places, Washington State for one.
<BR>
<P>The cattle are not allowed to move around too much, fattened up on whatever
<BR>
the Japanese feed them, and supposedly massaged frequently with, of all
<BR>
things, beer.
<BR>
<P>Never saw the process. Never cared to since I enjoyed the Kobe style of
<BR>
steaks.
