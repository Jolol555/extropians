From: &quot;Randy Smith&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:randysmith101@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Fear%20of%20Letting%20People%20Get%20Things%20They%20Want&In-Reply-To=&lt;00b701c0253d$8288a580$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">randysmith101@hotmail.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would choose not to give it to him. I do so because I know that if this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person (person Y) is wealthier, then that means that whatever wealth I
</EM><BR>
have,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is lessened. If Joe X wants to sell some property and I want to buy it,
</EM><BR>
then
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have if I let this person Y have the oil wealth which would otherwise
</EM><BR>
remain
<BR>
<EM>&gt; unfound, then there is more competition for the property I bidding for,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the price goes up.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Alright, let's say the amount in question is, oh, say, a thousand bucks.
<BR>
The amount of personal impact you are likely to experience from a random
<BR>
person on planet Earth receiving a thousand bucks is exceedingly low.  Hell,
<BR>
for most of us, even if -we- were to receive it ourselves, it wouldn't
<BR>
exactly be a life changing experience.
<BR>
<P>However, given the non-linear distribution of wealth on this planet, odds
<BR>
are good the money's going to go to someone for whom it -will- have a
<BR>
noticeable impact.
<BR>
<P>So if someone were to walk up to me and say, &quot;Jason, we got a thousand
<BR>
bucks, and we're gonna send it to someone randomly, yea or nay?&quot;  Me, I say,
<BR>
go for it.  What the hell?  Make someone's day.
<BR>
<P>What about a million bucks?
<BR>
<P>Well, frankly, again, I'd probably say go for it.  People win lotteries.  A
<BR>
one-time random blessing of a million bucks to some unsuspecting soul is not
<BR>
really going to make much difference to me.
<BR>
<P>A billion?
<BR>
<P>Okay, now we're talking serious cash.
<BR>
<P>There's a very slim chance that the money will fall to someone within my web
<BR>
of aquaintances and that would likely be a generally positive result.  It
<BR>
might go to someone interested in investing in me.  It might land in the
<BR>
Third World somewhere and create an instant economy-- probably good for
<BR>
planet Earth in general.  Wherever it goes, it's going to be spent.  Instant
<BR>
injection of this sort of cash is likely to cause a bit of a flutter in the
<BR>
economy, but nothing life changing.  It's worth about 15 cents to me if I
<BR>
say yes (hey, -I- might win...)
<BR>
<P>Mmm.... nah.
<BR>
<P>Too much.
