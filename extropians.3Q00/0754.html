<P>
I hadn't thought much about libido being affected by anything societal, but 
<BR>
it seems possible to me.  At least twice I heard about the experiments on the 
<BR>
men with the female pics, but never heard about anything similar done on 
<BR>
women.  You can place me in the category with the people not affected by 
<BR>
looks alone and I surely would not rate my significant other as lower in 
<BR>
attractiveness than anyone else, at least not to the point where I would be 
<BR>
affected in any way that could even be confused with something sexual.  If I 
<BR>
had a significant other, I wouldn't really give a darn what any other male 
<BR>
looked liked, especially since I don't care much what any of them look like 
<BR>
even now.  I did research on the internet for male porn pics and so far 
<BR>
haven't found any not geared to someone gay.  ( Either the pics would appeal 
<BR>
to a gay male or the pics were from or claimed to be from a gay site.)   
<BR>
Actually, it's not that easy to find free porn or any naked pics of males on 
<BR>
the internet.  I've checked on this for myself.  On the other hand, everyone 
<BR>
I know on the internet has been bombarded with pics of naked females.  For 
<BR>
those who don't have faith in the experiments I described, I think the 
<BR>
availability of female porn (as well as the lack of male porn) makes a strong 
<BR>
enough statement about males enjoying people sexually purely for looks or the 
<BR>
visual.
