<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;	There is the kicker - &quot;no competition&quot;!  In the past we had to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;compete to survive.  That is the law when there is no other more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;intelligent way to progress.  But once anyone or anything achieves the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;intelligence required to progress more intentionally than via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;survival of the fittest&quot; all the rules change drastically.  No longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are we competing, now we are communicating and sharing.  If anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anywhere grows, learns, and so on and so forth, it is better for us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;all.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you realize that you are advocating communism (or at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialism) here?  Is that the future you envision?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, good point.  I never thought of it this way.  But, no,
<BR>
that is not quite the future I envision.  I simply envision us moving
<BR>
away from survival of the fittest where everything that is not the
<BR>
fittest dies, to adoption/communication/selling of the fittest where
<BR>
everyone adopts that which is the fittest and which they most prefer.
<BR>
Once we can communicate and learn from each other, there is no need
<BR>
for the less fit to simply die.  When one company fails, everyont that
<BR>
worked for that company goes and gets a new job, they don't die.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, communism is forced cooperation, which I don't believe
<BR>
is good at all.  I believe the more we progress the more volunteer
<BR>
charity work is done.  This is true even if we are spending less of a
<BR>
percentage of our total output on charity and philanthropy, the total
<BR>
work is still growing exponential along with everything else.  You
<BR>
must admit that even in free market countries, there is ever
<BR>
increasing amount of charity work going on.  Such provides a kind of
<BR>
minimum standard to all beings which is ever growing and improving.
<BR>
Hopefully this safety net will soon cross an important threshold and
<BR>
be able to guarantee at least survival for all sentient beings.  Heck,
<BR>
I think even the Amish will be guaranteed their ability to remain
<BR>
human, live short suffering lives without technology, and so on and
<BR>
so forth for as long as they choose such, thanks to the supper
<BR>
advanced and intelligent beings very small charitable contributions
<BR>
which will make living lake that much easier than it is today?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top end, though, let the competition continue, and may
<BR>
the best be that which is eventually adopted and chosen by all the
<BR>
rest.  This isn't communism is it?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent
