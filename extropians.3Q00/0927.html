<EM>&gt;I've defended Krugman as a good economist on this

<EM>&gt;Thanks for that link, Robin. A quick skim brings up some points that look 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sound and some that look dubious. I'll have to read it thoroughly later. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since I mentioned a while back that it seemed to me that Krugman, good as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he is on many issues, does not &quot;get&quot; the New Economy, and I did not find 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time to dig up the sources of my disagreement, I will take this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opportunity to point to one link that I just came across in a pile of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stuff to read:

<P>That article just has David Henderson complaining about failed short term
<BR>
predictions of US GDP growth and oil prices.  Most economists have been
<BR>
surprised by GDP growth.  And as Damien Sullivan noted, oil prices have
<BR>
rebounded lately.  I do agree that Krugman's prediction of rising resource
<BR>
prices was the least persuasive of his six main prediction areas.  But even
<BR>
that isn't crazy - I'd give it at least a 20% chance of happening.

<EM>&gt;Krugmann seems off-base in this 1996 article. In the 4 years since it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;published the &quot;information economy&quot; has taken off, rather then taken a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beating.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...  Yet, if his people to people economy is so hot, why aren't people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leaving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;high school and leaping into these positions?
</EM><BR>
<P>He was making a 100 year forecast, not a four year forecast.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Finally Krugmann chose to ignore the impact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of technology, all technology, not just computers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, economists tend to ignore specific technologies in making predictions,
<BR>
and non-economists tend to focus on them, ignoring economic principles.
<BR>
Considering both is better, but given one or the other, I prefer the
<BR>
economists' myopia.

<EM>&gt;Krugman: &quot;...A world awash in information will be a world in which

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;per se has very little market value.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;... an increase in supply decreases price only if demand does not

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will drive up the demand for information even as its supply increases. ... I

<EM>&gt;think he needs to spell out--and defend--that assumption.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it depends on whether information is luxury or necessity.  And yes it 
<BR>
would
<BR>
be nice to hear more from him on this.  But he did outline his reasoning in
<BR>
the prior paragraphs.  (&quot;Third World families ... did not want to watch pretty
<BR>
graphics ... they wanted to live in nice houses, drive cars, and eat meat.&quot;)
<BR>
I'm not saying I'm persuaded, but his is a reasonable position to take.
<BR>
<P>As I've said, Krugman and most economists can be faulted for not understanding
<BR>
specific technologies in more detail.  But most futurists can be faulted for
<BR>
not understanding much economics.  The later sin seems much greater to me.
