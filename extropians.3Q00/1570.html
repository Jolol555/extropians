<P>Food for Thought As Carnivorous Robot Is Born
<BR>
<P>LONDON (Reuters) - Man really is in danger of being swallowed up by
<BR>
technology after U.S. scientists announced on Wednesday they had designed a
<BR>
robot that runs on meat.
<BR>
<P>Dubbed Chew Chew the ``gastrobot,'' a 12-wheeled train-like robot runs on a
<BR>
microbial fuel cell, which breaks down food with bacteria and converts it
<BR>
into electrical energy, according to a report in New Scientist magazine.
<BR>
<P>The cell works by producing enzymes that break down carbohydrates, releasing
<BR>
energy, inventor Stuart Wilkinson of the University of South Florida in
<BR>
Tampa told the magazine.
<BR>
<P>``The ideal fuel in terms of energy gain, is meat. Vegetation is not nearly
<BR>
as nutritious,'' Wilkinson said. ''Changing food into electricity isn't
<BR>
unique. What I've done is to make it small enough to fit in a robot.
<BR>
<P>Chew Chew eats sugar cubes but early applications for gastrobots may include
<BR>
lawnmowers which eat grass clippings, New Scientist said.
<BR>
<P>But Chew Chew's diet is refined compared to that of a gastrobot being
<BR>
developed at the University of the West of England -- it eats slugs.
<BR>
<P>Wilkinson is jokingly aware of the dangers of giving gastrobots a taste for
<BR>
meat: ``Otherwise they'll notice there's an awful lot of humans running
<BR>
about and try to eat them.''
