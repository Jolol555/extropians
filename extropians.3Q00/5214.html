<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;I look forward to the day when humanity is not faced with this issue.  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;that time is not too far off from now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How do you envision this abortion problem going away?  The only thing I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; imagine is universal birth control that is 100% effective.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I'm sure that is what John had in mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However even if future technology gives us this degree of reproductive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control, it will raise many new issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We talk about father's rights, but what happens when anyone can take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; microscopic samples from anywhere you've been and either create a clone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or use them to create a baby for which you are the biological parent?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Should this be illegal, that is, should society try to stop people from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing this without the consent of the donor?  (David Zindell in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Neverness series called this crime &quot;slelling&quot;.)  Celebrities could find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves being unwillingly cloned into thousands of babies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And then, there might be cases where consent is difficult to prove.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Two people have sex, and the man has arranged to be sterile, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woman wants his baby and has easy access to his DNA.  The man's efforts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to control his reproduction could easily be thwarted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These situations remind us that we are fundamentally information beings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is the nature of information to be copied, which conflicts with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas about the uniqueness of each individual.  The good thing about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these scenarios is that the babies are wanted, so presumably there will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be loving parents to raise them.
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;If I had my druthers, none of us would have to go into the future without a
<BR>
firm contract.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Your point is exactly why I've argued that each individual needs to be able to
<BR>
command ownership of their own unique genome. Given that there is a recognised
<BR>
right of procreation under natural law, it should be obvious that ownership of
<BR>
one's genome is a clause or corollary of this.
<BR>
<P>In the past I've tried to argue that this ownership should be treated under
<BR>
intellectual property concepts. Of course, I didn't think me up, my parents did,
<BR>
so technically it would be IP rights endowed to me (as a gift) by my creators
<BR>
(mom and dad) which are unalienable (I can't give it back, or away, only
<BR>
forward). Borrowing the statements of Larry Wall about Open Source vs. Napster,
<BR>
its rather obvious that there is a distinct difference between giving and
<BR>
taking, at least to anyone with any sense of moral distinction.
<BR>
<P>It used to be that such gifts were only legitimate in the context of marriage,
<BR>
which has since broken down, as the first of the major moral distinctions of our
<BR>
culture to be destroyed. Napster was not the first to contribute to this
<BR>
problem. You can blame it on King George, if you want.
<BR>
<P>Now, its pretty well recognised, as I've posted before, that when it can be
<BR>
proved that a man's sperm were forcibly removed without his knowledge, any
<BR>
resulting children cannot lay, nor can the mother lay, any claims upon him. This
<BR>
is an important precedent for the question of liability for unconsented
<BR>
reproduction of one's genome. What has not been examined is whether the offended
<BR>
party can collect damages for such a violation. Most such cases involving normal
<BR>
reproduction tend to be tossed, typically due to the state's institutional and
<BR>
historical bias for the mother.
