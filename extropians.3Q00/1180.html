</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm reporting from the SmartCard-run Sun Microsystems Net
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Terminals on the main floor of Cisco Networkers.  Just prior to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lunch I was lucky enough to attend a keynote from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;author/columnist/advisor Peter Schwartz on the subject of where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we've come and where we're going.  
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Like most &quot;visionaries&quot; the results of his visions are beyond his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life span and therefore default his responsibilities to them. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However he made some interesting points that I will categorize in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a longer e-mail later.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Never having read any of his stuff, I walk away from his speech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the feeling that he's a rich optimist -- and I don't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wonder which came first...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However I got a chance to briefly meet with him afterward and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;introduced myself in the name of my company and -- just to test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the waters -- the Extropy Institute, which brought what seemed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be a rare sort of smile to his face. 
</EM><BR>
<P>IMS Peter Schwartz is co-founder with Stewart Brand of the Global
<BR>
Business Network, an online think-tank, he is also the author of
<BR>
&quot;The Art Of The Long View&quot; which is a must read for Extropians.
