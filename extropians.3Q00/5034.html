<EM>&gt; This is true, but it's not a satisfying distinction at a time when 3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; month fetuses can be removed from the mother's womb and grown on in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incubator.  And there are other circumstances where it may be desirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have a clearer definition of human life, or a clearer concept of how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's to be dealt with.   How about when the time comes that a microscopic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; embryo can be grown to term in an artificial womb?
</EM><BR>
<P>In our present legal (and moral) system, a newborn baby cannot be killed
<BR>
even though as Barbara accurately point out it represents a far greater
<BR>
long-term drain on the mother's resources than the fetus.  However the
<BR>
reason is that there is an escape clause: anyone can give up a baby.
<BR>
No one is forced to keep a child.
<BR>
<P>Biologically, this has not been an option in the past for the fetus.
<BR>
But as Barbara suggests, with improving technology this will eventually
<BR>
change.  It will be possible to extract an unwanted fetus and raise it
<BR>
outside the mother's body.
<BR>
<P>Once that becomes possible, it might be that society will change the
<BR>
laws to treat fetuses the same as babies.  You can have an abortion any
<BR>
time you want, but you must do it non-destructively.  The unwanted fetus
<BR>
will be transfered to another womb, perhaps artificial.  In effect you
<BR>
are giving it up for adoption.  Doing abortions in the present way would
<BR>
be considered murder, and a pregnant woman failing to guard the health
<BR>
of her fetus would be child abuse.
<BR>
<P>Could this be a compromise on the abortion issue acceptable to many
<BR>
parties?
