<EM>&gt;I am thinking more and more about cryonics. The problem is that I live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Europe. Everything that I read so far seems very American. Suppose I sign up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with a cryosuspension provider in the US. Suppose I have a fatal accident on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the road after that. I do not think there would be time for an emergency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;team to come from the US. Most likely the cryosuspension would have to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;performed by a local team and the frozen corpse shipped to the storage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facility in the US, of course in proper containers and handling procedures..
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's pretty much how it's currently done. Local members/teams, 
<BR>
sometimes supplemented with non-cryo friends, family members &amp; hospital 
<BR>
staff handle the initial emergency while the professional team flies over 
<BR>
from the US asap. The patient is cooled, treated with various medications 
<BR>
(as far as this is still possible), perfused with organ-protecting fluids, 
<BR>
packed in ice
<BR>
(but not *frozen*) and shipped to the US, where the actual washout with 
<BR>
cryoprotectants and -finally- LN2 storage is done. That's the Alcor 
<BR>
procedure, anyway; CI has no professional/ volunteer teams afaik, but uses 
<BR>
a specially trained funeral directors (Barry Albin &amp; Co, based in London) 
<BR>
which use a more or less similar, though less advanced, procedure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But these technical problems might be nothing when compared to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;administrative and legal problems. Is there any cryonics provider in a EU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;country?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, there is no specifically European provider yet, but we're working on 
<BR>
it. If you're interested you can join the cryonics-euro mailing list at 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.egroups.com/group/cryonics-euro">http://www.egroups.com/group/cryonics-euro</A>
<BR>
see also the European Cryonics Page at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://homepages.go.com/~cryonic4life/europe.html">http://homepages.go.com/~cryonic4life/europe.html</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Does any major US provider have branch offices in the EU?
</EM><BR>
<P>Cryonics Institute uses the services of the beforementioned funeral 
<BR>
directors. Alcor has a facility in the UK (<A HREF="http://www.alcor.co.uk">http://www.alcor.co.uk</A>) where 
<BR>
patients are prepared for shipment to Alcor HQ in the US. Perhaps they will 
<BR>
be stored here as well in due time, though the building wouldn't exactly be 
<BR>
ideal for this sort of thing; better have something like an old bunker. 
<BR>
Better protection against accidents and vandalism. Probably better 
<BR>
insulation possibilities too, and it looks wicked cool.
