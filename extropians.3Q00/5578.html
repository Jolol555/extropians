<EM>&gt;  Striving for excellence is excellent. Where's the room for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  spirituality/mysticism/religosity? Why do we need it? Does it benefit us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; add it? What price do we pay?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>Laziness is a lot of it. If you pretend to be spiritual instead of actually 
<BR>
doing the spiritual work, you don;t have to really *be* spiritual.
<BR>
<P>Good questions. Three separate terms you have blended into one.  There's a 
<BR>
subtlety at play... 
<BR>
<P>Oh... and you forgot one nasty attribute: Superstition.
<BR>
<P>Spirituality is not really a form of mysticism. Many people *claim* to be 
<BR>
spiritual, New Agers for example, but all they are is superstitious, rigid, 
<BR>
lazy or self delusional. George Dubya thinks he is spiritual, but he is 
<BR>
really just a born again former alcoholic. = ) He'd like to tell me what I 
<BR>
need to do to get into heaven.... 
<BR>
<P>Spiritual (to me) is a discipline of disciplines: a meta-discipline, if you 
<BR>
will... and is needed to master Zen, Music, Taoism, Karate, Sports, Yoga, 
<BR>
relationships, the Arts - and for me - automorphing. 
<BR>
<P>It requires emotional fine tuning and great focus - combined with a physical 
<BR>
state of well being and a beneficent intent.. it can be as simple as 'do unto 
<BR>
others as you would have done unto you' ..or a daily practice requiring 
<BR>
centering and biofeedback.
<BR>
<P>Mysticism and Religion are a different fish, and are more likely to be linked 
<BR>
to irrational behavior. Why they are so necessary and important to our world 
<BR>
is a very important part of the puzzle of humanity and one which we could 
<BR>
benefit by exploring without so much scorn and judgementalism. Acceptance of 
<BR>
it is key, if we want to make changes. Make love not war upon it.
<BR>
<P>Spirituality is an honoring of a part of our mind or our life source, but 
<BR>
which doesn't need to be a superstitious belief system.  
<BR>
<P>Superstition, pretend gods, and false belief systems are dangerous - yet they 
<BR>
are also useful.
<BR>
Useful to whom?
<BR>
Self delusion, judgementalism of others and propping up of self importance 
<BR>
seem to play a large role in organized religion. Historically it helps in 
<BR>
motivation &amp; manipulation of masses. 
<BR>
<P>Today we have substituted TV.
