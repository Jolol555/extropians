One minute the Waco gunshot issue seemed resolved, the next...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following webpage contains compelling evidence
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of gunfire either at or from Mt Carmel during the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 19, 1993 fire, which I've just discovered on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tape known as the &quot;FBI SWAT-team videotape.&quot; I've
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided a sound file so that you can hear and judge
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this evidence for yourself. This tape was recorded
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from sniper nest Sierra-3, about 100 yards from Mt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmel. First you'll hear the apparent crack of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a gunshot followed by one or two people that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;GOOD SHOT&quot; then &quot;GOOD SHOT&quot; again:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm">http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.wav">http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.wav</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that you hear a voice that comes in over a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;police-type radio at the sniper's nest that says:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have rounds cooking off or shots being fired.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That speaker is apparently at another location.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please download and save that sound file. There
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a lot of background noise, so listen closely,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you'll want to listen to it several times.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often experience distortions on first runs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this clip while hearing it via my browser,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so be sure to listen to it more than once.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Brief Overview of The Evidence Presented Above
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most dedicated Waco researcher I've ever
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known was Richard Sanford, a retired nuclear physicist
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fellow founding member of the Committee for Waco
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice (CWJ). [*] It was a great loss to us all when
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard died of a sudden heart attack last week, on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 25th. Richard's fiancee donated to the CWJ all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Richard's Waco files including the FBI SWAT-team
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video examined at the webpage above, which Richard
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acquired a few years ago from attorney Linda Thompson,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who acquired it from the government in a FOIA release.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FBI SWAT-team video was made by an agent who brought
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own camcorder to the Waco scene and from sniper nest
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sierra-3 he taped the Mount Carmel Center as it burned.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I viewed the full tape a few days ago for the first
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time, while the fire is seen burning I heard what sounds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the sharp crack of a gunshot followed by one or two
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people that say &quot;good shot&quot; and then &quot;good shot&quot; again,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second time even louder and clearer than the first.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! Here we have a tape from a known sniper nest and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the background we hear what clearly appears to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a gunshot followed by people saying &quot;Good shot.&quot; The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easiest explanation is also the most disturbing.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A range of possible explanations are explored:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm">http://users.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other apparent gunshots heard a few moments
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the shot discussed above, and those shots were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presented in Linda Thompson's video &quot;Waco II: The Big
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie Continues,&quot; and they can be heard at this website:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/1543/f_agents/shooter.htm">http://geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/System/1543/f_agents/shooter.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About those gunshots, Linda Thompson says: &quot;Listen to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the FBI SWAT-team tape as the fire burns. Shots can be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard from nearby and echoing off the house. That means
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shots were being fired at the house, not from the house.&quot;
