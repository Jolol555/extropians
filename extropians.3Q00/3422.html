<EM>&gt;     I have already given Max the info. The Loz-feliz library has a policy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that anyone using their public workstations must provide ID (library card or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers licence). Their personal details are logged. Users can only have 30 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minute sessions and the time is recorded against the user. so jamiro is as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good as found. That is if the library has been following policy. ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily.  If the machine is hackable, someone else sitting at
<BR>
home anywhere in the world could have possibly hacked a connection to
<BR>
the computer in the public library and caused it to initiate the
<BR>
outbound SMTP connection which sent the message.  Additionally,
<BR>
someone could have spoofed the IP address of the computer in the
<BR>
library.  IP spoofing is not that hard.  While none of these are
<BR>
likely contingencies, they cannot be ruled out.
<BR>
<P>The bottom line is, as this lists' users ought to know from our
<BR>
discussions of cryptography for security and authentication, if you
<BR>
want true authentication you must *use digital signatures* with a
<BR>
well-known signed key.  If a message arrives without a digital
<BR>
signature you can have absolutely no assurance that it comes whence it
<BR>
appears to come.
<BR>
<P>Everything else is like an unsigned typed postcard -- there's no
<BR>
privacy and no authentication.  Meanwhile I do hope the malefactor is
<BR>
found and forced to pay the penalty for libel.  But I agree with Spike
<BR>
that we can expect more and more garbage on mailing lists and
<BR>
websites; perhaps we may even see counter-intelligence type posts in
<BR>
which people with a grudge post calumnies while masquerading as
<BR>
well-known members of the list.  It is feasible that this could be
<BR>
done with software to aid in mimicking the vocabulary and
<BR>
Markov-chains of word sequences that characterize that poster's style,
<BR>
not to mention using IP spoofing, hacked accounts, etc.
<BR>
<P>To be sure that mail *really* comes from whom it claims, a digital
<BR>
signature guarded by a strong passphrase is required.  Fortunately, I
<BR>
believe this list's readers to be intelligent enough to discriminate
<BR>
among information sources and learn to expect and adopt authentication
<BR>
for important communications.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
