WANT WANT WANT WANT
<BR>
<P>Fantastic find Hal. The cutting edge of robotic teleoperation.
<BR>
<P>It's actually cheaper than I thought it would be ($US5K).
<BR>
<P>Very cool; a wireless webserver on wheels, so you can control it through a
<BR>
web front end. Although I'm sure thats a bastard to use; I don't know why
<BR>
they didn't build special purpose client software for it; you'd think that
<BR>
would have to be better for the user.
<BR>
<P>It really should have a speaker and microphone; it seems pretty useless
<BR>
without those, and hey, after giving it a camera on a neck, how easy would
<BR>
audio have been?
<BR>
<P>Do you think if you used this thing routinely for work, that anyone could
<BR>
take you seriously? It would be like working with K-9 from Doctor Who.
<BR>
<P>I hope we see more of this kind of thing.
<BR>

<P><P><EM>&gt; Nick writes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm planning to talk about virtual reality: how teleworking may become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; popular when VR gets good enough that you can get those social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interactions with office mates that seem to be so essential. When that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stage is reached (I'm reckon this could implemented on a large scale in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about fifteen years) then there seems to be no reason why anybody who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; works only with information would need to be physically present in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; office. Life guards on beaches etc. are a different matter, since it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doubtful that robots will be good enough and cheap enough to replace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manual labour within that time scale.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We had an interesting thread here a few days ago about using tele-operated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robots for vacation or business purposes.  Combining your VR at work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea suggests wheeled robots roaming the halls, a monitor on the front
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with your smiling face in place, camera mounted so that it can interact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with people and it's just like being there.  You could go to meetings,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the table would have some chairs and some spaces for the wheeled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; robots to roll up to.  Maybe you could even put an arm on the robot and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it could carry a coffee cup or shake hands with important clients.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See <A HREF="http://www.irobot.com">http://www.irobot.com</A> for something that could evolve into this.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got the wheels, it's got the camera (with a wireless webcam interface).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just add a monitor or at least a speaker so you can talk through it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (you could paste your picture on the front) and you're all set.  Maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just a cell phone with a speaker phone attachment?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I might even get one and try to get the office up in SJ to let it wander
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around.  The biggest problem would be getting the IS department to open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up the corporate firewall for the webcam.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
