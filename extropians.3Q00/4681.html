<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; One problem with such databases is the liability of the distributor if
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the information is challenged.  I'm not sure how the BBB gets around that.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Maybe the inaccessibility of the information helps them to keep a low
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; profile.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Forthcoming anonymous publishing systems (Freenet, Mojonation et al.)
<BR>
can make maintainer of such a database immune from prosecution. The
<BR>
publishers of the individual records can choose to remain anonymous or
<BR>
reveal their identity (by signing their record with their public
<BR>
digital signature).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; The cypherpunks talk about data havens, offshore or crypto-hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; databases which could record and disseminate information without being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; bound by legal regulations.  They would hold this kind of reputation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; information and make it available for a fee.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I'm not sure the fee is necessary. Unless you build an (not
<BR>
necessarily linked to realspace identity, in fact that might be quite
<BR>
a bad idea) authority as maintainer of a database, and want to cover
<BR>
your operation costs that way.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Such systems would have the advantage of making more information available
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; which would help people to make better decisions.  On the other hand
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; there would be problems with inaccurate information, plus people who
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; had bad reputations would have a harder time walking away from them.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Current credit databases are required to purge data after a certain
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; number of years, but presumably an unregulated data haven would happily
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; inform a creditor of your bad debts from decades past.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
If you allow anonymous negative submission, you allow slander (a DoS
<BR>
on a reputation, e.g. Quaker bashing Nestle). If you only allow
<BR>
authenticated negative submissions, you expose critics to potential
<BR>
legal prosecution (&quot;I (John Doe) bought a box of cereal from Nestle,
<BR>
and it sucked&quot;), since a past transaction in real space can be matched
<BR>
to to an alternative identity. If you allow anonymous positive
<BR>
submission, and creation of anonymous identities is cheap, a bad apple
<BR>
might create quite a few of alter egos, and brush up his reputation
<BR>
undeservedly (Nestle's tentacles saying only nice things about
<BR>
Nestle).
<BR>
<P>Otoh, if you allow only positive nonanonymous submissions (subjective
<BR>
evaluations of transaction of A with B digitally signed by one or both
<BR>
of the parties), it is not obvious what the incentive to sue would be
<BR>
(of course, in the current topsy-turvy legal world, those without a
<BR>
recorded positive accomplishment/interaction track might successfully
<BR>
sue the maintainer of the database, or anybody who is saying something
<BR>
positive about their peers but not them in the name of &quot;maintaining
<BR>
equal chances&quot; or somesuch rubbish -- there's nothing to be done about
<BR>
a corrupt system apart from fleeing its area of influence).
<BR>
<P>Of course then a homo novus would have a much harsher time, having no
<BR>
reputation track (or even a worse than neutral track, by all the bad
<BR>
apples maquerading as newcomers), but this only reflects already
<BR>
existing situation.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Without meaning to seem pitiless or tough, it is arguably valuable
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for all parties in a proposed transaction to know the history of their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; counterparts, and then to decide for themselves how much to discount or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ignore past misbehavior.  In the present system, Big Brother in effect
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed. You can always create a new identity, and start from scratch,
<BR>
leaving bad mana behind. Of course, exactly such behaviour will drag
<BR>
new players' ratings down, but hey, it's a tough old world.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; lays down the laws of mercy, saying, thou shalt forgive everything that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; happened more than X years ago (and to make sure, we'll prevent you from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; knowing about it).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this is a quite rotten attitude. I hope Mojonation &amp; Co will
<BR>
fix that.
