<EM>&gt;  They said they had the right to come onto my land without a search warrant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they had probable cause to think that illegal activities were going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on here due to the Vitex trees, which, as I said, they mistook for marijuana
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plants. The way I viewed it at the time was that I wouldn't get far by suing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them--others had tried it and failed to get anywhere.  I hadn't suffered any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real damages--in fact, they helped me out by cutting back a root that was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blocking a gate.  I don't know, though. It's still something that bothers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me.  I remember once seeing a man being taken into the federal courthouse in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handcuffs and thinking, &quot;Oh, there's a criminal, a bad guy,&quot; and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suddenly realizing that odds were he wasn't a bad guy at all, that he'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably done something I wouldn't consider a crime at all. That, in fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bad guys were the ones wearing the guns and driving the car.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I have had some experiences with these goons (different agencies though)
<BR>
and know others who have as well.  The experience is very unsettling for
<BR>
most people because it doesn't mesh well with their perceptions of
<BR>
reality.  The sad part is that it happens more often than people realize,
<BR>
and a significant fraction of the people it happens to are innocent.  I
<BR>
have a few comments about what to do in these situations:
<BR>
<P>1)  Know and understand the limits of their authority.  Most of these
<BR>
agencies have very little authority beyond that which you give them.  They
<BR>
will try to trick, cajole, harass, and threaten you into giving them the
<BR>
permission they need.  95% of the time, they can do what they do because
<BR>
people roll over and let them.  
<BR>
<P>2)  Just say no.  Never give them permission to do *anything*.  If they
<BR>
ask for permission, it means that they do not have the authority to do
<BR>
what they are asking.  Giving them permission is asking for trouble.  If
<BR>
they have a search warrant, restrict their activities to the letter of the
<BR>
search warrant.
<BR>
<P>3)  Volunteer as little information as possible.  Keep your communication
<BR>
extremely brief, or even better, just act confused (e.g. as though you
<BR>
don't even speak the language).  Answering &quot;I don't understand&quot; to every
<BR>
question (regardless of what it is) has been very effective for people I
<BR>
know when dealing with thuggish three-letter agencies.  They get
<BR>
frustrated and leave, especially if they are &quot;fishing&quot;.  If they want to
<BR>
talk, have them talk to your lawyer.
<BR>
<P>4)  Guns won't help you most of the time; these guys have a well deserved
<BR>
reputation for being a bit trigger happy, and they always bringing
<BR>
overwhelming force.  While the courts have upheld your right to shoot
<BR>
these guys in many cases, being legally justified is a small consolation
<BR>
when you are dead.
<BR>
<P>5)  Have a good lawyer.  These guys will often attempt to pull some very
<BR>
marginal stuff, and frequently trample on the 4th Amendment.  Make sure
<BR>
they know you have a pack of attack lawyers looking to tear them a new
<BR>
asshole, and it is always helpful to look like you have the money to back
<BR>
it up.  When lawyers show up and call their offices, they usually leave
<BR>
you alone real quick.  This always puts a damper on their ardor.  While it
<BR>
is difficult to sue these guys for anything useful, you can blackmail them
<BR>
into leaving you alone.
<BR>
<P>6)  Require that the county Sheriff be present when they conduct their
<BR>
business.  In fact, call the Sheriff as soon as you see them (&quot;guys in
<BR>
black carrying guns outside my house&quot;).  This will help keep you from
<BR>
&quot;accidentally&quot; getting killed and they will behave much nicer too.  In
<BR>
many jurisdictions it is illegal for federal agents to affect any kind
<BR>
business without clearing it with the Sheriff first, and in many cases
<BR>
someone from the Sheriff's office is supposed to be present.  If they
<BR>
overlook this requirement (and they frequently do), the Sheriff can
<BR>
force them to leave the county and/or imprison them.  Sheriffs have
<BR>
enormous power and among them is the ability to protect you from federal
<BR>
goons.  Most will do this part of their job, particularly if their
<BR>
authority has been stepped on.
<BR>
<P><P>Damn, that was a good bit longer than I anticipated.  Anyway, these are
<BR>
some general guidelines about what to do if (when?) goons land on your
<BR>
doorstep.  At the very least, this will help keep them at bay and help keep
<BR>
you safe for the most part.  It will also minimize the amount of stuff
<BR>
they can get their sticky hands on (they have an infamous tendency to take
<BR>
things and never return them whether you've commited a crime or not).
