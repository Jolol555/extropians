This sounds hauntingly familiar.

<A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html</A>

<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
Routers look at every
<BR>
packet, determine what type of packet it is, where it is coming from and where
<BR>
it is
<BR>
going to, then the router delivers the packet to its intended destination. This
<BR>
is what
<BR>
routers do. Adding the Carnivore task is a simple matter of blind copying every
<BR>
packet
<BR>
to or from a bad guy to a third address at the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building in
<BR>
Washington, DC. It's at most a few lines of code and requires no additional
<BR>
hardware. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;So why the box? 
<BR>
<P>The probable reason is because cops like to be in control. They LIKE boxes, like
<BR>
delivering them in unmarked cars, like the satisfying click of the RJ-45
<BR>
connector as it
<BR>
&nbsp;slides home.
<BR>
...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;....But I have my own theory about Carnivore. From a network 
<BR>
architecture standpoint, the best location for Carnivore is right 
<BR>
after the ISP's router. This puts Carnivore in the path of every 
<BR>
packet entering or leaving the ISP. It's also a major reason why 
<BR>
ISPs might not want to install Carnivore boxes -- it's the network's 
<BR>
point of greatest vulnerability. In this position, Carnivore can 
<BR>
act as a listening and recording device, OR IT CAN ACT AS A SWITCH. 
<BR>
If we ever hear a proposal from the FBI in which it plans to install 
<BR>
Carnivores at all 6000 ISPs in the U.S., we'll be giving the government 
<BR>
the power to do something it can't do right now. 
<BR>
<P>Shut the Internet down. 
<BR>
<P>======
<BR>
<P>Again, I think the purpose is to filter content in wartime or other 
<BR>
national emergency, real or concocted. A standardized box that a
<BR>
military training school tech can service fits this theory.
<BR>
<P>Truth is the first casualty in war.
