&nbsp;A well-regulated militia was intended to protect the powers of the states
<BR>
against federal usurpation (which is why states were supposed to be their
<BR>
regulators); this was also the reason for the 10th amendment (that all powers
<BR>
not specifically granted to the federal government should devolve to the
<BR>
states).  However, the Civil War proved that states could not exercise a right
<BR>
to secede from the Union, and the state National Guards keep their weapons in
<BR>
armories, unlike the militias, which depended upon the citizen-soldiers to
<BR>
furnish their own.
<BR>
<P>I reply:
<BR>
The Civil War was, in fact, a rather extra-constitutional action. It has never
<BR>
been legitimately justified under the Constitution. I would be rather curious if
<BR>
southern states filed a class action suit against the federal goverment for
<BR>
violation of their rights at the time of the civil war, demanding the right to
<BR>
secede, what would result.
<BR>
<P>I am glad, Joe, that you do recognise the difference between the National Guard
<BR>
(which, being nationalized, is no longer a militia formed of the enfranchised
<BR>
members of a community) and the militia. While Title X of the US code does
<BR>
define the difference between the organized and unorganized militia, it does not
<BR>
deal with the issue of National Guard units that are not under the direct
<BR>
command of state Governors, but under the US Army, and which act as little more
<BR>
than Army reserve units. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Something well over 50 million state-sponsored deaths in various regions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;occured during the 20th Century as the direct result of gun control,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;often within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a few years after a general confiscation. This 'experiment' has been run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;times to form a postulate:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Guns don't kill people, despotic governments do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Joe says:
<BR>
But gun control was not practiced by those governments - citizen disarmament
<BR>
was.  There should be no argument that while sane and law-abiding citizens
<BR>
should have the right to keep and bear, that the means to commit quick and easy
<BR>
long-range mass murder should be, as much as possible, kept out of the hands of
<BR>
kids, criminals and psychos, who cannot discharge the resposibilities
<BR>
concomittant with such rights in a responsible manner.  Certainly they should
<BR>
not be able to simply walk into a Wal-Mart and legally purchase such killing
<BR>
tools at a moment's notice.  This is the type of gun control that I, and all
<BR>
reasonable people, support.
<BR>
<P>I say:
<BR>
Prior to the First Drug War (i.e. prohibition), machine guns, silencers,
<BR>
howitzers, tanks, fighter planes, submarines, armed merchantmen, and bombers
<BR>
were owned by private citizens to no ill effect. The first practical armed
<BR>
submarine, built by a chap named Holland, were private vessels, which he
<BR>
developed as a result of financing by Finian rebels in his homeland of Ireland.
<BR>
His subs were armed with pneumatic steam cannon that could launch rather large
<BR>
artillery shells a couple thousand yards. Only his most developed version was
<BR>
ever sold to the US military (commissioned as the 'Holland'), which was its
<BR>
first sub.
<BR>
<P>John Moses Browning's automatic rifles and machine guns could be bought in any
<BR>
hardware store, and Browning silencers could likewise be bought, for the purpose
<BR>
not of assasinating people, but to allow neighbors to practice with their
<BR>
firearms in the backyards or basements without disturbing other members of the
<BR>
household, farm animals, or neighbors.
<BR>
<P>It was only when the First Drug War heated up in Chicago that guerrilla armies
<BR>
fighting for the individual's right to imbibe resorted to the use of automatic
<BR>
weapons.
<BR>
<P>In Nazi Germany, contrary to Joe's claims, there was not citizen disarmament.
<BR>
There was non-citizen disarmament (Jews were stripped of citizenship), then
<BR>
there was restrictions on WHICH citizens could own guns (only those with
<BR>
demonstrated loyalty by their membership in various state or Nazi
<BR>
organizations). Trying to claim that confiscation is not 'gun control' is a
<BR>
bogus argument, because when the government has confiscated the citizens guns,
<BR>
it sure has control of them, now, doesn't it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;The issues we face today, difficult as they are to deal with, are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;a taste of the problems ahead.  We need to identify sound philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;principles which can guide our decisions on these matters, in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;chart a consistent course through the issues we will soon be dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;See above, also Federalist papers, other writings of Jefferson, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I hope this is quite clear.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As I expect my points are.
</EM><BR>
<P>No they aren't Joe, they are disengenuous.
