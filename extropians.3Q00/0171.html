<EM>&gt; &gt;As part of my critical thinking class, I cover critical thinking

<EM>&gt; &gt;about investing and personal finance. I always ask how many of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;students have covered any of this before. Usually not one person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;raises their hand. They seem to find that particular topic the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;engaging one of all. I'm always stunned to find that financial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;planning, basic logic, and evolutionary theory, are almost never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;taught in schools, at least based on the many hundreds of students I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have surveyed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have had the same experience.  There are certain core subjects that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think should be taught to everyone, but aren't.  What would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list of these subjects.  I think we could agree on the common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requirements, Reading, Writing, Arithmatic, Science, History.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Literature, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The missing ones would probably include:  Human Nutrition, Personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Finance, Comparative Political Systems, Comparative Economics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Self-Defense, Scientific Method, Logic, Philosophy, Art....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>The problem here, which I haven't seen mentioned is that most of these
<BR>
latter things are expected to be taught to people by their families
<BR>
as they grow up. The fact that we have to now consider moving them
<BR>
into schooling shows just how bad our &quot;home education&quot; system has
<BR>
gotten in many cases. If you do try to move many of these subjects
<BR>
into schools you are going to have a real debate on your hands as to
<BR>
&quot;what is the best diet?&quot;, &quot;what are the best economic theories?&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;what is the best philosophy?&quot;.. you see where I am going. There would
<BR>
be a huge flamewar in every school district. If the schools were
<BR>
private though, it might work since each school could specialize in
<BR>
a certain way of looking at the world and teach/brainwash that to 
<BR>
their students. Of course this viewpoint would be exactly the same as
<BR>
the parents who are paying the fees- essentially getting the same effect
<BR>
I think as if these subjects had simply been taught at home as they
<BR>
are now. Am I cynical?
<BR>
<P>I think the most important underlying point is: just because a lot of
<BR>
people happen to live in the USA doesn't mean they are well suited to
<BR>
it. As has been noted, some people are in fact not even able to deal
<BR>
with it. And some people like many on this list find it too restricting.
<BR>
The education system is not going to totally fix this even if you were
<BR>
able to agree on (good luck) a social contract curriculum. It's a deeper
<BR>
problem I think- a one size fits all government applied to a bell curve
<BR>
of people and lifestyles.
