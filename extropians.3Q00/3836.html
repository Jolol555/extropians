<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   There is no point in talking about my work towards my dreams. It would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dismissed as mystical rubbish by the masses here. The reason that I never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joined ExI years ago still stands and that is the dogmatic embrace of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atheism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the ridicule of any sense of spirituality in others by its members.
</EM><BR>
<P>Masses? Yikes... whodat? ...me... ? 
<BR>
<P>Not every member here is against spiritual people. While I don't believe in 
<BR>
angels or the tooth fairy, I look after my spiritual side -- quietly, calmly 
<BR>
and without need of approval by anyone here. I understand why a religious 
<BR>
person could feel ganged up on here, but you are making a generalization 
<BR>
about  this consituency that is harmful and not entirely true.
<BR>
<P>Spirituality is meaningful to *me* - but we can have our own definitions of 
<BR>
what that means. That doesn't mean there's a magical force of some kind that 
<BR>
listens to my prayers or that I believe in life after death if I am just good 
<BR>
enough to qualify. It also doesn't mean I believe that a giant turtle is 
<BR>
carrying the earth on it's back! It means I take care to listen to the inner 
<BR>
voice that guides me, and to keep open loving thoughts and people around me, 
<BR>
do yoga, burn sage, sing rituals -- and find ways to balance and center me in 
<BR>
this crazy world. I am not afraid these rough natured atheist grumps will 
<BR>
ridicule or dismiss me!
<BR>
<P>boo hoo
<BR>
<P><P>True spirituality is unlike YOUR brand of it, whatever that is, it doesn't 
<BR>
require atheists to censor their own dislike of 'spiritual people'.  In fact 
<BR>
I welcome scepticism, ITS NOT DOGMA - and it keeps me above board and honest! 
<BR>
If I'm foolin' myself, I wanna know!
<BR>
<P>Likewise, is not a threat to me if Mystic Bob KNOWs that turtle is there! 
<BR>
<P>Who cares if my rituals for self improvement are total crap! Feels good, I 
<BR>
dig it, it's all in the *intent*  - hey, I paint a hell of a lot better when 
<BR>
I do it... 
<BR>
<P>PS: Besides the mostly atheist crowd, there are pagans here, Mormons, 
<BR>
&quot;uncertain deists&quot;, Jews, Buddhists, Wicca, you name it. Probably some things 
<BR>
that are just made up for fun! Computerotimists!
<BR>
Life should be fun.
<BR>
<P>Take a chill pill, cool yer jets and stop making generalizations.  And one 
<BR>
more question: are you picking on Eliezer?
<BR>
<P>What began all this was one very intelligent poster who expressed his 
<BR>
commonly shared skeptics view of debunkery. 
<BR>
<P>Here's a spiritual exercise : ) 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Look in the mirror and repeat: It all begins with ME, it all begins with 
<BR>
me...
