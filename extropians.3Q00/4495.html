<EM>&gt; Won't it be great when we can make undesirable things like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper work (or anything else we'd like to do but now hate doing) be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orgasmick or better?  ;) Now that'll be true freedom!  Imagine how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much we'll all get done with such abilities to want what we want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want, and not what our creator hard wired us to want!
</EM><BR>
<P>But our decisions to make these changes aren't &quot;really&quot; free.  That is,
<BR>
if freedom is the ability to change our wants and desires, we can't be
<BR>
free by that definition, because only pre-existing wants and desires can
<BR>
motivate us to make these changes.
<BR>
<P>So you want to make paper work be orgasmic?  This isn't freedom, it is
<BR>
merely one built-in goal being given more priority.
<BR>
<P>It was pointed out earlier that one way to think about this goal-meddling
<BR>
is in the context of Minsky's &quot;society of mind&quot; model.  In this model,
<BR>
our minds are composed of multiple agents, cooperating and competing.
<BR>
Each has its own skills and abilities, but also its own desires and
<BR>
agenda.  The reason we have conflicting goals and desires is because of
<BR>
the multiplicity of agents.  In some circumstances one has the upper hand,
<BR>
and in other situations another does.
<BR>
<P>Changing goals then would be a matter of one agent momentarily being
<BR>
dominant and being able to &quot;lock in&quot; its dominance.
<BR>
<P>Pragmatically, this may not be that great an idea, as presumably there
<BR>
is some evolutionary reason for having this degree of mental diversity
<BR>
which we experience as indecision and frustration.  However we can perhaps
<BR>
argue that modern conditions are sufficiently different from those under
<BR>
which we evolved that we can justify giving some agents more power.
<BR>
Still, looking at Brent's example, making paperwork that much fun may
<BR>
seem like a good idea at the time, but we can easily imagine situations
<BR>
where such Sphexlike behavior would turn out to be a mistake.
<BR>
<P>Philosophically, it hardly seems an advancement of freedom for one of your
<BR>
subparts to become dominant over the others (except from that part's point
<BR>
of view, I suppose).  Rather, it is a change of mental architecture which
<BR>
will be beneficial in some circumstances and arguably harmful in others.
<BR>
<P>The interesting question is whether AIs will be designed with a similar
<BR>
mental organization.  Will they be beset by the inconsistencies and
<BR>
contradictions of our human minds with all their parts?  Apparently it
<BR>
was the best evolution could do.  Can we do better?
