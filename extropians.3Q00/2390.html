</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;After the fixed costs, reproducing software is basically a costless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I see those as obvious statements.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes but the fixed price in music is very high for an individual without hope
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of  making money back.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>There has been and always will be garage bands, as long as there are garages.
<BR>
There is an untold number of semi-professional musicians scattered throughout
<BR>
the world.
<BR>
<P>The industry itself produces in a very blatant manner those acts which it
<BR>
promotes the most, and which provide it the most money.  I'm not saying that
<BR>
there are contrived bands, but there are contrived bands.
<BR>
<P>In different people's opinions, there are better and worse bands and musicians.
<BR>
<P>The fixed price of distributing records in music stores is very high, perhaps
<BR>
uncompetitively so.
<BR>
<P>By the same token, there are thousands and thousands of labels.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Linux or the other free UNIXs were not free, they are made from thousands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thousands of programmer hours and precursor code, they were just freely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They were freely shared. That is different. You share and you get something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back because of the GNU license. Thus everybody gets a better tool to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Music is (usually) neither freely given nor shared. A musician who's music
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is copied does not get anything back from the comunity. He might himself get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free music, but that doesn't buy him bread. It's sort of a reverse &quot;Tragedy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the commons&quot;. He looses and socity wins. In the short term at least, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he would quickly stop producing music.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Some actually do share their music freely.
<BR>
<P>For some, if their music is copied, or in others words it influences others,
<BR>
then that is sometimes a benefit to the originator, in some cases.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux has been paid for one way or another. The price might be hidden but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has been paid and it has been thriving on the swing/carrousel principle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There is a concept of sum societal utility.  Linux, free, has contributed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sum societal utility many times over its investment given by volunteer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;programmers and supporters, some might say.  Some statistics have it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;half the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It has made it cheaper to run an IT business yes. But not more than that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It has contributed to the sum societal utility moreso than it has cost it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Copyright laws are in place for a reason, and most of them are good laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;patent laws, in my opinion, are cumbersome and infringe upon the growth of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;societal utility, and any patent should expire in twelve years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahh... we probably agree here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Max M Rasmussen (Denmark)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes we do.
<BR>
<P>In regards to sum societal utility, I suggest the Samuelson Utility Function, my
<BR>
favorite economic function.  Thusly, almost everything may be subjected to
<BR>
cost-benefit analysis, which includes the air that we breathe.
<BR>
<P>Have a nice day,
<BR>
<P>Ross
