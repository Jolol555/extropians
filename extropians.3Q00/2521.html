This is from the Seeds of Change eNewsletter #12 I was tempted to

*A farmer's lament
<BR>
----------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Don Dunklee, an organic grower in Michigan, submitted the following
<BR>
article to our eGroup Forum
<BR>
<P>Counterpoint: milkweeds, monarchs and genetically modified
<BR>
agriculture.
<BR>
<P>I am a farmer. I knew that since I was 5. I grow crops. The land I
<BR>
farm also grows butterflies, birds, earthworms and wildflowers, or
<BR>
at least now I think it is supposed to. Right now I am having
<BR>
trouble figuring out what kind of farmer I am or should be. This
<BR>
question is not just for me, but for everyone. I am concerned that
<BR>
there is no room for bluebirds and butterflies in big precision
<BR>
genetically modified-producing agriculture, described in an April
<BR>
30-May 3 Star Tribune series.
<BR>
<P>In 1995 I thought I was going to be a big farmer and rented land
<BR>
from one side of the county to the other. I guess the best way to
<BR>
characterize attitudes about faraway rented land is you don't find
<BR>
yourself putting up birdhouses on it. It is an economic decision.
<BR>
We live in the middle of our farm. When you live on the land you
<BR>
farm, you find yourself wanting to plant trees and put up
<BR>
birdhouses. Sometimes the weeds are wildflowers that the bugs
<BR>
treasure, and you and your kids bring them into your house and
<BR>
cherish them.
<BR>
<P>Twelve years ago, I rented land that had sat idle for two years. It
<BR>
was full of weeds -- annual weeds, perennial weeds, lots and lots
<BR>
of milkweed, classic big huge milkweeds. The battle began.
<BR>
<P>For a number of years, I never really got on top of those milkweeds
<BR>
and they never really got on top of the crop. One year I put the
<BR>
field in wheat and had a chance to end it for the milkweeds. The
<BR>
timing of the herbicide application would have to be perfect. It
<BR>
rained when I was supposed to spray.
<BR>
<P>Looking back, I think this was supposed to happen. I would drive by
<BR>
that field and try not to look at those oh-so-healthy milkweeds.
<BR>
Finally one day I stopped to look at my wheat and milkweed field.
<BR>
Nearly every milkweed had a monarch butterfly caterpillar on it.
<BR>
Milkweed is the sole host of the monarch butterfly caterpillar. We
<BR>
didn't make much off the wheat, and nearly choked on the milkweed
<BR>
fuzz in the straw, but took solace in knowing we raised a good crop
<BR>
of monarchs that year.
<BR>
<P>In 1997, Roundup Ready genetically engineered soybeans became
<BR>
widely available. Roundup herbicide kills everything green except
<BR>
the soybeans with the genetic alteration. The application window is
<BR>
huge. I grew some of these soybeans. The milkweeds are gone. I
<BR>
didn't stop to think about this until the summer of 1999 when it
<BR>
was reported that pollen from Bt corn, another genetically
<BR>
engineered crop, was getting on the milkweed in field borders and
<BR>
may be killing the monarch butterfly caterpillars. I found myself
<BR>
hoping that the offspring of the monarchs I had displaced had not
<BR>
wound up next to a Bt corn field. Odds are they will. Before
<BR>
Roundup Ready genetic engineering, it was difficult to kill
<BR>
milkweed in crops. My milkweeds are gone. My neighbor's milkweeds
<BR>
are gone. Farmers using Roundup Ready genetics in soybeans, cotton,
<BR>
corn and sugar-beets are eradicating milkweed from their field
<BR>
nationwide, forcing the monarch butterflies to lay their eggs on
<BR>
milkweed in field borders and ditches. Have we done well? Perhaps
<BR>
not by the butterflies.
<BR>
<P>Who is going to tell our children?

RoundUp?

<EM>&gt;From the Organic Trade Association comes this report:
</EM><BR>
Glyphosate (commonly known as Roundup) linked to Non-Hodgkin's
<BR>
Lymphoma
<BR>
<P>A population-based case-control study conducted in Sweden between
<BR>
1987 and 1990 by oncologists Dr. Lennart Hardell and Dr. Mikael
<BR>
Eriksson concluded that exposure to herbicides and fungicides
<BR>
resulted in significantly increased risks for non-Hodgkin's
<BR>
lymphoma (NHL), a form of cancer. In the study, published in the
<BR>
March 15 Journal of American Cancer Society, the researchers
<BR>
concluded that in particular, exposure to glyphosate &quot;yielded
<BR>
increased risks for NHL&quot;. Glyphosate is the world's most widely
<BR>
used herbicide. It is estimated that over 112,000 metric tons were
<BR>
used worldwide during 1998. Companies developing
<BR>
herbicide-resistant crops also are increasing their production for
<BR>
herbicides such as glyphosate and requesting permits for higher
<BR>
residues of these chemicals in genetically engineered food.
<BR>
Monsanto, for instance, has received permits for a threefold
<BR>
increase in herbicide residues--from 6 parts
<BR>
per million to 20 parts per million on genetically engineered
<BR>
soybeans in Europe and the United States.
