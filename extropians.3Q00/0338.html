<EM>&gt;Do you think that these several devout catholics are typical?
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably not.  Most of my friends are university educated.  That
<BR>
probaly insulates me from alot of bozos.  There are certainly lots of
<BR>
devoutly religious people in my department (muslim grad students, for
<BR>
example, that pray 5 times a day in the office, or undergrad muslims
<BR>
who need to take out a few minutes during a midterm exam to pray, and
<BR>
certainly lots of Jews as well---and they even get along with Muslims!
<BR>
Hey, this is Canada, where we all get along.  But I digress...).  Right
<BR>
now I have a muslim office-mate who's a perfectly ordinary guy, tells
<BR>
jokes and laughs... mind you, I haven't tried joking about his religion
<BR>
yet.  But the Catholic guy of which I spoke was sitting beside me for 5
<BR>
years, and he certainly liked to show me Catholic jokes on the Web.
