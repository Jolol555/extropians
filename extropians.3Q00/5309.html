<EM>&gt;  &gt; If a large number of the developers get dissatisfied with the decisions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; of the manager, any of the developers can take the code base and fork
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; it.  The central manager would have to screw up big time in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; provoke such a reaction, but it is possible - and that, alone, can keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the manager honest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but then we're talking about two different projects. Since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fork was provoked by a screwup on manager's part, one of them seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destined to crash and burn. There *are* a number of OpenSource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screwups out there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted.  But the projects start from the same base, so it is possible
<BR>
for them to share improvements much more than any random two projects,
<BR>
almost as if they were still the same project...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Anarchic software development does not work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Define &quot;anarchic&quot;.  No body of law ties, say, Linux developers to Linus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Headless. No central arbitrator. Everybody can touch everything, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distribute the end result under the same name. I'm not saying it can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work theoretically, but lacking angels it doesn't seem to work in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice.
</EM><BR>
<P>People are gonna trust a newbie stranger as much as they trust someone
<BR>
they already know?  To argue for that ignores human nature.
<BR>
<P>But that's not the nature of anarchy, and that's not the nature of Open
<BR>
Source.  That's not even really what it's being sold as, though it is
<BR>
similar enough to be very confusing.  (For one, if a project is forked,
<BR>
then the forks have their own identifiers - imposed by the users if not
<BR>
by the forker - so it's not the case that the *exact* same name
<BR>
identifies both forks.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Torvaldis.  Linus can not hire or fire developers; he can only make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; acceptance of their code more or less likely.  (He can't even absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A great damn deal more or less likely. You try putting something into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the kernel what Linus (or Alan Cox, or any of the core team) thinks is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my own copy of the kernel?  No sweat; having the source means that I
<BR>
can do that, and owning my own hardware means that no one else can tell
<BR>
me what I can do with it.
<BR>
<P>In the &quot;official&quot; copy of the kernel?  Not right away, true.  But if I
<BR>
run a copy with the mod over time, and demonstrate the advantage, I can
<BR>
eventually convince the core team and get it in there...whereas, with
<BR>
proprietary software, I could never conduct such a demonstration, so the
<BR>
only criteria with which the core team could judge would be their
<BR>
initial negative speculation.
<BR>
<P>(This is assuming that it is a feature that provides value to users.  If
<BR>
it isn't...well, ideally, proprietary software wouldn't have &quot;features&quot;
<BR>
that only hurt the user, but we all know that isn't the case, especially
<BR>
with the VP of Sales' pet feature.  With Linux, &quot;just because Linus says
<BR>
so&quot; isn't good enough if everyone else disagrees...and there have been
<BR>
cases like that, to my knowledge.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; reject software on his own, though his negative review can go a long way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; towards rejecting certain code.)  Promises, trust, and working code are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Code that works for you might not work for me, and vice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versa. Architectural decisions are frequently incompatible.
</EM><BR>
<P>Code that accomplishes a certain function in a certain way does so for
<BR>
everyone.  Take, for example, this mailing list: the software that runs
<BR>
it obviously works well enough that we can both use it...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; all that unify the developers - and this lack of law is, technically,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;anarchy&quot;, in the form that some promoters of anarchy envision as their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; utopia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still see no evidence that there are nontrivial OpenSource projects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which work by pure anarchy. Can you name an example?
</EM><BR>
<P>By the meaning of &quot;anarchy&quot; in my dictionary, yes.  By the meaning in
<BR>
yours - which corresponds, in mine, to &quot;unorganized chaos&quot; -
<BR>
unsurprisingly no.
<BR>
<P>But even if there are no laws, that doesn't mean you have to let me pick
<BR>
your pocket.  If you allow the concept that some people can declare
<BR>
certain modules as their own, such that others can see and make their
<BR>
own copies of, but not directly alter, then one could argue that the
<BR>
content of the Web - the *content*, mind you, not necessarily the
<BR>
languages and programs that allow it to be viewed - is, itself, one big
<BR>
open source effort.  I can easily view the HTML on your site, and put up
<BR>
my own exactly identical.  You can try various ways to get me to stop if
<BR>
you want, but there's no central authority that governs everyone.  (Try
<BR>
getting, say, a US court order enforced in Canada.)  I can copy all your
<BR>
tips and tricks, and come up with my own improvements on them; you are
<BR>
free to do the same right back.  The audience (users) choose which is
<BR>
the superior one, and spread word of it; the loser usually remains
<BR>
obscure.
