<EM>&gt; &gt; Oh boy, now its a pissing contest. Frankly, most of the people I know in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transhumanism are most definitely NOT vapid escapists, extropians in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If Exi were more into vapid escapism I'm sure they'd have a far larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; following, even just in California.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'm sure that the science fiction reading Extropians that I've been running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into since college in 1992 who are waiting for that ideal future after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity when they can upload their minds and create their own personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universes are not escapists. The fact that most of them that I've known don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do anything towards this end, hold dead-end jobs and play lots of Dungeons and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dragons isn't terribly telling, right?
</EM><BR>
<P>Which extropians are these exactly?  The telling difference between those 'D&amp;D
<BR>
playing' extropians (none that I know over age 16) and the vapid escapists are
<BR>
that extropes know such things are fantasy, while the vapid escapists that are
<BR>
into mysticism think that that is the real world. There is a significant
<BR>
difference between the two.
<BR>
<P>Most extropes I know do work toward many of the goals of extropians, though
<BR>
typically those which interest them the most. The artists do art, the engineers
<BR>
do things like design and build rockets, the medical people research longevity,
<BR>
intelligence, and cryonics, the computer people work on computers.
<BR>
<P>Take ANY extropian I know, and they have far more on the ball than any non
<BR>
extrope I know, on average, and vastly more than any mystic I know, who
<BR>
typically are still playing with crystals into middle age.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The dream world that some have painted for life after the mythical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; singularity bears an amazing resemblance to the religious doctrine of some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faiths.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh please. Sounds like one more troll.
