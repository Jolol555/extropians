<P>The researchers recently discovered that errant bacteria survive in the 
<BR>
cleanest of clean rooms by inducing the top semiconductor layer on chips to 
<BR>
grow over them, thereby embedding themselves inside the chip. 
<BR>
<P>When SUNY researcher Robert Baier started to investigate the role bacteria 
<BR>
play in the yield problem, he knew they were avoiding even the most stringent 
<BR>
attempts to eradicate them — the bugs just wouldn't die. How could bacteria 
<BR>
survive where no other living thing can? Baier, funded by the National 
<BR>
Science Foundation, found the answer, but it wasn't what he expected. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;When we started this study, we were just trying to find the source of 
<BR>
bacteria in the fab, and how they could remain alive after all the heroic 
<BR>
measures to eradicate them with ultraviolet light, ozone and everything else 
<BR>
including a dollar a gallon to purify the water,&quot; said Baier, who is director 
<BR>
of the Center for Biosurfaces at SUNY. 
<BR>
<P>Other scientists and engineers participated in the research at the Center for 
<BR>
Microcontamination Control at the University of Arizona, the Rensselaer 
<BR>
Polytechnic Institute in New York and the Center for Environmentally Benign 
<BR>
Semiconductor Manufacturing at the University of Arizona. 
<BR>
<P>The problem wasn't people in the fab getting sick — those kinds of bacteria 
<BR>
were easy to kill. Rather, it concerned some clever bugs that just wouldn't 
<BR>
die, no matter what — bacteria that can survive in the vacuum of space, or 
<BR>
inside a volcanic vent at the bottom of the sea. They can hibernate 
<BR>
indefinitely and only need the slightest bit of light to wake up and thrive 
<BR>
anew. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;We found that these extremely hard-to-kill bacteria were coming in with the 
<BR>
ultrapure water, and the way they survived our calculated assault was to 
<BR>
capture a tiny bit of semiconductor that had dissolved in the ultrapure water 
<BR>
and start growing,&quot; said Baier. 
<BR>
<P>Once the bacterium sticks a molecule of semiconductor to itself, other 
<BR>
dissolved crystals spontaneously attach themselves to the formation, growing 
<BR>
islands atop silicon wafers during a subsequent vapor deposition step. 
<BR>
<P>In short order, the bacteria have encased themselves inside armored shells of 
<BR>
semiconductor, making them impervious to all the attempts by clean-room 
<BR>
personnel to kill them. &quot;These bacteria can cause a lot of problems in the 
<BR>
clean room, like shorting out adjacent lines on chips, and inside these 
<BR>
armored shells they are almost impossible to kill,&quot; said Baier. &quot;Now we are 
<BR>
turning a problem into a feature. A plant is basically a single-electron 
<BR>
photonic device converting light into electricity. If we embed a 
<BR>
photosensitive bacteria inside a chip, we have the beginnings of a 
<BR>
biotransistor.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Baier's goal of harnessing bacteria as the active element in a transistor may 
<BR>
not be as far-fetched as it sounds — at least his theory sounds convincing. 
<BR>
He points out that copper is a conductor because it has one free electron per 
<BR>
atom to contribute to current flow. Semiconductors are called &quot;semi&quot; because 
<BR>
they have only about one free electron per thousand atoms, depending on 
<BR>
doping levels. Current flow in those semiconductors, unlike copper, can be 
<BR>
precisely controlled by parameters that match the parameters of bacteria, 
<BR>
according to Baier, enabling regular transistors to switch from an insulator 
<BR>
into a conductor by changing state. 
<BR>
<P>'Many uses'
<BR>
<P><P>These small charge transfers, Baier contends, are just what happens in common 
<BR>
biological processes like respiration and photosynthesis. In fact, he 
<BR>
believes that the current flowing in a semiconductor can be controlled by the 
<BR>
chlorophyll in a single cell. For instance, when light shines on a 
<BR>
photosensitive bacterium, it yields up an electron that could be used to 
<BR>
switch a primitive biotransistor. &quot;This is a new class of biochips, which I 
<BR>
believe can be adapted to many uses, but at present it's at a primitive 
<BR>
stage, like the crude crystal detectors that preceded today's radios,&quot; said 
<BR>
Baier. 
<BR>
<P>The theory is that doping semiconductors is always done to disrupt the 
<BR>
perfect lattice, making free electrons or &quot;holes&quot; available in &quot;n-&quot; and &quot;p-&quot; 
<BR>
type semiconductors, respectively. Likewise, if a biological atom, say 
<BR>
phosphorus with five electrons from a bacterium's cell, is doped into a 
<BR>
silicon crystal that only needs four, it then makes the fifth electron 
<BR>
available, enabling biological cells to serve as metabolic &quot;sources&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;sinks&quot; for electrons and &quot;holes&quot; in biotransistors. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Biological membranes have been known to develop potentials of a million 
<BR>
volts per centimeter. They are perfect for semiconductors, and biochips using 
<BR>
them could be made as small as five microns on a side,&quot; said Baier. 
<BR>
<P>According to Baier, most of the steps used to build chips today will continue 
<BR>
to be used in manufacturing his biochips. For instance, masks will be used on 
<BR>
the semiconductor doped with bacteria, as will diffusion, sputtering and 
<BR>
other common deposition techniques. All the other common devices like 
<BR>
resistors and capacitors will be built into circuits connected to the 
<BR>
biotransistors. 
<BR>
<P>Optical amps
<BR>
<P><P>Biotransistors will also simplify optical communications by amplifying 
<BR>
optical beams the way a normal transistor amplifies electrical current. And 
<BR>
Baier envisions the construction of light-sensitive heterojunctions where 
<BR>
lattices of different energy gaps are &quot;biodoped&quot; so that their crystalline 
<BR>
lattices mesh imperfectly, creating atomic-scale defects and strains with 
<BR>
useful photonic and electrical side effects to drive circuitry. Such 
<BR>
heterojunctions would harness complicated biophysical reactions to provide a 
<BR>
tunable variable for design problems. 
<BR>
<P>For now, Baier will be satisfied if he can build a &quot;crystal&quot; radio with his 
<BR>
biochip architecture. His approach will be to follow the recipe of Bardeen 
<BR>
and Brattain when they invented the world's first transistor. As with the 
<BR>
original, Baier plans to attach two fine wires only micrometers apart, but 
<BR>
this time in a biodoped germanium crystal that has been bonded to a metal 
<BR>
disk. The assembly will be housed inside a metal cylinder electrically 
<BR>
grounded to the disk. Bardeen and Brattain's &quot;cat's whisker&quot; will be 
<BR>
connected to a meter to register success or failure.
