<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Ross's idea is sound, where people have legally purchased copies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of their music downloaded to their system. If they want to make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;available to all (and make some money off of late return fees),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they need to use an app that not only uploads the single copy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the music to the library server, but maintains some sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'overlord' log of all activity using that music file on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;persons system, so they could not upload it to the library if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there is a record of them retaining a copy on a backup tape, CDR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;floppy, etc. The app would allow them to 'check out' music files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that are properly licensed, and the library server can only allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as many downloads as it has legal licenses for. Users that don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;return the files they downloaded on time pay late fees, which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;split between the library server company and whoever purchased the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;original file and made it available to the public on the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(which could be the server company, a music listener, or even the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artist or his recording company). In this case, an artist or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recording company could presumably make 1000 licenses available to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the server library, and make money off of late fees. Users that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incur late fees are given the option by email to either return the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;music, pay the late fees to hold onto the music for x amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time, or buy the music license outright.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;THIS could potentially be a money making dot com idea, although I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;am concerned about news that Napster has distributed its server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;source code over the net and others are now setting up their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;servers elsewhere to run independent of Napster and US Courts.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is all related to some ideas I had several years ago.
<BR>
<P>Everybody was entranced with the idea of video-on-demand, and I
<BR>
thought they had overlooked a much easier and possibly more
<BR>
profitable idea, music-on-demand.
<BR>
<P>The first idea was to create a &quot;Universal Jukebox&quot; basically a
<BR>
computer based interface linked by XDSL to a central server complex
<BR>
containing every piece of music ever recorded. Royalties were to be
<BR>
paid to the artists or their trusts on an instantaneous (or at
<BR>
least daily basis. I've seen this idea appear now in the media as
<BR>
a QWEST commercial.
<BR>
<P>The second related idea was for &quot;Personnal Radio Station&quot; basically
<BR>
an at home version of the same, you would pay a basic service
<BR>
charge, and could order up anything you want, no need to buy CD's
<BR>
anymore.
<BR>
<P>Anyway I wrote it all up and sent it to my bosses at the phone
<BR>
company, and got a &quot;thanks but don't call us etc&quot; in return. Of
<BR>
course the idea I sent before that back in 1991 was &quot;call blocking
<BR>
refusal&quot; which they didn't like either, but as &quot;privacy manager&quot;
<BR>
was international telecom product of the year last year.
<BR>
<P>Anyway I think both ideas are still valid. When I came up with them
<BR>
it was pre-WWW so today's version instead of relying on central
<BR>
server farms might merely download the appropriate materials from
<BR>
servers controlled by the various artists themselves. And of course
<BR>
any modern PC with appropriate software could function as either
<BR>
device. (platform independent.)
<BR>
<P>The really cool part was all the value added profit involved, who
<BR>
is listening to what where is extremely valuable information. Just
<BR>
having a setup like this puts you in the Nielsen ratings business.
<BR>
<P>If a particular band is popular in a sufficiently sized city they
<BR>
could decide to do a concert there. ETC,ETC,ETC.
