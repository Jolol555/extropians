<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Ross's idea is sound, where people have legally purchased copies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;of their music downloaded to their system. If they want to make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;available to all (and make some money off of late return fees),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;they need to use an app that not only uploads the single copy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the music to the library server, but maintains some sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;'overlord' log of all activity using that music file on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;persons system, so they could not upload it to the library if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;there is a record of them retaining a copy on a backup tape, CDR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;floppy, etc. The app would allow them to 'check out' music files
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;that are properly licensed, and the library server can only allow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;as many downloads as it has legal licenses for. Users that don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;return the files they downloaded on time pay late fees, which are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;split between the library server company and whoever purchased the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;original file and made it available to the public on the server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;(which could be the server company, a music listener, or even the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;artist or his recording company). In this case, an artist or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;recording company could presumably make 1000 licenses available to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the server library, and make money off of late fees. Users that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;incur late fees are given the option by email to either return the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;music, pay the late fees to hold onto the music for x amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;time, or buy the music license outright.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;THIS could potentially be a money making dot com idea, although I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;am concerned about news that Napster has distributed its server
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;source code over the net and others are now setting up their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;servers elsewhere to run independent of Napster and US Courts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is all related to some ideas I had several years ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Everybody was entranced with the idea of video-on-demand, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought they had overlooked a much easier and possibly more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; profitable idea, music-on-demand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a buddy right now who is interested in backing initial development of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such a project to the tune of about $50,000.00. Anyone interested in doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development work on this???
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll tell you how I would go about it.
<BR>
<P>First, find the media format you want to use.  A good choice would be MPEG I
<BR>
Audio Layer III, the intellectual property assignment of which is of FHG,
<BR>
Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.
<BR>
<P>The next issue is client and server software.  Basically, a client has to be
<BR>
somehow uniquely identified, if anonymously so.  The server software is a
<BR>
database and interface to high performance disk I/O, and some glue logic.
<BR>
<P>So, the client software is an ASPI or other CD-ROM reader, which reads Redbook
<BR>
audio off of CD-ROMs and writes it to raw audio on the client, where it is
<BR>
converted to MP3 (in lieu of any compressed format) and encrypted with the
<BR>
client's anonymous key.  Then, the client makes affidavit that it is there only
<BR>
digital copy of the CD track, this can be affirmed with a digital signature.  At
<BR>
that point, the compressed, encrypted track is uploaded to the server.
<BR>
<P>The server checks in tracks by their owner.  As tracks come in, they are
<BR>
catalogued by artist, genre, album, anonymous owner, etcetera.  They are
<BR>
decrypted or not for storage on the server.
<BR>
<P>The client then checks out some tracks, by searching for those it would and
<BR>
selecting them, or putting holds on ones that are checked out already.  The
<BR>
server encrypts the selected files and sends them to the client, they are
<BR>
encrypted thus that play only on one client's client software, which would
<BR>
unfortunately have to be a black box in that sense.
<BR>
<P>At issue is whether the server would have to delete the track on checkout, or if
<BR>
it could keep a backup copy.  They key is that only one may play the ripped
<BR>
track at a time.
<BR>
<P>There are various legalities involved.  Also, there are various options.  It
<BR>
could be a free community lending library.  Also, it could be a rental store
<BR>
online, where essentially people could contribute the songs from their purchased
<BR>
albums and users would pay a nominal playback fee, the key feature being that
<BR>
anyone could put their purcahsed tracks on the shelves.  Thus, like libraries or
<BR>
used music stores, people could browse and either use the free community library
<BR>
or rentmusic.com.
