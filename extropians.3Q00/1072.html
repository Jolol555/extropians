<EM>&gt; Unless you can take the consciousness out of the machine there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are going to be a lot of people arguing you can't use it as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a slave.  If it is a free agent, then a lot of legal groundwork
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will need to be laid for it to act as an economic agent (have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a S.S. number, pay taxes, etc.).  Then if it doesn't own its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardware it could end up paying hefty lease fees to IBM or whomever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does own it.  Looks like a swamp to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>And if you make a copy, isn't that a new person, and if so, don't they
<BR>
need a new SS number?  And what about immigration laws?  If an upload
<BR>
is emailed across the border, do they need a passport?
<BR>
<P>It seems almost comical to consider these questions.  Uploads somehow
<BR>
don't fit into the world as we know it.
<BR>
<P>This suggests to me that uploading won't be something that happens off
<BR>
in a lab somewhere without anyone caring until success is achieved.
<BR>
Just as we have seen with Bill Joy's discovery of new technologies, the
<BR>
ideas we have been discussing for years will gradually become part of the
<BR>
mainstream.  As uploading starts to become possible in the near future,
<BR>
people from all walks of life will begin to consider the consequences.
<BR>
<P>There will come a time when the prospect of uploading will be discussed
<BR>
by columnists, theologians, and politicians.  People will grapple with
<BR>
the questions: Shall we do this?  Should it be allowed?  What are the
<BR>
rights of the uploaded person?
<BR>
<P>My guess is that the situation will be somewhat similar to human cloning.
<BR>
There will be a moratorium on experiments with human beings until the
<BR>
ethical and legal issues can be settled.
<BR>
<P>I don't know how well these kinds of restrictions will work, but I
<BR>
suspect that over the next few decades we will see many technologies
<BR>
being limited in this way, nanotech in particular.  Research doesn't
<BR>
happen in a vaccuum, and once people understand the potential changes
<BR>
these technologies will bring, they and their political representatives
<BR>
will want to control the impact.
