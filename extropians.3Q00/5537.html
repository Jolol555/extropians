<EM>&gt; The mindset that enables one to separate themselves from the herd offers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than just the ability to defend against an inter-species attack: when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the lemmings march over the cliff, it's the socially disconnected who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survive.  That both strategies persist in nature (and in man) suggests that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each have offered their share of success in the past, but the changes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our environment that we foresee in the near future could easily tip the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; balance heavily one way or the other.  Whether the balance will tip, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which way: I haven't a clue--but for many of us the wager has long since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been laid (in my case, I suspect it was at my conception...).
</EM><BR>
<P>That's an interesting point.  I would point to the increasing
<BR>
inter-dependence of members of society as our world becomes
<BR>
more complex, on the other side.  Robin Hanson's article,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/dreamautarky.html</A>, discusses the seeming paradox
<BR>
that Extropians dream of a more individualistic society while we have
<BR>
historically moved in the opposite direction.
<BR>
<P>The division of labor, trade, and specialization has been the foundation
<BR>
of technological progress.  If each person had to do everything for
<BR>
himself, we'd still be in the stone age.  My bet is that the man who can
<BR>
work smoothly with his fellows is the one who has the survival advantage.
