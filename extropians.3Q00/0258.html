GREG BIRCH SAID: &quot;...The scenarios that concern me are those involving
<BR>
medical techniques which might become possible in the intermediate term that
<BR>
won't be available in first world countries because of slow, bureaucratic
<BR>
approval processes and/or fear of backlash from religious or other
<BR>
&quot;bio-conservatives&quot;...&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Some techniques exist already and are innocuous.. CR can be
<BR>
handled in a spa environment. Certainly, it's poorly done by inexperienced
<BR>
people... and the popularizing books don't seem to help.
<BR>
<P>GH on the very old seems useful... also certain steroids are well worth
<BR>
it...
<BR>
<P>...and techniques now exist to insert genes into living whole systems... but
<BR>
the political fallout from application of this latter technology in humans
<BR>
could be potentially massive.
<BR>
<P>(Most current LE techniques do little to stem the cosmetic &quot;decline&quot;  seen
<BR>
in 30 - 50 year olds... these are mostly the effects of maturation and less
<BR>
of &quot;classical&quot; senescence. I guess the best effort here would be to
<BR>
forestall the development of atheroma... a drug/dsupplement/lifestyle
<BR>
combinatation does this very effectively. Great for a spa environment.)
<BR>
<P>GREG BURCH SAID: &quot;...How do you find the medical doctors and other
<BR>
professionals and technicians to man such a facility?  The problems are
<BR>
obvious: You want good people, but anyone involved in such a facility risks
<BR>
loss of professional credentials and becoming a professional pariah...&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Use third World medical professionals. They work for peanuts...
<BR>
and their communities don't censure them as strongly for eccentric
<BR>
therapeutics.
<BR>
<P>GEORGE BURCH SAID: &quot;...The choices are basically two: An island with
<BR>
a legal regime that will tolerate the clinic, or a ship in international
<BR>
waters..&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: What about Brasil or India? They both delight in thumbing their
<BR>
noses at G7 countries.
