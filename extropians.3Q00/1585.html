<P>Depends on what you mean by cost.  The real cost would be the
<BR>
loss of all that matter here, where its value would be inestimable.
<BR>
<P>This is a topic Ive been giving more and more thought to recently as
<BR>
I have learned of plans by a private company to land on an asteroid,
<BR>
at which time that asteroid passes into private ownership.  Im
<BR>
not debating whether or not it should become private property.  {I
<BR>
beleive it should, but thats another debate.
<BR>
<P>Im pointing out that it will do so, under our current understanding of
<BR>
interstellar law.  Anyone who lands on any interplanetary body can
<BR>
claim as much of it as she can defend.  This puts a whole new spin
<BR>
on space exploration, does it not?  spike
