<P>&lt;&lt; Well, Joseph Campbell insisted that God was made completely of our 
<BR>
thoughts, 
<BR>
&nbsp;a self-activating metaphor for the energies that surround us ...and that the 
<BR>
&nbsp;god construct we imagine guides our actions. In that capacity it has a use.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Dunno if we can make a computer be a god, which seems to be what some of us 
<BR>
&nbsp;are asking for ---  but we can certainly &quot;make&quot; new metaphors from our 
<BR>
&nbsp;thoughts - create new myths... experience ecstasy, wonder awe - and guide 
<BR>
&nbsp;ourselves into good actions -- &quot;overactive god modules&quot; or not! 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I'd base my metaphor/god  on compassion, vitality, loving acts, 
<BR>
contradiction 
<BR>
&nbsp;and humor! &gt;&gt;
<BR>
This is very interesting and goes along with what Damien Broderick noted ( in 
<BR>
his book, The Spike) about writer, Gregory Benford, concerning his concept of 
<BR>
memes being, perhaps, the highest level of existence in the universe. Please 
<BR>
also realize that this climbing the Jacob's Ladder of evolution, may well 
<BR>
take thousands to Quadrillions of years to accomplish.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;There is enough time to be an atheist, enough time to develop some decent 
<BR>
technologies, enough time to advance medicine, and social organization, and 
<BR>
economics, time enough time to lessen entropy's grip on the human condition, 
<BR>
and time enough to expand, asymtotically, into outer space. It won't be &quot;us 
<BR>
humans&quot; making a computer a god anyway, but it will be our descendents, who 
<BR>
may be less into worshipping idols, human and otherwise, then us.
