<P><EM> &gt; Well, I'm not a VB programmer, but I'm still seriously underqualified to do
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; more than rant vaguely about genetic programming. Eugene has a passing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; familiarity with this stuff; got a status report on state-of-the-art for us?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The (pathetic) state of the art is stuff being done by John Koza. You
<BR>
can read him up on the web, and in several (by now three) fat MIT
<BR>
Press bibles, all titled Genetic Programming (I, II and now III if not
<BR>
IV, I believe), where he struts his (some of them actually pretty
<BR>
nifty) achievements.
<BR>
<P>The field has huge potential, but is right now stuck imo slightly
<BR>
before cyanobacteria stage, for several reasons. Most of them is that
<BR>
mature (those having lived through a few iterations) evolutionary
<BR>
algorithms are very subtle, not all details of natural instances of
<BR>
them are known, and the few Comp. Sci. evolutionary algorithm
<BR>
practitioners ignore even what little we already know, standing smack
<BR>
middle in da Nile. Sounds a lot like AI, huh?
<BR>
<P>The difficulty resides in: having enough crunch (Koza has a 512 CPU
<BR>
Beowulf in St.Anford, which is a good start), a large enough
<BR>
population (depends on the problem, may be dynamic), a suitable
<BR>
mutable substrate (machine (Java VM) instructions or even SEXPRs are
<BR>
that not) and a flexible enough framework (which could compensate for
<BR>
less than perfect substrate, and do further industrial-strength
<BR>
magick). The latter is not at all addressed (and in fact is
<BR>
surprisingly difficult to attack), for instance the importance of the
<BR>
mutation function itself having to be mutable (most assuredly true for
<BR>
wet evolutionary systems, it sure as hell doesn't equal-probability
<BR>
shotgun-mutate, especially something as brittle as computer languages)
<BR>
is not recognized. (At least Koza told me that he doesn't see the
<BR>
point of it beyond the obvious crude hand-coded optimizations, making
<BR>
moi very distraught indeed).
<BR>
<P>Another reason is that GP looks like programming straight from the
<BR>
Salpetriere to most Comp. Sci. people, unless they are martians. Clash
<BR>
of paradigms, very much so.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I'm not expecting Koza to make a breakthrough (partly, because of
<BR>
above reasons), and I'm not aware of any practitioners with a real
<BR>
budget and an open-minded approach, so near future prognosis is less
<BR>
than good. But, yeah, eventually somebody somewhen will cut it, we go
<BR>
into the Cambrian explosion regime and there will be much boisterous
<BR>
frolicking and merriment in the streets (with the exception of
<BR>
computer securety people, these who have not yet shot themselves will
<BR>
be looking for new jobs).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I'm a bit afraid that the business plan would look something like:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;     1 - Get lots o money
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;     2 - Spend lots o money doing heaps of cool research into genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; programming, play around with oh so excellent equipment, discover some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; excellent stuff, have a bloody fantastic time
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;     3 - Run out of money with no products/market to show for it,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;     4 - get a slapping (eek) from the VC(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;     5 - Reputation in ruins, become a tramp, scavenge in bins, waiting for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the singularity
</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno about 5 (participating in a .com burnout will raise your job
<BR>
market value), but 1-4 is imo exactly how the shit can be expected to
<BR>
go down. &lt;/old curmugeon&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Emlyn, die hard optimist
