<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would it be fair to ask how long until Atkins overtakes, say, Smith?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ^_-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean Smith as in the Matrix agent common name?  :-)  Shit, they're
<BR>
onto us.  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; What else?  The pattern is a bit different in that I have strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; empathic abilities and a deep mystical streak.  I mainly and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; successfully fight the latter these days and don't make that much use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the former.  But at one time I almost decided it was time to junk the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; high-tech career and become the first Sister of the Church of the Holy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Nanite.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well...you don't have to fight it.  Empathy can give you insight into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human nature...and to the best of our knowledge, which species built all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this high tech stuff that we're working with?  Guessing based on, &quot;if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a typical programmer/system designer/whatever I know the maker of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I'm faced with was, how would I have set this up,&quot; has saved me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much time in the past.  That is one of the things that sets applied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer science apart from, say, chemical engineering.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What can I say?  I have an intermittenly over-active
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; God-module.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well... I've considered that if there isn't a God (and I've spent most
<BR>
of my life believing there isn't) then it is high time we built one -
<BR>
build an intelligence that does have as close to all the
<BR>
&quot;omni&quot;-characteristics possible in this universe.  But without all the
<BR>
high-handed ego-tripping attributed to such in some people's model.  Or
<BR>
better still become gods and goddesses ourselves.  If we dare and are
<BR>
willing to change as radically as that will require.  It is a wierd
<BR>
thing to think about when most of us have trouble even claiming what
<BR>
human greatness and uniqueness is in us.  We monkeys don't like to stand
<BR>
out too much.  Especially when we have little idea what the heck is
<BR>
going on inside of us and less willingness to field our guesswork and
<BR>
vague glimmerings lest the other monkeys ostracize us or worse.  
<BR>
<P>But when the God module kicks in things happen similar to stuff in  the
<BR>
mystical literature.  I don't levitate or anything really wild like that
<BR>
but it feels as if my being is lifted up and sometimes turned inside out
<BR>
and that I am within or in communion with or at least sense deeply this
<BR>
much larger Presence, Power, whatever you want to call it. The &quot;me&quot;
<BR>
disappears mostly or melts into whatever this is or gets recast
<BR>
somehow.   The emotions soar into the heavens.  It goes beyond anything
<BR>
I can put into words pretty rapidly. Often it will include what seems
<BR>
like a tremendous amount of information  and intensionality and directed
<BR>
energy sweeping through me.  I have guesses (ranging from faulty mental
<BR>
wiring to too much religous upbringing to substances sampled in my
<BR>
youth  to Vingean powers looking for agents to ???) but no real
<BR>
explanation for it.  It just is - now and then.  Thankfully rare enough
<BR>
it doesn't totally sweep me away.  It came close when I used to meditate
<BR>
more.  Whatever it is meditation intensified it quite a bit.  So I
<BR>
stopped doing that because shadows of whatever this is became too strong
<BR>
to allow me to concentrate on my work easily.
