<P><EM>&gt;No, since monarchs are not dependent upon corn for their diet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there are many other crops being planted besides corn, as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wild growth in uncultivated areas.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yes, and I suspect that areas that are overwhelmingly covered with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this GM corn would simply be flown around by the monarchs, much as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;migratory waterfowl change their migratory routes to fit the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;availability of wetlands.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I'm not sure. However, I have found from my own experience that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Monarch Butterfly's primary diet is NOT pollen or leaves from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plants like corn, but they feed on animal dung. You heard it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thats right, animal dung. During the monarch migration through our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;area, I never see monarchs in cornfields. I do however see them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;congregating en masse on piles of cow, deer, and moose dung. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;key fact in my mind tends to blow out of the water the claims of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the anti-GM bunch about a threat to the Monarch Butterfly. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the GM corn IS a threat to is the Boll Weevil, which DOES feed on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corn, as well as cotton. However the fact that the anti-GM bunch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chooses to emphasise a marginal if not false threat to the Monarch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Butterfly, which most people like and think are beautiful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;creatures, and ignore or deemphasise the threat to the Boll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Weevil, which most people will admit is a pest that is better off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the endangered species list, fits in perfectly with my theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the 'Cute and Fuzzy' modus operandi of the Greens, which only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incriminates their personal as well as scientific integrity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(assuming there was any to begin with).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Monarch larvae eat only members of the Milkweed family, adults only
<BR>
drink nectar.
<BR>
<P>According to the Monarch sanctuary website, they enter a biological
<BR>
state during migration to conserve fuel, (2000 miles) so between
<BR>
that and the limitations of their instincts I think large scale
<BR>
avoidance unlikely.
<BR>
<P>Don't let the facts get in the way though.....
