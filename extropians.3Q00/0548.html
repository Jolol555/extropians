<EM>&gt; The target is in the air.  So far its tied, red team 1, blue team 1.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Intercept in about 12 minutes.  Stay tuned...  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>This test has been over for 30 minutes as I write this, and yet with all
<BR>
of our modern technology, with the great Internet that is supposed to make
<BR>
information available at our fingertips, I can't find out the results.
<BR>
<P>CNN.com doesn't have it.  Space.com doesn't have it.  Spike wrote the
<BR>
above message over 30 minutes ago.  He hasn't heard, either.
<BR>
<P>I'm impatient.  I want the news as it happens, when it happens.
<BR>
<P>There are people who know the answer.  They could be making the data
<BR>
available.  But we have to wait.
<BR>
<P>This isn't the first time.  During the big meteor shower last year, the
<BR>
sites which were supposed to have up-to-the-minute reports were sometimes
<BR>
SIX HOURS out of date.  Some of the JPL releases (like the first Face on
<BR>
Mars pic) have not been made available on mirror sites despite promises
<BR>
that those sites would have the data simultaneously with the main site.
<BR>
<P>Granted, this is all new technology.  But it can't be that hard to post
<BR>
a short message with the results, and to make it widely available.
<BR>
<P>I hope that we will see an increase in professionalism and a recognition
<BR>
that timeliness of data is something that people value.  A site which
<BR>
can make breaking news available as it happens will have significant
<BR>
advantages.
