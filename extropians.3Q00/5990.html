<EM>&gt; &gt; A slow singularity posits that long before this occurs,

<EM>&gt; &gt; there will be a long gradual phase of human augmentation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technology development, where people add more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capabilities to their own minds, to some eventual point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; where their original bodies may die and they do not even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; notice, as the wetware/meatware part of their being has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; become such a small percentage of their actual selves. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; personally am betting on this occuring, and not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; punctuated equilibrium that others seem to think will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; occur with a fast singularity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eventually everything goes to hell anyway and one has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonder what you preserve of your self when you enter the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Singularity, since by definition you come out the other side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as something you can't possibly comprehend.
</EM><BR>
<P>It may be something that I cannot comprehend *right now*, however if you
<BR>
followed the Vinge singularity discussion archived at extropy, look at my
<BR>
diagram of the participant's eye view of the singularity, and you will see that
<BR>
as long as I maintain a continuity of me-ness, I know that it will be, in fact,
<BR>
me that will eventually comprehend the singularity as I pass through it.
<BR>
<P>Things 'go to hell' only in the eyes of those observing from a point stuck in
<BR>
stasis, as their comprehension of events unravels as they unfold. To the
<BR>
participant riding the wave, comprehension is maintained throughout.
