<EM>&gt; Just a few thoughts:  The other night I accidentally tuned in to &quot;Red
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dwarf.&quot;  The computer convinced one of the characters to erase part of its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;memory.&quot;  Problem was that it had read every single book ever written -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposedly stored in its &quot;library&quot; - and was bored.  So it wanted all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agathe Christy novels erased so that it could have the pleasure of reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question: What is the precise difference between having the novels in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;memory&quot; and in &quot;storage?&quot;  Presumably the computer could access the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information in the library via any number of algorythmic searches or even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spawn intelligent agents to do more sophisticated access to the actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; informational content and meaning.  What additional factor is involved in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually reading it that isn't present in intelligent transclusion?
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, for the computer, intelligent transclusion *is* &quot;reading&quot; the
<BR>
book.  Given the attitude of the builders of the ship Red Dwarf (for
<BR>
humans, by humans - perfectly understandable, given that at the start of
<BR>
RD, the Singularity is still a ways away), it makes sense that the
<BR>
library would be stored as, say, ASCII text English.  The AI's memory
<BR>
must be in some other format, if only because ASCII text English is
<BR>
unsuitable for perfectly representing the memory of a sentient being.
<BR>
The computer was apparently made to think of itself as similar to a
<BR>
human, so it could well use the metaphor of &quot;reading&quot; something by
<BR>
translating text into whatever format its memory uses.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In terms related to uploading, what would be the difference between my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moving the library of congress - or just a single book - into my RAM or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equivalent and my actually &quot;reading&quot; the material in question?
</EM><BR>
<P>The side effects.  Wear and tear on the book, transportation to/from the
<BR>
LOC, temporary inavailability of the material to other patrons of the
<BR>
LOC, memory of having done one process or the other, and so forth
<BR>
(probably including a siimilar litany for side effects of translating it
<BR>
into your RAM, depending on how that is implemented).  And this is
<BR>
assuming your auto-reading software (which translates from text to your
<BR>
memory format) perfectly duplicates whatever nuances you'd interpret the
<BR>
book with when &quot;actually&quot; reading it.  (Which is unlikely since the
<BR>
book's contents would presumably go through a faster - and thus,
<BR>
presumably different - path to get to your memory, unless the paths are
<BR>
specifically engineerd to produce identical results.  Unless the
<BR>
differences are detrimental to your use of the contents - which is
<BR>
probably true of imperfect &quot;learned&quot; skills like reading - then why
<BR>
would you want to duplicate the nuances - and bugs - of the &quot;natural&quot;
<BR>
approach exactly?)
