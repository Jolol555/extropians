Partnerships operate differently from corporations; the distinction goes 
<BR>
beyond mere labels.  Most notably, for present purposes, each owner of a 
<BR>
partnership (i.e., each partner) shares an equal right to control the 
<BR>
business organization.  Someone who merely contributes money would probably 
<BR>
not qualify as a partner.  He/she would more likely qualify as a creditor.  
<BR>
The sole proprietor, in contrast, has such a right and, correspondingly, a 
<BR>
responsibility for the firm's liabilities.

it

<EM>&gt;  destroying several nearby buildings.  Ditto for sole proprietorships where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the sole proprietor hires a manager to run things.  If you don't agree,

what
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  gives corporations special status here?
