<P><EM> &gt; Well then, what do you propose as a method of insuring that AIs
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; remain friendly?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know of any. The only thing which may work is not to build
<BR>
evolutionary-algorithms utilizing AIs until we have mature
<BR>
uploads. Putting brakes on the speed of the transition, hauling as
<BR>
many low-fitness folks as we can in the higher-fitness regime, before
<BR>
releasing the brakes, and speeding off. Hopefully, somebody of these
<BR>
folks will take care of the diverse endangered species (Amish &amp; Co),
<BR>
orelse they're just going to go extinct.
<BR>
<P>Relinquishment doesn't work, at least not sustainably, but speeding up
<BR>
some things while inhibiting another might save our ass in the
<BR>
end. (The emphasis is on *might*). As always, I welcome less brittle
<BR>
solutions.
