<EM>&gt; You see, I see this country (USA) as our property; it's our asset. We all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derive our living from it. The benefits from our work here accrue to us (in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large part).
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you need to add much more clarification to this concept.  What does
<BR>
it mean that the USA is our property?  What parts of the USA?  The land?  Are
<BR>
you saying that my land belongs collectivelly to the people of the US?  Or
<BR>
do you just mean the businesses?  My company is owned by everyone else?
<BR>
<P>Then you suggest that if someone comes here and works, they're stealing
<BR>
my property?  What exactly are they stealing?  Suppose some guy stands on
<BR>
the other side of the border and makes a basket, and I buy it from him.
<BR>
He is still stealing?  I don't see how it can become stealing simply if
<BR>
he steps over the border before making his basket.
<BR>
<P>Even if you could come up with a principled reason to oppose immigration
<BR>
(were your own immigrant ancestors stealing, BTW?), would it still follow
<BR>
that implanted IDs are a good idea?  Wouldn't you have to consider the
<BR>
costs and disadvantages of that technology before jumping in and saying
<BR>
that it is good?
