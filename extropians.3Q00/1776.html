<EM>&gt; &gt; In a discussion in another forum, the question of whether computers have

<P>Greg, in 1981 I was working for the math department at college
<BR>
as a tutor and coder grunt for the HP3000.  The university bought
<BR>
a new PDP11-750 and disbursed funds to each of the department
<BR>
heads to purchase software.  Every major immediately found suitable
<BR>
software except one, and it wasnt the Home Economics {for they
<BR>
immediately put into practice the canonical home application touted
<BR>
in 1980, putting recipes on the home computer}.  The one college
<BR>
that was nearly at a loss to figure out how to use a computer was...
<BR>
mathematics.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>They finally bought a few lame programs, something like a very
<BR>
feeble precursor to what we would now call mathematica, a still more
<BR>
feeble precursor to modern spreadsheets, and some modelling/
<BR>
visualization software that was actually pretty decent.
<BR>
<P>And that, young people, was how it was in those days.  spike
