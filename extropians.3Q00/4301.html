<EM>&gt; &gt; Nice to quibble over such things, but how should citizenship be
</EM><BR>
conferred?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And should noncitizens be subject to the government, if one believes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government with the consent of the governed?  (If one does not, that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; another story.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While one could say that the nation having an open immigration policy with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regard to outgoing traffic, anyone who doesn't leave is consenting to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governed by those in charge, i.e. the old 'voting with their feet' gambit.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  But, again, if you are willing to go down this road, I suppose,
<BR>
then, you support every policy of all ruling cliques in Washington and
<BR>
Laconia during your lifetime.  Well, do you?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy seems to work within the 50 states, as the various state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments tend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to get distressed if there is a high rate of taxpayers leaving their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state for greener pastures (unless, of course, those leaving tend to be of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; welfare class). Thus a non-citizen who stays here, when they could leave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any time, is in actuality consenting to be taxed.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem would be, here, the need for that sort of policy on the national
<BR>
level too.  It also doesn't work if, say, you're for polygamy and all fifty
<BR>
states are against it.  Or if the central government decides to tax
<BR>
everyone, which it currently does.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Taxing a non-citizen 'legally' could take many forms, for example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imposing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expatriation tariffs on money sent by non-citizens out of the country to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relatives elsewhere would not be a direct tax on their income, but on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their 'gift' to others.
</EM><BR>
<P>But all of these are mere legal niceities.  They do not speak to the spirit
<BR>
of government by consent of the governed.  They merely set up euphamisms to
<BR>
ease consciences.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Additionally, the INS does tend to encourage resident aliens who are
</EM><BR>
productive
<BR>
<EM>&gt; taxpayers to become citizens. Sasha, for example, had told me he was
</EM><BR>
debating
<BR>
<EM>&gt; becoming a citizen for a few years, but was unsure the potential tax
</EM><BR>
advantages
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of remaining in his current position (since he had been exiled from the
</EM><BR>
USSR,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; which no longer existed, he was actually not a citizen of any country,
</EM><BR>
which I'm
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sure drove the INS to distraction, as they would have no place to deport
</EM><BR>
him to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; if he ever became a liability, and bureaucrats hate quantum people.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I was under the belief that deportation was to wherever one arrived from.
<BR>
Perhaps I'm wrong here...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But Thomas does care.  Note how before he was appointed, he was very
</EM><BR>
much
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for Natural Law, but during the appointment process he turned into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pragmatist very quickly.  I guess his avowed principles were only so
</EM><BR>
much
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; window dressing.  (Or, if he's returned to them, they are only to be
</EM><BR>
held
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; when they are convenient.)  This tells me he is not independent minded.
</EM><BR>
He
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just caters to a different audience than the NAACP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know where you get any of this. What is your rationale for this
</EM><BR>
claim?
<BR>
<P>Didn't you watch the hearings?
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
