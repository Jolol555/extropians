'Anti-age' drug found
<BR>
<P>Anti-ageing research might one-day lead to a fitter and longer retirement
<BR>
<P>For the first time, scientists have succeeded in boosting an animal's life 
<BR>
span with drugs. 
<BR>
Microscopic worms given the therapy lived nearly 50% longer than normal. 
<BR>
<P>The researchers say the experiments are the first real indication that ageing 
<BR>
can be treated. 
<BR>
<P>They believe the drugs might be useful for combating human diseases that 
<BR>
strike in later life. 
<BR>
<P>Clinical trials for disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
<BR>
could take place in the near future. 
<BR>
<P>'Youthful and active' 
<BR>
<P>&quot;As far as we know, this is the first convincing example of drugs being used 
<BR>
to extend life span,&quot; said Dr Gordon Lithgow of the University of Manchester, 
<BR>
UK, who carried out the research along with colleagues in the United States. 
<BR>
<P>He said the drugs had an anti-ageing effect on the worms. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The treated worms appear youthful and active at the same time as when the 
<BR>
untreated worms are showing the characteristics of old age,&quot; he told BBC News 
<BR>
Online. 
<BR>
<P>The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans was used in the studies.

<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This tiny creature has been studied in the laboratory for many years. The 
<BR>
first living thing to have its genetic blueprint decoded, around 40% of the 
<BR>
worm's genes are also found in humans. 
<BR>
<P>The scientists added a cocktail of two synthetic drugs to the medium in which 
<BR>
the worms, when kept in the laboratory, live and reproduce. 
<BR>
<P>Both of the drugs are antioxidants. They mimic the effect of natural enzymes 
<BR>
that mop up free radicals - highly reactive molecules that damage cells. 
<BR>
<P>When given the drugs, the worms lived on average nearly 50% longer than 
<BR>
normal. 
<BR>
<P>Fighting free radicals 
<BR>
<P>The reason, the scientists believe, is that the drugs prevented free radical 
<BR>
damage. 
<BR>
<P>Other experts say the research is interesting but must be duplicated in 
<BR>
creatures other than the worm. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The idea that antioxidants might have an effect [on ageing] has been around 
<BR>
for quite a long time,&quot; said Professor David White, director of science at 
<BR>
the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, UK, which is 
<BR>
funding research into the science of ageing. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;It seems to have a dramatic effect in worms,&quot; he added. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Whether it will have the same effect in other organisms will have to be 
<BR>
established.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The research is published in the journal, Science.
