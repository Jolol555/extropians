From: Paul Hughes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:paul@planetp.cc?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Why%20I'm%20boycotting%20Extropy(TM)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009071438.HAA11527@well.com&gt;">paul@planetp.cc</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Please keep in mind I have never called extropians fascists - I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was simply echoing the sentiments of others.  As most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people I'm referring to also share many of our extropian goals,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they have every right to question you back when you're advocating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that all civil rights protections become commodities up for sale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the highest bidder.  I don't think I would be out of line by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;saying that the extreme version of free-markets being advocated in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these circles is nothing short of a full-blown Piracy!
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not a &quot;faith&quot; that I adhere to, and I would not be
<BR>
surprised if this is actually a minority view here. Why not put
<BR>
together a survey that list members can complete, and then we will
<BR>
have some facts on the matter?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;And what utterly befuddles me is why people are either gleeful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about that fact that the poor get screwed or at best refuse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;admit their is a problem, or &quot;Things will just work out, trust me,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have faith&quot;.  And yet ironically, I'm the one being accused of not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debating this rigorously.  I should have added to my list rampant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hypocrisy as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I think we have very different views on why poor people
<BR>
are poor. You seem to think the poor are being screwed by somebody,
<BR>
and myself and I believe a number of others, believe the poor are
<BR>
poor largely because they tend to make bad decisions. These
<BR>
decisions are largely the result of ignorance.
