<BR>
<EM>&gt; Emlyn, I've tried to reduce your argument to its essence so we can focus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this discussion as tightly as possible. You wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Don't get me wrong; I don't oppose any of the technologies being
</EM><BR>
developed.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I take issue only with the top level goals in some cases. Particularly,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;goal of godhood leads to an arrogance which I can't condone. It leads to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;believing that you know better than the other six billion people kicking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;around on this planet, and that can direct actions which are not morally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;supportable; for instance, the attempt to build a guardian - I haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;noticed any step in the plans for such creations, which involves
</EM><BR>
obtaining
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;broad consensus before &quot;flicking the switch&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You are defining godhood as authority presumptively assumed by a powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am defining godhood as the result of empowering technologies that thrust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; godly levels of responsibility upon us. We want to achieve every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transhumanist potential we can, and a by-product of doing so is that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become like the gods of myth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>We will never be gods. Just fallible creatures with better tools. I've got
<BR>
no problem with that (go the fallible creatures, go the better tools!), but
<BR>
you can't justify attributing godhood to that.
<BR>
<P>I'm having trouble with this line of argument; maybe I'm full of it (quite
<BR>
probably). I'll try a slightly different tack...
<BR>
<P>Why do you want to be a God (amongst other gods, as you have noted). What
<BR>
benefit do you see in it? What will you do with godhood?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've dealt with the issue of guardians in a previous post. &quot;Who guards the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guardians?&quot; is still the operant concern. You are worried that someone
</EM><BR>
might
<BR>
<EM>&gt; create an AI guardian (or perhaps augment themselves to become a
</EM><BR>
Transhuman
<BR>
<EM>&gt; guardian) without first seeking consensus or permission. I understand why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you would be worried about this, given humanity's checkered history,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially in the 20th century, of bloody dictators and their cults of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personality. Yet I see no way to prevent any sufficiently bright,
</EM><BR>
determined
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and capitalized person from doing what you fear. What to do?
</EM><BR>
<P>Promote a culture of trust of each other, of individual humility combined
<BR>
with a belief in the ability of humanity to rise above all challenges.
<BR>
Promote rationality/rational thinking. Promote self reliance, and encourage
<BR>
self confidence in all people. Don't crap on other people.
<BR>
<P>I think that might just reduce the available pool of the bewildered and
<BR>
confused, and limit the ability of the self important to lead the majority
<BR>
astray. It might also reduce the high tolerance people seem to have, on
<BR>
average, for allowing small numbers of other people to make their decisions
<BR>
for them.
<BR>
<P>If people are going to gain the confidence to make their own decisions,
<BR>
they'll also need information. So I guess we need to free information,
<BR>
although I'd say this one's taking care of itself.
<BR>
<P>I was about to say a bunch of stuff about the &quot;God meme&quot;, but I think it
<BR>
might be a crock. The central problem is in having no useful definition of
<BR>
&quot;God meme&quot;. I think I'll stop using the word &quot;meme&quot;, it implies an exact
<BR>
object which isn't realistic when you talk about ideas. And about the
<BR>
concept of God, I think the definition being used all depends on why you (or
<BR>
any other transhumanists) want to become Gods (as opposed, say, really
<BR>
rather powerful beings who are not human any more, but are not Gods). I've
<BR>
already asked that question above.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Also, we are playing with fire...&lt;snip&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We should fight fire with fire. If we cannot prevent anyone else from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; achieving godly levels of power and abusing that achievement, then WE must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strive to achieve it and use it rightly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Rightly? How so?
<BR>
<P>- Other people might abuse godly power - they are the bad guys
<BR>
- We will not abuse godly power - we are the good guys
<BR>
- Corollary: We must &quot;manage&quot; the overall distribution of godly power,
<BR>
because that is our responsibility as good guys. This involves, but is not
<BR>
limited to, a characteristically godly level of smiting.
<BR>
<P>Humility is mostly about remembering that there is a slim chance that, just
<BR>
maybe, you might be the person who is wrong after all. Or maybe there are
<BR>
elements of truth on all sides. Or maybe everyone is entirely off the mark.
<BR>
<P>Godhood, on the other hand, means never having to say you're sorry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It's been discussed on the list just how dangerous some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;coming technologies are (ai, nanotech, etc), and if you go over the
</EM><BR>
posts,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you'll see that most of the danger is attributed to use of that
</EM><BR>
technology
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;by humans infected with the God meme. People who think that they know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;than everyone else, who feel justified in producing externalities (like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;goo).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The God meme was not behind the monumental crimes against humanity
</EM><BR>
committed
<BR>
<EM>&gt; by the Communists and Nazis. Quite the opposite, in fact. What you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually worried about is the human capacity for evil. Evil acts are
</EM><BR>
always
<BR>
<EM>&gt; justified by appealing to whatever meme is most handy, whether that is
</EM><BR>
&quot;the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; people&quot; or &quot;the race&quot; or &quot;God.&quot; Eliminate your fixation on the God meme,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substitute human evil for it within your argument, and it appears that
</EM><BR>
your
<BR>
<EM>&gt; concerns (and presumed solution) becomes essentially the same as Bill
</EM><BR>
Joy's.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Am I correct about that? Do you think we should relinquish AI, nanotech,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic engineering? Or am I not presenting your ideas correctly?
</EM><BR>
<P>I wrote:
<BR>
&quot;Don't get me wrong; I don't oppose any of the technologies being
<BR>
developed.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I don't think I can be any clearer than that. I'll be more positive; I
<BR>
support developing all the technologies available, unless there is a really
<BR>
clear reason not too. Like I might not support genetically modified giant
<BR>
spiders, or advertising via nanotech robots that travel through food and
<BR>
scribble inane slogans on your retina. Or half human/half frog &quot;humfrogs&quot;
<BR>
that would jump around, munching flies in otherwise respectable eating
<BR>
establishments, cracking the pavement with their giant hopping, and
<BR>
devaluing local property prices. Maybe I am a luddite; harrumph.
<BR>
<P>You are quite right in your assessment that not all grubby behaviour can be
<BR>
attributed to the godly (although I was under the impression that the Nazis
<BR>
had some kind of spiritual element which helped define their top-level
<BR>
goals). And on the converse, quite a lot of good has come from the religious
<BR>
world in the past.
<BR>
<P>However, I am unconvinced of the benefits of (following/striving
<BR>
for/assuming the status of) gods in the future. The path we are taking is
<BR>
decidedly secular; our technologies are not divine gifts, they are strictly
<BR>
human creations. There is no sign that this will change any time soon (or
<BR>
any time at all!).
<BR>
<P>Striving for excellence is excellent. Where's the room for
<BR>
spirituality/mysticism/religosity? Why do we need it? Does it benefit us to
<BR>
add it? What price do we pay?
<BR>
