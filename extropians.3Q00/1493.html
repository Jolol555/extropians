Not the Holy Grail of -- Biology -- Mapping Our Genomes May Lead
<BR>
to Battles About Use of The Findings

The announcement of a rough draft of the human  genome could
<BR>
be a moment for celebrating our common humanity.     
<BR>
By Alexander Morgan Capron  
<BR>
<P>The announcement that a rough draft of the human genome has been
<BR>
deciphered has created enormous excitement among scientists.
<BR>
Still, this isn't yet what some have termed &quot;biology's Holy Grail,&quot;
<BR>
but just the beginning of trying to understand both what the
<BR>
3 billion units of DNA that make up the human genome do and the
<BR>
legal, social and personal implications of the genome model.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
The metaphor &quot;human genetic blueprint&quot; that many gene mappers
<BR>
use to describe their findings suggests the fundamental misconception
<BR>
that a genetic map can foretell what an individual will be like,
<BR>
just as those talented at reading architectural blueprints can
<BR>
visualize what the finished building will look like. However,
<BR>
knowing a person's DNA won't provide such foreknowledge. In and
<BR>
of themselves, genes have no meaning. They matter only as they
<BR>
function in living organisms, where their effects depend on the
<BR>
environment.  
<BR>
<P>The most fanciful version of this genes-determine-all philosophy
<BR>
is the view that, in the future, to know a person, all you'll
<BR>
need is a computer disk spelling out the DNA of that person's
<BR>
genome . However, genetic determinism is not merely scientifically
<BR>
false but, if translated into social policy or absorbed into
<BR>
popular thought, horribly destructive to mankind and society.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
In the past several decades, it has become increasingly clear
<BR>
that human capabilities are malleable much longer after childhood
<BR>
than had previously been thought. Even more striking, genetically
<BR>
identical animals exposed to the same laboratory conditions can
<BR>
differ greatly (for example, in life span), apparently randomly.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
Nonetheless, we have a long and very sad history of exaggerating
<BR>
the importance of genetics. In the early years of the last century,
<BR>
eugenics programs were adopted across the United States based
<BR>
on the view that certain people were &quot;unfit&quot; and should be prevented
<BR>
or discouraged from reproducing. The characteristics that were
<BR>
said to have genetic causes, such as larceny and &quot;thalassophilia&quot;
<BR>
(love of the sea), may sound ridiculous today, but it would be
<BR>
a mistake to attribute the problem back then to just bad science.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
The Nazi excesses so discredited state-run eugenics programs
<BR>
that we may think ourselves immune to repeating such blatant
<BR>
genetic determinism. Yet milder forms may still prove to be seductive
<BR>
alternatives to the frustrations we face in trying both to understand
<BR>
the causes of our social problems and to marshal the resources
<BR>
to ameliorate them. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
How tempting then to dismiss such efforts as unnecessary and
<BR>
to focus instead on a &quot;genetic instruction book&quot; for mankind
<BR>
or, more pointedly, for certain subgroups rather than grappling
<BR>
with poverty, poor schools, dirty environments and lack of opportunity.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Nor will the misuse of genetic information be limited to the
<BR>
government. If anything, the gathering and use of genetic data
<BR>
will be easier for employers, insurers and other private parties.
<BR>
And who is going to distinguish between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; genes?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
Unlike other health-related information, a genetic finding about
<BR>
one person has direct implications about the genes of his or
<BR>
her relatives. Since the mapping of the human genome will produce
<BR>
new treatments much more slowly than we can discover disease-predisposing
<BR>
genes, the major effect of the Human genome Project could be
<BR>
that certain groups will be exposed to discrimination based on
<BR>
their newly discovered genes. Of course, such worries could have
<BR>
the opposite effect of stimulating better protection for medical
<BR>
records as well as prompt health care reform to ensure that no
<BR>
one lacks adequate coverage. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The findings from the genome -mapping project could have another
<BR>
great benefit: helping to overthrow our long preoccupation with
<BR>
the issue of &quot;race.&quot; The accumulating human genome data reinforce
<BR>
the scientific conclusion that what we think of as race is entirely
<BR>
a social construct. Certain superficial characteristics, such
<BR>
as hair and skin, are associated with geographic origins, but
<BR>
people in groups that are differentiated along these lines are
<BR>
indistinguishable when most other genes are examined. Indeed,
<BR>
the range of genetic variation is greater within such population
<BR>
groups than between them.  
<BR>
<P>The idea of &quot;racial purity,&quot; as exemplified in the Balkans today
<BR>
or in statutes designed to limit immigration of the eastern and
<BR>
southern European &quot;races&quot; in the early 1900s, has no basis in
<BR>
genetics. The announcement that a rough draft of the human genome
<BR>
is now in hand could thus be a moment for celebrating our common
<BR>
humanity.  
<BR>
<P>And it is also a time to remember that our DNA is just the starting
<BR>
point. Our lives don't emerge according to a predestined path
<BR>
but develop in unpredictable ways based on the advantages and
<BR>
obstacles we face and the choices we make individually, in our
<BR>
families and as a community.
