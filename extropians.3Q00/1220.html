<P><EM>&gt; &gt;One thing that has always troubled me is: if non-coding regions are so easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to mutate and lose, how come they exist in such large amounts? I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;recall in detail my classes on the subject but I don't remember studying 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;DNA repair mechanisms specific of coding regions. Perhaps they exist but,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;until further evidence, I cannot accept them.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From &quot;DNA Repair &amp; Mutagenesis&quot;, E. C. Freidberg et al, 1995, pg  216:
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Studies first carried out with mammalian cells demonstrated that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nucleotide excision repair of DNA occurs preferentially in actively
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transcribed genes (see Chapters 7 &amp; 8).  A similar phenomenon has
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been demonstrated in E. Coli, for which it has been shown that in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;actively transcribed DNA nucelotide excision repair has a pronounced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bias for the transcribed strand.&quot;
<BR>
<P>It goes on to discuss the involvement of the UVR proteins and the
<BR>
&quot;Transcription-repair coupling factor&quot; (mfd gene).
<BR>
<P>Non-coding regions are easy to mutate, but difficult to lose.
<BR>
There is little selective pressure to minimize your DNA (I once
<BR>
thought there might be in birds, because their genomes are smaller
<BR>
and decreased weight could be a survival promoting factor, but
<BR>
the mass of the DNA in a body is so small, I am now doubtful
<BR>
that it could contribute very much).  Though in writing this,
<BR>
I could see an advantage to decreased DNA if you had to develop
<BR>
faster (less copying of unrequired DNA means cell division can
<BR>
proceed more quickly).
<BR>
<P>The reason I think, that there are so many non-coding regions,
<BR>
is because of the selective advantage (to the genes) for taking
<BR>
preexisting &quot;working protein fragments&quot; and inserting them
<BR>
into other genes.  This is the work of the retrotransposons
<BR>
and is why we have so much junk DNA -- it speeds up the
<BR>
acceleration of evolution significantly beyond what simple
<BR>
mutations of individual bases will do.  There are many
<BR>
examples of junk DNA and non-working pseudo-genes that
<BR>
show that species can tolerate a very sloppy job of editing.
<BR>
On the other hand I only know of at most 4 examples where
<BR>
cutting and splicing DNA may be very accurate:
<BR>
(VDJ recombination in immune cells, the CRE/LOX genes
<BR>
in yeast, perhaps the activation of individual smell
<BR>
receptor proteins in individual neurons and maybe
<BR>
the insertion of adeno-associated virus).  This is
<BR>
separate from the mechanism of homologous recombination
<BR>
that always trys to put things back together in their
<BR>
original form.  In short, random jumping DNA is easy
<BR>
while specific splicing of DNA seems pretty difficult.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just a thought..  Suppose the introns, etc. are used for identification 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes?  Like a fingerprint.  I wonder if they could figure into viral 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense?
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt it.  I think the introns are just the leftovers
<BR>
of the evolutionary process.  Nature doesn't care much
<BR>
for how much it has to throw away, so long as it gets
<BR>
better results in the end.  As a result the work is
<BR>
pretty sloppy.
<BR>
<P>Paraphrasing Venter, &quot;In looking at the genome, you can tell
<BR>
it wasn't designed by a human&quot; (when asked whether he believed
<BR>
in God).
