<EM>&gt;New Scientist has an interview with Igor Aleksander of Imperial College,

<EM>&gt;London about his new book &quot;How to build a Mind&quot;. From this interview it

<EM>&gt;seems as though there are several groups around the world working in this

<EM>&gt;area.

<P>Interesting. I suspect his title was inspired by John Pollock's (or is it 
<BR>
&quot;Pollack's&quot;?) book, &quot;How to Build a Person&quot;. I remember Pollock from the 
<BR>
time he came to speak at USC on his work. He wanted a joint appointment in 
<BR>
Philosophy and Computer Science, but apparently got a better offer elsewhere.
<BR>
<P>I've had a copy of Igor Aleksander's previous book, but it's say on my 
<BR>
shelf unread for about 15 years. Has anyone read it? (I think it's called 
<BR>
&quot;Reinventing Man&quot;).
<BR>
<P>Onward!
