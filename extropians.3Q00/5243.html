<EM>&gt; Actually, what Samantha describes is what is known as a hypnogogic trance, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same sort of phenomenon that is now thought to trigger sleepwalking, OOB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiences, and alien abduction experiences (which used to be thought of as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visitations from the eldritch fairies). It has more, I think, to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; narcolepsy than epilepsy (having had two rather odd experiences myself once, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being a known narcoleptic from excessive caffiene use (its an odd allergy, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only comes up when I am taking about a half a pack a day of no-doze).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  Hypnagogic trance is quite a bit different in the
<BR>
literature I've read.  There are also many different facets to
<BR>
sleepwaling, OOB and alien abduction stuff.  I don't think you can lump
<BR>
all three together fully and certainly not under &quot;hypnagogic trance&quot;.
<BR>
Especially since hypnagogic effects are part of everyone's sleep cycle. 
<BR>
The experience I and others have described is not at all like being in a
<BR>
trance condition.  I have never experienced these other effects and as
<BR>
far as I know am not prone to any of them.
