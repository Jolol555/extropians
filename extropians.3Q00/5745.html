Robin Hanson writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The easiest response is to deny the maxim.  If wealth = power, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fact that we are a lot richer than our ancestors, but not a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more corrupt, suggests that wealth-power does not corrupt.  Perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you mean relative wealth = power.  But it is not clear to me that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; richer people tend to be more corrupt.  And even if this were true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cause might go the other way -- corruption tends to acquire power.
</EM><BR>
<P>You've made my day. I've contended for some time that the maxim &quot;power corrupts&quot;
<BR>
is false. The old saw is untrue because power does not change one's character,
<BR>
it only enhances and amplifies it. The truth is that corrupt people are the ones
<BR>
who seek power.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The most dangerous man, to any government, is the man who is able to
<BR>
think things out for himself, without regard to the prevailing
<BR>
superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion
<BR>
that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane and intolerable,
<BR>
and so, if he is romantic, he tries to change it. And even if he is not
<BR>
romantic personally he is very apt to spread discontent among those who
<BR>
are.&quot;
