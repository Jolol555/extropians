<EM>&gt; The L-1011 is my favorite air liner. I used to love to fly on them with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TWA when flying from Seattle to Boston nonstop. The huge legroom that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coach seats had was incredible (wide seats too).
</EM><BR>
<P>Mine too.  Even my modern standards it is a very comfortable aircraft
<BR>
for the long haul.  If you want an interesting discussion of the L1011
<BR>
vs its real competitor the Douglas DC 10, Ben Rich discusses it in his
<BR>
book Skunk Works.  The DC10 had the straight thru tail engine, which
<BR>
forced the rudder to be shorter, which required the wing engines to
<BR>
be closer inboard so that in a one-engine-out condition, the shorter
<BR>
rudder could overcome the resultant yaw.  The L1011 had the more
<BR>
expensive and complicated (Lockheed loves to do things this way
<BR>
whenever possible) S-shaped thrust duct, allowing a longer rudder,
<BR>
allowing the wing engines to be further outboard, so the passenger
<BR>
compartment is quieter.  The company calculated it would need to
<BR>
sell 250 of the 1011s to break even, and it sold 246 if memory
<BR>
serves correctly.  spike
