<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And the stasist wont
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reduce their control, they have already the philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; upmanship. And  without dynamism, we wont have any transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I still don't see why you think that it's impossible to have dynamism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and central planning at the same time. I believe your meaning of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dynamism in this context is &quot;continuous change, activity, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;progress; vigor&quot;. How is that incompatible with a centralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decision-making process and the concentration of resources to attain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;specified goals? I say that both centralism and individualism can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;support a dynamic culture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For example; the Manhattan project in the 1940's and the Apollo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;program in the 1960's are both splendid examples of centrally-planned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;top-down technological innovation that had widespread social impact.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Especially in the sort of economy that we enjoy today, to repeat the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;success of a &quot;lone genius&quot; such as Edison would be next to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impossible. The rare exceptions have almost always soon turned into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large centrally-planned bureaucracies (Microsoft, for example).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, you've essentialy accepted the Technocratic Great Narrative. 
<BR>
Ultimately, it will make you abandon transhumanism as impractical, since it 
<BR>
is an ultimately stasist viewpoint.
<BR>
<P>It is not my task to give you a lesson on how economic growth and innovation 
<BR>
occurs. I can give the name of a good book, &quot;How the West grew rich&quot; by 
<BR>
Rosenberg.
<BR>
<P>The point is that my text was just a quick resumé of Virginia Postrels book 
<BR>
&quot;The future and its enemies&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I posted it intentionally to prove a hypothesis of mine. That even Postrel 
<BR>
would be to &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;weird&quot; for transhumanists. Kind of depends on 
<BR>
what people that get attracted to transhumanism today, and how little 
<BR>
intellectual work that's going on. Unfortunately, I think that transhumanism 
<BR>
has in many respects stagnated. Where is the transhumanist Virgina Postrel 
<BR>
(because she's not even a transhumanist)? I haven't seen him/her. Who asks 
<BR>
the controversial questions of the future in transhumanism? Who constructs a 
<BR>
transhumanist paradigm?
<BR>
<P>It shows that transhumanism hasn't developed a real philosophy. Good 
<BR>
foundations were laid, but the essential work of developing them into a good 
<BR>
ideology weren't maid.
<BR>
<P>And really, if transhumanism is just an unintellectual varity of the present 
<BR>
technocratic views, why should people bother?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(And as an aside, central planning and resource concentration do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessarily imply statism or coersion by force. It is perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possible to willingly follow a common dream, to become part of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;greater whole, without being forced to do so at gunpoint.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I disagree that libertarian-style rugged individualism is required
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for a dynamic, ever-progressing society. That may well be the premise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of Extropianism, but be so kind as to not foist your neo-anarchy on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all of transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<P>But transhumanism is then just turning into the dust bin of extropianism. It 
<BR>
is the scared &quot;NO!&quot;, the &quot;not extropian&quot;, to at least the small amount of 
<BR>
depth show by extropianism. Want a technocracy? It is transhumanism! Want 
<BR>
UFO:s? It is transhumanism! But what is the transhumanist vision of the 
<BR>
future? It is fluff.
<BR>
<P>If there is no understanding of core conflicts of the future then we have 
<BR>
already lost tomorrow. Because our opponents have got a language, a Great 
<BR>
Narrative, and explanations.
<BR>
<P>So what am I going to do about it?
<BR>
<P>I'm having a vacation!
<BR>
<P>'Cause my uncle John from Jamaica
<BR>
keeps on calling every day
<BR>
Just buy a ticket and fly
<BR>
on a summer holiday
<BR>
<P>Ingdahl
<BR>
<P>Tah- dah, see you in August!
