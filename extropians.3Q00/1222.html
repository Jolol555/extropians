<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure that I agree that the hardware will need to be all that special

<EM>&gt; purpose. You're basically looking at massive massively parallel hardware,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has got to be where hardware is heading in any case.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not completely true.  Programming massive parallelism is not a mainstream
<BR>
application.  Human minds can't think that way so writing the software
<BR>
is very difficult.  I would argue massive parallelism will remain a
<BR>
special purpose application where it is almost always designed as
<BR>
a model or simulation of some real world process (weather, buckytube
<BR>
bending, protein folding, etc.).  Either that or it will be parallelism
<BR>
for doing identical stuff in multi-threads (e.g. web serving).
<BR>
<P>While general purpose hardware can simulate neural nets, to get to the
<BR>
real time or faster time scales that Robin requires, it has to be
<BR>
special purpose (at least currently).  Ultimately it isn't computation
<BR>
the brain is good at, it is evolving clever interconnects.  Almost
<BR>
*all* current hardware devices (transistors, FETs, etc) and communications
<BR>
protocols are not optimal for brain architectures.  You need to change
<BR>
1-to-1, 1 to few or 1-to-many strategies into many-to-many.  As
<BR>
interconnected as the entire WWW is today it is still much less
<BR>
than a single human brain.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it more likely that we'll get far faster massively parallel systems (at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheapish prices) first, or that we'll be able to conquer the problems of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high bandwidth connections between human &amp; machine, an area of technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that could barely be said to have hatched?
</EM><BR>
<P>We will have special purpose massively parallel systems (I would love
<BR>
to know what IBM thinks the market for Blue Gene is).  I suspect they
<BR>
will not be particularly cheap (they have to sell 200 @ $1 million each
<BR>
to recover their investment at a decent profit).  We will start with
<BR>
low bandwidth human-machine communications (think of the retraining you
<BR>
do to scribble on a palm-pilot) that will jump significantly when it
<BR>
becomes feasible to implant devices into which neurons can grow
<BR>
that are linked to exo-GHz transceivers (think cell-phone or
<BR>
Borgian exohardware).  With human &quot;eye&quot; &quot;input&quot; and an equivalent
<BR>
optic-nerve sized &quot;output&quot;, you have the foundation for high bandwidth
<BR>
links.
<BR>
<P>So I see them both developing on separate paths, but the market size
<BR>
for the massively parallel hardware is likely to be much smaller than
<BR>
the market for high bandwidth exolinks.  I can't win at Tetris anymore
<BR>
because the keyboard will not respond as fast as I can think.  Think
<BR>
about the protein folding market vs. the game playing market.
