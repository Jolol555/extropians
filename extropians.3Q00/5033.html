<P><EM>&gt;   That is to say, at this point in time, the decision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  whether or not to bear a child should be the mother's, but the father
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  should have the right to veto a decision in favor of bearing the child. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This raises further questions, such as whether the mother should have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  right to override the father's veto if she agrees to waive rights to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  paternal support for the child.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Should? 
<BR>
<P>In the past when this topic has come up most people avoid it. 
<BR>
And... when someone asked if you were being antagonizing, you said no. Yet 
<BR>
this request to legislate pregnancy is along the same lines as asking for 
<BR>
complete gun control.  It is sure to get a rise out of the list. Perhaps the 
<BR>
thread will dwindle soon, since this list is predominantly male and guys 
<BR>
dislike the topic to begin with....
<BR>
<P>I think you're barking up the wrong tree, purely because things cannot be 
<BR>
&quot;your way&quot; unless even more laws are put in place, and we aren't notoriously 
<BR>
the list that is in favor of government regulating women's OR men's human 
<BR>
reproductive organs.
<BR>
<P>I see that you are looking at the future and trying to solve a problem.
<BR>
good luck.
