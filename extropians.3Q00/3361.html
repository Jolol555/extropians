<EM>&gt; Ah yes, but you see Grahss Hopahh, Hebrew calendah not count 240 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when Israel ruled by Phonecians!
</EM><BR>
<P>I vaguely recall that it was 160, or possibly 120, during the time of
<BR>
the Second Temple.
<BR>
<P>The Jews know about this, BTW - maybe not *all* the Jews, but it's an
<BR>
acknowledged fact among those who've heard of it.  The author of the
<BR>
original &quot;Seder Olam&quot; (the calendar calculations) knew that he'd lost
<BR>
track, so he operated on the assumption that the reign of any given king
<BR>
is only as long as the last year mentioned in the documentation; e.g.,
<BR>
if the only thing said about a given kind is that he raised taxes during
<BR>
the third year, it's assumed that he reigned for three years.  In modern
<BR>
times, I think, they went back and refigured the times with the
<BR>
assistance of archaelogy and other nations' calendars.  With that gap
<BR>
covered, there's a complete, calculable timeline from the creation of
<BR>
the Universe around 59xx years ago to modern times.  (I know it's not
<BR>
5980 or 5990, because I once figured the actual calendar and was amused
<BR>
that the controversial - according to some, theologically prohibited -
<BR>
prediction that the world will end in 6000 is actually going to be off
<BR>
by at least a few decades.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; These kinds of practical difficulties are never hard to explain away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by religion incorporated, Spud.  Explanations flow around hard facts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a river past the rocks.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>And despite all of the above, most Orthodox (but non-Ultra-Orthodox
<BR>
Jews) are perfectly aware that the Universe is fifteen billion years
<BR>
old.  And, while claiming to see no dissonance between the two, they
<BR>
will simultaneously attend seminars on how to reconcile the two numbers.
<BR>
<P>*Shrug*.
