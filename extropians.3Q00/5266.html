<EM>&gt; &gt; don't think so. Hypnagogic trance is quite a bit different in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;literature I've read. There are also many different facets to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sleepwaling, OOB and alien abduction stuff. I don't think you can lump
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;all three together fully and certainly not under &quot;hypnagogic trance&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Especially since hypnagogic effects are part of everyone's sleep cycle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The experience I and others have described is not at all like being in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;trance condition. I have never experienced these other effects and as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;far as I know am not prone to any of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can someone give me a good reference for hypnagogic trance, please?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I spent several years in my childhood (7-9) sleep-walking.  I didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that I was in any special trance state. For me, it was part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my nightly sleep. Noone thought very much about it (although it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worried my parents a little during the year my family and I were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; living on our sailboat).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found the following reference to &quot;hypnagogic trance&quot;, but I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know if it is a reputable reference. (I'm skeptical.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Persinger is a very reputable researcher. He is currently working with using
<BR>
electromagnetic harmonics to trigger both abduction 'experiences' AND the sort
<BR>
of experiences others here have described. Most UFO nuts hate him, which is
<BR>
obviously points in his favor to me.
<BR>
<P>While I've never sleep walked, all three of my siblings have had such
<BR>
experiences, and we all talk in our sleep on occasion. Sleep walking and
<BR>
narcolepsy involve abnormal chemistry between the brain and the spinal cord,
<BR>
where normally in sleep neurochemicals inhibit signals from traveling down the
<BR>
spine, directing muscular activity, in sleepwalking and sleep talking this
<BR>
chemical activity is hindered and signals get through. With narcolepsy, this
<BR>
chemical activity occurs during conciousness, causing a narcoleptic seizure that
<BR>
appears to observers to be merely sleep.
