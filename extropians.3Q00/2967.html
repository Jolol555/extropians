<P><EM>&gt; Evangelical Christians will consider [ID implants] an early harbinger of the rule of the Antichrist which they believe is coming.  I will be interested to see to what extent they protest this

<EM>&gt; technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also wonder how fast it well be till tyrannical gov'ts institute this technology by force to closely monitor dissidents?  How much will the world protest this?
</EM><BR>
<P>The notion is that as transparency increases, people are ever more
<BR>
motivated to overthrow tyrannical governments.  If *every* action
<BR>
is open to the light of day, then anything that does not
<BR>
directly harm another person is legal, moral and ethical.  True
<BR>
freedom is not getting away with something that is illegal [but shouldnt be.]
<BR>
True freedom is not having a bunch of stupid laws.
<BR>
<P>Mike Lorrey et.al, think over this deal for a minute.  What if...
<BR>
EVERYTHING that anyone does is visible to everyone.  In
<BR>
return, YOU get to make the laws.  Design a system that will
<BR>
work under those circs, including a means of paying the few
<BR>
cops that will likely still be needed, etc, a prison system for
<BR>
the dangerous few that still desperately need imprisonment, etc.
