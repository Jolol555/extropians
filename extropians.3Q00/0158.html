<EM>&gt;Good point....what are some competetive canidates?

<P>See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.prb.org/pubs/bulletin/bu51-1/intro.htm">http://www.prb.org/pubs/bulletin/bu51-1/intro.htm</A>&gt;:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Seven of the world's wealthiest countries (Germany, France, United 
<BR>
Kingdom, United States, Italy, Japan, and Canada) have about 
<BR>
one-third of the world's migrant population, but less than one-eighth 
<BR>
of the total world population. These countries are also the 
<BR>
destination of most migrants to the industrial world. Because of low 
<BR>
birth rates, newly arriving immigrants account for a large proportion 
<BR>
of population growth in these countries: all the growth in Germany, 
<BR>
for example, and about one-third of the annual growth in the United 
<BR>
States.&quot;
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>&quot;Some analysts argue that the migration challenge is nothing new, and 
<BR>
that it is manageable. They point out that migrants are only 2 
<BR>
percent of the world's population, despite overwhelming demographic, 
<BR>
economic, and political differences that could produce many more 
<BR>
migrants. The number of borders to cross has increased as new 
<BR>
countries are created. The economic links between countries are 
<BR>
stronger because of increased trade. Advances in communications and 
<BR>
transportation have made it easier for potential employers and 
<BR>
employees in different countries to find one another and less 
<BR>
expensive to move. Yet most people stay in their country of birth. 
<BR>
Mexico and the Philippines are two of the world's major 
<BR>
migrant-sending countries, for example, but over 90 percent of the 
<BR>
people born in those two countries still live there.&quot;
