<P>Research Shows Potential Of &quot;Nanojets&quot; For Smaller Circuitry &amp; Injecting 
<BR>
Genes 
<BR>
<P>Liquid jets a few nanometers in diameter could one day be used for producing 
<BR>
ever-smaller electronic circuitry, injecting genes into cells, etching tiny 
<BR>
features and even serving as fuel injectors for microscopic engines. 
<BR>
But on these smallest of size scales, physical processes are often different 
<BR>
than at larger scales, forcing engineers to reconsider both their 
<BR>
expectations of how such nanoscale devices would perform -- and the 
<BR>
established physical equations governing them. 
<BR>
<P>Writing in the August 18 issue of the journal Science, Georgia Institute of 
<BR>
Technology researchers suggest that jets as small as six nanometers in 
<BR>
diameter may be possible to produce, though these tiny devices would require 
<BR>
special conditions to operate and be particularly sensitive to effects not of 
<BR>
concern at more familiar size scales. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;We are now being driven by fundamental, technological and economical 
<BR>
considerations to explore and evaluate systems that are smaller and smaller,&quot; 
<BR>
explained Dr. Uzi Landman, director of Georgia Tech's Center for 
<BR>
Computational Materials Science. &quot;We need to understand these systems, 
<BR>
because basic physics issues are especially important to them. There is no 
<BR>
point in trying to make devices of this size scale without knowing what their 
<BR>
physical behaviors and fundamental limitations are going to be.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>To study jets just a few nanometers in diameter, Landman and collaborator 
<BR>
Michael Moseler used molecular dynamics simulations to observe how some 
<BR>
200,000 propane (C3H8) molecules would behave when compressed within a tiny 
<BR>
reservoir and then injected out of a narrow nozzle made of gold. Operating on 
<BR>
an IBM SP-2 parallel processing computer, the simulations recorded the 
<BR>
dynamics of the fluid molecules on the femtosecond time scale over periods of 
<BR>
several nanoseconds. 
<BR>
<P>The researchers first faced problems producing extended jets from the propane 
<BR>
reservoir, to which they had applied 500 MegaPascals (5,000 Atmospheres) of 
<BR>
pressure. Their simulations suggest that the jet would quickly clog as a film 
<BR>
several molecules thick formed on the outer surface of the nozzle. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;A key to the formation of these jets is fighting certain phenomena that 
<BR>
occur upon exit of the jets from the nozzle,&quot; Landman noted. &quot;Films 
<BR>
condensing on the nozzle exterior surfaces start to thicken and eventually 
<BR>
block further outflow from the nozzle. Such films are not of great concern on 
<BR>
the macroscopic scale, but become key to the ability to form nanoscale jets.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>To counter formation of the films, the researchers heated the outer surface 
<BR>
of the nozzle to evaporate the film. In real-world applications, it may be 
<BR>
possible alternatively to apply a coating that would prevent the propane 
<BR>
molecules from adhering to the outer surface. 
<BR>
<P>Once able to maintain the flow of propane, the researchers studied the 
<BR>
properties of their simulated nanojets. Among the findings: 
<BR>
<P>* Jets exiting from the nozzle into a simulated vacuum achieved a relatively 
<BR>
high velocity of up to 400 meters per second. 
<BR>
<P><P>* Friction of the pressurized fluid moving through the nozzle heats the 
<BR>
propane, turning it to &quot;a very hot fluid.&quot; Upon exit from the nozzle, rapid 
<BR>
evaporation of molecules from the surface cools the jets, reducing their 
<BR>
diameter by about 25 percent. 
<BR>
<P><P>* After exit from the nozzle, instabilities caused by thermal fluctuations 
<BR>
affect the jets' shape. Each jet forms a series of &quot;necks&quot; that cause it to 
<BR>
resemble &quot;links of sausage connected to one another.&quot; Ultimately, one of the 
<BR>
necks &quot;pinches off&quot; and a droplet of propane separates itself from the jet. 
<BR>
<P><P>* The jets remain intact, propagating as a whole over shorter distances than 
<BR>
would macroscopic jets under similar conditions. Landman and Moseler observed 
<BR>
jets extending 150-200 nanometers, in contrast to results of deterministic 
<BR>
Navier-Stokes calculations predicitng 500-nanometer-long jets. These 
<BR>
observations matched the researchers' predictions based on modifications of 
<BR>
the hydrodynamic equations to include the effect of stress fluctuations. 
<BR>
<P><P>* As they break up, the jets form droplets of remarkably uniform size. Noted 
<BR>
Landman: &quot;In applications such as fuel injectors, this is a very important 
<BR>
aspect because of the issue of efficient burning of the droplets.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>In a second phase of their work, the researchers attempted to reconcile the 
<BR>
predictions of traditional fluid dynamics equations -- that is, Navier-Stokes 
<BR>
-- to their observations. They found that these equations did not account for 
<BR>
the effect of thermally-induced fluctuations which significantly affect the 
<BR>
stability of nanojets. These fluctuations are of much less importance at 
<BR>
larger size scales. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;At the small length scale that we are dealing with here, fluctuations become 
<BR>
amplified,&quot; Landman said. &quot;There are always fluctuations or noise in all 
<BR>
natural phenomena. But as the scale of the physical system decreases, then 
<BR>
the amplitude of the relative effect of such fluctuations becomes stronger 
<BR>
and stronger.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Reformulating the hydrodynamic equations allowed Landman and Moseler to 
<BR>
properly describe what they had observed in their atomistic simulations. 
<BR>
Their modified equations can now be used by other researchers to predict the 
<BR>
behavior of nanojets of other materials under other conditions. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;With this fluctuating description, hydrodynamics becomes valid even on the 
<BR>
molecular scale,&quot; Landman said. 
<BR>
<P>In certain real-world applications, the jets would be formed under conditions 
<BR>
where they may collide with molecules in the ambient environment. Such 
<BR>
collisions may somewhat reduce the length of the jets, and cause additional 
<BR>
perturbations, he added. 
<BR>
<P>As a next step, the researchers would like to create nanojets experimentally 
<BR>
and use them to apply patterns that could replace current lithographic 
<BR>
processes in the manufacture of nanoscale miniaturized circuits. They could 
<BR>
potentially also be used as &quot;gene guns&quot; to insert genetic materials into 
<BR>
cells without causing damage. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;They could be very economical and perhaps allow one to achieve things that 
<BR>
are not available technologically any other way,&quot; Landman added.

<BR>
Forshungsgemeinschaft.
