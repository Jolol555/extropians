<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm also optimistic that we'll be able to compile such simulations by

<EM>&gt; &gt; we should be able to throw away most of the irrelevant detail and simulate

<P>Tangled threads here: Robin Hanson is saying that we'll be able to
<BR>
upload relatively early, presumably via a combination of really advanced
<BR>
microtech combined with clever compression of the essential neural data.
<BR>
Hal Finney is saying that you need some sort of reasonably advanced nano
<BR>
to do this sort of thing. Billy Brown goes on to say (in reference to
<BR>
Robin's clever compression):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree. However, that process of learning and incemental improvement will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; almost certainly take several decades if it is done using extensions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current techniques. That makes the resulting brain simulation a 2030 - 2050
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; era technology, vs 2010 - 2030 for basic nanotech manufacturing, sensing and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computing devices. You are correct in that nanotech isn't an essential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prerequisite, in principle, but it seems very likely that simple nanotech will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be availible before any sort of uploading.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is also worth noting that technologies such as neural inerfaces,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence enhancement and sentient AI also look quite plausible in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time frame. The 2010-2050 era is a tangled snarl of possibilities, in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech, AI, IE, neural interfaces and uploading are all likely to appear in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some uncertain order . . .
</EM><BR>
<P>The prospect of &quot;nanotech first&quot; continues to seem plausible to me too,
<BR>
even given the fact that we're probably still quite a way from being
<BR>
able to nanomanufacture *any* large scale product (be it a nano notebook
<BR>
computer, or whatever). For some reason I'm a lot more comfortable with
<BR>
2030 for diamondoid manufacturing of significant &quot;large&quot; (visible to
<BR>
humans) products, than I am with 2010. Just conservative, I guess. I'd
<BR>
note, though, that work on buckytubes is basically headed in that
<BR>
direction -- buckytubes are definitely diamondoid, with lots of the neat
<BR>
properties (high strength, prospects for tailor made shapes for parts)
<BR>
that nano-theorists have talked about.
<BR>
<P>On Robin's ideas about upload economies, I've been interested for quite
<BR>
a while now, however, I don't really see the &quot;uploads first&quot; concept as
<BR>
the most likely outcome. For instance, we could substitute some sort of
<BR>
neural net based &quot;pattern recognizer&quot; robot for the uploads, and have
<BR>
very similar economic potential, particularly if someone is willing to
<BR>
spend lots of money on teams of human teachers to cram the best robot
<BR>
students full of skills and knowledge as rapidly as possible. Once you
<BR>
have even a handful of highly skilled pattern-'bots, then of course you
<BR>
are very likely to be able to copy the software far and wide -- and
<BR>
presumably practically everyone will accept their slave status, if they
<BR>
are &quot;bred&quot; so that their main passion is to study and work.
<BR>
Incidentally, aside from any science fiction references, the essay on
<BR>
this that I am thinking of is a 1993 essay by William H. Calvin (you can
<BR>
probably still find a link to this from Anders Sandberg's pages).
<BR>
<P>Without necessarily trying to develope a lot of detail on why such a
<BR>
pattern-'bot, or &quot;compare to human workalike&quot; should seem plausible,
<BR>
I'll just say that miniaturization generally (and *especially* if that
<BR>
miniaturization leads to nanotech), *should* allow us to imitate natural
<BR>
biological systems, only this time using superior materials for many
<BR>
situations, such as building fake birds, (or ornithopters) from
<BR>
buckytubes, as one possible example. Now the specific thing that William
<BR>
Calvin was thinking of, I believe, was to study human brain development
<BR>
and learn enough about it to imitate the basic process of development in
<BR>
any interesting tech substrates that may come to hand. Thus, we may
<BR>
think about &quot;bucky brains&quot; if you like, or even go back to science
<BR>
fictional &quot;positronic brains&quot; if you want an old-fashioned buzzword for
<BR>
this sort of thing. Imitating, or modeling the embryonic development of
<BR>
animal or human brains surely does sound relatively easy and very
<BR>
scientifically informative, too, compared to picking through the
<BR>
immense, twisted &quot;library&quot; of an adult human brain, and then trying to
<BR>
compactify it as you go?
<BR>
<P>Now in bringing this up, Please Note, I'm not saying this is *easy*,
<BR>
*educating* a robot embryo into something useful could be an intensive
<BR>
effort, along with goodness knows what bio-analog strategies to keep
<BR>
those robo-brains healthy, sane, and motivated to learn things very
<BR>
quickly. As an aside, Isaac Asimov's stories spring to mind, but I
<BR>
really doubt that his idea of Three Laws is going to work -- why should
<BR>
every robot artisan be a human-robot relations lawyer? Asimov *did* have
<BR>
another idea that somehow seems more plausible, though -- in one of his
<BR>
stories the robots find a way to ritualize their work, and worship the
<BR>
perceived Creator of the work. Mightn't this be kind of handy, for 'bots
<BR>
stuck doing the same thing all the time anyway?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, mention of smart 'bots stuck in the same job for long periods,
<BR>
leads me right back around in a circle to something that was mentioned
<BR>
earlier, namely the chance that sophisticated software might be very
<BR>
flexible in doing sophisticated things, even without resembling humans
<BR>
nearly as much as science fictional robots tend to do. So, AI brings up
<BR>
lots of possibilities -- why, one can just positively reel off the
<BR>
possibilities and hardly be original at all, right!
