Hi Everybody,
<BR>
<P>For the last five years, I've been tinkering with one of the most powerful
<BR>
self-metaprogramming tools I've found, known as NLP or Neuro-Linguistic
<BR>
Programming!
<BR>
<P>I can't help but think of the ways that a community as creative and
<BR>
intelligent as Extropians could use NLP in ways to extend life and
<BR>
transform greater!
<BR>
<P>The funny think is that once people reach a certain level of skill with
<BR>
NLP, they almost become Extropianistic, in their behaviors! Many only as a
<BR>
personal level, but most even at a social and technological level. If
<BR>
there are individuals on this list who would like to bring their personal
<BR>
life to the same level of Extropy their mind is at, I welcome you to look
<BR>
at this interesting technology!
<BR>
<P>Are there any other NLPers on this list!?!
<BR>
<P>Please make yourself known, and share your thoughts on
<BR>
Extropianistic-Lingusitic Programming uses!
<BR>
<P>in SMI2LE,
<BR>
<P>- Eric
