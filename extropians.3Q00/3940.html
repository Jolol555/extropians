<EM>&gt; I've heard of NLP before, but don't know anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it... could you please explain?
</EM><BR>
<P>The letters stand for &quot;Neuro Linguistic Programming.&quot;   It began in the
<BR>
mid-1970's as a set of models of the behavior of people who were good at
<BR>
communicating, and techniques that can be used to learn the behavior of
<BR>
the experts.  It may have evolved into something different by now--I
<BR>
studied it in the mid-1980's.  
<BR>
<P>The models and techniques were developed  by Richard Bandler and John (?)
<BR>
Grinder (I think) who set out to model the beavior of
<BR>
communication-geniuses.  Among the people whose behavior they modeled
<BR>
were hypnotherapist Milton Erickson, gestalt therapist Fritz Perls and
<BR>
family therapist Virginia Satir.  I've seen videos of Erickson and Satir
<BR>
and was quite impressed with their communications skills.
<BR>
<P>There are a couple of things I especially  like about NLP:  first, the
<BR>
techniques work; second, the approach is lighthearted and optimistic and
<BR>
respects the individual.  Here are some of the basic assumptions:
<BR>
<P>No one is wrong or broken. 
<BR>
Behind every behavior is a positive intention. 
<BR>
Every behavior is useful in some context. 
<BR>
The meaning of a communication is the response you get. 
<BR>
If you aren't getting the response you want, do *something* different. 
<BR>
There is no such thing as failure. There is only feedback. 
<BR>
In any system, the element with the most flexibility exerts the most
<BR>
influence. 
<BR>
The map is not the territory. 
<BR>
<P>And here's an example of Bandler's attitude towards his work  (I can
<BR>
imagine him grinning as he invented the label &quot;Neuro Linguistic
<BR>
Programming&quot;):
<BR>
<P>His experiments concerning delusional patients sound equally fun. One
<BR>
poor soul who thought he was Jesus Christ got the Bandler treatment,
<BR>
which sounds more like a play than medical therapy. He had arranged for
<BR>
Roman costumes to be issued to members of staff and for them to patrol
<BR>
outside the patient's room. Bandler went into the room donning full Roman
<BR>
outfit, carrying two huge planks of wood, some very large nails and an
<BR>
even bigger hammer. It wasn't long before the patient started protesting
<BR>
that he wasn't Jesus at all and Bandler responded in true jobsworth
<BR>
style, 'sorry mate, out of my hands, just following orders..'. Soon
<BR>
enough the patient, who had thought himself to be Christ for years, had
<BR>
remembered exactly who he was.
