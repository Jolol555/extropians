<EM>&gt; to make sure we understand how each local thing works.  But once we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand that, and we can see what details matter and what don't, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we should be able to throw away most of the irrelevant detail and simulate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at a higher level of abstraction.

<P>I agree. However, that process of learning and incemental improvement will
<BR>
almost certainly take several decades if it is done using extensions of
<BR>
current techniques. That makes the resulting brain simulation a 2030 - 2050
<BR>
era technology, vs 2010 - 2030 for basic nanotech manufacturing, sensing and
<BR>
computing devices. You are correct in that nanotech isn't an essential
<BR>
prerequisite, in principle, but it seems very likely that simple nanotech will
<BR>
be availible before any sort of uploading.
<BR>
<P>It is also worth noting that technologies such as neural inerfaces,
<BR>
intelligence enhancement and sentient AI also look quite plausible in that
<BR>
time frame. The 2010-2050 era is a tangled snarl of possibilities, in which
<BR>
nanotech, AI, IE, neural interfaces and uploading are all likely to appear in
<BR>
some uncertain order, with the course of later developments being heavily
<BR>
influenced by those that happen to come first.
<BR>
<P>IMO, a plausible scenario needs to explicitly posit a particular sequence and
<BR>
timing to these developments, and then extrapolate their interactions and
<BR>
effects on society from there. Looking at one technology in isolation will
<BR>
inevitably give misleading results, because the odds of any of them actually
<BR>
existing in isolation for long are very low.
