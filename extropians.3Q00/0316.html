<EM>&gt;&gt;the negative benefits of loading the genepool with archaic combinationsin

<EM>&gt;&gt;the face of rapid environmental change....
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nicely put.  Wish you had been available twenty years ago to debate the then 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gurus of life extension.  This was also W. Donner Denkla's position, BTW,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but the problem was that the prior generations couldn't think very well in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terms of &quot;systems.&quot;  They refused to see beyond the genetic driving force of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the individual survival.  Thus, they utterly rejected out-of-hand any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arguments for the existence of a &quot;death gene,&quot; or &quot;aging clock.&quot;  
</EM><BR>
<P>You misunderstand how biologists came to the conclusion.  The effects of
<BR>
selection other than individual survival were considered carefully, and
<BR>
found to be negligible compared to individual survival.  In addition,
<BR>
an &quot;aging clock&quot; is equally disadvantageous to a group; since it entails
<BR>
direct reproductive loss (death of perfectly functional individuals)
<BR>
the group is at a serious disadvantage compered to groups that don't
<BR>
off perfectly serviceable individuals. &quot;Archaic&quot; gene combinations
<BR>
aren't generally bad - in the case of stabilizing selection, genetic
<BR>
drift, and fast fluctuating selection, they are better.  In any case,
<BR>
old individuals with bad genes will be dead anyway; continued survival 
<BR>
is an excellent demonstration of quality.
