<P><EM>&gt; Many are relatively young, and single.  But many are not.  Have you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciously chosen not to have kids?  If so, why?  Do you have kids, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have chosen not to mention it? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Being a dyed-in-the-wool geek, it took me FOREVER to work out this whole 
<BR>
male/female relationship thing. As a consequence I was almost 30 by the 
<BR>
time I lost my virginity. When I finally found myself in a relationship 
<BR>
with someone who I would want to procreate with (the lady who is now my 
<BR>
wife) there turned out to be complications. She has trouble conceiving 
<BR>
children, and refuses to use any sort of medical intervention. Her problem 
<BR>
in partly genetic, and she doesn't believe that genetic sterility is a 
<BR>
trait that should be passed on. I've tried to convince her that it soon 
<BR>
won't be a problem to correct genetic problems, but she would rather wait 
<BR>
until after there are proven genetic modification techniques before going 
<BR>
that route. Finally, she is some 15 years older than me and so menopause 
<BR>
is looming on the horizon for her.  Its beginning to look like we won't 
<BR>
have kids unless we end up with both genetic modification AND age-
<BR>
regression technology in our lifetimes. Its a real shame, since both of 
<BR>
use would love to have kids.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Those of you with life-mates:  how do they feel about your extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interests?  Do they share them?  Tolerate them?  Did they share any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these interests prior to the start of your relationship, or did you convert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them?  (Or, did they convert you?)
</EM><BR>
<P>My wife was borderline extropian when I met her, and she has become 
<BR>
steadily moreso with time. She is now hoping that much of the promise of  
<BR>
nanotechnology is realized within her lifetime. This is not so unlikely, 
<BR>
since she comes of longlived stock, and her grandmother (who she strongly 
<BR>
resembles) was lively, intelligent and active up to about the age of 105.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, she has been far more interested in controlled diet and 
<BR>
careful monitoring of food and chemical effects on the body, and has 
<BR>
convinced me to change many of my eating habits to more healthy ones.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And for everyone:  Do you try to pass the memes on to your friends and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colleagues?  How successful have you been?  Who seems the most/least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receptive?  What approaches worked?
</EM><BR>
<P>Most of the folks that I have as friends and colleagues are the sorts that 
<BR>
already had the memes for extropianism when I met them. We differ greatly 
<BR>
in our views on time scales and other factors governing the singularity, 
<BR>
but few of my friends think its an outlandish idea.
