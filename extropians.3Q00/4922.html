<EM>&gt; The very fact that more efforts and dollars are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent preserving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a limited lifespan for other species while avoiding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or ignoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the individual extinction of our own species, person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by death, is deplorable.
</EM><BR>
<P>True-
<BR>
but the kind of problem that concerns me is not so
<BR>
much that many of these species are dying out from,
<BR>
say, overhunting, but that the deaths of many are
<BR>
caused indirectly by us- like the Golden Toad of South
<BR>
America, whose numbers mysteriously began dropping
<BR>
until 1989, when they were no longer seen.  They
<BR>
occupied an extremely small niche in the rainforest,
<BR>
true, and they would probably have died out eventually
<BR>
anyways, but it's a disheartening thing to watch it
<BR>
happen, as due to our presence it's happening far
<BR>
faster than normal.  The biome as a whole has survived
<BR>
far greater extinctions, and humans have an amazing
<BR>
edge on other creatures as far as survival is
<BR>
concerned, but nonetheless it should be a cause for
<BR>
some concern that we are poisoning our environment in
<BR>
ways that are irrevocable.  
<BR>
A somewhat crude but workable thought experiment is
<BR>
this:
<BR>
Say you are in a room with five other people.  Every
<BR>
once in a while, gunfire rings out from across the
<BR>
street, and kills one of the people in your room.  You
<BR>
don't necessarily need the other people, but it's nice
<BR>
to have them around, and some of them you care deeply
<BR>
about.  Now, say (for some reason, maybe there are no
<BR>
police) the only way to stop the gunfire was to shoot
<BR>
the person across the way who was firing, or to pay
<BR>
them to go away.  If any other people in your
<BR>
apartment leave, they might be shot, and you are the
<BR>
only person allowed to escape from this place. Though
<BR>
buying a gun costs money, and so does payment, these
<BR>
are both worthwhile considerations.
<BR>
If you think of the environment in terms of the
<BR>
economic value it provides, as well as the aesthetic
<BR>
value, along with any other intrinsic properties it
<BR>
may have, this provides the population for the room of
<BR>
this thought experiment.  If you think of the value of
<BR>
the gunner across the street as the value of our
<BR>
industrial factories- and this works well, as there
<BR>
are better ways of doing these things, just as there
<BR>
are better ways of having a good time than shooting
<BR>
people in your apartment, though they may be somewhat
<BR>
less fun to this gunner.    The gunner is still
<BR>
essentially usefull... but their existence is in its
<BR>
current form parasitic, which, as a primate of sorts
<BR>
myself, I find the concept of parasites of any kind
<BR>
intolerable, unless they serve as a symbiote on some
<BR>
larger scale.  It's simply that I have trouble
<BR>
thinking that life will effectively adapt to the
<BR>
outpouring of hundreds of gallons of toxins every year
<BR>
into it's system.  It may adapt somewhat, but we as
<BR>
well should be a part of that adaption, by slowing or
<BR>
even reversing the process as much as possible.
<BR>
We should, of course, consider our own quality of life
<BR>
as well as a major area of concern, but stating that
<BR>
the environment is the source of the money loss is
<BR>
being untruthfull when regarded in terms of so many
<BR>
other wastes which we quite often blithely ignore,
<BR>
such as keeping over 1.7 million prisoners (1 out of
<BR>
every 54 people) in jail fed, cared for, and housed.
<BR>
Other examples of waste are our continued spending
<BR>
(the pentagon actually got 8 billion dollars they
<BR>
didn't need recently) on offensive weapons when what
<BR>
we truly need is the development of a strong defense
<BR>
network of some kind, so that we don't have to be as
<BR>
reliant on nuclear weaponry.  There are countless
<BR>
examples of this sort.  We need, most certainly, to
<BR>
focus on the human standard of living worldwide, or at
<BR>
the very least in our own nation, but I consider a
<BR>
good secondary cause that of our environment.
