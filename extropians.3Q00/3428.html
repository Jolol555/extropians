<EM>&gt; &quot;Jamiro2002&quot;, please reveal your true name so that I may file a lawsuit for

<P>I've only just seen this thread (my ISP's been down for two days) and,
<BR>
while I'm pretty disgusted, I have to say that getting uptight over this
<BR>
sort of allegation is counter-productive.
<BR>
<P>I can't speak for anyone else, but anonymous sock-puppets throwing
<BR>
emotive accusations unsupported by evidence aren't going to convince
<BR>
me of anything -- except that Max and Keith have some very dumb enemies
<BR>
who are trying to be crudely manipulative.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, I've been reading up on the Church of Scientology in
<BR>
the past week or so -- research for a project -- and came across this
<BR>
fun web page:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~av282/terms.htm">http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~av282/terms.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>I'd like to urge any Extropians who don't know anything about the Co$ to
<BR>
read as much of it as they can stomach. It's a dictionary.  It defines
<BR>
referents within a language: concepts and terms used internally within
<BR>
the Church. I don't think it's a fake. And I don't think I'm exaggerating
<BR>
much if I state that trying to put myself inside the mind of someone
<BR>
who thinks in these terms gives me the same queasy sensation I get when
<BR>
I try to understand Nazism.
<BR>
<P>These guys would certainly consider libel, disinformation, and slander
<BR>
to be acceptable ways of dealing with people who shine torches into the
<BR>
murkier corners of their operations. And while they might deserve our
<BR>
contempt (especially if, as seems likely, they're behind the flame-bait
<BR>
posting that started this thread), they should be treated with the same
<BR>
caution due to any other venomous insect.
