<EM>&gt; I'm not sure we know much about how nanotech changes the relative rates of

<P>I have to agree with Robin.  Nanotech is simply the enabling technology,
<BR>
what we get out of it depends on where we put our money and energy in
<BR>
designing the future.  One of the things I'm seeing out of this discussion
<BR>
is the degree to which we *can* steer this direction.  We can end up
<BR>
being a Matrioshka Brain controlled by a monolithic somewhat demented
<BR>
megamind that does nothing but quantum gravity calculations all day
<BR>
or we can end up as a highly diversified polymorphic culture of nanotech
<BR>
entities each operating at a level and interfacing to various virtual
<BR>
realities as we so personally choose.  Quite different pictures and
<BR>
probably determined in part by chaotic events we cannot control and
<BR>
in part by things that we do control such as investment choices and
<BR>
the &quot;enrollment&quot; of others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think you understand the economic argument here.  Even ignoring speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantages of uploads, since it is cheap to create uploads, the supply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increases quickly, which lowers the market wage.  I did try to explain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this stuff at <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>Robin, I haven't read this recently, but I think it was written before
<BR>
much of the Internet economy arose.
<BR>
<P>I've seen arguments that the dot.com's tend to drive themselves out of
<BR>
business at an ever increasing rate.  This is partly because the
<BR>
expectation of huge free give-aways up-front to capture part of
<BR>
the market segment (cell phones) and because things like software agents
<BR>
should drive the profit margins down to ~0 at which point the company runs
<BR>
out of capital and goes belly up (e.g. Amazon potentially).
<BR>
<P>Don't cheap copies only do the same thing for labor market?
<BR>
You argue that the copies become cheaper than humans.  Ok fine.
<BR>
But isn't the problem that the copies compete against each other
<BR>
to drive the profit out of their specific specialty?  Shouldn't
<BR>
the cost of labor fall to approximately the level of the amortized
<BR>
cost of the hardware plus the energy required to operate it?
<BR>
<P>Since labor is what is required to build increasingly more efficient
<BR>
hardware (the self-evolving AI model), doesn't it rapidly spiral
<BR>
to the point where you have reached the physical limits?  And
<BR>
isn't this just another way of looking at the singularity?
<BR>
<P>It seems for your model to be valid for very long you have to
<BR>
put some constraints on the rate of invention approaching the
<BR>
physical limits.
<BR>
<P>Robert
