<P><EM>&gt; Okay, this is a theoretical question that I'd like to ask without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting bogged down in politics. I'm using Napster and Gnutella as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convenient examples and not because I approve or disapprove of either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Gnutella--

<EM>&gt; 2. Napster--
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm glad you brought this up.  Over the last month I have been nothing less
<BR>
than OBSESSED with both, as I see the development of distributed
<BR>
decentralized file sharing as the future of the internet and quite possible
<BR>
the architecture that will facilitate much of the spontaneous orders that we
<BR>
have promulgated for years.
<BR>
<P>***BTW, I strongly encourage everyone on this list to check out Mojo Nation
<BR>
Software as soon as possible.   <A HREF="http://www.mojonation.net/">http://www.mojonation.net/</A>
<BR>
<P>The open-source community is working steadily on the next generation of
<BR>
Gnutella, and promises to fix a lot of its current shortcomings.  Several
<BR>
start-up companies are already receiving lots of VC from big names like Marc
<BR>
Andressen to capitalize on the architecture of Gnutella.  He is financing a
<BR>
new start-up to do the exhaustive searches you want.  The scheme is called
<BR>
&quot;Infrasearch&quot; and has the potential to search the entire net and everyone's
<BR>
public hard rives.  A far cry from the 20% or less than current search
<BR>
engines do.  Check out GoneSilent at <A HREF="http://www.gonesilent.com/">http://www.gonesilent.com/</A>
<BR>
<P>As for Napster itself, check out Napigator at <A HREF="http://www.napigator.com/">http://www.napigator.com/</A>
<BR>
this tool allows you to connect to ANY Napster compatible server - and there
<BR>
are over 100 around the world and growing!  So shutting down Napster the
<BR>
company will hardly shut down Napster the search client..
<BR>
<P>And finally please check out Mojo Nation.  <A HREF="http://www.mojonation.net/">http://www.mojonation.net/</A>
<BR>
This software has the potential of creating the worlds first decentralize
<BR>
online currency - can we say anonymous e-cash?  Give Mojo Nation file
<BR>
swapping a few years, and mojo bucks could become more valuable the real
<BR>
dollars.
