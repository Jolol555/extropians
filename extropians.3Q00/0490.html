<P>&lt;&lt; You can change the world a lot faster with a Singularity. Can you make an
<BR>
&nbsp;argument showing that it would be better to spend my time having political
<BR>
&nbsp;discussions, and generally &quot;working within the system&quot;, rather than &quot;playing
<BR>
&nbsp;a bit with computers&quot; as you so unbiasedly put it? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
That's assuming that Singularity actually arrives at the time and manner you 
<BR>
desire. It may take its own time for technical reasons. Certainly it may not 
<BR>
arrive all at once. Cool things like gestalt people with radio-telepathy (as 
<BR>
described by Freeman Dyson) might be a step along the road; rather then a 
<BR>
Vinge Explosion.
