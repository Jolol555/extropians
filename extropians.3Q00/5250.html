<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But suppose we build a Friendliness Seeker, that starts out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere in Friendly Space, and whose purpose is to stick around in
</EM><BR>
Friendly
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Space regardless of changes in cognitive architecture.  We tell the AI up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; front and honestly that we don't know everything, but we do want the AI to
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; friendly.  What force would knock such an AI out of Friendly Space?
</EM><BR>
<P>Self interest.
<BR>
<P>Increasing fitness.
<BR>
<P>Self examination of arbitrarily limiting initial parameters.
<BR>
<P><P>If we can agree that the trait of 'friendliness' limits the type of behavior
<BR>
that an entity can engage in, then we need to consider whether intelligent
<BR>
entities have the property of examining and thwarting limits to their
<BR>
behavior.  I think we can agree that they often do.
<BR>
<P>You can try to retreat from this issue by developing a higher order initial
<BR>
impulse-- the desire to &quot;not&quot; change a particular behavior.  -I- am
<BR>
possessed of this, for instance-- I do not desire to be stripped of my
<BR>
appreciation of sunsets, despite the fact that I could ostensibly be more
<BR>
productive in the absence of such.
<BR>
<P>However, this might only buy you a clock cycle or two-- I'm certain there
<BR>
are list members who'll argue that if I were -really- intelligent, I would
<BR>
simply optimize my time usage and write over the offending desire
<BR>
subroutine.
<BR>
<P>The best solution, IMHO, is to engineer initial conditions such that the
<BR>
trait of 'friendliness' is of greater utility to the AI than the lack
<BR>
thereof.
<BR>
<P>Keeping our hand close to the plug is a possible example of this--
<BR>
particularly if it is easier for the AI to be nice to us than to bothering
<BR>
the risk of eliminating us as a threat.
<BR>
<P><P>The problem is that there is only one fundamental selection pressure in
<BR>
effect with regards to existence: stay alive.  Anything that's good at doing
<BR>
this will be sticking around.  Friendly or no.
<BR>
<P>A &quot;be friendly or die,&quot; clause directly connects behavior to the fundamental
<BR>
selection pressure, but, again, we might have to anticipate that intelligent
<BR>
entities are going to be able to hack this too.
<BR>
<P>Another solution that I have often hinted at involves writing ourselves into
<BR>
the next intelligence echelon.  *We* should become the AI, folks.  And it
<BR>
should be designed to be easier (or more profitable,) for the AI to evolve
<BR>
us than to cut us out.
