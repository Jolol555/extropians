<P>
<EM>&gt; The standard in the United States is that illegally obtained evidence is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inadmissible.  Cops or prosecutors who illegally obtain evidence are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject to disciplinary action.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This seems like the wrong solution.  What I suggest instead is that in some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations of illegally obtained evidence (lack of search warrant or probable 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cause, say, not coerced confession), the court take two steps:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.  Admit the evidence against the defendant, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.  Criminally prosecute whoever illegally obtained the evidence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Does anyone know if this has already been tried elsewhere?
</EM><BR>
<P>One can hear the refrains of _The_Prince_ in the background.  There will be 
<BR>
those out there, especially private individuals engaging in the profit (private
<BR>
detective) or vigilante motives who will continue to gain information
<BR>
illegally, in the hopes of finding a sympathetic jury that will acquit them
<BR>
of wrongdoing, or find them guilty of lesser charges.
<BR>
<P>THe other problem with illegally obtained evidence lies in the fact that 
<BR>
since it was obtained illegally, it is outside the normal investigative 
<BR>
bounds, and therefore is much more difficult to corroborate.  In fact, a 
<BR>
large prtion of illegal evidence can only be corroborated through violating
<BR>
the 5th amendment right against self-incrimination, the last (and only?) 
<BR>
defense against torture and other coercive tactics.  And if it is 
<BR>
uncorroborated, there is the window of opportunity for fabrication, even if 
<BR>
it's only of small details that can color the evidence.
<BR>
<P>Illegal evidence is illegal for a reason.  Leave it that way - unless you think
<BR>
somehow justice is served by lynchings and vigilante actions.
<BR>
<P>If you want to tinker with the legal system, consider where the other holes 
<BR>
are - a Byzantine and somewhat contradictory tort code, amateur jurors, and
<BR>
the increasing criminalization of private, consensual acts (so-called 
<BR>
&quot;victimless crimes&quot;).  Let's stop trying to make it easier to throw people in
<BR>
jail.
