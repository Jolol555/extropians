<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We want to change ourselves, to make ourselves richer, smarter, and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And others don't seem terribly excited by this.  Why?  One simple theory is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they are afraid of what we would do with such powers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you need a vivid demonstration, try the following question on people you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;A random person in the world will be chosen, and you get this choice:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a) Let them have $X more worth of real resources (such as by telling them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to find an oil reserve that would otherwise remain unfound.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;b) Nothing happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which do you choose?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I would choose not to give it to him. I do so because I know that if this
<BR>
person (person Y) is wealthier, then that means that whatever wealth I have,
<BR>
is lessened. If Joe X wants to sell some property and I want to buy it, then
<BR>
have if I let this person Y have the oil wealth which would otherwise remain
<BR>
unfound, then there is more competition for the property I bidding for, and
<BR>
the price goes up.
<BR>
<P>Wealth is relative, in many respects (and this does not pertain to
<BR>
heightened standards of living caused by the accumulation of the benefits of
<BR>
technology &amp; engineering, etc).
<BR>
So why do people choose not to let this person Y have the wealth, and why do
<BR>
we not know why they make this decision?
<BR>
Because people make these types of decisions without thinking. They don't
<BR>
have to think about it. There is a survival advantage to thinking this way;
<BR>
it's bred into us over eons.
