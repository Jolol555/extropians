<EM>&gt; That seems to be much more realistic. Do you know if the author
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; royalties are the same dollar amount for each format, or is it set to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percentage? How does that price for the paperback compare for the number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of pages, etc. to other similar books??
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not know exactly how much the author makes however my memory is
<BR>
take Victor Koman claimed that he got more per copy sold on pulpless.com
<BR>
than he got from a regular paper publisher.  Plus what pulpless.com and
<BR>
other companies are starting to do is to create the paper books on a
<BR>
order by order basis for books that do not sell in large volume.  Not
<BR>
only does this help reduce storage costs but it has avoids inventory
<BR>
tax.  The quality of these books which are created individually is much
<BR>
better than many people realize.
<BR>
<P>The books from pulpless.com that I am familiar with are both by Victor
<BR>
Koman.  One was published as a hardback in 1987 (The Jehovah Contract)
<BR>
for USD16.95 and the other (Kings of the High Frontier) was published in
<BR>
hardback after the electronic publication.  Both books have won the
<BR>
Prometheus Award from the Libertarian Futurist Society.  Kings of the
<BR>
High Frontier won as an electronically published book before it had been
<BR>
published on paper.  Both books are a fun read.
