<BR>
to ram GMO down our throats whether we like it or not:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; In 1999, genetically modified seeds designed to produce their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insecticides or withstand powerful new herbicides comprised 57 percent of the
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's an updated quote for you: &quot;Science stops where politics [or marketing]
<BR>
begins.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My last post was labeled troll-work by someone who insisted I had no right to say
<BR>
anything until I had posted a certain (unspecified) number of posts first.  The
<BR>
abrupt Catch-22 attack took me aback.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I have something else to say.  If Catch-22 is still in effect, someone
<BR>
else will have to set the server to delete my message.
<BR>
<P>Question: are you folks familiar with the Bay of Mexico dead zone?  If not, here's
<BR>
a basic reference...

<BR>
<P>Now the article gives a simplistic &quot;nutrient overload&quot; view of the matter, but
<BR>
there are those who look deeper.  And some of the better minds are wondering if
<BR>
modern farming with its over-reliance on herbicides is causing problems much
<BR>
bigger, and faster, than nature can clean them up.  I'm only using the &quot;Dead Zone&quot;
<BR>
as one illustration of non-thinking people pushing us into deep trouble.  There
<BR>
are plenty more: the Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound, etc.
<BR>
<P>I know many of you people are gizmo-heads and think technology is *the* answer for
<BR>
everything, but big-time messing with the environment can cause trouble that may
<BR>
be impossible to back out of---emergency government funding to the contrary.
<BR>
<P>Look back up at the snippet above and see if you can visualize the CEO's of those
<BR>
big GMO companies drooling over the profits from increased pesticide/herbicide
<BR>
sales.  I'm a bit of a techno-head myself, but I'm also a non-toxic farmer and my
<BR>
studies have revealed *nothing* that the GMO companies are doing that can help the
<BR>
land.  No, it's quite the contrary. GMOs should be tested to see what they will
<BR>
bungle.  And, I'm sorry to say, that testing may need to be for much longer
<BR>
periods of time than you're thinking---perhaps for generations.
<BR>
<P>BTW, I think it was Bonnie who broached the subject of animal/human
<BR>
communication.  Did anyone bring up Monty Roberts?  If he and his horses are not
<BR>
communicating, I honestly don't know the meaning of the word.
