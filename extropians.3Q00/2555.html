<P>From: &quot;Matt Gingell&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mjg223@is7.nyu.edu?Subject=Re:%20Dumb%20Question&In-Reply-To=&lt;002c01bffee3$caaf9880$db44fea9@xps120&gt;">mjg223@is7.nyu.edu</A>&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;major sniperoo&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;...To which I would follow up:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When the Singularity comes, your AI mailer will do it for you. Excelsior!
</EM><BR>
<P>Hello, Mark,
<BR>
I see you've met the welcoming committee! Don't abandon all hope just yet.
<BR>
You see, Matt has recently been selected as your pet hominid during your
<BR>
transition to posthuman status. As your introductory packet has informed
<BR>
you, uploading and uplifting have been eliminated from the hominid
<BR>
progression, due to unforeseen stability and integrity concerns
<BR>
in the original substrate. Leapfrogging is apparently the only option open
<BR>
at this point in space-time...unless you want to try that tunneling
<BR>
thingie that's rather avante-gardish this millennium.
<BR>
<P>Of course, if you prefer to remain human, we will equip you with all the
<BR>
latest in LE protocols, financial strategies, legal advisors and an
<BR>
&quot;Offshore/Off-planet Govt. For Dummies&quot; and &quot;Govt. For Dummies Quick
<BR>
Reference Guide&quot; at no additional charge. WOMD available at-cost.
<BR>
<P>So, we've got it all! Whether you think big (M-brains) or small
<BR>
(nano/gene-gineering) we're well equipped to provide it all. And lest you
<BR>
think that techno-geek is our only culture, be forewarned about our
<BR>
musicians and artists who compose with string theory on the cosmic canvas.
<BR>
<P>Now, exchange your current gods for the gods of rational, critical
<BR>
and creative thinking. Next, be prepared to improve, optimize,
<BR>
augment and, finally, extend all aspects of your identity, existence and
<BR>
reality.  Once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll realize how inevitable
<BR>
that initial leap...
<BR>
<P>And in closing:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; {8-]   Mark, did anyone warn you we have a weird sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of humor?  {8^D  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be part of the Jones Binary currently visible in the California
<BR>
skies. 'Overcoming' gravity has always been an issue
<BR>
during their watch. They are in charge of transportation.
<BR>
<P>So. Welcome, and enjoy the ride.
<BR>
