<EM>&gt; &gt;Its doesn't necessarily require a nanosanta at all. normal scale

<EM>&gt; &gt;autoreplicators/automated refinery/assembly processors are sufficient to bring

<EM>&gt; &gt;the cost of cars, houses, refrigerators, stoves, and microwave ovens down to a

<EM>&gt; You are living in more of a fantasy world than I realized.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think we can have a productive conversation now.  Take care.

<P>Sorry you feel that way Robin, but look at the record of prices for consumer
<BR>
goods and durable goods, adjusted for inflation. Prices are not going up, they
<BR>
are going down, while third world incomes are going up. As more and more plant
<BR>
automation occurs, this trending will continue. Concern about accelerated prices
<BR>
for oil will only occur if the Chinese cease to burn the dirty coal they use
<BR>
currently prior to the establishment of other non-oil energy sources, either as
<BR>
solar sats, nukes, what have you.
<BR>
<P>Its Krugman who is living in a fantasy world of limited expectations and of
<BR>
resource use unmitigated by new paradigms of utilization efficiency. I KNOW its
<BR>
possible to gain magnitude changes in efficiency, I've done it.
