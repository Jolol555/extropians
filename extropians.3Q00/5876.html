<P><EM>&gt; My problems are really three-fold here as to specifics.  #1:  I'v ebrought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up the environmental issue before.  Group A may wish to simply be left alone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but they're deforesting a hillside above Group B's settlement, causing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water to be fouled and increasing the damage of floods in the springtime.  To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fix the flood problem, Group B builds a dam to moderate flooding - but now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Group C isn't getting enough water.  How do you resolve this in a libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion, if negotiation fails?
</EM><BR>
<P>By having a group of arbiters or an overarching state that all the
<BR>
groups have agreed to let settle these matters or arbitrate their
<BR>
settlement in a just (respecting individual rights) manner.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #2:  Not everyone will play by the &quot;non-coercive&quot; rule.  Simply look at how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful a memetic structure religion is.  I would love to be left alone - but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a group of people reading one of a handful of passages from Leviticus suddenly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gets this idea that I am less deserving to live than they are.  One of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tradeoffs in modern western political systems is that this sort of activity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mostly curtailed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Memetic infections are NOT forms of coercion that libertarianism is
<BR>
arrayed against.  It is against the initiation of physical force.  These
<BR>
religious no-noughts can believe whatever they like and teach whatever
<BR>
they like.  But they cannot physically coerce or harm you without
<BR>
breaking the law.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; #3:  Markets are wonderful, btu I doubt withotu a regulatory regime that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be as resistant to fraud and manipulation as they are now.  Market-based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems work, but I don't know if I could trust a mechanism that operates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the honor system to play such a vital role in my life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It doesn't operate on &quot;the honor system&quot;.  It operates on upholding
<BR>
individual rights.  When it doesn't it is out of there.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The other issue here is the ability of a libertarian society or culture to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resist the influence of a better organized, more coercive society.  My concern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is less the libertarian society acting in a physically coercive way (One could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argue abot memetic coercion, such as a proselytizing meme, but I don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how that fits into a libertarian view) but more a non-libertarian society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acting in a coercive manne rtowards the libertarian one.  The closest thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have to a guattantor that this won't happen is the presence of nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devices, and to a lesser extent the ability to locate in a place beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traditional borders and geographic pressures (i.e. space)
</EM><BR>
<P>Dunno what you are really getting at there.  The less repressive US of
<BR>
the 18th and 19th century stood up rather well to more repressive and
<BR>
better organized and richer countries.
