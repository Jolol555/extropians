<P>FB:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; … the reason for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; armed population….is to keep [government] (and private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hoodlums)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in check, to keep the would-be rulers constantly in fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the citizenry.
</EM><BR>
<P>HF:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;That's a better reason. One problem is that not only government and
</EM><BR>
hoodlums, but everyone else, lives constantly in fear of the citizenry.
<BR>
<P>FB:
<BR>
It is not a “better reason”, it is THE reason. It is a question of
<BR>
relative safety- better to be in fear of a wacko with an RPG than a
<BR>
wacko (e.g. the treasonous, genocidal, rapist murderer President W.
<BR>
Clinton) with 30000+ nukes. It is not possible to legislate ultimate
<BR>
safety.
<BR>
<P>HF:
<BR>
I remember when I went into a jewelry store where the proprietor wore
<BR>
a sidearm. It was pretty scary knowing he could pull out his gun and
<BR>
shoot me dead at any time. I didn't go back.
<BR>
<P>FB:
<BR>
I remember many occasions being in the vicinity of an armed employee of
<BR>
a government. It was pretty scary knowing he/she could pull out hir gun
<BR>
and shoot me dead at any time. The fact that s/he would probably not
<BR>
face any serious charges of murder, but simply some interdepartmental
<BR>
review by peer- at best- greatly heightened the sense of vulnerability.
<BR>
I do not generally carry a weapon, and so was unable to provide a
<BR>
counterforce.  I only wish I could not go back. I would much rather deal
<BR>
with an armed private citizen primarily interested in free trade and
<BR>
self-preservation, such as a jewelry merchant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Taking a single point out of context is not a very effective means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of making a cogent argument. It can distract a reader from the
</EM><BR>
essential
<BR>
<EM>&gt; theory, and lead one down irrelevant lines of inquiry. The &quot;founding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fathers&quot;, many of whom were deists [2], with a few christians, were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing for their time, as is quite evident in the remainder of this
</EM><BR>
particular
<BR>
<EM>&gt; document.
</EM><BR>
<P>HF:
<BR>
Okay, but you started off with this stuff about being created by God
<BR>
who gave us rights. Was I supposed to get a lump in my throat reading
<BR>
these revered documents?
<BR>
<P>FB:
<BR>
I would not presume to dictate your emotional response to some quoted
<BR>
text. The item in question opens with a line about supernatural
<BR>
entities, which was included in the cut/paste for ease of recognition.
<BR>
It may have been included in the original document as a PR strategy.
<BR>
Personally, I do not find deism to be at odds with my asymptotic
<BR>
approach to freedom from belief.
<BR>
<P>HF:
<BR>
The US' declaration of independence is a load
<BR>
of crap.
<BR>
<P>FB:
<BR>
I was unable to measure any fecal matter in the content.
<BR>
<P>HF:
<BR>
It has no more relevance to me than the story of Robin Hood
<BR>
and Good King John.
<BR>
<P>FB:
<BR>
It has a trifle more meaning to myself, as I live on the territory of
<BR>
the country that was founded on it. This does not mean retreating to the
<BR>
“last refuge of a scoundrel”, but rather to study and understand the
<BR>
philosophy and history of that era and its manifestation- the
<BR>
now-deceased Constitutional Republic of the uSA. It appears to have
<BR>
functioned _fairly_ well up until its overthrow under the dictatorship
<BR>
of Abraham Lincoln. It also has rather more relevance to me than, say,
<BR>
Hansel and Grettle, as it is in the direct line of my (american)
<BR>
political descent. It has an effect on my milieu, albeit diluted.
<BR>
<P>HF:
<BR>
&nbsp;BTW that story teaches us that we should be armed
<BR>
so that we can rob from the rich and give to the poor.
<BR>
<P>FB:
<BR>
The Communist Manifesto and the Bibles(s) also suggest such violent
<BR>
remedies, this does not make them valid either. The reason for arms is
<BR>
not to steal, but rather to prevent theft and murder by public or
<BR>
private criminals. The Declaration of Independence is an example of the
<BR>
extremes required when oppressors, under color of law, exceed their
<BR>
limits. If a population is not armed to at least an effective weighted
<BR>
kill ratio, its oppressors cannot be exterminated as required. The
<BR>
experimentally validated result is then a mass extermination, or pogrom.
<BR>
This is something any life extension advocate should bear in mind.
<BR>
<P>HF:
<BR>
&nbsp;Just quoting old documents is no argument.
<BR>
<P>FB:
<BR>
The age of a document is not necessarily indicative of its validity. The
<BR>
quoted material was &quot;just&quot; a succinct summation of the argument.
