<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think a revision is in order here. according to recent posts
<BR>
from eliezer to the extropians mailing list, his design does take into
<BR>
consideration that there might be no such thing as objective ethics. so if
<BR>
a mind does anthing at all, it would be because it was objectively right
<BR>
_or_ because it had nothing better to do. for all i know, eliezer's design 
<BR>
might have incorporated this view from the beginning; but this the first
<BR>
time i've seen it confirmed.
