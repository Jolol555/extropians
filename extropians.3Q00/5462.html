<P>VIEWPOINT
<BR>
<P>Unsafe Gun Laws: reducing access to guns makes people sitting prey.
<BR>
By John R. Lott 
<BR>
<P>It was a gruesome story. At the end of August, a naked man broke
<BR>
into a  Merced, Calif, home and used a pithcfork to stab to death
<BR>
9-year-old Ashley Carpenter and her 7-year-old brother, John. Three
<BR>
other sisters barely escaped, with two &quot;bleeding from dozens of
<BR>
puncture wounds&quot; according to one report.
<BR>
<P>Little Ashley bravely slowed down the killer as she held on to his
<BR>
leg while screaming &quot;Stop it, don't hurt my sister.&quot; Her actions
<BR>
saved her three sisters lives.
<BR>
<P>In a scenario worthy of a horror movie, the children's first
<BR>
response was to call police, but the telephone lines had been cut.
<BR>
<P>Still, this tragedy could have been prevented. While the attacker
<BR>
was breaking into the house, 14-year-old sister Jessica, who was
<BR>
baby-sitting her younger siblings, desperately tried to get their
<BR>
fathers gun.
<BR>
<P>But as a good law-abiding citizen, the father had locked the gun
<BR>
away in compliance with California law.
<BR>
<P>Jessica knows how to use a gun and is a good shot. The childrens
<BR>
great-uncle, the Rev. John Hilton, said. &quot;If only Jessica had a gun
<BR>
available to her, she could have stopped the whole thing. If she
<BR>
had been properly armed, she could have stopped him in his tracks.&quot;
