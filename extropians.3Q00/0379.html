Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The problem for &quot;aging gene&quot; theory is not so much the wide effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of aging as the variability.
</EM><BR>
<P>What variability? I said before that there are great similarities in the
<BR>
aging process of all well-studied mammals.
<BR>
<P>I've got another question, why don't reptilians or amphibians show
<BR>
widespread aging? Even species such as Desmognathus that live less than 15
<BR>
years do not show signs of increased mortality with age (in fact, they show
<BR>
decreased mortality after adulthood is reached). So, how come some species
<BR>
-- e.g. mammals -- accumulate all those thousands of genes causing
<BR>
age-related changes you claim to exist and others accumulate none? According
<BR>
to your evolutionary theory, all species should be on equal grounds to
<BR>
accumulate age-related pathologies; the only factor would be mortality (and
<BR>
subsequent longevity); but that alone does not explain why is aging present
<BR>
in all known species of a class and practically none of others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No, two genetic effects which produce many but not all aging phenotypes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't prove that you can't produce those phenotypes by other mechanisms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Indeed, every inbred mouse line seems to have a different way to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;old.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying helicases cause aging. I'm just saying that they control many
<BR>
age-related pathologies, disproving your theory that age-related pathologies
<BR>
are caused by independant genes. As to what are the true timekeepers of
<BR>
aging, that is pure speculation.
<BR>
<P>Best regards.
