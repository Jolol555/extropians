James writes, regarding fear of armed proprietors:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; This is an irrational fear.  When you walk down a sidewalk, any one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers passing by could turn their wheel and run you over.  And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens, with intent no less, relatively often.  Do you never leave the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; house?
</EM><BR>
<P>It may be that fear of armed individuals is irrational.  There are indeed
<BR>
many other ways you could be killed.  But the gun exists specifically
<BR>
to shoot people in this situation.  The proprietor didn't wear that gun
<BR>
hoping that a duck or deer would wander into his shop.  He wore it so
<BR>
that he could apply deadly force against people.  Hopefully not against
<BR>
me, but mistakes can happen.
<BR>
<P>I wanted to be very careful that nothing I did could be misinterpreted
<BR>
as threatening.  This is the same attitude I have when stopped by the
<BR>
police.  I don't want to scare them, I want to reassure them that I am
<BR>
not a threat, and terminate the interaction as soon as possible.
