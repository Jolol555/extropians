<EM>&gt; When I consulted for a Florida University Computer Science 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; department, I recommended that they teach typing to their computer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science majors.  I found PhD students in Computer Science hunting and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pecking their code into the computer.  I documented that their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lines-per-code was limited by their input speed, not their coding 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; speed.  I was told that typing was not academic enough to qualify as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a course for this particular university.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Many high schools have replaced typing classes with &quot;word processing&quot;
<BR>
classes, where the word processing classes tend to teach point-n-click
<BR>
usage of the software package du jour.   This has been largely the result
<BR>
of pressure to teach skills useful for the &quot;computer age&quot;.
<BR>
<P>At the insistence of my parents, I took a semester of typing in high
<BR>
school, which was a couple years before the broad transistion away from
<BR>
typing classes.  While the class was exceedingly boring, I have reaped
<BR>
*enormous* benefits in the years that followed from the productivity boost
<BR>
I get from being able to type well.  I actually sucked at typing in high
<BR>
school (15-20 wpm at best), but compared to most programmers I have worked
<BR>
with, the 50-60 wpm that I type at now has saved me many hours of time to
<BR>
do equivalent work.  Typing was the most valuable class I took in high
<BR>
school.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I once worked with a UNIX sysadmin that could type as fast as
<BR>
most typists with only his index fingers.  It was amazing to see him work;
<BR>
his hands would fly in frantic scramble all over the keyboard.  Not very
<BR>
efficient though.
