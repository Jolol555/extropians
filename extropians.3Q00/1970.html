<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding making &quot;good&quot; games.  It is an interersting question as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to what seduces people into games -- currently the paradigm would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to suggest good graphics is a necessity -- in contrast the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1970's games had *no* graphics -- you had to map the game entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in your head.  I wonder if there are two types of people -- those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; who can create mental images reflecting a reality and those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; require the images to be painted for them who would be enrolled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; into very different game presentations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yeah- readers vs mouth breathers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Quite. And no Doug, you are not being cynical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a kid, I loved military aircraft, ships, and battles. Problem was, mom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refused to buy me any of those COOL GI Joe toys or other military models,
</EM><BR>
so
<BR>
<EM>&gt; being the only kid on the block who was reading whole books at age 4, I
</EM><BR>
would
<BR>
<EM>&gt; take bits of wood (we were not poor) and plastic, and make symbolic
</EM><BR>
weapons,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; vehicles, ships and soldiers, and stage my little battles in the dirtpile
</EM><BR>
behind
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the shed. Is it any wonder they other kids laughed at my little piles of
</EM><BR>
sticks
<BR>
<EM>&gt; when they asked what I was doing and I said I was running a war???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>There is an idea floating around (very strong in the general community too I
<BR>
think) that games need flashy graphics to be successful these days. Check
<BR>
out Utopia, or any of the other net-based, html based games. No graphics.
<BR>
Tens of thousands of players. Some of them are no brain surgeons. There is
<BR>
indeed a market for something other than eye-candy.
