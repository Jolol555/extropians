<P><EM>&gt; What is permaculture?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's the best site I know of for info on permaculture:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.permaculture.org.au/index.shtml">http://www.permaculture.org.au/index.shtml</A>
<BR>
<P>This site includes info and photos of Tagari Farm, a project started by Bill
<BR>
Mollison; IMO it's worth checking out the site just to see the photos of the
<BR>
farm.
<BR>
<P>I first heard of permaculture when I was describing my garden to someone I
<BR>
met at a party: the wild volunteers growing alongside cultivated crops; the
<BR>
greywater system; the fish pond; the chickens and goats in their
<BR>
vine-covered pens. (I lived in town at the time, and the neighborhood kids
<BR>
called my place the City Farm [with the accent on &quot;city&quot;} The person I was
<BR>
talking to said, &quot;Oh, you have a permaculture garden.&quot;  &quot;What's
<BR>
permaculture?&quot; I asked, and that's how I learned of Bill Mollison.
<BR>
<P>I've never had the privilege of taking one of Bill's courses, but I keep his
<BR>
books close at hand for inspiration and practical information. Many of the
<BR>
things in the books I'd come up with independently, which is not surprising,
<BR>
since the methods logically follow from a close observation of the way
<BR>
things work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From _Permaculture_:
</EM><BR>
<P>pg. ix  &quot;Permacultue is the conscious design an maintenance of
<BR>
agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity, stability,
<BR>
and resilience of natural ecosystems.  It is the harmonious integration of
<BR>
landscape and people providing their food, energy, shelter, and other
<BR>
material and non-material needs in a sustainable way...The philosophy behind
<BR>
permaculture is one of working with, rather than against, nature; of
<BR>
protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless
<BR>
acti on; of looking at systems in all their functions, rather than asking
<BR>
only one yield of them; and of allowing systems to demonstrate their own
<BR>
evolutions.&quot;
<BR>
<P>pg 1  &quot;The courage we need is to refuse authority and to accept only
<BR>
personally responsible decisions...It is...our only possible decision to
<BR>
withhold all support for destructive systems, and to cease to invest our
<BR>
lives in our own annihilation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>pg. 10  &quot;It is alarming that in western society no popular body of
<BR>
directives has arisen to replace the injunctions of tribal taboo and myth.
<BR>
When we left tribal life we left with it all guides to sensible behaviour in
<BR>
the natural world...by never having the time or commonsense to evolve new or
<BR>
current guiding directives, we have forgotten how to evolve self-regulating
<BR>
systems...[Permaculture] emphasises self-reliance, responsibility, and the
<BR>
functions of living things.  Within a self-regulated system on earth, energy
<BR>
from the sun can be trapped and stored in any number of ways.  While the sun
<BR>
burns, we are in an open system...&quot;
