<P>
Hi extropians,
<BR>
<P>In connexion with this thread.
<BR>
<P>Five things:
<BR>
<P>FIRST, if very complex adaptive systems can be shown to be locked in a
<BR>
strong coupling with an emergent, systemwide quantum potential; then
<BR>
decoherence or, equivalently, &quot;collapse&quot; would occur where the system point
<BR>
deepens, progressively, and in a runaway fashion - via positive feedback
<BR>
between QWF &amp; potential - a local system potential well when the point
<BR>
appears in a reasonable neighbourhood of that well.
<BR>
<P>The SECOND thing is that we could posit that the state vectors are
<BR>
themselves representative of qualia - and a quale is &quot;experienced&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;accessed&quot; by the system on decoherence or collapse onto a state vector. So
<BR>
the decoherence/collapse is the fundamental &quot;conscious event&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Thus, like Chalmers and the Hindus, it is economical to say that the raw
<BR>
thread of consciousness is native to all the physical Universe.
<BR>
<P>Weaving it into a fabric of consciousness is a different matter.
<BR>
<P>Our linear, time-serial consciousness - very useful (...in a Darwinian
<BR>
sense...) as a top-down integrator of the disparate, often contending set of
<BR>
processes that we call mentality - might appear as a time-periodic
<BR>
decoherence of the emergent QWF of the thalamocortical computational
<BR>
processes.
<BR>
<P>THIRDLY, we don't have to fiddle with micro things like Bose-Einstein
<BR>
condensates etc, to explain why a macroscopic emergent QWF of a complex
<BR>
computational system might be coherent.
<BR>
<P>Such a a QWF, because it represents emergent phenomena, can be effectively
<BR>
insulated from the molecular thermodynamics of the physical systems that are
<BR>
subsumed in order to effect the macro computational system.
<BR>
<P>Its effective thermodynamics is that of a system near absolute zero because
<BR>
it's causally uncoupled from small-scale phenomena. To decohere we need only
<BR>
add some classical energy and stir.
<BR>
<P>So hang the femtomachines &amp; the microtubules &amp; the quantum gravity.
<BR>
<P>FOURTHLY, we may wish to inquire about the nature of the set of ALL qualia.
<BR>
The hyperuniverse, if you will.  Surely this vastly supersets all physical
<BR>
existence. Because I can experience, in my imagination, qualia of physically
<BR>
nonexistent &amp; physically forbidden entities.
<BR>
<P>Then there is the crushingly huge set of qualia that I can't experience -
<BR>
because of the paucity of my mentatlity.
<BR>
<P>So how big is this set of ALL qualia? So large, I think, that it is
<BR>
equivalent to NOTHING. This is uncannily like the Hindu Brahman. The
<BR>
quintessence of thoughtless consciousness that underlies maya:  the universe
<BR>
of physics &amp; all mentality.
<BR>
<P>This &quot;everything is nothing&quot; kills the paradoxes that might be wont to rear
<BR>
their ugly heads.
<BR>
<P>FIFTH, what does this do for the singularity, SETI etc? Well, I'm sorry to
<BR>
say that intelligent life doesn't exist on earth. Or what we conclude is
<BR>
intellligence is extremely fragile and ephemeral in the grand scheme of
<BR>
things.
<BR>
<P>The vast majority of techincally adept sentients quickly evolve to a state
<BR>
where their non-Born QWFs give them release from this universe... they've
<BR>
disappeared from our physical cosmos and are now part of that amorphous
<BR>
Brahman, the hyperuniverse.
<BR>
<P>Can we with our limited pattern-detection disembed them from thence?
<BR>
<P>Sic transit gloria mundi, Extropians!

Subject: Re: psi as a boundary breaking possibility
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Scerir's post involving the use of quantum random number generators, etc...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in conjunction with &quot;psi&quot; phenomena caused a bunch of things I've been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reading to crystallize into a fairly complicated question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;First, some background.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've just finished reading Chalmer's &quot;The Conscious Mind.&quot; Towards the end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of that book Chalmers has a chapter in which he discusses several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interpretations of quantum mechanics and their relationship towards his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;theory of consciousness. As I understand his theory, consciousness is one
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the postulated fundamental &quot;things&quot; in the universe, along with space/time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and mass/energy, but it is invariably associated with certain patterns of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter/energy. Sort of straddling the fence between matieralism and
</EM><BR>
dualism,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I thought. At least knowing where he was going made slogging through all
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;epistimelogy easier :) He spends a significant part of this chapter on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Everett Interpretation, which, as I understood it, says that, in lieu of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there being some mechanism associated with consciousness that causes spread
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out probability waves to &quot;collapse&quot; into discrete conventional histories,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our minds are in the same superposition, and thus only perceive a small
</EM><BR>
part
<BR>
<EM>&gt;of the massive wave function that is reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've also just recently re-read Greg Egan's Diaspora, in which (no
</EM><BR>
spoilers)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;femtomachines, the nuclear particle equivalent of molecular nanotechnology,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;play a prominent role.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Molecular nanotechnonological devices are orders of magnitude too large to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience quantum effects, but there seems to be no fundamental
</EM><BR>
engineering
<BR>
<EM>&gt;issues (that an SI couldn't resolve :)) preventing femtomachines being
</EM><BR>
built
<BR>
<EM>&gt;small enough to enter into quantum superpositions with other femtomachines,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or other particles of similar size.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Accordingly, postulate the existence of a femto-robot. A device
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;approxiamately the size of a large particle that can manipulate other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;particles it's size and smaller, but be small enough to be swallowed in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quantum superpsoition with other particles, like the particles that form
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;bits in the register of a quantum computer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What would be the effect on the robot's functioning, if any, if it is
</EM><BR>
placed
<BR>
<EM>&gt;into superposition with a series of particles, with preprogrammed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instructions to perform some manipulation of those particles within the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;superposed state? What if the robot was placed in superpsotiion with
</EM><BR>
another
<BR>
<EM>&gt;robot with different programming? Of course I realize that the particles in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;superposition must remain completely separated form the outside environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the duration of the superposition, but the examples I've seen (quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasonably) did not mention the possibility of particles with behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;orders of magnitude more complex then the behavior of a normal electron :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And what relation does any of this blue-sky speculation have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-locality, superposition, wave function collapse, and/or other quantum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;phenomenon generally regarded as the most plausible physical causes of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatever &quot;psi&quot; phenomenon may exist?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If anyone has any idea, or if anyone knows whether the whole mental model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that spawned this question is fundamentally broken :), by all means, let me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;We learn by asking questions...

<EM>&gt;  Well, a clean source of random numbers is, perhaps, also this one

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In the far future you could also use quantum analyzers, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  could also perform psi experiments by means of ... quantum robots!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  An interesting argument is the Reichenbach's common cause principle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  which is often called into question when they perform experiments about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (quantum) nonlocality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9806074">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9806074</A>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Classical (non quantum) nonlocality was sometimes theoretically showed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (superluminal solutions of Maxwell field, etc.) i:e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003075">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003075</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A quantum-informational methodology (about cognitive,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  psychological, social ans anomalous! phenomena) was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sometimes sketched, i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003016">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003016</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  but I think that the s.c. *structural instability* criterion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is more useful, if we want to build a consistent theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of psi phenomena.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The Geneva quantum optics group is working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  very hard on nonlocality, *cosmic* frame, special relativity,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a review article is:

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A very strange *ghost* nonlocality was also shown recently
