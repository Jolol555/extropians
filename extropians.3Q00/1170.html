<P>
The central questions for the future tell us who we are, as individuals and 
<BR>
as society. Do we seek stasis- a regulated, constructed world? Or do we 
<BR>
welcome dynamism, a world of constant creation, constant discoveries, and 
<BR>
constant competition? Do we value stability and control, or development and 
<BR>
learning? Are we afraid of the future, and see the development of technology 
<BR>
and society as something dangerous? Or do we see these developments as an 
<BR>
expression of human creativity and the future as something good? Do we think 
<BR>
that development demands central planning, or do we see it as a 
<BR>
decentralised, evolutionary process? Do we think that mistakes will turn 
<BR>
into permanent catastrophes, or are they the side- products of 
<BR>
experimentation, which can be corrected? Do we seek the predictable, or are 
<BR>
we delighted by surprises? These two opposites, stasis and dynamism, are 
<BR>
increasingly dominating our political, intellectual, and cultural 
<BR>
landscapes. The central questions of our time are about how we should handle 
<BR>
the future. And these questions form a sharp demarcation line. The future is 
<BR>
a &quot;growing, complex mess&quot;. This &quot;mess&quot; doesn't consist of disorder, but an 
<BR>
order that's unpredictable, spontaneous, and constantly changing, a pattern 
<BR>
formed by billions of not co-ordinated of themselves independent decisions. 
<BR>
This pattern doesn't just contain some high technological gadgets, but the 
<BR>
full spectrum of life. When people create and sell products and services, 
<BR>
when they clothe and express themselves in new ways, when they form families 
<BR>
and choose the place to live in, make medical decisions or seek insight to 
<BR>
their lives, explore the universe and invent new forms of art. These actions 
<BR>
create a future nobody can see, a future that is dynamic and that has an 
<BR>
inherent instability. This instability, or rather our awareness of it, is 
<BR>
heightened by the flow of contemporary life- by the ease with which ideas 
<BR>
and messages, goods and people, transcend boundaries, by technology that 
<BR>
transcend the swiftness of the human mind, and the limitations of the human 
<BR>
body. Of the universal lubricants of trade and popular culture, of the 
<BR>
dissolvement or restructuring of established institutions, and of the 
<BR>
synthesis between the new and the old, between East and West- that seemingly 
<BR>
every product of human culture is combined and recombined. We live in a time 
<BR>
of creation of huge proportions. But this creation generates change, and 
<BR>
this change draws enemies, both those that act in the name of ideas and for 
<BR>
their own sake. With a few exceptions the enemies of the future don't direct 
<BR>
their attacks on creativity itself but on the dynamic processes that carry 
<BR>
it. Finally the free market is seen as a strong force of social change, 
<BR>
cultural, and technological innovation, by some seen as liberation, by 
<BR>
others as a threat. The same goes for the markets of ideas: for freedom of 
<BR>
expression, and world- spanning communication, for experimenting in 
<BR>
lifestyles, for scientific research, artistic expression and technological 
<BR>
innovation. All these processes form an unpredictable and unknown future. 
<BR>
Some people rejoice when they see so many different, decentralised, choice- 
<BR>
generating systems, even if they don't approve of the individual choices. 
<BR>
Others cringe back. In their quest for stability and control they seek to 
<BR>
eliminate and slow down these unreliable and &quot;too creative&quot; forces. Stasists 
<BR>
and dynamists are separated both by simple, short-sighted political 
<BR>
questions, and by a fundamental difference in worldview. They get into 
<BR>
conflict on both considering the nature of development and thedesirabilityy 
<BR>
of it. Do you need a plan to reach a certain goal? Or is it a boundless 
<BR>
process of exploration and discoveries? Is the striving for better terms of 
<BR>
life an expression of destructive, nihilistic dissatisfaction, or of the 
<BR>
best qualities of humanity? Is development a result of puritan inhibition, 
<BR>
or of a playful mind? Stasis's and dynamists have different opinions of the 
<BR>
boundaries and usefulness of knowledge. Stasis's demand that knowledge must 
<BR>
be formulated and easily divided by many. Dynamists appreciate the 
<BR>
distributed, and often tacit knowledge, they acknowledge the limitations of 
<BR>
the human intellect as well as revering learning. These conflicts lead to 
<BR>
very different opinions of what are good institutions and rules. Stasists 
<BR>
search for specific ways to rule and control every new situation. Dynamists 
<BR>
want to limit common regulations to seldom changed principles with a broad 
<BR>
implementation, in whose boundary people have the right to create and try on 
<BR>
uncountable combinations. Stasists demand that their detailed rules must be 
<BR>
forced upon everyone, while dynamists prefer competing groups with different 
<BR>
rules. These conflicts have severe political repercussions that affect us on 
<BR>
a much deeper level than political campaigns and legislation. They affect 
<BR>
our basic view on how philosophical, political, economic, social, 
<BR>
intellectual, and cultural systems work, what these systems should value, 
<BR>
and their meaning.
<BR>
<P>And where does transhumanism fit into this? Well by being the staunch 
<BR>
supporter of the dynamist view...
<BR>
Or at least it should be...
