Resending because I did not get a copy of this last night.

<EM> &gt; &gt; In particular, I believe one should avoid just taking what one knows to
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; true and reclassifying it as axiomatic.  For instance, my eye color,
</EM><BR>
which I
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; see every time I look in the mirror is not, for me, an axiom.  Surely, I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; know it.  I know it's true -- in the context of my knowledge.  But it is
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; an axiom.  It doesn't underly all of my knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Well, would you consider &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; as true knowledge or as axiomatic?
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but not axiomatic -- at least, not in the sense I use the term.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If &quot;reality = all that exists&quot; isn't axiomatic, but rather a universal
</EM><BR>
truth,
<BR>
<EM> &gt; that's okay with me.  I just think of it as a definition.
</EM><BR>
<P>The above equality is a definition, not an axiom.  &quot;Reality is real&quot; is an
<BR>
axiom.:)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; I think Jason Joel Thompson meant something more than that.  Though I
</EM><BR>
agree
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; with you that reality is unitary, I think he meant that the unification
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; might only take place in the mind.  In other words, that collecting all
</EM><BR>
real
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; things into &quot;reality&quot; is no more than a mental shorthand and that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; metaphysically reality -- all the real things -- might be separate and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; unrelated.  I would take this to include stuff not perceived or known
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; therefore not unified by any mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I think this conversation originated with Jason Joel Thompson
</EM><BR>
contradicting
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Eliezer's statement:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;There is only one reality&quot; -- which disagreement I took for obstinance,
</EM><BR>
because
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Eli's statement seems to me as self-evident as the statement that 2 + 2 =
</EM><BR>
4.
<BR>
<P>There's a difference between self-evident and obvious or well known.
<BR>
Self-evident means something that gives evidence for itself.  Axioms and
<BR>
axiomatic concepts are like that.  They give evidence for themselves -- to
<BR>
be aware of them requires mere awareness and conceptualizing from that; to
<BR>
deny them involves contradiction.  Obvious means something which something
<BR>
we need not debate -- and this definitely depends on context.  Tensor
<BR>
calculus is obvious to the GTR crowd, but not to, say, your average person.
<BR>
Well known is much the same.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I mean, of course someone could argue that 2 + 2 = 5 (for very large
</EM><BR>
values of
<BR>
<EM> &gt; 2). But to spend more than a few sentences voicing disagreement seems
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; extravagant if not confrontational.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree here, though such obvious facts often need to be backed up by more
<BR>
than just pointing out they are obvious.  To fail to do so often invites bad
<BR>
philosophy in.
<BR>
<P>But none of this seems to answer Jason's original concern.  (I still have a
<BR>
few posts to catch up on, but now I must leave your reality temporarily...:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
