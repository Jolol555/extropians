<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems almost comical to consider these questions.  Uploads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somehow don't fit into the world as we know it.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the idea of an &quot;upload&quot; is still contained a similar
<BR>
size/complexity identity as a single conscious person, even though
<BR>
this person is virtual or more or less independent of the particular
<BR>
hardware.  But this is only a small fraction of the problem.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we can upload we'll also be able to enlarge/share
<BR>
conscious experience.  For example, imagine a brain being enhanced
<BR>
(including additional visual cortexes, auditory systems, tactile
<BR>
awareness cortexes...)  to not only have conscious knowledge of the
<BR>
feelings going on in you're physical body but also of what is going on
<BR>
in another's body / brain / consciousness all integrated into one
<BR>
subjective awareness.  When having sex, for example, you experience all
<BR>
the sensations / awareness going on, not just half of them like we are
<BR>
limited to today.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this still isn't &quot;sharing&quot; consciousness.  This is just
<BR>
augmenting you're brain so you can feel the same thing you're partner
<BR>
is aware of, if they are willing to open a neural sensor channel to
<BR>
you're augmented awareness cortex that can handle it and make you
<BR>
conscious of both at the same time.  What happens when we actually
<BR>
merge, share, and grow actual consciousness awareness of two conscious
<BR>
uploads or people or whatever?  Perhaps in some virtual brain located
<BR>
in some stationary physical vault, occasionally moving to another
<BR>
vault/brain that is better, cheaper, in some more accommodating
<BR>
country or whatever, communicating with 4 or 5 or more now remotely
<BR>
controlled copies of the original being's bodies out doing the actual
<BR>
living in various parts of the solar system...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire concept of what a &quot;person&quot; or &quot;upload&quot; is quickly
<BR>
becomes meaningless, making almost everything in today's person based
<BR>
society, very &quot;comical&quot;.  But that doesn't mean there will not be
<BR>
infinitely more meaning in that brave new world of discovery and
<BR>
shared experience we find... as we all grow and merge to likely
<BR>
ultimately become one supper all powerful all knowing all aware being.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely it will simply follow the corporate model.  How big can
<BR>
a company get?  How interdependent and part of each other can
<BR>
companies become?  Do big companies make it impossible for small
<BR>
companies to exist?  The size of a company is somewhat limited by
<BR>
technology, ability to communicate and so on.  Similarly, the size of
<BR>
conscious entities is limited by our ability to enginer ever larger
<BR>
conscious / shared brains right?  As we grow, split, merge, just like
<BR>
in the corporate world, you legally define how you want things to work
<BR>
as you do this and legally set things up according to how you want
<BR>
things to happen, limited only by what technology can do, until
<BR>
technology grows and much more is possible so you do it all again...
