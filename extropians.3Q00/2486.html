<P><EM>&gt;Amara, 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't read high-level (pun acknowledged, but not intended) physics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;very well.
</EM><BR>
<P>I remade the Web site anyway, since it was &quot;too flat&quot; before, and now
<BR>
it's layered better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Can you say whether this work has implications for our continuing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability to put up satellites and to leave Earth orbit? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P>---------------------
<BR>
See the number of abstracts at the recent (past) COSPAR meeting on this 
<BR>
topic.

<P>B0.1/PEDAS1 Space Debris
<BR>
<P>Operations in Earth orbit have generated both large and small
<BR>
particulates which remain in orbit for extended periods and cause a
<BR>
flux which exceeds the interplanetary meteoroid flux. The meeting will
<BR>
address techniques to measure the space debris and near-Earth
<BR>
meteoroid population, the results of data taken from the ground and in
<BR>
space to measure the environment, the results of analyses of
<BR>
spacecraft returned from space, methods and results of modeling and
<BR>
supporting ground tests to predict the environment over short and long
<BR>
time intervals, and atmospheric reentry of orbiting objects including
<BR>
the fragmentation process. The meeting will also discuss hypervelocity
<BR>
impacts, the effects of impacting debris on spacecraft structures and
<BR>
instrumentation, and detrimental effects of space debris on space
<BR>
activities and research, e.g. astronomy. The meeting will examine new
<BR>
developments which may influence the debris environment such as
<BR>
satellite constellations. Measures will be addressed to reduce the
<BR>
growth of the debris population and keep the hazard to operational
<BR>
spacecraft within tolerable limits.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>March 19-21 2001 there is a conference: Third European Conference on Space
<BR>
Debris in ESOC, Damstadt, Germany. Contact W. Flury (<A HREF="mailto:wflury@soc.esa.de?Subject=Re:%20Dust%20in%20Earth's%20Magnetosphere&In-Reply-To=&lt;200008031632.SAA27602@cassini.mpi-hd.mpg.de&gt;">wflury@soc.esa.de</A>)
<BR>
for information.
<BR>
<P>------------------------
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Is the situation with microparticles going to get continually worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over some time frame?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. 
<BR>
<P>Since 1957, more than 4000 space launches have occurred. About 8500
<BR>
objects, larger than 10cm are being tracked in Earth orbit, only
<BR>
about 700 of those are spacecraft. About 100 000 to 150 000 objects,
<BR>
larger than 1cm, are not being tracked.
<BR>
<P>Objects 1cm and larger can destroy a spacecraft. Those particles, can
<BR>
easily have relative velocities of tens of km/sec, which act like a
<BR>
bullet hitting the spacecraft.
<BR>
<P>[For example, About the small particles that worry spacecraft
<BR>
operators: the Cassini mission designers are planning now the Saturn
<BR>
ring-plane crossing sequences, about 5 years from now, and yes indeed,
<BR>
they are worried about the big dust particles &gt;1cm, that they might
<BR>
encounter. Of course us dust people want to sample the dust, but we
<BR>
like the &quot;smaller&quot; dust, and we certainly don't want the spacecraft
<BR>
damaged!]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Are the negative potentials in themselves harmful to vehicles either in or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transiting through the magnetosphere? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. Portions of spacecraft have been observed to charge to many
<BR>
kVolts (negative) during Earth substorms and those spacecraft surfaces
<BR>
can suffer discharges. However, spacecraft surfaces are *supposed* to
<BR>
be (designed) nonconducting, but sometimes they are not. The ones that
<BR>
are not could experience difficulties.
<BR>
<P>I've heard stories of objects from Earth orbit being brought back to
<BR>
Earth for examination (for example, solar panels from HST), and the
<BR>
objects stored charges for months (process: &quot;internal charging&quot;),
<BR>
resulting in a strong electrical discharge when someone/something
<BR>
tried to handle the object.
<BR>
<P>A good old reference:
<BR>
_Photon and Particle interactions with Surfaces in Space_
<BR>
R.J.L. Grard, editor, Reidel, 1973.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Any chance of harnessing this kind 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of effect to clean out some of the debris? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting idea. Don't know.
