<EM>&gt; This is good news, now not only is FM-2030 in the excellent hands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the folks at Alcor, but apparently he was suspended using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent breakthrough in protocol. Very good news indeed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sadly, Brian, no...
<BR>
<P>Alcor used the same base perfusate and cryoprotectant as usual.  They
<BR>
weren't quite set up for the new system yet.  If he had held on for even a
<BR>
couple more weeks, things might have been different. They *are* dancing as
<BR>
fast as they can... 
<BR>
<P>What was truly stunning, though, was the success of the new surgical
<BR>
technique Linda described in another post.  FM arrested without any
<BR>
warning, which wound up involving ER doctors, police, coroners and the
<BR>
like.  Between that and bad airline scheduling, there was a *very* long
<BR>
transport to Alcor, and no local support other than delayed ice cooling.
<BR>
<P>In the past, we would have been sadly shaking our heads and preparing a
<BR>
&quot;straight freeze&quot; i.e. without cryoprotection.  When such cases had been
<BR>
attempted before, disasterous edema and minimal cryoprotection resulted.
<BR>
<P>However, with FM they decided to try the new surgical procedure.  It
<BR>
a enabled lower pressure and flow than had ever been done before, and
<BR>
Alcor's surgeon had been able to deal with blockages.  To almost
<BR>
everyone's suprise, the capillary bed appeared intact, and with
<BR>
*extremely* careful control of the cryoprotectant ramp and pressure, they
<BR>
were able to prevent edema and cryoprotect FM to a level as high as any of
<BR>
Alcor's *best* cases in the past.  
<BR>
<P>This bodes well not only for the &quot;perfect&quot; cases that will benefit the
<BR>
most from the new protocol, but also for the majority of cases where there
<BR>
is no warning and where no stand-by was in place.
<BR>
<P>This is very good news.
