<EM>&gt;I have a friend who was in a near-fatal motorcycle accident and had a NDE on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the road, and later in the hospital. She says she is no longer afraid of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dying. She also descibres a ghost who followed her throughout her house for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a few months when she was 16. She gave a physical description of the ghost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as a ashen faced 40ish man, wearing a Frank Sinatra type hat (I know there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is a name for that). It sounded to me like she was describing William
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Burroughs. I showed her a picture of him and she was startled by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resemblance. I know of at least 4 other people who have described a &quot;ghost&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the exact same appearance (all of them live in Utah). I have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insightful comment on this, I just thought it was interesting. I personally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do not believe they were actually being trailed by a sentient entity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know you were wondering where I have been...alas, the wait is no longer.
<BR>
<P>I had a near death experience last month.  Actually, technically it was a death
<BR>
experience.  I stopped breathing and passed  out.   Let me tell you. I must be
<BR>
one screwed up dude.  Most people see a bright light and have a very peaceful
<BR>
experience on there way up to  heaven... Not me.  First of all, there was no
<BR>
white light. Second of all, instead of seeing god, I found myself in hell and
<BR>
met the devil himself.  Satan is actually a pretty nice dude, and quite funny I
<BR>
might add. It  was no dream, it was so sooo real.
<BR>
You will be quite pleased to know that I have negotiated an express check-in for
<BR>
all Extropy subscribers for when the time is ripe. (He said that just
<BR>
being an Extropy  subscriber did not qualify in itself for entry, and
<BR>
urged those of you  who are not Extropy subscribers, to try it out and
<BR>
he will at least  consider letting you in). I got there during orientation and
<BR>
was fascinated.
<BR>
<P>All right then...Hello, nice to see you all again.  In case you haven't noticed,
<BR>
and to many of your's surprise ... you are now, in hell.  I am the Devil, but
<BR>
you can call me Spike if you like. We like to keep things a bit informal here,
<BR>
as well as infernal. That's just a little joke.
<BR>
<P>Welcome all. We have a saying for all newcomers. Yesterday, was the last day of
<BR>
the rest of your life.
<BR>
<P>Now, you are all here for... eternity, which I hardly need to tell you, is sort
<BR>
of a long time, so you get to know everyone pretty well by the  end. But for
<BR>
now, I'm going to have to split you up into groups.
<BR>
<P>Before we move on, are there any questions???
<BR>
.
<BR>
.
<BR>
.
<BR>
No, although there is a resemblance, this is not Los Angeles.
<BR>
<P>Any More? ... Yes...
<BR>
.
<BR>
.
<BR>
.
<BR>
<P>No, I'm afraid that we don't have any toilets here. If you had read your Bible,
<BR>
you might have seen that it was damnation, WITHOUT relief.  So if you didn't go
<BR>
before you came, I am afraid you are not going to  enjoy yourselves very much.
<BR>
Of course, I believe that's the idea.  Oh yes, I do have one bit of good
<BR>
news for you ... that we have finally been able to put an end to all your junk
<BR>
e-mail.
<BR>
<P>Any other Questions?
<BR>
<P>No, we're not splitting you into smokers and non smokers...This isn't
<BR>
Spago's
<BR>
<P>.
<BR>
.
<BR>
.
<BR>
<P>No, I'm afraid not. Although when you were alive, life was the most precious
<BR>
thing that you had, you can see that it has absolutely zero trade in value.
<BR>
<P>Yes...You there with the angel wings and the pretty badly beaten  body??? No,
<BR>
it is no mistake. God sent you to me because you dissed him pretty bad. That was
<BR>
no time to say &quot;Putz, now you give me the wings. You couldn't have given me them
<BR>
before the bungee-jumping accident?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Right then, lets split you up then. Can you all hear me? Can you hear me at the
<BR>
rack?   Allright.
<BR>
<P>Murderers over here. Thank you.
<BR>
<P>Looters and pillagers over there. Thieves, if you could join them ...and
<BR>
Lawyers.
<BR>
<P>Fornicators...if you could step forward. Holy smoke, there are a lot of you. If
<BR>
I
<BR>
could just split you into groups...Adulterers , and the rest.  Adulterers...If
<BR>
you could form a line behind that teeny guillotine.
<BR>
<P>Masturbators...could you give them a hand?
<BR>
<P>S &amp; M fans. You can take any spot you like. Think of this as your  slice of
<BR>
heaven.
<BR>
<P>Americans...are you here??? I do apologize, but it seems that God had a bit of a
<BR>
fight with your founding fathers and damned the entire race  in perpetuity. He
<BR>
sends particular condolences to Mormons, who he
<BR>
realizes put in a lot of work. That's the way the wafer crumbles.
<BR>
<P>The Iranians, I'm afraid can't be with us. Someone has been holding them in
<BR>
purgatory for a very long time.
<BR>
<P>Sodomites, could you back up there against the wall.
<BR>
<P>Athiests...Athiests over here please ... You must be surprised as all  hell.
<BR>
<P>And, hmmm, Christians...Christians, are you here? Ah yes, I'm sorry,  but I am
<BR>
afraid, the Jews were right.
<BR>
<P>Moonies, maniacs, marmite eaters, male models, masochists,  mass murderers and
<BR>
masseurs, could you just take a pew at the back ...  with the Methodists. Now
<BR>
you're the lot that used to kill whales, is that right? Ah yes, I must remember,
<BR>
I have some strips to tear off of your bastard hides.
<BR>
<P>Golfers ...Golfers ...Can you step up and place your balls on the table?
<BR>
<P>OK, can I have all the husbands who had flatulence problems down wind by those
<BR>
huge vats of baked beans ... Thank you
<BR>
<P>Members of the oil Cartel...could you line up behind them please??? Now lets see
<BR>
if you can control the gas output.
<BR>
<P>Now all those of you who saw Monty Python's life of Brian ... I'm afraid he
<BR>
can't take a joke after all.
<BR>
<P>It seems like we have a special guest with us today. Lorena Bobbit, is with us.
<BR>
Seems as though she died in a car crash yesterday? My hat's off to the dick that
<BR>
cut her off!
<BR>
<P>One more thing. We are trying to implement some kind of exchange scheme with the
<BR>
Lord God Almighty, or Harold as I like to call him. Some of you will travel up
<BR>
and have a decay in heaven...and we will be having some angels down here. Now I
<BR>
hardly need to tell you that in heaven you will be expected to behave in an
<BR>
exemplary manner, now, so I hope you do the exact opposite. Tear off their
<BR>
wings,
<BR>
and use their halos for frisbee practice.
<BR>
<P>Well I have to go now, unfortunately, but Beelzebub will show you the  ropes ...
<BR>
and the chains and electrodes.
