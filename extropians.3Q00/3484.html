<EM>&gt;  I think transhumanism can do a great deal of good by pointing at these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  interrelations, making people realise that they cannot have (say)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  advanced medicine without genetic engineering or a complex chemical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  infrastructure or their favorite foreign foods without a globalised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  market (or introduced species at home). This is the practical part,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  but we should not be afraid of dealing with the ethical/spiritual side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  too - we must be able to make a convincing argument for the ethics of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  our ideas.  Let's remind people that we are not just children of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Mother Earth but of Father Sun too - and in the long run we might want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to visit him.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah ... finally, a productive thread! Thanks Corwyn, Anders.
<BR>
<P>While I would shy away from Corwyn's term &quot;Fundamentalist Left (term is 
<BR>
baiting, reactionary) I have a real hard time with the schism in the common 
<BR>
green thinking:
<BR>
<P>I was having a discussion with a very talented and passionate artist about 
<BR>
genetic food. Worried about the non-reproductive seeds and the effect on 
<BR>
farmers in third world countries. The y don't like Monsanto, don't trust the 
<BR>
motive for making the non-reproductive corn. OK, I respect that. That's 
<BR>
against LIFE! Concern the non-reproductive seeds will make the farmers 
<BR>
dependent on the company. OK I respect that, check your research, etc.... But 
<BR>
then - she says: And, genetically engineered HUMANS ... that would be worse, 
<BR>
why in India, now that they can genetically engineer the SEX of the baby, 
<BR>
they're all gonna ask for BOYS. and begins a rant on sexism in the third 
<BR>
world, Afghanistan, etc., and how this will escalate it.
<BR>
<P>So I say the obvious to all of us here: Look! Engineers and technology are 
<BR>
not to blame for the horrible treatment of women -- in fact they are great 
<BR>
equalizers -- it is fundamental religion that is responsible for much of the 
<BR>
degradation and segregation (for example Afghanistan) - and the origin of all 
<BR>
this misogynistic attitude towards baby girls, isn't it? 
<BR>
Hey, I see protest for all sorts of technology and warfare, but when it comes 
<BR>
to protesting horribly oppressive religion, which is the cause of most of the 
<BR>
wars and torture, where are all you so called &quot;caring&quot; people? Why don't the 
<BR>
masses turn out to violently protest these outdated horrors - if you want to 
<BR>
talk about 'against LIFE!' 
<BR>
<P>She admitted it, you are right Nadia, we do not criticize come one's 
<BR>
SPIRITUAL beliefs, that is taboo. Hmm... 
<BR>
<P>I sort of don't think she's gonna act on it. 
<BR>
<P>It's not that the left is religious, I don't see it that way. What we 
<BR>
culturally are, left, center, out to lunch and/or right, is scared and overly 
<BR>
polite regarding that taboo subject. The sacred cow. It's some kind of 
<BR>
freakish phenomenon built right into the religion meme.
<BR>
<P>It is part of the durability factor.
