<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Destination Mir will Launch on NBC
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Mark Burnett, producer of the hit show &quot;Survivor&quot;, has sold the rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     to his new show, &quot;Destination Mir&quot; to NBC for $40 million. The show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     will follow a group of 13-15 would-be cosmonauts as they train for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     a trip to the Mir space station. Each week, a contestant will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     removed by Russian Space Officials until the final winner is launched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     into orbit on a special, live broadcast. Half of the money will go to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     MirCorp, to help cover the costs of the trip.  As part of the deal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     NBC has agreed to run an hour long, Burnett-produced show about Dennis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Tito, the businessman who paid $20 million for the chance to fly on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Mir next year. &quot;Destination Mir&quot; will air in late 2001, early 2002.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sounds interesting, but they need to come up with a better way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; winnowing the field.  Just having some faceless Russian bureaucrats tap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a guy on the shoulder and send him outside won't work.  Hmmm, maybe a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Stalinesque approach... it's the middle of the night, the door is thrown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open, our hapless hero throws up his hands against the light as storm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; troopers with attack guards hustle him out... and he's never seen again.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even better, the losers get exiled to star in Survivor IV: Kamchatka Paradise
<BR>
Lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Seriously, the most interesting part of the Survivor show was the politics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and strategy involved in seeing who would get voted off.  Just having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the space agency officials decide won't work.  They need to come up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some fair but dramatically interesting way to kick people off.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think they will probably have immunity challenge type competitions, and the
<BR>
worst performers get bumped. They'll probably also broadcast the meetings of the
<BR>
agency guys when they decide who to axe.
