Apocalyptic Optimism
<BR>
Menzel and D'Aluisio foresee a superintelligent hybrid species
<BR>
<P>Robo sapiens:
<BR>
Evolution of a New Species
<BR>
by Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio
<BR>
The MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 2000 ($29.95)
<BR>
<P>REVIEWER_VERNOR VINGE
<BR>
Computers are the most important thing to come along since ....&quot; It would be
<BR>
interesting to ask people from over the past 30 years to complete the
<BR>
preceding sentence. In the 1970s most people might finish the sentence with
<BR>
&quot;television&quot; or &quot;the automobile&quot; or even &quot;atomic energy.&quot; In the 1990s the
<BR>
ante was raised, and I imagine that the average person would complete the
<BR>
sentence with &quot;the industrial revolution&quot; or even &quot;the invention of
<BR>
writing.&quot; Now, as the 21st century dawns, some would say: &quot;Computers are the
<BR>
most important thing to come along since the rise of humankind on Earth.&quot;
<BR>
Even this last comparison may be conservative. Computer hardware power is
<BR>
doubling every two years or so. If that trend continues, then in another 20
<BR>
years, our machines will be more powerful than many estimates of human
<BR>
brainpower.
<BR>
These supermachines might come about in several ways. In their book Robo
<BR>
sapiens, Peter Menzel and Faith D'Aluisio examine one of the most
<BR>
significant and plausible possibilities. The prospect of their title is
<BR>
explained on the very first page of the introduction: &quot;Robo sapiens: ... A
<BR>
hybrid species of human and robot with intelligence vastly superior to that
<BR>
of purely biological mankind; began to emerge in the twenty-first century.&quot;
<BR>
After their excellent introductory comments, the authors indulge in little
<BR>
speculation. Instead they show us the current state of the art. Photographer
<BR>
Menzel and journalist D'Aluisio traveled to dozens of research sites around
<BR>
the world and conducted what must be hundreds of interviews. They have
<BR>
organized their work into 53 short chapters. Each consists of one or more
<BR>
interviews, photos of the robots, and sidebars giving project specifications
<BR>
and background information.
<BR>
Project by project, they build the overview for us. We see the opinions that
<BR>
researchers have of the field and of one another's work. We see the conþicts
<BR>
that exist among different research approaches. No consensus has been
<BR>
reached as to the path to success or what may be possible. We are in the
<BR>
midst of an intellectual turmoil, driven by human genius and the steadily
<BR>
increasing power of our computer hardware.
<BR>
The breadth of research projects is enormous. We are introduced to
<BR>
autonomous devices and teloperated ones, uncrewed rovers and robotic
<BR>
aircraft and pipeline crawlers. Pets and companions, prosthetics and
<BR>
hands-at-a-distance, housekeepers and welders, weapons and guardians-someone
<BR>
somewhere has found money (military, commercial, medical) to work on these
<BR>
possibilities. Many researchers are trying to build machines by imitating
<BR>
life-and some bioscientists are using robot models to improve their
<BR>
understanding of life.
<BR>
It is very difficult to write clearly and simply about such things and still
<BR>
remain faithful to the underlying technology. Menzel and D'Aluisio
<BR>
accomplish this feat. The interviews and sidebars are consistently
<BR>
intriguing but also show great effort in avoiding the misinterpretations
<BR>
that could come from comparing so many different research enterprises.
<BR>
(Considering the range of research studied, an appendix categorizing the
<BR>
different projects would have been helpful.)
<BR>
Many of the robots are mechanically complex. Often they are unlike anything
<BR>
we have seen before. Imagine that you had never seen a horse: you would need
<BR>
clear and objective pictures to get a good idea of the creature's
<BR>
appearance. Similarly, Menzel's color photos are essential to understanding
<BR>
the projects described. The photos are beautiful and, for the most part,
<BR>
extremely effective. In a few cases, however, the higher-level goals of the
<BR>
photography make the details of the machines unclear-for example, the
<BR>
motion-blurring effect used in picturing the M.I.T. Spring flamingo robot on
<BR>
page nine or the Honda P3 robot on page 34 [see opposite page].
<BR>
The chapters related to robotic pets and artificial affect are especially
<BR>
fascinating. Setting aside issues of intelligence and mobility, when you pat
<BR>
your dog on the head and look into its eyes, you can see that someone is
<BR>
home. Very few of us would say any such thing about a machine. What's
<BR>
missing from the machine? Perhaps it's simply that our instincts say &quot;warm,
<BR>
soft, responsive creature with large dark eyes&quot; = &quot;living being with a
<BR>
soul.&quot; Commercial products such as Sony's AIBO and (soon) Hasbro/iRobot's My
<BR>
Real Baby are early attempts to address this issue. Will people be
<BR>
attracted, repelled or simply bored by such creations?
<BR>
The arrival of Robo sapiens is not assured. Maybe we have not yet stumbled
<BR>
on some basic impossibility. Or maybe our researchers are ignoring some
<BR>
critical technique: to one degree or another, almost everyone interviewed is
<BR>
working from the bottom up, imitating the lower levels of animal capability
<BR>
with a view toward later building the higher functions. The alternative,
<BR>
top-down approach would seek to model the highest functions of thought
<BR>
first, perhaps in a supercomputer or computer network-and then, with luck,
<BR>
the hands and legs and wheels would be easy add-ons. For the past 10 or 15
<BR>
years, the top-down approach has been in eclipse.
<BR>
A theme builds through the interviews: living creatures are superior in
<BR>
almost every way to existing machines. Even some of the superiorities that
<BR>
we typically grant machines over animals-durability, speed, strength-do not
<BR>
hold in a natural environment. Similarly, real-time computations that
<BR>
involve reasoning with the chaos of the material world are also beyond the
<BR>
computers we have now.
<BR>
But remember, computer power is doubling about every two years. What we see
<BR>
now in robotics and AI research is still the historic beginning. Menzel and
<BR>
D'Aluisio have given us a richly detailed picture of this tumult as it is at
<BR>
the end of the 20th century. Their book provides a baseline for comparison
<BR>
with projects in the years ahead. What develops in the next 10 years should
<BR>
yield strong evidence about where things are going. If we get effective
<BR>
household robots, if we get vehicles that can navigate real terrain
<BR>
autonomously, if we get lovable robotic pets ... then we are on track to
<BR>
create something very like Robo sapiens.
