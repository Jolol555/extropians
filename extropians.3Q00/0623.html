<P><EM>    &gt;Hey I bet John Clarke is enjoying all this...  {8-]
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all, I didn't care how the test turned out because we could not
<BR>
learn anything from it. Back in 1997 there was a ABM test that used an
<BR>
unrealistically small number of decoys, only 10, a real enemy would use
<BR>
between ten and a hundred times as many. Nevertheless the test failed,
<BR>
the system was hopelessly confused by only 10 decoys and could not find
<BR>
the warhead. After 3 years of work and billions of dollars they came up with
<BR>
a solution, dumb down the test. Friday's test had just 1 (ONE!) perfectly
<BR>
spherical decoy carefully engineered so it had no troublesome irregularities
<BR>
in its RADAR signature and they made sure it was 10 time as reflective as
<BR>
the warhead; then they simply programmed the ABM to go after the weaker of
<BR>
two targets. Needless to say the warhead was not inside a Mylar balloon as
<BR>
it certainly would be in a real attack unless the enemy was brain dead.
<BR>
<P>The way this 100 million dollar experiment was set up there is no way it
<BR>
could yield information that was interesting or useful regardless of how it
<BR>
turned out. This was not Science, this was a stunt designed to do one thing,
<BR>
generate good PR. As it turned out it couldn't even do that.
<BR>
<P>We're not talking about some proof of concept thing, they've been working
<BR>
on this for decades and say it's ready to come out of the lab and enter
<BR>
the real world, but this is the best they could do. Dismal failure or not
<BR>
the promoters want to spend 60 billion (200 billion after the inevitable cost
<BR>
overruns) and build phase one of the stupid thing right now. When that
<BR>
fails they'll want to fix it by going to phase 2, and then you're talking
<BR>
trillions not billions. Besides being such a drain on the economy that the
<BR>
current prosperity could come to an end, a system that didn't work would
<BR>
actually increase the probability of war. After spending all that money
<BR>
our technologically illiterate leaders might start to believe their own press
<BR>
releases and figure, incorrectly, that they could safely strike first and get
<BR>
rid of a certain pest once and for all; the other side might figure, incorrectly,
<BR>
that they're doomed unless they strike first before it's completed.
