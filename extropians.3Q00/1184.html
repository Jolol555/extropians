Friends,
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
What follows is copyrighted by Jeff Davis Friday July 14th, 2000.  If you
<BR>
read further please remit 25 cents.  I wasted a lot of time on this, and as
<BR>
a child, I had to go 25 miles a day through the ice and the snow--on my
<BR>
hands and knees to build character--to get to school.
<BR>
<P>The discussion on this topic has been interesting, spirited, and all over
<BR>
the place.  There's been the political aspect: anarchy, democracy, free
<BR>
market power, and the sweetly anticipated humbling of  the powerful,
<BR>
government-protected, old guard business moguls, by the x-y gen slacker
<BR>
swarm. 
<BR>
<P>The internet like a new clear winner spreads its crystal mycelium to the
<BR>
farthest reaches of the planet, bringing an equal logical catastrophe to
<BR>
the sore old pods of the old world order.  As their warm and comfy, neat
<BR>
and tidy, sweetheart deal starts to crumble, and the chill freshet of a new
<BR>
freedom fills the air, the aged and complacent behemoths begin to slow, and
<BR>
sway, their eyes glaze over, their mentation, anticipating their fate,
<BR>
turns to mulch, and the earth comes up to kiss them with ponderous smaaack.
<BR>
&nbsp;Then, the little warm blooded creatures, those that use to scurry around
<BR>
in the shadows, and tremble in fear at the thunder lizards, come out to
<BR>
fornicate gayly upon the mound of saurus wrecks, chittering the glory of a
<BR>
new age: mutation, cognition, liftoff.  Works every time.  I saw a dead
<BR>
whale on the beach the other day.  A giant gelatinous blob almost
<BR>
unidentifiable as the once magnificent creature.  The waves crashed a few
<BR>
feet away, and the tumbling foam, silent save for a popping effervescence,
<BR>
raced across the sand to tag me unawares and drench me suddenly wide-eyed
<BR>
with its cold surprise. Over top,  the fresh breeze, scuffing across the
<BR>
waves, scuffing from around the world--last stop Hawaii--lapping the arctic
<BR>
cool from the Pacific blue, streamed around a rank mountain of rotting
<BR>
meat, from whose slow putrifactive pyre a pall of ammonia and the mother of
<BR>
all rotten sock collections, rose into the sky.  The bacteria will dance
<BR>
and sing, and the little scuttling crabs party hardy.  Nothing goes to waste.
<BR>
<P>There's been the rational, evolutionary dynamic aspect.
<BR>
<P>Hal got it right.  It's right there for all to see.  Technology ushers in
<BR>
change, destabilizing the old, which tries to hold on against the
<BR>
inevitable.  The new efficiencies of electronic distribution make it
<BR>
cheaper using the net. That alone signals the end of the old business
<BR>
model.  But perhaps even more decisive is that temptress of the novel and
<BR>
hip: convenience.   The x-y-ers don't want to go to the mall, they ewant to
<BR>
esurf the emall.  Get with it Mr. Music man.  It's Napster or Gnutella or
<BR>
freeNet or yournet or it's the LaBrea tar pits, dinoboy.  Evolve or die.  
<BR>
<P>Then there's the raw, Law of the Jungle/Law of the Borg.
<BR>
<P>It's called the market.  Resistance is futile.  Anything that they want,
<BR>
and that the net can supply, they will have.  Napster is the first stroke
<BR>
of Alexander's sword against the Gordian knot.  Gnutella and freeNet are
<BR>
slash two and three.  The man makes rules.  Technology invalidates them.
<BR>
Hoo-flippin-ray.  I've been sittin' here for several years wanting access
<BR>
via the elibrary to every last scrap of human knowledge--call me nerd boy
<BR>
and smile-- fuming that I couldn't get it.  The tech was there.  Finally
<BR>
the twenty-something code geeks said screw this, and came to my rescue.
<BR>
&quot;Get out of the new road if you can't lend a hand, for the times they are
<BR>
a-changing.&quot;  You had your chance, Mr. Publisher man, to get it together
<BR>
and sell your stuff over the net, but no, you were greedy, you wanted to
<BR>
maintain control, to say, &quot;You will pay what we tell you to pay.&quot;  You
<BR>
wanted it all.  But those days are alternate+control+delete, pal.  You'll
<BR>
get what we say you get.  Or you'll get nothing.  Hack that.  It's our turn
<BR>
now.  Call me thief.  Hear me laugh.
<BR>
<P>Formulaic economics.
<BR>
<P>I have no idea what a Metallica album, er, CD, sells for in the store.
<BR>
But, according to supply and demand, if it sold for less dollars, then it
<BR>
would sell more units, and if less still dollars, then still more units.
<BR>
(Up to a point of course.)  So if you sell it on the net for less, much
<BR>
less, then you sell more, much more.  Your market penetration is greater,
<BR>
and your popularity is larger, and your merchandizability is larger.  There
<BR>
would be a little box on the download page which would say purchase this
<BR>
album: for $0.01 &quot;you scumbag thief&quot;, for $0.10 &quot;you cheap-ass loser&quot;, for
<BR>
$0.25 &quot;you just barely qualifying as a supporter of the arts&quot;,  for $0.50
<BR>
&quot;you fair-minded individual, worthy of respect&quot;, for $1.00 &quot;you rock-on
<BR>
righteous metallica fan&quot;.  What's a dollar, after all?  What's a dime?
<BR>
What's your self-respect worth?  The revenues will roll in.  And if this
<BR>
little example does not turn out to be the winner in the Darwinian market
<BR>
battle for the fittest business model, so what?  There will, obviously, be
<BR>
a winner.  People want their MTV, rockers want their groupies, and the
<BR>
lizards want their comissions.  Nature will out.
<BR>
<P>Finally, the ethical issue.
<BR>
<P>I hear a lot of people using the word &quot;thief&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Since the beginning of time the ruling class has either stolen the
<BR>
&quot;government&quot; by main force, or bought the legislative franchise from the
<BR>
current &quot;owners&quot;.  These &quot;thieves&quot; of political priviledge were never
<BR>
called thieves because, quite naturally, the priviledge included the power
<BR>
to define who was a thief.  And it wasn't the franchisees.  The people who
<BR>
started this country (the U.S., though, with only slight variations this
<BR>
story applies more or less equally to every human group--tribe to
<BR>
nation-state--since the completion of the first expansion of primitive man
<BR>
into virgin territory) murdered the ten million native inhabitants and
<BR>
stole their land.  Then they made use of about 25 million people and all
<BR>
the generations of their descendents, violating them in every way
<BR>
imaginable, but most particularly stealing their labor.  Then they took the
<BR>
capital--the gains of their previous criminal enterprise--theft and
<BR>
murder--and they invested it.  And while primarily engaged in the
<BR>
capitalism thing, they were always--like riding a bicycle: you never
<BR>
forget--or is it just a part of the capitalist skill set?-- on the lookout
<BR>
for a chance to steal whatever, whenever, never allowing their villany to
<BR>
dull through disuse.  The very best and boldest thieves achieved the
<BR>
highest social positions, positions of private and public executive
<BR>
responsibility.  Those not strictly qualified for thieving, but with a
<BR>
talent for lying, assisted by constructing a fabric of lies--a history of
<BR>
the nation telling how their culture was benevolent and just-- so that
<BR>
everyone could work with dedication and enjoy the fruits of the criminal
<BR>
enterprise with a clear conscience.  Then of course their were those who
<BR>
lacked talent or training in either thieving or lying.  They had to make do
<BR>
with enjoying the overall high standard of living provided by the thieving
<BR>
of others and, working their butts off, chisling on their taxes(just
<BR>
another kind of theft after all--both the chisling and the taxes),
<BR>
complaining bitterly about being trickle-ees rather than trickle-ers, and
<BR>
all the while declaiming vehemently their honesty and righteousness.         
<BR>
<P>&quot;What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world! the paragon of animals!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Actually, people rich and poor are mostly quite decent.  I like artists and
<BR>
farmers and carpenters and computer geeks (though these last could do with
<BR>
improved social skills and better taste in clothes :-) ).  
<BR>
<P>If you make art, people will reward you for it, more in proportion to your
<BR>
skill as a businessperson than as an artist, and almost certainly not as
<BR>
much as you think you deserve, since we're all inclined to be a bit greedy.
<BR>
<P>Thieves are people, too.
<BR>
<P>Liars though, they really piss me off.
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
