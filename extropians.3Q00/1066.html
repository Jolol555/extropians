<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The first question I would raise is really the most significant: what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it about information that certain people believe makes it different from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other commodities?  We can agree that information is currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incredibly valuable and people are willing to pay billions of dollars
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for it in its various incarnations.  The entertainment industry is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prime example and represents a booming economy.  The only reason we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should deflate that economy is if there is some good reason why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information should no longer command a material value.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, we don't agree here at all.  Information has no inherent value at
<BR>
all.  Bits are just bits.  Value is created by the act of people /wanting/
<BR>
the information, in a certain form at a certain time for their specific
<BR>
purposes.  It is not the labor of creation that makes value, either in
<BR>
material goods or information: that was Marx's flawed premise.  All the
<BR>
labor in the world is worthless unless it produces something someone else
<BR>
/wants/ to have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So what makes it different?   Well, for one thing, it's easy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; steal.  Or rather, it's easy to copy, to transmit, and to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manipulate.  It is very fluid.  Is it's fluidity a good reason
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to seperate it out from the other things on which we place value?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that's not the difference at all.  The essential difference is
<BR>
that freely-copied instances of the same piece of information can
<BR>
be used to serve two people's goals simulatanously.  This is not
<BR>
true of even the cheapest, most fluid physical commodity.  The air
<BR>
I breathe cannot simultaneously be breathed by you.  Nor the water
<BR>
I drink, the money I spend, the space I occupy.  Some allocation
<BR>
strategy is necessary to determine who uses these things.  For some
<BR>
things, &quot;property&quot; is that method.  For things like air, it isn't
<BR>
necessary (though it might be in different conditions, like on a
<BR>
moon base).  But information is fundamentally different: it's not
<BR>
just that copying is cheap, it's that copying actually does double
<BR>
the utility (not value--utility, though utility may lead to value)
<BR>
because my use of the information does not in any way interfere
<BR>
with your use of the information (of course it does interfere with
<BR>
your attempt to treat it as property, but whether or not that's a
<BR>
legitimate thing to do is the issue here). 
<BR>
<P>The rest of this argument proceeds from your flawed assumption, so
<BR>
I won't address it more specifically.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;The most obvious: live performance.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hang on a sec... isn't a live performance just another form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information?  You don't walk away with any material goods... no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property, no energy.  You've just received a bunch of sensory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data.  You're saying that the CD representation of the data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be free, but getting into a concert shouldn't.  Why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Because it's harder to sneak into a concert than to copy a CD?
</EM><BR>
<P>(1) No, a performance is not &quot;information&quot;, it's a unique event
<BR>
in time, and as such, cannot be duplicated.  It's value (and
<BR>
remember, value is created by comsumers, not producers) might be
<BR>
in some small way the information presented, but it is also in
<BR>
the sensual experience, the gathering of friends, the building
<BR>
of memories, &quot;hipness&quot;, and many other things.
<BR>
<P>(2) CDs most definitely should /not/ be free and I never said
<BR>
anything of the kind.  What I'm saying is that Metallica should
<BR>
be able to sell CDs of their music, and I should be able to buy
<BR>
one, press my own CDs of their music, and sell them too.  It is
<BR>
the music itself that shouldn't be ownable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, what you're -really- rewarding here is fame.  You're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selling 'see me in person-ness.'  As someone wise once said:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Making a career on getting famous is like making a career on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; winning the lottery.&quot;  There are hundreds of thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working actors on this planet and, at any one point in time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approximately 100 stars.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly.  This method works best for the famous--the less
<BR>
famous will have to use other methods, or find ways to make
<BR>
themselves famous enough to fill concert halls (like using
<BR>
the net to distribute their music).  The not-so-famous may
<BR>
have to use other methods as well, and actors generall use
<BR>
work-for-hire (but that's off topic here).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is an indirect income stream.  This is money that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can (possibly) make as a side effect of doing a particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing.  The feedback loop is not direct-- you won't make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money on making popular music, just in being able to get big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crowds.  Spectacle bands would become quite popular I imagine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And hey, why bother even playing your *own* music.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you can fill stadiums playing someone else's music, you
<BR>
deserve the money.  Somehow, I suspect authenticity will be
<BR>
a selling point.  Otherwise, why did Milli Vanilli drop out
<BR>
of existence when it was revealed they weren't singing?  The
<BR>
music didn't change any.  Well, their value wasn't just in
<BR>
the music, was it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hmm... okay, so I write a movie soundtrack.  You're making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a movie, so you pay me lots of money for my music.  Wait a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minute--how are *you* going to make money off my music, if I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couldn't?  Ah, okay, you're going to sell it in a different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; format... in -movie format.-  But that's just another type of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.  Are you saying that music should be free, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movies shouldn't?  I didn't think so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Popular movies make millions of dollars on ticket sales in
<BR>
theaters, which are basically live performances (copying
<BR>
among the theaters themselves can be managed by contract).
<BR>
Then, they make millions more with merchandising.  Finally,
<BR>
they make more millions with copyright--by licensing to
<BR>
TV and video rentals.  This last revenue stream will be
<BR>
bitten into without copyright, but the first two won't.  I
<BR>
won't be weeping for Paramount if Star Trek XXI makes only
<BR>
$100 million instead of $200 million.  Jon Williams will
<BR>
still have been paid up front.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ah, okay, now here we go... something *real.*  Make music,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become famous, sell t-shirts.  This is not only indirect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income, it's 2nd order indirect income.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That is to say, you can't just make music and sell t-shirts--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have to become famous as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't have to be very famous at all to make a living.
<BR>
Even a fan base as small as 50-100,000 (small potatoes for
<BR>
any group with an Internet presence) should be able to earn
<BR>
a decent living on merchandise if it's sufficiently &quot;hip&quot;
<BR>
to generate demand, and if the music is good enough to
<BR>
maintain the fan base.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Certain movies just wouldn't get made-- because the criteria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for making them would be different.  The production will follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the reward: if I make money if people come to see my movie, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I make movies people want to come and see.  If I make money by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selling kids plastic dinosaurs, then I make movies that sell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kids plastic dinosaurs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  And your point is?  If what people /want/ is to go to the
<BR>
theater and see a good movie, that's what they'll pay for (and I
<BR>
for one quite enjoy that, and don't blink for moment at shelling
<BR>
out $8 for the prospect).  If people want plastic dinosaurs, then
<BR>
that's what they'll pay for.  What's the problem?  If a movie
<BR>
with no merchandising prospects can't cover its production costs
<BR>
on ticket sales alone, then I don't see any reason why it /should/
<BR>
be made.
<BR>
<P>Take, for example, &quot;Titanic&quot;--the most expensive production of
<BR>
all time.  The story was about two kids, so they couldn't use
<BR>
big stars.  Everyone knows how it ends, so there's no surprize,
<BR>
and no possibility of a sequel.  They destroy the set.  There's
<BR>
little prospect of merchandising.  Yet it got funded, and it made
<BR>
back millions more than its production costs on initial-run ticket
<BR>
sales alone, for which copyright is of no use.  Yes, the millions
<BR>
more it is making now on licensing would be cut into without
<BR>
copyright, but I don't think that's a problem for getting movies
<BR>
made.  Clearly, a good movie that people go to see makes money.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All this is the long way around the barn to say that -no one-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is going to get into the music business because they think it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a better way to sell t-shirts.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where there is demand, people will fill it.  If selling T-shirts
<BR>
is what you have to do to be able to afford the luxury of making
<BR>
music, then that's what you have to do.  I have no sympathy at
<BR>
all for art snobs who think it's demeaning to earn a living.
<BR>
Let 'em starve for their &quot;integrity&quot; if they want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Secondly, saying you can sell music for a short period of time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not a good way to argue that we don't need to sell music
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anymore.  Why just be able to sell for one day?
</EM><BR>
<P>Please pay attention to the argument.  I never said, and never
<BR>
will say, that I don't think people should sell music, or books,
<BR>
or other works now traditionally covered by copyright.  What
<BR>
I'm saying is that we should eliminate the one-track mindset
<BR>
that this is the /only/ way to make money from them, and that
<BR>
copyright is necessary to protect the market for them.  Neither
<BR>
of those things is true: there are lots of other ways to make
<BR>
money, and you can still sell books and records without copyright
<BR>
(which is manifestly true from the simple observation that
<BR>
people still make money selling Shakespeare and Mozart).  This
<BR>
is an entirely consistent point of view.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Adaptation:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not a way to make money.
</EM><BR>
<P>True: it's a way to reduce production costs, after which you
<BR>
need to use the other methods to make money.  I include it
<BR>
here as just another way to debunk the &quot;ending copyright will
<BR>
cause artists to starve&quot; nonsense by pointing out that there
<BR>
are /benefits/ to the artist as well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Convenience: Even when information is cheap, finding it is not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a very good idea about how to make money, and likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a persistent future paradigm.  Again, unfortunately, it's a 2nd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; order reward scheme-- the money is going to go to the person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who makes the information easiest to find and there's no good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason to believe that the artist is going to be the best at\
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing this!  What value does 'authorization' have in this context?
</EM><BR>
<P>That's true, but that's also the way it is now: most of the
<BR>
rewards of copyright, /by far/, go not to the artist, but to the
<BR>
company that makes the artist popular by controlling marketing
<BR>
and distribution.  One should not overlook that the primary
<BR>
economic input of a &quot;publisher&quot; even today is /selection/.  The
<BR>
publisher chooses what to print and distrubute and advertise,
<BR>
and that affects demand and sales.  This will probably still be
<BR>
the case without copyright, only their revenue sources will
<BR>
change a bit, and will depend on artist authorization /more/,
<BR>
because they won't be able to collect as much from past works.
<BR>
They'll have to work harder to be hip and timely and selective.
<BR>
<P>This, by the way, is another way to make &quot;work-for-hire&quot; more
<BR>
profitable.  A publisher, for example, might become the famous
<BR>
entity rather than individual artists (Motown records, for
<BR>
example, got pretty close to this in the 60s).  If consumers
<BR>
come to trust and value a certain publisher, that publisher can
<BR>
do things like make advance sales on albums with unspecified
<BR>
artists, who are them paid on a work-for-hire basis (and whose
<BR>
works are protected from the publisher by NDA rather than
<BR>
copyright).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If [voluntary contribution] was a good way to make money,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public television stations would be rich.  And they'd have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good content.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't like the method either, but it's a living.  PBS
<BR>
does stay in business, and there is the occasional Red Dwarf
<BR>
to balance out all the crap.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, again, for every Michael Jackson, there's hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of struggling, working musicians.
</EM><BR>
<P>Those who absolutely cannot make a living by /any/ of the
<BR>
methods here or others I haven't thought of would really be
<BR>
doing better for themselves and us by earning a living in
<BR>
some other way.  Doing what you want is a luxury--just
<BR>
because someone wants to be a musician doesn't mean I should
<BR>
pass laws to help him.  The people who make music I /want/
<BR>
will get my money, and they'll survive.  The rest might not,
<BR>
but then they don't deserve to.  Though, but that's life.
<BR>
Should we pass laws to make sure I can make a living playing
<BR>
poker, just because that's what I enjoy doing?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Exactly.  And currently we want, and will pay for, music.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The demand is there.  Why, oh why, would we want to destroy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this market?  It makes billions of dollars, employs lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people and is working quite fine thank you very much.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't want to destroy the market--I want to fundamentally
<BR>
change it in a way that will probably put some of them out
<BR>
of work, and employ 10 times as many in the new economy of
<BR>
unrestricted information.  Demand is there, and will always
<BR>
be met, so there will always be people making music and
<BR>
people willing to pay for getting music they like.  The
<BR>
industry will never go away.  It will just change the way
<BR>
it does business, and eliminating the last shackle on the
<BR>
free exchange and use of information will unleash a flood
<BR>
of new industries and opportunities that have never existed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Mr. Crocker realizes this, and thus this posting-- an attempt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find alternate ways in which music can continue to make money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My question is, why are we looking for alternate ways?  What huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; untold advantage is there to removing copyright on music?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am advocating the removal of copyright, period.  On everything.
<BR>
Absolute, 100% free flow of information everywhere with no
<BR>
restrictions.  I want every book and article ever written to be
<BR>
on the net, searchable and cross-linked to every other.  I want
<BR>
artists to be able to freely create a culture from everything
<BR>
they can find--a movie maker should be able to use that old
<BR>
song he likes, even if it's author is jerk.  I want to see X-Rated
<BR>
Mickey Mouse cartoons without Michael Eisner getting in the way.
<BR>
I want rappers and others to sample and remix and modify old
<BR>
tunes in new ways for new audiences.  I want schools across the
<BR>
country to pay $5 for textbooks instead of $50, or to print them
<BR>
from freely-downloaded PDFs.  I want a there to be translations,
<BR>
adaptations, abridgements, parodies, unauthorized sequels, and
<BR>
other derivative works of all the others, regardless of what the
<BR>
originators want or would do themselves.  I want the scriptures
<BR>
of Scientology published for ridicule without getting sued.  I
<BR>
want all this freely flowing information to inspire more artists,
<BR>
inventors, teachers, and businesses to do things they might not
<BR>
have imagined in a world with copyright restrictions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Frankly, if I write a book, I don't want anyone else saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they wrote the damn thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Neither do I; see my other message on this thread about the
<BR>
confusion among copyright, trademarks, and fraud.  I totally
<BR>
support both trademarks and criminalization of fraud.
