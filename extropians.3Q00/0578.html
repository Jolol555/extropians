<EM>&gt; &gt; And really, as a businessman I am busy. Maybe I should take care more of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; store than with a quite technocratic movement that discusses bizarre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So please explain to me why I should keep on being a transhumanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you are looking for short term, &quot;what do I do to change my life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*right now*&quot; type of answers, you might not find them here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Transhumanism will not be achieved overnight.
</EM><BR>
<P>I might cut down on fat food. I might read some articles broadening my mind. 
<BR>
I might perhaps take a look on those concentration techniques. I might 
<BR>
understand that perhaps that banning on cloning isn't such a groovy thing 
<BR>
after all... (that's what it can do just thinking a few seconds)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However, there are always points in your life where you can make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long-term decisions.  For instance, you are a businessman taking care of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a store.  What products do you sell?  If you are interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;promoting the vision discussed here, perhaps you could add some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;types of products discussed here to your wares.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my business, clothes retail and import globalization has been an extremly 
<BR>
important factor. With transhumanism in can better understand the 
<BR>
connections behind that complex process, even what it means for MY company, 
<BR>
and if this process will continue and even develope. I can perhaps start to 
<BR>
analyse future trends in fashion, given this given that. And let us not talk 
<BR>
about nanotechnology that completely eliminates most of the retail chain- 
<BR>
and makes me an information worker too. Gee, talk about new opportunities...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For instance: if you sell computer goods, perhaps you could add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Xybernaut's stuff to your lineup, to introduce more people to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concept.  Ask here for ideas on the uses of augmented reality, so you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can answer your customers when they ask why they would want to buy this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gear.  (And, en route, make money for yourself: the relative scarcity of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people selling these goods may give you a near-monopoly, at least in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;short term, for local supply.  Your market has been created by legions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of science fiction writers and others...but not that many have yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought to actually serve it.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, if I was in that business- but already the minor changes that I 
<BR>
suggested above for my business will have a lot of impact, and it's a 
<BR>
distinct advantage to be a step ahead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Mining for ideas is perhaps the best way you can take advantage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<P>And creating those ideas, which means creating the future. But I cannot do 
<BR>
that if transhumanism is incoherent, then I cannot see the practical 
<BR>
implications of principles, neither can I understand their morality.
<BR>
<P>Whether you are one yourself depends on your personal
<BR>
<EM>&gt;point of view - but there is a difference between being part of a group,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and getting benefit out of using what the group supplies freely.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, this sounds a lot more practical and sensible than &quot;leave the 
<BR>
movement&quot;;-)
<BR>
<P>Ciao
<BR>
Waldemar
