<EM>&gt;Advocates of a government-mediated &quot;social safety net&quot; look at

<P>An interesting post, but I think divergent views might stem from more
<BR>
complicated origins than the dichotomy Greg proposes. Again, I can't speak
<BR>
from a US perspective (despite having glutted myself on Heinlein etc in my
<BR>
time). I can say that my sense of how most people view this issue in Oz is
<BR>
as something often best handled on a user-pays-if-possible basis, but often
<BR>
with fees *graduated*, in the interests of a sort of Kantian fairness.
<BR>
Maybe it comes of an early (white) history here of almost entirely
<BR>
unpredictable wins and losses. The landscape was absurdly inhospitable to
<BR>
agriculture and herding, and everything catches fire and burns to the
<BR>
ground rather a lot. Gold was found in quantities that disrupted the entire
<BR>
nation for some years, making daily life a lottery (and we still gamble to
<BR>
an insane degree). So people learned to depend on each other a great deal,
<BR>
to see each other as `mates' - not rivals. This developed in an atmosphere
<BR>
of distrust of and dislike for authorities, understandably given convict
<BR>
origins (although most settlers were *not* convicts and were quick to deny
<BR>
`the stain'). 
<BR>
<P>I think the outcome of this history was to bias us toward practical
<BR>
solutions that involved *those who happen to have*, today, chipping in for
<BR>
*those who happen to be down on their luck*, in good evolutionary altruist
<BR>
fashion. 
<BR>
<P>How was this to be arranged in a very large and mostly empty nation? You
<BR>
couldn't just depend on your physical neighbor, who might be many miles
<BR>
away but likely to be caught in the same local trap. The general notion
<BR>
that we were all in the same fix, and should share the benefits around,
<BR>
came naturally.
<BR>
<P>In practice, this means that the well-off (having a margin of surplus) are
<BR>
deemed to have a duty to put a larger proportion into the pot. On the other
<BR>
hand, inmany respects egalitarianism gives way to simplicity (and, I
<BR>
suppose, self-respect): everyone except the elderly and infirm pays the
<BR>
same for train or tram or bus fare, and a loaf of bread and litre of milk,
<BR>
and litre of petrol. And since many medicines are centrally subsidised, the
<BR>
rich also get their prescriptions filled for $20 or thereabouts, as do the
<BR>
less well-off. Taxes are graduated, with a maximum of 30% up to incomes of
<BR>
$50K a year, although rising to 47% for the wealthier (but I doubt anyone
<BR>
with a tax accountant pays that). This blend of everyone paying the same
<BR>
for many services and consumables, and the better-off paying a lot more for
<BR>
taxes, is accepted, by and large, as a reasonable compromise. 
<BR>
<P>Nobody ever suggests that everyone in the country should pay the same
<BR>
dollar amount in tax - `$10,000 per person, rich or poor' - nor could that
<BR>
work without abolishing many benefits that are accepted as worth having. I
<BR>
suppose this is not greatly different from the way things have panned out
<BR>
in the States, except for our somewhat more mutually dependant early
<BR>
Zeitgeist.
<BR>
<P>I don't know if this helps the discussion or will be dismissed as more blah
<BR>
blah blah, which maybe it is.
<BR>
<P>Greg sez: &lt;People aren't trained very well in the exercise of freedom and
<BR>
self-responsibility &gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I don't propose any solution for this problem here.  I just think this is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crucial factor in the debate that isn't addressed adequately by either side.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure that's right, but again, there are different and perhaps arguably
<BR>
no less viable ways of doing things that *don't* require that the poor with
<BR>
very few reserves for insurance (charged equally for all, I assume) are
<BR>
left without any access to routine support - the kind of situation
<BR>
prevalent during the Depression, before many of today's ameliorative
<BR>
measures were introduced.
<BR>
<P>But this is all terribly close to the no-no of `debating the basics', so I
<BR>
probably won't continue with it.
<BR>
<P>&lt; sighs of relief from the assembled company &gt;
