Here are two responses to listers' comments that I passed along to Steve,
<BR>
an e-publisher at Fictionwise. Please note: what follows is not ME writing,
<BR>
this is A PUBLISHER in the States. Any responses to this should maybe cc.

<P>=================
<BR>
All three formats we sell (Palm Doc, Acrobat, and Rocket) have a search
<BR>
feature built-in, so there is no need to convert to another format to do a
<BR>
search for a word or phrase. Authors and their agents get antsy if you let
<BR>
people manipulate the files, so we don't explicitly allow that.
<BR>
<P>[...]
<BR>
<P>I am the first to admit that ebook pricing is a complex issue. You are
<BR>
correct that there are other considerations that reduce production costs.
<BR>
However, there are also other factors that increase costs. For example,
<BR>
print books typically pay authors about 7 to 10 percent royalty, while
<BR>
ebooks typically pay more. At Fictionwise we typically pay 30% royalty to
<BR>
an author, triple a typical print publication rate. Our advances also
<BR>
somewhat  exceed typical reprint advance rates.
<BR>
<P>It is necessary to pay authors a higher percentage because many are wary of
<BR>
publishing in ebook format.  In any case, there is some logic that part of
<BR>
the savings should go to the consumer, and part of the savings should
<BR>
go to the authors, who, as Damien will no doubt attest, find it hard enough
<BR>
as it is to make a living from their unique skills.
<BR>
<P>I will also note that we do not charge anything for &quot;shipping,&quot; so that
<BR>
part of your equation is indeed also passed onto consumers. In the case of
<BR>
Eidolon magazine being shipped to other countries, this is a significant
<BR>
cost reduction that is directly passed on, allowing people to sample this
<BR>
magazine for far less than they could
<BR>
otherwise obtain it in the USA and other countries far from Australia. 
<BR>
<P>As for advertising costing less, you are incorrect on that point.
<BR>
Advertising costs just the same for ebooks as it does for any other
<BR>
venture. In fact, because most ebook ventures are new, they must actually
<BR>
advertise *more* than established print publications.
<BR>
<P>So, these things are quite complex, but I stand by my assertion that the
<BR>
retail price of an ebook should be something like 10% less than an
<BR>
equivalent soft cover publication for fictional works, with additional
<BR>
savings going mostly to the author and perhaps a bit for the publisher as
<BR>
well.
