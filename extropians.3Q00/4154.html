<EM>&gt; &gt;A significant minority of those who took part in the survey - more than one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in five - felt that reproductive cloning could also be justified on medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;grounds, if for instance it was the only way for a couple to have a child of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;their own.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would the couple really have their own child? ...only one of the couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would reproduce, that is, have their own clone. Why bother with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'coupledoom' at all?
</EM><BR>
<P>This is already a common practice in fertility medicine.  Where one
<BR>
partner is unable to contribute genetic material, a donor is used so that
<BR>
at least the other partner is biologically the parent.  Couples in such
<BR>
dire straits seem to be happy with this solution, over the alternatives.
<BR>
<P>Cloning might be preferable in that it does not bring in any third party's
<BR>
genes.  I suspect that most couples struggling with infertility would
<BR>
want the chance to raise a child which was a clone of one of the parents.
<BR>
Even the one who is not contributing biologically loves their partner
<BR>
and so would expect to love the child even more.
