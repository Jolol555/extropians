&nbsp;&nbsp;Below this report from Dr Gabe Mirkin is the abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the study Mirkin cites on the possibility of a link
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;between Alzheimer's disease and zinc, which is followed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by the abstract of a recent study (2000) on this topic:

<P>ZINC CAUSES ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE?
<BR>
<P>Report #6325 9/6/94
<BR>
<P>More than 20 years ago, scientists reported a link between
<BR>
aluminum and Alzheimer's disease, a condition that causes
<BR>
senility. Now, most serious scientists do not consider
<BR>
aluminum a factor, but a recent report in the journal,
<BR>
Science, shows that another mineral, zinc, may be associated
<BR>
with that disease.
<BR>
<P>Scientists have known for years that an abnormal protein
<BR>
called beta amyloid accumulates in the brains of people with
<BR>
Alzheimer's disease. Previously, scientists thought that it
<BR>
takes years for beta amyloid to form, but Dr. Rudolph Tanzi
<BR>
of the Massachusetts General Hospital was able to form beta
<BR>
amyloid a couple of minutes after adding high doses of zinc
<BR>
to brain tissue. Brain tissue normally contains very small
<BR>
amounts of zinc.
<BR>
<P>You certainly should not try to avoid foods that are rich
<BR>
sources of zinc, such as meat, liver, eggs, and seafood.
<BR>
Lack of zinc can cause loss of taste and smell, decreased
<BR>
ability to fight infections and loss of memory. However, it
<BR>
may be prudent to avoid zinc pills. In 1991, a study from
<BR>
the University of Melbourne in Australia was discontinued
<BR>
after only two days because giving zinc supplements to
<BR>
subjects with Alzheimer's disease caused a rapid
<BR>
deterioration of their mental abilities. In 1980, another
<BR>
study showed that taking large doses of zinc lower blood
<BR>
levels of the good HDL cholesterol that prevents heart attacks.
<BR>
<P>I'm Dr. Gabe Mirkin on Fitness.

<BR>
<P>Rapid induction of Alzheimer A beta amyloid formation by zinc.

<BR>
<P>A beta 1-40, a major component of Alzheimer's disease cerebral
<BR>
amyloid, is present in the cerebrospinal fluid and remains
<BR>
relatively soluble at high concentrations (less than or equal
<BR>
to 3.7 mM). Thus, physiological factors which induce A beta
<BR>
amyloid formation could provide clues to the pathogenesis of
<BR>
the disease. It has been shown that human A beta specifically
<BR>
and saturably binds zinc. Here, concentrations of zinc above
<BR>
300 nM rapidly destabilized human A beta 1-40 solutions,
<BR>
inducing tinctorial amyloid formation. However, rat A beta
<BR>
1-40 binds zinc less avidly and is immune to these effects,
<BR>
perhaps explaining the scarcity with which these animals form
<BR>
cerebral A beta amyloid. These data suggest a role for cerebral
<BR>
zinc metabolism in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

<BR>
<P>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid deposits
<BR>
within the neocortical parenchyma and the cerebrovasculature.
<BR>
The main component of these predominantly extracellular
<BR>
collections, Abeta, which is normally a soluble component of
<BR>
all biological fluids, is cleaved out of a ubiquitously
<BR>
expressed parent protein, the amyloid protein precursor (APP),
<BR>
one of the type 1 integral membrane glycoproteins. Considerable
<BR>
evidence has indicated that there is zinc dyshomeostasis and
<BR>
abnormal cellular zinc mobilization in AD. We have characterized
<BR>
both APP and Abeta as copper/zinc metalloproteins. Zinc, copper
<BR>
and iron have recently been reported to be concentrated to 0.5
<BR>
to 1 mmol/L in amyloid plaque. In vitro, rapid Abeta aggregation
<BR>
is mediated by Zn(II), promoted by the alpha-helical structure
<BR>
of Abeta, and is reversible with chelation. In addition, Abeta
<BR>
produces hydrogen peroxide in a Cu(II)/Fe(III)-dependent manner,
<BR>
and the hydrogen peroxide formation is quenched by Zn(II).
<BR>
Moreover, zinc preserves the nontoxic properties of Abeta.
<BR>
Although the zinc-binding proteins apolipoprotein E epsilon4
<BR>
allele and alpha(2)-macroglobulin have been characterized as
<BR>
two genetic risk factors for AD, zinc exposure as a risk factor
<BR>
for AD has not been rigorously studied. Based on our findings,
<BR>
we envisage that zinc may serve twin roles by both initiating
<BR>
amyloid deposition and then being involved in mechanisms
<BR>
attempting to quench oxidative stress and neurotoxicity derived
<BR>
from the amyloid mass. Hence, it remains debatable whether zinc
<BR>
supplementation is beneficial or deleterious for AD until
<BR>
additional studies clarify the issue.
