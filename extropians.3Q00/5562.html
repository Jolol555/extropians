<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; You cannot win a negotiation against something that quite rightly views
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as a deterministic process.
</EM><BR>
<P>Woah, woah, woah, hang on a second here!  That's a big word to be throwing
<BR>
around with regards to the human computer!  A deterministic process?  We're
<BR>
far enough up the sentience ladder that I think the answers on that are
<BR>
still up for grabs.
<BR>
<P>In fact, you are talking about the most complex, emergent, self-organizing
<BR>
adaptive system of which we are currently cognizant in the known universe--
<BR>
human intelligence.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I believe Eliezer is alluding to the the difficulty of identifying with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind that is that much closer to a force_of_nature then any mere
</EM><BR>
unaugmented
<BR>
<EM>&gt; human ever can or ever will be.
</EM><BR>
<P>-We- are a force of nature.  We are nature emergent.  We are the result of
<BR>
the self organization of matter in the universe.  We are nature looking at
<BR>
itself.
<BR>
<P>This is the truth.
<BR>
<P>...And I have little doubt that higher intelligences -can- exist and they
<BR>
will be mighty, and they may look upon us as bugs-- but I simply don't buy
<BR>
that intelligence is a boring linear progression-- I simply don't buy that
<BR>
AI will fail to look back at us and find us fascinating.  We're -not- as
<BR>
unto bugs-- we represent a tremendously significant turning point in the
<BR>
pattern of existence.  Frankly, failing to be interested in us is not a sign
<BR>
of intelligence.
<BR>
<P>Hang on a second, I'm drifting dangerously.  But I'm passionate about this,
<BR>
damnit!   :)
<BR>
<P>The point is simply that right now we are the best example of intelligence
<BR>
around.  In fact, we define the term.  And we know for certain that true AI
<BR>
will share one thing with us: intelligence.  Otherwise we'd call them
<BR>
something else.
<BR>
<P>We'll also share this:  reality built us.
<BR>
<P>Hmm... it seems I may be coming around to Eliezer's model of thinking on a
<BR>
particular level, while still strangely in disagreement:  I think it is
<BR>
likely that while we may not understand particular actions or thought
<BR>
processes that AIs will have, we -will- be able to appreciate the reasons
<BR>
for them.  The supergoals.  We can grok &quot;I take these particular actions to
<BR>
achieve a goal.&quot;  We can grok: &quot;I will act to maximize my survivability.&quot;
<BR>
We can grok: &quot;Take in information, make a decision based on that
<BR>
information,&quot; all processes that are integral to intelligence.  (Or again:
<BR>
otherwise we should use another word to describe it.)
<BR>
<P>-These- commonalties are the interface by which we will connect with AI.
<BR>
They will interface with us via our intelligence.  I don't think they will
<BR>
be totally alien to us-- on the contrary, I think we'll find them eerily
<BR>
familiar, though continua of intelligence divide us.  Like an old friend.
<BR>
Like something that was always there, under the surface.  And they will
<BR>
understand us better than we understand ourselves.  And, who knows, this
<BR>
might make them care about us deeply.  Best case scenario!  (Frail, clever
<BR>
little humans!)
