<P>70s games?  They were still like that in the early 80s too, as far as
<BR>
we knew of.  Did you guys ever play mansion?  There were plenty
<BR>
of others like it.  The various dungeons and dragons games, thats
<BR>
what we thought computers were for.  {8^D

<P><EM>&gt;  I wonder if there are two types of people -- those

<EM>&gt; who can create mental images reflecting a reality and those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; require the images to be painted for them...

<P>Ja I never got into the graphics games as much really.  The
<BR>
text based games, a lot of them had some really cool
<BR>
unstated sexual undercurrent that I dont thing translated
<BR>
well into graphics.
<BR>
<P>For instance, in mansion there was a narrow passage thru which
<BR>
one needed to pass, but could not unless one dropped ones clothes.
<BR>
Thereafter, it was not at all straightforward how to get back to
<BR>
retrieve the clothing, so one was nekkid until one could find
<BR>
the star trek transporter.  Wherever one went in the mansion,
<BR>
people would laugh at you.  The butler, the maid, the dog,
<BR>
everybody.  {8^D  It was a hoot.  spike
