<P>
Po: no paradigm-breaching magic physics await discovery, only deeper tweaks
<BR>
and compressions to what we already know; no wormhole or
<BR>
information-carrying non-local connectivity or other superluminal
<BR>
information transfers.
<BR>
<P>If that's the universe we inhabit, what's the ultimate foreseeable
<BR>
transport system?
<BR>
<P>I have a sense of such a process, but in my ignorance I don't know if it's
<BR>
anything more than wishful thinking. After brooding on this idea for a
<BR>
time, I came up with the subject line idea, then remembered that Rudy
<BR>
Rucker dealt with just this approach in his odd, idea-crammed  pop sci
<BR>
`novel' SAUCER WISDOM (Tor, 1999).
<BR>
<P>Ideally, you want to be able to reduce a mindful system to a code string
<BR>
and broadcast or beamcast it into space at or near lightspeed. (Only *near*
<BR>
c if you need to use modulated nearly-massless neutrinos, say.) This
<BR>
conveys you as far as possible as swiftly as possible.
<BR>
<P>Trouble is, like DNA or computer code, such messages need to be decoded,
<BR>
instantiated and run before they have any effect (and presumably before
<BR>
they can be conscious and active). DNA needs a ribosome and a bunch of
<BR>
enzymes inside the context of a metabolizing cell. Programs needs dedicated
<BR>
hardware. AI or encrypted organic mind/bodies can get from here to there in
<BR>
one of two main ways:
<BR>
<P>1)	Fire ahead a stream of, say, very fast low-mass nano von Neumann devices
<BR>
with redundant minimal information, able to build assemblers once they find
<BR>
a source of convenient construction materials and abundant energy, which
<BR>
deploy a receiver able to instantiate the signal that's being sent in their
<BR>
direction. Or
<BR>
<P>2)	Develop a self-extracting signal able to interface with some plentiful
<BR>
natural condition - 
<BR>
<P>(here a miracle of insight into nature's workings occurs) 
<BR>
<P>- and modify that state of matter and energy into a device able to unpack
<BR>
the signal's main message.
<BR>
<P>Rucker proposes (playfully but I assume seriously), `You have to make a
<BR>
signal that's self-extracting, and you have to master femtotechnology to
<BR>
extract out into a physical form' (p. 119). You start with a zettabyte of
<BR>
coded  transhuman that's first squeezed by crypto to an exabyte: the same
<BR>
order of magnitude, interestingly, proposed by Greg Egan in several fictions.
<BR>
<P>His codes are impressed onto `higher-dimensional waves... like a skater
<BR>
resting on a little line of a blade that carves a clean curve across the
<BR>
ice. The blade-line is the ordinary electromagnetic wave that you see' (pp.
<BR>
115-6).
<BR>
<P>Maybe we can get by without higher-dimensional waves (or branes, whatever),
<BR>
or maybe that's just the kind of world we're in so we use what we can get
<BR>
our hands on. Either way, I don't know how to make that final unzipping
<BR>
occur. Run the code-string into solar plasma vortices? Into a planetary van
<BR>
Allen belt? Into the accretion disk of a black hole? All these have been
<BR>
suggested in fiction as habitats for smart signal resonances. I'm wondering
<BR>
if anyone here can come up with better proposals.
