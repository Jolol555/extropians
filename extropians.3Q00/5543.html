</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;To carry a lethal weapon, as others have pointed out, means adjusting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;your thought processes to the point where you are prepared to exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lethal force.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't see the necessity of that relation.  One might be quite willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carry a lethal weapon and yet be quite unwilling to use it.  By far the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of defensive uses of firearms involve mere brandishing them.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffices to give the impression that you can and will use deadly force.
</EM><BR>
<P>I tend to agree with Michael Lorrey here:  &quot;Any weapon you carry you MUST be
<BR>
willing to use. Visualize using in various circumstances. Determine what are
<BR>
appropriate weapons for you, what you are
<BR>
comfortable with, and under what circumstances.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If you are truly unwilling to use a weapon, but want it simply to scare
<BR>
people away, why not load it with blanks?  You just don't fool around with
<BR>
this kind of sh!t in my opinion.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;impersonal and hard-hearted?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To the contrary, I would argue that a person unwilling to conceive of
</EM><BR>
using
<BR>
<EM>&gt; deadly force in defense of self and loved ones lacks both self-regard and
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; callous attitude toward the very people who most deserve protection.
</EM><BR>
<P>You should read Hal's post again, because this is -not- what he's talking
<BR>
about.  The issue at hand is the repercussions to one's dealings with others
<BR>
upon making the specific decision to carry, and use, deadly force.  This is
<BR>
not a discussion regarding someone's inability to &quot;_conceive_ of using
<BR>
deadly force in defense of self and loves ones&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a father who says, &quot;Oh, my, no!  I would not shoot someone even if it were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the only way to stop them from raping my wife and killing my children!
</EM><BR>
That
<BR>
<EM>&gt; would be so, so . . . cruel!&quot;  I think we would rightly regard that fellow
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; not just a coward but as morally culpable for failing to shoulder his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsibilities.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt such an impulse stems from cowardice, but you'd be right in the
<BR>
assumption that I would find such an individual was critically limited by
<BR>
the rigidity of his moral code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Would he nonetheless seem admirably warm-blooded,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal, and soft-hearted to Hal?
</EM><BR>
<P>Admirably?  It's interesting that upon Hal asking the question: &quot;isn't it
<BR>
possible that this psychological adjustment will be damaging to your
<BR>
relationships with other people?&quot;  (a valid and interesting question in my
<BR>
opinion,) there have been immediate responses seemingly interpreting his
<BR>
question as an attack on people who make this adjustment and a resounding
<BR>
praise in favor of those who don't-- an interpretation that fails to address
<BR>
the central point by virtue of presupposition.
<BR>
<P>Instead, we might think about actually applying some thought to the issue.
<BR>
<P>For those of you who are interested in doing so, let me proffer the
<BR>
following questions:
<BR>
<P>a) As best as we are able to determine, by what margin do you increase your
<BR>
survivability by choosing to train and equip yourself with deadly force?
<BR>
Clearly this number will differ from individual to individual-- but unless
<BR>
we have ninjas or mobsters on this list, I think our relative probabilities
<BR>
will clump fairly closely.
<BR>
<P>b) Choosing to train and equip yourself with deadly force is a powerful
<BR>
decision with moral implications and necessitates the ability to take a
<BR>
particular type of decisive and permanent action, with real repercussions.
<BR>
Are there possible negative side effects to making such a decision?  If so,
<BR>
is it worth it anyway?
<BR>
<P>Several list members have already given the impression that they do not
<BR>
believe that there are possible negative side effects to making such a
<BR>
decision.  (Maybe there are positive ones!)  That's fine, and we know how
<BR>
you stand on the issue.
<BR>
<P>I tend to disagree.  But first a caveat: unlike some list members, I
<BR>
actually don't associate with very many gun owners, let alone people who
<BR>
actively carry firearms.  So much of this is pure conjecture.  However, in
<BR>
my limited dealings with those who have inclinations in that direction
<BR>
(including people on this list,) my impression has been that: as a result of
<BR>
their decision, the means by which they interact with other people has been
<BR>
altered in a fashion that I would consider negative-- in some cases, even so
<BR>
far as to have a direct effect on their survivability, or quality of life.
<BR>
<P>HOWever, in accordance with the complexity of this issue, I suspect that to
<BR>
some degree, and in some cases, the reverse is true.  (Sense of security,
<BR>
personal empowerment, etc.)
<BR>
<P>And even granted that there are negative repercussions, I can imagine
<BR>
scenarios under which &quot;it is worth it anyway,&quot; as I've mentioned in an
<BR>
earlier posting.
<BR>
<P>In any case, at this point in time, it is obvious to me the repercussions of
<BR>
equipping myself with deadly force outweigh the exceedingly slim margin by
<BR>
which it would increase my survivability under current conditions.  I mean,
<BR>
come on people, you genuinely want to increase your survivability, stop
<BR>
driving.
<BR>
<P><P>I invite discussion from those aware of, and interested in, the ambiguity
<BR>
and complexity of this issue.
