Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>This is a very fascinating post from cryonet which was written by prominent cryonicist Paul Wakfer.  In terms of informing us what the current state of cryonics is along with some very interesting past history I would say all should read this.  I greatly respect Paul for his noble Prometheus Project which failed for reasons he gives here.  I am glad my friend is feeling good about life...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Greetings All:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a request for a pointer to a site that summarizes the &gt;current state-of-the-art.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no site where this is all summarized. The information is very
<BR>
scattered, and/or not yet written down. This is mainly the result of the constant infighting which goes on in a fringe group like the world of cryonics, for control of the very small pond in which all these frogs are croaking to each other.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Two or three years ago I found material which put me pretty well up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now where might you have found that? the Prometheus Project (PP)
<BR>
website, perhaps?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I recall the overall status, vitrification was promising and it appeared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crystalization might be prevented during freezing by using a high pressure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chamber.  However it tended to occur during thawing too unless very high thaw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rates were used.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was only an interim step during the research which Greg Fahy was
<BR>
doing to reversibly cryopreserve kidneys. In fact, not only was it
<BR>
always deemed impractical for whole body humans, but he very soon found that the pressure itself induced additional unrecoverable damage, and soon after abandoned the pressure approach.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It was impossible to achieve such rates (and -- was there a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uniformity problem with some regions remaining too cold?) [Is this still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; true?]
</EM><BR>
<P>No. All those ideas have been superseded now. 21st Century Medicine (21CM) has developed ice blockers and new cryoprotectants which enable vitrification at high enough cryoprotectant (CPA) concentrations that recrystallization during thawing should be
<BR>
avoidable at the rate of warming which can be reasonably achieved.
<BR>
<P>All of this has been hastened by the development by Critical Care
<BR>
Research (CCR - a split-off of the original 21CM) of perfluorocarbon
<BR>
perfusion methods which allow very rapid cooling and warming of whole
<BR>
bodies even, right down to the vitrification holding temperatures
<BR>
required.
<BR>
<P>Basically, things are looking exceedingly optimistic that perfected
<BR>
whole body suspended animation could be &quot;just around the corner&quot;, if we could only get these short-sighted, head-in-the-sand, money-hoarding cryonicists to fork over the necessary cash. I hasten to add that my comments do not apply to those few wonderful, courageous, and fully rational people who have monetarily supported all the research to achieve these goals, and, of course, to the researchers themselves.
<BR>
As it is, the work of proving out, completing development, and
<BR>
perfecting the breakthroughs outlined above is ongoing, albeit at a very slow pace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Overall, everything from embryos to aortas could be frozen and thawed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully, but nothing bigger.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even embryos, sperm, and some other things were only viable because they could incur large ce
