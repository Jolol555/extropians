<EM>&gt;We talk about father's rights, but what happens when anyone can take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;microscopic samples from anywhere you've been and either create a clone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or use them to create a baby for which you are the biological parent?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Should this be illegal, that is, should society try to stop people from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing this without the consent of the donor?  (David Zindell in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Neverness series called this crime &quot;slelling&quot;.)  Celebrities could find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves being unwillingly cloned into thousands of babies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And then, there might be cases where consent is difficult to prove.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Two people have sex, and the man has arranged to be sterile, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;woman wants his baby and has easy access to his DNA.  The man's efforts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to control his reproduction could easily be thwarted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These situations remind us that we are fundamentally information beings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It is the nature of information to be copied, which conflicts with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideas about the uniqueness of each individual.  The good thing about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these scenarios is that the babies are wanted, so presumably there will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be loving parents to raise them.

I think the &quot;slelling&quot; issue depends on the level of access to cloning
<BR>
technology.  If you can clone and incubate in the privacy or your own
<BR>
basement (a Clone@Home system perhaps), then it'd be difficult to stop
<BR>
someone intent on using your DNA for their own reproductive ends.
<BR>
<P>However, if it's run by an organisation or govt. institution, they may have
<BR>
a &quot;Consent Register&quot;, so if the DNA someone's provided for
<BR>
reproducing/cloning is not their own, they check it against the register,
<BR>
and see if your name pops up (assuming it's your DNA of course) as having
<BR>
given consent to this person, if at all.  If you haven't, then no dice, and
<BR>
they destroy or retain the DNA and notify you of the attempt.
<BR>
<P>This of course would require a worldwide system, otherwise you could find a
<BR>
half dozen clones of you in Brazil or somewhere :)  Even the Clone@Home
<BR>
system could be designed to only operate when confirmation has been
<BR>
received over a network link of some kind to the Consent Register, or if
<BR>
you've physically given the machine permission through a fingerprint or
<BR>
retinal scan (with appropriate safeguards for severed limbs and gouged
<BR>
eyes*Eeeuuuwww*).
<BR>
<P>Then again, both these systems raise all those ugly central
<BR>
register/privacy issues.  But hey, what doesn't these days?;-&gt;
