<P><EM>&gt;If you define art as stuff that makes people change their minds or forces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them to deal with issues, then there is no way to distinguish art from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-art and the term becomes meaningless.  A death in the family forces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people to deal with issues.  Is it art too?  Being mugged will change lots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of people.  Is mugging an art form?
</EM><BR>
<P>Although I've seen it cited as such, I regard changing people's minds,
<BR>
forcing them to deal with something, or evoking an emotional response as
<BR>
frequent consequences of art, not central to the definition of art.
<BR>
<P>Natasha and Nadia should really weigh in on this one.  The definition of art
<BR>
keeps moving, and it often takes generations for the borders to move.  I know 
<BR>
that my own opinions don't keep up.  The art world says that Jackson Pollack, 
<BR>
Christo, and Karen Finley are artists; I'm not convinced.
<BR>
<P>Eduardo Kac is a self-described performance artist.  His intent was not just
<BR>
to produce the bunny but to interact with it on stage.  So this is probably
<BR>
art by current definitions.
<BR>
<P>I don't think *this* bunny is art by itself but I think that genemods per se
<BR>
can be an art form as much as any other.  Perhaps in the same category as
<BR>
bodybuilding, topiary, perfume, cooking, architecture, and clothing design.
<BR>
Being useful doesn't make an endeavor any less art.  (Or does it?  Must art
<BR>
serve no functional purpose to qualify as art?  I say no.)
<BR>
<P>What new art forms will arise as consequences of anticipated technological 
<BR>
developments?  Besides genemods, I think that personalities could become an 
<BR>
art form.  We already consider acting to be an art form; if you could precisely 
<BR>
sculpt a personality, wouldn't that qualify?
<BR>
<P>Don't forget Heinlein's &quot;The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag&quot;:  SI as 
<BR>
artist, universe as art.  What about creating a religion?
<BR>
<P>My own guess is that any deliberately constructed object or action can be 
<BR>
assessed from an artistic point of view.  Art requires an artist.  So a
<BR>
sunset is aesthetic, but it is not art (unless you bring in the God thing).
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure if art requires that the creator(s) have had the intent to create
<BR>
art per se.  One could certainly make an aesthetic assessment of lying, sex, or 
<BR>
car engines; is an artistic intent required to label it as art?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My ethical point was to question whether such experiments should be done on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conscious beings.  I've not against genetic engineering per se.  This does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not mean, however, anything goes.  I'm not for, and I doubt many on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list are for, kidnapping people and using them genetic experiments.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your question about conscious beings is legitimate.  A key point though is 
<BR>
that we've been genetically modifying conscious beings -- humans, pets, working
<BR>
animals, and farm animals -- for our purposes already, without consent, for 
<BR>
millenia.  Direct genemod is just a more efficient mechanism than selective 
<BR>
breeding.
