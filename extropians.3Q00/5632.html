<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, why bother.  I really am starting to get a bit frustrated over here.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been talking about this for weeks and it doesn't seem to have any effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatsoever.  Nobody is even bothering to distinguish between subgoals and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supergoals.  You're all just playing with words.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey!  Wait a second.  If you are going to be a leader in the greatest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; project in human history (or in any project for that matter) you have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; learn and learn damn fast to be able to motivate and enroll people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; No, actually I should expect that the seed AI project will have smaller total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expenditures, frcom start to finish, than a typical major corporation's Y2K
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; projects.  I used to think in terms of the greatest project in human history,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but I no longer think that'll be necessary, and a damn good thing, as I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think we're gonna *get* the largest budget in human history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huh?  I wasn't using &quot;greatest&quot; in respect to budget or size of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development team (although I think both will be greater than you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think).  I was using it in terms of the criticality of this project. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You continuously tell us it is our only hope.  It is difficult to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine a project much &quot;greater&quot; than that.
</EM><BR>
<P>And what will it accomplish in terms which laymen can understand, the way
<BR>
we understand a computer playing chess better than a human or doing
<BR>
arithmetic better than a human?
