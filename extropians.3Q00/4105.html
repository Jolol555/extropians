Pyramid Operating Systems is the originator's spin-off company:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.pyramidos.com/investor/article3.html">http://www.pyramidos.com/investor/article3.html</A>
<BR>
&quot;In one quantum leap forward, incremental changes of the past in the composites
<BR>
industry are giving way to a total system breakthrough,&quot; says Gene Kirila, CEO
<BR>
of Pyramid Operating Systems. Kirila refers to his firm's new VEC (TM) operating
<BR>
system, the VEC 5.5 Cell. The &quot;Virtual Engineered&quot; composites system links
<BR>
materials, equipment, process control, human interface, and advanced technology
<BR>
in one program. A key component of the operating system is Floating Mold (TM), a
<BR>
patent-pending, closed-mold technique that uses two composite laminate skins in
<BR>
a liquid, air-tight seal of two pressure vessels filled with non-compressible
<BR>
fluid. The system collects and analyzes materials data, then creates complete
<BR>
histograms of the resin environment during the composite-producing process.
<BR>
Control parameters include: temperature, viscosity, flow rate, mass density, gel
<BR>
times, and peak exotherms on a real-time basis.

<P>Nanopowders, rapid compaction spur new metallurgical processes
<BR>
Utron Inc. has developed a combustion gas chamber to quickly compress metallic
<BR>
powders into small parts, and eventually mass-produce small and big components
<BR>
based on the process. It's one of many efforts by powder-metallurgy scientists
<BR>
to take talcum, powder-size grains of metals and turn them into pressed parts.
<BR>
Current methods use pressure and heat to slowly press out small batches of
<BR>
parts. Making large parts in this fashion requires long exposure to heat, with
<BR>
possible undesirable molecular changes resulting. With the combustion gas
<BR>
chamber process, Utron hopes to mass-produce parts &quot;on millisecond time scales,&quot;
<BR>
according to Dr. Arul Mozhie, Utron senior scientist. The Utron process evolved
<BR>
from pulsed power and high-pressure combustion technologies developed for
<BR>
hypervelocity launch and other defense applications. The process uses
<BR>
high-pressure pulses, produced by the controlled combustion of propellants, to
<BR>
consolidate the tiny copper and steel powders Utron made using a higher momentum
<BR>
flux gas medium. The work was pursued under a contract awarded by the Ballistic
<BR>
Missile Defense Organization. FAX (703) 369-5298.

<P>The process of manufacturing fiberglass boats has remained virtually unchanged
<BR>
for 50 years, but Genmar Holdings of Minneapolis has come up with a
<BR>
technological breakthrough that could revolutionize the marine industry, said
<BR>
Jan Teply, the company's Director of Engineering. It is Virtual Engineered
<BR>
Composites (VEC), a new closed-mold fiberglass manufacturing process that works
<BR>
in a highly automated, computer-controlled environment.
<BR>
VEC technology produces perfect boat parts up to four times faster than
<BR>
conventional open mold processes. It produces &quot;a stronger, lighter boat of
<BR>
consistent quality&quot; while exceeding all applicable environmental standards,
<BR>
Teply said. Genmar plans to expand its application to other marine products and
<BR>
license the technology to companies in other industries like construction,
<BR>
transportation and recreation, Teply stated.
