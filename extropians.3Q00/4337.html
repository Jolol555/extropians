Careful.  A limited partner can only become such by way of registration with 
<BR>
a state authority whereas people can and do become general partners quite by 
<BR>
accident, unaware of the legal consequences that can follow from jointly 
<BR>
operating a business.  So the relationship described would, absent the 
<BR>
conscious choice embodied in a filing with a state agency, not qualify as a 
<BR>
limited partnership.  Granted that the parties could choose that 
<BR>
relationship.  They could, for that matter, choose an LLP or LLC or 
<BR>
incorporation or S-corp or so forth.  But that was not the issue; the issue 
<BR>
was whether or not a mere creditor could become a partner.  General partner, 
<BR>
yes.  Limited partner, not without an extra step of filing.

<EM>&gt;  Most locales recognize what you are describing as a &quot;Limited Partner&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  under the law.  A limited partner is essential an investor that owns a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  percentage of a Partnership, but who is not actively involved in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  business and therefore has no liability.  Limited partners who do actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  involve themselves in the business of the partnership are usually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  adjudicated as in fact being General Partners under the law, and can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  therefore be held liable.
