<P>Actually the explanation for the way astronauts broadcast from space
<BR>
is simpler.  They had hands-free radios that would start to broadcast
<BR>
when the voice activated the transmitter, a little like speaker phones
<BR>
do today, only in those days, with slower electronics, the first 200
<BR>
or so milliseconds of transmission would be lost.  So the astronauts
<BR>
would always use a one-off from &quot;duh,&quot; which was &quot;ahhh&quot; as in
<BR>
&quot;ahhhh Houston ahhhhh we have ahhhhh problem...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Legend holds that Armstrong was so overwhelmed when he stood
<BR>
on the moon, he forgot to say ahhhh, which caused the &quot;a&quot; to be
<BR>
lost, so that his comment came out &quot;one small step for...man.&quot;  At
<BR>
least thats what was claimed.  The second half of that sentence was
<BR>
unintelligible at the time, so we all thought he was saying &quot;This is
<BR>
really no big deal, just another small step for man.&quot;  spike
