----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20GUNS:%20Why%20here?&In-Reply-To=&lt;006b01c025aa$f6b810e0$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Statistically many crimes are stopped by an armed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be victim or witness with no shot fired.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, since you brought it up, what are the statistics?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I have not found it to be so in people I know who are armed.  At the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of the threat it is certainly true that you can't take the time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a philosophical debate or a psychological rap session.  Although I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have seen explosively violent situations be defused by this with and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without someone having the force to back up their defense.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little that is more personal and immediate than staring in the face of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; death or injury at the hands of another human being.  At the point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone treats you as an object of their pleasure or as an it or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; target of their rage at the world it is they who are practicing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impersonalization.  Not you in taking the precaution of being able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defend yourself and others.
</EM><BR>
<P>You -don't- think that de-personalization of your foe is common or desirable
<BR>
amongst those who are prepared to use deadly force?  Have you questioned the
<BR>
people you &quot;know who are armed?&quot;  What advantage does the personalization of
<BR>
your foe confer, and why would anyone want to retain this sort of emotional
<BR>
connectivity in these sorts of situations?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers
</EM><BR>
(and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; impersonal and hard-hearted?  Might they not face a burden in setting up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; alliances and working together with other people, compared to those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are more trusting, open and accepting of human limitations and
</EM><BR>
weaknesses?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again.  I have not seen any such thing in people who are armed.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; precisely because they care profoundly that many of them are armed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting however the correlation between &quot;list members who profess to be
<BR>
armed&quot; and &quot;list members who appear a little bit more impersonal.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I am absolutely not judging anyone on the basis of this, but neither am I
<BR>
blind to the data.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Taking the responsibility of carrying a gun is going to change you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It forces you to think of yourself as a killer, as one who is willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to kill.  Admittedly, if you actually save your life by carrying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun then any costs it imposes are worthwhile.  But the chance that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will actually be killed by violence are highly remote.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is assumption piled on assumption.  This categorical statement you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make is utterly unjustified.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which categorical statement?
<BR>
<P>&quot;Taking the responsibility of carrying a gun is going to change you&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Or
<BR>
<P>&quot;The chance you will actually be killed by violence are [sic] highly
<BR>
remote&quot;?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Given the very small probability of this outcome, the costs in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of your alienation from society must be considered significant.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; long run your survival prospects will be hurt by having a lesser degree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of social connectivity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have built a magnificent strawman.
</EM><BR>
<P>Truly magnificent-- it seems remarkably valid to me.
<BR>
