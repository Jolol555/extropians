<BR>
<EM>&gt; MARYSVILLE, Ohio -- Standing in long rows in Greenhouse No. 3 at the Scotts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Co.'s research laboratory are pots of grass that could be a suburbanite's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dream come true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The grass, which Scotts hopes will eventually carpet every lawn and golf
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course around the world, is genetically altered to withstand applications of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the most potent weedkillers and remain healthy and green.
</EM><BR>
<P>We see the problem right here.  Over and over, genetic engineering is
<BR>
being associated with activities which will put more poisons into the
<BR>
environment.
<BR>
<P>Grass that stays green is fine.  Grass which can withstand high doses of
<BR>
weedkillers is not!  People don't want to live in neighborhoods which
<BR>
use extra-high amounts of weedkillers.  They see it as a health hazard
<BR>
and a form of exposure to toxic chemicals.
<BR>
<P>Many of the earlier well-publicized uses of genetic engineering fell
<BR>
into this category.  Roundup-resistant soybeans would allow herbicides
<BR>
to be used on crops where they can't be used now.  Great, this way we
<BR>
can eat more herbicides.  Other changes would cause plants to create
<BR>
their own insecticides.  This way they can't be washed off and so we
<BR>
end up consuming them.
<BR>
<P>The biochemical companies need to pull their heads out of wherever they've
<BR>
stuck them, and start coming up with uses which won't be public releations
<BR>
disasters.  Plants with extra vitamins and nutrients, plants which can
<BR>
aid people in the Third World, these are the kinds of applications people
<BR>
will support.  Finding ways to get more harmful chemicals into food is
<BR>
not a productive course of action.
