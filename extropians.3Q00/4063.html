<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; an external reality.  Not yet anyway.  We do not currently have the

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to perceive reality directly.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What do you mean &quot;we&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Do you have a mouse in your pocket?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah... I see the nature of our disagreement.  You believe that you are able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to perceive reality directly?
</EM><BR>
<P>I meant to answer this yesterday.  I've been basically ignoring this thread
<BR>
for the past several days.
<BR>
<P>Before going on, I'd like to point out that I discuss some of these issues
<BR>
in &quot;A Dialogue on Happiness&quot; at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Dialogue.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Dialogue.html</A> and also in &quot;Perception and
<BR>
Realism&quot; at <A HREF="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Percept.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Percept.html</A>  (The latter is a
<BR>
review of the below mentioned book by Kelley.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, when you look at a pen, you believe that you are directly seeing the
</EM><BR>
pen
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as opposed to photons that have been reflected from its surface?  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand, I hope, that as sensory beings, we must be content with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reception of signals (for now.)  We evolved five ways of sensing our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment-- this is not a complete set and it suffices only to give us a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular picture of reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not place absolute belief in my senses.  I am aware of the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they represent information regarding properties of the object and not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is what is known in philosophy circles as _representationalism_ -- the
<BR>
view that we do not perceive reality directly, but only perceive
<BR>
representations of real objects from which we infer the latter's existence
<BR>
and nature.  There are some flaws in representationalism which David Kelley
<BR>
examines rigorously in his _The Evidence of the Senses: A Realist Theory of
<BR>
Perception_.  I highly recommend that work.
<BR>
<P>What are these flaws?  Well, the grounding assumption behind both
<BR>
representationalism and naive realism (the view that we perceive things
<BR>
without mediation at all, that our senses merely copy what's out there) is
<BR>
that perception to be truthful must be unmediated.  Naive realism assumes
<BR>
the senses are faithful and do not distort external reality.  Along comes
<BR>
illusions (e.g., bent stick in water), relativity of the senses (e.g., walk
<BR>
into an air conditioned room on warm day and it feels even colder than if
<BR>
you do so on a cool day), dreams, and hallucinations and the naive realist
<BR>
is generally converted into the representationalist.  The latter still holds
<BR>
the view that awareness must be invariable and unmediated.  So, she or he
<BR>
retreats.  Now, the senses distort or lie by only representing things in
<BR>
reality to the mind, but the representations themselves are directly
<BR>
perceived.  This only pushes the question further back.  How can one
<BR>
directly be aware of representations?  Couldn't the mind distort them too?
<BR>
<P>Another flaw with representationalism is that once things are pushed back to
<BR>
the representations, there is no need of the external object.  In fact, it
<BR>
one cannot be aware of the external world and can only be aware of images in
<BR>
the mental theater, how can one be sure there is an external world at all?
<BR>
One can't if representationalism is granted as true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let me try a brief example to illustrate why our perception of reality is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily indirect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm going to abstract the model by one level to see if it becomes more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clear:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Let us suppose that I have a bunch of multi-colored tennis balls, that I
</EM><BR>
am
<BR>
<EM>&gt; bouncing up against some object.  And let us further suppose that due to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of this object, only the orange balls are 'springy' enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ricochet over a wall and land in your lap.  Do you think that only
</EM><BR>
receiving
<BR>
<EM>&gt; orange balls from the object is an indication that the object itself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orange?  Or instead an indication of a particular property of the object?
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree with Molloy here.  This is a great example.  I would assume
<BR>
something about the object and the orange balls makes only the latter
<BR>
return.  I.e., I would learn something about the external world from this
<BR>
example.  I might make the wrong judgment -- and, believe me, I've been
<BR>
there, done that, and got many a tee shirt -- but given enough data, I could
<BR>
form the right conclusion.
<BR>
<P>This would be the same if we used a more realistic example.  Say, e.g.,
<BR>
there was a single object in an otherwise black room.  There is also a bank
<BR>
of lights, each of a different color in the room, but between them and the
<BR>
object is a filter glass which I'm unaware of.  It filters out all but
<BR>
orange light.  Now you try all the lights and discover you don't see
<BR>
anything except when the orange light is on.  You might assume the object
<BR>
is, therefore, orange.  However, a better test could be to place another
<BR>
object which you knew not to be orange, perhaps an object that is white, at
<BR>
the same location and see what happens when you run the same test.
<BR>
(Astronomers run into this all the time because the atmosphere, dust clouds,
<BR>
etc. filter and distort light from extraterrestrial sources.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I could go on.  Alien beings may perceive 'reality' in a totally different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion from us.  What you call an orange pen, they may describe in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; radically different terms.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, but this does not invalidate perception -- ours or theirs.  A
<BR>
colorblind person still perceives the same reality as me.  She is missing an
<BR>
aspect of it that I can experience.  Yet given enough information, she can
<BR>
come to see color exists though for her it will never be directly perceived.
<BR>
It will be akin to me using an infrared camera.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;We&quot; (my mouse and I) are simply brains in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; box, sending and receiving signals to and from existence.  When we are
</EM><BR>
able
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to disassociate ourselves from our physical models of the universe, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enable our brains to penetrate deeper into the substrate.  We cling to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tactile conceptualization of reality-- objects 'moving' around, etc.  Hey,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's a very good working model for our current condition, but it is a
</EM><BR>
mental
<BR>
<EM>&gt; construct that is ultimately limiting.  We might dismiss the theoretical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physicists who want to describe reality as vacuum fluctuations, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collapsing wave forms, but these people are pointing at deeper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constructions.
</EM><BR>
<P>What you are doing here is setting up the notion that perceptions are false
<BR>
and models that abstract from them are true.  But the models are built up on
<BR>
perceptions.  So, if the former are wrong, so are the latter.  Instead, I
<BR>
would offer, perceptions are true.  Models we build from them -- and you
<BR>
must be able to perceive the results of, say, a particle accelerator
<BR>
experiment; you have to be able to read the charts or hear you colleagues
<BR>
explanations, etc. -- are true insofar as both the grounding (the
<BR>
perceptions!) and the conceptual level (abstraction, logic, and
<BR>
generalization) are valid and true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And I do not.  I am of the understanding that on this planet we are barely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the intelligence to walk around upright and dress ourselves.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quite prepared to make definitive statements about the nature of
</EM><BR>
everything
<BR>
<EM>&gt; just yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Awareness is always limited, but this does not mean it is not aware of
<BR>
reality.  A young child might be aware that it's a sunny day without being
<BR>
aware of how the sun produces energy, how far away it is, what drives the
<BR>
weather, and how her sensory systems work.  You appear to be setting up a
<BR>
false dichotomy from either knowing everything or knowing nothing.  If so,
<BR>
how can you know your senses are limited?  Or that we are barely aware?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The fact that a person can be fooled into thinking that an illusion is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *not* mean that a separate reality exists. It simply means that people
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fooled.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly.  And it is in the realization that we can be fooled that allows
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; mind to open to the possibility that all this ain't real either (or the
</EM><BR>
next
<BR>
<EM>&gt; level, or the next level...)
</EM><BR>
<P>But what is wrong here?  Are the perceptions wrong or the judgments made
<BR>
from them?  I argue the latter is the case.  For example, when I see the
<BR>
surface of the road reflecting and distorting light on a hot day, I might
<BR>
conclude there's water ahead.  In fact, what is going on is not that my
<BR>
perceptions are playing me false.  Both bodies of water under certain
<BR>
conditions and dry land under certain conditions appear similar.  My eyes
<BR>
are lying to me.  I would just be making a false generalization -- viz.,
<BR>
assuming that only bodies of water have that sort of affect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do hold however, that there are very practical ways in which we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; leverage the plasticity of our perception of reality into control over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; reality.  If I could sit you down in a room and have a conversation
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; about it, I would, because a written explanation would be tiresome--
</EM><BR>
I'd
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have to spend too much time convincing you I was talking about
</EM><BR>
something
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; rational.  Indeed, extremely rational.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ah, but how do you know it's *really* rational, rather than merely a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; illusion?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah, you see, now you've started this conversation down what I consider to
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the interesting road.  I -do- believe in a type of reality-- the realm of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
