<EM>&gt;  &gt; 1) libertarian politics - which I regard as destructive, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; lacking in compassion, humanity and empathy, ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I can lie back and take abuse sometimes, but this is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  too much.  Nadia, this statement is ignorant, pompous, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  just about diametrically opposite of reality.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Lee, I am very familiar with your position on politics, and your position on 
<BR>
social interaction. Your attitude looks to ME like this: Tough shit. Toughs 
<BR>
shit about how others feel - I hear it time and time again from you. I call 
<BR>
that lack of empathy. 
<BR>
<P><P>The most
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  greedy, heartless bastards I know personally are all self-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  proclaimed &quot;compassionate&quot; liberals who think the wolrd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  owes them and their causes something for nothing.
</EM><BR>
<P>This may be true, but it does not excuse the lack of sloutions proposed in 
<BR>
libertarian politics. It is one thing to call something wrong, and quite 
<BR>
another to come up with viable solutions. When I said destructive, I meant 
<BR>
it. Punk rock was effective at  dismantling music, what it didn't have was 
<BR>
anything good to offer in return.  What kids got now is rap - which equals 
<BR>
crap. That is how I see libertarians. Angry at the system with nothing to 
<BR>
replace it with, so we can just tear it down and see what sprouts. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  rest of us actually have to work and earn our keep--and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  yours.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Excuse me, but I am not taking any money from you. I work too, and damn hard.
<BR>
<P>And most of us are quite generous with others, and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  don't mind spreading it around a bit (even though we may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  resent it being taken by force).  Compassion at gunpoint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is not compassion at all--it is the liberal point of view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that denies the existence of compassion, that assumes and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  counts on people to be the greedy bastards liberals think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  everyone is but them, when the reality is that they just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  want the state to take control so they don't have to feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  guilty about not giving of themselves voluntarily.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  next time you see a hungry homeless man on the street, ask
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  yourself what would be of more benefit to him: (1) empathy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  compassion, and humanity; or (2) water, food, and shelter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Now, what economic system is likely to produce the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  water, food, and shelter for the most people?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I have heard this argument over and over and over, ad nauseum. I have yet to 
<BR>
see any proof that your system provides homeless people with shelter. In fact 
<BR>
you seem to want to shut down any agencies that are in existence, and rely on 
<BR>
some sort of vague charity that is yet to be born. 
<BR>
What can you say that will convince me this i nothing but a cop out and a 
<BR>
poor excuse for NOT doing more about a very serious problem, which stems 
<BR>
mainly from the large polupation of mentally ill wandering the streets. To 
<BR>
say they should just 'get a job' - after you feed them (???? though you just 
<BR>
refused to feed ME, who you have at least a nodding aquaintance with)  when 
<BR>
they are unhirable without intervention, is heartless and also innefective. 
<BR>
Nothing is that simple.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'll take on a rational argument about the failure of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  market in certain places anytime, and I'll even concede a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  few points.  But this emotional bullshit deserves no respect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and needs to be ridiculed for what it is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>um, I thought no one &quot;deserves&quot; anything  ; - )
