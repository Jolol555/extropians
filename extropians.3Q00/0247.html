<P><EM>&gt; More to point, I suspect, is that the `rigid coding'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just sets the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machinery in motion. Much of development is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stochastic and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selected/darwinnowed by exploratory activity within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the local environment,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially in the immune system and the brain's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neural organisation.
</EM><BR>
<P>this is true with respect to the development of the
<BR>
phenotype at the macro level, yes; for example, a
<BR>
mutation occurring early in the development of a maize
<BR>
plant and giving rise to resistance to the Aspergillus
<BR>
fungus but simultaneously resulting in fewer viable
<BR>
seeds would cause only grief to its bearer except
<BR>
during seasons of unusually dry weather. this is due
<BR>
to the fact that Aspergillus fungus thrives under
<BR>
dry-weather conditions. this is &quot;darwinism&quot; at work in
<BR>
a stochasic environment.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I don't think transposons leap about inside the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;differentiated cells of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;phenotypes, but rather during the formation of new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;germline cells - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case one `tight logical program' would be replaced by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a minor variant.
</EM><BR>
<P>at the molecular level, changes do regularly occur
<BR>
within cell lines throughout the lifetime of an
<BR>
organism. although the greatest amount of research has
<BR>
been conducted using bacteria, maize has also been
<BR>
studied, and transposition can take place in somatic
<BR>
cells as well as germ cells.
<BR>
<P>the mechanism by which transposition takes place is
<BR>
not well understood, but it does not appear always to
<BR>
occur randomly. transposition can be inhibited under
<BR>
certain physiological conditions such as DNA
<BR>
methylation. thus, a host can &quot;permit&quot; transpostion or
<BR>
not.
<BR>
<P>one of the primary methods of detecting the presence
<BR>
of transposons is to look for changes in how the
<BR>
genetic line interacts with its environment.  such
<BR>
changes in bacteria would include a newly acquired
<BR>
resistance to drugs, indicating that transposons
<BR>
expedite the evolutionary process.
<BR>
<P>as to whether transposition is rightly thought of as
<BR>
operating under a system of &quot;rigid coding,&quot; no doubt
<BR>
the process is subject to the same constraints as any
<BR>
other sereies of chemical reactions. there are rules;
<BR>
however, the sequence of events seems to more closely
<BR>
resemble jazz than symphonic music.
