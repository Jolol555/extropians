<EM>&gt;Are you so very, very sure that you know better than the people running the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facilities?  If the people with enough understanding and experience to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;created an AI tell you firmly that they have devoted considerable time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effort to Friendliness and they believe the chances are as good as they'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ever get, would you really nuke them?  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And scientists and engineers are, by and large, benevolent - they may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;express that benevolence in unsafe ways, but I'm willing to trust to good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intentions.  After all, it's not like I have a choice.

<P>A week earlier, Eliezer S. Yudkowsky wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; EarthWeb is more easily acchievable, by definition friendly to human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; goals, and possibly sufficient for preventing runaway techno-disaster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;On the contrary; the Earthweb is only as friendly as it is smart.  I really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't see why the Earthweb would be benevolent.  Benevolent some of the time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yes, but all of the time?  The Earthweb is perfectly capable of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mistakes that are outright stupid, especially if it's an emotionally charged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issue being considered for the first time.
</EM><BR>
<P>These two quotes seem worth comparing.  Eliezer distrusts the scenario of
<BR>
EarthWeb becoming smarter and smarter, with more and more input from
<BR>
advanced software as available, because people can be emotional.   But he
<BR>
thinks we should trust researchers creating a big bang AI, because
<BR>
scientists are benevolent.  This seems to me the Spock theory of who to
<BR>
trust - let scientists run things because they aren't emotional, and don't
<BR>
let markets run things, because they might let just any emotional
<BR>
person have influence.
<BR>
<P>Of course if people realized that scientists knew better and should be
<BR>
trusted, then non-scientists wouldn't bet against scientists in a market,
<BR>
and scientists would effectively run an EarthWeb.  But since people are
<BR>
too stupid to know who their rightful betters are, Eliezer prefers to
<BR>
impose on them the choice they wouldn't choose for themselves.
