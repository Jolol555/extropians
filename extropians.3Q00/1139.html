<P>
A further question was raised off list about the ShapeChanger `randomiser',
<BR>
and I think I might have to creep away in silent shame. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I usually try to avoid strong language, but the phrase &quot;total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bullshit&quot; comes to mind.  Deterministic is deterministic.  It's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computer.  Everything inside the box is deterministic.  It doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter how complex their random-number algorithm is; unless they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually have a radioactive isotope in there, it's deterministic.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could accept user input - PGP wants you to move the mouse around before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it generates a random key - and then they would have user-influenced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;numbers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I take it what's being said here is this: even if the sloppiness of Windows
<BR>
makes the sampled data *unpredictable* to a human, nonetheless they occur
<BR>
in a deterministic sequence that is set in ineluctable motion from the
<BR>
moment the seed enters the algorithm. This would be good enough for a
<BR>
precognition experiment, say, but not for one of mental *influence*. Unless
<BR>
psychokinesis is directly modifying the electronic structure or
<BR>
flow-processes of the machine (and maybe this is their model of how it
<BR>
allegedly works?), switching bits from ones to zeroes, etc, this process
<BR>
really just is NOT random in the sense needed to allow the device to
<BR>
register anomalous biasing inputs.
<BR>
<P>If I hear any more promising in rebuttal from Dr Haarland I'll pass it along.
