<EM>&gt;What if the first upload is a cryonics patient, who is legally &quot;dead&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What about the apparent majority today who can't accept a machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being &quot;conscious&quot;?  What if the first upload company keeps their uploads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from talking with and interacting with ordinary people in &quot;human&quot; ways?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Software just does useful things; you can't see how.)  And what if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you can make *trillions* of dollars selling such software service?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Won't that motivate them to do what ever paperwork/lobbying it takes?
</EM><BR>
<P>Curt Adams commented:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;People can and do deny the obvious.  Something like 40% of Americans believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the world was created in a big &quot;poof&quot; 6000 years ago.  Slightly over a century
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ago most people thought that women were intellectually incapable and Africans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were basically a different species, in spite of extensive evidence against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;both propositions.  ...  Many, many, people will be profoundly motivated 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that thinking machines aren't &quot;really&quot; thinking and that they do not deserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human-like rights.  I predict they will believe what they want to believe; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my experience the readiness to accept disproof of cherished beliefs is a rare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;character.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I have the stat handy, in 1999 Gallup found that 47% in US believe God
<BR>
created humans in basically their present form in the last 10,000 years or so.
<BR>
<P>Hal Finney responded:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Paperwork and lobbying won't necessarily do the job if people are morally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opposed to the project.  Look at the genetically modified food issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we have been discussing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but is it so clear what the directions of people's &quot;moral&quot; dispositions
<BR>
are in this case?  To march against violation of cryonics patients, people
<BR>
would have to accept cryonics patients as being alive, and therefor that they
<BR>
have been killing most of the elderly humanity for many decades.  To march
<BR>
against upload working conditions, people would have to accept machines as
<BR>
conscious, as well as think of upload VR palaces as miserable places.  There
<BR>
seems to be far more basis to let people think of uploads as inhuman as there
<BR>
ever was to think of black slaves as inhuman.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Using cryonic suspendees as the guinea pigs for uploading experiments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be the height of immorality.  They can in no sense be considered to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have given informed consent. I couldn't see it happening in a political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;climate like today's.  Even for the illegal labs, suspendees would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make good subjects for the uploaders, as their brains are likely to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in worse conditions than fresh brains, and the personalities involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are not only unknown but probably quirky at best.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cryonics patients should continue to be frozen, and many could certainly
<BR>
give consent.  If by &quot;informed&quot; you mean given a detailed description of
<BR>
specific experiments, no they couldn't, but that applies to just about
<BR>
any cryonics revival procedure.  I agree that quirky personalities would
<BR>
be a negative, but perhaps not an overwhelming one.  I think the worst
<BR>
conditions of brains will be manageable - you would have already verified
<BR>
your models of neurons in dishes and in animals.  At this point you just
<BR>
need to infer original structure through the cracks, which should be
<BR>
easier with vitrification.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Keeping the existence of the upload secret seems highly problematic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you're using the upload to do intelligent work, that probably is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to require a certain amount of natural language I/O.  You'd have to screen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his outputs to make sure he's not saying, &quot;Help!  I'm stuck in this box!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't talking about secrecy, just keeping it out of people's faces.
<BR>
People seem to accept &quot;taking advantage&quot; of others in all sorts of ways as
<BR>
long as it isn't vivid to them.  People give to panhandlers and say no to
<BR>
mailed charity letters.  People happily buy products from foreigners working
<BR>
in conditions they would be outraged to see their neighbors working in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Plus, what are the odds that the destructive upload is going to work,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;first time?  Most things don't.  A number of people are going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;killed before you get an upload that works.  The moral opposition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such an effort would be overwhelming, especially when it comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who will be put out of work if it succeeds.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again to get upset about the destruction of a frozen head you had to
<BR>
accept it as alive in the first place.  And the risk of a destructive
<BR>
scan failing to pick up the relevant info is different from the risk
<BR>
of any one simluation not being tuned right.
<BR>
<P>Now opposition due to fears of being put out of work is a whole
<BR>
different matter.  But it isn't the same thing as these other &quot;moral&quot;
<BR>
concerns you've mentioned.
