<EM>&gt; Hello,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would like to ask other peoples' ideas about weather control.  Can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rain, hurricanes and lightning be organized?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think there are technical methods that could be explored to see how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do some of those kinds of things in terms of altering weather patterns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are almost certainly researches about this kind of thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ther was a science article in Analog around 10-15 years ago in which the
<BR>
author proposed very large cooling tower-like structures to be placed in
<BR>
hurricane susceptible regions.  By large, read 6 km high by 1 km wide-
<BR>
these would work by encouraging a single large, efficient convection
<BR>
cell in place of many smaller ones, without disruption due to surface
<BR>
and midaltitude winds.  The updraft would improve heat transfer from the
<BR>
surface to high altitude, resulting in local cooling and
<BR>
dehumidification to remove the power source for hurricanes (compare to
<BR>
the siphons proposed for Lake Nyos in the Cameroon to prevent another
<BR>
CO2 eruption).
<BR>
<P>The condensation of water in the updraft would make it much warmer and
<BR>
thus lighter than the air outside the tower, providing the power to
<BR>
drive the circulation.
<BR>
<P>The updraft would be fast enough to skydive in, and wind turbines near
<BR>
the base could tap off some of the power in the draft.  Condensation in
<BR>
the tower could be captured and lowered through hydro turbines to
<BR>
generate more power- and would be a useful source of fresh water.
<BR>
<P>A strong rain cloud would pour out the top, producing continuous rain in
<BR>
the region downwind of the tower.  The environmental impact statement
<BR>
would be prodigious...
