Am I safe because I'm a nobody, a poor person living on trash land that no

one else wanted?  I don't know.  When is the time to stand and fight, and 
<BR>
when is the time to say, &quot;Count me out of this game&quot; ?  Am I paranoid
<BR>
because of my bad experience? I hear of this sort of thing happening
<BR>
everywhere, but maybe I exaggerate the problem in my mind.

<P>Bonnie, you have had some very scary experiences.  I am glad you had the 
<BR>
presence of mind and courage to deal successfully with both situations.  How 
<BR>
odd that a scumbag who might have raped you acted &quot;polite&quot; when you told him 
<BR>
of your illness.
<BR>
<P>So, you might have ended up an innocent victim in the war on drugs.  Any 
<BR>
dogs you might have had would have been shot and the feds might have gone 
<BR>
into &quot;shoot anything that moves&quot; mode.  I don't know.  They might be decent 
<BR>
men at home who believe in what they are doing, hard to say.
<BR>
<P>I doubt being a poor &quot;nobody&quot; makes someone safe.  Frankly, I think being a 
<BR>
lawyer and driving a nice car(with University of ____ law school decal in 
<BR>
clear view) with matching nice clothes would give you a great deal of 
<BR>
protection from rogue law-enforcement people.
<BR>
<P>Being bullies, they don't want to mess with someone who can shove back, and 
<BR>
who may have friends who could spend a lot of time, money and influence to 
<BR>
investigate things if a disappearance or death occurred
<BR>
which did not seem right.
<BR>
<P>I've noticed how when I'm dressed very nicely the police treat me much more 
<BR>
respectfully.  And I have seen on tv how cops are much more deferential in 
<BR>
the wealthy neighborhoods.
<BR>
<P>Anchorage has probably one of the most professional(and well-paid) police 
<BR>
departments in the nation.  We are a fairly wealthy city and brutality is 
<BR>
not well tolerated here.
<BR>
<P>Some folks on the force did have a problem with sticky fingers.  The &quot;vault&quot; 
<BR>
at the police station where drugs and money were kept had a long record of 
<BR>
having unauthorized withdrawals! lol  The city legislature put a stop to it 
<BR>
with a new vault which is very high-tech and has everything videotaped and 
<BR>
monitored.  Only a few on the force now have access to it and there is 
<BR>
always a clerk/guard there.  Not fullproof, but definitely better.
<BR>
<P>The FBI just expanded their new headquarters here to include a huge garage.  
<BR>
The whole complex is a big brown building(aesthetically pleasing) in the 
<BR>
middle of downtown.  A high black steel fence surrounds most of it and 
<BR>
videocameras cover every angle, I don't blame them for being careful.  
<BR>
Despite some things they have done in the past, I do have a high regard for 
<BR>
the FBI.  It broke my heart when the local Alaska bureau head, a very nice 
<BR>
African-American man who did a lot in the community, was caught by the APD 
<BR>
drunk driving!  I bet the APD loved it!  He was soon after replaced by an 
<BR>
agent out of Texas.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
