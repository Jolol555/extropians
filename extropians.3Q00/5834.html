<EM>&gt; &gt;Laser sights on a handgun tend to make it a better persuader- seeing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;spot on one's groin makes even the most aggressive attacker think twice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;by making the promise &quot;I will maim you&quot; instead of &quot;I will kill you,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;introducing a shade of gray into the life or death equation.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;maiming potential of a sword is what gives it its psychological power,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but Aleta was fortunate the perps did not have firearms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maiming may be part of it, but I think there are (at least) three factors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that make a weapon more intimidating, when brandished by a credible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assailant:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - apparent inevitability of serious consequences (a spot from a laser sight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on your chest vs. just a gun pointed at you)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - a fearsome form (a tommy gun is more threatening than a rifle because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone has seen Cagney movies)
</EM><BR>
<P>Which tommy gun? Actually, since there were several models of tommy gun, and my
<BR>
own impressions of each, I actually think the vertical fore-end grip and the
<BR>
circumferential fins on the original barrel of the original model (the one that
<BR>
most people associate with 'the tommy gun') are what make it most impressive,
<BR>
and the 100 round drum magazine helps as well, I think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - physical size of the weapon (the risk of maiming from a sword may be no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater than from a knife, but a sword is scarier)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, my M-11/9 is a small thing, and much less intimidating than my buddy's
<BR>
M-60, despite the fact that at close range the M-11 is ballistically and
<BR>
tactically superior to the M-60.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, they can be combined.  Imagine if you will, a V-22 Osprey in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helicopter mode is hovering before you.  Eighteen inches from your face,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tracking your every movement, are three barrels of a turreted fifty-caliber
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machine gun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmn.  Now I know what to get Mike for Christmas! :-).
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, could you make it a six barrelled vulcan cannon??? I'd be in
<BR>
gruntvana... ;)
<BR>
<P>The V-22 is one sweet hellcat of a VTOL, for sure. There was, though, this
<BR>
research helicopter in the 80's that had counter-rotating blades, and turbofans
<BR>
on the sides, with a Lear-jet like fuselage. I think it was called the ABC or
<BR>
something like that, and it was as fast as the V-22, I think...
