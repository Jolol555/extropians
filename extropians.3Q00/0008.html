<EM>&gt; OK, I know the Nazis were into it big time, and they weren't cool dudes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But is wanting to improve the stock a bad thing?  I have a feeling that
</EM><BR>
I'm
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; when I say on this list that it seems like a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing to want to make humans as perfect as possible.  But it seems like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtually everywhere else, the E word is as bad as the N word.  Why is
</EM><BR>
that?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>

<P>I don't think it's really necessary from here on in. Besides the thorny
<BR>
question of &quot;Who
<BR>
decides what perfect is&quot;, we've got tons of ways of supporting our
<BR>
frailties, and many
<BR>
more in the pipeline; the medical industry is geared to it. Many of those
<BR>
frailties could
<BR>
be hidden strengths, especially as you get beyond the line of out-and-out
<BR>
deadly
<BR>
heritable diseases.
<BR>
<P>It's like in the 80's, when everyone threw out their old blue jeans and
<BR>
started wearing
<BR>
acid wash. In hindsight, a big mistake. Bad for jeans, real bad for genes.
