(Quoting me)
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think a little meditation on this question -- abandoning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; preconceptions for some honest, intense thought in search of an answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; -- might change your thinking.  Your argument is not supported by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; historical evidence; therefore there must be an error in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; assumptions or your logic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is Shakespeare really relevant to a discussion regarding the digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propagation of information over a massively accessible network?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  If you reread the post I was replying to, you'll see my example
<BR>
is relevant.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I would say that the preconceptions run deep on both sides of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ebate.  -Your- arguments are not supported by 'historical evidence,'
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes they are.  Before copyright there was plenty of creative
<BR>
production.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; there's plenty of evidence that a high demand environment with protected properties
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creates a lot of innovation and profit for lots of people. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Which you've adduced where?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can't argue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the current system hasn't been successful... 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes I can.  I can argue that I believe the granting of monopolies has
<BR>
been an impediment to even greater success.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; it's taken us this far and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's unlikely we'd be here today if the starting conditions were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different.
</EM><BR>
<P>Evidence please?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (Unless you're going to argue that the massive explosion of entertainment,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual and scientific properties that has occurred over the last few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decades would have been *faster* if only those damn scientists and software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineers and movie producers had given everything away for free??)
</EM><BR>
<P>Giving things away free is not the only alternative.  This is a false
<BR>
dichotomy.
<BR>
<P>I believe, to paraphrase e.e. cummings, that regarding the progress of
<BR>
the last few decades nobody could have stopped it with all the
<BR>
policement in the world.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The -real- issue is that the arena is changing in a fundamental way--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is -now- the time to start to eliminate the concept of ownership?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, no, no, a thousand times no!  You're inventing a false dichotomy.  
<BR>
<P>Eliminate the government handouts of monopoly rights.  These are not
<BR>
property; they are a taking from the general public.  It is the
<BR>
&quot;intellectual property&quot; people who are against property and for a
<BR>
system of welfare.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll quote from Alex's recent post:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Chances are that neither of us bothers to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; track anymore-- physical scarcity is a thing of the past, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competition that exists between individuals is at subtler social and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual levels.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This sounds nice.  Utopian almost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Am I a cynic to believe that 'subtle social and intellectual competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ain't gonna hack it for the majority of the human race just yet?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand what you're arguing now, but you're apparently
<BR>
arguing with someone else (Alex?) now.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In my mind, there is only one issue.  We need to create positive feedback
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loops for behavior that we'd like to encourage.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, here is where we disagree.  I believe we ought to set people free
<BR>
to act in any way that doesn't including initiating force or fraud
<BR>
against anyone else.  I have no project to initiate positive feedback
<BR>
loops.  I'm not trying for utopia.  Freedom is good enough for me.  I
<BR>
just want to let people alone and be let alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We've got good evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regarding the feedback mechanisms that seem to be working so far.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Says you.  That is literally what your argument amounts to: things
<BR>
seem ok to you.  What if they don't seem ok to me?
<BR>
<P>We need a better philosophical starting point to avoid this disagreement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The growth of intellectual property is currently geometric.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Where are you getting these facts?
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; accruing to those individuals who come up with the best ones.  I don't want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them to make their money by advertising, or hand-outs, or public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appearances, or selling t-shirts or any of the other flimsy (IMO) means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; described in this discussion thus far.  I want them to make their money as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; direct result of meeting direct demand in the marketplace.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>And if someone else comes along to meet that demand you want the
<BR>
police to be called on that person.  That is where we disagree.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James
