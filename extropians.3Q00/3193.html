Freedom in the face of the advance of technology is a tricky subject.
<BR>
<P>I had a thought on it today.  Every person here, even the transparent
<BR>
society fans, have a debt to John the Revelator.  His notion of a mark
<BR>
of the beast, etc, has caused our society to have a kind of embedded
<BR>
fear of big brother.  This has caused us to take a most cautious
<BR>
approach
<BR>
to the advance of transparency.  
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, transparency is coming, of course, there is no stopping it, 
<BR>
and many of us do not want to.  But it is a good idea that it advances 
<BR>
slowly enough that we may have time to think out every step and 
<BR>
compensate down the influence of government as transparency increases.  
<BR>
We have time to recognize, for instance, that with increasing
<BR>
transparency, 
<BR>
the libertarian party has a chance to actually get one of ours elected 
<BR>
for a change.  spike
