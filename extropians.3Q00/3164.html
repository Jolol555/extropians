<EM>&gt;         &gt; GATT has IP provisions, I suggest you read it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It may have IP provisions, maybe, but I doubt anybody pays any attention to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And as the USA is the most important member I doubt it has anything in it that would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violate the first amendment as this would. The second any attempt was made to actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do something rather than just write a pretty treaty a USA court would shoot it down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And is it even there?  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places but I've been unable to find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything that supports your claim that &quot;countries that refuse to accept WIPO rulings get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electronically embargoed&quot;. No country has ever been &quot;electronically embargoed&quot;, not China,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not Cuba, not Iraq, not Iran, not North Korea, if information was restricted it was done from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; side not our side. I find it impossible to believe all countries would agree on such a ruling, even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they did I find it impossible to believe all would agree on the interpretation of such a ruling,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if they did I find it impossible to believe they'd be able to enforce it. All it would take is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for one other country to use a liberal interpretation of the word &quot;restriction&quot; and the floodgates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be open.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>John, that comment was a proposal for how countries that support piracy should
<BR>
be treated, so don't be fatuous. In fact, Iraq was electronically embargoed
<BR>
during the Gulf War, as an example that this is not something new.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt;remove those countries top level domains from recognition on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;servers and routers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; .com  .org  .net
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;bill the software author for all royalties unpaid as a result of people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;using his/her software.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Are you saying that if piracy was impossible people with tons of illegal software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have gone to the store and bought the stuff ?!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          &gt;&gt;Are you going to jail the maker of a word processing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;          &gt;&gt; program because somebody used it to write a ransom note?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt; That is not what we are talking about, and you ought to know that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's exactly what we're talking about and I do know it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; People that write software like napster, which their main function is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; facilitate IP piracy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Napster is a new way to distribute information, nothing more. I was just reading in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Science about using a Napster clone for scientific data instead of MP3's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any program can have legal and illegal uses.
</EM><BR>
<P>Any program can also have safeguards programmed into it that prevent illegal
<BR>
uses. &quot;Impossible&quot; is not a word to an engineer or a programmer. You ought to
<BR>
know that.
