<EM>&gt;One point that I would be interested in seeing discussed in the paper is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether this system of decision-making is often used in corporations, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it isn't, what is the reason? Is it the case that nobody has thought of
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;For large companies, it is hard to make managers interests coincide
<BR>
with those of stockholders, and managers would clearly loose a good
<BR>
deal of authority if IF markets produced good management decisions.
<BR>
Stockholders could in theory order management to use IF markets, but
<BR>
it would take a good deal of work to specify which decisions should
<BR>
be made this way, free rider problems deter most stockholders from
<BR>
making any effort, and select effects insure that most stockholders
<BR>
think their companies are managed better than average already (singling
<BR>
out one company to be the first to be dragged into a new management
<BR>
process would tend to imply that there is something subpar about the
<BR>
current management).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;There are a lot of small companies where managers own a large enough
<BR>
fraction of the company that their interests as stockholders can override
<BR>
their interests as managers, but they are usually small enough that the
<BR>
knowledge that its employees possess isn't dispersed widely enough for
<BR>
the means of using that information can be much improved by IF markets.
<BR>
&nbsp;There are significant legal obstacles to allowing non-employees to
<BR>
bet real money. Making bonuses contingent on an IF market results poses
<BR>
few legal problems, but once you allow people to invest/gamble money
<BR>
that is already their property, expensive regulations apply. There are
<BR>
enough entrenched special interests (casinos, financial markets) that
<BR>
could loose business to IF markets that legal change won't happen easily.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;A few companies such as Microsoft have neither of theses obstacles, but
<BR>
their existing management practices have produced good enough results that
<BR>
they have little incentive to experiment with alternatives.

<EM>&gt;First, the number of possible strategies is nearly infinite.  This is a

<EM>&gt;common problem in AI/robotics work as well.  For a robot to accomplish

<P>&nbsp;I.e. IF markets might &quot;merely&quot; improve the ability to compare alternatives

that companies are currently comparing, rather than enabling them to

compare alternatives that are currently being overlooked.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The obvious practical problem is that no IF market exists!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If corporations were going to piggyback on an existing IF market to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evaluate future strategies, they couldn't do so until there was such
