<P><EM>&gt; As you have correctly surmised, I am not a dolt.  Therefore I would never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argue (and have never argued) that Napstering copyrighted music is a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing for those who own the copyrights.  So sure, from the *point of view
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the artist/record company* Napster is a &quot;bad&quot; thing.  No argument there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I try to look at this question from the broadest possible view.  Not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merely from the standpoint of the copyright holders, nor merely from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standpoint of the pirates.  But from the view of trying to determine the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absolute or &quot;greater good.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, you are very slippery my friend... yes, very slippery indeed.     :)
<BR>
<P><P>A few extremely rhetorical questions:
<BR>
<P><P><P>If, however, the copyright laws cause more harm (in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; diminished free flow of data)
</EM><BR>
<P>The 'harm' of college kids not getting their 'Blink 182' for free??
<BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;than their supposed good (in stuffing the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; pocketbooks of content providers),
</EM><BR>
<P>The 'supposed' good of rewarding people who fulfill a demand?
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>I'm not saying anything intelligent in the post at all, so please feel free
<BR>
to ignore it.
<BR>
<P>Hmm, upon reflection, I suppose I should have put that statement at the top
<BR>
of this reply so you wouldn't have to read the message to realize that you
<BR>
don't need to read the message.
<BR>
<P>Although, maybe you're one of those skimmer types, who skips to the end, and
<BR>
then reads backwards.
<BR>
<P>Oh, damn, then I've screwed -that- up, because my warning is no longer at
<BR>
the end.
<BR>
<P><P><P>I -warned- you that there wasn't anything intelligent being said in this
<BR>
post!
<BR>
<P><P>Nope, still nothing, you -really- should do yourself a favor and stop
<BR>
reading now.
<BR>
<P>Think of all that other genuinely -important- email piling up in your inbox
<BR>
at this very moment.  Precious moments of your life are being consumed by
<BR>
this inane banter.  You could be taking a walk, trying to pick up chicks or
<BR>
practicing moving things with your mind.
<BR>
<P><P><P>Please have a nice day.
