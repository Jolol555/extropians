Brian Atkins writes, regarding fraudulent businesses:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Or you might say it is due to a lack of an easily searchable reputation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system that penetrates into the real world. Who wants to build one?
</EM><BR>
<P>The Better Business Bureau does try to maintain a record of complaints.
<BR>
But it's not used much, I gather.
<BR>
<P>One problem with such databases is the liability of the distributor if
<BR>
the information is challenged.  I'm not sure how the BBB gets around that.
<BR>
Maybe the inaccessibility of the information helps them to keep a low
<BR>
profile.
<BR>
<P>The cypherpunks talk about data havens, offshore or crypto-hidden
<BR>
databases which could record and disseminate information without being
<BR>
bound by legal regulations.  They would hold this kind of reputation
<BR>
information and make it available for a fee.
<BR>
<P>Such systems would have the advantage of making more information available
<BR>
which would help people to make better decisions.  On the other hand
<BR>
there would be problems with inaccurate information, plus people who
<BR>
had bad reputations would have a harder time walking away from them.
<BR>
Current credit databases are required to purge data after a certain
<BR>
number of years, but presumably an unregulated data haven would happily
<BR>
inform a creditor of your bad debts from decades past.
<BR>
<P>Without meaning to seem pitiless or tough, it is arguably valuable
<BR>
for all parties in a proposed transaction to know the history of their
<BR>
counterparts, and then to decide for themselves how much to discount or
<BR>
ignore past misbehavior.  In the present system, Big Brother in effect
<BR>
lays down the laws of mercy, saying, thou shalt forgive everything that
<BR>
happened more than X years ago (and to make sure, we'll prevent you from
<BR>
knowing about it).
