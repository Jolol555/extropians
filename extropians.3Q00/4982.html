<P><EM>&gt;You don't build an acrcology for a 10 year lifespan, however. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Consider the average apartment building - the lifespan is 20-40
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years, on average, unless there is a dramatic defect.  An arcology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be an organic structure, in that it would constantly be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;undergoing small and large changes over time.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There is indeed an overhead in the form of increased planning and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resource costs at the onset - you are basically front-loading a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large chunk of your expenses at the beginning. But consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;externalized costs of the standard diffuse settlement: transit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;networks, vast road structures, and environmental impact of so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much diffuse settlement acting as a heat source pouring excess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;heat intot he air above (an effect noted over urban areas such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Atlanta and Houston, where ambient air temperatures have increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;markedly).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There are certain types of efficiencies an arcology can add in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;social context as well.  But as long as people continue to believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the myth of &quot;battleship&quot; living, there will be no truly reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discource on arcologies, and they will continue to be simply an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artistic and architectural curiosity, rather than being one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;msot efficient forms of habitation in difficult environments (It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easier to dme a single arcology than the homes of tens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thousands of people nt he traditional urban/suburban
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;configuration)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There is alot of urban construction that mimics Arcologys. Here in
<BR>
downtown Chicago we are seeing former office buildings being
<BR>
converted to residential buildings, right in the core of the loop.
<BR>
About the only thing missing is a common roof, and centralized
<BR>
planning. (which may actually the weak link in Arcologies)
<BR>
<P>One building in the south loop is an Arcology mimic called
<BR>
Rivercity. it is actually 2 &quot;S&quot; shaped buildings that are joined by
<BR>
a common roof, yielding a large atrium in the center. The &quot;Street&quot;
<BR>
is paved in old cobblestones and is designed after streets in
<BR>
Paris. 
<BR>
<P>Interesting...
