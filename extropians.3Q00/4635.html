<P>Or you might say it is due to a lack of an easily searchable reputation

system that penetrates into the real world. Who wants to build one?

<EM> &gt; Phil Osborn writes, regarding dental scams:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; There are entire books by licensed dentists that describe exactly the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; procedures that are commonly used by dentists to ensure that you will be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; making many unhappy returns.  As Paul correctly points out, the average
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; person stands little chance going up against a professional scam 
</EM><BR>
operation.
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; They have had lots of experience working out the bugs in their legal 
</EM><BR>
warfare
<BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; kit.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It is no doubt true that there are dental frauds, as in other areas.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; And these people may well be skilled at protecting themselves in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; court system.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; But to put this in the context of the thread, this is not a problem of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;big business&quot;.  These are not giant dental conglomerates, for the most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; part (some may be chains preying on the poor, I imagine).  Many of them
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are small businessmen who are short on honesty and long on greed.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The problem is not with big business.  It is with a legal system which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; benefits knowledgeable insiders.  The practice of law is tightly closed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and regulated, which is a recipe for unfairness.
