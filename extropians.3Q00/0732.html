I just noticed that a President Barbie is being made (not news for the US list members I guess);

<P>Too bad she's not running for real prez, she'd likely be the most extropian candidate.

Perpetual progress: Barbie's been through more career changes than I can count (bigger than 3). She's continually upgrading, improving, changing. Now she's running for Prez. That's progress!
<P>Self Transformation: When you think Self Transformation, think Barbie. She's not going natural; Barbie is pure synthetic. Reminds me of a post here some time back quoting Dolly Parton.
<P>Practical Optimism: Well, she'd no pessimist. I'm not sure about practical. How does she walk, for instance?
<P>Intelligent Technology: Just ask Mattel; they'll tell you that Barbie technology is the most intelligent thing they've pursued. Also, she's made of durable plastic (even little kids don't seem to be able to break her; I've watched my daughter try). She'll be in tip-top condition, thousands of years from now.
<P>Open Society: Hmm, I haven't actually heard her campaign platform; maybe it's the original blank-slate. That's openness!
<P>Self Direction: Well, actually she's more of a puppet than a real leader; needs someone else to direct her actions. But that's no worse than any of the other candidates.
<P>Rational Thinking: Let her off the hook on this one; she's trying to be a politician, after all. She does embody a very successful memeset  - &quot;Girls nationwide own an average of eight Barbies&quot; (from the Url above). Somebody is engaged in rational thinking in Mattel's PR department.

<P>We just have to hope for Seed AI Barbie; a regular barbie, with a button on the back:
<P>&lt;push button&gt; &quot;I've just redesigned my cognitive processes; now I am 100 IQ. &lt;giggle&gt;&quot;
&lt;push button&gt; &quot;I've just redesigned my cognitive processes; now I am 200 IQ. &lt;giggle&gt;&quot;
&lt;push button&gt; &quot;I've just redesigned my cognitive processes; now I am 400 IQ. &lt;giggle&gt;&quot;
&lt;push button&gt; &quot;I've just redesigned my cognitive processes; now I am 800 IQ. &lt;giggle&gt;&quot;
