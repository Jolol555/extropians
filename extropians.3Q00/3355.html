[I suppose this could be useful for lesbians and bisexuals as well...]
<BR>
<P>A friend of mine sent me a scanned image of the following newspaper
<BR>
clipping.  Unfortunately there's no reference on the scan, so I don't
<BR>
know where it's from.  But I think it's worth a laugh --- or at least
<BR>
it's a justification for the habits of dirty old men.  :-)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AN EYEFUL A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------- by Jonathan Hayter
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staring at women's breasts is good for men's health and makes them
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live longer, a new survey reveals.  Researchers have discovered
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a 10-minute ogle at women's breasts is as healthy as a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30-minute workout in the gym.  A five-year study of 200 men found
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that those who enjoyed a longing look at busty beauties had lower
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood pressure, less heart disease and slower pulse rates compared
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those who did not get their daily eyeful.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Karen Weatherby, who carried out the German study, wrote in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine: &quot;Just 10 minutes of staring at the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charms of a well-endowed female is roughly equivalent to a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30-minute aerobics workout.  Sexual excitement gets the heart
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pumping and improves blood cicrulation.  Our study indicates that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engaging in this activity for a few minutes daily cuts the risk of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stroke an heart attack in half.  We believe that by doing so
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistently, the average man can extend his life for four to five
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She added that sexy stars like Dolly Parton, Heather Locklear, Anna
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole Smith, and Demi Moore had proved to be especially good for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men's health.
<BR>
<P>Of course, they don't mention what *else* the guys are doing while
<BR>
they're staring.  I would suspect that they might need their hands
<BR>
free for, um, manual labour, shall we say.
