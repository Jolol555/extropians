<EM> &gt; In further support of your comments, I'd add that the &quot;off switch&quot; for an AI
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; could actually terminate or delete it. This means that it would be *much* easier
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to control unruly AIs than to control human children, since we (unfortunately?)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; can't actually terminate recalcitrant or sociopathic (i.e., unfriendly) human
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; children.
</EM><BR>
<P>I like children, but sometimes watching a sick (and cranky) 1.5 year
<BR>
old for 5 hours straight did make me sometimes wish for a
<BR>
suspend/resume button.
<BR>
<P>Children are surprisingly efficient disruptors of mental processes
<BR>
(well, perhaps less surprising, since being information vampires). It
<BR>
is perhaps not so hard for parents, who are flooded with endogenous
<BR>
euphorica, since smitten with their offspring, but that couple did
<BR>
complain a bit.
<BR>
<P>In absence of suspend/resume, are there any kid rentals out there? ;)
