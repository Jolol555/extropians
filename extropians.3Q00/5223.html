<EM>&gt;  &gt; Management does not completely dissapear, but it mutates...and there is

<EM>&gt;  &gt; certainly a lot less of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder what makes you say that. All successful OpenSource projects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the size beyond the trivial are extremely centralistically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organized. The project can have (very) many contributors, but still a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; single person decides on the architecture issue and which piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; code gets incorporated, and which not.
</EM><BR>
<P>True...almost.
<BR>
<P>If a large number of the developers get dissatisfied with the decisions
<BR>
of the manager, any of the developers can take the code base and fork
<BR>
it.  The central manager would have to screw up big time in order to
<BR>
provoke such a reaction, but it is possible - and that, alone, can keep
<BR>
the manager honest.
<BR>
<P>As in proprietary projects, it is possible for the central person to
<BR>
divide the project into multiple parts, each one headed by a different
<BR>
person.  Or maybe some parts arise naturally, with a de facto leader -
<BR>
again, just like in proprietary projects, except that &quot;official&quot;
<BR>
recognition can come from the developers directly even if the central
<BR>
leader disagrees.
<BR>
<P>The central manager is motivated by making the project good, rather than
<BR>
by marketing or sales to *any* degree.  Users feed directly back into
<BR>
the system, rather than going through salespersons' and marketers'
<BR>
biases.  (See, for example, commercial execs who honestly believe that
<BR>
customers want to put the company's bottom line ahead of utility to
<BR>
customers, because they're told that by those who report to them, who in
<BR>
turn think that's what the exec wants to hear and they'd be fired if
<BR>
they said otherwise.)
<BR>
<P>Developers can add themselves at whim; management does not have to think
<BR>
to hire them - or even know that they exist - before the developers can
<BR>
start making contributions.  Developers who do not contribute anything
<BR>
do not wind up costing the project anything; likewise, the central
<BR>
manager must be a developer (probably writing code directly, but at
<BR>
least be technically competent), else few other developers would be
<BR>
willing to listen.  This last one enforces knowledge of how to build a
<BR>
good system, which is perhaps *the* single most mutating factor
<BR>
(relative to proprietary development) I've cited...and I'm sure I'm
<BR>
missing some factors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anarchic software development does not work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Define &quot;anarchic&quot;.  No body of law ties, say, Linux developers to Linus
<BR>
Torvaldis.  Linus can not hire or fire developers; he can only make
<BR>
acceptance of their code more or less likely.  (He can't even absolutely
<BR>
reject software on his own, though his negative review can go a long way
<BR>
towards rejecting certain code.)  Promises, trust, and working code are
<BR>
all that unify the developers - and this lack of law is, technically,
<BR>
&quot;anarchy&quot;, in the form that some promoters of anarchy envision as their
<BR>
utopia.
