<EM>&gt; I guess you didn't read what I said. I understand what you are saying.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My own father has had repeat battles with a blood infection that swelled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up his legs like elephantiasis, and they had to bring out what his doc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calls 'the big guns' to finally whip it. What I was saying though, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that if there were resistant strains in the meat, then those strains got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resistant due to an incomplete or insufficient treatment of antibiotics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IN THE COW (NOT you). So the point is, it suggests the farmer is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giving the cow a sufficient dose of anti-biotics to wipe out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bacteria, NOT that its wrong he's giving them it at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry Mike, but you dont know what you're talking about.  The more antibiotics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you use the more likely the bacteria will develop resistance.  Anti-biotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resistant strains of bacteria do not arise because the bacteria adapt to a low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level of antibiotic in their environment.  The strain arises because some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the population are already resistant to that antibiotic and it is their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offspring which survive in that environment.  Giving cows more antibiotics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would make the situation worse, not better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Listen to what you are saying:
<BR>
<P>'the more anti-biotics you use, the more likely the bacterial will develop
<BR>
resistance'
<BR>
<P>if this were so, then use of antibiotics on humans would have long ago developed
<BR>
resistant strains. ALL doctors I talk to have said that resistant strains arise
<BR>
as a result of patients not completing the full regimen of anti-biotics they are
<BR>
prescribed, patients who stop taking them when they 'feel better', NOT when all
<BR>
the pills are gone, which is how TB has gotten so resistant, and is primarily
<BR>
found in a segment of the population least likely to take the advice of a
<BR>
doctor: poor minority and homeless people. Dairy farmers, at least the ones I
<BR>
know, are a VERY stingy lot. &quot;Waste not, want not&quot; and other such aphorisms are
<BR>
their creed. I can completely believe that a farmer, being typically a rather
<BR>
independent minded person,  would stop giving his cows anti-biotics when they
<BR>
started looking better, and NOT when the Vet said to stop, thus likely creating
<BR>
a similarly insufficient course of treatment that is likely to breed resistant
<BR>
bacteria.
