Winning the argument with &quot;throw weight&quot; seems to be less effective than 
<BR>
spin and doublespeak according to our current political environment
<BR>
<P>the most rational argument do not necessarily win in politics

<P>I'm not a fan of politics generally.  Before you start a political effort
<BR>
you want a huge collected organized &quot;body of knowledge&quot; that creates
<BR>
a relatively unassailable position (before you try to turn everyone's
<BR>
very strong beliefs upside down).  [This is what I refer to as winning
<BR>
the argument with &quot;throw weight&quot;.]

<P>Someone was on Charlie Rose the other night.  He related a story
<BR>
about where Mario Cumo had offered to let the NY Times *grill* him
<BR>
about the economy and his position on various aspects of it.  He
<BR>
sat with the reporters for *12 hours* answering questions.  Someone
<BR>
commented that they *still* talk about it today.  That is the kind
<BR>
of depth and commitment you need to move this forward.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If all we can currently do at this stage is to talk (...please, this is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; not to give offense...) let's do the talk effectively.

<P>Call up Peter Passaro at the Maximum Life Foundation.  Tell him
<BR>
you want to assist in gathering information, doing research,
<BR>
writing documents, organizing a local chapter, etc.  I'm sure he
<BR>
will find plenty for you to do.
