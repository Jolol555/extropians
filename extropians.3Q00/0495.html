From: &quot;altamira&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:altamira@ecpi.com?Subject=re:%20human/world%20interfaces&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b58bea5446ff@[149.217.0.155]&gt;">altamira@ecpi.com</A>&gt;, Date: Thu, 6 Jul 2000:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Later, I expanded my selfish motivations to include the possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of improving my communications skills.  If I could figure out how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most people interfaced with the world, I'd be able to imagine how it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;felt to be them, and then I'd stand a better chance of saying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right things to them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Knowing a person's personality type can be quite helpful in this
<BR>
regard. There are many personality type &quot;systems&quot;.  I like &quot;systems&quot;
<BR>
anyway, including personality-typing systems, and so I like
<BR>
observing people, asking a few questions, and figuring out some
<BR>
things about their personality type. Once I have a handle on what
<BR>
their basic motivations are, then I have some idea for how to
<BR>
interact with them. I'm a highly sensitive person anyway, and this
<BR>
helps me to see the world through their eyes. If I didn't have some
<BR>
tool to help me though, I would probably feel a little bit lost in
<BR>
knowing how to interact with people. I chose my scientific field
<BR>
partly because the Universe is much more comprehensible to me than
<BR>
are people.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;(people used to say of me that I was off in my own little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;god-knows-where world)(my brother once suggested that I might be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic, but I don't think I quite fit that category
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either)
</EM><BR>
<P>Has anyone here ever been classified as autistic? If so, I would be
<BR>
interested in learning how that experience has shaped you. I had
<BR>
some large childhood communication difficulties (not autistic though)
<BR>
that I'm sure shaped my interface with the world.
