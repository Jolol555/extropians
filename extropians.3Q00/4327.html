Michael S. Lorrey
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Socio/psychopathic minds are sick/malfunctioning minds. Proper oversight
</EM><BR>
systems
<BR>
<EM>&gt; should quickly put any sociopathic/psychopathic SI down. Such control
</EM><BR>
mechanisms
<BR>
<EM>&gt; would be a primary area of research by the Singularity Institute I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>We don't really have any reason to presume that SIs would not emerge from
<BR>
genetic programming projects, do we? As AIs compete with each other, winners
<BR>
would evolve with higher and higher IQs. Those intelligent agents (IAs) that
<BR>
display unfriendly tendencies could simply be terminated. This is a tremendous
<BR>
advantage of working with Mind Children, because you can't (legally or
<BR>
ethically) do this with biological children. As the evolution of AI moves toward
<BR>
SI, all you need to do to preclude unfriendliness is to cull to herd, so to
<BR>
speak.
