<EM>&gt; I'm working on a piece and I'd like to run it by you all and see if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has any suggestions or contributions that might be relevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What I'm looking for is an analogy for how we interpret information in ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are diverse and/or contradictory.  The analogy would reflect how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concepts can be understood from, say, two diverse perspectives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A visual example might be looking at a hologram and it would provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different images depending the eye level or viewpoint when looking at it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If one only saw the hologram from one viewpoint, he or she would miss the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full meaning or interpretation of the picture.
</EM><BR>
<P>When looking at a mirror, we each see something different.
<BR>
<P>One problem with english is that it is not self correcting, so self
<BR>
contradictory statements are parseable and understandable, like: This sentence
<BR>
is a lie. or: Slavery is Freedom. Ancient Indo-European was far more stringent
<BR>
and self correcting, which is one reason why ancient societies were far more
<BR>
structured, and why there was such differentiation between castes and genders. A
<BR>
thing either was what it was or it was not. There was no fuzziness, such that if
<BR>
part of a message was lost, what was lost could be easily interpolated by the
<BR>
context of the remainder, because writing technology did not exist, so written
<BR>
records could not be referred to, it was all a matter of the memory of the tale
<BR>
teller. Gendered verbs, gendered nouns, etc. all helped ensure the accuracy of
<BR>
memorized records.
<BR>
<P>Understanding their point of view can be made thusly: imagine that there is no
<BR>
word for snow, for ice, for sleet, for rain, for floods, ponds, lakes, rivers,
<BR>
slush, hail, etc. That any noun made of water is just 'water'. If we only had
<BR>
the word 'water' to describe any object made of water, no matter what its state
<BR>
or condition, then we would have to qualify the word water with descriptors:
<BR>
frozen still surface water, wavy salt water, flaky frozen falling water, etc...
<BR>
If the memory of a tale teller or message courier loses the 'flaky' from 'flaky
<BR>
frozen falling water', then that could mean hail, sleet, snow, avalanche,
<BR>
blizzard, snowballs, etc... Information is lost, and therefore understanding is
<BR>
lessened.
