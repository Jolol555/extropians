<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  Thinking it is unfair for kids to get advantages from rich parents

<EM>&gt; &gt;  (&quot;trust-fund kids&quot;) *is* one of the main predictions of my theory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To be more exact, I think that your theory would predict that we would think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it fair to let rich parents lavish money on their kids (a view I suspect that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most folks hold) but not necessarily fair to let those kids benefit from such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gifts (a view that, paradoxically or not, people also often hold).
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, if you could have both those things, yes, people would go for that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So far, so good.  But you could argue that inheriting wealth from the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source from which you inherit your genes signals genetic fitness.  Indeed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterintuitively, your theory seems to suggest that *adopted* trust fund
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kids should be regarded as somehow less morally deserving than *natural*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones!  The theory thus seems to vary from some moral intuitions. Or maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not; as you note, we really need better data about moral intuitions.
</EM><BR>
<P>This depends on how much of a selection process there is in adoption.If rich folks
<BR>
are more likely to adopt healthy fit looking children, then
<BR>
the fact that an adoptee's parents are rich would also signal their fitness.
<BR>
Of course if this effect is weaker than the direct parent effect in our ancestor's
<BR>
<P>environment, your conclusion would be right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm puzzled that you say, &quot;It seems unfair to suffer greatly from having one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or two specific bad genes.&quot;  Granted, that probably seems unfair to most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks, but doesn't your theory in fact predict that people should regard such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad genes as clear signals of unfitness, and thus that people should think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that suffering from them is not unfair?
</EM><BR>
<P>The point was that we mainly want a signal about the average fitness of awhole
<BR>
genome.  You could have one or two specific bad genes even if
<BR>
the rest of your genome were great.  Consider Lou Gerig's (sp?) disease.
<BR>
What a shame that such a fit person suffered from few bad genes.
