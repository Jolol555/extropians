&lt;The only thing I noticed is that even when governments 'collapsed' the new
<BR>
Italian governments would frequently re-install the same cabinet members,
<BR>
perhaps hoping for a means to vote away a 'deadlock'? More interesting to me
<BR>
is how Italian bussiness leaders and families were able to produce a decent
<BR>
standard of living with all what we American's would superficially, see as
<BR>
chaotic? This may be considered an unheralded Italian success story, and
<BR>
perhaps a lesson for the future?&gt;
<BR>
<P>Difficult questions. But I had, in my family, during the last 140 years, 3
<BR>
senators and 2 deputies, from different parties. So I am ready to answer.
<BR>
<P>1. They re-install the same cabinet (sometimes, or often, a cabinet which is
<BR>
worse or weaker) because the *real* government is somewhere else. The *real*
<BR>
government is spread, is located in the political system: those parties
<BR>
(just one in the '30s, about 48 right now) and those trade unions. And some
<BR>
political *power* (mafia, cosa nostra, ndrangheta, camorra, stidda, sacra
<BR>
corona, masonic churchs, masonic and hidden sects, terrorists, etc. ) was
<BR>
(is) also out of the political system. So the government is just a *virtual*
<BR>
entity, sometimes without a real majority. But if some agreement is
<BR>
stipulated by those parties (and *churchs* and trade unions) the government
<BR>
runs even without a parliamentary majority. Or, if you prefer, the
<BR>
government (even the strongest one) can not run if that agreement breaks
<BR>
down. In example when the Nato forces attacked Milosevic, italian government
<BR>
was in trouble because 2 communist parties (in the majority) voted against
<BR>
that war. But the government had a sudden help from the right side!
<BR>
<P>2. Right. Italy is *always* in chaos. But this chaos means (also) that
<BR>
controls are loose. And this means that we had a *black* economy which was
<BR>
very very strong. And this *black* money was our escape (this money financed
<BR>
the national expense too!). But now, after the EU, controls are stronger
<BR>
.... and economy seems to be weaker.
