<EM>&gt; &gt;In the spirit of survivor, I propose a new sport, the optimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;strategy of which is unclear.  The game is to see who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;walk (or run) the greatest distance, assuming that the competitor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;must carry *all* necessary supplies, food, water, whatever else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;might be needed.

<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Peter C. McCluskey&quot; wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This is virtually indistinguishable from an existing sport. There is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; race where people run from Badwater (in Death Valley) to Whitney Portal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which appears to be nearly 150 km by road).
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, a competitor in the Badwater to Portals is a friend and former
<BR>
neighbor, Gil Cornell.  They made a huge deal of his competing and
<BR>
(I believe) winning that race when he was a grandfather.  Nowthen,
<BR>
it was a bit misleading to suggest a wisened old man winning
<BR>
an ultramarathon, for tho he was technically a grandfather, he got there
<BR>
by getting in trouble in high school, then his son grew up and did
<BR>
likewise, so Gil was only 34 when his granddaughter was born. I
<BR>
can assure you, he was very much at the top of his game.
<BR>
<P>My comment to Gil was that golf and ultramarathon are among
<BR>
the few sports that will not be totally dominated by children, since
<BR>
much of the competition in ultramarathon is mental discipline, which
<BR>
the teenagers have yet to develop generally (this was before Tiger
<BR>
Woods).
<BR>
<P>Gil added that ultramarathon is one of the very few sports where
<BR>
men and women may compete more or less equally, and further
<BR>
speculated that in a much longer race women may have the advantage
<BR>
over men with their legendary greater pain threshold, etc.  This has
<BR>
been shown in the recent Eco-challenge.  Comments?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Rules about contestants carrying their own water presumably affect the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maximum distance people can manage, but I wouldn't expect them to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; major effects on the character of the race.
</EM><BR>
<P>My notion of carrying everything puts greater emphasis on strategy and
<BR>
less on who is the strongest.  Of course the one in the best condition
<BR>
still has a big advantage, but a desk jockey who does everything exactly
<BR>
right could still make a respectable showing.  It also emphasizes choosing
<BR>
the right equipment, which will change depending on the conditions.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, I have in mind designing this sport so that CRers would
<BR>
have a shot.  Generally CRers have small muscles, which takes them
<BR>
out of the hunt for almost any competition except long running or
<BR>
walking contests.  Having the event in Death Valley favors the boney,
<BR>
for with leanness comes great efficiency of the body's own
<BR>
cooling system.  A very thin person can reject sufficient heat thru
<BR>
the lungs alone to obviate much sweating thru the skin.  If you are curious,
<BR>
go to Death Valley in late September and see how it feels when
<BR>
it is about 100 degrees F and nearly zero humidity.  Its comfortable!
<BR>
Lungs are great cooling devices.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, I want a competition that allows a shot by those of us who
<BR>
labor away our lives making micro-changes in the magnetic domains
<BR>
on a spinning metallic disc in a climate controlled office.  This would
<BR>
include most of us here.  The distance walk with no stopping, no caches and
<BR>
no jettisoning of anything you started with has all these elements.  Ive
<BR>
already started choosing my equipment.  spike
