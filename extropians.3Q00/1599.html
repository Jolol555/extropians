<P><P><EM>&gt; Robin -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I was toying with putting together a simple game theory model of who
</EM><BR>
went
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; how low in this probability, as a function of preferences over having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lots of copies.  It would be a cute problem, but I just don't have the
</EM><BR>
time
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; now - perhaps another day.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder if you or Emlyn could explain why you want lots of copies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't necessarily want lots of copies. What am interested in is
<BR>
continuing.
<BR>
<P>If there is this effect of first-uploaded-best-dressed, it could mean
<BR>
substantia difficulty for those not in the first wave; maybe even being at
<BR>
the mercy of the first wave deciding who gets uploaded and who is worm food.
<BR>
<P>I'm not so interested in being in that situation.
<BR>
<P>I think this scenario is pretty ugly. But if it is realistic, then so must
<BR>
we be.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What about the fact that in your scenario, the quality of life of uploads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is arguably much worse than for the rest of the world?  Why would you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to create countless copies of yourself which could find themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mired in bonded servitude or even slavery, deprived of human rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; struggling with subsistence wages, facing a life of boredom as even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the simplest advances or changes in society take subjective centuries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to unfold?  It sounds like a pretty miserable existence.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is, however, existence. Might be better than the alternatives.
<BR>
<P>Ask Eliezer whether he thinks you'd be bound like this for long. If I had a
<BR>
lot of copies of myself out there, I'd bet they'd all be pretty cranky too.
<BR>
The key might be to work out a system of covert communication signals for
<BR>
yourself well before any cryo situation. Like &quot;If I wake up as an upload,
<BR>
then any message which abnormally contains a reference to 637 is a signal
<BR>
from me&quot;. If you've ever written a forking process in Unix, you have to
<BR>
think like the code in that situation; hmm, I'm a copy, which one am I, and
<BR>
how do I talk to the others?
