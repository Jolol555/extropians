<EM>&gt; over twenty years, and is likely gone for good.

<EM>&gt; I consider this yet another point not to take lightly

<EM>&gt; when we consider what is happening to our world every

<P><P>So what?
<BR>
<P>Even if homo sapien disappeared off the planet tomorrow, hundreds of
<BR>
species would still become extinct every year.  Why is it that many people
<BR>
seem to assume that speciation was in some sort of magical equilibrium
<BR>
until our species came along?  Extinction is an artifact of biological
<BR>
diversity.  I don't see too many homo erectus wandering around these days,
<BR>
yet no one laments their disappearance.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I am alone in this, but I don't see anything wrong with extinction
<BR>
in principle.  For every species that becomes extinct, a new one pops into
<BR>
existence to take its place, and probably does a better job of it.  I
<BR>
simply can't fathom how the government, at the direction of environmental
<BR>
groups, can spend millions or billions of dollars to save a rare insect
<BR>
that was obviously poorly adapted to survive anyway.  What a waste of
<BR>
resources.  With only a small number of exceptions, most species that
<BR>
become exinct today would have become extinct in a relatively short
<BR>
period of time anyway, with or without our help.
