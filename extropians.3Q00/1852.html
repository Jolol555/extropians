<EM>&gt;  U.S. Shoots Down Cruise Missile in Defense Test

<BR>
<P>Nah.  I volunteered to have my prediction (a hit)
<BR>
reposted with the traditional implied neeener neeener should
<BR>
the shot go awry (as it did the two times before) but John
<BR>
Clark was too much the gentleman to neener me.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>Actually I think John and I have identical goals, to
<BR>
end war, but we just have a difference on how that goal is
<BR>
to be attained.  Fair enough: there are those who believe
<BR>
that peace can be attained thru a mighty room filled with men,
<BR>
a paper they are signing says they'll never fight again.
<BR>
<P>I do not hold that opinion.  Perhaps I have a too-cynical view
<BR>
of human nature, but all treaties are temporary solutions.
<BR>
Overwhelming technology is the way to permanent peace.
<BR>
And it must be *truly* overwhelming, and Mike all of us
<BR>
will pay a price for that peace.  You and I have had differing
<BR>
views on privacy: well, you know what all this anti-missile
<BR>
tech eventually leads to, do you not?  As soon as we really
<BR>
can defeat all incontinental missiles, we need to go after the
<BR>
next level of threat, which is smuggled suitcase WMDs, and
<BR>
we know where that line of reasoning leads, do we not?
<BR>
<P>Actually I have recently been entertaining a new notion,
<BR>
that war can be ended by another, far more wonderful
<BR>
means: by choking off the profitability of it all.  Right now,
<BR>
few young people are going into military technology fields
<BR>
because mil-tech development pays considerably less than the
<BR>
commercial counterpart.  There are no stock options,
<BR>
no company furnished BMW, no IPOs, no chick-magnet
<BR>
T-shirts, no 25 year old  CEOs in lear jets.  Hell we dont really
<BR>
even have company picnics.  Mil-tech aint sexy.  But I would
<BR>
far sooner achieve final world peace using the dollar rather than
<BR>
using the missile.
<BR>
<P>The problem is, this is currently working against the U.S.
<BR>
We need to figure out a way to make mil-tech less profitable
<BR>
than commercial development in *other* countries.
