<P><EM> &gt; The answer is borganization, in which one or more intelligent people
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; get their heads together and think as a single entity of unified
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligence.  (Some cybernetics are probably required, but certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; not the clunky stuff you saw on Star Trek.) 
</EM><BR>
<P>(I assume you've read Vernor Vinge's 'A Fire Upon The Deep.' If not,
<BR>
it's a particularly interesting / entertaining exploration of the type
<BR>
of composite consciousness you describe. )
<BR>
<P>How much new sophistication would we need to start playing with these
<BR>
ideas? We can build tiny electric stimulators. We can build tiny,
<BR>
sensitive, EMF meters. We can build tiny radio transceivers. One would
<BR>
think we could put the three together and build a smallish (micro,
<BR>
rather than nanoscale) brain implant. Two sets could be then
<BR>
engineered, each listening to a member of the other and firing when
<BR>
its counterpart detects some threshold signal.
<BR>
<P>I imagine an experiment with two infant chimps: you inject maybe 500
<BR>
or 1000 such devices to corresponding sites scattered around the
<BR>
visual, motor, etc, areas. Don't do any sophisticated wiring - just
<BR>
let them sit, acting on medium-scale neural groups, and see what
<BR>
happens. Do the chimps just go into seizure, do their brains learn to
<BR>
ignore the affected groups, or are the self-organizing properties of
<BR>
the developing brain powerful enough that something interesting
<BR>
happens?  (Has someone already written this story?)
<BR>
<P>Anyway - the general idea you raise is attractive. I'm sick of being
<BR>
the sole generator of my own thoughts, stuck listening to the same
<BR>
stack of patterns all day. Being locked behind a single pair of eyes
<BR>
is claustrophobic, and squeezing one's inner life through inadequate
<BR>
language skills feels like dropping message bottles off a desert
<BR>
island. I can't imagine what poor eye-sight must have been like before
<BR>
glasses. Maybe one day we'll look back at existential loneliness the
<BR>
same way.
