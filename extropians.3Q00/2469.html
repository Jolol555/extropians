<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So let me get this straight: the resistant bacteria are present in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; MEAT? If that is the case, then the reason there are resistant strains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of bacteria is because the cows are not given ENOUGH anti-biotics to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wipe out the bacteria, so the claims of the greens are not only bogus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they are completely the opposite of what the proper solution is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, I don't know quite how to reply to this, or even if I should, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since I've had a very personal experience with antibiotic resistant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bacteria, I guess I'll give it a shot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Resistant bacteria are not killed by the antibiotic they're resistant to,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if you give them a large dose.  I almost died from bilateral bacterial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pneumonia, because the bacteria were resistant to the antibiotics I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given. I assure you I didn't stop taking the antibiotics.  They simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't work. The disease just kept running its course as though I hadn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taken antibiotics at all. At the hospital they gave me different antibiotics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which still didn't work. Far as I could tell, I got well on my immune system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone, although it certainly helped to have the oxygen and glucose IV's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess you didn't read what I said. I understand what you are saying.
<BR>
My own father has had repeat battles with a blood infection that swelled
<BR>
up his legs like elephantiasis, and they had to bring out what his doc
<BR>
calls 'the big guns' to finally whip it. What I was saying though, is
<BR>
that if there were resistant strains in the meat, then those strains got
<BR>
resistant due to an incomplete or insufficient treatment of antibiotics
<BR>
IN THE COW (NOT you). So the point is, it suggests the farmer is not
<BR>
giving the cow a sufficient dose of anti-biotics to wipe out the
<BR>
bacteria, NOT that its wrong he's giving them it at all.
