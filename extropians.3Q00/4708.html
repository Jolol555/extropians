<EM>&gt;I wish that this wasn't the case because I'm not particularly excited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about the prospect of living in Los Angeles.  For those of you who've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been to Vancouver, you'll recognize it as an incredible city-- in many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ways(in my not so objective opinion,) one of the finest cities on the planet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Joel,
<BR>
<P>After living (11 years) in that underwater, crime-infested, depressing
<BR>
twilight known as Vancouver, I loved L.A.'s sunshine and creative energy.
<BR>
In Vancouver, my 8-mile morning commute (from Kits Beach to North Van) took
<BR>
40 minutes to an hour. (At least in L.A. all the bad drivers are dead.)
<BR>
<P>Vancouver's February is known as 'Suicide Month.' The Pacific Northwest has
<BR>
the highest violent crime rate against women and children in North America.
<BR>
(I believe it's some sort of damp-induced brain fungus that impairs IQ and
<BR>
provokes rage.)
<BR>
<P>I noticed a vast difference btwn Canadian, (esp West Coast Cdn) and US (esp
<BR>
Californian) personal ethics and business practices - eg. the Vancouver
<BR>
stock exchange is an insider joke. My best adivce is to do business only
<BR>
with enitites solid enough to sue.
<BR>
<P>You'll perhaps miss Vancouver's male to female ratio (something like 11:1)
<BR>
which has given it a reputation as a 'bachelor's' paradise. I do miss
<BR>
Vancouver's ethnic restaurants. Oh, and that rare sunny day in October when
<BR>
the number of tourists has dwindled and an ocean breeze makes its way
<BR>
around the island to sweep the yellow haze all the way to Surrey.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm a -little- bit afraid of who I might become once I move there - I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hoping to do &gt;some good fortification to my personality before I make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jump.
</EM><BR>
<P>Care to share your tactics?
<BR>
