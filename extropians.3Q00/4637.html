<EM>&gt;.&gt; Personally, if the man was lied to, then the woman should either be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; forced to either abort, OR accept the father's dissolution of rights and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support. That is a perfectly fair reproductive choice to make.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't think every unplanned pregnancy was because &quot;the man was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lied to&quot; by the woman. I find it peculiar that you would explain away two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consenting adults with such a devious explanation. (I doubt that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  situations are due to such Jerry Springer antics)The two parties both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;participated in the risk,(and everyone does know the risks, both man and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;woman) There are many reasons that an unwanted pregnancy could result.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, I don't believe it would be fair to force an abortion on a woman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(physical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and emotional trauma) and I highly doubt that abortions will ever be forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on anyone (excluding medical emergency, which still isn't forced). Legally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that's just not going to take. Your other 'alternative/choice&quot; is that if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;woman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;refuses abortion, that she should then take care of the child, (who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his as well) while he shouldn't have to contribute emotional or financial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsibility.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Of course, I'm sure this is gonna piss off at least a few of the women on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the list. I personally think that the lack of application of consent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; here is a major legal hole.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Funny you should say that (about to puke) your reasonable (in pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jest) 'resolution' of such a situation is shockingly selfish, not only in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leaving all consequences on the female of the -two- who took the risk,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but for the child as well. It's as if your scenario implies she had sex 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;herself. (I smell cop out)
</EM><BR>

<P>But....  There isn't any &quot;child&quot; at the point of conception.  There's just 
<BR>
an embryo, which, if it gets a huge amount of biosupport for 9 months, might 
<BR>
eventually make it to the point of being a child.  The point at which one 
<BR>
can talk about a child is certainly uncertain at our current state of 
<BR>
understanding of the scientific/medical/ethical issues, screwed up as they 
<BR>
are by all the religious nonsense and propaganda, but I can state with great 
<BR>
certainty that it doesn't qualify as a child at conception, nor at one week, 
<BR>
nor at one month, nor at three months.  After that, the level of certainly 
<BR>
starts dropping.
<BR>
<P>Thus, the mere act of co-creating an embryo is not all the same as that of 
<BR>
having a child.  The option of having a child or not is purely up to the 
<BR>
woman.  Since it is totally her choice, then it is totally invalid to try to 
<BR>
bill the man for the consequences of HER choice.  Only if the man agreed at 
<BR>
the beginning that if the woman chose to have a child, then he would take 
<BR>
responsibility for support, would the man be liable.
<BR>
<P>Most embryos don't make it to being a child, BTW.  I've read that about 75% 
<BR>
of human embryos die naturally due to histoincompatibilities and other 
<BR>
problems.  Dogs have about the same rate, probably because they also have 
<BR>
gone thru a period of very rapid evolution, as well.  Usually they are 
<BR>
simply reabsorbed during the first few weeks of prenancy.  (So, for the 
<BR>
Christians reading this, does this mean that God made a MISTAKE!  Or could 
<BR>
it be that He doesn't really care very much about embryos.)
<BR>
<P>If women did not have a reasonable option of choice due to legal or medical 
<BR>
problems, as would have been the case 50 years ago in this country, then you 
<BR>
could make a different argument, certainly.  But one of the basic principles 
<BR>
of justice is that all parties are expected to act reasonably.  Just because 
<BR>
some drunk drops a lighted cigar on your carpet and then passes out in front 
<BR>
of you does not give you the option of letting the house burn down and then 
<BR>
charging the drunk.  If you could have limited the damage due to someone 
<BR>
else's error and you chose not to, then you can only charge them for the 
<BR>
damage that would have occurred had you intervened.
<BR>
<P>Thus, today, given the woman's options, the most a woman could dunn the man 
<BR>
for is half the cost of an abortion, assuming no prior contract otherwise.  
<BR>
If it is rational for the man to assume that the woman is using birth 
<BR>
control, and she isn't, then he can't be held responsible at all.
<BR>
<P>A confusion arises here out of a confusion of two separate lines of 
<BR>
argument.  One has to do with the responsibility for the costs of raising a 
<BR>
child between the man and woman.  The other has to do with the 
<BR>
&quot;responsibility&quot; for the child to begin with.  Clearly, in a causational 
<BR>
sense, the man and woman are responsible, although, as I point out above, 
<BR>
the woman has the ultimate veto and thus bears the only real responsibility 
<BR>
barring prior contract.
<BR>
<P>However, no person is &quot;responsible&quot; in the sense of &quot;liable for the support 
<BR>
of&quot; another person.  Life itself is the ultimate gift.  If, at the point of 
<BR>
birth, the mother changes her mind, for whatever reason, there is no moral 
<BR>
basis as such for claiming that she must support the child for one second 
<BR>
beyond that point.  At that point, anyone else is certainly free to claim 
<BR>
surrogate parent rights, and, in a normal society where children are highly 
<BR>
valued - such as our own, where tens of thousands of childless couples 
<BR>
desperately seek children denied them by a thoroughly evil social services 
<BR>
bureacracy - there would be no lack of takers for all but the most severely 
<BR>
defective children.
<BR>
<P>I would be appalled by any mother who simply abandoned a child without 
<BR>
searching for alternate support, just as I would be appalled by someone who 
<BR>
witnessed a serious accident on the freeway and failed to at least call it 
<BR>
in on their cellphone.  Nonetheless, this idea that simply having born a 
<BR>
child makes one liable for the support of that person for the next 18 or 21 
<BR>
or whatever number of arbitrary years, is morally absurd.  And, if it is 
<BR>
morally absurd for the mother, it is most certainly morally absurd for the 
<BR>
father - again barring prior contract.
