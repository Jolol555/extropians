<EM>&gt; &gt; Species don't obviously, evolve in the blink of an eye to occupy an empty niche.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Typically one from a neighboring niche expands into it then begins to breed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the optimum for that niche, unless being multi-niche capable is an evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; advantage. As an example, I can bring up predators in New England. Cougars have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not been seen in New England for more than 100-150 years (or, for that matter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anywhere north of Virginia).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A minor point, but there is one or more cougars/mountain lions in the Delaware,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pennsylvania, New Jersey tri state area for the past 3 years.  Tracks and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sitings have been occuring, with much disbelief, until someone caught it on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; video tape near an elementary school.
</EM><BR>
<P>The same thing has been happening in New England the last 5-10 years, someone
<BR>
caught the tail end of one on video last summer. IMHO they've been migrating up
<BR>
the Appalachians from Florida over the last 40 years as development has been
<BR>
causing pressure down there...Floridians have been decrying the decreasing
<BR>
population down there, when they actually are not dying off, just moving out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sometimes wonder about some of the odd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things Brin's transparent society cameras would capture.  Rats, bears, cougars, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wildlife in the suburbs.  Could be the basis for a new reality TV series:-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I would have loved to have caught on camera this bear that tried to eat its way
<BR>
through the wall at a corner of my cabin, where the kitchen is (my older brother
<BR>
had left a small bag of dogfood sitting in that corner, which the bear obviously
<BR>
smelled.)
<BR>
<P>You can actually buy game cameras through Cabelas and other hunting supply
<BR>
outlets, as well as IR systems that you can place on game trails to create
<BR>
databases of the frequency that they are used, as well as date and time info.
