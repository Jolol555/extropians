<P>Scott I did see that program but I ha' me doots about some
<BR>
of the information.  Perhaps a little too strong on the symmetry
<BR>
aspects of beauty.  Consider the babe Shannen Doherty, pics
<BR>
given below.

<P><A HREF="http://www.shannen-doherty.simplenet.com/pics.htm">http://www.shannen-doherty.simplenet.com/pics.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Theres an example of attractive yet definitely non-
<BR>
symmetrical face.  One of her eyes is noticeably higher
<BR>
than the other.  That syndrome has a name, I just cannot
<BR>
recall what it is.  Anyone?
<BR>
<P>Thought experiment:  Choose photos randomly of 100 women,
<BR>
all aged about 30, dressed similarly in beach attire, faces fuzzed.
<BR>
Have a group of randomly chosen men select their 10 faves.
<BR>
Calculate the body mass index of the highest vote getters.  I
<BR>
suspect they would fall in the 20th percentile range in BMI.
<BR>
<P>Repeat experiment with 100 men, all dressed similarly,
<BR>
have ladies choose.  I suspect the top vote getters would
<BR>
be much more toward 50th percentile BMI.
<BR>
<P>My notion is that regardless of what messages Madison
<BR>
Ave crams down our throats, some mechanism has caused
<BR>
men to be born hard-wired with a preference for thinner
<BR>
women, a preference not so clear in women.
<BR>
<P>Of course, the women get the last laugh at society's
<BR>
apparent cruelty in urging them to go thru life 10-20 kg
<BR>
below their natural weight: by a lifetime of struggling
<BR>
and obsessing about a few extra kg of flab, the ladies
<BR>
eat less than us ugly old boys, and as a result the
<BR>
caloric restriction causes women to live several years
<BR>
longer than their male counterparts.
<BR>
<P>Or perhaps the last laugh is with those few lucky men
<BR>
who survive to reach the convalescent home to find that
<BR>
there are now 5 women his age for every man.  But then
<BR>
again, tho he devours viagra he cannot do a damn thing
<BR>
about any of them.  I guess its all how one looks at the
<BR>
problem, which is to say light-heartedly I hope.  spike
