<EM>&gt;     As a young man I worked my way through engineering partially by carry a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; .38 and investigating burgular alarms that were sounding off.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like dangerous work!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something I sense you are overlooking.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     There are many criminals that will attempt to take your weapon if they do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not believe you will use it.  The weapon is worth a fair amount of money on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the street and the macho value of having taken it from you is also rather 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you have to worry about this, and would it have made you hesitant
<BR>
to show your gun?  (Did you ever actually run into a bad situation?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     There are also criminals that will attack you if you if you pull a gun 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they simply do not believe you will shoot them.  For that reason I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also carried a nightstick because those same idiots always seemed to believe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would brain them.  In my view carrying the stick was a small price to pay 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it bought me peace while I was doing my job.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm confused; did you carry the nightstick in addition to the .38?
<BR>
Did you brandish both, or did you decide depending on the situation
<BR>
whether to use the gun or the stick?
<BR>
<P>It's interesting that the bad guys would find it more believable that you
<BR>
would use the stick and in some ways be more intimidated by that weapon.
<BR>
It makes sense though, because the gun is a much more binary weapon
<BR>
(life or death) and doesn't allow for the degree of control that a stick
<BR>
or club would.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     In summary what I am saying is that if you decide to carry a gun, as you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a right to do, then think it all through ahead of time; otherwise you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could either get badly hurt or be pushed into doing something you would be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unwilling to do after reflection.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly sounds like good advice.
<BR>
<P>Hal
