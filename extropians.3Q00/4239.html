<EM>&gt; Driving along the freeway on many of these 106 degree (that's 50, for you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; progressives), cloudless days, I can't help but be struck by the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; direction we should be going, which is solar energy in the most direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion.  So how are we doing?  Can someone point me to good resources to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quickly get up to speed on the state of the art in direct photovoltaic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology and the rate of progress in that field?  How close are we to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical industrial-scale photovoltaics?
</EM><BR>
<P>When I was in Seattle, a freind of mine was president of US Solar Power, and
<BR>
they were in a development project with the Dept of Energy and a couple other
<BR>
companies to develop flexible amorphous silicon PV roofins shingles. The plan
<BR>
was to produce these at industrial rates, which would allow the per kWh cost of
<BR>
these units to drop to about $0.12 per kWh, which is considered the best
<BR>
acheived to date. I lost touch with this project, and I don't know what the
<BR>
status is currently. Supposedly they had a demonstrator house built in 1995, but
<BR>
I never saw it, and since the GOP cut off most Energy Dept funding for
<BR>
conservation in 1994, I don't know if any funding has increased since.
<BR>
Conservation programs tend to drift toward the least cost source of conserved
<BR>
energy. When I was in the business, they were buying cogeneration, lighting and
<BR>
heating conservation energy at a rate of 1-2 cents per kWh, which is one tenth
<BR>
the cost of the solar shingles I mentioned. Since the end of the Cold War, start
<BR>
up utility companies have been buying converted jet engines to run on natural
<BR>
gas to generate power and heat
<BR>
<P>Practical industrial scale photovolatics? Well, what technology are you talking
<BR>
about? There are essentially five solar technologies to consider:
<BR>
<P>PV:	type					efficiency
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- amorphous silicon			10%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- monolithic silicon			12-20%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- gallium arsenide			20-33%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- gallium arsenide/gallium antimonide	33-36% (theo. max. for PV)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- solar thermal generation		50-80%
<BR>
<P>amorphous silicon is the lest expensive to manufacture, on both a per cell and a
<BR>
per kWh basis. GaAs/GaAnt cells are extremely expensive cells, and are only cost
<BR>
effective really in satellites, although Krystal Power in Issaquah, WA was
<BR>
working on a Natural Gas generator that used GaAs/GaAnt cells to generate power
<BR>
from the combusion flames several years ago.
<BR>
<P>There have been solar thermal generation systems developed, most notably one in
<BR>
southern CA that I believe is now offline due to age and operating expense.
<BR>
<P>The main downside to solar technology is that its not always sunny wherever your
<BR>
generator is. While the southwestern US does have a nice reliable number of
<BR>
sunny days per year to count on, the rest of the country does not. The Sahara
<BR>
desert is an excellent place for a major solar generation system, while
<BR>
sub-saharan africa is not. The few sunny days you have, the less cost effective
<BR>
it is to use solar power. Utilities in the western US only pay for the
<BR>
installation of solar systems in homes that are too remote to run grid power
<BR>
cost effectively. If Lake Powell and other western hydro dams are drained,
<BR>
though, I think you will see this situation change, which may be the real reason
<BR>
why the Sierra Club has been lobbying for that for several years.
<BR>
<P>The main restraint against ANY alternative/renewable energy generation system is
<BR>
capital costs and the capital market.  Renewables are extremely capital
<BR>
intensive projects (70% of per kWh cost), while they cost little, usually, in
<BR>
terms of operating costs. Fossil fuel generation, on the other hand, is cheap
<BR>
capital wise, while 70% or more of the per kWh cost is due to operating expenses
<BR>
(fuel, maint, labor, etc...). In any economy where interest rates are rising or
<BR>
are high, construction of renewables is not a cost effective solution. The need
<BR>
for interest rates in the sub 4% range to achieve cost effectiveness typically
<BR>
requires that these renewable projects either be owned by or subsidized by
<BR>
government lending, which obviously commands the lowest interest rates.
<BR>
<P>The other big restraint is the NIMBY attitude. Environmentalists want us to all
<BR>
use solar power, but they don't want those solar panels or windmills cluttering
<BR>
up the landscape view from their own homes or on their own commute routes...
