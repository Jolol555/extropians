<BR>
<P><P>FOR years, polystyrene foam has been keeping our coffee hot and our beer
<BR>
cold. Now chemists have taught single molecules of this plastic a more
<BR>
impressive trick--how to snatch and store energy from light in the way that
<BR>
plants do. 
<BR>
The researchers, based as the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico,
<BR>
are aiming to build a new breed of cheap polystyrene-based batteries. They
<BR>
say the batteries could be used to provide power for anything from cars to
<BR>
cellphones. 
<BR>
The project is part of continuing efforts by Tom Meyer and his colleagues
<BR>
at Los Alamos to find simple materials that can mimic the complex chemistry
<BR>
of photosynthesis, which allows plants to store energy from sunlight in
<BR>
chemical bonds. 
<BR>
<P>The first step in photosynthesis is the absorption of a photon--a particle
<BR>
of light--by an &quot;antenna&quot; composed of the green pigment chlorophyll. This
<BR>
energy is then used to propel electrons around the chemical bonds of the
<BR>
molecules involved in the reaction, ultimately stripping electrons from
<BR>
water to make oxygen, and adding them to carbon dioxide to create
<BR>
energy-rich sugars. 
<BR>
Meyer's team had already managed to recreate each of these steps
<BR>
separately, using different synthetic molecules that work in conjunction
<BR>
with an atom of the metal ruthenium. In his latest experiments, he decided
<BR>
to link these molecules on a polymer backbone. &quot;Because polystyrene
<BR>
polymers are so widely used, their chemistry is very well understood,&quot; he
<BR>
says. &quot;So it was an obvious choice for the backbone.&quot; 
<BR>
To test out the new molecule, the researchers zapped a solution of it with
<BR>
a laser. As they had hoped, some side chains containing the ruthenium
<BR>
antennas were able to absorb the light energy and pass it along the polymer
<BR>
chain. When the energy reached another type of ruthenium complex, it was
<BR>
able to do some chemical work, pushing an electron to a different part of
<BR>
the complex. Mobilising electrons in this way is what batteries
<BR>
do--supplying electrons from an anode that can be drawn around a circuit
<BR>
and back towards its cathode. 
<BR>
Michael Wasielewski, a photosynthetic chemist at Northwestern University in
<BR>
Chicago, thinks Meyer's choice of polymer was the key. &quot;All the right
<BR>
properties are there,&quot; he says. &quot;And we already have robust [manufacturing]
<BR>
technology to work with polystyrene. It's a nice piece of work.&quot; 
<BR>
Because polystyrene derivatives are inexpensive to create, Meyer thinks his
<BR>
polymer holds great promise for a wide array of devices--such as
<BR>
solar-powered fuel cells that pull electrons from water to create hydrogen
<BR>
fuel or to generate an electric current. 
<BR>
For now, his team's main aim is to increase the efficiency with which the
<BR>
molecules convert energy, which is now hovering around 15 per cent.
<BR>
&quot;There's a lot of hard work ahead, but you have to expect that,&quot; he says.
<BR>
&quot;After all, it took natural photosynthesis more than a billion years to
<BR>
evolve.&quot;
