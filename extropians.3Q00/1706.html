<EM>&gt; &gt; Well if this is your goal, declaring you are willing to be uploaded at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 10% chance of success is clearly the wrong strategy.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Instead you should just get rich and wait.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is probably where there's a conflict with singularity/no singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scenarios. I see mega-copied uploads as a recipe for singularity, esp. if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you've uploaded people savvy about their upload environment (admittedly this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is not likely for a cryonaut). So I think getting rich &amp; waiting is likely a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;path to failure in this endeavour; it doesn't matter how much money you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;got, it'll still be (in a singularity scenario) the first uploads who decide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if you get to come on board, or are fed to the carnobots.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In a non-singularity environment, of course you are correct; it's better to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wait until the kinks are ironed out, then get uploaded into MS Upload v27. ...
</EM><BR>
<P>As you may have noticed, the term &quot;singularity&quot; is used many different ways.
<BR>
But it seems you think that there is more than a 90% chance that the first
<BR>
uploads would kill you.  Is that because you are special, or do you think &gt;90%
<BR>
of everyone would be killed?  Do you expect that because that is what you 
<BR>
would
<BR>
do if you succeeded in being one of the first?!  Think carefully; I may 
<BR>
have to
<BR>
start the &quot;Anyone but Emlyn&quot; faction.  :-)
