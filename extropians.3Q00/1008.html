<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, it's not quite that simple (laws never are, and IP laws are much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worse).  &quot;Public performance&quot; can be an infringement, and charging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; money or not is not the deciding factor.  A court decides on a case-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by-case basis.  Playing an album at your party is probably okay, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if you charged for entrance.  But waiters singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; customers is not--that has been ruled an infringement of the copyright
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to that song owned by the estate of the Smith sisters, who zealously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pursue such infringements of the copyright--no doubt to encourage the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; production of more creative work by their dead ancestors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah, but waiters are engaging in a dinnerlong performance for compensation:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their tips.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's one possible interpretation, and perhaps that argument could be
<BR>
made in a civil copyright action.  But the fact remains that copyrights
<BR>
are now embodied in federal /criminal/ law, and are no longer merely
<BR>
torts.  They are crimes, and can be prosecuted as such totally in the
<BR>
absence of any tortious harm.  Whether or not you make money from an
<BR>
infringing use is /one/ factor a court is expected to consider in judging
<BR>
&quot;fair use&quot;, but that's an affirmative defense, where the burden is on
<BR>
the defendant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you think &quot;I'm not making money&quot; is an excuse, put up a fan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; website for a popular movie or TV show and see what happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where such websites get nailed is the unauthorized use of trademarks, logos,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. which do not depend upon money changing hands to be protectable..
</EM><BR>
<P>That's one way they get in trouble, yes.  But sites with transcripts of
<BR>
the shows, for example, and no trademarks have been shut down as well.
<BR>
<P>You absolutely /can/ be prosecuted for copyright infringement for uses
<BR>
that do not involve compensation.  This has been done, successfully,
<BR>
and will continue to be done.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
