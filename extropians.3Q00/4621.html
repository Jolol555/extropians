<P><EM>&gt; Hey Spike is it true that the shortage of housing there is really caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by anti-growth laws that prevent a lot of development?
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true methinks.  Makes sense, does it not?  Are not elections
<BR>
controlled by landowners?  Do not landowners have a vested interest
<BR>
in limiting the total amount of that asset which they already own?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I just don't understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why on one hand you've got a housing shortage, and on the other hand there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't buttloads of high rise condos going up? It seems awfully artificial.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, intentional and artificial.  Do you suppose any landowner wants
<BR>
low cost housing anywhere near her back yard?  Nyet, she wants
<BR>
*unaffordable* housing across the street, high cost housing to
<BR>
replace low cost housing.  As it turns out, this is exactly what
<BR>
has happened, without any actual physical changes occurring
<BR>
to the structures themselves.  The rich young technocrats have
<BR>
displaced many long-time valley residents, and the property
<BR>
values responded as you might expect.
<BR>
<P>I have mixed feelings about it.  We will lose a lot of low cost
<BR>
services, yet on the other hand, the neighborhoods get a lot
<BR>
safer, and in many ways more interesting to live in.  Extropian
<BR>
notions are common in a technocrat neighborhood, for instance.
