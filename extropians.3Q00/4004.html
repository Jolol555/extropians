<EM>&gt;Subject: John Stossel special re-airing tonight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Fri, 01 Sep 2000 12:21:53 CDT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There's a John Stossel special re-airing tonight, on ABC at 10:00PM EST.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's titled &quot;Is America #1?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For anyone not familiar with Stossel's specials, I've found they're a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way to introduce people to ideas of liberty.  Toward that end, probably the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;best thing on TV since Milton Friedman's &quot;Free to Choose&quot; series in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;70s,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;IMHO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am watching this now. I have always liked Stossel's mindset. However, this 
<BR>
is in large part (at least so far), pro-business propanganda.
<BR>
I do agree there are some great points about bureaucracy. Yes, it is 
<BR>
stifling.
<BR>
<P>But this libertarian viewpoint misses part of the big picture.
<BR>
As always, business media has taken the most salient and obvious points and 
<BR>
pushed them to the forefront.
<BR>
What they don't mention is that immigrants come here because *capital* is 
<BR>
here, and that is where the work is. The capital is here in large part 
<BR>
because of the stability of America. Yes, less paperwork helps. But that is 
<BR>
only part of the story.
<BR>
<P>Also, if you looked carefully when the immigrants were shown being sworn in, 
<BR>
you could see that *most* the new immigrants were *old*, and if *was* their 
<BR>
own retirement  *they* were thinking of, I assure you, a retirement paid for 
<BR>
by tax dollars *they* never paid.
<BR>
<P>People thinking of their retirement are mocked. Again and again I see the 
<BR>
face of propaganda the likes of which I have not seen since the good old 
<BR>
days--buy some war bonds, anyone?
<BR>
<P>But I have only to look at the cold numbers: the capital workplace is 
<BR>
inherently *competitive*: by virtue of the nature of competition, some will 
<BR>
succeed, and some will fail. There is a premium on being in the upper half. 
<BR>
But no matter how hard you work, half will be in the bottom, and half will 
<BR>
be in the top.
<BR>
<P>He is talking now of the new jobs, and how much easier they are than the old 
<BR>
steel mill jobs, but the old guy talking about it no doubt bought his home 
<BR>
from the steel mill money.
<BR>
<P>Yes, AMerica is the best for poor people who want to escape poverty. And it 
<BR>
would be even better for them if those poor people could find or tyes even 
<BR>
steal, a million dollars, But those kinds of windfalls are hard to come by, 
<BR>
but they can, however, low bid for jobs in America, are thereby benefit from 
<BR>
the capital that generates jobs here, even though that capital is here 
<BR>
because we AMericans built this country as one in which capital could be 
<BR>
safe, and the old immigrants can find a retirement. Will, that's great for 
<BR>
them, but what does it do for me?
<BR>
<P>There is much more to this area, but I must compete, yes, even on a Friday 
<BR>
night, there are API's to learn, etc.
<BR>
<P>And yes, as a person who hopes to benefit from the future power of medical 
<BR>
science, cutthroat capitalism is best, so I will stand by,  though not 
<BR>
without protest, for I am a natural contrarian and sardonic observer. 
<BR>
Whenever I am in a room where everyone is ignoring the pink elephant, I 
<BR>
cannot help but point it out.
