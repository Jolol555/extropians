<EM>&gt; &gt; should tell you that when every instance where communist societies were

<EM>&gt; &gt; attempted the result was militaristic oppressive totalitarian regiemes,

<EM>&gt; then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 'communism' you claim to be 'true' communism is nothing but a chimera, a

<EM>&gt; Mike, I've heard you claim the same thing about capitalism; that you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go on past implementations, because they've never faithfully realised the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capitalist dream. Doesn't this same logic then imply that a pure free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market, like a pure communist society, has credibility up there with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tooth fairy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if you ignore the failure modes. Communism tends to fail into totalitarian
<BR>
oppression that kills 20-40 million people and enslaves the rest under terror
<BR>
tactics of secret police that keeps 10-20 million people in jail at any given
<BR>
time (for a US sized country), and where technological advancement stagnates,
<BR>
infrastructure crumbles, average life expectancy and standards of living
<BR>
plummet, and the leadership is only interested in taking bribes and gutting the
<BR>
system for the own personal aggrandizement.
<BR>
<P>Capitalists have never:
<BR>
<P>a) operated concentration camps
<BR>
b) exterminated people they refused to do business with
<BR>
c) exterminated anyone who looked at or talked badly about the bosses
<BR>
d) waged war against people
<BR>
etc etc etc
<BR>
<P>The facts are that 'perfect' communism was TRIED to be enacted, but failed
<BR>
miserably, several times. 
<BR>
<P>You also misrepresent what I've said. I never said that capitalism has never
<BR>
been realized. On the contrary, it has occured at several periods in history,
<BR>
with little or no government. David Friedman has written at length about two
<BR>
periods in particular: medieval Iceland and the Law Merchant period, and the
<BR>
pre-civil war period in the US as well. What I have said is that the US is not
<BR>
now a capitalist system, but is a mercantilist/socialist amalgamation, and that
<BR>
this is mostly due to a failure of our civil justice system in the late 1800's
<BR>
to properly deal with negative externalities.
