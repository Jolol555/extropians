<EM>&gt; &gt; ... given the statistics of risk of being killed during a rape, robbery, etc,

<EM>&gt; &gt; there is a significant probability of deadly harm in such events, and given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that its been proven that you are at least 30% more likely to survive such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; crime if you are armed with a gun, then not carrying one is simply stupid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I checked US crime statistics at <A HREF="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm">http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</A>,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I find that in the most recent year shown, 1998:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Violent Crimes:   1,531,044
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Murder:              16,914
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only 1% of all violent crimes lead to murder.  Also, I believe I've read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elsewhere that a substantial fraction of murders do not occur in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; context of a robbery, but rather are crimes of passion committed by people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who know the victim.  This would further lower the chances that a mugging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or similar violent encounter with a criminal could lead to your death.
</EM><BR>
<P>The claim that 'killer knows the victim' is a false claim. The FBI statistics of
<BR>
the 'victim knowing their assailant' are based upon the fact that someone you
<BR>
know in your neighborhood or community is considered an 'acquaintance'. The drug
<BR>
dealer that hangs out on your corner may not be your freind, buddy, or
<BR>
significant other, but they are, as far as the FBI is concerned, your
<BR>
'acquaintance'. An assailant may be far more acquaintend with you than you are
<BR>
with them for the simple fact that many criminals case out their targets.
<BR>
Whether its a stalker, a robber, a rapist, or a muderer, assailants do typically
<BR>
know many facts about their targets merely as a matter of the predator
<BR>
researching his prey. It does not mean that they were in any way on freindly
<BR>
terms of any kind or relationship.
<BR>
<P>Moreover, as I have already told you several times, but you seem to be pointedly
<BR>
ignoring, is you have no idea which type of crime YOU are going to be a victim
<BR>
of. Hoping for the best possible outcome from the worst sort of person is
<BR>
polyannish and stupid thinking.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If you're prepared to kill in response to robberies and other violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crimes against yourself (as I believe Mike and others advocate) then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must accept that there is a 99% chance that you are NOT defending your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life, you are rather applying the death penalty to a sub-lethal crime.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly, however, someone who is less likely to want to kill me is also more
<BR>
likely to either flee or surrender, whereas the determined murderer is not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am curious, do people who advocate using guns against robbers also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support the death penalty?  And would they support expanding the range
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of crimes which deserve death, since they are personally willing to kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in response to sub-lethal crimes?  Would they even go to the point that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they would support the death penalty for robbery?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, as it is currently adjudicated I don't support it, because the stats
<BR>
don't show it having any impact on crime rates, and the frequency with which
<BR>
innocent men have been convicted demands past convictions be reviewed and
<BR>
evidence tested. With DNA testing, though, I think that capital cases should be
<BR>
speeded up greatly, with fewer appeals, in cases where there is corroborating
<BR>
evidence for each category of means, motive, and opportunity. Cases with a dozen
<BR>
eye witnesses and a corroborating chain of evidence that links the suspect to
<BR>
the weapon to the victim should not be able to appeal on technicalities.
<BR>
Currently only a small percentage of murderers ever get the death penalty, or
<BR>
are even convicted for that matter. Making justice surer and swifter will have a
<BR>
deterrent effect that is closer to that shown by civilians carring their own
<BR>
weapons.
