<BR>
<P>(Comments on Napster and Gnutella.)
<BR>
<P>Regarding all the hula around Napster and Gnutella, there are a lot of myths
<BR>
and misunderstandings. I find that this is because most people don't really
<BR>
understand what is going on. As a long time music fan, musician, programmer
<BR>
and employee in the advertising business I probably have a somewhat more
<BR>
rounded view of the whole affair.
<BR>
<P>It is as though writing music and software is considered to be one and the
<BR>
same thing. Well it is not!
<BR>
<P>Software writers can make free software because they have a core business
<BR>
they make money on. Thus the free software is a tool to them like a hammer
<BR>
is to a carpenter. They loose money on the hammer but they make money
<BR>
working with the hammer. The customer pays for it all.
<BR>
<P>Musicians make music. The customers pays. Or else they don't make money.
<BR>
Simple as that.
<BR>
<P>85% of all music ever recorded has never made enough money to recover the
<BR>
production cost. So probably all the free music on the net will have no
<BR>
effects on most musicians. The problem is that it is the best musicians that
<BR>
gets the problems. Those that actually sell their music and make a living.
<BR>
<P>If no one pays for music, the quality will drop dramatically.
<BR>
<P>The way the music industry works right now is like this: A new artist is
<BR>
discovered and gets a record deal. The record company then assigns an
<BR>
experienced producer to raise the quality of the music. This process is what
<BR>
makes high quality music. Experience combined with fresh ideas. When there
<BR>
is no money to pay a producer we will only have fresh ideas. Try listening
<BR>
to the music on mp3.com for that. It's demo quality at best. Not the kind of
<BR>
music I want to spend the rest of my life listening to.
<BR>
<P>But what about other business models?
<BR>
<P>Why don't musicians make a living selling T-Shirts, playing concerts getting
<BR>
famous and appearing in adds, tv-shows etc.
<BR>
<P>Yeah and why we are on it why not just get a &quot;mcJob&quot; and make music in your
<BR>
spare time? Actually this is what most people do. And that is ok. There is
<BR>
only so much talent to go around, and not everybody should make a living
<BR>
making music. But to say that no one should?
<BR>
<P>Good musicians need to dedicate a lifetime producing and playing music to
<BR>
get to be really good at it. Why on earth should a talented musician waste
<BR>
his time printing t-shirts? Why should other people decide that a musician
<BR>
must make a living by doing other stuff than making music? Just because
<BR>
music CAN be distributed for free doesn't mean that it should.
<BR>
<P>There is a practical side to music distribution as well as an ethical side.
<BR>
<P>Ethically distributing music for free is like saying that it is ok to walk
<BR>
into an unlocked house and steal all the money found there. And furthermore
<BR>
it is like having all the thieves make doors without locks and then
<BR>
installing them in peoples houses, without the inhabitants being able to do
<BR>
anything about it.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well money is not like music, when somebody steals it it is gone. With
<BR>
music you can just make a digital copy and no one has lost anything.&quot;
<BR>
somebody might argue.
<BR>
<P>Yeah right! And if somebody steals your money you can make copies too. That
<BR>
should be as legal as stealing music. We are just more used to money having
<BR>
a value. That is the only difference between printed paper and music.
<BR>
<P>Off course freely distributed music has marketing value. But that only goes
<BR>
so far. At some time the marketing must stop and money must be earned.
<BR>
<P>For a musician music is like money. The more is is copied the less it is
<BR>
worth to the musician. There is fever people to sell it to. Napster,
<BR>
Gnutella etc. creates an inflation in the amount of music. Thus causing a
<BR>
deflation in the value of music.
<BR>
<P>This also means that music currently is worth less than it has been. And
<BR>
that is ok by me. I don't want to pay $15 either, for an album that I can
<BR>
get over the net for free.
<BR>
<P>The problem right now is that it is much simpler for me to find a song on
<BR>
Gnutella than it is to buy it online. Even if i wanted too, it is a pain to
<BR>
go to an online record store, find the song, dish up my credit card, pay for
<BR>
it and wait a week for it to arrive. After which I then must convert it to
<BR>
mp3 myself so that I can put it on my harddrive for listening convenience.
<BR>
<P>Besides I can't even order a single song to put on my HD. The record company
<BR>
and the artist decide what I can buy.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore I have never understood why a music album that cost maybe
<BR>
$1,000,000 to produce should cost as much as a $150,000,000 movie to buy.
<BR>
This can only be because distribution and marketing is the main part of the
<BR>
expense. That can be changed with net based distribution.
<BR>
<P>The fact that college kids with a computer can give me a better service than
<BR>
an international record company should make somebody stop and think. Perhaps
<BR>
the problem with Napster, Gnutella etc. is that you cannot easily pay for
<BR>
the music, and that the music you can pay for online or in stores is so much
<BR>
more expensive than necessary.
<BR>
<P>It is like somebody selling high priced bottled water next to the spring.
<BR>
&quot;But we have marketing and packaging expenses.&quot; Oh yes...
<BR>
<P>I would not mind paying for music downloaded over the net. But I am not
<BR>
willing to pay more than it is worth.
<BR>
<P>The funny thing is that mass production of a single work of art is what has
<BR>
made it possible in the past for musicians to get extremely rich. Now that
<BR>
mass production is so easy it might be what makes it impossible for a
<BR>
musician to be extremely rich.
<BR>
<P>But then again. I don't see that musicians has a birthright to get extremely
<BR>
rich, or even to the possibility to be extremely rich. It's not like it is a
<BR>
law of nature that if you have a hit single that you will never have to work
<BR>
again. Most people in the world never has an opportunity like that. Most of
<BR>
us work for wages all our lives. Being productive as long as possible. This
<BR>
is not to say that it might never happen in a world with cheap digital
<BR>
music. Nobody knows.
<BR>
<P>Maybe a system where you pay 10 cents for a song can make someone rich.
<BR>
Maybe it would even be possible for more musicians to make a living that
<BR>
way? If you can make 1 song a month and you want to make $3000 a month for a
<BR>
comfortable living, each song must sell 30.000 copies. At that price I
<BR>
believe that a LOT more music would be sold, so 30.000 copies would not be
<BR>
unreasonable for music of a certain quality, with a good distribution
<BR>
system. An album with 10 songs would cost $1. I would be willing to pay
<BR>
that. If only I was able to.
<BR>
<P>The problem with Gnutella, Napster etc. from my point of view is not one of
<BR>
intellectual copyright. That is a moot point when it cannot be upheld
<BR>
anyway. The problem is that the labels and artist are clinging on to their
<BR>
traditional business models. What the distributed systems gives is high
<BR>
service and low price. What they take away is the artist possibility to make
<BR>
a decent living.
<BR>
<P>I want something like <A HREF="http://www.imdb.com">http://www.imdb.com</A> just for music, where I can find
<BR>
out everything about artist, songs, genres etc. and buy the music cheap and
<BR>
without any hassle. Whether I have to subscribe or pay per download, I don't
<BR>
care. It just has to be as easy as possible and with lots of service.
<BR>
<P>mxm.
