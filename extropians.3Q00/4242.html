<P><P><EM>&gt; OK, I know why *we* would want AI to be friendly.  But why would the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AI want to be friendly to us?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, the ant idea has similarities but I'd bet the ants
<BR>
are more abstract non feeling automata with little if any ability to
<BR>
feel phenomenal consciousness.  Some day, hopefully we'll know just
<BR>
what it's like to be an ant, but I'd bet today that it's not much more
<BR>
than being like a computer.  And there is no problem with turning off
<BR>
and throwing away a computer since it can't feel.  So how about lets
<BR>
raise it up another level?  Lets say we were created by a pack of
<BR>
obviously feeling dogs (or any other being that has even a hint of
<BR>
conscious awareness and ability to feel joy, even if it does turn out
<BR>
to include something as low as Ants.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first things I think we should realize is dogs
<BR>
obviously have some phenomenaly unbelievably ability to &quot;smell&quot;.  I
<BR>
would think to myself, boy, look at the way they act toward various
<BR>
smells.  I would wonder what it is like and want them to eff smell to
<BR>
me so I too could experience such obviously glorious sensations.
<BR>
Obviously, since they careted me, they, with me helping perhaps, would
<BR>
eventually develop the ability for my brain to experience the same
<BR>
sensations of smell they experience.  I could finally say: &quot;Oh that's
<BR>
what that smell is like for you! Wow! no wonder you like to always go
<BR>
out for walks and experience such things so often!&quot;  Given the
<BR>
phenomenally glorious nature of my currently limited smell, I'd
<BR>
surmise that any enhancement would be infinitely valuable and joyful
<BR>
to me.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of course, since the dogs had given me the ability to
<BR>
have more visual qualia than the black and white they have, I'd want
<BR>
to return the favor and help them do the work required so that they
<BR>
too, could see color and know what it is like.  Would seeing the look
<BR>
of enjoyment in your pet or friend dog when they experience color for
<BR>
the first time be of absolutely no worth to you?  In other words, if
<BR>
my creators could create me, certainly they could enhance themselves
<BR>
to be at least equivalent to me and keep up with me!  I can't
<BR>
understand why so many people assume just the opposite of this.  We
<BR>
are machines too, Why can we not be enhanced just as easy as any other
<BR>
AI?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think I'd be on my merry way to see what there is to see in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world they had bestowed upon me.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would anyone ever completely abandon anyone or anything?
<BR>
Though we spend a very small percentage of thinking time thinking
<BR>
about and concerned over ants, mankind does spend some percentage of
<BR>
effort concerned about them.  Even if this percentage of our total
<BR>
effort decreased significantly, as we grew exponentially, there is no
<BR>
reason why the total amount of help on their behalf could still not
<BR>
increase along with everything else.  .1% of a billion is a lot more
<BR>
more than 1% of 10 right!?  Along with all the studying of ants we do,
<BR>
species of ants that are near extinction get lots of attention from
<BR>
humankind.  As we get more powerful why would this effort for and on
<BR>
behalf of Ants, Dogs, and everything else, ever decrease?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually we'll all be growing together, helping each other
<BR>
explore the infinite, and eternally sharing with each other the
<BR>
glorious different things we all as diverse entities discover.  Just
<BR>
like we started sharing smell and color sensations right?  There is a
<BR>
lot of infinite out there, the more diverse help and sharing we get
<BR>
from all, the more glorious it will forever be.  If some sentient
<BR>
species is missing, that will never be as good as if everyone is
<BR>
included.  So why would we ever be satisfied with less when we could
<BR>
have more?
<BR>
