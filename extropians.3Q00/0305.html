I'm sure he's a smart and quite rich businessman, and it's a good PR move to include him, but should you then find a more general or opposite word than `thinkers' in the title?

Naah. I think Arnold is an excellent world class thinker. Check out his movie &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; -:) Seriously, though, yes I think that he has influenced many people about the importance of overcoming odds which is not just an intellectual endeavor - it takes a lot of thinking and a lot of finesse. (Looking forward to reading the book!) Me too.

<BR>
<P>I saw &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; and felt the intelligence of Arnold came out despite his strong accent.  Poor Lou Ferrigno really suffered in trying to match wits with Arnie!!  
<BR>
<P>While working on his bodybuilding and acting career, Arnold went to college and got a business degree.  Old classmates and professors who were interviewed years later said he was very sharp and did well.  
<BR>
<P>Though bright and educated, perhaps Arnold is not a great thinker in terms of being an academic scholar, but he is a great DOER.
<BR>
<P>He is at an age now where though strong he is losing his vitality to the aging process.  I am sure his heart surgery had an effect on him also in sensing his mortality.  Perhaps he will be more open to the possibilities of cryonics and transhumanism leading him to a bright future of personal renewal.
