<P>Roger that.  A few years ago, the average lifespan for Lockheed retires
<BR>
was found to 61 years.  People began to panic.  Then spikemeister
<BR>
fired up the old spreadsheet and showed that this statistic did not
<BR>
account for the steep increase in the size of the company during and
<BR>
after the war.  The only figures in the database were for those
<BR>
unfortunates who had already perished.  Once this factor was
<BR>
compensated, the lifespan of the Lockheed retiree was actually
<BR>
higher than average for the American population, which makes
<BR>
sense because the company was so heavily caucasian.  spike
