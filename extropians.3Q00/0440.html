</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I've heard this kind of story a few times. The same deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happened to one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my Aunts. She fell in love with her first serious boyfriend,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got married,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had kids a dog etc. They always seemed like the perfect family,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nice car, very nice house and moved to a bigger and better house
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; every couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of years. They were the envy of the whole family.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Then after about 13 years of marriage she left because she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hadn't lived
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and wanted more out of life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Ironically, she remarried in about a year and now has kids, a dog etc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I think there is a moral in there somewhere. Personally I love being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; married and this is my second time. My marriage is far from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfect, but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly is fun.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Maybe the moral is something like this:  let people develop and grow as they
<BR>
will rather than trying to squash them into pre-packaged roles; life is
<BR>
dynamic--things that stay always the same are lifeless, so let change occur
<BR>
rather than trying to keep people and relationships always the same; when a
<BR>
relationship that has been good begins to be deteriorate and become stifling
<BR>
for one or another of the parties, change it, or let it go; when a
<BR>
relationship must end, think of it as a lesson learned or as growth rather
<BR>
than as a failure.  (these things are easy to say, but they don't seem to be
<BR>
easy for people to put into practice)
