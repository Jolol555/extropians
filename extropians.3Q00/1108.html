<P><EM>&gt;Probably Napster does have a leg to stand on; if they are infringing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;copyright by providing a way of moving mp3s between people, then so is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;email, and any other form of digital transmission.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I wonder; if I were to provide a free freight moving service to anyone in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the street, and did this in the middle of riot (so that my primary 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;customers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were looters), would I be infringing any laws?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, its called &quot;aiding and abetting.&quot;  The theory against Napster is that 
<BR>
they are committing &quot;vicarious and contributory infringement.&quot;  The RIAA 
<BR>
knows that *Napster* is not violating any copyrights itself (that would be 
<BR>
suicide), but the argument is that 99% of the people using their service do 
<BR>
so for the express purpose of stealing copyrighted music, Napster knows this 
<BR>
and does nothing to stop it (in fact that encourage it).
<BR>
<P>Napster is going to lose the lawsuit, but that will not stop the pirates 
<BR>
from doing what they do best.  MP3 piracy was alive and well before Napster 
<BR>
came along and will continue to be after Napster is gone.  Ever look around 
<BR>
IRC for MP3 channels?  They are nice and full and nice and busy, only thing 
<BR>
is no body is &quot;chatting.&quot;
