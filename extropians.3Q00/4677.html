<EM>&gt; &gt; When you speak of a &quot;PR&quot; model, do you mean that consciousness exists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (or appears to exist) primarily for the benefit of other people, rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than for yourself?  That is pretty much the case with PR departments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Perhaps you are conscious in order to make you appear to be more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; predictable and therefore reliable?  Would consciousness do this, though,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if it does not actually affect decision making?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Miller in &quot;The Mating Mind&quot; notes that fitness signals are best if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signalan average quality of much of the genome, and hypothsizes that much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our conscious thinking is there to impress others with our wit, cleverness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. So he suggests that this might explain why consciousness seems hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; localize in a particular brain module.  Our conscious minds are primarily there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to put on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a show for others, impressing them with an integrated set of cognitive skills.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We tell stories about how what we do is all part of the integrated plan where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we talk all our goals into account and use all our skills as appropriate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listening to us can then judge our overall cognitive abilities.
</EM><BR>
<P>I like the posts from Hal and Robin on this thread very much.  Dennet used the
<BR>
analogy of the 'Show Trials' put on in 1930's Russia where the judgment had been
<BR>
made before the trial, but it had to look as if justice was being done, to
<BR>
suggest that consciousness is after the fact in spite of the illusion.  Timings
<BR>
from brain scans indicate that during most of 'normal' consciousness what you
<BR>
think is happening now really happened about 1/4 second in the past (which is why
<BR>
you need to train subcortical structures to allow you to do tight servo loop
<BR>
things like riding a bicycle).
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that the PR is both for you and for everyone else as well, and is
<BR>
the key to being able to use symbolic representations for communication (as I am
<BR>
doing at this moment [I mean 1/4s ago]).  The comment from &quot;The Mating Mind&quot;
<BR>
above matches similar material from &quot;The Meme Machine&quot; (why do these books have
<BR>
the same initials and much of the same content?).  The story that goes along with
<BR>
the illusion of a stream of consciousness provides a means of structuring the
<BR>
placement of memories as symbolic representations in linear time (as if talking
<BR>
to yourself).  This is very useful and shows the intimate connection between
<BR>
communication and memory.
<BR>
<P>Keep going guys, you are helping folks to see that there is no homunculus in
<BR>
there, and how useful it is to pretend that there is.
