Franklin Wayne Poley wrote, regarding artificial intelligences and human
<BR>
ones:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do humans have some kind of &quot;psychic&quot; ability beyond any physical
</EM><BR>
structures and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; functioning which would always put them on a higher level?
</EM><BR>
<P>Interestingly, this is precisely what Alan Turing suspected. If you read his
<BR>
original paper proposing the &quot;Turing test&quot; for determining whether an AI has
<BR>
human-equivalent intelligence, you will see that Turing believed that ESP
<BR>
could be a significant factor. It's quite curious that this fact has been
<BR>
conveniently forgotten by so many of Turing's intellectual heirs.
<BR>
<P>Below is the relevant section from Turing's paper &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; in
<BR>
COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE.

<P>(9) The Argument from Extra-Sensory Perception  I assume that the reader is
<BR>
familiar with the idea of extra-sensory perception, and the meaning of the
<BR>
four items of it, viz. telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition and
<BR>
psycho-kinesis. These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual
<BR>
scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the
<BR>
statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very
<BR>
difficult to rearrange one's ideas so as to fit these new facts in. Once one
<BR>
has accepted them it does not seem a very big step to believe in ghosts and
<BR>
bogies. The idea that our bodies move simply according to the known laws of
<BR>
physics, together with some others not yet discovered but somewhat similar,
<BR>
would be one of the first to go.
<BR>
This argument is to my mind quite a strong one. One can say in reply that
<BR>
many scientific theories seem to remain workable in practice, in spite of
<BR>
clashing with E.S.P.; that in fact one can get along very nicely if one
<BR>
forgets about it. This is rather cold comfort, and one fears that thinking
<BR>
is just the kind of phenomenon where E.S.P. may be especially relevant.
<BR>
A more specific argument based on E.S.P. might run as follows:
<BR>
&quot;Let us play the imitation game, using as witnesses a man who is good as a
<BR>
telepathic receiver, and a digital computer. The interrogator can ask such
<BR>
questions as 'What suit does the card in my right hand belong to?' The man
<BR>
by telepathy or clairvoyance gives the right answer 130 times out of 400
<BR>
cards. The machine can only guess at random, and perhaps gets 104 right, so
<BR>
the interrogator makes the right identification.&quot; There is an interesting
<BR>
possibility which opens here. Suppose the digital computer contains a random
<BR>
number generator. Then it will be natural to use this to decide what answer
<BR>
to give. But then the random number generator will be subject to the
<BR>
psycho-kinetic powers of the interrogator. Perhaps this psycho-kinesis might
<BR>
cause the machine to guess right more often than would be expected on a
<BR>
probability calculation, so that the interrogator {p.454} might still be
<BR>
unable to make the right identification. On the other hand, he might be able
<BR>
to guess right without any questioning, by clairvoyance. With E.S.P.
<BR>
anything may happen.
<BR>
If telepathy is admitted it will be necessary to tighten our test up. The
<BR>
situation could be regarded as analogous to that which would occur if the
<BR>
interrogator were talking to himself and one of the competitors was
<BR>
listening with his ear to the wall. To put the competitors into a
<BR>
'telepathy-proof room' would satisfy all requirements.&quot;
<BR>
