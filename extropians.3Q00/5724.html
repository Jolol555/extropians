<P>Intelligence just makes the canvass larger. Grossly unequal players
<BR>
are exempt from increasingly benign/cooperative strategies emerged
<BR>
from iterated interactions of increased-intelligence players (being
<BR>
smart also includes being able to identify parties you've dealt with,
<BR>
and keeping a track record of interaction history). I'm pretty sure
<BR>
vegans and animal rights activists have irrational reasons for what
<BR>
they're doing.
<BR>
<P>I don't see any rational reason for being nice to those who can't
<BR>
reciprocate. (Of course I'm still being nice, I'm only human).
