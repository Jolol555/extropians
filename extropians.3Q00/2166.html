But the recent statistical analysis of the experimental data already shows
<BR>
also that the distribution of galaxies is fractal up to the deepest observed
<BR>
scales.

Odd you should mention this now, as a lot of press has been given lately
<BR>
to the Two-Degree Field survey finally that structure is no longer fractal
<BR>
above about 300 Million light years.
<BR>
<P><P>Prof. L. Pietronero wrote that one of the most extraordinary findindings of
<BR>
the last two decades in observational cosmology has been the existence of a
<BR>
network of voids and structures in the distribution of galaxies in space.
<BR>
The enormous scales of these structures were completely unsuspected in
<BR>
earlier extensive observations of galaxy distributions, in which only
<BR>
angular coordinates were measured, obscuring the richness subsequently
<BR>
revealed in the third coordinate. These findindings have become increasingly
<BR>
difficult to reconcile with standard cosmological theories, in which the
<BR>
approach to homogeneity at large scales is a central element.
<BR>
<P>Observationally, however, not only the scale at which the matter
<BR>
distribution approaches an average density, but the very existence of such a
<BR>
scale, remains the subject of intense debate.
<BR>
<P>At small scales it is well established that the distribution of galaxies is
<BR>
fractal, and the debate can be phrased in terms of the deviation from this
<BR>
behaviour towards homogeneity. Some consensus has been achieved about the
<BR>
optimal statistical methods to use in the analysis of three dimensional
<BR>
data. 
<BR>
<P>Independently of the data, however, resistance to the fractal picture is
<BR>
certainly to a considerable degree due to the conviction that it is
<BR>
incompatible with the framework of the standard theories and in particular
<BR>
with the high degree of isotropy of the microwave background radiation.
<BR>
<P>In this respect one should note that in standard models the origin of
<BR>
radiation and baryonic matter is separate, with the latter
<BR>
being created in a process completely distinct from the origin of the
<BR>
primordial radiation bath.
<BR>
<P>The isotropy of the latter is therefore not fundamentally tied to the
<BR>
distribution of the matter, and the only real constraint is how much any
<BR>
such distribution actually perturbs the radiation.
<BR>
<P>May I also ask: is cosmology a science?
