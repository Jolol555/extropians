Just a few thoughts:  The other night I accidentally tuned in to &quot;Red
<BR>
Dwarf.&quot;  The computer convinced one of the characters to erase part of its
<BR>
&quot;memory.&quot;  Problem was that it had read every single book ever written -
<BR>
supposedly stored in its &quot;library&quot; - and was bored.  So it wanted all the
<BR>
Agathe Christy novels erased so that it could have the pleasure of reading
<BR>
them again.
<BR>
<P>Question: What is the precise difference between having the novels in
<BR>
&quot;memory&quot; and in &quot;storage?&quot;  Presumably the computer could access the
<BR>
information in the library via any number of algorythmic searches or even
<BR>
spawn intelligent agents to do more sophisticated access to the actual
<BR>
informational content and meaning.  What additional factor is involved in
<BR>
actually reading it that isn't present in intelligent transclusion?
<BR>
<P>In terms related to uploading, what would be the difference between my
<BR>
moving the library of congress - or just a single book - into my RAM or the
<BR>
equivalent and my actually &quot;reading&quot; the material in question?

<P>If nanotech shows up and nobody has a seed AI around, then we might want to
<BR>
try hacking up some kind of neural-computer interface, or hack up an
<BR>
interbrain connection by yoking random neurons together.  The trouble is, I
<BR>
don't see how an interbrain connection could be implemented on the
<BR>
necessary
<BR>
scale - say, a hundred-million-neuron crossover - without nanotechnology or
<BR>
something similar.
<BR>
<P>But if someone figures out how to yoke neurons together using optical
<BR>
fibers,
<BR>
and automate the implantation process so it can be done on the necessary
<BR>
scale
<BR>
- then I say go for it!  Get a dozen suicide volunteers; try yoking
<BR>
together
<BR>
one neuron in every minicolumn, or one minicolumn in every macrocolumn, or
<BR>
select an entire macrocolumn and wire it up.  Either you'll get telepathy,
<BR>
or
<BR>
the volunteer will keel over and die, or nothing will happen, or the
<BR>
cognitive
<BR>
processes will be damaged in ways that range from the subtle to the
<BR>
horrific...
<BR>
<P>Obviously this is a measure of desperation.  Realistically, I don't see
<BR>
anyone
<BR>
getting a permit to use the necessary medical nanotechnology before
<BR>
military
<BR>
hell breaks loose.  I got my start in human IE, and neurohacking is a
<BR>
bona-fide path to the Singularity, but currently I'm sticking with seed AI.
