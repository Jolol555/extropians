<P>
For the record, I'd like to say that I've been following this thread with
<BR>
great interest.  Lots of viewpoints I hadn't been aware of before.
<BR>
<P>It's nice to see the list discussing the &quot;tough today&quot; issues, not just the
<BR>
&quot;technical tomorrow&quot; stuff (not that it never discusses things relevant in
<BR>
the here-and now, but that from the outside it could look like we never
<BR>
touch upon more everyday issues).
<BR>
<P>I'm quite surprised actually that the ladies involved in the thread seem
<BR>
quite at home speaking of fathers' rights, even veto power.  Most women
<BR>
I've ever met would certainly disagree (as would some men), but I think
<BR>
they generally argue from a moral point of view rather than a pragmatic
<BR>
one.  I do think de facto voluntary absolute infertility is the way to go.
<BR>
I'm sure all people would much prefer an opt in approach to pregnancy, an
<BR>
ideal we've yet to attain for both genders at 100% effectiveness.
<BR>
<P>I've seen many women here in Ireland who've gotten pregnant thinking they'd
<BR>
&quot;hook their man&quot;, only to find he had other ideas.  Perhaps that's more a
<BR>
case of naivete than a birth control issue though..
<BR>
<P>Slan,
