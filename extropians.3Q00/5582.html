<P>Not true.  I view a gun in the process of firing at me as a deterministic
<BR>
process, but guess what, it's going to win.  Just because something is
<BR>
deterministic doesn't mean that I can control it.

<P>Believers in the omnipotence of AIs seem to think that for any given
<BR>
person, in any given situation, there is some input they can be given
<BR>
which will cause them to produce any desired output.  If I see a nun
<BR>
in the middle of prayer in the chapel, there is something I can say to
<BR>
her that will make her immediately start screeching like a chimp while
<BR>
jumping around the room scratching herself.
<BR>
<P>I am baffled by this degree of faith in the power of information.  There
<BR>
is no evidence that people are so malleable.
