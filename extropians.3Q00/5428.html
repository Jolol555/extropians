<EM>&gt; What I'm getting at is, I am not following just how it is that any real

<EM>&gt; entropy calculations?

<P>As far as I know the MWI is not a theory about physical, real,
<BR>
objective worlds. These worlds are - for the observer - just a
<BR>
subjective concept, perceptions, consciousness.
<BR>
All these worlds form the universe, which is real, one,
<BR>
physical, objective.
<BR>
<P>For a supporter of MWI the probability *may* be some measure
<BR>
of the existence of his world (he is not stupid, he knows there
<BR>
are many more worlds, he knows that his world is existent like
<BR>
any other world). This measure comes out from the decomposition
<BR>
of the universe in worlds (each world orthogonal to the other).
<BR>
But the number or worlds is very far from being defined.
<BR>
These worlds continue to multiply!. That's the reason because
<BR>
(I suppose) Everett called his theory &quot;Relative State&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Note that the question &quot;God plays - or does not play - dice&quot;
<BR>
has a very different taste in MWI:
<BR>
<P>Note also that the number of worlds is (perhaps) much bigger
<BR>
than the number of different outcomes in a quantum experiment.
<BR>
<P>To normalize this situation you must introduce (in my
<BR>
opinion) some decoherence (decoherent histories,
<BR>
decoherent worlds) or some objective probability or some
<BR>
2nd order collapse (world-collapse) or something else .......
<BR>
<P>But I'm not sure ... I answered your questions.
