<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  You bring up a good point however.  As society becomes more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transparent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the prudish must be displaced from positions of power, replaced by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  tolerant and cool.  This is kinda already happened in the Silicon 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Valley,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the charge being led by those who started Apple.  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Spike, I'd like to think that this is automatically true, but I don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is.  Small rural communities were very transparent in the past, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weren't necessarily characterized by high levels of tolerance.  Check out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;The Crucible&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Small rural communities differ from a transparent world in one huge way.  
<BR>
People who live in small rural communities tend to have a common culture.  
<BR>
They go to the same churches, belong to the same organizations and because 
<BR>
the community is small, each member tends to have a much greater influence 
<BR>
on his friends and neighbors than he would have living in, say, New York 
<BR>
City.  Whereas in a ubiquitous transparent society, the culture would be an 
<BR>
amalgam of many disparate cultures (again like you have in New York) and 
<BR>
since no one culture will hold sway over any other, tolerance will be the 
<BR>
natural result, as you have (for the most part) in New York.
