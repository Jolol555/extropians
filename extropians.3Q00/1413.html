<P>
<EM>&gt; If you want to argue that information should be free because of 'x,'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then you'll have to allow me to argue 'x.'
</EM><BR>
<P>I absolutely refuse to engange in rational argument with someone who
<BR>
will not simply acknowledge facts of reality and move on.  Atoms and
<BR>
/patterns/ of atoms are different things, and always will be.  I am not
<BR>
using this as a reason to treat patterns in a specific way, only to
<BR>
explain why we should not automatically assume that methods we have
<BR>
used to treat matter shouldn't automatically be applied to patterns.
<BR>
This is not an arguable issue--it is a simple fact of nature.  Maybe
<BR>
treating patterns of property is a good idea after all; I'd like to
<BR>
see arguments that actually address whether it is or not.  But I've
<BR>
seen nothing but statements that they are the same, and that we should
<BR>
therefore treat them the same, and those arguments are false.  Please
<BR>
come up with something better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In much of the rest of this posting you look for increasingly wily ways in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I -really- can make money off of my performance/book/movie/software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.  I'm sorta tired of engaging each example specifically, and frankly I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think they're becoming a little silly-- your money making opportunities have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty much shrunk to cashing in on &quot;timeliness,&quot; and &quot;authenticity&quot;-- both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of which will continue to shrink as the technology gets better.  (i.e.: I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can copy your stuff faster and better.)
</EM><BR>
<P>That is an arguable point.  Can you give me examples of how the value of
<BR>
timeliness and authenticity are decreasing with technology, or why they
<BR>
reasonably should?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Personally, even -if- I granted that these will be good revenue streams in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the future, I still don't think it's a smart idea to build auxiliary reward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems like these.  If we want good innovative content we need to engineer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an environment in which that sort of content will be rewarded.  It's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient to simply reward content-- we need to create selection pressures
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that reward the sort of content we're looking for.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  Copyrights and patents reward a specific kind of creativity over
<BR>
others.  Namely, speculative innovation and novelty, at the expense of
<BR>
gradual stepwise refinement, craftsmanship, and service.  If you can show
<BR>
me how &quot;novelty&quot;, in and of itself, is so valuable that we should
<BR>
encourage it for its own sake, I absolutely agree that copyrights and
<BR>
patents are a good way to encourage that.
<BR>
<P>I just don't worship novelty for its own sake.  What difference would it
<BR>
make to society if inventions evolved by the gradual refinements of 1000
<BR>
people free to make changes in existing things, or from the all-at-once
<BR>
drastic invention of lone geniuses working in isolation?  If you ask me,
<BR>
I'd much prefer the former.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You want to directly pay for construction workers, but not architects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For CD manufacturors, not musicians.  For theatre owners, not filmmakers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For book binders, not authors.
</EM><BR>
<P>I also won't argue with what someone else makes up in his mind about what
<BR>
I have said, rather than arguing with what I've /actually/ said.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eventually -everything- is going to be intellectual property Mr. Crocker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The world of blacksmiths and automobile manfacturors is shrinking.  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so called 'differences' between information and material goods that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argue are going away.
</EM><BR>
<P>Laws of nature don't go away.  They may become less economically relevant.
<BR>
It's true that the value of conserved mass-energy may become smaller and
<BR>
smaller compared to the economic value of their patterns.  If anything,
<BR>
this argues in favor of the idea that /demand/ for patterns will increase,
<BR>
and those wh demand them will find ever more ingenious ways to pay for
<BR>
having them created.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; True, so that would be a stupid business model, wouldn't it?  Movies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; should be licensed to theater owners under NDA, who are given encryption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keys in exchange for agreeing to the terms of how to distribute ticket
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; revenues.  Ticket revenues alone, without any licensing whatsover, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more than enough to make money for good movies.  Even the $100M+ movies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; made millions in profit on ticket sales
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; alone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Non-disclosure agreements and encryption?  You're going down a dangerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; road here Mr. Crocker-- I'm certain you're about to argue a side of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument with which you do not agree:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can't encrypt the final transmittal of information.  Go to Bali sometime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and see how many restaurants show new release movies that were shot on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone's handicam.  Also, it's irrelevant.  I've witnessed excellent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; versions of both 'The Matrix' and 'Star Wars: Episode I' during the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; week of those films release and I happen to know that people possess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bootlegs of films that _have_not_yet_been_released. (There goes timeliness.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please don't argue that we can successfully protect this information since I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really doubt that you believe that.  The only thing we can currently protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against is mass commercialization of this bootleg material-- which is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say: it's still hard for me to start screening this material on a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public webpage.  As yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's very hard to protect information, but your examples don't really hold
<BR>
up, because they are example of what happens in a world where copyright is
<BR>
the underlying assumption.  Movies have &quot;release&quot; dates only because they
<BR>
assume that copyright will protect them in the meantime.  Without that,
<BR>
they'd have to take more serious measures.  Secure hardware can do some of
<BR>
that, but you're correct that even that won't defend against minimally-
<BR>
degraded digital versions a day after release.  But movies will still be
<BR>
in demand, and they will still make money, and therefore still be made.
<BR>
Nothing you've said here will change that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; That's true, but the system as it is has manipulated the market and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; artists to think that copyright is the only way to make money, so they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't pursue options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why should they pursue other options?  People want music, so musicians make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; music.  If people want easy-to-find music, or t-shirts to go with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; music, then other people (distributors and clothing manufacturors,) should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come in to fill those markets.
</EM><BR>
<P>They should pursue other options, because those other options increase
<BR>
freedom, rather than restricting it as does copyright.  My goal here is
<BR>
freedom--the absence of physical coercion.  Within that constraint, I
<BR>
think making money is a grand thing to do; especially since it increases
<BR>
the number of things you can do with freedom.  But I don't want to give
<BR>
up even a small bit of freedom just so some certain acts can make more
<BR>
money.  Money is just a means, freedom is the end.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Please refrain from stating:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;B should be treated differently from A, because B possesses property x&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you're going to continue to refuse to discuss:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;If A had property x, should it too be treated differently?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>If pigs had wings, would pork be kosher?  If pi were 3, would circles
<BR>
be hexagons?  I don't discuss the issue because it's a silly
<BR>
counterfactual that has no relevance to anything, but if you really
<BR>
insist, then yes, if matter had the property of being able to serve
<BR>
the wills of any number people at one time, then &quot;ownership&quot; wouldn't
<BR>
be a necessary concept for matter either.  That's much the way it is
<BR>
for commodities like air on Earth.  So what?  That doesn't change the
<BR>
substance of any argument presented here on either side, and I don't
<BR>
see why you think it does.
<BR>
