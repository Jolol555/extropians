<P>The same considerations you discuss are relevant to many non-business
<BR>
problems.  I'm thinking of medical diagnostic software in particular.
<BR>
No doctor (and presumably some patients) is going to trust a diagnostic 
<BR>
program that cannot clearly explain its reasoning.
<BR>
<P>The AI community realized this early on, and it's a standard feature in
<BR>
research and commercial expert systems.  
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, people make megabuck decisions every day based on 
<BR>
data mining techniques -- including neural nets and genetic programming --
<BR>
that are known to work, but may be hard to understand or seem counter-intuitive.  
<BR>
One approach managers can use to sleep better at night is to not to rely on
<BR>
a result unless it's been confirmed with two different model types.  Of
<BR>
course, this nearly doubles the mining cost....  TANSTAAFL.
