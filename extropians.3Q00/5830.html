<P><EM>&gt; Seriously, did you ever do a back of the envelope? You need a lot more

<EM>&gt; than a few minutes, unless your starting point is way above the

<P>back of the envelope? Whazzat? I was thinking that evolutionary algorithms can
<BR>
iterate in microseconds as opposed to the days, weeks, months, years, decades
<BR>
required for living organisms to replicate and produce new generations.
<BR>
Natural selection in digital computers cycles billions of times faster than
<BR>
natural selection in biology, right?
<BR>
<P>(I'm still counting on un-natural selection to insure that AI would want to be
<BR>
friendly.)

<P>&quot;J. Doyne Farmer was in that group of physicists at Los Alamos who were starting
<BR>
to think about complexity, nonlinear phenomena, and adaptive systems. They began
<BR>
to realize that things like 'strange attractors' were really ubiquitous in any
<BR>
kind of system -- economic systems and biological systems, not just physical
<BR>
systems. That was an incredibly important idea, because it allowed all these
<BR>
people to start talking to each other.&quot;
