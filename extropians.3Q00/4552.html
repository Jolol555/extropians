<EM>&gt;  &gt;suddenly had thousands of mentally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;ill people thrust upon them, unmedicated with no shelter. It was an ugly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;sight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Somewhat similar here. But at least we're starting to `trial', as they put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it, `safe injecting rooms' where addicts can shoot up without killing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  themselves and littering the alleys and shop doorsteps. Much righteous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  indignation from clerics and olde farts, of course.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>yeah, I heard about it on public radio. This is like the clean needles 
<BR>
programs here, but taken one step further.
<BR>
<P>Junkies and mentally ill people without medication are a different thing! 
<BR>
<P>Mentally ill people won't  take any money away from the cheapos , they mostly 
<BR>
avoid anything to do with authority anyway, or are just too bewildered and 
<BR>
disoriented to fill out the paperwork required to get aid. They don't have 
<BR>
the wherewithal to procure heroin. They aren't very good at crime either. 
<BR>
Most of the &quot;dirty&quot; people you remember viewing in the US skid row areas are 
<BR>
mentally ill. 
<BR>
<P>LA has a serious problem here. In fact they flock here, since it's the 
<BR>
farthest west you can go, so they end up here and the weathers good for 
<BR>
sleeping outdoors!
<BR>
<P>They do strange rituals, talk to themselves,  collect garbage bags and appear 
<BR>
in various odd outfits. One hopes they are mostly harmless, though they are 
<BR>
very scary.
<BR>
<P>They used to have huge shanty towns down at the beach and set up downtown 
<BR>
when I first moved here in the 80's. It was horrifying.
<BR>
<P>Lately it's gotten *way* better, due to police sweeps and increased 
<BR>
outpatient care, The feeding programs have helped a lot, too. 
<BR>
<P>Now it's condensed into one small, very smelly, skid row area by the downtown 
<BR>
missions. You can barely drive through there for fear of hitting someone, 
<BR>
since they seem oblivious to the outside world. Thousands of people wander 
<BR>
aimlessly through this four square block area. Any tourists planning on 
<BR>
visiting? It's 3rd St near Los Angeles St : - ) 
<BR>
<P>N
<BR>
BTW I'm not sure how wise free shooting galleries are. It will undoubtedly 
<BR>
keep some dirty needles from underfoot, but how does that help curb the main 
<BR>
problem: heroin addiction...
