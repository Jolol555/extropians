<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE SEPTEMBER 8 2000
<BR>
<P>IN THIS ISSUE:  LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Long lasting Interferon
<BR>
to be tried in hepatitis C; PROTOCOL:  Hepatitis C; FEATURED PRODUCTS OF
<BR>
THE WEEK:  Silymarin, Hepastat;  LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE September 2000

<BR>
<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<BR>
Long lasting Interferon to be tried in hepatitis C
<BR>
<P>Approximately 4 million people in the United States may have hepatitis C,
<BR>
which is an inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver cancer, and
<BR>
the reason for the majority of liver transplants. The disease is often
<BR>
contracted through intravenous drug use or blood transfusions. Its
<BR>
symptoms often do not show up for twenty to thirty years following
<BR>
exposure. More Americans are expected to die from hepatits C in the coming
<BR>
decades than from HIV.
<BR>
<P>The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania will be one
<BR>
of the seven sites in Pennsylvania to conduct clinical trials on a new,
<BR>
longer lasting form of Interferon with Hepatitis C patients. Patients
<BR>
admitted to the study must have failed previous treatments. Thomas J.
<BR>
McGarrity, M.D., professor of medicine at Penn State's College of Medicine
<BR>
and a gastroenterologist at The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center
<BR>
commented, &quot;The standard treatment for hepatitis C is three injections per
<BR>
week with Interferon and, by mouth, the drug Ribavirin. This new
<BR>
investigational drug is essentially a long-lasting form of Interferon that
<BR>
will require only one injection per week. We think the virus might
<BR>
actually have a chance to recover with several shots per week. With this
<BR>
long-lasting therapy, there will be fewer peaks and valleys and hopefully
<BR>
no time for the virus to recover. The treatment will last for one year.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Two hundred patients will be enrolled in the phase III clinical trial. Six
<BR>
months following completion of the study, patients will be tested for the
<BR>
virus. If they are free of the virus, Dr McGarrity feels that is unlikely
<BR>
that it would return.  For information about enrollment, contact the Life
<BR>
Extension Foundation at the email address below.
<BR>
<P><P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Hepatitis C
<BR>
<P>The CDC has estimated that 20 to 50% of infected hepatitis C patients will
<BR>
develop liver cirrhosis, and 20 to 30% of those will go on to develop
<BR>
liver cancer or liver failure requiring a liver transplant. Hepatitis C
<BR>
infection contributes to the deaths of 8,000 to 10,000 Americans every
<BR>
year.  Hepatitis C used to be called non-A/non-B hepatitis and was not
<BR>
considered a significant health risk. The growing awareness of this new
<BR>
viral epidemic has resulted in more research being conducted on hepatitis
<BR>
C than on any other cause of liver disease.
<BR>
<P>People are diagnosed with hepatitis C when a blood test reveals a positive
<BR>
reading for the hepatitis C antibody. While the hepatitis C antibody test
<BR>
can diagnose whether one may have the disease, the blood test that
<BR>
identifies and measures the overall viral load is the polymerase chain
<BR>
reaction test (PCR). Standard tests to measure hepatitis C activity
<BR>
include the liver function tests SGOT, SGPT, GGTP, and alkaline
<BR>
phosphatase. Hepatitis C antibody tests can accurately diagnose hepatitis
<BR>
C infection, but they are not always precise in evaluating the success of
<BR>
treatments.
<BR>
<P>The Life Extension Foundation's protocol for hepatitis C includes:
<BR>
1. The standard dose of alpha-interferon.
<BR>
2. 1000 to 1200 mg a day of ribavirin.
<BR>
3. The standard doses of Life Extension Mix and Life Extension Herbal Mix.
<BR>
Please note that some hepatitis C patients encounter liver enzyme
<BR>
elevations in response to the moderate doses of vitamin A, niacin, and
<BR>
beta-carotene in Life Extension Mix.
<BR>
4.  High doses of green tea polyphenols (300 to 900 mg/day and garlic
<BR>
(2000 to 4000 mg/day of a high-allicin garlic supplement) to reduce serum
<BR>
and liver iron levels to a minimum.
<BR>
5. Liver-protecting nutrients and immune-boosting therapies such as 200 mg
<BR>
of milk thistle extract, twice a day; 500 mg of licorice extract, 3 times
<BR>
a day; 800 mcg a day of selenium; 1200 mg a day of N-acetylcysteine; and
<BR>
vitamin C ranging from 4000 to 10,000 mg a day.
<BR>
6. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) for the purpose of protecting and restoring
<BR>
liver cell function destroyed by the hepatitis C virus.
<BR>
7. Alpha-lipoic acid, 250 mg 2 times a day to boost glutathione levels in
<BR>
liver cells.
<BR>
8. L-glutathione, 500 mg, 3 times a day.
<BR>
9. Whey protein concentrate/isolate powder, 30 to 60 grams a day.
<BR>
10. Grape-seed extract (85 to 95% proanthocyanidin) 100 mg, 2 to 3 times a
<BR>
day.
<BR>
11. Make sure serum iron levels are at the lowest possible tolerable
<BR>
levels.
<BR>
12. Melatonin, 500 mcg to 6 mg.

<BR>
Life Extension Wins in the House and Senate
<BR>
<P>In a startling setback to the FDA and the drug cartel, a bill that enables
<BR>
Americans to legally obtain lower cost prescription drugs from other
<BR>
countries passed the House of Representatives on June 29, 2000. This is
<BR>
great news for consumers who have been paying inflated prices for their
<BR>
medications because the FDA inappropriately blocked the importation of
<BR>
less expensive drugs from other countries.
<BR>
<P>The pharmaceutical industry's panicked response has been to run full-page
<BR>
newspaper ads stating that prescription drugs from Mexico and Canada are
<BR>
somehow &quot;counterfeit&quot; and cannot be trusted. This is a truly remarkable
<BR>
allegation when one considers that the lower priced drugs from Canada and
<BR>
Mexico are often manufactured by these very same pharmaceutical companies.
<BR>
<P>The drug industry is using scare tactics that have no basis in fact to
<BR>
block Americans from gaining access to lower-cost prescription
<BR>
medications, and the FDA wholeheartedly supports the drug companies.
<BR>
American citizens, on the other hand, are revolting against outrageously
<BR>
high drug prices.
<BR>
<P>On July 20, 2000, the Senate passed a similar bill-by a vote of 74-21-that
<BR>
allows pharmacists and wholesalers to import US-approved drugs available
<BR>
at lower prices overseas. The House bill, on the other hand, lets
<BR>
individuals buy drugs abroad, so a compromise measure is now being crafted.
<BR>
<P>Some people still think the FDA protects us against dangerous drugs. As
<BR>
you will read in this month's issue, when humanitarian FDA employees tried
<BR>
to alert the public about a dangerous drug, the FDA launched an internal
<BR>
affairs investigation and threatened these honorable people with
<BR>
imprisonment. This shocking fact was exposed by the Los Angeles Times and
<BR>
we have reprinted this report in its entirety in a story entitled, &quot;The
<BR>
Rise and Fall of the Killer Drug Rezulin.&quot;
