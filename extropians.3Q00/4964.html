Spike reponded:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Emlyn O'Regan wrote many wonderful notions in his homeless post,
</EM><BR>
including:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ...As far as I can see, the tools have improved incredibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beyond what I was using 10 years ago when I started uni. So much more is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possible; it's astounding. And yet, paradoxically, it is harder than
</EM><BR>
ever to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be a programmer. The job is getting more and more difficult. Why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, Emlyn has been hiding his light under a bushel.  Why do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indulge in as many wisecracks as... I do, when you are capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing insightful passages like these?  Shame!  {8-]
</EM><BR>
<P>Same reason you do old boy; too much work in it. Much more fun up here in
<BR>
the balcony, laughing at the frog (hey there Waldo).
<BR>
<P>By the way, don't tell anyone that I said programming is getting harder; all
<BR>
the other code geeks will call me names and hide my pocket protector.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your notion of software implosion is something I have pondered often.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am surely not alone when I confess I have developed code (excel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; macro upon macro upon macro) which eventually became so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spaghetti-ed and complicated, I could no longer debug the mess.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier to start over and do it right than try to fix the abomination.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Excel invites this kind of morass, because the macros start out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simple, then one tends to add shell after shell over time, kinda
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like... windoze 98.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snipped most of design for excel based Scorch implementation]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It gets worse from there.  It is easy to set up a spreadsheet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that calculates every second, looks up an atmospheric
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; density, calulates a drag, repeats.  But then, well, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmosphere table is in increments of 500 meters, and thats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, so why not write a linear interpolator?  Well, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmosphere is actually more exponential, so how about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an exponential interpolator?  Next, a drag coefficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routine that accounts for the increase in drag at and above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mach 1, then lets correct for deltas in viscosity of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atmosphere, and pretty soon its a mess of code that grows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and grows in an uncontrolled fashion, layer upon layer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until it can no longer be debugged.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The whole project is a total loss.  Easier to just start over,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and do it right this time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can very easily imagine this case being analogous to what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could happen to our interconnected networks.  It really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could overwhelm our best efforts.  At this point Im not even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of the solution, Im still part of the problem.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not as bad as you make out. That whole process you went through in
<BR>
Excel can be chalked up to prototyping, because the thing you design for
<BR>
version 2 will be well informed by your experience in Excel, and will likely
<BR>
be a much better, focussed effort, and eventually more useful and satisfying
<BR>
product, than if you'd started by doing it &quot;the right way&quot;.
<BR>
<P>This is essentially the RAD development approach (yes I'm a heretic), and is
<BR>
a pretty common way to go nowadays. The key point to absorb is that it is ok
<BR>
to throw your work away and start again, because you are never really
<BR>
starting again; you take what you learned in the last stage, and apply it to
<BR>
the next. One corollary of this approach - make sure you learn something
<BR>
from past efforts, especially the mistakes!
<BR>
<P>The networked internet &amp; business world is much like a giant version of
<BR>
this. People cobble stuff together as quickly as possible, and are hitting
<BR>
local development maximas all over the place, all the time. They throw
<BR>
things out and rebuild them, head in new directions, pop on some patches,
<BR>
fire some people, jump up and down a bit, and the world goes on. The giant
<BR>
software object which is all of these systems, all talking to each other,
<BR>
all trying to do their own little bits of the giant whole (whatever that
<BR>
is), is actually kind of robust, so far, even though it's parts are not,
<BR>
because all these people are scratching away, tinkering and breaking bits
<BR>
and fixing other bits and so on. It even gains functionality steadily.
<BR>
Dynamism in action.
<BR>
<P>I think human ingenuity will overcome the &quot;intractable&quot; problems we see now.
<BR>
What else can I say? I'm an optimist. That'll get me killed one day, of
<BR>
course.
<BR>
