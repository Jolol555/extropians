</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;world of scarcity where even mere surival actually is pretty problematic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The trouble is we haven't thought past genetic conditioning that is largely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;outmoded.   - samantha &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Samantha,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Can you imagine the greed, jealousy and short sightedness present in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people that don't want to see others have anything?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     I was raised in a poor segment of society.  Early on I was let hnow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;my ticket out was in &quot;hitting the books.&quot;  When I was in college I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ridiculed gently by my friends for not going to work and &quot;making some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;money.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Early in my career, the &quot;sphagetti years,&quot; those same friends offered to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;help me get a &quot;good job.&quot;  Then when things came my way they said, &quot;I never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;had it lucky like you.&quot;  Now that we are all retired they want the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;govament&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to give them more.  They never connect the dots and realise the money to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;give them more&quot; will come from their very children that need the money to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;raise their grandchildren.  Yet statistics show that we retirees have more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;discretionary income than the group that is raising children.  Greed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of foresight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Ron H.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So then what are you saying? You worked harder thna others and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *prevailed*...over them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for making my point: society is a competition...there are winnners
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and losers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>What a wierd conclusion to draw from the above!  It is one conclusion
<BR>
that can be drawn but certainly not the only one or the most important. 
<BR>
&quot;Prevailing over&quot; assumes that their are winners and losers and always
<BR>
and forever more will be.  It assumes that competition always trumps
<BR>
cooperation, that the gain of one is the loss of another, that we live
<BR>
in a zero sum game. The main point of the above that I got is that
<BR>
intelligence and understanding is much more important than just hard
<BR>
work and that taking a longer view is the way to happiness and success. 
<BR>
The message was not about beating someone else.  The others were offered
<BR>
as contrast.
<BR>
