<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Samantha, I beg to differ on this one. Decades ago Unions were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strong and were in a position (for good and bad) to exploit the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stupidities of management. Since the 1970's there certainly has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been a fall-off in Unions in the USA. Some of this is structural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as Americans priced themselves out of the global labor market, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some cases , producing goods like cars and electronics that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese would beat on both price 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and quality! Let us not forget the Labor lawyers hired buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporations to beat the Unions, and get legislators to enact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-Union laws. Now the lawyers have turned around and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enticed workers to sue on a conditional basis, in many cases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;splitting the fee 50/50  when the achive a win. Corporation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;management is afraid of lawyers. For they have produced a legal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;system that in a darwinian sense, has come back to bite them on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their asses.
</EM><BR>
<P>Spike,
<BR>
<P>There are 5 car plants at last count who's total production output
<BR>
goes to Japan, likewise Sony will tell you that it's electronic
<BR>
manufacturing/assembly plants in the U.S. have the highest
<BR>
productivity/quality of any of their plants.
<BR>
<P>These facilities were moved here because it was cheaper to
<BR>
manufacture here. One of the key components for productivity is the
<BR>
education level of the workforce, yes even in assembly tasks.
<BR>
<P>The majority of scientists in this country are Union.
<BR>
<P>The millionare players of the NBA, NFL, etc, are Union.
<BR>
<P>The AMA at it's last meeting voted to Unionize.
