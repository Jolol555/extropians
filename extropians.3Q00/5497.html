<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;A random person in the world will be chosen, and you get this choice:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;a) Let them have $X more worth of real resources (such as by telling 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;to find an oil reserve that would otherwise remain unfound.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;b) Nothing happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Which do you choose?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would choose not to give it to him. I do so because I know that if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; person (person Y) is wealthier, then that means that whatever wealth I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is lessened. If Joe X wants to sell some property and I want to buy it, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have if I let this person Y have the oil wealth which would otherwise 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unfound, then there is more competition for the property I bidding for, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the price goes up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That does not follow unless you believe wealth is static.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Hmm. Jargon? Dogma?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;competition if the person wants the same limited resource as you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is also one more person with more resources, which, if used wisely will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;produce more wealth for you and everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<P>There was a tribe of protohumans in the valley. Protohuman Mac finds a nice 
<BR>
chunk of chert (flint), hard to find in the valley. Previously, protohuman 
<BR>
Joe had the only chunk of chert in the valley and he was going to trade it 
<BR>
for the semi-rancid gazelle carcass that some other protohuman had found, 
<BR>
and with that, he was going to lure that comely female protohuman Velma into 
<BR>
the bushes, and thereby pass on his genes. But now, with his bigger chunk of 
<BR>
chert, Mac gets to pass on his genes.
<BR>
Do you think Joe, if he were not able to get the chert himself, would have 
<BR>
told Mac where it was? Velma womb is the limited resources here, ultimately.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would take the chance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the competition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bid adieu to the gene pool, then.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Wealth is relative, in many respects (and this does not pertain to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heightened standards of living caused by the accumulation of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefits of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technology &amp; engineering, etc).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So why do people choose not to let this person Y have the wealth, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;why do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we not know why they make this decision?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Because people make these types of decisions without thinking. They 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have to think about it. There is a survival advantage to thinking this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's bred into us over eons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is a survival advantage only in a world of scarcity where even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mere surival actually is pretty problematic.
</EM><BR>
<P>THat's how it was and is. Even now, we often enforce artificial scarcity for 
<BR>
the most valuable resources in our society (medical care, real estate, etc). 
<BR>
Even now, wealth is relative.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;The trouble is we haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought past genetic conditioning that is largely outmoded.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can you support that statement with examples?
