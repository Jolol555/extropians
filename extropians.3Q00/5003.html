<EM>&gt; 	i did not mean &quot;we&quot; as in &quot;we are borg.&quot; however, the discussion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was about wide-spread power, and i did operate under the expectation that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some kind of majority attitude would emerge (however diverse the reasons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for holding these attitudes) and that the majority would have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources to enforce the policies it adopted.
</EM><BR>
<P>It may be that a majority will succeed at restricting access to space
<BR>
resources, at least for a while.  But as it becomes relatively cheaper
<BR>
to get a seed system into space the situation seems likely to go unstable
<BR>
eventually.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; i feel the said scenario
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have a broadly similar effect upon the attitudes of a variety of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; groups because i see resource scarcity as the most potent force underlying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social divergence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know about that last part.  Resource scarcity as an engine of
<BR>
conflict, sure.  But as the source of social divergence?  I'd suggest
<BR>
that we see at least as much social diversity among the richest nations
<BR>
as among the poor (although I suppose the direction of causation could
<BR>
go in the other direction).
<BR>
<P>When you're wealthy you have the luxury to indulge your whims and desires.
<BR>
With modern communications you can find like-minded individuals anywhere
<BR>
in the world to reinforce your quirkiest beliefs.  I can't count the
<BR>
number of times I've seen people say, &quot;man, I thought I was the only one
<BR>
who thought/felt this way, until I found this group...&quot;  I suspect that
<BR>
a wealthy future world will have far more diversity and social variation
<BR>
than we see today.
