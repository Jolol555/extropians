I have posted this idea, but it was at the end of a long rambling response
<BR>
to Waldemar, and got lost in the deluge. I wont post it again, because it's
<BR>
long; you'll have to wade through the first bit until you come to the detail
<BR>
of my idea. I hope you find it interesting, I'd love to get some comments.
<BR>
Please also note that I am not necessarily advocating this system. It's more
<BR>
that I want to demonstrate that we can think of new ways of organising,
<BR>
given the stunning communications technology we now have and are improving
<BR>
on. I believe that we should see many of the building blocks of our current
<BR>
social systems (like owning things) as more appropriate to a time almost
<BR>
past, and subject them to higher criticism than we commonly do.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Or not. Actually, I agree quite strongly with you on this Lee;
</EM><BR>
information
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; should be free. But I think this is only half the picture, because I
</EM><BR>
think
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everything should be free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Seriously. To be more precise, I think that ownership is a seriously
</EM><BR>
flawed
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; concept that damages freedom, and has created the massively unjust world
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which we now live, with a small minority of people making up the very
</EM><BR>
rich
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (that's us westerners), and the large majority of people belonging to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; legions of the mindnumbingly, incomprehensibly poor. This, because
</EM><BR>
people
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; own things, which means that others in turn are excluded from their use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can see evolutionary reasons for the rise of the concept of ownership.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not to mention that it becomes very difficult for you to use something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I'm in the process of using it...yes, some ugly little scuffles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would most likely be the quickly realized default.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I detailed in a recent post one idea for a future market economy which
</EM><BR>
did
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not include a concept of ownership (or more correctly, included the
</EM><BR>
concept
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that everyone owns everything). In that scenario, I would have
</EM><BR>
absolutely no
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problem with taking away copyright; it becomes meaningless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is very interesting. When you say everything, do you also include
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; semi- and sentient objects/collections of matter/energy? Why or why not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you think it's possible to convert from a capitalist/property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership system to your idea of an all-owner economy? Or, is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that probably would have to have been started from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginning of civilization?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you wouldn't mind Emlyn, could you please repost your idea, or you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can send it to me directly if you feel it would be unnecessary clutter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the list in general. Thanks.
