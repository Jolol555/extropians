<P>&lt;&lt; Hitler himself was NOT a capitalist, as I've said previously. He actually,
<BR>
&nbsp;according to Speer, lived quite modestly. Goering and Bormann were the two 
<BR>
big
<BR>
&nbsp;looters (and were not capitalists either), who would as a matter of practice
<BR>
&nbsp;force industrialists to pay them big kickbacks on government contracts,
<BR>
&nbsp;appropriate state funds, equipment, and land for personal use. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
He basically used the &quot;front&quot; as a modest, philosopher, deep into thought. He 
<BR>
really was indeed, the richest man in europe as of 1939, and that includes 
<BR>
the british royals. He had not only cofiscated stuff, but had contributors 
<BR>
from the German industrialists. So much, for the fellow who never carried 
<BR>
money around-that's all a myth. The nice houses at berchtishgarten, 
<BR>
continually expanded, with a u-bouat generator installed, plus several 
<BR>
headquarters, bellie adorks cultural myth. So was he a capitalist, or a leech 
<BR>
of capitalists? He sceme succeeded as far as drawing money into personal bank 
<BR>
accounts is concerned.
