<P>
I would really like to get some opinions out there about a few things
<BR>
which for me
<BR>
seem interrelated.
<BR>
<P>It all stems originally for me with the futurist pundits of yesteryear
<BR>
extolling the virtues of how the PC and later the internet decentralizes
<BR>
power, flattens hierarchies, empowers the individual.  A recent essay on
<BR>
these virtues is eloquently described by Eric Raymond's 'The Cathedral
<BR>
and the Bazaar&quot;.
<BR>
<P>1) As you may have heard Microsoft is trying very much to regain control
<BR>
by putting
<BR>
all of their software back into their central servers.  The only way
<BR>
you'll be able to use software in the future is by logging in to their
<BR>
system.  Wow, this sounds secure.  Just
<BR>
think, all those things you do on the computer - private memos,
<BR>
dictation's, dirty
<BR>
pictures, all of it will be stored and manipulated via programs you
<BR>
login into at
<BR>
Microsoft's 'Central' servers.  Regardless of anything they may claim,
<BR>
they will have
<BR>
full power to control what you see, use and do, and ultimately have all
<BR>
the tools
<BR>
necessary to collect complete dossiers on what we all use, how we're
<BR>
using it, and
<BR>
where their software is being accessed.  The old idea of liberating the
<BR>
people by
<BR>
offering them desktop computers, flattening hierarchies, decentralizing
<BR>
power will
<BR>
have been undone.  We will have returned to the old paradigm of large
<BR>
centralized
<BR>
info-warehouses with the rest of us left with nothing more than dumb
<BR>
terminals circa
<BR>
1970.  This whole thing bothers me a great deal, and for all intents and
<BR>
purposes is a
<BR>
return to Orwellian thinking with a vengeance.  What do you think?
<BR>
<P>2) In the near future, maybe within this decade, someone is going to
<BR>
create the first
<BR>
assembler.  The knowledge to create this assembler will most likely stem
<BR>
from
<BR>
rigorous research done by thousands of researchers and scientists around
<BR>
the
<BR>
world.  Its even possible that most of the design principles of this
<BR>
first assembler will have already been available on the internet via an
<BR>
ongoing open-source nanotech initiative started in the earlier part of
<BR>
this decade.  So here is the golden question - will the creator of this
<BR>
first assembler, weather it be Zyvex or some other company hold ALL the
<BR>
patent and intellectual property rights to all future assemblers based
<BR>
on their design?  Since it is likely that hundreds of other companies
<BR>
will also be able to invent their own assemblers based on previous
<BR>
research, it is likely that they will be similar enough to Zyvex's
<BR>
design, that Zyvex could you use the power of law to stop them from
<BR>
using it.  Or would it?  Is it just as likely that nanotech will be so
<BR>
powerful, that the rule of law will be quickly ignored and hundreds of
<BR>
developers will jump on the revolution anyway?  Or is there some loop
<BR>
hole in the over-sweeping Digital Millennium Copyright Act that would
<BR>
allow anyone to do it legally?  I sure hope so.  Why?  Just imagine one
<BR>
and only ONE COMPANY having sole legal power of nanotechnology.  Sine
<BR>
nanotech gives complete control over matter, the very control of matter
<BR>
itself will the be the unique power of ONE COMPANY.  Decentralized
<BR>
dreams of a nanotech paradise will be hard in coming, since one company
<BR>
will control who gets it and at what cost.  No other non-nanotech
<BR>
company could possible compete with a nanotech company producing the
<BR>
same goods.  Forget free-markets, this ONE COMPANY could very easily
<BR>
become THE ECONOMY.  Never mind the free-market that extropians wish
<BR>
for, let alone the quasi-pluralistic society we now enjoy.  Everything
<BR>
will be ONE COMPANY.  Because the longer they fight potential
<BR>
competitors through their patent rights, the longer they get ahead the
<BR>
nanotech curve, leaving any potential competitor hopelessly behind.  Is
<BR>
this what we want?.  Like Microsoft's current strategies, this potential
<BR>
outcome scares the hell out of me.  What do you think?
<BR>
<P>Looking forward to your responses,
<BR>
