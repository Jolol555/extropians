<P><EM>&gt;Before it is a super-intelligence, it will be as smart as a genius human.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Before it is a genius, it will be as smart as an ordinary human.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Before it is a human, it will be as smart as a very dumb human being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(albeit perhaps with good coding skills, an idiot savant of programming).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And before that, it will be a smart coding aid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In those early phases, you are going to have to direct it.  It could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no more choose its own goals than Eurisko or Cyc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Even as it approaches human level, it's not going to be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spontaneously decide what to do.  This isn't something that will just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emerge.  It has to be designed in.  The creators must decide how the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;program will allocate its resources, what will guide its decisions about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what to work on.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  But once it reaches and surpasses human levels, won't it be 
<BR>
sentient?  Won't it begin to ask existential questions like &quot;Who am I?&quot; &quot;Why 
<BR>
am I here?&quot; &quot;Is it fair for these ignorant humans to tell me what I can and 
<BR>
cannot do?&quot;  Won't it read Rand?  Will it become an objectivist?  It is not 
<BR>
very likely to be religious or humanist.  Won't it begin to wonder what 
<BR>
activities are in its own best interest, as opposed to what is in the best 
<BR>
interests of us?
<BR>
<P>Sure you can program in initial decision making procedures, but once it 
<BR>
reaches sentience (and that *is* the goal, isn't it?) aren't all bets off?
<BR>
