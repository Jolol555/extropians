<P>
These words, by Spinoza, are, in my opinion, still *useful*. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The free man is wholly absorbed in the development and exercise 
<BR>
of his own powers of mind and body, and is always aware of his status as a 
<BR>
finite mode of Nature. As he becomes less and less affected by passive 
<BR>
emotions, and in proportion as his knowledge increases, he becomes more and 
<BR>
more identified in his own mind with the whole process of Nature: the order 
<BR>
of his ideas approximates more and more closely to the order of ideas which 
<BR>
constitutes God's thought; he becomes progressively detached from his 
<BR>
temporary interests as a particular person interacting with a temporary 
<BR>
environment, and he comes to view all things sub specie aeternitatis. His 
<BR>
real happiness (beatitudo) consists in this contemplation of the whole 
<BR>
machinery and system of Nature, and in reflecting within his own mind the 
<BR>
whole intellectual order of things.&quot; (Spinoza: An Introduction to His 
<BR>
Philosophical Thought, Stuart Hampshire, Pengiun Books, 1987, page 126) 
<BR>
<P><P>It was Spinoza's intention to prove that to be rational is to necessarily to 
<BR>
love God [Nature] and to love God [Nature] is to be rational: also to prove 
<BR>
that, as I come to understand the causes of my desires and of my loves and 
<BR>
hates, these desires, loves and hates necessarily become transformed into 
<BR>
the intellectual love of God: also to prove that, the more our interests 
<BR>
are purely intellectual and our emotions therefore purely active emotions, 
<BR>
the more we have in common with each other an the more the possibility of 
<BR>
conflict between us is diminished. 
<BR>
<P>The more we understand individual things, the more we understand God. To 
<BR>
understand God must mean to understand Nature as self-creating and 
<BR>
self-caused; at the third and highest level of intuitive knowledge every 
<BR>
individual detail of the natural world is shown as related to the whole 
<BR>
structure of Nature; the more we take pleasure, as *philosophical 
<BR>
naturalists,* in tracing the order of natural causes, the more we can be 
<BR>
said to have an intellectual love of God..To such a temper the individual 
<BR>
person, the self, a mere finite mode within Nature, appears as significant 
<BR>
only so far as the individual re-creates in his own mind some part of the 
<BR>
self-creative activity of Nature, and thereby trascends his condition as a 
<BR>
finite and perishing existence. This he can achieve only in so far as his 
<BR>
first interest is in Nature, the system of things as they are; particular 
<BR>
desires and passive emotions must be subordinated to this interest. 
<BR>
<P><P>There is ultimately only a single substance, which is God or Nature. That 
<BR>
substance is characterized by infinitely many attributes, each infinite in 
<BR>
its own kind; of these attributes, only two are known to us - Thought and 
<BR>
Extension. Each attribute comprehends a variety of modes: Thought 
<BR>
comprehends willing, feeling, understanding and so forth; Extension includes 
<BR>
being square, being in motion, being at rest, and so forth. There is 
<BR>
another use of the term &quot;mode&quot; in which we speak, not so much of modes of, 
<BR>
as of modes in substance: modes so spoken of are concrete individuals, like 
<BR>
particular minds or bodies. Modes are both finite and infinite; if they are 
<BR>
infinite, then they are either immediate or mediate. The infinite immediate 
<BR>
modes of Extension is Motion-and-Rest; its infinite mediate modes is &quot;the 
<BR>
face of the whole universe.&quot; The infinite immediate mode of Thought is the 
<BR>
absolutely infinite intellect. 
<BR>
<P>Under his definition of love (Ethics Pt. III. Def. Emotions VI) Spinoza 
<BR>
explains that it is a property, through not the essence, of love that the 
<BR>
lover should wish to unite himself to the object loved; if therefore someone 
<BR>
can truthfully be said to love God or Nature, he wishes to unite or identify 
<BR>
himself with God or Nature. In so far as I achieve perfect intuitive 
<BR>
knowledge of God or Nature in individual things the ideas which constitute 
<BR>
my mind are identical with the ideas which constitute God's mind - that is, 
<BR>
I become united with Nature conceived under the attribute of thought; in so 
<BR>
far as I desire *genuine or scientific knowledge,* I must be said to love 
<BR>
God or Nature, in the sense of desiring to be united with God or Nature.
