<EM>&gt;Friedrich W. Nietzsche died in august 1900, the 25th.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>To me, the essence of Nietzsche is that he was a destroyer
<BR>
of the boxes within which people are intelligent.
<BR>
<P>In his attempt to destroy religious boxes, he said &quot;God is dead!&quot;
<BR>
and got his message onto the cover of Time magazine.
<BR>
<P>Many religious people are highly intelligent... within their
<BR>
religious boxes.
<BR>
<P>Max Stirner ('The Ego and its Own') was, in my opinion, a
<BR>
more penetrating box-destroyer than Nietzsche. He essentially
<BR>
said, &quot;You need to go beyond killing God, you need to destroy
<BR>
the very notion of &quot;god&quot; (so-called), the very idea of &quot;god&quot;; the
<BR>
word &quot;god&quot; needs to become no more than a nonsense-noise
<BR>
to you.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Nietzsche also attempted to destroy political boxes:
<BR>
&quot;There are still peoples and herds somewhere, but not with us,
<BR>
my brothers: here there are states.
<BR>
The state? What is that? Well then! Now open your ears, for
<BR>
now I shall speak to you of the death of peoples.
<BR>
The state is the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly it lies, too;
<BR>
and this lie creeps from its mouth; 'I, the state, am the people.'
<BR>
It is a lie! It was creators who created peoples and hung a faith
<BR>
and a love over them: thus they served life.
<BR>
It is destroyers who set snares for many and call it the state:
<BR>
they hang a sword and a hundred desires over them.
<BR>
Where a people still exists, there the people do not understand
<BR>
the state and hate it as the evil eye and sin against custom and
<BR>
law.
<BR>
I offer you this sign: every people speaks its own language of
<BR>
good and evil: its neighbor does not understand this language.
<BR>
It invented this language for itself in custom and law.
<BR>
But the state lies in all languages of good and evil; and whatever
<BR>
it says, it lies -- and whatever it has, it has stolen.
<BR>
Everything about it is false; it bites with stolen teeth. Even its
<BR>
belly is false.
<BR>
Confusion of the language of good and evil; I offer you this sign
<BR>
of the state. Truly, this sign indicates the will to death! Truly,
<BR>
it beckons to the preachers of death!
<BR>
Many too many are born: the state was invented for the
<BR>
superfluous!
<BR>
Just see how it lures them, the many-too-many! How it devours
<BR>
them, and chews them, and re-chews them!
<BR>
...It would like to range heroes and honorable men about it, this
<BR>
new idol! It likes to sun itself in the sunshine of good consciences
<BR>
-- this cold monster!
<BR>
It will give you everything if you worship it, this new idol: thus it
<BR>
buys for itself the luster of your virtues and the glance of your
<BR>
proud eyes.
<BR>
It wants to use you to lure the many-too-many. Yes, a cunning
<BR>
device of Hell has here been devised, a horse of death jingling
<BR>
with the trappings of divine honors!
<BR>
Yes, a death for many has here been devised that glorifies itself
<BR>
as life: truly a heart-felt service to all preachers of death!
<BR>
I call it the state where everyone, good and bad, is a poison-drinker:
<BR>
the state where everyone, good and bad, loses himself: the state
<BR>
where universal slow suicide is called -- life.&quot; [emphasis added]
<BR>
<P>Stirner went beyond Nietzsche and essentially said, &quot;You need to
<BR>
go beyond eliminating the State, you need to destroy the very notion
<BR>
of &quot;state&quot; (so-called), the very idea of &quot;state&quot;; the word &quot;state&quot; needs
<BR>
to become no more than a nonsense-noise to you.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Max T. O'Connor (now More) made an attempt along this theme
<BR>
in his DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF &quot;THE STATE&quot;
