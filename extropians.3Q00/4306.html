<EM>&gt; Is it possible that in order for AI to be truly successful, we're 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to give it the keys to the car?
</EM><BR>
<P>This strikes me as one of the most important questions to ask, not
<BR>
necessarily about AI in general, but about AI at the point where it
<BR>
becomes more intelligent than the most intelligent human.  
<BR>
<P>There's also the following related question:  If humans create brilliant
<BR>
&quot;offspring&quot; who can think circles around the human mind, would humans
<BR>
WANT to impose their own intellectually inferior decisions on these
<BR>
brilliant children of theirs?  
<BR>
<P>Many people, probably the majority, want to think of our species as
<BR>
continuing for many generations into the future.  If not exactly as we
<BR>
are now, then as enhanced humans, but still recognizably human.  Even
<BR>
those humans who fully expect to die within what's now considered a
<BR>
normal lifespan,  want to think of the species as continuing,  although
<BR>
logically I can't see why it would matter one way or another to someone
<BR>
who's dead (unless they expected to reincarnate within another human
<BR>
body).
<BR>
<P>I myself can't see any reason for the human species to continue in
<BR>
anything like its present form when (I should say, IF, recognizing the
<BR>
uncertain and  precarious nature of time travel [24 hours into the future
<BR>
each day]) SI becomes reality.  Is this sad?  I'm a little surprised to
<BR>
note that I don't find it particularly sad.  It's more exciting than sad.
<BR>
&nbsp;I'd be interested to know how others feel about the prospect of being
<BR>
among the last members of the human species.
