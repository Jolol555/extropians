<EM>&gt;&gt;How on Earth do they judge the significant effect size without a control

<EM>&gt;&gt;group?  Did they try having the judge check the guy's drawings against a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;randomly selected photograph as well as the target?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Here is Joe's reply. Not especially detailed, alas, but provides some sense
<BR>
of methodology. Of course, if we set off from the assumption that this *has
<BR>
to be bogus*, since known physics excludes the possibility of RV, his reply
<BR>
will look evasive. Given the formal evaluations done on the declassified
<BR>
elements of the STARGATE project by Profs Hyman and Utts (readily available
<BR>
on the net), I think such dismissal would be premature.
<BR>
<P>He comments on his claim of 55% `success rate':
<BR>
<P>==========
<BR>
That would mean &quot;average correct response&quot; about any randomly chosen target
<BR>
[location, photograph, person, event, etc.], once one has also taken into
<BR>
consideration all responses [including wrong ones for the same target].
<BR>
Usually its merit is considered only for those items that are meaningful to
<BR>
a site as regards content - not the fact that since it's outdoors it has to
<BR>
have grass present [which wouldn't be considered.] I might add, that the
<BR>
content in almost all cases is determined prior to inclusion into a common
<BR>
target pool. This also includes targets &quot;hit&quot; versus targets &quot;missed&quot;,
<BR>
missed being a function of obviously not making any connection with a target
<BR>
in the first place. And yes, it is generating any description for what could
<BR>
be anything, against chance expectations for same.
<BR>
<P>Of course I do not include here any form of targeting done outside a
<BR>
laboratory controlled environment. While those may be equally as impressive,
<BR>
they should not go towards accuracy since they were not controlled in the
<BR>
scientific sense.
