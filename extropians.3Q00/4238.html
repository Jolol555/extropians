<P>&lt;&lt; Personally, while I’d be grateful to the ants for bringing me into 
<BR>
&nbsp;existence, I doubt that I’d long be willing to enslave myself to them for 
<BR>
&nbsp;the favor. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>So you don't get along with your folks either? I personally don't discuss 
<BR>
anything much deeper than the weather with mine. But I don't consider time 
<BR>
spent with them slavery.

<P>The road from human equivalence to Power is not instantaneous. Any initial 
<BR>
post-human AI will be an information-hound. We are full of information. It'll 
<BR>
upload us like so many glazed donuts. We will become it. It will be us.
