<EM>&gt; &gt;  Thank you for wishing me well; but I must disagree with you about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  time frame.  Legal abortions appear to be in danger in the US at this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  very moment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Too true... I remember when I was about six years old, looking at Time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;magazine, horrified by a story on deaths caused by illegal abortions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Apparently as a culture, we learn nothing from history.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the things I would like to do if RU-486 is ever approved in this 
<BR>
country (and it looks like it might be soon) is to begin hoarding it (of 
<BR>
course, being male, it will probably be very difficult to get a doctor to 
<BR>
prescribe me any), and I recommend that you all do the same. Being pregnant 
<BR>
makes it easier, you could go to every doctor in town and get a 
<BR>
prescription, palm the pill (I believe the current proposed regulations 
<BR>
require taking it in the office), then have a supply later to sell or 
<BR>
donate. If feasible, people should even learn how to produce it. The reason 
<BR>
people are able to crush abortion providers with protests and the reason 
<BR>
making it illegal is (a little) more feasible then making drugs illegal is 
<BR>
because of the model by which it is carried out. There's a building, clearly 
<BR>
labeled and known about, where you have to go to get one, and this building 
<BR>
makes itself a target for protests and violence. There are people who 
<BR>
perform the abortions who become targets of fanatics for harrassment and 
<BR>
sometimes violence.
<BR>
Now imagine how much better it would be if you could order an abortion over 
<BR>
the internet, and the pill comes in the mail a week later.
<BR>
Does anyone know of any overseas locations which provide RU-486?
<BR>
If people were aware of this possibility and it were talked about, I think 
<BR>
things would begin to settle into place for an illegal RU-486 market. Maybe 
<BR>
I'll place an RU-486 auction on ebay to get some press.
