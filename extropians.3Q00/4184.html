<P><EM>&gt;We as extropians may have been exactly wrong about one thing:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our notion that greater freedom comes from having freedom from religion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perhaps we need *more* religions, lots of different ones, lots of them that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are mutually exclusive!  That way, people can get all the religious fixes
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;humans seem to need, yet there is plenty of evidence for anyone who cares
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to see, that these ridiculous notions cannot *all* be true, but they
</EM><BR>
definitely
<BR>
<EM>&gt;*can* all be wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Let us encourage all religions, and hope none of them get more popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than the others, so there are a jillion little churches, all fighting for
</EM><BR>
market
<BR>
<EM>&gt;share.  &quot;You guys worship buddha, you other guys worship yhwh, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over there worship cucumbers...&quot;  All with different rules of moral conduct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and none with a majority.  Welcome them all, and offer an alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for those who see the madness of it all.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is very similar to the future libertarian world I envision. I use the
<BR>
analogy of a vast ocean dotted by island chains. The ocean is the
<BR>
libertarian main part of society; the islands are the enclaves in which
<BR>
people live according to the rules of their religion or ideology that
<BR>
differs from the main part.
<BR>
<P>On those islands, people would be free to stay or to move to the main. While
<BR>
they stay on the island, they can allow their freedoms to be limited
<BR>
according to the precepts of the cult they have joined. Once they leave,
<BR>
they are free.
<BR>
<P>Some people might object that these islands could be highly repressive, and
<BR>
that children born there could not leave. That is so. But this would only
<BR>
affect individuals temporarily - children eventually grow up -- so long as
<BR>
there is freedom of movement (which could be maintained via the ID implant
<BR>
and regular checking to see if any individual wished to move).
<BR>
<P>Ironically, the main libertarian society would probably have to maintain
<BR>
something of a social safety net (limited welfare system) to assist people
<BR>
who leave the enclaves and have no economic resources of their own upon
<BR>
their arrival in freedom. But that would be a small price to pay, I think,
<BR>
so long as the assistance was limited in time and kept low enough to be
<BR>
undesirable as a long-term lifestyle.
<BR>
