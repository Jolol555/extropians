<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't take Paul's critique to be a call for more government programs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Most of what he (and others in the thread) criticizes IS government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The DMCA is a government law.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for clarifying the issue and hopefully getting this thread back on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; track.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Although Paul mostly points at big business as being the root cause,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; obviously this is not the case because states that have eliminated big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; business have at least as much trouble with corruption and unfairness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I don't see big business as the root cause.  The problem I see is a lack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of free-market ideas and/or constraints that would prevent the top 50% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealthy from ruling over the bottom 50%.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, How are you measuring your percentages? I'm under the impression that the
<BR>
top 5% own 50% of everything, and the top 50% own 90% of everything already.
<BR>
What sort of private mechanisms would prevent the disowned 50% from being pushed
<BR>
around and abused?
<BR>
<P>The principle that rights, morals, and ethics are for sale does work here. If a
<BR>
society can afford to free its slaves, it generally will. If the average family
<BR>
has ten kids, that society can afford to see more of its youth killed in warfare
<BR>
than a society where the average family has one or two kids. Its not an accident
<BR>
that as family size decreased, the rationale for the draft fell by the wayside,
<BR>
as families with fewer kids could not emotionally afford to lose them to combat
<BR>
as previous generations had. With the Cold War in the 50's, national security
<BR>
was more valuable than workplace safety, and as a result, many nuclear workers
<BR>
were exposed and the evidence hidden in secrecy.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps my memory is incorrect, but as I recall Paul, you've stated your own
<BR>
beleif in Mao's maxim that 'justice comes from the barrel of a gun'. I fail to
<BR>
see how the alternative, that justice comes from a wallet, could possibly be
<BR>
worse in any way. It is, IMHO, far better, rather.
<BR>
<P>Current day activism, like rtmark, ruckus, etc. is in fact a free-market
<BR>
solution to government enforcement. An informed population of consumers is
<BR>
necessary for activism of any kind to be effective. Dolphin safe tuna would not
<BR>
have resulted unless everyday people actually cared about dolphins. Its the
<BR>
upper classes that actually practice a far higher level of ethical consumerism
<BR>
than the lower classes do. Poor people don't recycle. They don't do 'adopt a
<BR>
highway' unless its part of the sentencing for their criminal conviction. They
<BR>
can't afford to take the day off to go protest. The only activism that poor
<BR>
people engage in is that which impacts them directly, i.e. union strikes or
<BR>
local issues. In a more free market scenario, activists would operate consumer
<BR>
awareness sites (like Consumer Reports from Consumers Union)
