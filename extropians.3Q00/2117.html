[Non-member submission]
<BR>
<P>Space-borne protective energy systems, like the deflector shields on the
<BR>
fictional starship U.S.S. Voyager, are on the drawing board of
<BR>
real-world scientists.
<BR>
These &quot;cold plasmas&quot; -- analogs to the sophisticated defensive grids
<BR>
envisioned by Star Trek's creators -- are ambient-temperature, ionized
<BR>
gases related to those found deep within the sun's core.
<BR>
Such plasmas are capable of shielding satellites and other spacecraft;
<BR>
or making them invisible to radars; or both. Nor will they fry
<BR>
electronics or melt metal.
<BR>
On Earth, cold plasmas should permit rapid, room-temperature
<BR>
sterilization of food, medical equipment and contaminated civilian and
<BR>
military gear. Low-temperature plasmas could one day also make possible
<BR>
an entire new generation of miniature lasers and ultra-low-energy
<BR>
fluorescent light tubes.
<BR>
While scientists have known of low-temperature plasmas since at least
<BR>
the end of the 19th century, only within the past several years have
<BR>
techniques emerged to make cold plasma generation practical.
<BR>
Vaulting to the first ranks of cold-plasma research in the last three
<BR>
years has been soft-spoken, unassuming Tunisian native Mounir Laroussi,
<BR>
an electrical and computer engineer at Old Dominion University in
<BR>
Norfolk, Va. Research groups at Stanford, Princeton, Ohio State,
<BR>
Wisconsin and New York Polytechnic also are conducting their own
<BR>
plasma-research programs.
<BR>
Laroussi has literally put plasma on the table: devising an apparatus
<BR>
that creates a mini-plasma inside a plexiglass cube by passing an
<BR>
electric current through helium gas via specially calibrated electrodes.
<BR>
Laroussi's process, specified in pending patent applications, is
<BR>
scalable; cold-plasma containers of virtually any size are feasible. No
<BR>
vacuum pumps are required, since the plasma is generated at normal
<BR>
atmospheric pressure.
<BR>
&quot;Mounir is on the forefront. He's one of the pioneers,&quot; said Igor
<BR>
Alexeff, president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
<BR>
Engineer's Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society and professor emeritus of
<BR>
electrical engineering at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
<BR>
&quot;He's pushing very hard to develop a variety of practical plasmas. His
<BR>
work is pretty impressive.&quot;
<BR>
Invulnerable and invisible
<BR>
The U.S. Air Force allocates some $10 million a year for research geared
<BR>
toward satellite protection. Of that amount, $2 million is dedicated to
<BR>
low-temperature plasma studies.
<BR>
Robert Barker, program manager for plasma physics in the Air Force's
<BR>
Office of Scientific Research in Arlington, Va. is so taken with
<BR>
Laroussi's approach that he thus far has funneled $250,000 into
<BR>
Laroussi's research since his arrival at Old Dominion from the
<BR>
University of Tennessee a little over a year ago. The Air Force has
<BR>
supported Laroussi's work since 1996.
<BR>
Barker is drawn not just by Laroussi's plasma-creating prowess, but his
<BR>
ability to make low-temperature plasma inexpensively, in bulk and
<BR>
without the need for hulking equipment.
<BR>
&quot;What's intriguing about Mounir's work is the large volumes of plasma
<BR>
he's been able to generate,&quot; Barker said. &quot;He's making very good
<BR>
progress in keeping costs and weight low. His approach gives the best
<BR>
power figures for practical, large-volume generation of cold plasma we
<BR>
have to date.&quot;
<BR>
Power-hungry plasmas
<BR>
Poke a finger inside Laroussi's tabletop plasma-generating apparatus and
<BR>
all you'll get from the bluish, pilot-light-like ionized gas is a slight
<BR>
tingle. But the harmless sensation is misleading, since it doesn't give
<BR>
a complete picture of plasma's power. Depending on how a plasma is
<BR>
&quot;tuned,&quot; or how it is made more dense by increasing its frequency, it
<BR>
could ward off microwave bursts and discharges from ground-based,
<BR>
energized sources of potential damage and disruption.
<BR>
Swirling in and around one another, a plasma's charged particles
<BR>
interact constantly, giving rise to localized attractions or repulsions.
<BR>
External energy splashing against the plasma --- say, from a potentially
<BR>
disabling, concentrated burst of microwaves, or perhaps even from
<BR>
certain varieties of particle-beam weapons fired from military bases on
<BR>
Earth --- could be caught up within the plasma's complex electromagnetic
<BR>
fields and dissipated completely or deflected into space.
<BR>
Hotter plasmas, while dense, don't appear immediately practical as a
<BR>
defensive shield because of destructive temperatures and high power
<BR>
requirements. In theory, cold plasmas can be made more dense, but like
<BR>
their hotter kin will demand more power. Energy availability and weight
<BR>
--- the larger the required wattage, the heavier the equipment --- would
<BR>
remain thorny issues.
<BR>
&quot;In theory, a plasma could deflect a particle beam or laser attack,&quot;
<BR>
Laroussi says. &quot;It depends on what you're shooting at it and how high
<BR>
you can tune the plasma frequency. That doesn't mean it's easy or
<BR>
practically achievable, particularly with a cold plasma. It's a tough
<BR>
requirement to meet at present.&quot;
<BR>
Cloaking mirrors
<BR>
A nearer-term application is cloaking. With the proper adjustments, a
<BR>
plasma can be made into a kind of energy mirror, reflecting back or away
<BR>
incoming electromagnetic waves, such as those emitted from ground-based
<BR>
radars. In essence, any spacecraft outfitted with this kind of plasma
<BR>
field would be completely cloaked from the probing attentions of radar
<BR>
operators.
<BR>
&quot;The idea is to deflect or absorb the energy completely,&quot; Laroussi said.
<BR>
&quot;If you absorb the energy --- completely dissipating it within the
<BR>
plasma --- the radar doesn't see anything. Nothing reflects back.&quot;
<BR>
Light but potent
<BR>
Lofting payloads into space must currently observe one of the Space
<BR>
Age's key commandants: Make nothing so heavy that it must cost much to
<BR>
launch.
<BR>
Any on-board plasma-generation equipment would therefore have to be
<BR>
small and lightweight. Laroussi's gear seems to fit the bill: compact
<BR>
enough to save on weight, yet powerful enough to produce the necessary
<BR>
plasma volume.
<BR>
But don't expect completely impervious shields anytime soon. Any number
<BR>
of technical issues remains to be solved, not the least of which is
<BR>
exactly how to make cold plasmas dense enough to withstand attack. The
<BR>
ultimate --- protection against projectiles or lasers --- is likely
<BR>
decades away, at best.
<BR>
&quot;Ablative shields made of solid material might work,&quot; said the Air
<BR>
Force's Barker. &quot;A portion of the solid would be converted to plasma
<BR>
[when hit]. But In a strict sense, I don't consider that plasma
<BR>
shielding.&quot;
<BR>
Star wars defense
<BR>
Less immediately space-like, but no less practical, are biological
<BR>
applications. Cold plasmas allow for rapid decontamination of clothing,
<BR>
equipment or personal gear. In disrupting the integrity of cell
<BR>
membranes, the plasmas appear to offer a rapid, simple and inexpensive
<BR>
means of destroying even the hardiest bacterial spores. At present,
<BR>
sterilization time can run hours; use of a cold plasma could sanitize in
<BR>
mere minutes.
<BR>
Should this application pan out, it could offer to hospitals and armies
<BR>
alike a safe and reliable way to counteract potential health hazards,
<BR>
either those posed by disease or in combat. Likewise, exobiologists
<BR>
might rest easy knowing that cold plasmas could remove the potential
<BR>
threat of contamination from collected interplanetary samples returned
<BR>
to Earth's surface.
<BR>
Still, it's hard to vanquish all the SF combat scenarios. Plasmas may be
<BR>
one of the best defensive options as offensive capabilities continue a
<BR>
rapid and relentless advance.
<BR>
&quot;This Star Wars stuff is coming,&quot; said Igor Alexeff. &quot;Laser and
<BR>
high-power microwave weapons are on the way; they're almost here. Lasers
<BR>
are fierce weapons. To protect against them, you'd need a very dense
<BR>
plasma, almost a solid. But a good cold plasma could really help out by
<BR>
reflecting or absorbing energy from a microwave war weapon.&quot;
