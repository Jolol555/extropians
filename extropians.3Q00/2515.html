<P>
There's an article by John Gilmore on the nanodot board at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://nanodot.org/articles/00/07/27/2219252.shtml">http://nanodot.org/articles/00/07/27/2219252.shtml</A> which looks at
<BR>
the IP debate in the context of future nanotech.
<BR>
<P>Jason Joel Thompson has pointed out here that nanotech may eventually
<BR>
make it possible to cheaply create material objects given information
<BR>
about their designs, in which case most of the economy would involve
<BR>
trading intellectual property.  IP issues will therefore become ever
<BR>
more important as we move to an era where the only thing that matters
<BR>
is information.
<BR>
<P>Jason's perspective is that this will be a disaster if we don't have a
<BR>
way to protect ownership of IP, and therefore we should come up with
<BR>
institutions today that protect the forms of IP that we have now, so
<BR>
that in the future we will be able to have a functioning economy.
<BR>
<P>The article by John Gilmore follows much the same reasoning, but comes to
<BR>
exactly the opposite conclusion.  John, like Jason, sees today's threats
<BR>
to IP as portending a future society where all productive efforts will
<BR>
face similar forms of piracy.  Rather than fighting this trend, though,
<BR>
he seeks ways to live with it.
<BR>
<P>John made one of his many fortunes through his company Cygnus Solutions,
<BR>
one of the first businesses to make money off of &quot;free software&quot;.
<BR>
Cygnus sold versions of the Gnu development tools (compilers, debuggers,
<BR>
etc.), packaged for various architectures, along with technical support.
<BR>
This is the same basic business model used by RedHat and some other
<BR>
companies today, but Gilmore started it almost 20 years ago.
<BR>
<P>His experience no doubt teaches him that you *can* make money off of
<BR>
software which is given away for free; the millions of dollars in his
<BR>
bank account attest to that.
<BR>
<P>John suggests that if we don't solve the IP problem, the advent of
<BR>
nanotech will lead to exactly the kind of disaster Jason is predicting:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotech threatens to apply the same economics to physical goods --
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very cheap copying after relatively expensive creation. If our economy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not to crash immediately after assemblers arrive (resulting in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many hungry people rioting or warring), society needs to learn how to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structure an economy to support the expensive part while letting the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheap part provide its benefits of broad distribution of the results.
<BR>
<P>However, he believes that the efforts by the RIAA and other copyright
<BR>
owners to preserve antiquated IP laws will only make matters worse:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual property law, and expected business practice, is being
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driven by the entertainment middleman industry in exactly the wrong
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direction: Artificially restricting computers and citizens so that they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not make the copies that they are very good at making. Following
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this path will lead the economy to a massive dislocation (much
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bigger than the record companies' dismay about Napster and MP3 --
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record companies' sales today are greater than ever). Almost nobody
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understands this yet.
<BR>
<P>The solution he sees is to move society towards acceptance of the open
<BR>
source philosophy in all areas of human endeavor.  Only in that way can
<BR>
we move into a nanotech economy without a crash, and allowing everyone to
<BR>
share in the fruits of the new technology:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If even a third or a half of the economy is running on open source
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principles before assemblers start assembling more assemblers, we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can probably avoid war and worldwide civil unrest.
<BR>
<P>John says that much of his interest in the open source software movement
<BR>
and IP issues in general is because of his concerns about the transition
<BR>
to nanotech.  I wonder how long ago he realized that his business model
<BR>
could play such a significant role in the future economy.
