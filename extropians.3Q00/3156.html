<P>
I changed my surname when I got married, to my wife's name (quick primer for
<BR>
newer arrivals; I'm a man).
<BR>
<P>Changing your name is a good experience. The funniest thing you note is
<BR>
people reacting to you differently. I changed my surname from Evans to
<BR>
O'Regan, and suddenly people (who hadn't known me before) were pointing out
<BR>
all the Irish characteristics I possessed.
<BR>
<P>However, I would never change my name to something easier to spell, or
<BR>
pronounce, or to anything more common. One of the best assets you can have
<BR>
these days, in the massively crammed namespace of the net, is a weird name.
<BR>
<P>I've noticed it with my first name since I was a knee high to a grasshopper.
<BR>
People remember me when I'm in a list of names; it means I get slightly more
<BR>
personal treatment for no good reason. Job interviews are a particular case
<BR>
in point; I introduce myself as Emlyn, and people say &quot;ah yes, I remember
<BR>
your application&quot;, because they notice the name. Another thing I like is
<BR>
that people immediately assume I am going to be a bit eccentric, which is
<BR>
lucky.
<BR>
<P>If someone has to ask you to spell your name, or makes the gaff of mistaking
<BR>
you for the opposite gender, you've got it made. They will not forget you.
<BR>
<P>I've got a good friend, with a weird name; I've known him since our parents
<BR>
lived in a group house together when I was 1 and he was just newly popped. I
<BR>
lost him in the last year; we both move around a lot and don't talk that
<BR>
often, different cities, so none of the contact details I had for him were
<BR>
correct. I couldn't even find him in a phone book, because he's always in
<BR>
group houses; never has the phone in his name.
<BR>
<P>I jumped onto ICQ the other day and looked him up. Only one person existed
<BR>
in the world with that name; it was him. He told me he had lost my details
<BR>
too; we might never have found each other again if not for that name.
<BR>
<P>My wife &amp; I chose the name Lachlan for our new son (three months old now). I
<BR>
didn't realise it was such a popular name! Luckily, I found the spelling
<BR>
Lochlainn (which we have used instead), it's irish, matches the surname, and
<BR>
will cause him hell with spelling it out to people forever. But, it'll stand
<BR>
out. As soon as someone thinks &quot;how do I pronounce this&quot;, they've thought
<BR>
about you, and will remember you.
<BR>
<P>A good test of appropriate name weirdness: If you can find a name you've
<BR>
chosen on any off-the-shelf &quot;personalised&quot; merchandise (you know, mugs,
<BR>
badges, those dumb plaques for your bedroom door), then the name is no good;
<BR>
try again.
<BR>
<P>I can't say much about the outrunning of embarrassing posts; I'm still busy
<BR>
posting them. I wouldn't worry; people understand you change, and it
<BR>
demonstrates that you learn. Fewer people do learn than one might think;
<BR>
it's a good thing to be able to prove!
<BR>
<P>Much of life is about standing out from a crowd. Any edge you can get is a
<BR>
bonus. This is not a good time to be called &quot;John&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Emlyn
<BR>
(apologies in advance to the &quot;John&quot;s)

Subject: Re: Reintroduction
<BR>
<P><P>I've been thinking of switching recently - either to my middle name, or
<BR>
to something completely new, like &quot;Ben Abard&quot;.  (Short, easy to spell,
<BR>
and close to the beginning of the alphabet.)
<BR>
<P>Partially this is because my current name is so hard to pronounce.  But
<BR>
the other reason is a harsh necessity for all children of the digital
<BR>
age...
<BR>
<P>...outrunning the posts you made when you were fourteen.
