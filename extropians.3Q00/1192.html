<EM>&gt; The antibiotics killed off most of the tuberculosis population, leaving only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the resistent forms.  The resistent forms do not die when given most forms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antibiotics, and they have increased among the poor people in the USA.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give reason for some concern. The war against tuberculosis continues.
</EM><BR>
<P>If this were so, it would be spread relatively evenly among the poor in the USA.
<BR>
It is not, much like half of the remaining 2500 cases of syphyllis in the US are
<BR>
found in only 25 counties in the US, they persist due to memes of stubborn
<BR>
ignorance, fear of doctors and health care, insistence on perpetuating behaviors
<BR>
that continue to spread the disease and a refusal to take medicines as directed.
<BR>
Most recurring TB patients never take the entire regimen of antibiotics they are
<BR>
directed to, they only take them until they feel better.
<BR>
<P>TB patients who are cured with anti-biotics if it is caught in time are clean of
<BR>
the bacteria, but are sufficiently scarred in the lungs that it becomes easy for
<BR>
them to be reinfected at the next exposure.
