</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Umm, US laws don't generally permit this type of thing, I think,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though I'm not 100% positive.  Certainly my brokerages wanted a *lot*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of information about me, including IRS good standing.  I guess there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be some that do it, but I think the SEC would take a dim view.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually it is quite possible for foreigners to open accounts at US
<BR>
brokerages. I know Datek for instance allows it. I'm not saying it
<BR>
would be a piece of cake, but it would be possible I think.

<EM>&gt; &gt; ... transfer your profits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; occasionally back to the bank account, and from there to your US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bank account. You could tell the IRS you don't know who these magic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; payments come from, perhaps a secret admirer :-) And voila, no more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capital gains taxes.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then, even worse, it's income!  Even if it's an anoymous gift (yeah,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right, the IRS believes that) you still owe income taxes on it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Income taxes are worse than capital gains taxes for non-trivial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incomes.  At least with regular capital gains they're exempt from any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income taxes, municipal, state or federal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually short term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as income.
<BR>
Imagine you had $10,000,000 to play with. You're a short term trader
<BR>
looking to maximize your profits over a year. You trade in and out of
<BR>
stocks perhaps as often as every few days. If you have to pay the IRS
<BR>
for the gains on each of those trades, it is going to be a heckuva lot
<BR>
of money. And let's say twice a year you wire yourself anonymously just
<BR>
enough money to live on, and keep investing the rest. You are going to
<BR>
pay far far less tax, and that money will snowball into a huge number
<BR>
quite a bit more quickly (assuming of course you're a good trader :-).
<BR>
<P>P.S. many states also tax capital gains at the income rate.
