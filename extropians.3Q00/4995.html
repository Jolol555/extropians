<EM>&gt; You can't say this to me... you thought I was a VB programmer (oh the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shame)!  And you were going to slap me, geez, I've got my eye on you. Never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; turn your back on a slapper.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>The slap is only metaphorical and perhaps verbal if I see another fine
<BR>
mind going to waste.  We all need slaps like that occassionally. 
<BR>
Self-administered works too.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Well, I'm not a VB programmer, but I'm still seriously underqualified to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than rant vaguely about genetic programming. Eugene has a passing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; familiarity with this stuff; got a status report on state-of-the-art for us?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too.  But I do have some ideas about what needs to be done to
<BR>
organize/enable the component database that such a system would draw
<BR>
elements from.  Those ideas spin off quite a few tools and techniques
<BR>
that are generally useful and could be financially rewarding along the
<BR>
way.  And I've stuck a toe or two into some intentional programming
<BR>
stuff about how systems could be specified.   Some hard problems involve
<BR>
the proper classification of components and semantic descriptions of
<BR>
their properties and contextual expectations. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm a bit afraid that the business plan would look something like:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     1 - Get lots o money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     2 - Spend lots o money doing heaps of cool research into genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programming, play around with oh so excellent equipment, discover some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excellent stuff, have a bloody fantastic time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     3 - Run out of money with no products/market to show for it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     4 - get a slapping (eek) from the VC(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     5 - Reputation in ruins, become a tramp, scavenge in bins, waiting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>0 - promise we will live on bread and water while spending lots of money
<BR>
to make our stock holders wealthy beyond their dreams of avarice...
<BR>
<P>Sounds like a great plan to me.  At the least we get to have a good time
<BR>
trying and maybe produce some seeds that the next effort can start
<BR>
from.  Many of the big-rep people in Silly-Con Valley have had at least
<BR>
one venture blow up in their face.  Failure is a learning experience as
<BR>
long as it doesn't kill you.
