<P><EM> &gt; It seems to me pretty silly to simply scale up humans as they are today
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and give them godlike abilities to be super-duper apes instead of merely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; slightly evolved ones.  You won't sell much progress if that is the way
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems to be pretty silly to assume we all silently transcend into a
<BR>
society of homogenous gods, to sit in the virtual Pantheon until the
<BR>
Universe's clock runs out (or forever, if we find some new physics).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; of it.  Fortunately, changing ourselves is also massively enabled. 
</EM><BR>
<P>So we have a vastly expanded scope of modifications, and we all
<BR>
synchronously restrict us to just a few? Is your list of mods same as
<BR>
mine? You guarantee the population of independent agents iterating
<BR>
such mods (and replicating the old-fashioned way) will never drift
<BR>
apart? From the space of all possibilities, that is not exactly one of
<BR>
more probable outcomes.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Also, reproduction is much less turned to when they are a variety of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; other interesting things to do even among mere mortals.  Lastly,
</EM><BR>
<P>Last time I looked a subpopulation of humanity was surprisingly fecund
<BR>
&lt;insert favourite minorities joke here&gt;. And not even counting the
<BR>
nonhumanity, which doesn't care a fig about philosophy of Plato.
<BR>
<P>Again, you extrapolate from a snapshot.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; physical reproduction and all physical processes of incorporating
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; physical materials are governed by physical speed limits.  Not by how
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; fast the AI can run.  Trillions of human beings simply cannot be
</EM><BR>
<P>Who talks about AI? It's me, and my brother John, and his wife Jane,
<BR>
and their children, and their dog, and...
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; produced in &quot;a few hours&quot;.  Building tools and transport and disposal
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's see, I have the Earth surface covered with a 1 cm deep layer of
<BR>
molecular circuitry (one can do that, though probably in a bit more
<BR>
than a few hours). A human occupies a space the size of 1 cm^3, or an
<BR>
orange, whatever. It takes 1 ms to copy a single human. Even assuming
<BR>
we can only spread by direct contact as a wave in a 2d medium (instead
<BR>
of beaming to different foci of nucleation, or physically launch the
<BR>
blocks with hypersonic speed), there are quite a lot of milliseconds
<BR>
in a few hours. And an average space rock made of carbonaceous
<BR>
chondrite has a lot of these cubic centimeters (or oranges), and can
<BR>
be fractally shredded very quickly.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; units and processing the entire solar system simply is not the work of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;a few hours&quot;.  Even if you could get all of the sentient beings
</EM><BR>
<P>We're talking about Earth surface, not the entire solar system. The
<BR>
solar system will take a little longer, especially if we consider the
<BR>
material trapped in the gravitation wells, which has a kinetical
<BR>
accessibility bottleneck. Unless you apply a lot of muscle, or funky
<BR>
new physics.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; involved to agree, which is extremely doubtful.  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated. Do you really think the
<BR>
development will be magically held in it's track, until everybody (the
<BR>
Pope, the Amish, my grandmother) agrees? &lt;insert polite snicker here&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; [sysop stuff snipped]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Your scenario assumes we all will want to go onto the chips, to live
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; inside of VR space.  While that looks largely attractive in many ways I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; would also expect to have the option to form external, &quot;real-world&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; bodies and extensions to do &quot;real-world&quot; work and gain a different level
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of experiences. Some other beings will not wish to ever make a home in
</EM><BR>
<P>I want to have a km of pristine real beach to me alone. Uh, I can't
<BR>
afford it. You want *what*? A slowtime flesh body? You must be really
<BR>
rich, and suicidal, risking losing touch with where the action is.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; VR land.  If the AI respects us it will need to make some room for our
</EM><BR>
<P>Artificial reality takes a lot of hardware to run. Because artificial
<BR>
reality is more compact and efficient than real reality, and provided
<BR>
no one will come and eat the hardware from under your virtual feet, it
<BR>
is not obvious that you will have an interesting physical world for
<BR>
your activities. Private property signs everywhere.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; choices (within reason).  I am not sure how it will establish its Pax
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; SysOp without doing violence to at least parts of humanity.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The sysop thing is inviable, sure.
