Hmmmm, should I be grinning here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Robert, if you practise LE type &quot;supplementation&quot; would it be possible for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you to post your regime privately to people who might be interested??
</EM><BR>
<P>I used to be fairly rigorous about this but I pay much less attention
<BR>
to it now than I used to because I think the curve is moving fast
<BR>
enough for it to make little difference to me personally.
<BR>
<P>However you should keep in mind that I may be wrong and I'm
<BR>
crazy enough that I like to &quot;live on the edge&quot; just to keep
<BR>
life interesting (I get bored too easily).
<BR>
<P>All that said, the stuff I think is important is a general purpose
<BR>
multivitamin (without iron for men).  I'm partial to Twinlabs.
<BR>
I'm also fond of CoQ10 and Lipoic acid for your mitochondria
<BR>
and think Carnitine is useful.
<BR>
<P>There are also some interesting arguments that you should throw
<BR>
yourself into a sauna/steam room every couple of days
<BR>
(activating your heat shock response to refold proteins)
<BR>
and periodically fast or eat meals deficient in some of the
<BR>
essential amino acids every couple of days (as a pseudo-CR
<BR>
strategy to force protein recycling to shift the ratio
<BR>
of new(good) vs. bad(old, potentially defective) proteins).
<BR>
<P>However I rapidly get lost with all the stuff people talk about
<BR>
now-a-days, esp. the smart drugs.  My general experience in the past
<BR>
was that I noticed little personal difference with many things that
<BR>
others rave about.  I suspect that my general physiology is less
<BR>
sensitive to most of this stuff or I'm mentally less generally aware
<BR>
of my body &amp; mind than the average person.  Given that, it doesn't 
<BR>
seem to make much sense to play around with the various things
<BR>
until general population genotyping can be done and I know what
<BR>
polymorphisms I do/don't have so I can correlate those with
<BR>
probable drug effects.
<BR>
<P>I think there is going to be a wealth of interesting stuff that
<BR>
people will be able to do once we understand the regulation
<BR>
of things like iron &amp; copper transport &amp; DNA repair a bit better.
<BR>
