<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; That is an arguable point.  Can you give me examples of how the value of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; timeliness and authenticity are decreasing with technology, or why they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reasonably should?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Timeliness is the value of producing content at a particular point in time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This ability is simply technological-- that is to say, it is not something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I own by virtue of having the idea.  If your product is not protected,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then I can equal or exceed your timeliness. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't understand this at all.  The author has a complete natural
<BR>
monopoly on timeliness, and no amount of technology will ever change
<BR>
that.  Even if I could completely replicate a performance and retransmit
<BR>
it in realtime, I cannot, for example, make a promise to perform a work
<BR>
at any certain time until after a creator has already done so, nor can I
<BR>
promise to create a work for hire to specifications that I don't
<BR>
personally have the talent to create.  A man like Sting /can/
<BR>
contractually promise to create a work of a certain quality and deliver
<BR>
it at a certain time.  No copier will ever be able to do that.  This
<BR>
can be used to sell either work-for-hire or performance.  Yes, many
<BR>
people will not buy performances and choose to listen to retransmissions
<BR>
of the events instead--assuming such technical means exist (and I'm not
<BR>
at all conceding this--exclusion technologies and contracts /will/ exist
<BR>
and they /will/ work at least as well if not better than exclusion laws).
<BR>
But none of that contradicts the fact that timeliness /is/ valuable and
<BR>
/can/ be marketed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Authenticity is a murky concept.  It pretty much refers to something being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;real deal.&quot;  Clearly, our ability to copy information digitally (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly) eliminates this concept. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Only after we're able to perfectly duplicate people.  Until then, there
<BR>
will still be only one me and only one you, and whatever economic value
<BR>
our names and reputations carry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The reason we like authenticity is that it has traditionally been an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicator of us having an assurance of the quality and nature of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we were getting-- an irrelevant concept if I have a digitally perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copy of that product.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's true.  Authenticity, then, needs to be marketed not so much as
<BR>
a guarantor of quality, then, as a guarantor of things like timeliness
<BR>
and personal service.  The millionth copy of Windows 2000 is of 100%
<BR>
equal to the quality of the first, as you correctly point out.  But you
<BR>
can only call a tech support staff personally trained by the same team
<BR>
that created the product if you have an authentic copy.  This model is
<BR>
more difficult for music, but there are still personal services, timely
<BR>
performances, and such that can make it work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My perfect instaneous superbowl broadcast possesses precisely every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trait as your broadcast of significance to the end user.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, that's a good example.  Broadcasts of what are essentially accounts
<BR>
of public events will be as impossible to control as news gathered from
<BR>
ubiquitous cameras.  But that's OK, because there's no creative effort
<BR>
there to protect.  NBC didn't &quot;author&quot; the superbowl, so why /should/
<BR>
they get to control distribution of its broadcast?  They created the
<BR>
commentary, perhaps, so they might be able to make money, say, by having
<BR>
John Madden personally answer questions over email during the game or
<BR>
something, but you're right that the broadcast itself has little to
<BR>
gain from authenticity (except as a guarantor of its ability to answer
<BR>
those timely questions, or provide timely insightful announcement, etc.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Okay, now you start a genuinely interesting discussion with regard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; novelty for its own sake and gradual refinements, etc.  I hope my bias is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not showing too strongly here, but I consider this to be the *real*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion because it looks at what the selection processes are and has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas about how we might improve them.  I believe that -everything- will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual property eventually--your automobile will just be a piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software I give to my nanoassemblers--so I am consequently more interested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in discussing how we can improve the process of intellectual innovation than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am in why we should remove it's ownership protection.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree here 100%.  After nanotech, all manufacturing becomes software.
<BR>
All the more reason to avoid the legal morass of copyright for the simpler
<BR>
commitment to freedom before we get there and have a population of 50%
<BR>
copyright and patent lawyers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I also won't argue with what someone else makes up in his mind about what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have said, rather than arguing with what I've /actually/ said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it's disingenuous of you to suggest that your argument has not been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in favor of direct payment for the production and distribution of product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and in favor of the elimination of direct payment for intellectual capital.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not only suggesting that I've said that--I'm telling you that that's
<BR>
exactly what I've said in plain English and I don't appreciate being
<BR>
told otherwise.  I absolutely, completely, 100%, support the idea of
<BR>
being paid for intellectual work, and I'm growing very tired of having
<BR>
to say that again and again.  What I oppose, and what I've been very
<BR>
clear about (and which you haven't adressed in your replies) is the
<BR>
idea that getting paid for one's intellectual work gives one the further
<BR>
right to interfere with someone else benefiting from the work as well.
<BR>
I want /everyone/ who can figure out how to make money with any idea to
<BR>
be able to do so.  You want to restrict this right only to the creator
<BR>
of the idea (however nebulously that might be defined), presumably
<BR>
because you think /all/ of the potential marketable value of any
<BR>
creative work is a necessary incentive to create it.  I think you
<BR>
devalue intellectual work to much.  Not only should a creator be able
<BR>
to live well on a small part of any work's total economic potential,
<BR>
but it is physically impossible for one person to fully realize any
<BR>
idea's monetary potential.  No person, no matter how creative, can
<BR>
possibly imagine all the ways to make money from an idea he has
<BR>
created that others might find if given access to the idea.  I think
<BR>
it is /my/ position that is more consistent and in line with the ideals
<BR>
of a capitalist free market, not yours. 
<BR>
<P>To return briefly to the matter/pattern distiction, yes, I think it
<BR>
would be interesting and useful if there were a way for more than one
<BR>
person to make money from a piece of matter as well, rather than just
<BR>
restricting that right to the owner.  But the nature of matter throws
<BR>
a monkey wrench in that idea, because matter can't be shared or
<BR>
copied.  Therefore, we must have some allocation strategy that tends
<BR>
to ensure it is used as efficiently as possible.  The idea of assigning
<BR>
ownership, and allowing owners to trade and rent is one method of doing
<BR>
that, and the best one I've seen so far.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree that the demand will increase, but why should people spend any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effort looking for more ingenious ways to pay for having them created?  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got a very simple solution for those people.  Just pay for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>And that's exactly what they'll do.  You want something far more than
<BR>
that, though: you want people to (1) pay for the idea to be created,
<BR>
and (2) pay for thugs to prevent anyone but the creator from also
<BR>
exploiting the idea for profit.  Make no mistake--copyright is about
<BR>
the use of force to restrain free trade in ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let's determine what type of 'freedom' you're talking about here, shall we?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope you won't accuse me of putting words in your mouth if I infer that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you mean by freedom here is really &quot;the freedom to copy, distribute and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profit from someone's else intellectual product without restriction.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, that's exactly what I said.  It sounds strange to some people
<BR>
when you put it clearly, because we have had the idea that this is a
<BR>
bad thing so pounded into our heads over the years that it seems
<BR>
somehow &quot;natural&quot;.  The fact is, copyright is a recent idea, and not
<BR>
at all a natural one.  Yes, it /seems/ to many in our culture like
<BR>
theft to use someone else's idea, but it doesn't seem that way at all
<BR>
in many cultures (including ours in the past), and our justifications
<BR>
for making this cultural change were thin at best.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If pigs had wings, would pork be kosher?  If pi were 3, would circles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be hexagons?  I don't discuss the issue because it's a silly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; counterfactual that has no relevance to anything, but if you really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insist, then yes, if matter had the property of being able to serve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the wills of any number people at one time, then &quot;ownership&quot; wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be a necessary concept for matter either.  That's much the way it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for commodities like air on Earth.  So what?  That doesn't change the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; substance of any argument presented here on either side, and I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; see why you think it does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ah, good, this *is* the statement I wanted you to make.  And it does change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the substance of the argument Lee-- drastically.  Your lone statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;...then yes, if matter had the property of being able to serve the wills of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any number people [sic] at one time, then &quot;ownership&quot; wouldn't be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary concept for matter either.&quot; is a crucial concept.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And here's why:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is a forseeable and anticipated scenario-- particularly among list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; members.  Also, it's already happening-- our concept of physical goods is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shrinking daily-- we are truly entering an information economy.  If and when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it becomes possible to replicate, transmit and copy automobiles and computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processors as easily as we might digitally transmit music, your statement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessitates the elimination of our ownership over those commodities as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, sort of.  You still own the atoms, and you can still own the areas
<BR>
of space that they occupy.  In a full nanotech world where you can create
<BR>
the entire living environment you exist in out of seawater in minutes,
<BR>
the value of owning specific things is pretty scant absent sentimental
<BR>
attachments, but I don't see a problem with that.  We can still lock our
<BR>
doors to strangers, and still buy physical space next to other people
<BR>
with whom we want to associate, and we'll no doubt have some method to
<BR>
efficiently allocate seawater.  Even physical location might be less
<BR>
valuable with simple telepresence.  There might come a time when all
<BR>
these physical things are so plentiful that the only thing of any value
<BR>
will indeed be new ideas--new designs, and comsumer attention.  I find
<BR>
it very hard to believe that talented creators won't be wealthy beyond
<BR>
the dreams of anyone today in such a world.  I certainly hope you aren't
<BR>
going to argue that.  Is it not enough for you that they will be
<BR>
billionaires in such a world?  You want them to be trillionaire
<BR>
monopolists of the human mind as well?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hey, they might be desirable ones... for lots of people.  We could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anticipate humanity sliding into a state of utopia, will infinte product and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no rules of ownership-- just places and things and ideas, owned equally by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all.  One big lovely commune.  Could be very nice.  A little sleepy village
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in an idyllic valley filled with love and peace.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For me, the scenario is nightmarish.  It represents a negative attractor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state-- a static equilibrium with lots of shared resources-- one big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monoculture of ownership.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh.  That scares me too.  But as I've also pointed out before on this
<BR>
list, such a Utopia is not possible, because when everyone on the planet
<BR>
is a billionaire, the guy with two billion still gets the girl, the
<BR>
asteroid in a better neighborhood, and more connections and opportunities
<BR>
than the masses.  And there will always, therefore, be a drive to improve
<BR>
and create and trade, and there will always be a market, because even
<BR>
if physical things become less of a market, personal services will take
<BR>
up the role at the top.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If and when it becomes possible to create more effective positive feedback
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loops for successful algorithims than what we have, I'll be the first one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jump on the bandwagon.  I won't deny that the &quot;attention economy&quot; is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be increasingly important in the future.  If I can make amazing movies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for free and by simple use of my imagination, it *will* be enough of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reward to just get the acclaim for having done it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But in the meantime, megascale projects require megascale dollars and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; megascale ambition.  Until money goes away, we should be using it to drive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the process forward.  Direct reward for direct effort.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do you think &quot;megascale projects&quot; are a good thing to encourage,
<BR>
as opposed to small scale, personal, incremental acheivement?
