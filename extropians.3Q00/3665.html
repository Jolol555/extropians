<P>
I notice that you seem to have somehow forgotten &quot;auditing,&quot; or are they no 
<BR>
longer doing that?
<BR>
<P>I've known a couple of former auditors, who described the procedure briefly. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, you hold on to two tin cans, which are the inputs to the 
<BR>
&quot;E-Meter,&quot; which is a glorified skin resistance meter, as in the little 
<BR>
lie-detector kits you could buy from Radio Shack.  The auditor asks you a 
<BR>
set of standardized questions and watches the E-Meter responses for 
<BR>
indications of tension related to a topic.  Tension indicates an internal 
<BR>
state of conflict.  Once the exact nature and source of the tension has been 
<BR>
isolated and identified, the person is asked to make a choice to do 
<BR>
something about the problem.  Only when the person has genuinely committed 
<BR>
to positively resolving the underlying problem - as indicated by the 
<BR>
reduction of tension - are they allowed to continue.
<BR>
<P>Thru many, many expensive auditings, a person is lead systematically to 
<BR>
resolve all the internal contradictions and conflicts in their lives, until 
<BR>
they are &quot;clear.&quot;  At this point, nothing budges the needle on the E-Meter.
<BR>
<P>While this methodology sounds very good, and seems to work reasonably well 
<BR>
in practice, at least initially, in straitening out conflicted persons' 
<BR>
lives, the drawbacks and problems are severalfold.  Here are a few of the 
<BR>
obvious problems:
<BR>
<P>First, it is very well established that the galvanic skin response is 
<BR>
extremely easy to condition.  Thus, a person can learn to control the meter 
<BR>
without even realizing they are, just by the conditioning of the process 
<BR>
itself.  Thus, going clear may simply indicate a person has learned to 
<BR>
control his GSR, not that anything has been solved.
<BR>
<P>Second, pathological lyers, sociopaths, psychotics, CIA and KGB agents, 
<BR>
among other nice people, are notorious for being able to ace much more 
<BR>
sophisticated polygraph tests, from training or pathology (or both).  These 
<BR>
people may well quickly move to &quot;clear&quot; and become star members of any 
<BR>
organization that relies upon anything like an E-Meter - which could explain 
<BR>
some of the internal problems and purges I've heard rumors of from the 
<BR>
scientologists I currently know.
<BR>
<P>Third, the guidance by the auditor itself may lead or coerce the person into 
<BR>
decisions and acceptances that are contrary to reason or their real 
<BR>
interests, and may be a major part of a process of real hypnosis.  See 
<BR>
&quot;Explorations in Hypnosis,&quot; for a good explanation for how the process of 
<BR>
hypnosis actually works - and it does.  It always requires the person to 
<BR>
first accept some minor breach with reality, which has the effect of 
<BR>
disconnecting the critical faculties.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a philosophically naive person, thru his or her willingness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; such nonsense as part of the &quot;training,&quot; could easilly lose all grip 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; reality as we know it, at least on a cognitive level.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know much about Scientology other than what I've seen on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; internet. but I've known a person who practiced it and lived for a while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their Florida community.  This person was one of the most disturbing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individuals I've ever talked to.  Whenever he spoke of a topic related 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Scientology (and as their training is broad, many things in daily life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be related to Scientology) he would begin to speak in a monotone, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; though he were reciting words that had been fed into his mind under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hypnosis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is no hypnosis practiced in Scientology.  People learn by the unique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;method of reading books and being tested on what they've read.  The most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;esoteric thing they do is have people model key concepts in clay as part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the test.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is frightening, folks.  You all seem fairly objective and level headed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on most subjects... but on this one, I'd have to give the whole list an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;F&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Scientology is silly.  It's eastern religion altered by a science fiction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;writer to take on the trappings of a &quot;scientific&quot; belief system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However... they don't hypnotize people, they don't tear families apart and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they don't eat babies.  They ARE over litigious and a bit paranoid... but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they have ample reason to be that way.  They have real enemies that use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nasty tactics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The cult of christianity in all it's forms, from catholics to mormons, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much much worse.  You are wasting time and energy on the wrong target.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Loree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;P.S.  I've never met any scientologist who behaved like you describe,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Barbara.  I have met massive numbers of christians who fit that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;description,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;however.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'll bet we all have.
