<EM>&gt; &gt; Regarding making &quot;good&quot; games.  It is an interersting question as

<EM>&gt; &gt; to what seduces people into games -- currently the paradigm would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; seem to suggest good graphics is a necessity -- in contrast the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1970's games had *no* graphics -- you had to map the game entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in your head.  I wonder if there are two types of people -- those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who can create mental images reflecting a reality and those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; require the images to be painted for them who would be enrolled

<EM>&gt; Yeah- readers vs mouth breathers.

<P>Quite. And no Doug, you are not being cynical.

<P>As a kid, I loved military aircraft, ships, and battles. Problem was, mom
<BR>
refused to buy me any of those COOL GI Joe toys or other military models, so
<BR>
being the only kid on the block who was reading whole books at age 4, I would
<BR>
take bits of wood (we were not poor) and plastic, and make symbolic weapons,
<BR>
vehicles, ships and soldiers, and stage my little battles in the dirtpile behind
<BR>
the shed. Is it any wonder they other kids laughed at my little piles of sticks
<BR>
when they asked what I was doing and I said I was running a war???
