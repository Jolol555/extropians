<EM>&gt; &gt; You know, there is a wealth of literature  - the Bible, the tale of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Gilgamesh, the Shah Nama, etc., which describes individuals living for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; centuries,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can imagine a mechanism whereby such accounts would have gotten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorded: as the stories and legends were passed down verbally thru the ages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each generation perceived the fathers and grandfathers as much older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the teller perceived himself, even when the teller reached the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; age the ancestor was at his passing.  For that reason, since the teller
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knows his own age but is unsure of the age of the ancestor, he would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply add ten or twenty years, or perhaps fifty.  The process is repeated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until the advent of writing, and you end up with 900+ year lifespans.
</EM><BR>
<P>With regard to the Bible, it was suggested to me by a Russian scientist
<BR>
at one point, that the biblical longevities could be due to a translation
<BR>
error.  If ages were kept in &quot;months&quot; rather than &quot;years&quot;, then the
<BR>
numbers work out about right.  Given that it was the mideast and seasonal
<BR>
variations might be much less and in ancient agricultural communities
<BR>
it might be more natural to count changes of the moon rather than
<BR>
changes of the seasons, I could see this as being a plausible explanation.
