It appears as if Dana Hedberg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dah@signalinteractive.com?Subject=Re:%20spiritual%20hyperspace&In-Reply-To=&lt;200007191437.QAA17684@color.sics.se&gt;">dah@signalinteractive.com</A>&gt; wrote:

<BR>
<P>I have made some empirical studies of how cats interact which each other
<BR>
and with humans.
<BR>
<P>I have noticed that people allergic to cats normally try to avoid the cat,
<BR>
by avoiding to even look at it, so it won't approach them.
<BR>
<P>They are in error.
<BR>
<P>In the cat body language, this means they behave non-aggressively, and most
<BR>
cats will approach them shortly, in a simular manner, to show they appreciate
<BR>
the gesture.
<BR>
<P>If people stare intently on the cat, in the cat body language, this means
<BR>
they behave aggressively, and most cats will try to avoid them, esp. if the
<BR>
people make fast head movements to stare at the cat whenever it moves into
<BR>
the neighbourhood of the human.  After a while the cat feel threated and
<BR>
will retire from the area.
<BR>
<P>If that does not work, looking at the cat, baring the teeth, and make a low
<BR>
hissing noise will make the cat definitely avoid the human.
<BR>
<P>A small kitten lived with me for some time, and when it followed me out for
<BR>
the first, a neighbourhood cat came to inspect it.  I showed the warning
<BR>
behaviour above, as any cat mother would have, and the neighbourhood cat
<BR>
still avoids me even though the incident happened many years ago.
