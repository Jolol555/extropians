Whew, there's a lot of ideas flying around on this
<BR>
topic.  I'll confess up front to being a psychologist,
<BR>
though I rarely do therapy. But I would like to add a
<BR>
few comments here.

<P>&quot;Psychotherapy is bunk.
<BR>
<P>Experiment demonstrates that psychotherapy produces

results slightly worse than a control group in which
<BR>
patients just talk to a random person for an hour.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And how does that make you feel? ;-D
<BR>
<P>Seriously though, I'd also like to see your source.

<P>&quot;I believe it was Timothy Leary (pre-LSD) that did the
<BR>
original study and found that of people that received
<BR>
psychotherapy roughly a third got better, a third
<BR>
stayed the same, and a third got worse - exactly the
<BR>
same as a control group which did not receive any
<BR>
therapy&quot;
<BR>
<P>That's a really old study. There's been tons of
<BR>
research since then. My notes are buried in the closet
<BR>
somewhere but, as you might imagine, this is not the
<BR>
first time that therapists have been accused of being
<BR>
ineffective.  Consequently there have been many
<BR>
outcome studies conducted to address this very point.
<BR>
A few years ago, Bergin (I believe) conducted a
<BR>
meta-analysis study which reviewed and integrated a
<BR>
large number of those studies.  The exact numbers
<BR>
escape me but the results indicated that therapy is
<BR>
more effective than no therapy on the average, but not
<BR>
by much.  It also demonstrated that the theoretical
<BR>
orientation used (cognitive therapy, Gestalt,
<BR>
Psychopdynamic, etc) made no difference.  (BTW, Freud
<BR>
is NOT a cognitive psychologist).  There's a ton of
<BR>
research that cognitive therapy is well-suited to
<BR>
depression.  So are meds.  And the two together are
<BR>
better than either alone. 
<BR>
<P>There's a good article on effectiveness by a quite
<BR>
famous psychologist (Martin Seligman) at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/seligm.htm">http://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/seligm.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Can anyone do therapy?  Well, it has been shown that
<BR>
Ph.D.s are no more effective than Master's level
<BR>
counselors. Are trained counselor's better than your
<BR>
Aunt Jane? Probably, although there are a lot of
<BR>
natural-born counselors out there. Empathy and
<BR>
reflective listening skills don't come easy to a lot
<BR>
of people, though.  Plus, maybe you don't don't want
<BR>
to talk to Aunt Jane (or your preacher) about your
<BR>
sexual hang-ups.
<BR>
<P>When I did do therapy for a community mental health
<BR>
center, I noticed that many client's problems were
<BR>
already resolved to a considerable degree by the time
<BR>
they showed up for the appointment.  This was because
<BR>
just knowing that they had an appointment got them on
<BR>
a therapeutic track. Sorta like cleaning the house
<BR>
before the maid shows up. It always boiled down to
<BR>
whether the client was motivated to take action and
<BR>
improve or take no action and blame someone/something
<BR>
else.
<BR>
<P>I do have a problem with Pop Psychologists and the
<BR>
marketing of self-esteem/self-love.  The only thing I
<BR>
ever heard Dr. Luara say that I liked was when her
<BR>
caller complained of having low self-esteem and Laura
<BR>
replied with, &quot;Well, have you done anything lately to
<BR>
deserve feelings of self-esteem?&quot; TRhe caller was
<BR>
stumped. I personally think it's more important to
<BR>
foster and facilitate a genuine sense of
<BR>
self-efficacy. The rest will follow.
<BR>
<P>I recently watched Mumford, a movie about a guy who
<BR>
pretends to be a psychologist and everyone loves this
<BR>
guy.  They think he's a great therapist.  When the
<BR>
other therapist in town asks him what his theoretical
<BR>
approach is, he says he doesn 't really have one
<BR>
because people's problems are too complex and
<BR>
ingrained by the time they come to him.  All he said
<BR>
he did was listen and encourage them to talk about the
<BR>
problem and he found that they often found at least a
<BR>
partial solution.
<BR>
<P>Nigel talked about how sophisticated strategies
<BR>
developed by advertisers might be useful.  I recall a
<BR>
book titled the Psychology of Persuasion. Might want
<BR>
to check it out.

<BR>
<P>He mentioned how people are good at small decisions
<BR>
and not so good at big decisions.  That's a
<BR>
no-brainer, isn't it.  The big decisions are perceived
<BR>
as a lot more relevant and so the decision making is
<BR>
often mucked up by stressful emotions. My dissertation
<BR>
was on decision-making, specifically Career Indecision
<BR>
and the degree to which various affective states
<BR>
interfered with effective decision making processes.
<BR>
My theoretical grounding came from Personal Construct
<BR>
Psychology.
