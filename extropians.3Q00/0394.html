<P>&lt;&lt; hat is not the same thing. Yes, you can move around the matter in the
<BR>
&nbsp;universe quite a bit using small impulses and a lot of time and
<BR>
&nbsp;cleverness. But the theorem actually says you cannot close an open
<BR>
&nbsp;universe no matter what, it has to do with the spacetime topology and
<BR>
&nbsp;cannot be changed by merely (say) piling all the matter into a big
<BR>
&nbsp;ball or something similar. To make matters worse, we have a
<BR>
&nbsp;cosmological constant to deal with too. Of course, quantum gravity and
<BR>
&nbsp;such things may complicate things enough to enable closure, but that
<BR>
&nbsp;remains in the realm of wishing for the moment. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Oh yes, I never said that Tipler's Cosmology, which is merely a compilation 
<BR>
of the work by J.A. Wheeler at U of Texas as well as the late Charles 
<BR>
Meissner from MIT, was a complete theory, merely a very strong hypothesis. I 
<BR>
wonder why, we give all of eternity over to these universal constants and 
<BR>
then say it shall be so forever? Like Ray Kurzweil, I hold that intelligence 
<BR>
(meat or silicon) is a decent way for the universe or ensamble of universes 
<BR>
to change things. To quote Kurzweil:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot; Ultimately intelligence will be a force to be reckon with,  even for these 
<BR>
big celestial forces (so watch out!)  The laws of physics Are NOT repealed in 
<BR>
their presence, but they effectively evaporate in its presence. &quot;
<BR>
<P>&lt;Well, a neuron star is a nice thing when you want to resurrect your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;relatives all the way back to pre-dynastic Egypt and other small
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;projects :-) But it doesn't give you the real, infinite
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculations/memory storage, Omega Point. Accept no substitutes :-)  &gt;
<BR>
<P>Anders please!  We mammals and  other carbon/water forms are indeed being 
<BR>
forced to accept the subsititute called mortality. Along the way many people 
<BR>
may achieve the ecshaton through cryo- or  NeoBio, or uploading to Stellar 
<BR>
Mindplaces or the Linde Scenario; but right now its the big sleep, for all of 
<BR>
us, unless evidenced otherwise. Keep working lads and lasses!!
<BR>
<P>&lt;That plasma can be chaotic does not prove that it can be used to
<BR>
perform useful calculations. I'm not aware of any proofs that plasma
<BR>
chaos is of the right kind to be Turing-complete, but I can imagine it
<BR>
is. However, a real physical (nuclear) plasma is a different thing,
<BR>
and may very well have diffusion or randomness effects that disrupts
<BR>
the computations. &gt;
<BR>
<P>I am guessing you are correct, but then who the heck really thinks about even 
<BR>
considering using plasma as a subsitiute for  computation except a minority 
<BR>
of people pn this list?  Maybe we need some insight from plasma physicists? 
<BR>
Oh, if Hannes Alfvens were only here!  Actually, I was looking at the chaos 
<BR>
(poops in the plasma) as a potential off-on function. 
<BR>
<P>To sum it up, I aggree with the notion that Tipler doesn't have everything, 
<BR>
just a decent round about notion. Will other concepts like an accelerated 
<BR>
expansion wipe out Tipler's thesis? No, because the expansion is, from what I 
<BR>
understand, going at speeds very much under lighspeed. Given even 10 billion 
<BR>
years to over-take the expansion and I believe we've (whomever we've become 
<BR>
or merged with) will  modify the cosmological environment.  Example, nothing 
<BR>
can go faster then light-except patterns inside an table-top sized electrical 
<BR>
device built either by Anton Zeilinger in Austria or Raymond Chiao in 
<BR>
Toronto. Give it a few Giga or Peta years.... ;-)
