From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20SV:%20Makign%20money%20as%20a%20creative%20(was)%20Napster:%20thoughts%20and&In-Reply-To=&lt;01a301bfedb3$c9fd1ac0$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Thats not what he's saying. The viewers pay nothing to receive the tv
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmissions, and are also free to record any tv shows on their vcr,
</EM><BR>
without
<BR>
<EM>&gt; license. Its advertisers who pay the cost of production and transmission,
</EM><BR>
just
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as can be done on CDs, with ads between each song (as has already been
</EM><BR>
done
<BR>
<EM>&gt; before, see Seig Seig Sputnik, dating back to 1987).
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Read again.  He says:
<BR>
<P>a) &quot;The naked, unsupported assertion that music sales will not support
<BR>
artists absent copyright won't become true no matter how many times you
<BR>
repeat it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>To summarize, he believes: The statement &quot;music sales will not support
<BR>
artists absent copyright&quot; is false.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Crocker goes on to say:
<BR>
<P>b) &quot;If this [the above statement] were *true* [emphasis mine] broadcast
<BR>
television and radio would not exist at all, and yet they are billion dollar
<BR>
industries.
<BR>
<P>To summarize, he believes: If the statement &quot;music sales will not support
<BR>
artists absent copyright&quot; were true, then TV and radio would not exist
<BR>
today.
<BR>
<P>Thus, we are to gather that he believes that TV and radio are capable of
<BR>
supporting their makers without the need for copyright.
<BR>
<P>Which is pure garbage-- it doesn't matter that they make their money from
<BR>
advertisers-- advertisers only pay people with audiences.  If you don't own
<BR>
your content, then I can broadcast it too and I can get all the advertising
<BR>
revenue.  Again, there would be no good reason to spend money 'making'
<BR>
content-- I should just concentrate on being the best broadcaster possible.
<BR>
<P><PRE>
--
<P>In addition, a viewer's 'right' to record the transmissions is a lot more
limited and dicey than you might believe.  Believe it or not, broadcasters
do guard the right of recording and re-transmittal.
