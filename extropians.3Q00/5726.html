Franklin Wayne Poley writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't understand much about the process behind my calculator but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand the product.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, of course. Note that the question is not why your calculator would want to
<BR>
be friendly. We're discussing why AI (of the human-competitive kind) would want
<BR>
to be friendly. Lay persons make themselves obsolete to the degree that they
<BR>
fail to understand the significance of the Artilects, Mind Children, Robo
<BR>
sapiens, and Spiritual Machines that do considerably more to enhance production
<BR>
than the most sophisticated calculators (or present day super computers for that
<BR>
matter).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think it depends on how you approach the public. Nobody is threatened by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the $5 calculator. Everyone thinks it is a useful invention. However, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surpasses &quot;human equivalency&quot; with respect to arithmetic ability (which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometimes in measuring IQ). I don't think the general public is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatened by chess playing machines which surpass human equivalency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although some human experts are. If you explain that &quot;transhuman&quot; AI as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is called on the Singularity web site in such terms I expect most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people will see it as a positive contribution to socially beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventions. Actually I think it is &quot;intellectual workers&quot; who will be most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threatened. The general public would want to know how you propose to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it under control if it has mobility and autonomy and genetic algorithms.
</EM><BR>
<P>I find your comments reasonable and plausible. Hostile reactions to AI (as
<BR>
imagined by some contributors here) may be exaggerated. It could be that most
<BR>
folks will welcome AI as yet another labor-saving appliance -- which saves them
<BR>
the trouble of thinking for themselves. It's been my experience that lots of
<BR>
people dread exercising their brains even more than we dread exercising our
<BR>
muscles.
