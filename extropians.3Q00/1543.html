<P>That sounds like a great idea - I'd love to see what you have in mind.
<BR>
Perhaps the first thing to do is get setup at sourceforge: That'll give
<BR>
you a place to start posting some ideas, and set up a couple of discussion
<BR>
lists to get some brainstorming going. If you're doing something exciting,
<BR>
I'd be interested in getting involved.
<BR>
<P>I've been interested, on and off, in some sort of distributed mud-like
<BR>
system. I'd like, for instance, to be able to walk through a door and
<BR>
seamlessly be talking to another server. Or manipulate objects whose
<BR>
behavior is being computed on another machine somewhere else. You'd figure
<BR>
out some system where by objects (a stove, a book, etc.) declare the ways
<BR>
in which they can be manipulated (open, close, read, etc.), along with
<BR>
verb mappings, then anyone can drop new objects in, run it's innards
<BR>
anywhere, and let people play with it. Some sort of Corba'ish/RMI deal. 
<BR>

<P><P>Ryan v24.2:
<BR>
<P>The 'server user exchange' is currently being done.  Origin's virtual world
<BR>
is actually a composite of several servers, each one running a defined
<BR>
virtual space.  They set this up with load balancing in mind - in Ultima
<BR>
Online, there are areas in which more users are active at any given time -
<BR>
such as urban areas in the game. After post-beta test analysis, i imagine
<BR>
they divided their world up such that a given server, say, one that includes
<BR>
a user-frequented virtual city, covers less space than another server
<BR>
running the wilderness outside the city walls.  With this idea in mind, they
<BR>
connect many servers (connected in-game at 'server lines'- points at which a
<BR>
crossing player's and associated objects' states are copied into memory and
<BR>
then transferred to the server running the adjacent virtual landscape.  The
<BR>
character jumps to another server seamlessly - players generally don't
<BR>
notice this in the game (it doesnt freeze and load the new server geography,
<BR>
anyway).  I tooled around with this and actually charted some server lines -
<BR>
i was able to make the distinction because in some parts of the 'world' i
<BR>
could 'move faster' (less player load on the server i was crossing into)
<BR>
than others. I imagine if the hardware rescources were sufficient, this
<BR>
could (and should) be incorporated into the game to avoid the speed
<BR>
differential.
<BR>
<P>To prevent hackers from creating their own virtual super-weapons or making
<BR>
super-characters (which really unbalances the game and makes it unfun for
<BR>
most players), EVERYTHING - characters, objects, etc. actually exists on
<BR>
Origin's servers.  What you buy when you purchase the game is an account,
<BR>
the interface with Origin's servers, and all the graphics.  The states of
<BR>
all of the objects associated with your account are maintained  by them.
<BR>
<P>I agree that players should have the ability to design new graphics and
<BR>
objects, or even new places - but for this to occur in an environment such
<BR>
as the one above, one would need a dedicated user design system, built on a
<BR>
foundation of the publication of in-game object properties and a strong set
<BR>
of rules, whereby players could submit their inventions for review by a
<BR>
'game upgrade team'.  If an object is accepted, it must be uploaded into all
<BR>
of the servers (so player X with object Y doesn't mysteriously lose object Y
<BR>
when he crosses into another server) and would probably be uploaded to
<BR>
players' machines in the form of auto-patches on connection with the game
<BR>
servers, as part of an 'update schedule'.
<BR>
<P>All of this assumes that you want the 'original game world' to be uniform
<BR>
for your global user base.  No doubt if the game is open source, the players
<BR>
are going to create their own little virtual worlds. I really like this idea
<BR>
too, but if this is where you (now were getting to 'we', because this is
<BR>
what Wil and I have been talking about:) want to take it, what you'd really
<BR>
want to be designing is not necessarily a game, but a object-oriented game
<BR>
design program and the engines to run it.  Like an 'Adventure Construction
<BR>
Set' (first implemented by Electronic Arts back in my Commodore 64 days -
<BR>
loved that game.)
