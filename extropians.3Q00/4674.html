<EM>&gt; &gt;....If I seek transcendance through intelligence enhancement, uploading,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;or something &gt;else, can't I expect to lose this illusion I call my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;identity?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this thing you call identity is not exactly an illusion, it's just
<BR>
not what you thought it was. i thought this discussion was about how to
<BR>
_get_ what we want ... but now i suspect it is more about how to _know_
<BR>
what we want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I was asking why AI/SI would/could 'want to want' anything... Why and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how should it gain Consciousness? Is being conscious a prerequisite of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanting? That's THE question!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be conscious is to live a narrative ... a story. the essence of
<BR>
a story is conflict. two options: be conscious and conflicted or be
<BR>
unconscious ... is there a third choice?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Uploading my memory bank into a machine: What would be the difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between leaning/reading/ thinking everything in one second or in one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousand years? Zip! Uploading would essentially mean the end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illusion of time. Life without that illusion equals absolute eteranl
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insanity. Also, I'd really miss my body. Identity itself may be a dynamic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illusion and therefore, time dependent - not to mention reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether time is an illusion is a question of physics. insanity is
<BR>
a characterization we make about others. we change, full stop.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; What enhancements are available to me now? To be here and not exist at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same time, to be conscious and not want anything, sort of a Zen state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; observation, appeals to me but I keep getting in the way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*out of drunk mode* i always wondered about this ... how does one
<BR>
decide to _become_ a zen master? if actions are always the results of
<BR>
goals, and the uninitiated pursues &quot;worldly&quot; goals, how does anyone _ever_
<BR>
become a zen master, with &quot;un-worldly&quot; goals? isn't there a gap in there
<BR>
somewhere? say i'm an average merchant ... why would i, with my worldly
<BR>
set of goals ... want to become a zen master? do i see a zen master and
<BR>
say to myself, gee, if i had that kind of self-control, i would be able to
<BR>
make a whole lot more money?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Cryogenics? I do question the finality of death. Not sure I believe in it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, if you can get me a brand new body........
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>-x
<BR>
<P>&quot;had we but world enough and time, 
<BR>
&nbsp;this coyness, lady, were no crime ...&quot;
