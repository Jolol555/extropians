<EM>&gt; I can just imagine the FBI getting their orders mixed up, and putting a

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resign now!

<P>This is in regards to &quot;major ISP&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I recently signed on to one of these major ISP's, a major label cable modem
<BR>
access service, let's euthanize it as being &quot;Desert Bird&quot;, or rather,
<BR>
&quot;Running Bord&quot;, thus that the anonymized acronym is RB.
<BR>
<P>I start using this cable modem, and it works fine for the first week.
<BR>
Then, something goes wrong in their system and for almost the past week it
<BR>
exhibits 5-20 packet drops on ping.
<BR>
<P>This has caused me to reexamine this system, my regular old POTS modem,
<BR>
etcetera.  I got some new drivers for my modem and changed one of the
<BR>
access strings to better with my old POTS modem which I still keep, thus
<BR>
that I can start to play StarCraft online, which for a game being more than
<BR>
two years old has quite online active play.
<BR>
<P>So, I had had a problem which I was ignoring which had to do with e-mail
<BR>
and RB.  Basically, I use this Netscape e-mail client for better or worse,
<BR>
although recent events leave to me to consider writing my own.  Anyways,
<BR>
the RB POP service is configured to deny Netscape e-mail POP, and the
<BR>
service representative of RB told me that only MS Outlook e-mail client was
<BR>
&quot;supported&quot;.  What that means euphemistically is that the Netscape e-mail
<BR>
send function is configuredly not accepted by the Windows Exchange e-mail
<BR>
server.  Basically, I am quite sure that the Netscape POP e-mail client is
<BR>
a standard one.  When I addressed the fact that I had been able to send
<BR>
e-mail, sporadically, through the RB account using Netscape e-mail client,
<BR>
and not after some configuration change, the tech said that only Outlook
<BR>
was &quot;supported&quot; and that Netscape wasn't compatible with the &quot;LAN&quot;.
<BR>
<P>So, I think we've established that no U.S. citizen here needs a subpoena to
<BR>
read any government e-mail, basically.  The question is now:  when using a
<BR>
commodity ISP, should one expect and be afforded standard access to
<BR>
standard commodity services using standard software?
<BR>
<P>In this context, I don't have any particular problem using the Outlook
<BR>
client software except that I prefer not to use a client that allows buffer
<BR>
overflows form any received e-mail as of last week.  I'm sure the
<BR>
alternative commodity web groupware software (Netscape) has it's own issues
<BR>
with regards to security, yet by habit I use it.
<BR>
<P>Here's the second question:  if you are sold or given software that has a
<BR>
deliberate security flaw (security defined as the applet sandbox) of which
<BR>
you are not made aware nor fix made available, have you been damaged?
<BR>
<P>If so, so has everybody else that used that software.
<BR>
<P>In regards to Carnivore: iff (that means if and only if) one e-mail account
<BR>
is identified through other means as being used for illegal purposes and
<BR>
iff that account has a judged warrant issued to monitor it, then the
<BR>
warrantor(?) may keep a copy of that e-mail account's incoming e-mail,
<BR>
commonly called its spool.
