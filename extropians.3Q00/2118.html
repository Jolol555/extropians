<P><EM>    &gt; &lt;&lt; Organic lasers.  Neato.  And Completo. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; I looked at the short article. I am not so sure the writer conveyed how these
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; benzene beauties will enhance technological prowess? Is there any
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; intermediate term benefit that you see coming from this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, plastic Lasers could be far cheaper than anything we have today, you could
<BR>
make thousands of them on a small flexible plastic sheet. They could also be much
<BR>
more energy efficient than the semiconductor Lasers we have today. And by fiddling
<BR>
with the chemistry a little it should be possible to make them work from the infrared to
<BR>
the ultraviolet, the very first experiment produced not a infrared or even a red but a
<BR>
green Laser, that's pretty high frequency for this early in the learning curve.
<BR>
<P>Incidentally this is a good issue of Science, the Laser article wasn't the only
<BR>
interesting thing, the phrase &quot;bearings in mechanical nanodevices&quot; really
<BR>
caught my eye:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Graphite sheets slide past each other with relatively little friction, and it has been
<BR>
predicted that multiwall carbon nanotubes could also readily slide past each other.
<BR>
Cumings and Zettl (p. 602; see the Perspective by Forró) have taken advantage
<BR>
of a recently developed &quot;arcing&quot; method to free inner carbon nanotubes from the
<BR>
outermost tubes at the end caps and now explore the motion of undamaged nested
<BR>
nanotubes. They attached a nanomanipulator to the inner bundle and show that it
<BR>
slides out freely. When a pulled-out inner tube is detached from the manipulator,
<BR>
van der Waals forces rapidly retract it back into the bundle. Such low-friction sliding
<BR>
motion could possibly be used as &quot;bearings&quot; in mechanical nanodevices.&quot;
