<P>
Dear Extropes,
<BR>
<P><P>We have an opening, available now, for a PhD position in our Cosmic
<BR>
Dust group at the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Kernphysik in Heidelberg,
<BR>
Germany.
<BR>
<P><P>The group:
<BR>
<P>Our Dust group is devoted to the study of interplanetary and
<BR>
intergalactic dust in the solar system. In particular, the head of
<BR>
the group, Eberhard Gruen, builds and flies dust detectors on
<BR>
spacecraft. Almost every spacecraft flying with a dust detector was
<BR>
built by him- currently his Cassini, Galileo, Ulysses, and Gorid
<BR>
dust detectors are all returning good dust data.
<BR>
<P>Gruen is well-respected in the planetary science community -- so much
<BR>
so, that he has an almost god-like status, and he is an exceedingly
<BR>
nice man too. Our group is small - less than 10, and we all work well
<BR>
together.
<BR>
<P>In addition, our group has the infrastructure at MPI-K to support a
<BR>
dust accelerator (one of only two in the world), which is necessary
<BR>
to test theories for how dust charges and impacts bodies in space.
<BR>
<P>In July 2001, our group will be hosting the annual
<BR>
Galileo-Ulysses-Cassini-Stardust Dust workshop in Heidelberg, so
<BR>
that will be a great opportunity to meet the other researchers in
<BR>
the field (typical attendance is about 70).
<BR>
<P>Your work: 
<BR>
<P>Is about the charging and dynamics of dust particles in planetary
<BR>
magnetospheres. However, if you like lab work, you can probably
<BR>
switch to a thesis topic involving the interpretation of mass
<BR>
spectra from impact ionization detectors, to help in the
<BR>
interpretation of Cassini dust data.
<BR>
<P>The charging and dynamics of dust in planetary magnetospheres is my
<BR>
research area, so you will possibly go into research avenues that I've
<BR>
not been able to get to in my thesis, and I will be around long enough
<BR>
to help you get started.
<BR>
<P>The living environment:
<BR>
<P>Heidelberg is one of the most beautiful cities in Germany- it is a
<BR>
popular tourist attraction for both Germans and non-Germans, alike.
<BR>
It is a college town, built around an old university and a very
<BR>
large old castle. It is one of the few places in Germany that was
<BR>
not bombed during WWII. It is surrounded by the thick Odenwald
<BR>
forest and it has mild temperatures. The Rhein valley is the warmest
<BR>
part of Germany.
<BR>
<P>Housing is expensive- it is the second most expensive city to live
<BR>
after Muenchen. However, most of the other living expenses (food
<BR>
etc.) are about half of what I was paying in California. So, even
<BR>
though German PhD students don't earn very much, they can live
<BR>
comfortably.
<BR>
<P>Heidelberg is located well for travel to other parts of Europe and
<BR>
easy to travel by train, or by long-distance bus. Frankfurt, the
<BR>
busiest airport in Europe is one hour's drive away.
<BR>
<P>To qualify:
<BR>
<P>You should have achieved the equivalent of a Physics German &quot;diplom&quot;
<BR>
status which equals an American Master's degree. The time for PhD
<BR>
thesis is 2 years + a one year extension (typical).
<BR>
<P>Your nationality is not important, but you should have some
<BR>
knowledge of the German language. Working language is either English
<BR>
or German.
<BR>
<P>You can contact me about this position:  <A HREF="mailto:Amara.Graps@mpi-hd.mpg.de?Subject=Re:%20PhD%20position%20open%20in%20Cosmic%20dust%20group&In-Reply-To=&lt;200007202328.BAA23148@galileo.mpi-hd.mpg.de&gt;">Amara.Graps@mpi-hd.mpg.de</A>
<BR>
and I will pass the word on.
