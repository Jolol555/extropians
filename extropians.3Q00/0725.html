<EM>&gt; &gt; 1) As you may have heard Microsoft is trying very much to regain control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by putting all of their software back into their central servers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you cite a reference for this?  (It sounds a bit far-fetched.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Easy.  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">http://www.microsoft.com/net/</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps you mean that they intend to move to an active license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monitoring system for their software -- i.e. their software comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from their servers when you need it.  This is &quot;software on demand&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or &quot;software rental&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, they're assuming that by the time their .net initiative becomes reality the
<BR>
majority of people will have high-speed access to the net.  The presumption is
<BR>
that you will be logging onto their servers and using the programs exactly as if
<BR>
you were logging onto a mainframe through a dumb terminal.  They say this will be
<BR>
a great advantage to the consumer, because they will be able to access their
<BR>
computation from any device, network PC, PDA, cell phone, etc.  In fact every
<BR>
major software company is pushing this paradigm - Oracle, Apple, Sun...  Remember,
<BR>
&quot;the network is the computer&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nobody in their right mind will buy this option.  Corporate presidents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will not store corporate data at Microsoft unless Microsoft accepts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liability for data loss, guarantees privacy, etc.  Even Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't have pockets deep enough for that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, but the majority of consumers probably will when there is no clear and
<BR>
easy alternative.  As for companies a compromise may be reached where they retain
<BR>
the data, while the software managing it will remain in Microsoft's hands.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, they could monitor you every time you start Excel or Powerpoint
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but that would require permanent connections for all PCs and we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a long way away from that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so.  Since you will be logging onto their servers, they could have logs of
<BR>
everything you do while online - leaving exactly the same kind of activity log you
<BR>
do when using a mainframe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How you extrapolate that to &quot;full power to control what you see or do&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't clear to me.  You can make your data arbitrarily secure by simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encrypting it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, but the overwhelming majority of people do not how to use encryption.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The old idea of liberating the people by offering them desktop computers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; flattening hierarchies, decentralizing power will have been undone.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will have returned to the old paradigm of large centralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; info-warehouses with the rest of us left with nothing more than dumb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; terminals circa 1970.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Huh?  If so its going to be a big disappointment to Intel or TransMeta.
</EM><BR>
<P>How so?  Both Intel and Trasmeta stand to make a large sums of cash when the
<BR>
number  of people accessing the internet from handheld wireless devices exceeds
<BR>
all landline access, as analysts are predicting will occur sometime next year.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If Microsoft makes their licensing of software more restrictive people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will simply move to other suppliers, esp. open source systems if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel so inclined.
</EM><BR>
<P>I  hope you're right. I know most open-source advocates feel this new .net
<BR>
initiative will do exactly just that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So here is the golden question - will the creator of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; first assembler, weather it be Zyvex or some other company hold ALL the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patent and intellectual property rights to all future assemblers based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on their design?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to patent law, for ~20 years yes.  The key words are &quot;their design&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah yes, but as recent patent grants have shown companies are obtaining rights far
<BR>
exceeding what the spirit of patent law has intended.  The recent Amazon.com
<BR>
patent scandal comes to mind.  Besides, its all in the wording right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There seems to be an assumption that there is only 1 path to an assembler.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That is highly doubtful.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope so.  My fear is that the inventors of the first assembler will patent the
<BR>
idea of the assembler itself, rather than their specific design.  Various
<BR>
microprocessors are as different from each other as night and day, yet one guy
<BR>
obtained the patent rights and subsequent royalty rights on all them.  Doesn't it
<BR>
seem possible then for the inventors of the assembler to do the same thing?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; High tech companies make businesses out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; figuring out ways around each others patents.  Its a complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business decision whether to try and work around a patent or to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay whatever licensing fees are being demanded.  If IBM wants to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay Zyvex $50 billion for the rights to use the assembler patents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I doubt Zyvex is going to say no...
</EM><BR>
<P>You're probably right, and hopefully this will happen in sufficient quantity to
<BR>
create a healthy and competitive nanotech industry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you want every Tom, Dick and Harry to be able to have the ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to assemble bubonic plague in their basement?
</EM><BR>
<P>They have that ability now.  Less than $10,000 gets you all the equipment
<BR>
necessary to create a plethora of nasty bio-weapons.  One only needs the
<BR>
knowledge.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is likely that a small set of companies will become leaders in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the economy from a manufacturing perspective.  They will make their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money by imposing a small surcharge on the cost of the raw materials
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and manufacturing.  (It may be a big surcharge until the competition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gets rolling...).  But the *real* money isn't in the manufacturing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is in the designs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Getting sufficient competition involved is my entire point.
