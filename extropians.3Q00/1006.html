<P><EM>&gt;Unfortunately, present copyrights are being thrown out the window very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quickly, and they took a long time to go into place.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They were made to protect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Otherwise anyone who had more resources can basically screw you selling 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea and claiming you never thought it up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now pretty much they don't work in this new found freedom, and we have to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;careful about demanding they BE enforced, because we lose the benign 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarchy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the net.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I like that idea that it can be let go of, so we can enjoy our freedom, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so things can be available.... but so far you have failed to prove any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;viable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alternative that works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's a complex question.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's may be a complex question, but it has a simple answer.  Information is 
<BR>
breaking loose from the chains that have held it back for millenia.  There's 
<BR>
no two ways about it.  Sure I suppose there will be a continuing arms race 
<BR>
for sometime between those who want to emancipate information and those who 
<BR>
want to keep it under lock and key.  But, since there are far more people 
<BR>
who benefit from free access to information than those who benefit from 
<BR>
restrictive access, my money will always be on the &quot;info freedom&quot; side.
<BR>
<P>This is certainly not good news to those who make their money by 
<BR>
monopolizing information and those who want to perform once and get paid 
<BR>
repeatedly for that performance.  But every revolution has casualties.  The 
<BR>
solution is adapt or perish.  And it is not necessarily as dire for artists 
<BR>
as it may sound.  Newspapers once had a lock on the news.  Then along came 
<BR>
radio, then TV, and now the net, where you can access all the news that's 
<BR>
fit to print anytime you want, for free.  But there are several newspaper 
<BR>
companies in this country who still make their money selling newspapers.  It 
<BR>
may not be easy, but it can be done, by focusing your efforts at those 
<BR>
consumers who are willing to pay for &quot;value added&quot; product even though it 
<BR>
may be available in a less convenient way or place for free.
