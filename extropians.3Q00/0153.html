It should be possible to put together software which at least alerts the
<BR>
user of the presence of webbugs; scans HTML of the website, kicks up a stink
<BR>
if it sees 1x1 gifs which are from a different server to other content (esp
<BR>
the page itself), esp if it sees doubleclick's (or other big ad agencies)
<BR>
server refered to. By then it is too late of course, unless you can put a
<BR>
filter between your browser and the net, which can strip out that kind of
<BR>
crap before the browser gets hold of the page and goes asking for gif. Is
<BR>
that possible?
<BR>
<P>I must say I'm most impressed by the technique of putting the bugs in email,
<BR>
to marry together your machine's cookie with your email address. Very sweet.
<BR>
<P>There must be loads of ways to deal with cookies; one would be to make
<BR>
software which detects (just by polling infrequently) when certain org's
<BR>
cookies turn up, and lets you choose to have them erased immediately/after a
<BR>
short delay/when you decide to manually. So the double-click cookie turns
<BR>
up, for instance, then gets blown away say 10 minutes later. Might need to
<BR>
be smarter than that, on reflection, as that might often have the effect of
<BR>
logging you out of sites; not in the case of Doubleclick; you could deleted
<BR>
their stuff immediately, but many sites require cookies to function. That,
<BR>
after all, is the whole problem; how to allow the &quot;good&quot; cookies, without
<BR>
the baduns.
<BR>
<P>So you could have your cookies, and eat them too, yes?
<BR>
<P>I wonder whether it's worth worrying about that stuff. Probably it is; that
<BR>
must be what all that &quot;price of freedom is eternal vigilance&quot; hype is about.

<P><P><EM>&gt; The technique is that DoubleClick pays the adult site to put a 1x1 pixel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invisible graphic on their site. When your browser hits the site, it also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loads the graphic which is served from DoubleClick's servers so your
</EM><BR>
browser
<BR>
<EM>&gt; also sends your DoubleClick cookie (you do have one, don't you?) to them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; along with a referrer URL in the HTTP request that DoubleClick can then
</EM><BR>
use
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to know what site you are at currently.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any site you hit with a DoubleClick ad or other image is tracking you. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think they still claim that they will not link up your cookie with your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real name and other info that they also have in their databases, but who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trusts them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wish Netscape had a way to let me disable cookies to only certain web
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; servers or wildcards.

<EM>&gt; &gt; I found this on slashdot, so lots of you have probably seen it. It's
</EM><BR>
about web
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bugs; a method of monitoring who is viewing webpages when, which also
</EM><BR>
works
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with html email and new postings. I'm not surprised that this happens,
</EM><BR>
but I'm
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interested to see the exact techniques.
