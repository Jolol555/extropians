<EM>&gt; Name of the game is Effing Quale. (Well, maybe not, but I love the

phrase.)
<BR>
<P>??? got an explanation? Being on the bottom of the earth, and so upside down

all the time,  the blood pools in my head. This means I have trouble with

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Find transhumanism.  Find your fellow transhumanists.  Forge the bond.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Work to develop the tech.  Race against time to get it before you die,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and/or work on a scheme to get to the future (cryo) while preserving your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitive resources (your surviving transhumanist pals may be of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assistance here, so you socially challenged,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I-want-the-Jupiter-brain-all-to-myself-geek-boys might just want to

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right to the tech.  Fight the govt for your right to freedom.  Fight the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ruthless and mighty corporate competitors (or join them is that feels like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a winning strategy) for your place in the race.  Dodge/survive biowar,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanowar, old paradigm revanchists, rogue ai/si, ill-chosen strategies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-enhancement, and finally, the siren perils of the galactic vastness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Onward!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In an ordinary game when you lose, you--the game character-- very often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; die.  Then you --the game player--go to a saved version of the game--if
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; were mindful to make one--and resume play.  In this game, the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functionality would be required of course, but your &quot;return&quot; to the game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could be &quot;explained&quot; as the consequence of having &gt;H &quot;life
</EM><BR>
insurance--saved
<BR>
<EM>&gt; backups of yourself.  If the game consists partly in learning what a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhuman is, how to think like one, and how to act like one, then early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on in the game you discover there is no &quot;save game&quot; functionality.  In its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place you must learn to equip yourself with a synaptic inventory-and-state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorder /transmitter--a &gt;H &quot;flight data recorder&quot;(&gt;Hfdr)--which records
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and broadcasts updates of your vital identity data to a remote secure data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven.  In the event of lethal misadventure that you see coming, there's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; final burst transmission which gives you, upon &quot;reboot&quot; into your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reinstantiated self, a high definition replay--complete with optional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; true-fidelity physical discomfort metric--of your most recent terminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; screw-up.  If on the other hand, you get terminated so abruptly that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data record is truncated, then you might have to make do with your most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent data update.  If it were particularly important to your future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; success that you have a detailed record, then you might upgrade yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a whoopass robust &gt;Hfdr,  go back to the scene of your last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deanimation, and sift through the debris for your last &quot;flight data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recorder&quot;.  Or, you could just send a remote.  Naaah.  You got backups,
</EM><BR>
use
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 'em.  Toss another shrimp on the barby, *be* the shrimp.  Onward!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>I like all this stuff. I was going to suggest something like that actually;
<BR>
a race-for-singularity game. Mostly it'd be a race for technology, with lots
<BR>
of feedback between types of technologies (eg: nano and ai), and lots of
<BR>
room for more-than-exponential growth; for instance, getting the tech to
<BR>
make uploads of a certain calibre might allow you to make uploads who
<BR>
substantially reduce cost/time to increase upload tech. You know the drill.
<BR>
<P>Of course, to make it truly realistic, you want to upgrade the *players'*
<BR>
minds as higher tech is discovered, which would have an effect on tactics.
<BR>
Wishes.
<BR>
<P>By the way, the idea of save-games as personality backups is investigated
<BR>
nicely in the RPG Paranoia. In it, you are a stored in the central computer
<BR>
(an insane, all powerful AI), and a new clone is produced when you die.
<BR>
Further, there is a social structure, much like a caste system; the computer
<BR>
rates you when you die, and reincarnates you into the social structure it
<BR>
thinks you deserve (I think this is accurate; it's all second hand, I never
<BR>
played paranoia). A very cool concept (but I wouldn't want to live there).
<BR>
<P>Lots of people here have great ideas on this; let's hear some more.
