<EM>&gt; There are six or seven gun axioms that are carved on the lining of my skull.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of them:  never assume in a situation that if you are armed, you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remain armed.  Important corollaries:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Don't enter a situation armed that you wouldn't be comfortable entering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    unarmed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Have a fallback plan in case you are disarmed, your weapon fails, or you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    run out of ammunition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A related axiom is never have a gun for self-defense unless you are ready,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing, and able emotionally and technically to kill someone.  You *cannot*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say &quot;I'll just point it at them but I wouldn't really shoot&quot; or &quot;I'll just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wound them.&quot;  If you feel that way, don't get a gun.  You're needlessly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; endangering yourself and others.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just so. However, I don't think many people would be interested or able to face
<BR>
an armed rapist or killer unarmed in any circumstances. Having a backup is
<BR>
always good, even if you are not disarmed of your primary weapon by the perp,
<BR>
there is always a matter of jams and misfires. There is also a matter of
<BR>
circumstances. For example, I may normally carry a 9 mm autoloader under my arm,
<BR>
however if I expect to take of my jacket, or don't expect it and have to (heat,
<BR>
humidity, etc) I want to be able to lock that firearm securely in my vehicle,
<BR>
office, or home and still be armed with my smaller more compact backups. As it
<BR>
is, I can be in a swim suit and t-shirt and still be armed if I have to, with
<BR>
nobody the wiser. Layering your weaponry is like layering clothing.
<BR>
<P>Any weapon you carry you MUST be willing to use. Visualize using in various
<BR>
circumstances. Determine what are appropriate weapons for you, what you are
<BR>
comfortable with, and under what circumstances. My own looks like this:
<BR>
<P>wilderness: .44 cap and ball revolver, or .44 magnum revolver, or 9mm
<BR>
autoloader, open carry
<BR>
<P>general public: 9mm, .22 magnum backup, knife or mace/pepper secondary backup,
<BR>
heavy duty zip ties, all concealed.
<BR>
<P>light clothing: .22 magnum, knife or mac/pepper backup, heavy duty zip ties, all
<BR>
concealed typically, though .22 magnum may be open carry depending on model
<BR>
used.
<BR>
<P>swimming: knife or fists, w/ pepper spray backup
<BR>
<P>NOTE: There are many circumstances where you will not feel the need to be armed
<BR>
to these levels. Living here in northern NH, I typically don't feel like I need
<BR>
to be armed, though I always do in the woods, as bear and moose can be
<BR>
agressive.
<BR>
<P>What is with the zip ties, you ask? If you detain a perp, with or without
<BR>
wounding them, you will need to detain them until help arrives. Sitting there
<BR>
and watching them constantly can be difficult, especially if you are in a
<BR>
dangerous area, you don't have eyes in the back of your head. Make your job
<BR>
easer. Black heavy duty zip ties, at least 12-16&quot; long, are excellent compact
<BR>
devices for detaining a perp. Get them on the ground. Have them zip their own
<BR>
legs up then roll over on their bellies with hands behind their back and have
<BR>
them start the zip tie themselves until they cannot do any more, then grab the
<BR>
end and pull quickly to cinch it up fast before they get a chance to try
<BR>
anything (step or kneel on their back while you do this, use your weight to help
<BR>
immobilize them, and keep the muzzle of your gun in contact with the core of
<BR>
their body). Then check the tie on the feet. DO NOT feel sympathetic when they
<BR>
whine about pain, circulation, etc. That is their problem they brought on
<BR>
themselves, and they are typically just conning you, trying to gain the
<BR>
advantage back.
<BR>
<P>These ties can be bought in most hardware stores, and they roll up nicely in a
<BR>
compact bundle too. They are very popular with cops on big busts in place of
<BR>
handcuffs.
<BR>
<P>This is really helpful when you are in a jurisdiction that frowns on private
<BR>
citizens exercising their constitutional rights. Once they are detained, it is
<BR>
much easier for you to dispose of any questionable weaponry you may not want
<BR>
confiscated by overzealous cops. Its also good if you are in a situation where
<BR>
you subdue two attackers. Unlikely, but it does happen.
<BR>
<P>I do NOT recommend mace or pepper spray as a primary weapon. It is only a backup
<BR>
that is useful for regaining the advantage in a confrontation. When it is all
<BR>
you have in hand, you better be prepared and able to use your bare hands or
<BR>
knife effectively as your primary weapon. Use the spray to screw up the other
<BR>
guys vision and ability to breath. Once that is done, drop it and use both
<BR>
hands. His adrenaline rush will work to your advantage.
<BR>
<P>Do not count what I say here as 'training' of any sort. Actual practice in the
<BR>
real world using your selected weapons cannot be substituted. Join a shooting
<BR>
club, take self defense courses, etc. PRACTICE: Shooting, hand to hand, knife
<BR>
fighting, as well as subduing and detaining.
