<EM>&gt; &gt; Gods (or Godesses) aren't going to help us where we are going. Get over

<EM>&gt;Don't be simplistic.  I'm not, nor is this topic.  Some of the impulses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sentiments, feelings, ideals, ideas behind religions are also to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;found driving humanity in the sciences.  That very desire to transcend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that burns so bright in all of us for instance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I understand it is uncomfortable to think along these lines.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understand very well as I have fought with such things often in my life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But do not underestimate the importance of the various images of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Transcendence to the type of work we are embarked on.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't imagine that any of the world religions have a lock on any sort of 
<BR>
real &quot;supernatural&quot; ontology.  But I always get kick out of atheists who 
<BR>
smugly claim that there is no god.  I don't claim that there is a god.  The 
<BR>
fact of the matter is that the data are inconclusive.  But there are some 
<BR>
things we do know: the universe is here; it got here somehow; and we don't 
<BR>
know how.
<BR>
<P>I realize that is not reason enough to claim that it must have been built by 
<BR>
Jehovah (Allah, Jesus, fill in the blank).  But some time back, before the 
<BR>
big bang, before the first of perhaps almost infinitely many big bangs, 
<BR>
there was a *first* cause.
<BR>
<P>Energy is conserved, meaning it is neither created nor destroyed.  Can that 
<BR>
mean that energy and/or matter have *always* existed?  Is that any easier to 
<BR>
believe than the story that God has always existed?  Not for me.  Don't get 
<BR>
me wrong, I no longer believe in the God I was taught about in Sunday 
<BR>
school.  But in light of the number and fundamentality of the unanswerable 
<BR>
questions, I can't see how one could claim with any sort of certainty that 
<BR>
God does not exist.
