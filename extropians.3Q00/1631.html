</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;occur when you have taken your civilization to the highest possible levels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because that is the only way you can defend yourself if you piss someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;off. ... When I look out into the galaxy, I don't expect to see the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who reproduced and colonized the most -- I expect to see the smartest people.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think your argument comes down to assuming the universe is pretty fully
<BR>
colonized, with high powers near each location, but that such powers pretty
<BR>
universally make themselves very dark, do not touch the bright things we see
<BR>
near them, and aggressively squash anything that comes to touch them.  It is
<BR>
this last assumption that is most difficult to swallow.
<BR>
<P>After all, if there were dark powers everywhere that didn't care if you used
<BR>
the bright things near them, then colonization waves could pass through the
<BR>
universe just using the bright things, and staying clear of dark powers.
<BR>
Whether you can see if a galaxy is colonized with dark things is irrelevant
<BR>
in this case.
