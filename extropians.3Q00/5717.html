<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;Are you suggesting that a government can be a democracy without having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;protection for the rights of minorities?  Does that mean you do not have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;have respect for a minorities lives or property??  How about their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;rights?  Can you respect their lives without respecting their property?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;about an artist or writer's right to their work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Absolutely.  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then was the Nazi Party in Germany which seems to have been supported by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of the people a Democracy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it came to power in a very Clintonian manner. It never won a majority
<BR>
of the vote, although it won the largest minority. Von Hindenberg could not get
<BR>
a center-right majority coalition formed in parliament without the Nazis, and he
<BR>
thought he could manipulate Hitler, so he appointed him chancellor and gave him
<BR>
the chance to form a government. They won the next election, then started losing
<BR>
in the polls, so they staged their takeover before the election after that. Note
<BR>
also that Hitler made himself look like a 'good' Nazi by purging Roehm and his
<BR>
brownshirt extremists. Then the German ambassador to France was shot, allegedly
<BR>
by a jewish anarchist, in Paris, and that triggered Kristallnacht.
<BR>
<P>After Hitler ran the Roehm purge, he had arrested any MP that opposed him,
<BR>
rammed through the emergency decree, and that ended democracy. He kept a rubber
<BR>
stamp Reichstag around for appearances sake.
