<EM>&gt; payday.  How shameful that he isn't paid out even more when he quits!

<P>No, excuse me?  Where do you think part of the 25-30% of your paycheck goes?  Or
<BR>
are you one of those people who is taking home 100% of the money earned?  If so
<BR>
please tell me how I can do this.  Since I currently work on commission, the
<BR>
government has seen fit to take an *additional* 28% out of my paycheck every two
<BR>
weeks, supposedly on the notion that I make more money than the average joe.  If
<BR>
only this were true.  Sure at the end of the year they realize their oversight
<BR>
and I get some of it back.
<BR>
<P>I personally have never been on unemployment, but I do know that you the most you
<BR>
can possibly get back is less than $10/hour of which is in turned taxed again!
<BR>
So everybody is paying IN to the unemployment system, and much less in being paid
<BR>
out, meaning the government is making a small profit on everyone.  How shameful
<BR>
that you have been so privileged as to never been at the mercy of a brutal job
<BR>
market or tyrannical boss.  What is the world coming to indeed!
