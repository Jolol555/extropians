I've heard some very nasty things about the company that makes the brown
<BR>
fizzy drink and dead union officials, and certain pumped up shoe makers have
<BR>
had their butts whipped in recent years over sweat shop labour. There's
<BR>
always the baby formula manufacturer, who's name shall remain nestle'd in
<BR>
secrecy, that employs (or at least used to employ) dastardly tactics to move
<BR>
third world mums from breastfeeding to formula, thus causing the deaths of
<BR>
many tiny tots due to direct exposure to the rotten local drinking water, or
<BR>
else starvation due to inability to afford the stuff (thanks for the
<BR>
mamaries). Or you might mention a certain org beloved of closer circles
<BR>
which thinks it's ok to make food seed with an off-switch (or which, more
<BR>
accurately I think, requires secret gunk to turn it on).
<BR>
<P>But I think the only crime against humanity that MS has perpetrated is VB.
<BR>
The bastards!

<EM>&gt;     &gt; How about what was done to US citizens of Japanese ancestry during

the
