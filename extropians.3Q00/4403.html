<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	but then aren't we enslaved by &quot;the best&quot;? enslaved by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very condition of our being?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can one consider knowing, absolutely, what is best, and
<BR>
absolutely and deterministically always being able to chose and get it
<BR>
as &quot;enslaved&quot;?  One cannot chose, that which he does not want, it
<BR>
makes no logical sense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; most human beings want sex, yet many feel enslaved by this desire.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, now we're branching out to something a bit
<BR>
different.  Our creator (evolution I believe) has hard wired powerful
<BR>
sexual joys to the stimulus of sexual behavior.  In other words, if we
<BR>
do certain sexual acts, we receive the reward of phenomenal sexual
<BR>
pleasure.  Of course, having some puppet master besides ourselves hard
<BR>
wire such strings isn't free agency at all.  Only when we can cut and
<BR>
rewire such strings, such that we can want what we want to want, or
<BR>
rewire ourselves to receive phenomenal joys for the stimulus which we
<BR>
choose, can one truly be free.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won't it be great when we can make undesirable things like
<BR>
paper work (or anything else we'd like to do but now hate doing) be
<BR>
orgasmick or better?  ;) Now that'll be true freedom!  Imagine how
<BR>
much we'll all get done with such abilities to want what we want to
<BR>
want, and not what our creator hard wired us to want!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, anything that makes us deviate from that which we
<BR>
really want, even if it is hard wired pleasures, it destroys ones
<BR>
freedom and makes them a slave to whatever is causing them to deviate
<BR>
from choosing and getting what they really want right!?
