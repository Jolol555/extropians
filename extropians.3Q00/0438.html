<P><EM>&gt; I've heard of people with perfect marriages, but I don't think I've ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  actually met any.  I had a friend, M, who's dead now so I'm sure she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wouldn't mind if I write about her. She was around 20 years older than I,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and everyone held her marriage up as an exemplary marriage, as proof that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  marriage DID work sometimes.  Her husband was devoted to her.  One evening 
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  was sitting around talking to her, and she said (out of the blue it 
</EM><BR>
seemed),
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;Bonnie, you know, I've hated being married.  It's like I've never lived.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  But I didn't know what else to DO!  Getting married is what women DID in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  day!&quot;  I almost cry now thinking about her wasted life.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've heard this kind of story a few times. The same deal happened to one 
<BR>
of my Aunts. She fell in love with her first serious boyfriend, got married, 
<BR>
had kids a dog etc. They always seemed like the perfect family, they had a 
<BR>
nice car, very nice house and moved to a bigger and better house every couple 
<BR>
of years. They were the envy of the whole family.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after about 13 years of marriage she left because she hadn't lived 
<BR>
and wanted more out of life. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, she remarried in about a year and now has kids, a dog etc 
<BR>
etc. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a moral in there somewhere. Personally I love being 
<BR>
married and this is my second time. My marriage is far from perfect, but it 
<BR>
certainly is fun.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex
