<EM>&gt; No, it doesn't. You and I don't have the same auto insurance or health care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policies, do we? Yet we still get along fine, and nobody is sending other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people's kids to their deaths over car insurance, are they? The only common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreement by individuals in society is for each individual to respect and honor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the contracts they agree to with other individuals, and to not initiate force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against others. You and I don't have to want to exercise the same rights, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long as those rights either don't conflict, or don't conflict without just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compensation. If I carry a firearm, and you don't, you are externalizing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security risk onto me to include you in the security umbrella that the implied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threat my being armed provides (and the presence of a weapon does not constitute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of force, BTW). Such a scenario can be easily mitigated by a system of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bounties or rewards in those instances when I do in fact take concrete actions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to provide you with protection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>So, to take a classic case, what happens when your security/law
<BR>
enforcement body decides to haul me away on some charge that makes since
<BR>
to your law making agency but my law making agency and security/law
<BR>
enforcement utterly disagrees?  Who decides the issue?  Do they fight it
<BR>
out?  What next level body and set of rules do they appeal to?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I do not see how multiplying the number of private law providers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enforcers actually makes life and cooperative, predicatable activity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more likely.  On the surface it seems to add extra levels of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complication.  Problems that did have on central body of law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arbitrators now have N such bodies.  These bodies act similarly to small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; States in this respect.  So domestic conflicts are escalated into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; international (er, inter-syndicate?) ones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Socialists do not see how multiplying the number of private product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturers and distributors actually makes life better, more cooperative and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more efficient for all, which is why they simply DO NOT GET capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Predictability is irrelevant, unless you are a fascist control freak. Adding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complexity to systems (like markets) makes them more robust. Having n bodies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law ensures that if any one fails to serve adequately, the market for private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law will resolve the issue bloodlessly, allowing consumers to obtain their law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from bodies of law which do provide adequate levels of justice.
</EM><BR>
<P>Arguing from analogy does nothing to address the point raised. 
<BR>
Predictability of a reasonable degree is quite relevant if you want a
<BR>
generally sane and peaceful society where conflicts do not become armed
<BR>
conflicts too often.  Calling names is even weaker than using
<BR>
inapplicable analogies.
