Robert &amp; Michael.
<BR>
<P>But shouldn't an Extropian be a survivalist? Shouldn't he/she look at worse
<BR>
case scenarios and plan for those too?
<BR>
<P>I'm not really scared of catastrophes... but I'm scared of not including
<BR>
them in my planning.
<BR>
<P>Surely there are those among us who have a real personal survival agenda...
<BR>
I subscribe to MURG; I'm doing my humanscale cognitive software... I'm on
<BR>
the various LE lists... good gosh I get 400 - 500 pieces of mail a day!
<BR>
<P>I'd surely like to join an LE group that's not trying to sell me something
<BR>
other than empirical soundness.
<BR>
<P>But where does an Extropian/Transhuman who's seriously into this stuff go
<BR>
for actual implementation... or do we STILL have to play a wait-and-see
<BR>
game?
<BR>
<P>I mean this in all sincerity. I decided on my course of action in the very
<BR>
late sixties... I retire (as planned) in 2001 to do all the neat stuff. So
<BR>
three decades have shown that at least I'm persistent.
<BR>
<P>Surely there are others... we can't all be waiting for our respective ships
<BR>
to come in?

<EM>&gt;&gt; MICHAEL SAID: &quot;...Revival WILL be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; acheived some day, and the revival priority will most likely be a 'last
</EM><BR>
in,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; first out' regimen, as the most recent cryonauts will likely be the
</EM><BR>
easiest
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; revive, so I don't think the statements of post mortem bravery posted
</EM><BR>
here
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the list have much risk of being called upon at some future date....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; CYMM SAYS: I really wish I had such faith... I'm not even sure that our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; cirrent civilization is robust enough to withstand the slings &amp; arrows of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; the 21st Century. There is far too much interdependence and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; overpopulation... a descent to a &quot;lower&quot; level of civilization would
</EM><BR>
provoke
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; mass death &amp; and huge loss of technological knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The followers of Dr. Mathus thought, in the 1800's, that we would have long
</EM><BR>
ago
<BR>
<EM>&gt;reached the dismal state you describe. Guess what? No such luck. As time
</EM><BR>
goes on
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I am less and less concerned with the bleats and brays of the naysayers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;luddites. They are a pain, but they are engineering their own obsolescence
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;marginalization.
