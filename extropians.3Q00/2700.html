<P><EM>&gt; The yield of the process is 100%: you need a lot of energy to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ethanol but the energy consumed needn't have been from ethanol.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the yield is 2.9E16 BTU, with a requirement for 1.7E16 input.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, I intentionally calculated it closed loop style, so a gallon of ethanol
<BR>
per bushel is a pretty good estimate methinks.  I shoulda converted it
<BR>
into realistic units for the rest of the world.  Hell, *I* dont even know
<BR>
how much a bushel is.  But we could go to liters and hectares, since
<BR>
a hectare is (I think) a square 100 meters on a side, so theres about
<BR>
256 hectares to the square mile and 640 acres to the square mile
<BR>
(Im doing this all from memory so do be kind if I blow the conversion)
<BR>
so we figured about 150 gallons per acre year, so
<BR>
<P>150 gal/acre * 3.87 liters / gal * 640 acres / 256 hectare ~ 1450
<BR>
liters/hectare.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, we could probably do better.  From the site you reference,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.stinker.com/ethanol/corn.html">http://www.stinker.com/ethanol/corn.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plants produce a lot of cellulose, so yields could be far higher than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for corn *if* we pay more for the ethanol (the site doesn't say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *how* much more) or if we develop cost-effective fermentation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That said, we'd still need an awful lot of land...
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, but we have it.  We are sitting here on a big empty country and
<BR>
we throw countless zettaliters of fresh water into the sea every day.
<BR>
We really should stop doing that.  And we can GM the corn to
<BR>
make more fuel.
<BR>
<P>That being said, the same land could be used to set up windmills
<BR>
too.  Windmills and cornfields should cohabitate nicely.  spike
