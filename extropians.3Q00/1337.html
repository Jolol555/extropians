The systems described here are NOT anonymous; a truly
<BR>
anonymous transaction requires untraceability for both
<BR>
parties. Depositing the money (or digicash, or
<BR>
whatever) reveals that you have received funds, and
<BR>
also makes it theoretically possible for the
<BR>
transaction to be traced by the amount and the time of
<BR>
the transaction. Also, of course, there is the
<BR>
possibility (if not probability) of hidden information
<BR>
in the instrument itself.
<BR>
<P>CASH is the only truly anonymous and widely-accepted
<BR>
instrument of negotiation--and then only until it hits
<BR>
a bank.
<BR>
<P>Sorry.

<P>&gt; Anonymous e-cash is, indeed, dead... but I have hope
that it will be
&gt; reborn.
&gt; 
&gt; The most potent e-cash system was invented by David
Chaum.  It died
&gt; when he decided that his anonymous e-cash program
would be the ticket
&gt; to making him rich.  (Of course, those who
understand e-cash realize
&gt; that it's not a way to get rich; it's a way to
provide unmatched
&gt; benefits to consumers.  But I digress.)  He patented
blind signatures,
&gt; the process of writing your signature on something
you can't read.
&gt; This allowed entities who functioned as &quot;banks&quot; to
sign money orders
&gt; without reading the order.  That way, you could
later present the bank
&gt; with a signed money order, and the bank would have
no way of telling
&gt; from whom you got the money.  You could easily send
the money orders
&gt; via e-mail.  He also patented a mechanism to prevent
people from
&gt; trying to reuse money orders they've already spent. 
He then signed up
&gt; with one tiny bank in Louisiana, and, with all the
naivete you might
&gt; expect from a man who spends lots of time thinking
about encryption
&gt; protocols, started his proprietary Digicash system,
expecting the
&gt; world to beat a path to his door.
&gt; 
&gt; To his surprise, they didn't.  Oddly enough, people
didn't want to buy
&gt; and trade currency that they could only use at one
bank, and which
&gt; almost no merchants would accept.  Nor would
merchants accept the
&gt; currency when they had to pay Digicash money and
retool their
&gt; already-working credit card payment systems in order
to accept it.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, Chaum's patent will run out in a few years. 
At that time,
&gt; expect to see a free version of Chaum's Digicash
system proliferating;
&gt; one that anybody can download and use.  You can even
be your own
&gt; &quot;bank&quot; (in the Digicash sense) simply by proving
that you have some
&gt; money and publicly signing an agreement to transfer
that money to
&gt; anyone presenting you with a valid coin.
&gt; 
&gt; An interesting point to note is that e-cash does NOT
have to die
&gt; simply because governments pass laws saying that
overseas transfers of
&gt; money may not be anonymous.  If Alice in America
wants to send money
&gt; to Bob in Britain anonymously, she can use something
analogous to a
&gt; cypherpunk remailer system.  Alice sends e-cash to
her &quot;bank&quot; in
&gt; America, along with instructions to send that e-cash
onwards to Bob's
&gt; (pseudonymous, if neccesary) address in Britain. 
That American bank
&gt; knows the identity of a bank in Britain, and legally
sends the money
&gt; to the British bank, along with Alice's instructions
to send e-cash to
&gt; Bob's address.  The British bank receives the e-cash
and sends e-cash
&gt; to Bob.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, governments *could* make this system
illegal by saying that
&gt; NO transfers of money may be anonymous, overseas or
not.  Of course,
&gt; they'd never do that, right?
