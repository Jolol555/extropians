<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm planning to talk about virtual reality: how teleworking may become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; popular when VR gets good enough that you can get those social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interactions with office mates that seem to be so essential. When that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stage is reached (I'm reckon this could implemented on a large scale in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about fifteen years) then there seems to be no reason why anybody who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works only with information would need to be physically present in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; office. Life guards on beaches etc. are a different matter, since it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubtful that robots will be good enough and cheap enough to replace
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manual labour within that time scale.
</EM><BR>
<P>We had an interesting thread here a few days ago about using tele-operated
<BR>
robots for vacation or business purposes.  Combining your VR at work
<BR>
idea suggests wheeled robots roaming the halls, a monitor on the front
<BR>
with your smiling face in place, camera mounted so that it can interact
<BR>
with people and it's just like being there.  You could go to meetings,
<BR>
and the table would have some chairs and some spaces for the wheeled
<BR>
robots to roll up to.  Maybe you could even put an arm on the robot and
<BR>
it could carry a coffee cup or shake hands with important clients.
<BR>
<P>See <A HREF="http://www.irobot.com">http://www.irobot.com</A> for something that could evolve into this.  It's
<BR>
got the wheels, it's got the camera (with a wireless webcam interface).
<BR>
Just add a monitor or at least a speaker so you can talk through it
<BR>
(you could paste your picture on the front) and you're all set.  Maybe
<BR>
just a cell phone with a speaker phone attachment?
<BR>
<P>I might even get one and try to get the office up in SJ to let it wander
<BR>
around.  The biggest problem would be getting the IS department to open
<BR>
up the corporate firewall for the webcam.
