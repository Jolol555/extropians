<P><EM>&gt; Experiment demonstrates that psychotherapy produces results slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  worse than a control group in which patients just talk to a random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  person for an hour.

<P><EM>&gt;  Please give your source 
</EM><BR>
<P>Never mind siting the source, I read that post and even if that study did 
<BR>
occur, it was googley eyes!!
<BR>
<P>What we call therapy (whether it's mental or physical) for one hour is pretty 
<BR>
much useless. Except maybe for suicide intervention, if they lock someone up.
<BR>
<P>One hour of therapy *would* make people feel worse. 
<BR>
(I assume results are based on interviewing the subjects on how they felt)
<BR>
<P>Like an injury, after one hour of therapy the wound is left aggravated. 
<BR>
Stiffness would set in, and maybe even damage could've been done. 
<BR>
<P>Therapy (of any kind) implies a long-term goal and progressive, 
<BR>
individualized treatments that require commitment of the patient and 
<BR>
therapist..... rehabilitation, recuperation... the patient takes many twists 
<BR>
and turns. It is almost impossible to get a linear measurement of recovery. 
<BR>
That is where the term 'one step forward one step back' seems most 
<BR>
appropriate.
<BR>
<P>On top of that, results are not 'hard science' measurable at all , since they 
<BR>
are usually done by interview..... and they involve subjective evaluations of 
<BR>
self-behaviors, which include self-deceptions, rationalizations.. and they 
<BR>
are measuring the 'greyer than grey' areas of our  feelings and emotional 
<BR>
well being. They have found way to see who' better or worse. Objectively ?
<BR>
<P>(UH -- not to mention: a &quot;control group&quot; that involves people's feeling is 
<BR>
pretty uncontrolled, can you tell me the hormone count of both of the entire 
<BR>
groups that day?; - )
<BR>
<P><P>Thera-pee works over time... and in tangent.... it's a partnership.... 
<BR>
When signs of gradual improvement occurs,  a new training is introduced and 
<BR>
progress is measured slowly and over many months. Different types of therapy 
<BR>
are tried, some working ....some not. Coping tools are introduced over time, 
<BR>
and support is removed as the subject grows stronger.
<BR>
<P><P>I am not saying YOU need therapy, E, from all accounts you're a perfect 
<BR>
specimen of emotionally well adjusted youth, but = ) don't discount it for 
<BR>
all the rest of us - at least not on acount a' that silly test
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>With love to all, me back from work hell.... 
<BR>
Nadia
<BR>
<P><P>PS: I like the 'improvements' thread...
<BR>
<P><P><P>PS
<BR>
In the summer time time
<BR>
when the weather is fine 
<BR>
you can reach right up and touch sky 
<BR>
: ) : ) : )
<BR>
<P><P>we are hap-hap-py, life's for livin' that is my philosophy
