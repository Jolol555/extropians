<EM>&gt; &gt; I know you want to brush this one under the carpet, but I hope you'll
</EM><BR>
agree
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that the most obvious and most common assumptions are the ones most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resistant to change.  In the interests of constant improvement, even the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most fundamental pillars of belief, too, must be challenged.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think I know how you feel, Jason.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At five years old, I wanted to know *why* 2 + 2 = 4.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bertrand Russell wrote a huge book about it (_Principia Mathematica).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rather than write a book to prove that the set of all that exists equals
</EM><BR>
one
<BR>
<EM>&gt; set, I'll simply present it as axiomatic (like, 2 + 2 = 4).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't like to use the word &quot;axiom&quot; too loosely.  I like instead, to borrow
<BR>
from the Aristotelean and Objectivist usage of the term, to define it as a
<BR>
_universal truth_ -- i.e., something that underlies all other truths.  (This
<BR>
does not make it any more real.  The distinction between axioms and other
<BR>
truths (particular truths) is epistemological not ontological.)  Classic
<BR>
examples are the Law of Identity.
<BR>
<P>In particular, I believe one should avoid just taking what one knows to be
<BR>
true and reclassifying it as axiomatic.  For instance, my eye color, which I
<BR>
see every time I look in the mirror is not, for me, an axiom.  Surely, I
<BR>
know it.  I know it's true -- in the context of my knowledge.  But it is not
<BR>
an axiom.  It doesn't underly all of my knowledge.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is only one reality because reality means the (unitary) set of all
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; exists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (You won't be tested on this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but you'll need to know it to accurately solve more complex problems.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Jason Joel Thompson meant something more than that.  Though I agree
<BR>
with you that reality is unitary, I think he meant that the unification
<BR>
might only take place in the mind.  In other words, that collecting all real
<BR>
things into &quot;reality&quot; is no more than a mental shorthand and that
<BR>
metaphysically reality -- all the real things -- might be separate and
<BR>
unrelated.  I would take this to include stuff not perceived or known and
<BR>
therefore not unified by any mind.
<BR>
<P>Correct me if I'm wrong Jason.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I was worried about reality until I met William Shatner and we
<BR>
logged on to Priceline.com, but that's a song for another time.
<BR>
<P>Until then,
