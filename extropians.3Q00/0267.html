<P>
Waldemar Ingdahl has asked,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;What to do?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sincerely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Waldemar
</EM><BR>
<P>To dissociate extropy from &quot;nutty religion&quot; might involve a dash of humor along
<BR>
with sincerity.
<BR>
Why does this work? Because nothing seems quite as humorless as taking religion
<BR>
too seriously.
<BR>
Others have thought of the omega point before Tipler. Some ancients called it
<BR>
sahasrar.
<BR>
Still others fixate on the alpha point. But reality does not depend on such
<BR>
points, and neither does real transhumanity.
<BR>
<P>Pointless bumper stickers:
<BR>
Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.
<BR>
Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder.
<BR>
The more you complain, the longer God makes you live.
<BR>
IRS: We've got what it takes to take what you've got.
<BR>
Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?
<BR>
Honk If You Want To See My Finger
