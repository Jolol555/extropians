<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the 'Official' Red Hat CANNOT be reproduced, and I cannot sell or give away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the work of Red Hat (whether its their programming work or their Customer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Support work is really irrelevant, and a pointless distinction) without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; compensating them to the degree they desire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Utter nonsense. I can have all the same bits without the pretty box for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; free if I grab it off their ftp server, minus some non-free added value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; junk. I can install it on as many machines as I want, I can burn CDs and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pay you to take them from me, I can call it some thing else and start a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; company putting it a different box. (Witness Mandrake.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Calling the distinction between software and support pointless is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; insanity. The software is free, paying a human being to help you use it or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; adapt it to your purposes isn't. That's the whole freaking free-software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; business model - that's what RMS has been talking about for years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; SInce I work most of my time at a software company, I know there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; functionally no difference between the two.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't copy an engineer at zero cost - that's a rather important
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functional difference between software and support/maintenance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; All the 'free' business model is doing is some sort of hacker-leach
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lotus eating paradise, where people that know what they are doing get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the software for free, and the unit COST of producing that software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the distro distributor is externalized through the tech support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; process to make the clueless pay for the free software the geeks are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; using.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I write a piece of software and give it away, free of charge, to anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who can use it. I have things I'd rather spend my afternoon doing than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; setting it up on your PC but for a few bucks - sure - I'll give you a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obviously I'm a hacker-leach, victimizing the clueless.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you aren't. The people who don't hire you to help them are
<BR>
benefitting from the fact that you only bill the clueless for your time,
<BR>
thus the clueless are subsidizing the software of those who don't need
<BR>
help with it. What you are practicing is a reverse sort of technological
<BR>
socialism, where the people with the intellectual capital (the hackers)
<BR>
pay the least, while the intellectually poor (the newbie) pays the most.
<BR>
Its a highly regressive tax system, which is odd coming from people who
<BR>
tend to be socialists politically.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RedHat still has to pay its programmers to produce code. Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; making everyone pay their fair share of the cost of producing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; code that everyone benefits from, they make the newbies pay for it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux was built on support money, unfairly extracted from unjustly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burdened, exploited newbies? Gcc and the Gnu tool set? X-Windows? Kde and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gnome? Apache? What the hell are you talking about?
</EM><BR>
<P>Something that anyone with an ounce of understanding of how business
<BR>
work would understand.
