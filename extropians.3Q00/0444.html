The Back-Action hypothesis has been used, most prominently, by John Crammer, 
<BR>
physicist at the U of Washing who conceptualized that their is a back-wave 
<BR>
action at the Quantum level that effects the past in a subtle way, and 
<BR>
basically &quot;crystallizes in the present&quot;. One can get a flavor of this (in my 
<BR>
opinion) with reading Kurt Goedel's view of Reverse of Time in a Rotational 
<BR>
Universe (1949), as well as doing searches on New Scientist's website- 
<BR>
www.newscientist.com and see a couple of interesting articles that have been 
<BR>
produced in the last few years; search words hypertime, time reversal.

<P>&lt;&lt; Tipler's theory posits the future existence of a super-AI that uses the
<BR>
&nbsp;energy of gravitational sheer from a collapsing universe to achieve
<BR>
&nbsp;asymptotically increasing computing power (intelligence). This AI then
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;resurrects&quot; every person who has ever lived. This is accomplished by means
<BR>
&nbsp;of perfect emulations that dwell in subjective eternity in conditions of
<BR>
&nbsp;complete fulfillment (every dream coming true).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Tipler also asserts that this Omega Point intelligence is functionally
<BR>
&nbsp;equivalent to God, and that all the world's religions have somehow intuited
<BR>
&nbsp;that God *will be* (even if He does not now exist). Yet in a sense, Tipler
<BR>
&nbsp;would say that this Omega Point deity already exists because Tipler claims
<BR>
&nbsp;that It (or He) exerts back-action of the past in order to ensure His future
<BR>
&nbsp;coming into being. Yes, that's right, Tipler believes in the future
<BR>
&nbsp;affecting the past.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;If you want to know more, check out &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot; especially
<BR>
&nbsp;the quite detailed &quot;Appendix for Scientists&quot; that provide the mathematical
<BR>
&nbsp;physics behind Tipler's ideas. &gt;&gt;
