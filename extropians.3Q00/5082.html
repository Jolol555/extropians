<P><EM>&gt; If you consider abortion to be a &quot;necessary evil&quot; - morally

<EM>&gt; dubious but of great convenience to women - this might seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a compromise.  However, if you consider abortion to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethical the above solution is not ethical.

<P>Do you assume a fetus is a human being and has all the rights thereof? 
<BR>
At what stage of pregnancy do you assume this is so?  Is your argument
<BR>
for your choice of when this is so verifiable or objective?
<BR>
<P>Whatever else is in question around abortion one thing is not in
<BR>
question.  The pregnant woman IS a human being and has all rights of
<BR>
such including the right to choose whether and when to bear a chiled and
<BR>
to be a mother.  It is not quite possible at this time to always manage
<BR>
to exercise the choice to not get pregnant when you emphatically do not
<BR>
wish to bear a child.  As long as this is so and as long as women are
<BR>
considered more than breeding vessels they have every right to refuse to
<BR>
carry a fetus to term.  No one's belief that the fetus has as much
<BR>
rights as the woman and has so many rights that she should be forced to
<BR>
carry it regardless of her wishes and what it does to her and her life
<BR>
can be called in my book someone who believes in the &quot;right to life&quot;. 
<BR>
They believe in the right to enslave women.
