<P>
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is funding a feasibility study for a ground-based, fully steerable, 100 m optical telescope christened OWL (Over-Whelmingly Large) for its keen night vision.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
The project uses segmented primary and secondary mirrors and integrated active optics. 
<BR>
<P>Recent breakthroughs in optics and mechanical support structures, together with the knowledge gained of active optical control have encouraged astronomers to dream of bigger things. A 100 m telescope would mean major advances. 
<BR>
<P>Imagine measuring the Hubble constant with no local effects. OWL could measure &quot;standard candles&quot;, such as Cepheid variables, as far away as the Virgo cluster; supernovae could be seen up to a redshift of 10 and beyond; and with a large light-collecting area, observations of rapidly varying sources become possible and faint objects, such as planets, can be imaged directly.  Looking for planetary biospheres?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
However, the OWL study is still in an early phase. ESO's activities are currently focused on the completion of the Very Large Telescope and the ALMA project - an array of submillimetre antennae to be installed on Chajnantor in the Chilean Altiplano.
<BR>
<P>Current estimates suggest that OWL would cost around a thousand million euros. With a construction time of 
<BR>
about 12 years!!!
