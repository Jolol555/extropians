<EM>&gt; myself or anyone else and I am not related to Brian Atkins.  I simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the same not-that-uncommon last name.

<P>Would it be fair to ask how long until Atkins overtakes, say, Smith?
<BR>
^_-
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What else?  The pattern is a bit different in that I have strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; empathic abilities and a deep mystical streak.  I mainly and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully fight the latter these days and don't make that much use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the former.  But at one time I almost decided it was time to junk the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high-tech career and become the first Sister of the Church of the Holy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nanite.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well...you don't have to fight it.  Empathy can give you insight into
<BR>
human nature...and to the best of our knowledge, which species built all
<BR>
this high tech stuff that we're working with?  Guessing based on, &quot;if I
<BR>
was a typical programmer/system designer/whatever I know the maker of
<BR>
what I'm faced with was, how would I have set this up,&quot; has saved me
<BR>
much time in the past.  That is one of the things that sets applied
<BR>
computer science apart from, say, chemical engineering.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What can I say?  I have an intermittenly over-active
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God-module.
</EM><BR>
<P>You try to be God sometimes, too?  ^_^
