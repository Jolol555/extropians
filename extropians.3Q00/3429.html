<P>Study: Biotech Corn Kills Monarch
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genetically engineered corn designed to kill an insect
<BR>
pest spreads enough of its pollen on nearby weeds to kill monarch
<BR>
butterflies, researchers said Monday in the latest study on the biotech
<BR>
crop's environmental effects. 
<BR>
<P>Iowa State University scientists found that one in five monarch larvae died
<BR>
after being exposed to the toxic corn pollen for two days. Three days after
<BR>
the initial two-day exposure more than half of the larvae died. 
<BR>
<P>``In the field you may have higher mortality rates because of the cumulative
<BR>
effect of being exposed to the toxin throughout the larval stage,'' said
<BR>
researcher John Obrycki, whose study appears in the Internet edition of the
<BR>
journal Oecologia. ``Coming up with a good ecological assessment of this
<BR>
technology probably needed to be done before planting it across the
<BR>
Midwest.'' 
<BR>
<P>The biotech corn, known as Bt corn for a bacterium gene that makes it toxic
<BR>
to the European corn borer, became controversial last year after a
<BR>
laboratory study at Cornell University showed it was toxic to monarch
<BR>
butterflies. 
<BR>
<P>The corn's pollen coats the leaves of nearby milkweed plants that butterfly
<BR>
caterpillars eat. 
<BR>
<P>The Cornell finding produced a public outcry in Europe and calls from
<BR>
environmental groups to curb the spread of gene-altered crops, but biotech
<BR>
supporters have criticized that study and the one from Iowa State for being
<BR>
unrealistic. 
<BR>
<P>``Much of what (the Iowa State study) reports is based on analyses taking
<BR>
place in laboratory manipulations rather than field conditions,'' said Val
<BR>
Giddings, vice president of food and agriculture for the Biotechnology
<BR>
Industry Organization. 
<BR>
<P>The Iowa State researchers planted breeds of biotech corn that produced
<BR>
different levels of the insecticide pollen along with some corn that hadn't
<BR>
been engineered. They then placed potted milkweed plants at varying
<BR>
distances from the fields. After two or three days they took the milkweed
<BR>
plants into the lab and exposed the butterflies to the plant leaves. 
<BR>
<P>Significant numbers of butterflies died after exposure to leaves coated with
<BR>
pollen, while those placed with leaves that were washed or unexposed to the
<BR>
Bt pollen died at a normal rate. 
<BR>
<P>Giddings said butterfly caterpillars are unlikely to encounter the pollen in
<BR>
nature in any great numbers and that the monarch butterfly population
<BR>
increased almost as much as the plantings of Bt corn last year. 
<BR>
<P>An estimated 19 percent of the 80 million acres of corn growing this year
<BR>
was Bt. 
<BR>
<P>Environmental groups have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to
<BR>
have farmers surround fields of Bt corn with buffer zones of conventional
<BR>
corn to prevent the pollen from spreading to milkweed. 
<BR>
<P>``Continued inaction would clearly be lethal to monarch butterflies,'' said
<BR>
Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist at Environmental Defense, a group critical of
<BR>
genetically engineered crops. 
<BR>
<P>The EPA has been reviewing its standard for biotech crops and plans to
<BR>
release recommendations in September, said Steve Johnson, deputy assistant
<BR>
administrator of the office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. 
<BR>
<P>Early this year the EPA put new planting restrictions on Bt corn to prevent
<BR>
insects from developing resistance to the toxin. The restrictions require
<BR>
farmers to plant at least 20 percent conventional corn in most regions, and
<BR>
50 percent in areas where cotton is grown. 
<BR>
<P>In June, University of Illinois scientists placed black swallowtail
<BR>
butterflies near a farmer's field and found no evidence that they were
<BR>
harmed by the biotech corn. The swallowtail is considered less sensitive to
<BR>
the corn toxin than the monarch, but is more likely to be exposed to the
<BR>
pollen. 
<BR>
<P>************************************
<BR>
<P>Can anyone point me to where this &quot;research&quot; is being published? I'd like to
<BR>
actually see the methodology. Specifically, what does &quot;exposure&quot; mean?
