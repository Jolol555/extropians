<P><EM>&gt;Bush many not be much better, but he's more of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'lesser evil' type candidate, because he is for preserving our individual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability to defend our liberty, even though he may not be for every 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual liberty we support. While someone like Harry Browne comes closer 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than most every other candidate to most extropian values, his practical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability to win the election is about as good as a blind quadrapelegics 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chance of hitting a bull's butt with a bass fiddle, and Gore actually has a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decent risk of winning this election despite himself. In this case its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rather obvious what a 'rational' choice to make is for an extropian: put 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bush in the white house.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not originally my observation or argument, but it's a very good 
<BR>
point.
<BR>
The most successful third party to ever exist was the socialist party. They 
<BR>
never won a major election, but the points they were pushing ealy in this 
<BR>
century are supported by both the democrats and republicans today, some of 
<BR>
which is very good and most of which is very bad (we have social security, 
<BR>
legalized birth control, a graduated income tax, a union-friendly 
<BR>
government, a minimum wage.. etc. I'm not sure which of these were official 
<BR>
Socialist positions but I'm sure they are all things most Socialists of the 
<BR>
period would have supported or been concerned about). If people had voted 
<BR>
consistenly for major parties, this would not have happened. And if a 
<BR>
Libertarian candidate consistently got 3%-10% of the vote, and if (s)he ever 
<BR>
broke the double digits, this certainly would lead to a Libertarianization 
<BR>
of both wings of the Republicrat party. If you voted for Browne, you would 
<BR>
be contributing to this. I'd say that realistically I wouldn't even expect 
<BR>
him to get 1% of the vote. Nevertheless, one individual's vote for him is 
<BR>
another grain of sand on the scale. Your vote may be worth 0.0001% of the 
<BR>
future policies of the main parties.
<BR>
Voting for either of the two main parties however, has absolutely zero 
<BR>
influence. If you vote for Bush or Gore, your vote is 100% worthless
<BR>
and there's not even the slightest remotest chance it will contribute to 
<BR>
anything. If your vote were the deciding vote, the vote would be close 
<BR>
enough that it would go to congress and they would decide it.
