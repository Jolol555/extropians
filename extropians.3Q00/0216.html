<P>
I recently chanced upon a box of &quot;Whole Earth Classic Corn
<BR>
Flakes&quot; that claim,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;At Whole Earth we are proud to offer you these cornflakes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;because:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* We use organic La Plata maize that has not been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genetically engineered.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* They are crispy &amp; delicious because they are toasted in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a traditional way.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Together we're helping to support the farming methods of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the future.
<BR>
<P>Intrigued I explored further; to my surprise I discovered a
<BR>
section entitled &quot;Why GMO-free?&quot;  Finally!  A rationale!
<BR>
<P>The following is Whole Earth Foods explanation of why their
<BR>
Classic Corn Flakes are GMO-free,
<BR>
<P>-- begin quote --
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Whole Earth Foods we have always promised that our
<BR>
products are GMO-free.  For these corn flakes we use La
<BR>
Plata maize from Argentina, because it makes the best corn
<BR>
flakes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the La Plata maize for CLASSIC CORN FLAKES is grown
<BR>
on organic farms, sold with the guarantee that it has been
<BR>
grown from non-GMO seeds.  As part of the inspected and
<BR>
audited organic &quot;chain of custody&quot; it is kept separate from
<BR>
GMO maize or conventional maize.  Every lot of whole maize
<BR>
grains delivered is sampled and analysed by PCR analysis for
<BR>
the presence of GMO.  After processing a sample is also
<BR>
taken and analysed of the maize grits to reconfirm the PCR
<BR>
analysis done on the whole maize grains.  Then, as a final
<BR>
control we regularly submit the finished packed corn flakes
<BR>
for analysis, just to be sure that the procedures we follow
<BR>
have been effective in keeping GMOs out of Whole Earth
<BR>
Classic Corn Flakes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We give you the guarantee that Whole Earth will always
<BR>
maintain these rigorous controls in order to protect your
<BR>
choice to purchase GMO-free foods.
<BR>
<P>-- end quote --
<BR>
<P>There you have it, the why's and how's of anti-GM flakes.
