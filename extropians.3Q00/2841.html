<P>
An Extropian Manifesto
<BR>
<P>by Michael Lorrey
<BR>
<P>Given the Extropian Principles, and that there now exists in the media,
<BR>
government, politics, and public demonstration and acts of sabotage 
<BR>
that are opposed to and seek the end of the liberty of the individual 
<BR>
to follow the Extropian Principles, we find that the time has come 
<BR>
for the supporters of Extropy everywhere to stand up and be counted in
<BR>
their demands for the new century. Namely:
<BR>
<P>Government is Obsolete: Centralized founts of authority, controlled 
<BR>
by individuals who corrupt, and are corrupted by the centralization 
<BR>
of power, are anathema to the principles of Self Improvement and 
<BR>
Spontaneous Order. Perpetuation of government bureaucracies, the 
<BR>
confiscation of private property, the imposition of force upon 
<BR>
individuals to prevent them from engaging in victimless activities,
<BR>
restraints upon individual use of technology, and the protection and
<BR>
subsidy of priviledged corporate entities which dominate their 
<BR>
markets with the support and aid of government agents and regulations
<BR>
all restrain the liberty of the individual and the advancement of the
<BR>
human spirit, body, and mind from reaching new levels of 
<BR>
civilization, expression, and intellect.
<BR>
<P>Taxation is Slavery: The involuntary confiscation of the property and 
<BR>
productive output of the individual, to the point that currently half
<BR>
of an individuals output is now claimed by the government is slavery.
<BR>
Part time slavery under the heel of government is no less morally 
<BR>
repugnant than full time slavery under the heel of other individuals.
<BR>
We refuse to be enslaved any longer.
<BR>
<P>Civil Confiscation is Pillagry: The confiscation of the entirety of 
<BR>
one's private property, home, means of transportation, self protection,
<BR>
or production by government agencies establishes modern government 
<BR>
as no different from a feudal lord, where the serf has no inherent 
<BR>
rights and the lord has all. We no longer recognize the authority 
<BR>
of government to claim its sovereignty over our property and 
<BR>
productivity.
<BR>
<P>Technology wants to be Free: The consistent trend toward greater 
<BR>
advancements in technology indicates that opposition to its 
<BR>
advancement is not progressive, but reactive and conservative. That 
<BR>
advancement in technology consistently improve the ability of the 
<BR>
individual to live with an increasingly smaller impact upon the 
<BR>
environment demonstrates that technology is green. That advancements
<BR>
in technology also consistently improve the ability of the individual
<BR>
to contribute and make their voices heard in the community and society
<BR>
at large demonstrates that technology wants freedom for all of us. 
<BR>
Applying fascistic controls on the right of the individual to use, 
<BR>
produce, buy and sell any technology for the betterment of emself and
<BR>
es fellow human are to be opposed by any means necessary.
<BR>
<P>Private Stewardship is Superior to Public Management: History has 
<BR>
consistently shown that private landowners manage the environment on 
<BR>
their land in a superior manner to that of government controlled 
<BR>
land. The 2/3 of the land area in the western US that is still in 
<BR>
federal hands should be distributed to the people for their private 
<BR>
stewardship of it, and public land of no intrinsic worth as sites of 
<BR>
beauty and historic landmarks around the world should be distributed 
<BR>
to the people who are best able to care for them.
<BR>
<P>Corporations are NOT Persons: A corporation is merely an association 
<BR>
of laborers, and deserves no more protection for itself or its work 
<BR>
than any private professional worker. Corporations have no right to 
<BR>
buy influence in public discourse or government policymaking, or in 
<BR>
the election of individuals to public positions. Just as a government
<BR>
should have no more power to commit acts that individuals are 
<BR>
restricted from doing, so to should corporations not have the 
<BR>
ability to carry any more influence than a single individual. A 
<BR>
corporation cannot confiscate the individual rights of those that 
<BR>
associate with it, as such rights are inalienable, nor can those 
<BR>
that associate with it use their communal voice, influence, or money 
<BR>
to indimidate or force others to surrender their own rights.
<BR>
<P>The Individual is Sovereign: We re-establish that every individual 
<BR>
is endowed and evolved by its creator, Nature, with all inalienable 
<BR>
rights, and that the community, corporation, association, society, 
<BR>
state, nation, gender or ethnic group has none, as such entities are 
<BR>
fictitious memetic constructs which only exist in the human 
<BR>
imagination. Any attempt by such a group to restrain the rights of 
<BR>
the individual is a crime against humanity.
<BR>
<P>The Universe is for Everyone: Real Estate existing outside the bounds 
<BR>
of Earth that is unclaimed and uninhabited by other intelligent beings
<BR>
is free to be claimed by the first individuals to reach said real 
<BR>
estate, stake their claim, improve its condition, and defend it 
<BR>
against interlopers. No fictitious legal entity has the right to 
<BR>
restrict the ability of the individual to inhabit and settle in 
<BR>
unclaimed territory, and no individual is bound to obey any such 
<BR>
restriction.
<BR>
<P>Your Genes are Your Intellectual Property: The unique DNA and RNA 
<BR>
sequences that describes the individual in whose cells those 
<BR>
sequences are found retains original property rights over that 
<BR>
unique sequence. Corporate entities, associations, or governments, 
<BR>
having no DNA to describe their memetic structure, cannot own 
<BR>
rights to DNA or RNA sequences except as licensed to them by the 
<BR>
individuals who posess or create them. Naturally evolved DNA and RNA 
<BR>
sequences cannot be owned by any individual or group, as they are 
<BR>
the property of all of Nature's creations.
<BR>
<P>Your Property is Your Life: Since one's home, land, and means of 
<BR>
transportation, self protection, and production play such a 
<BR>
crucial role in supporting the life of the individual and eir 
<BR>
dependents, Property Crimes committed against individuals by other
<BR>
individuals or groups, whether for personal gain, political 
<BR>
expression, or public policy are crimes against life, and are to 
<BR>
be defended against as capital crimes are.
<BR>
<P>You are Responsible for Yourself: Placing demands upon the property 
<BR>
and resources of others is theft and slavery. Individual Sovereignty
<BR>
mandates Individual Responsbility. The consenting Individual is 
<BR>
responsible for the security, maintenance, protection, and impact 
<BR>
upon others of their own property, productivity, progeny, and person. 
<BR>
<P>Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law: Any idea, action, 
<BR>
expression, or activity by consenting adults which does not 
<BR>
alienate the rights of other individuals cannot be restrained by 
<BR>
any other individual or group.
<BR>

<P>Mike Lorrey
<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
