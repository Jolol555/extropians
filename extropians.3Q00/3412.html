I was very saddened to learn of the slanderous and totally unfounded attacks against Max and Keith.  But, when people stand up to be counted it can bring forth the ire of the immature, ignorant and intolerant.  I hope both Max and Keith have not allowed the incident to ruffle their feathers too much.  
<BR>
<P>I have to admit messing with a group as cybersavvy as the extropians is simply stupid!!  This person may sooner than later regret having messed with such a formidable group.  May God have mercy on his/her soul because Greg Burch sure won't! ;)
<BR>
<P>I have heard Max is no stranger to threats and false allegations; which is very sad.  And Keith is a brave man to confront the Scientologists.  I read a book the &quot;church&quot; tried to ban which absolutely horrified me.  Some people seem to be helped by their methods but others are deeply hurt. 
<BR>
<P>One thing we could do is make people register in a more detailed and verifiable way before they could post.  This would make it harder for &quot;hit and run&quot; slander posts to be carried out.  I realize this could take some of the spontaneity out of the list so perhaps it is not a good idea.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,

<P>&quot;Death to all the enemies of King Max!&quot;
