<EM>&gt;....If I seek transcendance through intelligence enhancement, uploading,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or something &gt;else, can't I expect to lose this illusion I call my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;identity?
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks Scott!
<BR>
<P>When I was asking why AI/SI would/could 'want to want' anything... Why and
<BR>
how should it gain Consciousness? Is being conscious a prerequisite of
<BR>
wanting? That's THE question!
<BR>
<P>Uploading my memory bank into a machine: What would be the difference
<BR>
between leaning/reading/ thinking everything in one second or in one
<BR>
thousand years? Zip! Uploading would essentially mean the end of the
<BR>
illusion of time. Life without that illusion equals absolute eteranl
<BR>
insanity. Also, I'd really miss my body. Identity itself may be a dynamic
<BR>
illusion and therefore, time dependent - not to mention reality.
<BR>
<P>What enhancements are available to me now? To be here and not exist at the
<BR>
same time, to be conscious and not want anything, sort of a Zen state of
<BR>
observation, appeals to me but I keep getting in the way.
<BR>
<P>Cryogenics? I do question the finality of death. Not sure I believe in it.
<BR>
Now, if you can get me a brand new body........
