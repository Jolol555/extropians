<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding making &quot;good&quot; games.  It is an interersting question as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to what seduces people into games -- currently the paradigm would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem to suggest good graphics is a necessity -- in contrast the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1970's games had *no* graphics -- you had to map the game entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your head.  I wonder if there are two types of people -- those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who can create mental images reflecting a reality and those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; require the images to be painted for them who would be enrolled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into very different game presentations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah- readers vs mouth breathers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Quite. And no Doug, you are not being cynical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As a kid, I loved military aircraft, ships, and battles. Problem was, mom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; refused to buy me any of those COOL GI Joe toys or other military models,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so being the only kid on the block who was reading whole books at age 4, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would take bits of wood (we were not poor) and plastic, and make symbolic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons, vehicles, ships and soldiers, and stage my little battles in the dirtpile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behind the shed. Is it any wonder they other kids laughed at my little piles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sticks when they asked what I was doing and I said I was running a war???
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is an idea floating around (very strong in the general community too I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think) that games need flashy graphics to be successful these days. Check
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out Utopia, or any of the other net-based, html based games. No graphics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tens of thousands of players. Some of them are no brain surgeons. There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indeed a market for something other than eye-candy.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to agree. It seems to be, to me at least, a result of each
<BR>
generation being brought up more by TV than by their parents. When I
<BR>
first started playing Wolfenstein, I think in 1991 or so, I had not
<BR>
played any video game more complex than atari games (4-6 years
<BR>
previously), and the game literally game me headaches, I think because
<BR>
the 3d graphics conflicted with my minds own generation of playspace. It
<BR>
took quite a while before I could adjust so that I only had a slight
<BR>
'car sick head' level of pain after several hours play.
