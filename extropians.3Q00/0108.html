<P>I agree completely with Greg. Great point about how the two sides are 
<BR>
talking past one another. As someone who teaches college students part 
<BR>
time, I can tell you from personal experience that almost *no one* is 
<BR>
taught basic financial planning in school. As part of my critical thinking 
<BR>
class, I cover critical thinking about investing and personal finance. I 
<BR>
always ask how many of the students have covered any of this before. 
<BR>
Usually not one person raises their hand. They seem to find that particular 
<BR>
topic the most engaging one of all. I'm always stunned to find that 
<BR>
financial planning, basic logic, and evolutionary theory, are almost never 
<BR>
taught in schools, at least based on the many hundreds of students I have 
<BR>
surveyed.
<BR>
<P>I doubt that a solution can easily be implemented within the existing state 
<BR>
monopoly education system. It simply is not set up for innovation or for 
<BR>
meeting people's real needs. If I had to pick a #1 social policy priority 
<BR>
it would be introducing competition into the schools, by privatizing them. 
<BR>
To relieve concerns about funding, I would not object to either tax-funded 
<BR>
vouchers and/or tax credits. (I would prefer tax credits, though to get 
<BR>
this approach accepted, vouchers might be needed for the poorer people who 
<BR>
pay little or no taxes.)
<BR>
<P>Competition in education would also help move the educational system from 
<BR>
its current industrial style, where students learn facts and procedures, 
<BR>
towards an information-age style where students learn to solve problems 
<BR>
through creative and critical thinking.
<BR>
<P>A final note: I'm a little bothered by Damien's sweeping generalization 
<BR>
about American's (or rather Extropian American's) &quot;knee-jerk&quot; (or similar 
<BR>
wording) reaction to suggestions of state control and spending programs. 
<BR>
Damien, I moved here from England and have experienced first hand 
<BR>
socialized medicine. I prefer market-based medicine from experience as well 
<BR>
as from theory. And America does not really have free market medicine--the 
<BR>
number of regulations, interventions, and restrictions makes this far from 
<BR>
a free market, though I would never want to give up what we have for a more 
<BR>
statist system. The U.S. medical system certainly could be improved. But it 
<BR>
needs *more* market processes, not fewer.
<BR>
<P>Onward!
