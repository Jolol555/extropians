<EM>&gt; I just read this article by Robert X. Cringley:

<EM>&gt; Original Article: <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html</A>

[SNIP]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; But I have my own theory about Carnivore. From a network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture standpoint, the best location for Carnivore is right after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ISP's router. This puts Carnivore in the path of every packet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entering or leaving the ISP. It's also a major reason why ISPs might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not want to install Carnivore boxes -- it's the network's point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatest vulnerability. In this position, Carnivore can act as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listening and recording device, OR IT CAN ACT AS A SWITCH. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we ever hear a proposal from the FBI in which it plans to install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Carnivores at all 6000 ISPs in the U.S., we'll be giving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government the power to do something it can't do right now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                    Shut the Internet down.

<P>GOOD!
<BR>
<P>The Emergency Internet Shutdown System should have been implemented a
<BR>
long time ago.  You don't even need AI for the problems to exist,
<BR>
although (dumber-than-human, but malicious) AI is a problem too. 
<BR>
Sufficiently sophisticated viruses, alife... and the worst problem will
<BR>
be the one we haven't even thought of yet.
<BR>
<P>What is the FBI going to do, shut the Internet down because it's free
<BR>
and therefore evil?  Industry would scream their heads off.  Besides, if
<BR>
the government is evil, they can just take a bunch of tanks and blow up
<BR>
Sprint headquarters.  The Emergency Internet Shutdown System seems
<BR>
unlikely to be used except in a real, genuine emergency.
<BR>
<P>Besides, just the fact that there's a Big Red Switch out there will lead
<BR>
people and corporations to plan ahead for Internet problems.  I
<BR>
reeeaally don't think it would be a good idea for society to reach the
<BR>
point where an Internet shutdown could cause havoc on the same order as
<BR>
the Y2K problem.  As long as the Big Red Switch exists, and everyone
<BR>
knows about it, people will be just a little more reluctant to build
<BR>
Internet-dependent elevators and power plants.  'Cause you know that one
<BR>
of these days there's gonna be a Big Crash.
