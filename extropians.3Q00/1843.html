Subject: GAMES: Historical truths [was Re: The games are all crap...]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Regarding making &quot;good&quot; games.  It is an interersting question as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to what seduces people into games -- currently the paradigm would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem to suggest good graphics is a necessity -- in contrast the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1970's games had *no* graphics -- you had to map the game entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in your head.  I wonder if there are two types of people -- those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who can create mental images reflecting a reality and those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;require the images to be painted for them who would be enrolled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into very different game presentations.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Hi Robert,
<BR>
<P>There are more than two types I am sure! Building addiction into games
<BR>
depends on things such as age group as well as the rest, since the bits of
<BR>
games that 8 yr olds like best, adults like least &amp;c. Things like ease to
<BR>
set up, repeatability, and getting the skill to luck ration right are
<BR>
crucial.
<BR>
<P>As you say, graphics aren't the whole story, and are sometimes a substitute
<BR>
for game play. If only the graphics were important, you might as well watch
<BR>
a film.
<BR>
<P>Best
