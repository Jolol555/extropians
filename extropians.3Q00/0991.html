Eliezer wrote, quoting remote viewer Joe McMoneagle:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The target was later independently judged by a person who was not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; participant to the experiment, producing a significant effect size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of 0.710 +/- 0.289 (p=0.007).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How on Earth do they judge the significant effect size without a control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; group?  Did they try having the judge check the guy's drawings against a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; randomly selected photograph as well as the target?  Not as far as I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell.  If so, the whole experiment is entirely meaningless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Normally these experiments involve choosing a target randomly from a
<BR>
predefined set.  The judges are then given the notes and drawings from
<BR>
the viewer, plus all the possible targets, and judge which target most
<BR>
closely matches the viewer's reports.  (I suppose there is danger here
<BR>
that the judges' psychic powers may be measured rather than the viewer's.)
<BR>
<P>On this basis you don't need a control, because the expectation is simply
<BR>
a chance result.  Standard statistical techniques will tell you if the
<BR>
result is statistically significant.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure what Moneagle means by his statistical claims above; a single
<BR>
test can't produce statistical results, so presumably he is referring to
<BR>
a series of tests which included the example picture.  &quot;Effect size&quot; is a
<BR>
measure beloved by experimenters who can't get statistically significant
<BR>
results, but it's not clear to me what he means by giving a p=0.007 in
<BR>
conjunction with effect size.  Is he saying that his results were better
<BR>
than chance, at the 0.7% level?  That would be interesting, although of
<BR>
course you'd have to look at the experimental design in detail to judge
<BR>
how meaningful it is.  I suspect he is making a weaker claim, though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And the other thing to remember is that sometimes psychic researchers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially the ones writing books, will outright lie!  If you read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something and think &quot;There's no way this could be faked,&quot; sometimes it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just never happened.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, it is always suspicious when you see results like this presented
<BR>
on a web site which is selling remote viewing books and services.
<BR>
It is better to stick to the academic literature.
