<P>
&quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; says:
<BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; programmers and supporters, some might say.  Some statistics have it runnin
</EM><BR>
g
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; half the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Except that linux is NOT free. It typically is sold on CD-ROM for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $40-80, which is little different from other operating systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I downloaded RedHat linux for free from the FTP site.  I similarly
<BR>
downloaded the NetBSD Unix-like OS.  This is totally legal and
<BR>
encouraged.  RedHat tells you how to do it on their website.  I
<BR>
believe you can also take the downloaded software, burn it on a CD,
<BR>
and in fact sell it, all totally legally.
<BR>
<P>The only thing that buying the actual CD from RedHat gets you is,
<BR>
according to the website:
<BR>
<P>Installation support
<BR>
<P>Priority Online Access for software updates
<BR>
<P>Printed manuals and Documentation CD
<BR>
<P>A large collection of some of the most popular Linux applications on
<BR>
CD-ROM
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  Can I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduce a Redhat CD-ROM and sell them for a buck if I want to? No, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, actually, as long as it's all GPL software, under the terms of the
<BR>
GPL, you can do so totally legally.  (There may be some non-GPL
<BR>
software in there, I guess, that you'd have to leave out, though the
<BR>
core OS is all GPL.)  You can make all the copies of the GPL'ed code
<BR>
you want and distribute them for any price you choose.  That's kind of
<BR>
the point of the GPL.
<BR>
<P>Here's the license:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html</A>
<BR>
<P>A key part is:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rights. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;distribute and/or modify the software.  
<BR>
<P>You see the point?  The GPL makes it impossible to forbid someone from
<BR>
redistributing your code.  RedHat *cannot* forbid you from
<BR>
redistributing as many copies as you like at whatever price you choose
<BR>
of any free software they sell.
<BR>
<P>Now, I don't know that this is true, but there may be some non-free
<BR>
software bundled with the free software on the disk.  Presumably these
<BR>
are not available on the FTP site.  In that case, you would have to
<BR>
omit those particular programs from the copy you make.  But other
<BR>
fully functional GNU/Linux distros include only free software,
<BR>
e.g. Debian, (as does the RedHat FTP version, I assume).  And you
<BR>
could totally legally burn your own copy and sell Debian CD's for
<BR>
whatever price you choose.
<BR>
<P>I understand that there are people in the business of selling
<BR>
copies of the RedHat distro for less than RedHat charges.  RedHat is
<BR>
not trying to drive them out of business.  They're not in it for the
<BR>
license fees.  That's just now how a free software business works.  
<BR>
<P>This is in fact the whole point of the GPL: to encourage people to
<BR>
promiscuously share software, as long as they don't try to gain
<BR>
control over it and limit others from doing so.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
James
