<P><EM>&gt; There is a cluster of values common to most (not all) members of the religious right wing in this country.  They are predominately antiabortion, pro-death penalty, pro-gun, anti-womens' and minority parity and pro-judeo-christian-influenced government (against church/state separation).  There are exceptions, but their very status as exceptions highlights the fact that this cluster of values is more often than not found together.

<P>To add to the list: anti-intellectual, anti-science, anti-evolution,
<BR>
anti-les-bi-gay-trans, anti-fiddling with &quot;God's Law&quot; generally and
<BR>
doing whatever makes them the least queasy specifically.  Some of the
<BR>
scarier ones think a more or less theocracy is a fine idea.  
<BR>
<P>You know, I temper my love of tech with a deep love of humanity and
<BR>
desire to see the race advance and to include everyone in the benefits
<BR>
that are so obvious.  But I don't know how to include or reach some of
<BR>
the people out there.  How do you reach someone who doesn't want to be
<BR>
reached and is bent on your destruction (to the extent they know about
<BR>
you and can get away with it).  How do you reach the 60+% in the US
<BR>
whose primary core beliefs revolve around utter fairy tales?  I run into
<BR>
statistics such as that nearly 50% of college grads in the US never read
<BR>
a single book after graduation.  Totally incomprehensible to me.  Nearly
<BR>
a different species.  Or claims that a huge portion of the population
<BR>
never achieves the state of mental development known as formal
<BR>
operations.  How can such people be reached with the truth of what is
<BR>
now much less what is coming?  How can these people be trusted to vote
<BR>
on technologies they cannot begin to comprehend or even conceive of? 
<BR>
How can we reach them and gather their vote instead of leaving it to the
<BR>
Creation Coalition or worse?  
<BR>
<P>And, if they can't be reached, how do we proceed in such a way that they
<BR>
don't stop us and most likely doom the species in the process?
