<P>
<EM>&gt; In a discussion in another forum, the question of whether computers have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;found&quot; valid mathematical proofs has come up.  Being mathematically stunted, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought I'd do a hand-off of the question to this forum, since someone able 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to comment intelligently on the question probably inhabits this forum.  Any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leads or help?
</EM><BR>
<P>The scare quotes seem appropriate, because it really depends on what you
<BR>
mean by &quot;found&quot;.  After all, humans programmed systems to search for
<BR>
proofs, and generally directed them in what to look for, so I'd be more
<BR>
inclined to say that human mathematicians found the proofs with the aid
<BR>
of a computer (and which they would not have found without such aid).
<BR>
The classic case is the four-color threorem: a computer was used to
<BR>
enumerate and evaluate a large collection of maps, and then prove by
<BR>
time-consuming brute force that a specific subset of the ones generated
<BR>
exhausted all relevant possibilities.  A human could not have done this
<BR>
within a lifetime.
<BR>
<P>Similar programs have also &quot;found&quot; interesting theorems and their
<BR>
proofs, given sufficient guidance from human programmers as to what
<BR>
is &quot;interesting&quot;, without specifically being told what to look for. 
<BR>
