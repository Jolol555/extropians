Well I would have to say that yes I am becoming a bit cynical. It comes
<BR>
from a difference in viewpoints between the &quot;people in general are going
<BR>
to take the path of least resistance&quot; school of thought and the &quot;people
<BR>
are basically good, and in general will 'do their part' for the greater
<BR>
good&quot; school of thought espoused by various philosophies: communism,
<BR>
socialism, and in general anyone rationalizing why people shouldn't be
<BR>
forced to be 100% responsible for their lives. I am falling more and more
<BR>
into the first viewpoint.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From that viewpoint, I don't know if talking about these issues is going
</EM><BR>
to have much of an effect. It's kind of like those war on drugs commercials-
<BR>
you can tell people how bad (supposedly) drugs are for them, educate them
<BR>
all you want. The effect? People are still going to do it. And I think of
<BR>
things like welfare and medicaid like those drugs- as long as they exist
<BR>
no amount of education is going to help; the only people really buying into
<BR>
the education/ads are those at the other end of the Bell curve who are
<BR>
already believers in self-responsibility.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The problem here, which I haven't seen mentioned is that most of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  latter things are expected to be taught to people by their families
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  as they grow up. The fact that we have to now consider moving them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  into schooling shows just how bad our &quot;home education&quot; system has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  gotten in many cases. If you do try to move many of these subjects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  into schools you are going to have a real debate on your hands as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &quot;what is the best diet?&quot;, &quot;what are the best economic theories?&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &quot;what is the best philosophy?&quot;.. you see where I am going. There would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  be a huge flamewar in every school district. If the schools were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  private though, it might work since each school could specialize in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  a certain way of looking at the world and teach/brainwash that to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  their students. Of course this viewpoint would be exactly the same as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the parents who are paying the fees- essentially getting the same effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I think as if these subjects had simply been taught at home as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  are now. Am I cynical?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I think the most important underlying point is: just because a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  people happen to live in the USA doesn't mean they are well suited to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  it. As has been noted, some people are in fact not even able to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  with it. And some people like many on this list find it too restricting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  The education system is not going to totally fix this even if you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  able to agree on (good luck) a social contract curriculum. It's a deeper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  problem I think- a one size fits all government applied to a bell curve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  of people and lifestyles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree with you Brian, that a person's family should teach them the basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms of the social contract of the society in which a person will live.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many things have happened that have made this ineffective in the US in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current age.  First, there ARE a lot of immigrants here, which means that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much of the &quot;social education&quot; people got in childhood doesn't &quot;fit&quot; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society they've come to live in.  Second, people are much more mobile now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than they were 100 or even 50 years ago, and the IMPLICIT social contract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that comes with living all of one's life among the same people just doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work for a society of people that grows up in one (or more) communities, goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to college in another, and works in three or four more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also agree that making education in the &quot;basic deal&quot; of our society part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a uniform public school curriculum isn't the ideal and certainly not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; final answer; and also that it would ignite a lot of public debate.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's sort of the idea behind what I was lamenting: We NEED to talk more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the fact that we expect people to take care of themselves as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; default assumption.  The fact that so few people actually annunciate this as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a basic principle is symptomatic of a kind of &quot;civic blindness&quot; that won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get better by ignoring it (which I don't think you were advocating)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; .
