<P>
Mike,
<BR>
<P>This &quot;poll&quot; is bogus.  It is deliberately misleading.  It makes more claims
<BR>
than it asks questions!
<BR>
<P>It never asked if people would vote for the constitution.  It asked if
<BR>
people would vote for the constitution AND to repeal all of the
<BR>
&quot;unauthorized&quot; programs passed by congress including funding for teachers,
<BR>
funding for symphonies, funding for the arts, and any forms of gun-control.
<BR>
They even seem to imply that school prayer is not really unconstitutional,
<BR>
and politicians just claim it is, so voting for the constitution wouldn't
<BR>
necessarily prevent school prayer.
<BR>
<P>Only by agreeing to reverse all these &quot;unauthorized&quot; laws could a person
<BR>
vote &quot;for&quot; the constitution.
<BR>
<P>This was not a &quot;poll&quot; in the sense that it did not try to seek out public
<BR>
opinion.  It was obviously written to lead a person to a specific point and
<BR>
trap them into a bad position.
<BR>
<P>I would vote FOR the constitution today.
<BR>
I would vote AGAINST repealing all of the laws they list.
<BR>
I could not vote on the question in the poll, because my position was not
<BR>
given as one of the possible answers!
<BR>
<P>(But what do you expect from &quot;Portrait of America,&quot;
<BR>
