When given the opportunity, I mention that I'm a transhumanist/extropian and 
<BR>
of course everyone wants an explanation.  Everyone in my household shares my 
<BR>
beliefs.  However most people are too negative or too involved in their day 
<BR>
to day existences to care about such non-mainstream beliefs.  I don't have 
<BR>
enough contact with people to determine whether or not I've &quot;influenced&quot; any 
<BR>
to a large extent but I think I was able to get a few to at least not give 
<BR>
themselves death sentences.  :)
