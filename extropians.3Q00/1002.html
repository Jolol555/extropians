<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I understand it, you don't have to charge money to violate copyright,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; just damage the author's ability to make money from their work by it's use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This isn't true. You have to be actively charging money for providing others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the specific enjoyment of its use and NOT paying Metallica or its record
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; company a royalty. Playing Metallica in your backyard for a cookout is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; violation of copyright, even though your use of their CD in providing free music
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to other people who might not own their CD.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, it's not quite that simple (laws never are, and IP laws are much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worse).  &quot;Public performance&quot; can be an infringement, and charging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money or not is not the deciding factor.  A court decides on a case-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by-case basis.  Playing an album at your party is probably okay, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you charged for entrance.  But waiters singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; customers is not--that has been ruled an infringement of the copyright
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to that song owned by the estate of the Smith sisters, who zealously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pursue such infringements of the copyright--no doubt to encourage the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production of more creative work by their dead ancestors.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but waiters are engaging in a dinnerlong performance for compensation: their
<BR>
tips.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you think &quot;I'm not making money&quot; is an excuse, put up a fan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; website for a popular movie or TV show and see what happens.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where such websites get nailed is the unauthorized use of trademarks, logos,
<BR>
etc. which do not depend upon money changing hands to be protectable..
