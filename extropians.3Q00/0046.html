<EM>&gt; &gt; This appeared in the current issue of Australian Aviation Magazine
</EM><BR>
(June 2000?)...../with an addition for online entertainment
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RULES OF THE AIR/Rules of life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1. Every takeoff is optional. Every landing is mandatory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /Every birth is optional. Every death is mandatory.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2. If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger. If you pull
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the stick back, they get smaller. That is, unless you keep pulling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the stick all the way back, then they get bigger again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /If you push the greaseberger forward, your death get bigger. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/If you pull the greaseburger back, it gets smaller.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 3. Flying isn't dangerous. Crashing is what's dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /Being born isn't dangerous. Dieing is what's dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 4. It's always better to be down here wishing you were up there than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; up there wishing you were down here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /It's always better to be down at the hospital entrance wishing you
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/you were inside than inside wishing you were at the entrance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 5. The ONLY time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /The ONLY time you have too much food is when you're having a 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/heart attack.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 6. The propeller is just a big fan in front of the plane used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; keep the pilot cool. When it stops, you can actually watch the pilot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; start sweating.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /The heart is just a big pump in the front of the chest. When it
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/stops you can actually watch the body start sweating.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 7. When in doubt, hold on to your altitude. No one has ever collided
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the sky.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /When in doubt, hold your breath. No one has ever suffocated
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/while having a lung full of air.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 8. A 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. A 'great'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; landing is one after which they can use the plane again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /A 'good' life is one you are still walking in.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/A 'great' life is one others want to walk in.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 9. Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make all of them yourself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;    /Don't drive into brick walls.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 10. You know you've landed with the wheels up if it takes full power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to taxi to the ramp.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /You know you're still alive if you can still taxi to the ramp.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 11. The probability of survival is inversely proportional to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; angle of arrival. Large angle of arrival, small probability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; survival and vice versa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /The probability of survival is inversely propertional to the
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/amount of couch time. Large amounts of couch time, small 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/probability of survival and visa versa.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 12. Never let an aircraft take you somewhere your brain didn't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to five minutes earlier.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Never let a car take you somehwere your brain didn't get to 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/five seconds earlier.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 13. Stay out of clouds. The silver lining everyone keeps talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; about might be another airplane going in the opposite direction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Reliable sources also report that mountains have been known to hide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out in clouds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Keep your mind out of clouds....
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 14. Always try to keep the number of landings you make equal to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; number of take offs you've made.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Always try to keep the numbers of sleeps you make equal to the 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/number of wake ups you've made.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 15. There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately no one knows what they are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /There are three simple rules for having a smooth life. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/Unfortunaely no one knows what these are either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 16. You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experience. The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; empty the bag of luck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 17. Helicopters can't fly; they're just so ugly the earth repels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Stomachs can't stay above the belt; they're just so ugly the
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/earth repels them.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 18. If all you can see out of the window is ground that's going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; round and round and all you can hear is commotion coming from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; passenger compartment, things are not at all as they should be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Ditto for buses.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 19. In the ongoing battle between objects made of aluminum going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hundreds of miles per hour and the ground going zero miles per hour,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the ground has yet to lose.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Except for a heavily armoured personel carrier.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 20. Good judgment comes from experience. Unfortunately, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experience usually comes from bad judgment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 21. It's always a good idea to keep the pointy end going forward as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; much as possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /If your nose is buried in the ground, that's a bad sign.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 22. Keep looking around. There's always something you've missed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Like a stop sign.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 23. Remember, gravity is not just a good idea. It's the law. And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's not subject to repeal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /Remember, inertia...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 24. The three most useless things to a pilot are the altitude above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you, runway behind you, and a tenth of a second ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     /The three most useless things to a person are the earth above 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/you, the life behind you, and a tenth of a eulogy ago.
<BR>
<P>With apologies to pilots everywhere.
