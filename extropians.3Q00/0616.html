<P><EM>&gt; What I found difficult to bear about marriage, and why I bailed even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  my husband was a wonderful person, was the way in which it made life...how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  can I say this?...predictable? stable? These are things that many people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  WANT in their lives, but I hated the feeling that I couldn't decide on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  spur of the moment to take off for a weekend in Mexico, and especially I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  hated never being alone.  I seem to have a requirement for a certain 
</EM><BR>
minimum
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  amount of solitude, but when I tried to go off by myself my husband would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  think I was angry with him--which I soon would be when he kept pressing me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to be with him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  A lot of this is personal to me, and though it may have something to do 
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  the cultural position of women relative to men, it may have more to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  my own greater than usual need for solitude and self-direction.  When I 
</EM><BR>
left
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  my husband, I resolved never to inflict myself on another man ever again,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and I've pretty much held to that resolution. Sometimes, though, I wish it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  didn't have to be so.
</EM><BR>
<P>During some periods of time I travel a lot with my work, and people ask how 
<BR>
that effects my marriage.  I always get a laugh by responding that every 
<BR>
relationship has a set number of good days, and you shouldn't use them all up 
<BR>
at one time.  Seriously, &quot;negotiating&quot; solitary time is one of the key 
<BR>
aspects of making a long term relationship &quot;work,&quot; in my experience. 
<BR>
<P>My wife is a visual artist and she obviously works by herself at that.  The 
<BR>
writing part of my work and avocations is also a solitary pursuit.  Figuring 
<BR>
out when the other person needs solitary time, and when he or she needs to 
<BR>
spend time together is very important.  We've found that sometimes this can 
<BR>
work itself out spontaneously, but most of the time we have to sit down and 
<BR>
spend some time &quot;synching up&quot; our plans and schedules and figuring out what 
<BR>
things we're going to do together and what times we'll be working or playing 
<BR>
alone or with others.  Investing time in signaling these needs is pretty 
<BR>
important.
