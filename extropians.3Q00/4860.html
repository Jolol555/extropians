<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure that David's transparency would necessarily fix the IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem, anyway.  In a truly transparent world, shouldn't I be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; look over David's shoulder as he types up his latest novel?  Shouldn't I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have access to it in the files on his computer?  And if I buy the book,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn't my friends be able to read it at the same time that I do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; via my wearable webcam?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure.  But to get there you need to drastically rewire some fundamental
<BR>
assumptions of human psychology, sociology and economics.  You can't get
<BR>
there and be comfortable as long as we are hyper-competitive and largely
<BR>
scarcity based in our thinking and economics.  You can't get there as
<BR>
long as people believe they have the right to interfere in your life and
<BR>
actions just because they disagree with you even though your actions are
<BR>
not depriving anyone else of their own freedom and well-being. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think that kind of total transparency is likely. People won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; voluntarily allow cameras into their homes that they can't turn off, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; allow everyone to access their hard drives across the Internet. I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really imagine that the technology necessary to achieve total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transparency without consent will arrive soon enough to make a difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the IP issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You assume that people will be asked for their permission and that other
<BR>
people and technologies will respect that permission or that people will
<BR>
develop sufficient defenses.  The first two are sociological and up to
<BR>
us.  The last is technological.  The technology is pretty much here
<BR>
today to watch you and spy on you every moment of the day without you
<BR>
being able to stop it unless you are pretty damn bright and persistent. 
<BR>
The good news is that the technology is not quite so advanced or cheap
<BR>
yet that it can be so easily employed on just everybody all the time. 
<BR>
But we are getting there quite rapidly.  Rather than stop the technology
<BR>
or in addition to building techno-shields, let's also give a fair amount
<BR>
of thought to how humanity has to change to live with this level of
<BR>
&quot;transparency&quot; and see if some of those changes are doable.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; You're probably right about the relative time frames.  These IP issues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have come to the fore more abruptly than most people anticipated a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My understanding of Brin's ideas was that transparency would in fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invade the home.  He did suggest that there might be specific areas where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people would still have privacy, but he wanted to be able to make sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they were not commiting information crimes.  This was also the motivation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to crack down on crypto.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>In my considered opinion, the idea of &quot;information crimes&quot; in most of
<BR>
its forms is one of the first things that needs considerable rethinking
<BR>
at this time.  I don't believe there is any such valid thing as
<BR>
&quot;intellectual property&quot; so entire categories of &quot;information crime&quot;
<BR>
disappear almost immediately.  What is really happening is that the
<BR>
barriers between public and private and between individuals are cracking
<BR>
as the technology broadens the reach of conscious awareness.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; David Brin himself claims that he is interested in transparency as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; protection against abuse by the powerful. I don't think it's the right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; solution to that problem, but it seems like a more plausible motivation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It was my interpretation, based on some email correspondence and reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an early draft of his book.  He mentioned concern about his own livelihood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the draft; I don't recall whether it made it into the final version.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Crypto doesn't seem to be a tool for the powerful, but he spends a lot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of time arguing against it.  And as you say, there is a poor fit between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ostensible problem and the proposed solution, which suggests to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an ulterior motive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Until we are in an abundance mode and have all mostly adapted
<BR>
non-interference with one another and actually believe that are own
<BR>
fullest growth is dependent on the fullest growth of all, there is
<BR>
plenty of good reason to keep what secrets you can.  There are people
<BR>
out there who will not only object to your opinions but who will happily
<BR>
initiate force to stop and even destroy you.  We are not in paradise
<BR>
yet.  Perhaps paradise will never be until we are vastly different
<BR>
creatures than we are today.
