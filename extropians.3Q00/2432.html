<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From gun shows and dealers in states, such as my own (Florida)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with more relaxed laws; they are bought in such places and moved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to venues with more restrictive laws to make black market money. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's the economics of supply and demand.  I. for one, would prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criminals, the unbalanced and the irresponsible to have to buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their illegal guns from outside of the country, not just out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;state (in some states); anything that makes it harder for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people to get their hands on a tool for committing easy and rapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long range mass murder has to be a GOOD THING.
</EM><BR>
<P>Really! Can you provide a citing for this? Thought not.....
<BR>
<P>Actually you got your wish, I've seen Chi-com AK47's, the full auto
<BR>
version for sale here on the black market, still in the original
<BR>
chinese boxes....
<BR>
<P>But that's not where they get the vast majority, try again.....
