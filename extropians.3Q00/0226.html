<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you agree that these instincts are built into their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; brains by DNA?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's an f'r instance:
<BR>
<P>&lt; Even in matters of behavior, the program can be astonishingly precise. A
<BR>
favorite laboratory animal, the microscopic roundworm known as C. elegans,
<BR>
can be found in soils around the world, peacefully eating bacteria. Some C.
<BR>
elegans colonies are very social and all dine together. In others, solitary
<BR>
feeding is the rule. Biologists at the University of California in San
<BR>
Francisco recently discovered that both social and solitary feeding in the
<BR>
worm are controlled by the same gene. In the 215th word of the gene, the
<BR>
solitary feeders have the letters G-T-T, the social feeders T-T-T. Just as
<BR>
in computer programs, a single letter can make all the difference. &gt;
<BR>

<BR>
<P>but it's a cool example)
