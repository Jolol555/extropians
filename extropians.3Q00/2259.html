<EM>&gt; &gt; With regard to the Bible, it was suggested to me by a Russian scientist

<EM>&gt; &gt; at one point, that the biblical longevities could be due to a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;translation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; error.  If ages were kept in &quot;months&quot; rather than &quot;years&quot;, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; numbers work out about right....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sounds about right except for the fairly linear decay in lifespans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the beginning to Moses, who was said to have lived 120 years.

<EM>&gt;There were only a few early lucky ones that made it into the 900s.

And note, as I suggested, that this period - of the supposed references for 
<BR>
the great epics and myths - roughly coincides with the expansion of 
<BR>
Cro-Magnon man into the northern areas of Europe and Asia and the first 
<BR>
large cities, suggesting that temporarily at least the pioneers had broken 
<BR>
free of the deadly cycle of expansion-then-collapse caused by the endemic 
<BR>
tropical diseases.  The exponential increase in generally available 
<BR>
knowledge that accompanied the larger population concentrations would have 
<BR>
provided an equally exponential advantage to long-lived individuals, 
<BR>
especially as written language was still in the future.
