<P><EM>&gt; The question is whether this affects or not the aging process

<EM>&gt; using ionizing radiation, UV, chemical mutagens, etc. in mice and flies

<EM>&gt; showed that the mutations caused by these agents are not a part of the

</EM><BR>
<P>It would be interesting to go back and look at these in detail.
<BR>
We know now that high doses of radiation are going to cause extensive
<BR>
apoptosis due to the number of double strand breaks they cause.
<BR>
That would presumably not be the same as &quot;aging&quot;.  You also
<BR>
need to carefully differentiate between the mouse and fly studies
<BR>
because the adult flies are all post-mitotic tissue.  It is
<BR>
also questionable whether you could use mice, because many lab mice
<BR>
die from cancer (not &quot;aging&quot;), and all the mutagens are going to
<BR>
do is increase the cancer rate.
<BR>
<P>What would be interesting is to study the effects of long-term low-dose
<BR>
exposure to mutagens/radiation.  Also interesting would be using
<BR>
mutagens/radiation to attempt to induce aging in non-aging organisms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I asked this in a previous post, I ask it again, why then do clones made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from young cells (taken from foetus, not young adults) show the exact same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems? Until you can answer me this I will not be convinced.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you have studies that cite the clone failure rate and developmental
<BR>
abnormalities are the same with foetal cells *and* adults?
<BR>
<P>I would not have expected that people would have done these studies yet,
<BR>
certainly not in replicated work that you can make strong claims about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I never liked Kirkwood's disposable soma theory and this reminds me of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's my problem: if you overexpress telomerase in mitotic cells they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overcome aging without any noticeable loss of resources. So, even assuming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the telomeres as an anti-cancer mechanisms, cells can very cheaply overcome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; senescence, contradicting Kirkwood's theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>It sounds like you are mixing apples and oranges.  Mitotic cells in
<BR>
my mind cannot be classed as &quot;soma&quot;.  My brain cells typically don't
<BR>
divide and that is the &quot;soma&quot; that when disposed of causes the problems.
<BR>
While the &quot;perfect&quot; cells can overcome senescence, cells that have
<BR>
fatal mutations in essential genes (from mutagens, cosmic rays or
<BR>
simply even error in copying from DNA polymersase) certainly cannot.
<BR>
The thing that always gets left out of cell scenescence studies is
<BR>
the discussion of what fraction of cells you &quot;lose&quot; because they have
<BR>
accumulated fatal mutations.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Many species showing vegetative reproduction are other examples refuting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these theories.
</EM><BR>
In the long run even the bodies of Sequoia trees are disposable!
<BR>
Certainly in bacteria or endlessly self-cloning plants there is
<BR>
no &quot;soma&quot; to dispose of.  The entire organism is &quot;reproductive&quot;.
<BR>
There *is* aging however in that some fraction of those reproductive
<BR>
cells are likely to be sterile.  Guarante's work in budding yeast
<BR>
shows that cellular aging does occur and it is caused by what is
<BR>
effectively DNA damage.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In addition, studies done in biotechnology show that cells can overexpress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large amounts of trangenic genes without any noticeable deleterious effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (unless a toxic product is involved, of course).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure that I see how this applies.  You have machines that are
<BR>
designed to produce proteins.  They do that.  However there is a
<BR>
great deal of work that shows these cells have limits and you can
<BR>
overengineer them to an extent that they cease functioning.  If
<BR>
you want to harvest a nonsecretable protein, you don't much care
<BR>
whether the cell is sterile, you simply care what its yield was.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I must say that although your ideas are logical I'm not convinced. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance, wouldn't it be cheaper to just repair everything instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creating and powering a whole mechanism just to determine what is useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and what isn't.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we can say that, but in the beginning nature *had* to go the mutation
<BR>
and selection route to get something that could organize itself and
<BR>
catalyze the production of more similar copies.
<BR>
<P>In fact, it is probably only when you get to the stage where you have
<BR>
a significant information content in a non-copyable form (e.g brains)
<BR>
that it makes sense to switch from a reproductive process to a
<BR>
preservation process.  In the beginning, the environmental niches
<BR>
were completely unoccupied, so making copies as a way of preserving
<BR>
the developed code was an important survival strategy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Besides, I am not aware of any experimental evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supporting these ideas (unless you know something I don't; for example, has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DNA repair the same efficiency in introns and exons?).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm fairly sure there is a difference in repair rates between transcribed and
<BR>
untranscribed genes.  Think about it for a minute -- how do you even *do*
<BR>
repair for the genes that are switched &quot;off&quot; in cells?  Shouldn't those
<BR>
genes be wrapped up in condensed DNA and unavailable to the repair enzymes?
<BR>
If so (or if the repair simply proceeds at a rate below the damage
<BR>
accumulation rate), then you are going to get an accumulation of defective
<BR>
DNA.
<BR>
<P>The genes that are &quot;forever&quot; turned off are only needed if you want to
<BR>
make a clone from the cell and so only show up as defective if you
<BR>
try to do that.  I have a hard time linking DNA damage with aging
<BR>
in active cells, where, in theory, the active genes should be repaired.
<BR>
But I could see something like a slow accumulation of iron or copper
<BR>
in the nucleus accelerating the rates at which DNA damage occurs
<BR>
such that the cell can't maintain a functional set of undamaged
<BR>
genes, leading to an eventual decline in cell function (e.g. aging).
<BR>
Note that I'm primarily discussing post-mitotic cells here, though
<BR>
this could be applied to some degree in infrequently dividing
<BR>
stem cells.
