<EM>&gt; modified organisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I was dumbfounded to hear a news report, allegedly sans editorial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;posturing, on the Aussie national TV news the other night refer to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;legislation that will require food growers and retailers to list details of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any GM-crop `contamination'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have heard this on UK and continental coverage also.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Shit, eh. I'm all for knowing what I eat, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I wonder why we don't hear more about added `vitamin contamination', `folic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;acid contamination', `iodine contamination' (of table salt)... The memetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;war is being won by default.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or contaminated by phosphates, insecticides and weedkillers indeed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The difference between GM and the others you mention is that GM spores are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freed into the environment to affect other (non-GM crops) whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farmers like it or not. There is also some evidence that ecological balance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (certain butterflies and so on) are harmed by GM cultivation.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, there is no evidence that butterflies are harmed by pesticides
<BR>
produced by plants in the field, and evidence to the contrary has been pretty
<BR>
overwhelming that the 'sky is falling' whines of the anti-GM greenies is
<BR>
unfounded in any way.
<BR>
<P>As for 'spores' being 'freed' into the environment, plants do not reproduce by
<BR>
'spores', so any greenies telling you that are obviously ignorant. Since
<BR>
agronomists are aware of the risks, they typically plant a band of crops around
<BR>
test fields that cannot cross pollinate with the test plants. THe pollen only
<BR>
drifts so far before settling to the ground, where it rots.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just because a technology is new, like GM, does not automatically mean it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good. Proper long term testing does not seem to have occurred with GM in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same way as a new drug testing, although the technology impacts on more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just because technology is new does not mean you have to fear it like the H
<BR>
Bomb.
<BR>
<P>Proper testing has progressed as far as it can in the laboratories. They must be
<BR>
tested in the field, but all attempts at this testing are being sabotaged by the
<BR>
anti-GM greenies, which proves that they are not, in fact, interested in 'proper
<BR>
testing'. That is merely a straw man for them to present themselves as
<BR>
'moderate' while they vilify their opponents.
