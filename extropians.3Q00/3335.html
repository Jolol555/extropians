You have put your finger on a salient point, Spike; such wild and unsupported accusations, made by a stranger, against someone who is not, cause one to wonder not if the accusations are true, but rather who such an accuser could be.  On the other hand, someone of such an ilk as that to which this accuser would seem to belong, simply because this person posted these accusations on a list run by the accused rather than forwarding them to the proper authorities for proper consideration, would probably view ALL publicity as positive.  Either this is the case, and this person is beneath either contempt or concern from us, or such an accusation was lobbed onto the list as a sociological exercise, to see (and perhaps write a report upon) how the list members would respond.  In either case, neither this person nor their accusations would seem to be worthy of even casual consideration, and I fully agree with their being stricken from the list.  We are also meme-savvy, and should not al!

low ourselves to be used in such a way.  If this person can be traced and their slander publicly pinned on them, I also support that action, if only to teach this person the existential lesson that actions entail consequences.
