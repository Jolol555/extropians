<EM>&gt; &gt;It seems very unfair to die young from a random unexpected accident. It seems unfair to suffer greatly from having one or two specific bad genes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It seems to me that if fairness were really measuring fitness, one or two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really bad genes would be seen as fairly signalling an inferior potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Isn't it more believable to hypothesize that genetic diseases that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significantly reduce the fitness of those who live to adulthood have,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for most of our evolutionary history, been a small and indistinguishable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fraction of diseases, so that our genes' notion of fairness has no selective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pressure to treat genetic diseases differently from other diseases that seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accidentally acquired?
</EM><BR>
<P>Another reason to oppose health insurance. By its nature, it coddles those with
<BR>
poor survival traits and punishes those with advantagous survival traits. Note
<BR>
that since the advent of health insurance and scientifically based health care,
<BR>
the percent of the population with poor eyesight has increased dramatically.
<BR>
Such people would have previously died off early due to accident, predation, or
<BR>
battle. This pattern tends to hold for all heritable medical maladies, as
<BR>
treatment to cure or mitigate the effects of such a malady become available, the
<BR>
percent of the population suffering from said malady increases. This trending
<BR>
indicates that unless we do undertake systematic gengineering to weed out these
<BR>
faulty recessives, our descendants are doomed to be rather ugly, stunted,
<BR>
malformed, disease prone, blind, deaf, and dumb Morlocks.
