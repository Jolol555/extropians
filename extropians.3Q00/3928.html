Jason Joel Thompson wrote,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Then you are creating a set which only has value if there is such a thing as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;not&quot;real.  But by your own definition, no such things exist (i.e.: Reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; = All things)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, reality = all real things (and all real non-things).
<BR>
Note that reality does not equal all unreal things.
<BR>
Unreality = all unreal things (and all unreal non-things).
<BR>
The definition remains valid and accurate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm suggesting a different way of looking at things entirely.  I accept the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concept of reality as a working model, but I do not have absolute belief in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an external reality.  Not yet anyway.  We do not currently have the ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to perceive reality directly.
</EM><BR>
<P>What do you mean &quot;we&quot;?
<BR>
Do you have a mouse in your pocket?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, it does.  If we draw the distinction you agree to above, the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'fact' we have is in our perception of reality.  Your belief in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existence of one reality is an article of faith, not fact.  Under current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operating conditions we are slaves to a sensory mode of existence.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't &quot;believe&quot; in one reality. I accept it as a fact of existence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Belief in reality makes perfect sense-- it fulfills our need for causal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationships.  This is a very human way of looking at the world.  We posit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that in the action of throwing a ball, a real object has moved from point A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to point B.  We may or may not be correct.  It may later be revealed, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instance, to have been a VR simulation (and you, the unwitting subject.)
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact that a person can be fooled into thinking that an illusion is real does
<BR>
*not* mean that a separate reality exists. It simply means that people can be
<BR>
fooled.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, belief in reality is obviously a good working model.  It is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convention of your mind that facilitates your existence.  I prefer however
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to leave that sliver of skeptism in my mind-- I trust my senses, but if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of things is shown to be fundamentally different, then I am prepared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be flexible.  Further, I am prepared to believe in no &quot;nature of things&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at all-- that we live in the emergent vapor of an existence that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illusory, for instance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nevertheless, the illusory existence comes from the ground of being, a single
<BR>
reality with a kaleidoscopic array of illusory aspects.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Heady stuff and apparently of very little practical use other than mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excercise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, like the man said, &quot;use it or lose it.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do hold however, that there are very practical ways in which we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leverage the plasticity of our perception of reality into control over that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality.  If I could sit you down in a room and have a conversation with you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it, I would, because a written explanation would be tiresome-- I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to spend too much time convincing you I was talking about something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational.  Indeed, extremely rational.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but how do you know it's *really* rational, rather than merely a reasonable
<BR>
illusion?
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Something beckons within the reach of each of us
<BR>
to save heroic genius. Find it, and do it.
<BR>
For as goes heroic genius, so goes humankind.&quot;
