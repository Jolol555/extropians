I was thinking of fellow members of the geeksquad; we think of travelling to
<BR>
Mars (or dissassembling it for spares), and forget that other people spend
<BR>
the same time thinking about getting a Suburban.
<BR>
<P>I like what you did with the Primo 3M+. I guess I'm wondering how large the
<BR>
trend will be toward body mods, when an external body (thought about like a
<BR>
car) might be easier, possible sooner, and more suited to many peoples'
<BR>
paradigms; especially when people are getting &quot;back to nature&quot; (I think that
<BR>
might mean eating each other, but I suspect that's not the common
<BR>
interpretation).
<BR>
<P>Personally, I don't really care about the body mods in the near future. As
<BR>
long as I can keep ticking along, decrepitude and all, I'm happy enough. I'm
<BR>
brute-force time travelling into the future.

<P><EM>&gt;I'm  convinced that &quot;telepresence robots&quot; will be a future move.
</EM><BR>
One path is as a natural evolution of the car. People love their
<BR>
cars, but they don't necessarily like being in them. Much better
<BR>
if you could stay at home, and drive your car from the safety
<BR>
of your loungeroom over your web tv (maybe the next version of
<BR>
the playstation will support this).&lt;
<BR>
<P>Yes, I agree with you that telepresence is one future direction,
<BR>
and one will continue to evolve.  I appreciated your emphasis
<BR>
on the automobile as an extension of the human body, but I don't
<BR>
understand why you would think that this concept is foreign to
<BR>
anyone, especially me.  My entire concept for Primo 3M+ is based
<BR>
on the future body as a vehicle.  The blueprint stats compare
<BR>
this future body to the current body in a layout design which
<BR>
is a spin on a car ad.
