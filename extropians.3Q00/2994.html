<EM>&gt;  &gt;Does anyone else here think is unfair and unjust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;that a woman can always get out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;responsibility for a child (before birth by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;aborting it and after birth by putting it up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;adoption), while a man can literally be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;responsible for hundreds of thousands in expenses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;just because he was careless enough not to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;rubber
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;  So, yeah it might be rough on fathers of unwanted kids.  But, hey, if 
</EM><BR>
you're 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  a man who does not want to have kids there are ways to avoid it.  If you 
</EM><BR>
are 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  careless, or get duped, or are just terribly unlucky, them's the breaks.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  When you get trimmed, just consider potential fatherhood one of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  potential costs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fair is not a concept that applies to these kinds of things. Careless has as 
<BR>
it's roots the word: care. 
<BR>
<P>Life ain't fair. Women know this better than anyone. It's not fair your 
<BR>
muscles are stronger than mine, is it? 
<BR>
; )
<BR>
In the real world, &quot;fair&quot; doesn't exist.  But cause and effect does. 
<BR>
<P>You could examine your motives (and concepts of self responsiblity) instead 
<BR>
of looking outward for the fix to this situation.
<BR>
<P>If you were care-ful or care-ing, then your woman who you've impregnated will 
<BR>
care too, and take your opinion into account. You'd have been care-giving in 
<BR>
nature and wouldn't want to father a child that was unwanted and 
<BR>
undersupported. We assume you'd BOTH have known that sperm can make women 
<BR>
pregnant.
<BR>
<P>If you were careful in all your affairs, you would have chosen a sex partner 
<BR>
who was intelligent and supportive as well, and would not make you or your 
<BR>
child suffer. She's have agreed to discuss it with you and you would both 
<BR>
agree on whether or not it was an accident that should be corrected, or 
<BR>
something to celebrate and care for. Fairness has nothing to do with it. 
<BR>
Taking care does.
<BR>
<P>If cause and effect is not something you care about, I agree with zero, get a 
<BR>
vasectomy.
