<P><EM>&gt; Since they would be nanodetectors that should be only interested in

<EM>&gt; with that, if its restricted to that.

<P>You know tho, as soon as they perfect helium detection, some yahoo
<BR>
will modify them to detect butt scratching.  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Have them set to set off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; air-network alarm through other nanites when they come in contact with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weapons grade plutonium, and to home in on sources of helium (which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an alpha decay product, right?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  I need to calculate how much helium is produced by a slightly
<BR>
subcritical mass of 239, but it sounds like it might work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;... diplomacy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so very much more effective if one has the appropriate weapons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to demonstrate one's sincerity.  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THe thing I find so funny is that the scientists who were adamant for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many years that MAD was unacceptable now find it acceptable rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have NMD.
</EM><BR>
<P>The irony is not lost on me.  Of course the present sitch has presented
<BR>
many such ironies.  Consider the conflict in Kosovo.  I had come to
<BR>
think that liberals were always against all war, but it was the left that
<BR>
urged UN intervention into that intractible morass.  The right wingers
<BR>
were downright dovish:  &quot;...Lets stay out of it, let them fight!  They dont
<BR>
even have any oil!&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, one of the reasons the US seems big on getting Russia in on being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an NMD player in alliance with us is that Russia owns a finger of land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that goes down the coast of the sea of Japan and touches on North Korea,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right around where NK missiles would fly if headed for the US...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and its obvious that Russia really does have enough nukes to
<BR>
overwhelm NMD, so why not bring them in as allies?  {I mean, other
<BR>
than the fact that they are COMMIES!}   In the next 5-20 yrs, the
<BR>
biggest threat on the horizon is China deciding to nuke Taiwan, and
<BR>
if that were to happen, what would we do?  Any ideas?  Im open to
<BR>
suggestion.  John?
