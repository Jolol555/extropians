<EM>&gt;I do think that libertarianism is a natural political philosophy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for an extropian to adopt.  Extropians believe in removing limits,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and libertarianism is that philosophy which puts the fewest limits on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people's actions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Earlier I posed questions about how modern liberalism could coexist with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an extropian philosophy.  What is the meaning of a minimum wage law,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when there is a continuum of intelligences from AI through transhuman?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How can the basic idea of social equality exist in a world where some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beings think millions of times faster than others?  It seems to me that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a laissez faire attitude will work best in the future we anticipate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...  Seriously, I can't understand how you can accept the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;massive changes which the concepts above entail, while still being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;married to modern social government concepts.
</EM><BR>
<P>The more things change, the more value we get from abstract and general,
<BR>
as opposed to context-dependent and specialized, approaches.
<BR>
<P>In the quote above, I think Hal is trying to contrast a general
<BR>
libertarian approach with fragile context-dependence &quot;social government
<BR>
concepts&quot;.  There is some truth in this, but I think less than Hal
<BR>
admits.  Axiomatic (e.g. Randroid) libertarian advice often seems to me
<BR>
to be rather fragile, being tied to notions of physical property and
<BR>
autonomous independent humans.  On the other side, many people with
<BR>
socialist sympathies often base their policy proposals on relatively
<BR>
general theories which can adapt quite a bit to changing circumstances.
<BR>
<P>I prefer to use standard economic theory for understanding future
<BR>
societies, including politics.  When things will change just a little,
<BR>
then simple trend analysis or analogies to similar cases, such as is
<BR>
popular in much policy analysis, will work reasonably well.  When
<BR>
things change a bit more, intuitive informal theory of the sort common
<BR>
in the social sciences can still work reasonably well.  But when things
<BR>
change a lot, trends don't continue and informal categories break down,
<BR>
and only the most abstract and general theory remains a reliable guide.
<BR>
<P>Standard economic theory and Paretian policy analysis is very general
<BR>
and can speak to the future scenarios of interest to us.  It often,
<BR>
but far from always, supports the sort of policy conclusions that
<BR>
libertarians come to.  When they disagree, I tend to go with economic
<BR>
theory.
