&lt;&lt;What we are 'hip' to is that socialists will continuously try to re-invent
<BR>
themselves, repaint their horse, change their names, invent new catch
<BR>
phrases,and deny that the con they are selling today has anything to do with
<BR>
the con
<BR>
they were shoving down people's throats yesterday at gun point. What we are
<BR>
'hip' to is that anarcho-capitalist free markets are quite as capable of
<BR>
maximizing freedom for the most people possible as any other system, and far
<BR>
better than most, including socialism. A social democracy is not a liberal
<BR>
democracy, no matter how much you try to insist it is so. One decrys the
<BR>
individual, the other celebrates it.&gt;&gt;

<P>Historical studies suggest strongly that many industrialist funded the nazis in the 1920's to off-set gains by the commies and the social democrats. I shan't shed a tear for the poor capitalists, who contributed to the Hitler Fund. Graft was already a feature of Bismarckian Germany for 50 years since its inception in 1866. These guys knew who they were funding. Also the nazis were heavilly into business in the reich-such as running everything from machine works to brothels.
