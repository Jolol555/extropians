My insurance - AmeriHealth pays up to 40% reimbursement on acupuncture and 
<BR>
massage therapy, or so their literature says.  I have no reason at this point 
<BR>
to really doubt it, but prob the 40% is a best case situation.  There is a 
<BR>
lot of buzzing going on about alternative therapies being legit, including 
<BR>
acupuncture and massage.  On the TV show Fit Resort and Spa, the male host 
<BR>
had acupuncture done on the air for his back pain.  He said he was very 
<BR>
nervous and skeptical but after having the needles in for a few minutes, his 
<BR>
back pain was much better.  Maybe his relief turned out to be temporary but 
<BR>
most of what I hear about alternative medicine is positive.  I'm thinking 
<BR>
about massage and acupuncture for my depression and spine ailment -- 
<BR>
spondylolysis, and to try to get off blood pressure medication.
