<EM>&gt;&gt;  that remixing genes in ways not pre-tested by millennia of  natural (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  indeed human) selection and broadcasting them everywhere in industrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  quantities might have horrible consequences? 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How do we get institutions and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interest groups to &quot;calm down&quot; and allow the science to be done in a fashion 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that will produce acceptable answers without prejudging the many 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;techno-soccial questions we face?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's all a matter of degree, no doubt. I certainly don't advocate
<BR>
hysterical acting-out tantrums. But there seems a willing and willful
<BR>
blindness on lists such as this one to the way corporations and militaries
<BR>
actually *do* routinely, and with malice aforethought, poison and kill and
<BR>
degrade us. 
<BR>
<P>What worries me more than that, though, is the fundamental problem of
<BR>
combinatorial explosions. Robert has mentioned that new chemicals arrive
<BR>
out of far corners of the phase space and therefore can't mate with the
<BR>
life forms of Earth, Jim. Maybe, in many cases, but then again the reason
<BR>
technology has developed many of those wonderful new substances is
<BR>
precisely that they *do* mimic existing biological hammers and spanners and
<BR>
bricks and beams and accelerants, often surpassing the effectivity of those
<BR>
obtained by natural selection's bumbling. Then we let them loose - no, we
<BR>
spread them far and wide by the benefits of capitalist marketing prowess -
<BR>
and hope they don't excite each other to a frenzy.
<BR>
<P>*Should* we `calm down', necessarily, if there's a chance that certain
<BR>
human interventions could have horrendous multiplier effects to our
<BR>
detriment and that of our sustaining environment? It is not prejudgement to
<BR>
pause while considering a case for and against X. You often hold the
<BR>
putative serial murderer in custody while investigating the charges, I
<BR>
think, rather than taking the chance of allowing a continued death spree.
<BR>
This is rough on the poor coot if he's not the baddun, but it makes sense
<BR>
on a generalized cost-benefit schema - or at least, I gather that's the way
<BR>
we've chosen to conduct our joint affairs lately, in th absence of
<BR>
omniscience. There might be a slicker extropian way I haven't heard of.
