<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Who ever said that free will = freedom from willfulness?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         In my experience, many people insist &quot;free will&quot; is &quot;having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ability to do otherwise&quot; even if this &quot;otherwise&quot; is other than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what someone really wants or their true &quot;willfulness&quot;.  As in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supposedly, some people freely choose hell by their actions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         If anyone really chooses eternal damnation, are they really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I don't beleive that eternal damnation is a real possibility, I see your
<BR>
question as meaningless.
<BR>
<P>Free Will is having the ability to choose freely without outside compulsion. Do
<BR>
we have our own internal programming which helps us make decisions? Yes. Is it
<BR>
so discretely deterministic that we are not able to make choices that seem to be
<BR>
counter to the most likely choice our programming would have us make? Definitely
<BR>
not. Are we able to break out of our programming and make new programming? Most
<BR>
definitely.
