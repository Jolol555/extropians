<P>
I intended to post this message a few days ago but apparently it wasn't
<BR>
successfully sent.  If it HAS already been sent and received,  please
<BR>
forgive me for posting it again.
<BR>
<P>First, I'd like to introduce Luke Howison, who began this discussion
<BR>
off-list.   I asked if it would be OK with him to forward parts of the
<BR>
discussion to the list, because it seemed the sort of thing that might be
<BR>
of general interest.  This will be Luke's first appearance on the list.  
<BR>
<P>Our hypotheses are: 1.  that more women than men hold non-scientific
<BR>
beliefs; and 2. that in general males tend to be more interested in
<BR>
mathematics and science than women.  
<BR>
<P>I know there have been studies supporting the 2nd hypothesis; I'm not
<BR>
sure about the first.  Unanswered questions include: 1. If either of the
<BR>
above hypotheses is true, what might be the explanation?  2. Would it be
<BR>
desirable to change the situation--eg. to target young girls for extra
<BR>
training in scientific areas?
<BR>
<P>An observation I made was that from birth boy and girl babies are
<BR>
generally treated differently, one difference being that girl babies are
<BR>
more closely protected.  I wondered if this early protection might
<BR>
prevent girls from developing an understanding of the way things work
<BR>
(eg. if a little girl isn't allowed to play on the see-saw she'd lack an
<BR>
early grasp of the concept that Work= Force x Distance) .

<P>...
<BR>
<P>For example, more women read (and believe in) horoscopes, more men than
<BR>
women are atheists etc.
<BR>
Closer to home, on this list there are fewer female posters than males.
<BR>
<P>What are the reasons for women as a group being  more
<BR>
interested in the psychic and spriitual than men?  Is it simply a
<BR>
cultural
<BR>
phenomena, with Western society encouraging sicence and technology as
<BR>
masculine pursuits, or does it have a more biological basis -
<BR>
gender-related
<BR>
hormones, brain structure and neurochemistry?
<BR>
Obviously our society expects women to be more emotional than men, but
<BR>
some
<BR>
studies have shown that the difference is because men hide their emotions
<BR>
more.
<BR>
Female-interest magazines tend to include subjects like:
<BR>
--&gt;  Horoscopes and 'Psychic Friends', clairvoyants and their ilk.
<BR>
Uncritical articles about faith healing, clairvoyants, ghosts, hauntings,
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
--&gt;  World-views which propound 'spiritual needs', are closely identified
<BR>
with emotional needs.
<BR>
--&gt;  A less scientific world-view, with a general lack of articles about
<BR>
scientific progress, some anti-scientific attitudes, etc.
<BR>
--&gt;  A noticeably Christian-values type viewpoint, expecting readers to
<BR>
have
<BR>
'virtues' and other emotionally-religiously connected concepts.  (Well,
<BR>
some
<BR>
of them!).
