&nbsp;------------------

<P><EM>&gt;I love what you say about have a beautiful psychology. As one
</EM><BR>
goes &quot;out-of-body&quot; by going on line, all that is visible (other
<BR>
than a typeface) is one's psyche. Sure we can go to a website,
<BR>
look at a picture, and sometimes the beauty inside is reflected
<BR>
outside. But. Too many times ugly people have beautiful skins,
<BR>
and they show their &quot;true colors&quot; on a list forum or in posts...
<BR>
&nbsp;or a person who seems frumpish and drab in person may have Beautiful
<BR>
Emotions and lovely thoughts, images...words flowing as an 
<BR>
online entity... this &quot;inside out&quot; approach is what first fascinated
<BR>
me about meeting people thru the net.&lt;
<BR>
<P>Thank you for your thoughts on this subject.
<BR>
<P>In the talk I gave at the recent Alcor Technology Conference,
<BR>
I repeated a phrase several times which I recently put in a large
<BR>
digital image which now pillars over my studio.  &quot;alphabetical
<BR>
letters arranged into words written in strings of algorythmic
<BR>
codes.&quot;  This phrase is taken out of the following 2-paragraph
<BR>
taken from my talk:
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Many of my current friends, I’ve never met. Most of my communications
<BR>
are alphabetical letters arranged into words written in strings
<BR>
of algorythmic codes. Most of the time I don’t know what my friends
<BR>
look like, or what they are feeling. Feelings are sometimes difficult
<BR>
to express in written words for fear we may come off weak or
<BR>
soft, vulnerable or naive.
<BR>
<P>&quot;When I think of our culture, I see it as a body of electronically
<BR>
connected data filtering messages into its appendages. Out into
<BR>
the capillaries of culture, our technology has become far more
<BR>
exacting and more robust than our biological bodies. Our biological
<BR>
bodies are far too inadequate to keep up with our ideas and the
<BR>
new landscapes we venture. From the telegraph to telecommunications,
<BR>
from the Net into Space, it is no longer just the written symbol—the
<BR>
word—being transported, we are the new transportees.&quot;
