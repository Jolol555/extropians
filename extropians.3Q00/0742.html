Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What would be interesting is to study the effects of long-term low-dose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exposure to mutagens/radiation.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Some of the studies I read were done at long periods of time. In fact, some
<BR>
mice and flies exposed to low doses of radiation actually lived longer
<BR>
(perhaps a form of hormetics?). See Strehler's book, around page 275.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also interesting would be using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mutagens/radiation to attempt to induce aging in non-aging organisms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously to induce aging in a non-aging organism would be tremendous. In a
<BR>
perfect world you would irradiate or knok-out some genes from some lobsters
<BR>
(or whatever) and get a beutiful Gompertz mortality curve, exponential
<BR>
increases in the incidence of dozens of diseases, etc. However, you would
<BR>
probably get increased mortality due to cancer or a few pathologies
<BR>
increasing with age, but not a coherent phenotype ressembling mammalian
<BR>
aging. I mean, if many gerontologists don't consider Werner's syndrome
<BR>
accelerated aging, why would they consider whatever deleterious phenotype
<BR>
you could give to lobsters as aging? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Do you have studies that cite the clone failure rate and developmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abnormalities are the same with foetal cells *and* adults?
</EM><BR>
<P>[Hill et al., 2000]
<BR>
<P>They took cells from an old steer and made a clone. Then they took cells
<BR>
from the clone in the foetal stage and made a new clone; they got viable
<BR>
calfs in both experiments with similar results regarding abnormal calfs and
<BR>
abortions. West's latest experiment concerned young cells and cells aged in
<BR>
vitro and the results were the same. Finally, there was a Korean team that
<BR>
also used in vitro aged cells and found that they were better for cloning.
<BR>
Of course that you can argue that in vitro aged cells are not the same thing
<BR>
as in vivo and that the cells in the foetus are not that different from the
<BR>
adult steer's. But still ...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I would not have expected that people would have done these studies yet,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certainly not in replicated work that you can make strong claims about.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, they're not conclusive experiments but make one think.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It sounds like you are mixing apples and oranges.  Mitotic cells in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my mind cannot be classed as &quot;soma&quot;.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Really? Don't tell that to Kirkwood cause his research is largely based on
<BR>
that assumption.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My brain cells typically don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;divide and that is the &quot;soma&quot; that when disposed of causes the problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you think post-mitotic cells are the pacemakers of aging? If so, how do
<BR>
they spread aging throughout the body? Hormones?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In the long run even the bodies of Sequoia trees are disposable!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly in bacteria or endlessly self-cloning plants there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no &quot;soma&quot; to dispose of.  The entire organism is &quot;reproductive&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There *is* aging however in that some fraction of those reproductive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cells are likely to be sterile.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't get it. Bacteria are sterile because of aging!? Also, some tissues
<BR>
from plants with vegetative reproduction cannot be used for reproduction and
<BR>
yet don't show aging (I'm thinking about leaves).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Guarante's work in budding yeast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shows that cellular aging does occur and it is caused by what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effectively DNA damage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Although the basic principles of life are the same for all organisms, there
<BR>
is no reason to believe yeast senescence has anything to do with human
<BR>
aging. In addition, as you should know, the &quot;DNA damage&quot; presumably causing
<BR>
S.cerevisiae to age is completely different from the DNA mutations generally
<BR>
quoted as causing human aging.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; In addition, studies done in biotechnology show that cells can overexpress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; large amounts of trangenic genes without any noticeable deleterious effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; (unless a toxic product is involved, of course).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not sure that I see how this applies.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I was pointing that expressing a few more genes is not deleterious to cells
<BR>
and therefore cellular senescence should not be regarded as the outcome of
<BR>
shifting &quot;energy&quot; from repair to other functions. At least in proliferative
<BR>
cells.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you want to harvest a nonsecretable protein, you don't much care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether the cell is sterile, you simply care what its yield was.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's just a minor detail, but when you want cells to produce some protein,
<BR>
you want them to reproduce as quick as possible. So you should to care
<BR>
whether they're sterile or not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm fairly sure there is a difference in repair rates between transcribed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;untranscribed genes.  Think about it for a minute -- how do you even *do*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;repair for the genes that are switched &quot;off&quot; in cells?  Shouldn't those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genes be wrapped up in condensed DNA and unavailable to the repair enzymes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If so (or if the repair simply proceeds at a rate below the damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accumulation rate), then you are going to get an accumulation of defective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;DNA.
</EM><BR>
<P>Although large sections of chromosomes can be non-coding regions, small
<BR>
introns and exons can often alternate. And it can also depend on the type of
<BR>
error (if you have a break in the DNA it is repaired no matter its place).
<BR>
One thing that has always troubled me is: if non-coding regions are so easy
<BR>
to mutate and lose, how come they exist in such large amounts? I don't
<BR>
recall in detail my classes on the subject but I don't remember studying DNA
<BR>
repair mechanisms specific of coding regions. Perhaps they exist but, until
<BR>
further evidence, I cannot accept them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The genes that are &quot;forever&quot; turned off are only needed if you want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make a clone from the cell and so only show up as defective if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to do that.  I have a hard time linking DNA damage with aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in active cells, where, in theory, the active genes should be repaired.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But I could see something like a slow accumulation of iron or copper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the nucleus accelerating the rates at which DNA damage occurs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such that the cell can't maintain a functional set of undamaged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;genes, leading to an eventual decline in cell function (e.g. aging).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Note that I'm primarily discussing post-mitotic cells here, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this could be applied to some degree in infrequently dividing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stem cells.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's admit you're right, how do you think non-aging species cope with this?
<BR>
Unknown repair mechanisms?
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
