<EM>&gt; As far as I know the MWI is not a theory about physical, real,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; objective worlds. These worlds are - for the observer - just a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjective concept, perceptions, consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All these worlds form the universe, which is real, one,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical, objective.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's my understanding that expert opinions differ considerably over this
<BR>
matter of alternate histories being real or possibly real. David Deutsch
<BR>
argues for the actual reality of all conceivable branching histories
<BR>
that could result from different quantum events. Others, like Seth Lloyd
<BR>
and Murray Gell-Mann, have seemed to indicate that, while Many Worlds is
<BR>
the best explanation of quantum happenings, the other Worlds should be
<BR>
looked at as only potentially real, but not actually real? Deutsch and
<BR>
Lloyd even had a brief debate on the this matter on the Hotwired web
<BR>
site, back last year sometime, I think.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; But the number or worlds is very far from being defined.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; These worlds continue to multiply!.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am reminded here that a really worthwhile source of detail on the
<BR>
general properties of Many Worlds theories is Michael Clive Price's
<BR>
&quot;Everett FAQ&quot;, at <A HREF="http://www.hedweb.com/everett/everett.htm#splitsh">http://www.hedweb.com/everett/everett.htm#splitsh</A>
<BR>
Here, under the slightly misleading heading, &quot;Could we detect other
<BR>
Everett-worlds?&quot;, Price describes an interestingly advanced experiment
<BR>
for someday &quot;proving&quot; that a alternate worlds exist. *However*, and
<BR>
unfortunately for the sake of *really* proving this point, what Price
<BR>
describes is just a more realistic version of the old Shroedinger's Cat
<BR>
conundrum. In effect, Price just wants to put a special, reversible
<BR>
computer into a superposition of two different states, then he wants to
<BR>
reverse the whole procedure so that the computer is gently brought back
<BR>
out of the superposition, without the whole unusual effect being
<BR>
&quot;collapsed&quot; or decohered before the end of the experiment. This is not
<BR>
really anything quite like &quot;detecting another world&quot;, and on that level
<BR>
it might seem a bit disappointing. However, this *is* an advanced idea
<BR>
for inferring that a really weird superposition &quot;must have happened&quot;
<BR>
inside a closed box.
<BR>
<P>As an advanced superposition demo, Price's scenario seems much more
<BR>
convincing to me than the old Schroedinger's Cat idea ever did. In other
<BR>
words, if Price's computer could be indirectly shown to have &quot;thought
<BR>
two ways at the same time&quot;, that would represent a superposition that
<BR>
would be hard not to think of as involving two separate, existing worlds
<BR>
at that point. Note though, that everything in this superposition has to
<BR>
be reversed exactly without contacting the outside world in any way, in
<BR>
order for the inference of two &quot;overlapping computer thoughts&quot; to work.
<BR>
So nothing can really be proven, since you don't actually get any
<BR>
message or info from the two separate &quot;worlds&quot; of the superposition!
<BR>
Looks to me like I have to be an &quot;agnostic forever&quot; on this, since there
<BR>
is no sure way to tell the reality of indirect inferences of events
<BR>
previously set up (and then reversed).
