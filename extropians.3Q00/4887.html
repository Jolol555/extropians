<EM>&gt; &gt;Considering that Nazis are in fact SOCIALISTS, your claim that McVeigh and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Christian Identity is 'conservative' is disengenuous at best, and a total lie at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;worst, but thats never stopped you before. In fact, the ease with which most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;socialists fit in with the eco-fanatic primitivist types demonstrates that his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;drift toward Kazynskism is not that far of a reach for him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, you would not consider either those trying to conserve racial/ethnic purity (not a laudable goal) or those trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to conserve environmental diversity and cleanliness (a more laudable one) as conservative?  Interesting.  Equally interesting is the specific claim that Christian Identity is not conservative.  On the bipolar conservative-to-liberal spectrum, I sincerely doubt if either they or social liberals would care to be associated with each other.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you actually study the economic planks of neo-nazi groups, as well as their
<BR>
attitude toward internationalism, what you will find is a very
<BR>
populist/socialist platform that would not be out of place at the Green Party
<BR>
Convention. Remember that the KKK's political base prior to the 60's, dating
<BR>
back to Resconstruction, was entirely in the Democratic Party. If you read
<BR>
Bellamy's novel, Looking Backward, which is considered a landmark American
<BR>
Socialist novel, and which kicked off Nationalism movements throughout the
<BR>
western world (which were always socialist oriented), you will see that it is a
<BR>
socialist platform. The religious right, that originates in the Southern US, was
<BR>
originally solidly Democratic, but split (as part of the Dixiecrats, originally)
<BR>
over things like civil rights, gay/lesbian rights, separation of church &amp; state,
<BR>
etc.  Them joining the Republicans is about as logical as Buchanan joining the
<BR>
Reform Party. I just wish he had done a better job of drawing more bigots away
<BR>
from the party.
<BR>
<P>Socialist liberals do not like neo-nazis only because they actually compete on
<BR>
the same arguments to different constitutencies. This was evident during the
<BR>
Weimar Republic, where Brownshirt and Communist groups would wage streetfights,
<BR>
not because they opposed each other ideologically, but because they competed for
<BR>
the same constituency. If you study the propaganda put out by communists,
<BR>
socialists, and fellow travelers during WWII, you (and George Orwell noticed
<BR>
this) will notice that what they publicly think of Hitler was directly reflected
<BR>
by the day by day status of the secret alliance between Stalin and Hitler. When
<BR>
they split poland, Hilter was a friend of socialism. When he broke the treaty,
<BR>
he was a bad guy again. Communists and socialists in the US were brought up fed
<BR>
the pap put out by the Soviet propaganda machine about the 'Great Patriotic War'
<BR>
against Hitler, and try to deny that Stalin was ever in league with him.
