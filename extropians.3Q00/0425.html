<P>
In respect of the matter of synesthesia; alternative modalities of
<BR>
sensory-cognitive functioning....
<BR>
<P>When i was in mid-adolescence and beginning my love affair with the mind; I
<BR>
was somewhat preoccupied with the ideas of Laing.
<BR>
<P>So I set about at age 15 to induce &amp; train the hallucinatory modalities. I
<BR>
started via the hypnagogic &amp; hypnopompic states that border sleep.
<BR>
<P>Within 3 weeks I could induce such states ...and cultivate auditory &amp; visual
<BR>
hallucinations while awake but relaxed. Extremely lucid dreaming came my
<BR>
way... if I were religious... I could well imagine that my experiences might
<BR>
compare in depth with Joan of Arc's or the Fatima trio.
<BR>
<P>The pressures of studies &amp; growing up into an extremely harassing adult
<BR>
world put my experiments to rest... but I found that I couldn't shake the
<BR>
&quot;hallucinations&quot;.
<BR>
<P>They became a totally voluntary part of my mentality. When I took up music;
<BR>
the notes had shape &amp; colour and texture... my sleep-dreams were enriched...
<BR>
and of course, I started perceiving the auras; tunnels and out-of-body
<BR>
experiences that LSD users; Near Death survivors; and my African;
<BR>
Amerinidian; and Hindu mystic friends told me about so much later...
<BR>
<P>I've run into lots of bona fide formally diagnosed schizophrenics and have
<BR>
had very interesting conversations with them. The chief difference between
<BR>
us, I think, is that I integrate my experiences into my personality; yet
<BR>
such experiences do not dominate or persuade me in any way... it's like
<BR>
lucid dreaming while awake. I maintain perspective.
<BR>
<P>Even though I am a mathphobe at heart (...and proudly manipulate symbols,
<BR>
deliberately refraining from visualization - which I think is a trap
<BR>
here...) I find that with certain kinds of math... especially dynamics in a
<BR>
system space... I seem to get an intuitive visual idea that facilitates
<BR>
mathematical creativity in problem setup.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, when I was thirtysomething... I was hit by leptosporosis... it was a
<BR>
bit misdiagnosed and I felt the full brunt of the fevers with
<BR>
hallucinations.
<BR>
<P>In three weeks I endured literal lifetimes...suffered fabulous places and
<BR>
landscapes; and terror &amp; fascination like I have never experience since. All
<BR>
I prayed for was to exit those runaway universes... preferably by
<BR>
recovery... but perhaps also via death.
<BR>
<P>I got my first wish... but came awfully close to having the second
<BR>
fulfilled.
<BR>
<P>The synesthetic modality and the hallucinatory one are related - probably
<BR>
somewhere deep in the temporal cortex... but once it is awoken and trained
<BR>
it marks you for life.
