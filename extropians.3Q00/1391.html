<P>I'm pretty sure it gets explained by the costs exceeding the benefits.
<BR>
You have to sacrifice a huge amount (imagine the rate of change
<BR>
post-singularity) to go off and colonize another star system.
<BR>
It probably effectively exiles you from the original stellar
<BR>
economy (whatever that looks like).  Sure, you can be a hermit,
<BR>
go off and live quietly in the forrest, but you don't run around
<BR>
building megacities in the forrest because you know that has
<BR>
already been done and the people who have done it are way
<BR>
ahead of you on the curve.  Robin might disagree with this however. 
<BR>
<P>One way to look at it would be -- would the colonists have left
<BR>
England if they *knew* all they would ever be able to achieve
<BR>
would be a pale reflection of whatever England would come to be?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But Robert, Big Ideas (...and that's ...big!) need big science.... even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though it's almost all we have to work with; are you sure 20th Century
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science paints a good enough picture of the world to extrapolate this kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of stuff??
</EM><BR>
<P>The observations from the gravitational microlensing observations
<BR>
estimate 200 billion thingys with an average mass of ~0.3 M_sun.
<BR>
Those would not, as the article I pointed out by Katherine Freese,
<BR>
fit any current theory.
<BR>
<P>The scientists are clearly at a loss.  All I've proposed is that
<BR>
many technological civilization can evolve to the limits of physics.
<BR>
Because those limits are reached in relatively uniform environments
<BR>
(such as interstellar space), the forms those civilizations take are
<BR>
relatively similar (due to convergent evolution).  Unless the laws
<BR>
of physics are radically different from those we currently know,
<BR>
I think current science is sufficient to make the preductions I've
<BR>
made.  Mind you, I don't say I've found the ultimate end-point
<BR>
of evolution, but simply a plateau that cannot be exceeded unless
<BR>
the engineering of subatomic matter is feasible.
<BR>
<P>(Its also worth noting that these ideas are by and large due to
<BR>
Anders, Perry, Keith, and other people who have been on the list
<BR>
at various times.  All I've done is put some flesh on the bones.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Especially when your life is hanging by a thread (...a VERY finite maximal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifespan)??
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but to &quot;want&quot; the life, it should probably be fun, and the most
<BR>
fun I get now-a-days is poking scientists in the side and saying
<BR>
&quot;Hey, *waaaake up*, why don't you look at this idea...&quot;, and then
<BR>
watching them run screaming into the night.
<BR>
<P>This is actually part of a longer term agenda of mine.  I want
<BR>
to go to school off and on over many many years, learn many
<BR>
things but never &quot;earn&quot; a degree.  Hopefully someplace along
<BR>
the way I come up with something clever enough in the long
<BR>
run that somebody simply hands me an honorary degree.
<BR>
