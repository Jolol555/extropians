<P><EM>&gt;Probably most people here (including myself) would cringe at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;idea of &quot;forced 'anything'&quot;, but in the situation of a person with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an acute mental illness (such as schizophrenia), the benefit to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person and friend/family is overwhelmingly large. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hospitalization accomplishes several things. It enables the health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;professionals to observe the person in a controlled setting, so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other medical illnesses, that might be causing the symptoms can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ruled out. If medication is started, then the medical staff can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;watch for side effects. Also the hospital stay offers the family and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;friends a brief rest from what is often extremely stressful and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;harrowing days/nights leading up to the ill person's hospital stay.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a difficult and complex situation because intervention can be
<BR>
coercive and it can also be a necessary and considerate action.  In some
<BR>
instances, family members or friends have an agenda that is actually not
<BR>
fully considerate of a person's illness or is misinformed about the
<BR>
illness.  Also, in several programs that I have worked with for
<BR>
underprivileged or mentally ill, it was difficult to locate family members
<BR>
or friends.  
<BR>
<P>I have a friend who is schizophrenic and his family was supportive of
<BR>
getting him to the hospital and on medication.  This support was the most
<BR>
productive alternative for him and his self-esteem.  Today, he is capable
<BR>
of working but he refuses to because he would not have the monetarily
<BR>
relief which is provided for him because of his illness.  This is another
<BR>
complex subtopic, but briefly it resembles a treadmill because if he works
<BR>
he will not receive money from the government. And if he works his salary
<BR>
might not be sufficient enough to cover the costs of the medications. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I know that it's dangerous when oppressive governments see mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;institutions as a convenient tool with which to supress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;indesirable&quot; voices in the population. The former Soviet Union was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably best known for using mental institutions this way. Because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the concept of forced institutionalism is such an fragile (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emotional and dangerous) concept, it's a perfect example for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;libertarians and anarchists to think about and address in order to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prepared for the future when we have more minimal government (call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me an optimist).
</EM><BR>
<P>Optimist!  I'd prefer a minimized government as well, and an upgrade in
<BR>
overall public knowledge. 
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the closing note and book suggestion.
