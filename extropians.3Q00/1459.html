<P>Ja, except that this example is misleading.  The famous $x00 hammer
<BR>
that started the meme that the government was being wasteful, etc,
<BR>
was a modal hammer, which is a device that looks a little like a hammer
<BR>
but the similarities end there.  It is not used for driving nails at all, but
<BR>
has accelerometers mounted on it to measure resonances and vibration
<BR>
modes.  If you or I were to try to buy such a device that the government
<BR>
bought for $x00, it would cost us twice as much since we dont purchase
<BR>
in quantity.  spike
