<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
I’m sorry that I am unable to respond to Waldemar Ingdahl in
<BR>
length on this topic at this time.  However, I did try to reply
<BR>
to your questions and clear up some oversights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What signals do we send to the outside? What persons get interested
</EM><BR>
in transhumanism? What do they learn about transhumanism inside
<BR>
the movement, and how do they react to it?&lt;
<BR>
<P>What signals we send to those outside our culture is reflected
<BR>
in the data, the ideas, we transmit though communicative devices.
<BR>
&nbsp;Such communication devices are books, interviews, educational
<BR>
courses, videos, films, images, music, meetings, conferences,
<BR>
gatherings.  Importantly, our one-on-one interactions with other
<BR>
people both professionally and personally. How we affect society
<BR>
can be obtained, in part, by understanding history, civilization,
<BR>
culture and the current needs of society.  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;But what, Natasha, is the philosophical content being transcieved
</EM><BR>
by those methods, language, jargon, symbols, and style? What
<BR>
do we write on the keyboard, what ideas do we imply (. . .)?
<BR>
<P>It’s more than a mere implication, it is a matter of informing,
<BR>
expressing and educating.  We write on our keyboards our world
<BR>
views pertaining to what issues concern us: how to solve problems
<BR>
and develop an ethical basis for thinking.  We communicate ideas
<BR>
about extending and preserving life, augmenting intelligence
<BR>
and creativity, critical thinking, designing more durable robotics
<BR>
and prosthetics, cloning of organs, designing of organs, designing
<BR>
of bodies, developing ways to communicate digitally, creating
<BR>
new life forms, designing multiple personas, exploring human
<BR>
consciousness, developing artificial intelligence (machine intelligence),
<BR>
developing molecular technologies such as nanotechnologies, the
<BR>
singularity, discovering applications for nanotechnology such
<BR>
as nanomedicine, exploring the solar system and universe, designing
<BR>
space habitats, and the list goes on and on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It has an impact, but what impact? A computer can be used to
</EM><BR>
transmit many kinds of ideas, even ideas that vividly oppose
<BR>
to computers being used. A newspaper can be used propagate the
<BR>
opinion of the abolishment of the freedom of press. The media
<BR>
isn't synonymous with the message. And one must take care to
<BR>
look at what is being said on this forum, which is one of the
<BR>
main foci of transhumanist discourse.&lt;
<BR>
<P>The impact of combined and diverse fields of knowledge(economics,
<BR>
philosophy, aesthetics, sciences, technology, history, etc.),
<BR>
depends on the message and the manner in which the message is
<BR>
being delivered, as well as who the readers or listeners are.
<BR>
&nbsp;There is no question that we must be responsible and consider
<BR>
what we write in this forum, as in the many other forums, when
<BR>
we are presenting new ideas, hashing out old ideas, debating
<BR>
concepts, making announcements and having fun.  Such topics of
<BR>
discussion on this list must come from the people on this list
<BR>
and in this community.  Otherwise, it cannot be a true representation
<BR>
of our culture.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;I have used the word &quot;balance&quot; many times.  Balance knowledge,
</EM><BR>
balance experience and balance information so that the scales
<BR>
do not tilt so far in one direction that the an attention deficit
<BR>
results.  While walking around espousing far reaching concepts,
<BR>
our culture must know how to listen to the verse.  What we need
<BR>
is to take a hard look at our culture and determine if it can
<BR>
be a broad-based culturally effective, socially sophisticated
<BR>
point of view including cross-disciplinary knowledge comprised
<BR>
of the most sophisticated sciences, technologies, arts and its
<BR>
communications.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But what is the verse? 
</EM><BR>
<P>The verse I was referring to was a metaphor for what we represent
<BR>
-- and what we are saying.  In other words, &quot;walk the walk.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;Some basic examples are (1) why talk about extreme life extension
<BR>
while not taking care of oneself;  (2) why talk super intelligent
<BR>
while not taking the time to learn how to deploy common sense
<BR>
in interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships; (3) why talk
<BR>
about advancing transhumanist ideas while not advancing one’s
<BR>
own self-worth?  It can be confusing, and it can send awkward
<BR>
messages to talk about solving the world problems while not dealing
<BR>
with personal problems or not willing to understand how other
<BR>
people or societal groups function.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What is the reaction of society towards us? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Complex.  My experience is that its best to communicate in a
<BR>
way so that those I am communicating with can comprehend.  Not
<BR>
always easy, but worth the effort. Overall, I think society wants
<BR>
to live longer and feel better.  If we can provide this in a
<BR>
unthreatening manner, than we have an angle.  If we shout at
<BR>
them they may turn away. In communicating it’s important to listen,
<BR>
ask questions, and offer solutions with confidence and knowledge.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To understand it, and being able to respond to that in an appropriate
</EM><BR>
manner we need to have a world view, a description of history,
<BR>
present, and future, to which we can refer.
<BR>
<P>The extropian philosophy is a world view.  On anothe note, I
<BR>
think society does contain aspects of transhumanism, as transhumanist
<BR>
ideas flood the news, appear on the cover of magazines, are written
<BR>
about and discussed and debated in public forums.  Further, history
<BR>
of  transhumanist beginning are document by me in my book, however
<BR>
brief, as well as documented by others in their writings.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This weekend I re- read Virginia Postrel's excellent book &quot;The
</EM><BR>
future and its enemies&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>Virginia, who I like a lot, writes about dynamists.  Spontanous
<BR>
order is in the extropian principles.  While Virginia’s ideas
<BR>
are not new, they are important ideas, but I do not find them
<BR>
contraversial.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Transhumanism is not a smorgasboard of ideas, or a &quot;bring your
</EM><BR>
own&quot;. Philosophical smorgasboards are not coherent, and therefor
<BR>
often weak through their inherent contradictions. &quot;Bring your
<BR>
own&quot; introduces, often badly supported biases and contradictions.
<BR>
And therefor transhumanism needs a discourse to clarify its tenments
<BR>
and its world view.
<BR>
<P>There are different types of transhumanists, as there are humanists.
<BR>
&nbsp;Transhumansit FM-2030 authored his view of transhumanism which
<BR>
is different than what I wrote in the Transhumanist Statement,
<BR>
and both are different than Extropian transhsumansim. There are
<BR>
factors that we agree on, and some that we do not, but we are
<BR>
all transhumansits.   People have contradictions, and there may
<BR>
be some contradictions within various groups of transhumansits,
<BR>
but what is important is to recognize basic underlying values.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In order to create new philosophical currents that are appealing,
</EM><BR>
one has to bring forward an alternative that is practical and
<BR>
moral. And that requires depth.
<BR>
<P>What do you mean by depth?  There are many indepth books and
<BR>
articles available all over the place.  I hope you aren’t saying
<BR>
that knowledgeable creative thinkers lack depth -:)
<BR>
<P>Ideas and innovations are the products of creative mind stretching.
<BR>
&nbsp;For example, society understands story telling, and it is an
<BR>
effective way to communicate regardless of the format (book,
<BR>
film, music, lecture, etc.) and the themes (economics, history,
<BR>
etc) help to educate the public.  Also, myths are an effective
<BR>
way to show examples of various different scenarios:  *if* such
<BR>
and such happens *than* such and such might occur.  These are
<BR>
example of competent tools for memetic engineering and such proves
<BR>
beneficial when the content of ideas (such as listed above or
<BR>
in any books available for you to read) stem from broadly based
<BR>
knowledge.
