<EM>&gt; &gt;Just try to do an integral while you are laughing...

<P>I do that too.  Or Wodehouse, with his Jeeves and Wooster.

Jokes within jokes.  I have been known to be quietly at work

for hours, then suddenly get the gag from the week before, and:

WAAAAhahahahaahahaaaaaaa....   No wonder I have that...

<P>Now, back to mooses or meese.  Im trying to reframe this
<BR>
whole evolutionary argument in terms of something I am
<BR>
trained in, feedback control loops.  With the big antlers
<BR>
example I am postulating a positive feedback loop that
<BR>
envelopes a negative feedback loop.  If we can model
<BR>
the only two mechanisms for population genetic drift,
<BR>
survival selection and mate selection, in terms of negative
<BR>
and positive feedback loops, then evolution can be simulated
<BR>
on a computer.  All that is known in the field of feedback
<BR>
control systems (which is a lot)  will be accessible to the field
<BR>
of evolution studies.
<BR>
<P>If we manage to do that, evolution becomes far more
<BR>
satisfying than a lotta pointless theoretical ruminations.  We will
<BR>
be given a means of actually testing our notions, experimentation.
<BR>
Like the up-coming missile intercept attempt, the long-winded
<BR>
philosophical arguments get an exclamation point at the end,
<BR>
not just a period; or as often the case with evolutionary theory,
<BR>
a comma.  spike
