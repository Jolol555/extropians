<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What am I looking for? ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You claim some kind of communication with an animal. Whether you call it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; spiritual or something else, you have offered that this connection was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; real and that something meaningful was transferred between the two of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you. My questions: What kind of &quot;communication&quot; do you think took place?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Do you think this possible with other animal forms? Do you think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; specific situation gave rise to this communicatory feeling, or do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think this is something more general?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll start with the 2nd question about communication between humans and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animals other than coyotes, because my background might shed light on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience with the coyote.  As a child I lived in a large city, but my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; family had a country place where we spent weekends. I'd spend the whole of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each weekend wandering the woods and fields on foot or horseback. I was only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a small child when I first started hanging out in the woods, and the animals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seemed to realize that I wasn't a threat to them.  I can remember playing a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of hide-and-seek game with young white-tailed deer, whose personalities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are something like domestic goats'--they're very curious and playful when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they're young.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Sounds lovely! My childhood was spent on a pig farm with dogs, chickens,
<BR>
and cats. I got along famously with the everything except the pigs. I
<BR>
was very small and I fear they viewed me as something of a runt, so took
<BR>
no care with regards to my safety. One of my earliest memories is of the
<BR>
day when the pigs broke free of their pen while I was outside playing
<BR>
fairly far from our house. When they saw me they rushed at me in a big
<BR>
herd grunting their war chants. I was able to climb partially up a tree,
<BR>
but not before one of them tried very hard to bite off my foot. I don't
<BR>
think I'll ever forget that day. I had always been very nervous around
<BR>
them, and I think they sensed/remembered that when they were free that
<BR>
day. It's quite likely that if it hadn't been for that tree, I wouldn't
<BR>
be having this conversation with you right now. =)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I was around 11 years old, I found a baby pigeon who'd fallen from her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nest.  She was a tiny, naked thing that I had to feed gruel from a medicine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dropper, but she survived to adulthood, brought home a mate (I never kept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her penned)and raised babies of her own.  She somehow knew which window of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the house was mine and would perch on the window ledge and peck at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window until I'd go out and feed her some grain.  One day she came to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window, but when I went outside she didn't fly to the feeding area.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discovered that someone had shot her in the breast with a pellet air rifle,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and she'd come home to die.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I've often found baby birds who've fallen from their nests. Sometimes
<BR>
I'm able to lift them back up without touching them with my skin. Other
<BR>
times, heeding the advice of my parents given so long ago, I leave them
<BR>
for the adult birds to decide what to do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I was 14, my special horse, Mohammed Abu Tabik, was born out of one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my mares. I always called him Andy. When he was two years old my father
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hired a man to help me greenbreak him, which is to say, train the horse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the extent of putting a saddle on his back and getting into the saddle. From
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that point on, I trained him on my own.  I never put a bit into his mouth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (although when I took him to a place that might be noisy and frightening
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as a motorcycle race--I kept him in the city while I was in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highschool--I would sometimes use a hackamore).  He threw me a few times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when we were first getting to know each other well, but never out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meanness--he'd always turn around and look at me curiously as though he was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wondering what I was doing sitting on the ground. After a while, I had only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lean slightly to let him know which way I wanted to go. No one else could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever ride him--he was fearsome and wild with everyone but me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could go on at great length, but maybe these examples are enough to show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I have communicated with non-humans from the time I was a young child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that I'm familiar with the different ways in which different animals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communicate.  As you might expect from the rest of what I've said, I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also well acquainted with dogs.  One in particular, a black lab by the name
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Henry, was one of my closest childhood friends.  Of course, this may say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as much about the lonely nature of my childhood as about my rapport with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-humans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Perhaps. What it does indicate, as you point out, is that you have had
<BR>
ample opportunities to communicate, or at least share some kind of
<BR>
bond/connection, with animals other than humans. I've often felt that I
<BR>
have a very good rapport with animals, especially of the domestic kind.
<BR>
I don't consider myself a &quot;cat person&quot;, quite the opposite in fact. But,
<BR>
it never fails that whenever I'm at a place that has cats, they flock to
<BR>
me covering me in their hair. *sigh*
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, the coyote is a close relative of the dog--in fact the 2 species can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interbreed &amp; many of the coyote-like animals in the wild seem to be part
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dog, judging by their dogesque singing voices. The animal I cut from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fence appeared to be pure coyote.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I have seen the dog Henry react the same way the coyote did.  Once he had a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small wound which became infested with larvae of the screw worm fly, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is apparently now extinct, thanks to the release of thousands of sterile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; males. The screw worm fly would lay eggs in a wound, and when the eggs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hatched the larvae would eat the flesh of the unfortunate host.  Many cattle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were lost to screw worms.  The larvae had eaten a hole about half an inch
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deep in Henry's side, and we had to dig them out with a Q-tip disinfected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with Lysol.  It was obvious that the digging was painful, but Henry lay very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still and let us work on him.  The coyote was the same way.  I don't for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second believe that she understood my words.  Rather, it was the tone of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voice, and possibly some other (unidentified) signal that went from me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her.  Could be smell.  I've heard old-timers say that animals can smell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fear.  I know I've smelled fear on humans--their sweat has a peculiar odor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they're afraid.  Maybe animals can smell friendship as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
That is quite possible. There have been a number of studies looking at
<BR>
pheromones and their effects on human behavior. Also, there have been
<BR>
studies that look at animal communication where the primary tool for
<BR>
getting across information seems to be chemical/olfactory in nature. The
<BR>
studies done that look at human/animal communication, are in my opinion,
<BR>
poorly designed, and often executed even worse. There are some
<BR>
exceptions most notably within chimp/human communication.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; OK, I think that takes care of all three questions.  No formal studies, only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lifetime of experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Formal studies are never a prerequisite for acceptable discussion. I
<BR>
hope I didn't give the impression otherwise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Another question for both of us: Is this connection possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with other life forms? Plants and trees are a good example here. Many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believe that their plants understand and respond to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; communications. Do you believe this is true?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, no, no!  Ain't gonna get me to go down THAT road, not today anyhow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, OK, yes I communicate with my damned plants. So be it.  What can I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why, or why not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, here's a simple example.  A French mulberry plant tells me it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering from heat and water stress by drooping its leaves very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pathetically.  Yes, I know it's actually drooping the leaves to prevent loss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of water vapor through the stomata.  But it communicates its condition to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nevertheless. I'm not going to try to justify talking to plants.  You have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to BE there, I think.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I think you're probably right about this. I think that communication
<BR>
with plants is something that I'm not quite ready to think is possible. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But hopefully, this latest post is worth starting a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; new discussion on forms of communication with psychologies very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different from ours. Is it even possible/meaningful?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, communicating with non-humans is awfully USEful. What good would a dog
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be if you couldn't communicate with it? Not good for much of anything but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eating, huh?  And I don't even like to eat dogs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Heh. I've never had dog either. Never had the opportunity. Yes, I
<BR>
absolutely agree it is useful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What do you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are the factors involved? How would you go about replicating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; feelings of connection with the coyote?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I reckon I'd just go on out in the woods and start communicating with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone or other.  I'll tell you, though, coyotes are usually pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; standoffish.  It's not like they'll just come around any old time and chew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the fat with you. Now the javelinas, they're much more sociable.  Only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble is, if you commit a faux pas they're likely to rip you to shreds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with their razor-sharp canines.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I'll keep that in mind. =)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Seriously though, when I talk/write with someone, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't view it as adversarial.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's good to know. For some reason, your messages came across as though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you were, well, poking fun of me for being just a simple country gal;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially when you use all those fancy Latin words like &quot;canine&quot; instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just saying &quot;dog&quot;.  But sometimes us simple country folks know a thing or 2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about animals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
My apologies. It was never my intent. I hardly think you are &quot;simple&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>Canine is Latin? Hrmph. Learn something new everyday.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  If you'd rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have an &quot;argument&quot; I'll oblige, but I'd rather not if it's all the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I'd rather not have an argument either.  Now that's something that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to interfere with communication, isn't it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Not in the least. For me, that is. But, perhaps that went without
<BR>
saying. =)
