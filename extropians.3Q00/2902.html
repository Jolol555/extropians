<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; &gt; Its pretty well standard, perhaps some of the lawyers like Greg can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; contribute.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe, but this is a very minor side issue... I wouldn't expect much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I know of a case,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael!  First a hypothetical situation with a flawed conclusion, then a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sweeping generalized argument from authority and now anecdotal evidence?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I could play battling anecdotes with you, but it wouldn't prove anything.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You still haven't actually answered my first two objections.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A) You are responsible for your own actions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; B) Do the research if you are going to make an &quot;argument from authority&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a weak argument in any case... but you don't get to make stuff up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That isn't how reasoned discourse works.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK here are some cases:
<BR>
State ex rel Graham v. Cherry, No.
<BR>
&nbsp;M1999-01623-COA-R3-CV (Tennessee Court of Appeals, July 19,
<BR>
2000): Upon the determination of paternity, the father of a child
<BR>
born out of wedlock is statutorily liable for support from and after
<BR>
the child's birth. Further, the juvenile court has the discretion to
<BR>
order a retroactive support award back to that date, the amount
<BR>
and method of payment to be determined by the juvenile judge in
<BR>
light of the circumstances of the case and consistent with the
<BR>
standards which normally govern the issuance of child support
<BR>
orders. T.C.A. § 36-2-108(d). The father's liability is not
<BR>
retroactive only to the date on which he knew for certain that he
<BR>
was the child's father.
<BR>
<P>And what should make this an open and shut issue, read the following
<BR>
page:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.supportguidelines.com/articles/art199903.html">http://www.supportguidelines.com/articles/art199903.html</A>
<BR>
where:
<BR>
The lesson one must take from S.F. v. T.M., however, is somewhat
<BR>
troubling: a man is strictly liable for where his sperm  ends up even
<BR>
when he unknowingly and involuntarily engages in a
<BR>
sexual act. Instead of comparing the father's predicament with the
<BR>
mother's predicament in Division of Child Support Enforcement ex
<BR>
rel. Esther M. v. Mary L., No. 94-33812 (1994.DE.19031), where a
<BR>
mother was relieved of her child support obligation because she
<BR>
was raped, the court imposed a child support obligation because of
<BR>
the fact of paternity. This can only be termed a strict liability
<BR>
theory of sperm.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, taking the example of artificial insemination, we see
<BR>
that so long as the strictures of the UNIFORM STATUS OF CHILDREN OF
<BR>
ASSISTED CONCEPTION ACT
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/fnact99/uscaca88.htm">http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/fnact99/uscaca88.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>which still says this about the parental status of consenting donors:
<BR>
&lt;&lt;Present statutory law is split concerning the parental status of sperm
<BR>
donors. Fifteen states have statutes, patterned after Section 5(b) of
<BR>
the Uniform Parentage Act,
<BR>
specifying that a donor will not be considered the father of a child
<BR>
born of artificial insemination if the semen was provided to a licensed
<BR>
physician for use in artificial
<BR>
insemination of a married woman other than the donor's wife. Fifteen
<BR>
other statutes do not explicitly limit nonparenthood to situations where
<BR>
the semen is provided to
<BR>
a physician. Instead, they shield donors from parenthood in all
<BR>
situations where a married woman is artificially inseminated with her
<BR>
husband's consent. &gt;&gt; (i.e. if the husband does not give his consent (or
<BR>
rescinds his consent any time in the two years following the act of
<BR>
insemination) then the donor, known or anonymous, is considered a
<BR>
parent.
<BR>
<P>This is definitely a very grey area, however once cloning becomes
<BR>
popular, I think that there will be some more definitive case law about
<BR>
this particular issue, as women take the hair from a persons brush and
<BR>
clones them without knowledge or consent...

the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
