<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Franklin Poley
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not know if this is of interest to you, but in Sweden there is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; experimental farm for rainbow trout. The fish feces are used to fertilize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the soil in big greenhouses growning tomatoes and cucumber. The greenhouses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; also clean the water in the fish tanks (closed system).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure if anything is written about this in English. Per-Erik (Pekka)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nygard is responsible for the experiment which is located in Harnosand,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sweden.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This sort of system dates back to the maya, had maize paddys surrounded by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; canals inhabited by fish and a sort of watercress. Hand dredging the canals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brought up loam for the paddys, and harvesting the watercress/lillypad growths
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provided green vegetable matter and fiber, with protein from the fish .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'Sustainable agriculture' is nothing really new, its merely a marketing ploy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; con people into paying more for their food.
</EM><BR>
<P>True but I think the integration of some very old natural
<BR>
aquaculture/agriculture methods with high technology has promise. I had an
<BR>
acreage and a part-time farm for 10 years. I met some full time greenhouse
<BR>
growers who were among the first businesses here to make optimal use of
<BR>
computers. At the same time they used specially bred predator mites to
<BR>
kill spider mites (very 'organic' and low-tech). Thus in planning the
<BR>
False Creek Model Sustainable Village in Vancouver (5,000 people/shoreline
<BR>
site) I can visualize such a project with integrated greenhouses and
<BR>
closed containment fish farming and little or no pollution from the
<BR>
industry while it is still very profitable. And I wonder how far one could
<BR>
go with automating such a complex.
