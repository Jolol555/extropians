<EM>&gt; Even if there is no direct pressure for truth, there may be indirect

<EM>&gt; pressures.  It all depends on what exactly the evolutionary function of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness is.  It is obviously something social, and I alluded to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a &quot;PR&quot; model, but that's still pretty vague.  Even PR departments tell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the truth sometimes.
</EM><BR>
<P>When you speak of a &quot;PR&quot; model, do you mean that consciousness exists
<BR>
(or appears to exist) primarily for the benefit of other people, rather
<BR>
than for yourself?  That is pretty much the case with PR departments.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps you are conscious in order to make you appear to be more
<BR>
predictable and therefore reliable?  Would consciousness do this, though,
<BR>
if it does not actually affect decision making?
<BR>
<P>I'd be curious to hear more about what you mean...
