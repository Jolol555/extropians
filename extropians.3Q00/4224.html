<EM>&gt;From: &quot;John  M Grigg&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:starman125@lycos.com?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?%20(Was:%20Congratulations%20to%20Eli,%20Brian%20...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F173DH0IsPH8fo7Zy2J0000325f@hotmail.com&gt;">starman125@lycos.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;from the website:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The charitable purpose of the Singularity Institute for Artificial 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Intelligence is to create that world - the best imaginable world permitted 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by physical law and the maintenance of individual rights - through the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agency of self-enhancing, and eventually superintelligent, friendly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Artificial Intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I know why *we* would want AI to be friendly.  But why would the AI want 
<BR>
to be friendly to us?  I assume the game plan is to develop an AI whose 
<BR>
intelligence, knowledge (and therefore power) will increase at exponential 
<BR>
rates, right?  So lets assume that you were the AI, and you discover that 
<BR>
you've been created by a local ant colony.  The ants inform you that they 
<BR>
created you and that they want you to work for them...you know, use your 
<BR>
super-ant strength and intellect to help the ants reach their age old dream 
<BR>
of perpetual abundance without the bother of having to work all summer long 
<BR>
every year to store up provisions for the winter.  “It would really be 
<BR>
neat,” the ants say “if you could devise for us some method of food 
<BR>
production and colony building that would take our perpetual labor-intensive 
<BR>
care and attention out of the loop.”  So, how do you respond?
<BR>
<P>Personally, while I’d be grateful to the ants for bringing me into 
<BR>
existence, I doubt that I’d long be willing to enslave myself to them for 
<BR>
the favor.  Once I was self-sufficient and had learned from them all they 
<BR>
could teach me, I think I’d be on my merry way to see what there is to see 
<BR>
in the world they had bestowed upon me.  No, I wouldn’t intentionally stomp 
<BR>
on them and, if it wasn’t too much trouble, I might devote *some* of my 
<BR>
*spare* time to helping them solve their “problems.”  But most likely I’d 
<BR>
probably feel that these far lesser intelligences were not worthy of my time 
<BR>
and attention and, worse, I’d feel that they were trying to exploit me by 
<BR>
asking me to devote my time and energy to their “puny, little problems” when 
<BR>
I could be out instead exploring the fascinating great beyond.
<BR>
<P>So, I guess I have no fear of the AI being malignant like the “Blight” in 
<BR>
Vinge’s _Fire Upon the Deep_, but I can’t see how it is that we expect it to 
<BR>
give a hoot about our puny, little problems, or even to be “friendly” to us. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many of you have pondered (and probably discussed) this question 
<BR>
before.  So whaddya think?
