From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20Re%20GM%20angst&In-Reply-To=&lt;200007201914.MAA22528@well.com&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; The problem is that the science the GM industry is doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;involves me as the unwitting lab rat, a part I am loath to play.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yet you, and no one else, for that matter, seems to object to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being 'lab rats' when new breeds of plants are developed by time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;honored processes of human directed hybridization. The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;difference between GM foods and those developed by the hit or miss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;methods of the past is that GM is focused, informed, and directed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Come on Mike the two processes are hardly similiar. Hybridization
<BR>
of existing SPECIES is a completely different thing from the kind
<BR>
of trangenetic manipulation possible with modern biotech.
<BR>
<P>I'm not a poster boy for those who don't understand the basics, I'm
<BR>
arguing that there is a big difference between producing things
<BR>
which have enhanced nutritional value, and those that merely have
<BR>
enhanced economic value for a specific company.
<BR>
<P>Of course a good product would automatically have both. 
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; They can start to promote the &quot;calming down&quot; by halting their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; opposition to labeling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; It's clear the industry is unwilling to face the facts.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As if the ignorant people who irrationally fear GM foods even once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;face the facts.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ignorant or not it's clear many people don't want these products.
<BR>
The industry knows this which is why they oppose labeling, playing
<BR>
the &quot;we know best&quot; crap. It is this attitude many people (including
<BR>
me) oppose. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; The historical evidence is seen daily in newspaper headlines,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;even when companies know about bad things their products do, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;either ignore it, or hide it.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Which is why there is the FDA process. Most of what I've ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;heard that are the 'bad' things these products do is bogus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unfounded hysteria based on fake science by people with an agenda.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not arguing what anybody else said.
<BR>
<P>We've been historically through the &quot;this pesticide/herbicide is
<BR>
perfectly harmless&quot; routine before. The first thing that happens is
<BR>
people start using it in quantities that pose problems with
<BR>
agricultural runoff.
<BR>
<P>I'm not even arguing that these things are bad, I just want them
<BR>
labeled so people can choose.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the ultimate telling point is that the industry wants to
<BR>
try changing the name from GMO to something else. 
<BR>
<P>I call that sneaky, deceptive and dishonest.
