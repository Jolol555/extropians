<EM>&gt;  &gt; In further support of your comments, I'd add that the &quot;off switch&quot; for an AI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; could actually terminate or delete it. This means that it would be *much* easier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; to control unruly AIs than to control human children, since we (unfortunately?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; can't actually terminate recalcitrant or sociopathic (i.e., unfriendly) human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I like children, but sometimes watching a sick (and cranky) 1.5 year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old for 5 hours straight did make me sometimes wish for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspend/resume button.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Children are surprisingly efficient disruptors of mental processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (well, perhaps less surprising, since being information vampires). It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is perhaps not so hard for parents, who are flooded with endogenous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; euphorica, since smitten with their offspring, but that couple did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complain a bit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In absence of suspend/resume, are there any kid rentals out there? ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats what neices and nephews are for (or aunts and uncles). I love to hang out
<BR>
with my nephew, and he knows he can't pull the kind of crap with me he normally
<BR>
gets away with elsewhere. When he puts on one of his acts (pouting, screaming,
<BR>
crying, whining) I applaud and cheer mightily, complimenting him on his
<BR>
performance, that I almost even believed him for a second. I then go into a
<BR>
'Oscar night' speech (&quot;I'd like to thank my director, my agent, etc....&quot;) if
<BR>
warranted. If he falls, I'll help him up, but if he looks at me on the verge of
<BR>
tears, I say, 'you're alright', and he doesn't go into the little dramatization
<BR>
that he typically uses to get attention from his mother...
