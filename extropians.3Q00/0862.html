<P>Carnosine - Novel strategies to prevent the formation of Advanced Glycation 
<BR>
End Products using Carnosine and Carnosine Stabilizers
<BR>
<P><P>Background
<BR>
Carnosine, the dipeptide beta-alanalyl-L-histidine, is a naturally occurring 
<BR>
molecule, found at levels as high as 20 mM in skeletal muscle and 5 mM in 
<BR>
the brain. These high levels appear to be due to resistance of carnosine to 
<BR>
proteolytic cleavage and low activity of specific carnosinases.
<BR>
The biological role of carnosine remains unclear, but homeostatic or 
<BR>
protective functions have been proposed. Carnosine is believed to decrease 
<BR>
oxygen free radical-mediated damage to cellular macromolecules either by 
<BR>
chelating divalent cations, or by scavenging hydroxyl radicals through its 
<BR>
imidazole moiety.
<BR>
Peptech scientists and their collaborators have discovered additional 
<BR>
activities of carnosine that suggest it may have considerable therapeutic 
<BR>
potential in reducing or preventing some age-related degenerative 
<BR>
conditions.
<BR>
Carnosine inhibits reactions related to ageing in the skin
<BR>
Maintenance of the skin requires continual proliferation of fibroblasts and 
<BR>
production of new collagen. Modelling of this process in cell culture 
<BR>
systems shows that human fibroblasts have limited proliferative capacity. 
<BR>
Cells taken from aged individuals have lower capacity for further new growth 
<BR>
than do cells taken from the young. Peptech scientists and their 
<BR>
collaborators have shown that in such model systems, carnosine is able to 
<BR>
prolong the lifespan potential of skin fibroblasts, and to revitalise cells 
<BR>
which are already well advanced towards senescence.
<BR>
These results suggest the potential use of carnosine in improving wound 
<BR>
healing, particularly in the elderly.
<BR>
An unexpected property for carnosine - inhibition of the formation of 
<BR>
advanced glycosylation end product proteins
<BR>
Non-enzymatic glycosylation (glycation), the Maillard reaction in food 
<BR>
chemistry, involves reaction of amino groups with sugar aldehyde or keto 
<BR>
groups to produce reactive chemical entities. These provoke cross-linking, 
<BR>
with eventual formation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGE). 
<BR>
Although glycation is slow in vivo, it is of fundamental importance in 
<BR>
ageing and in pathological conditions where sugar levels are elevated, eg in 
<BR>
diabetes, and can result in abnormalities of connective tissue, for example 
<BR>
cross-linking of collagen.
<BR>
Analysis of the preferred glycation sites in proteins shows that the epsilon 
<BR>
amino groups of lysine residues are primary targets, particularly when in 
<BR>
proximity to histidine residues. This preferred sequence closely resembles 
<BR>
that of carnosine.
<BR>
In in vitro tests, Peptech scientists have shown that carnosine can readily 
<BR>
react with sugars such as glucose, galactose and dihydroxy acetone (DHA) to 
<BR>
produce brown solutions characteristic of glycation as originally described 
<BR>
by Maillard. The reactive rate of carnosine with sugars was determined by 
<BR>
disappearance of free amino groups (measured fluorimetrically after HPLC). 
<BR>
Of the three sugars tested, DHA was the most reactive.
<BR>
Carnosine reacted with DHA faster than did lysine, suggesting that the 
<BR>
dipeptide could compete against other sources of amino groups for glycation. 
<BR>
Variants of the dipeptide were tested in glycation reactions and it was 
<BR>
found that minor structural changes to carnosine (eg the addition of a 
<BR>
methylene group) reduced its reactivity. In addition, carnosine strongly 
<BR>
inhibited glycation of the dipeptide Ac-Lys-His-NH2 by DHA. Since this 
<BR>
latter sequence resembles the preferred glycation site in proteins, it 
<BR>
indicates that carnosine may be able to block glycation of proteins.
<BR>
Further investigation showed that carnosine was able to inhibit the 
<BR>
cross-linking of bovine serum albumin resulting from glycation of the 
<BR>
protein by DHA. All in vitro results were observed at relatively high levels 
<BR>
of carnosine (60-250 mM), of the same order as the concentration of sugars 
<BR>
(0.2-2 M) or protein amino groups present in the reaction mixtures. This is 
<BR>
consistent with a mechanism for carnosine action whereby it acts as a 
<BR>
competitive acceptor in the glycation reaction. Thus the concentration of 
<BR>
carnosine required to inhibit protein damage in vivo should be dependent on 
<BR>
the levels of reactive sugars being generated.
<BR>
Properties of glycated carnosine
<BR>
Glycated amino acids such as lysine and arginine have been reported to be 
<BR>
mutagenic in the Ames test. Other glycated amino acids such as proline and 
<BR>
cysteine do not exhibit mutagenicity. Peptech scientists investigated the 
<BR>
mutagenicity of L-carnosine, and the glycated forms of L-carnosine, L-lysine 
<BR>
and L-alanine, by Ames testing. As expected from published work, 
<BR>
mutagenicity was recorded for L-lysine but not for L-alanine. Neither 
<BR>
L-carnosine nor glycated carnosine were mutagenic.
<BR>
Therapeutic significance of glycation inhibition
<BR>
It is believed that AGE product formation is of particular significance in 
<BR>
diabetes, where levels of blood glucose are periodically elevated. AGE's are 
<BR>
strongly implicated in development of degenerative changes including 
<BR>
cataract formation and atherosclerosis.
<BR>
Carnosine, administered to animals in their drinking water, has been 
<BR>
demonstrated by Peptech scientists to reduce the occurrence of 
<BR>
AGE-associated degenerative changes. Taken over eight weeks, carnosine 
<BR>
reduced changes associated with cataract formation in the eyes of rats in 
<BR>
which diabetes was induced by treatment with streptozotocin. Further, 
<BR>
carnosine reduced the extent of artherosclerotic plaque formation over eight 
<BR>
weeks in rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet. Carnosine showed activity 
<BR>
equivalent to that of the known glycation inhibitor, aminoguanidine. These 
<BR>
experiments are of a preliminary nature only, and more extended periods of 
<BR>
treatment will be needed to fully assess carnosine's efficacy in reducing 
<BR>
the occurrence of these degenerative conditions.
<BR>
Strategies to modify carnosine metabolism
<BR>
Another approach undertaken by Peptech scientists has been to modify the 
<BR>
metabolism of carnosine in our effort to increase its half-life in serum and 
<BR>
thus extend its activity. A screening program has isolated several promising 
<BR>
lead compounds which significantly improve the stability of carnosine in 
<BR>
vitro.
<BR>
Further testing will be required to determine the efficacy of these 
<BR>
compounds in vivo.
<BR>
Conclusions
<BR>
Peptech scientists and their associates have demonstrated that the naturally 
<BR>
occurring dipeptide carnosine is able to directly block protein damage 
<BR>
resulting from AGE formation. In its effects, carnosine is equipotent with 
<BR>
aminoguanidine, the only well-documented glycation inhibitor. However, 
<BR>
carnosine intervenes at an earlier step in the glycation process than 
<BR>
aminoguanidine and effectively diverts the reaction to production of 
<BR>
non-damaging and rapidly cleared products. Carnosine is a natural product 
<BR>
and, unlike aminoguanidine, has extremely low toxicity. Despite its peptide 
<BR>
nature, it is fully effective following oral administration.
<BR>
In future work, extended animal trials to demonstrate efficacy for carnosine 
<BR>
in appropriate models of diabetes-associated degenerative changes are 
<BR>
required. Carnosine, and closely related molecules with similar properties, 
<BR>
represent an exciting new entry to the treatment of age-related degenerative 
<BR>
responses, particularly in groups of patients, such as diabetics, where 
<BR>
these degenerative processes may be accelerated. Peptech is using its 
<BR>
findings on carnosine as a starting point for design of improved molecules 
<BR>
to act as antiglycating agents in vivo.
