<EM>&gt;     &gt; I think the problem with this specific scenario is that the modified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; cold virus would kill the host before becoming infective enough to spread
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; itself widely.  Colds make people emit a lot of mucus, sneeze and cough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; to spread themselves, but it takes a while for this to happen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The symptoms of Ebola are massive systemic hemorrhaging in all the tissues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the body including the lungs. Infected blood pours out of every body orifice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even from the eyes and ears and around the fingernails. However to get Ebola you'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to actually touch the blood, but if the virus were airborn like the common cold ....
</EM><BR>
<P>That is a question of mechanics. Does the hemmorhaging flood the lungs too much
<BR>
to allow the victim to have any breath to cough and sneeze?? Since its the big
<BR>
sneeze that really propells the virus out, at up to 100 mph, you would need to
<BR>
have a diaphragm musculature that is still intact and able to provide that sort
<BR>
of force. If the virus is flooded by blood, and the diaphragm muscle is weakened
<BR>
from undergoing the process of being turned to jelly, then you likely would not
<BR>
see much spread via atmosphere, although contact transmission would likely be
<BR>
highly effective, considering the amount of time the cold requires for
<BR>
incubation, a carrier with the virus 'in hand' could be spreading the virus to
<BR>
any phone, table, counter, desk, bed, or other surface they come in contact
<BR>
with. You'd likely have some cases of infected families being torched in their
<BR>
homes by neighbors, but I doubt this virus would be as communicable by the air
<BR>
as the cold is.
