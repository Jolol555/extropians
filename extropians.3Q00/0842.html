<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I came up with this idea several years ago but just realized it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propogandistic value today: genetically engineer a strain of grass 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (common lawn grass) which produces THC, and other chemicals found in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marijuana. Immediately, many of the people (from the left side of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-GM spectrum) who are now protesting GM food suddenly can grow their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favorite drug, right in their front lawn, without arousing detection. The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument against hemp is that it will make it easier to grow marijuana - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the argument applies here as well, to a much higher degree.. everyone has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lawn. How easy would it be to select a corner of it specifically for GM 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grass, nobody would ever suspect - prohibition would completely crumble. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could this be done? Is it as easy as inserting a single gene as has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already been done in hundreds of other cases?
</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno, maybe you'd have to include some of the (many) other chemicals 
<BR>
that are found in MJ as well for an optimal effect. The idea certainly has 
<BR>
potential. If you use a sturdy, &quot;aggressive&quot; type of grass this thing could 
<BR>
spread like wildfire. Of course there would be some side-effects like 
<BR>
perpetually stoned cows etc., but that's a small price to pay for what 
<BR>
could be a major victory for the good guys in the war against the war on 
<BR>
drugs. The govs of the world would no doubt try to wipe out the happy 
<BR>
grass, first with &quot;conventional&quot; means and later with some GM weapon(s) of 
<BR>
their own, but the grass could be adapted as well so you'd get something of 
<BR>
a GM arms race/guerilla warfare.
<BR>
<P>On a related note, you could presumably engineer a virus that's as 
<BR>
contagious as the flu (or worse), but which only &quot;attacks&quot; the brain's 
<BR>
pleasure centers and produces an XTC-esque effect, i.e. a &quot;love virus&quot;. You 
<BR>
could either make it last for only a week or so, like the &quot;normal&quot; flu, or 
<BR>
(and this is probably a lot more difficult and risky) make the effects more 
<BR>
or less permanent, like chronic fatigue syndrome (chronic feelgood 
<BR>
syndrome). Because infected parties would be inclined to get intimate with 
<BR>
anyone and everyone, the virus should spread extra fast. In fact, this 
<BR>
would probably be such an effective reproductive strategy that I'm somewhat 
<BR>
puzzled that (afaik) no &quot;natural&quot; viruses work this way; making their hosts 
<BR>
feel sick and miserable, let alone *killing* them, is rather stupid from 
<BR>
the virus'/bacterium's point of view.
<BR>
<P>It's not all fun and games, of course; if the effects were strong enough, 
<BR>
you could use the virus as a means to paralyze or even take over countries 
<BR>
etc. A more vicious variant could be used to turn people into &quot;zombies&quot;, 
<BR>
paranoid cowards or hyper-aggressive maniacs. L.A. riots^10 on a global 
<BR>
scale. Or what about a virus that attacks the optic nerves and makes people 
<BR>
blind - that would pretty much make them sitting ducks as shown in _The Day 
<BR>
of the Triffids _(<A HREF="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue73/classic.html">http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue73/classic.html</A>). Or a 
<BR>
combination of the above (first a mating-frenzy to spread the virus, then 
<BR>
aggression/ blindness etc.) Excellent terrorist weapons... who needs 
<BR>
nanotech to f*ck up civilization?
<BR>
<P>BTW: I saw a movie once (some 70's production, don't know the name etc.) 
<BR>
where a guy developed a &quot;parasite&quot; (big disgusting snail-like thing) which 
<BR>
caused its host to display wild mating behavior. There were some nasty 
<BR>
(lethal) side-effects though, mainly due to the fact that those things 
<BR>
multiplied in one's stomach, _Alien_-style. A virus would definitely have 
<BR>
been a more user-frienly choice. Anyway, they spread and presumably the 
<BR>
world went to Hell. Fun movie, though.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This would probably backfire if done in isolation without anything else to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appease the religious right wing &quot;you're playing god!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;I'm not playing god, I AM God&quot;. Maybe something for a t-shirt...
