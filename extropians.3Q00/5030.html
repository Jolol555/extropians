<P>t what you are advocating is clearly the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; murder the most defenseless members of society.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>BL:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You're doing the same when you kill a fetus.  Why kid yourself and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pretend that you're not?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Because there is a distinct legal distinction involved. As I've 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; posted here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before, citizenship is recognised as being conferred at birth. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true, but it's not a satisfying distinction at a time when 3
<BR>
month fetuses can be removed from the mother's womb and grown on in an
<BR>
incubator.  And there are other circumstances where it may be desirable
<BR>
to have a clearer definition of human life, or a clearer concept of how
<BR>
it's to be dealt with.   How about when the time comes that a microscopic
<BR>
embryo can be grown to term in an artificial womb?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The unborn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not citizens, and have no rights.
</EM><BR>
<P>Desptie the rhetoric of the &quot;Pro-lifers&quot;, I  think the real issue here
<BR>
isn't the rights of the unborn, but rather the rights of the mother. 
<BR>
And, as ZP pointed out, the rights of the father as well, since the
<BR>
father can be forced to support a child once it's born--and once embryos
<BR>
can be grown to term in artificial wombs, I'd argue that the father has
<BR>
as much right as the mother to decide the fate of the embryo.  Until
<BR>
artificial wombs are perfected, I think the decision to HAVE a child must
<BR>
rest with the mother alone; to decide otherwise would be to decide in
<BR>
favor of slavery.   That is to say, at this point in time, the decision
<BR>
whether or not to bear a child should be the mother's, but the father
<BR>
should have the right to veto a decision in favor of bearing the child. 
<BR>
This raises further questions, such as whether the mother should have the
<BR>
right to override the father's veto if she agrees to waive rights to
<BR>
paternal support for the child.
