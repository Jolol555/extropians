<EM>&gt; If the pilgrims has been &quot;ants&quot;, I don't think King George

<EM>&gt; the colonies.  (Insert cartoon of King George stepping on an

<P>Sorry to take this out of context, but I just had a thought.
<BR>
<P>You know that we don't dominate ants. We dominate all kinds of other
<BR>
animals, lots of our ecosystem. But ants are doing pretty well, often
<BR>
despite our best efforts; this expands into most of the insect world.
<BR>
<P>Is it really as clear cut as we often make out that SIs would entirely
<BR>
dominate sub-SIs? Or is there some room for competition, based on different
<BR>
requirements? For instance, perhaps those SIs will require so much energy to
<BR>
operate, that there can't be many of them, and they can't really afford the
<BR>
effort required to stomp out all those pesky human-nests. Thoughts?
