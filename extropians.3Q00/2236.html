<EM>&gt; I'm in the middle of doing some research for some papers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been glancing through &quot;Entering Space&quot; by Robert Zubrin.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (As you may remember, I gave his &quot;Case for Mars&quot; a hearty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thumbs up.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm only skimming chapters, but extracts include:

<EM>&gt; Re: Nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;This could lead to the manifestation of systems that would have all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the capabilities of the evil &quot;liquid metal&quot; robot depicted in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; movie Terminator 2, ...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
snip...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All of Zubrin's subsequent discussion of dismantling Venus to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; construct a Ringworld or building masses of O'Neill colonies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is irrelevant because it assumes Dyson shells are impossible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, it would appear that Zubrin's perspective argues that only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;humans&quot; in their natural form will be the logical explorers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the solar system.
</EM><BR>
<P>I presume that one of Zubrins frustrations with the 'nano-santa' premise
<BR>
is that it breeds an atmosphere of complacency, where anything hard to
<BR>
do now in space will be put off until the nanites can do it for us. Such
<BR>
an attitude can derail and end manned exploration once and for all, for
<BR>
starters. What this attitude will lead to in the future as well is for
<BR>
it to devolve from acceptance of using robot probes, to merely
<BR>
acceptance of remote observation by telescope, as people get more fat
<BR>
and happy on their couches.
