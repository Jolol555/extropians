<P>&lt;&lt; Maybe we can get by without higher-dimensional waves (or branes, whatever),
<BR>
&nbsp;or maybe that's just the kind of world we're in so we use what we can get
<BR>
&nbsp;our hands on. Either way, I don't know how to make that final unzipping
<BR>
&nbsp;occur. Run the code-string into solar plasma vortices? Into a planetary van
<BR>
&nbsp;Allen belt? Into the accretion disk of a black hole? All these have been
<BR>
&nbsp;suggested in fiction as habitats for smart signal resonances. I'm wondering
<BR>
&nbsp;if anyone here can come up with better proposals.

Certainly several physicists have reflected on this &quot;unzipping&quot; capability as 
<BR>
a way to resolve Stephen Hawkings hypothesis that information is utterly 
<BR>
destroyed when it is ultimately gathered up into cosmic black holes. The 
<BR>
physicists in question, tended to see Hawkings postulate as being a-causal; 
<BR>
and have re-worked his analysis to not destroy information, but to contain it 
<BR>
holographically around the horizon-wall of a blackhole, using our 
<BR>
understanding of M-brane theory. Rucker's book was great, yet it relied on 
<BR>
electro-magnetism as a basis, and EM gets over-whelmed by gravity. M-Brane + 
<BR>
general relativity gets us further along the axis of knowledge, I suspect.
