<P>They do wacky things like this in the military.  They mighta been
<BR>
looking for a curtain that the sailors could wrap around themselves
<BR>
and use to escape a fire or something.  You wouldn't want to try
<BR>
that with the commercial variety.
<BR>
<P>The reason I tend to be jaded about the scandals is twofold.  First,
<BR>
the military does use commercial grade equipment wherever it can,
<BR>
in fact they buy it in such quantity they get terrific deals.
<BR>
<P>Secondly I am reminded of an incident that occurred to me shortly
<BR>
after I got outta college.  A shipment of sidewinder wings were delivered
<BR>
to the Navy that had one dimension slightly out of tolerance.  The base
<BR>
of the wing is about 1.7 inches across, and most of that shipment were
<BR>
about .004 inches too narrow at the base.  The wings cost about a
<BR>
thousand dollars each, and there were 400 of them in the shipment.
<BR>
<P>Legally, the Navy could have shipped them back and made the contractor
<BR>
eat the cost, but in fact there was no reason why the discrepant wings
<BR>
couldnt be used, and no one could think of any reason why the tolerance
<BR>
couldnt be lowered a bit.  Just in case, they gave me a few of the wings
<BR>
and asked me to put them thru a series of tests.  The wings attached
<BR>
using eight screws which had a nyloc patch.  I figured I would simulate
<BR>
the wear on the nyloc by chucking the screws in a drill and running
<BR>
them in and out of a hole 50 times, which is way more strenuous
<BR>
than the worst the sailors would dish out.  I then attached the wings
<BR>
with the pre-worn screws and put them thru every test I could think
<BR>
of, vibration, thermal shock, high temperature soak, low temp, everything,
<BR>
and the wings performed just fine, no different than the compliant wings.
<BR>
So, the Navy lowered the tolerance 5 thousanths and accepted the
<BR>
lot, made Raytheon pay for the test series, about  3k$ as opposed to
<BR>
420k.  Case closed.  Or so we thought.
<BR>
<P>A certain Washington political columnist, Jack Anderson, got wind
<BR>
of the incident and wrote a scathing article on how the big wasteful
<BR>
government was using its resources to bail out the big wasteful
<BR>
defense contractor, and so on, a ton of bullshit.  To make a long
<BR>
story a scandal, Jack pretty much invented a coverup story where
<BR>
none really existed.
<BR>
<P>I see it as a holdover from the Watergate days: Woodward and
<BR>
Bernstein became the hero of every young reporter.  Now every
<BR>
young reporter wants so badly to uncover a government scandal
<BR>
that they are willing to invent one.  I see newspapers more and
<BR>
more try to spin the news, not just report the news.  The famous
<BR>
$x00 hammer is a great example, the meme that will not die.  Our
<BR>
government has plenty of actual scandals, they need not make
<BR>
them up where they dont exist.   spike
