<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Are animals as legitimate an artform as orchids and rainbow corn?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would question &quot;orchids and rainbow corn&quot; as forms of art.  What seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be lost in this question is the distinction between [fine] art and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; decoration.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Where are the ethical boundaries?  What are the ethical
</EM><BR>
considerations?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; What would you create?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I have concerns about using any conscious life form -- which I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rabbits are -- for such experiments, especially in this case where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; benefit is pure entertainment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the bunny is a very good idea, and counts as art.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good ideas are not equivalent to fine art.  Double entry bookkeeping was a
<BR>
good idea when it first arose, yet it is not a fine art.  Important
<BR>
distinctions are being blurred here, again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That artist is attempting to bring the issues of genetic modification to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fore. He's saying This is really happening. Right now. Look, a glowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bunny. Deal with it.
</EM><BR>
<P>The person is attempting to do that, but that does not make it art.  If I
<BR>
storm into a town council and make the people there deal with me, this is
<BR>
not art.  It might raise consciousness, get me in the newspaper, and change
<BR>
peoples' minds, but it is not art.
<BR>
<P>If you define art as stuff that makes people change their minds or forces
<BR>
them to deal with issues, then there is no way to distinguish art from
<BR>
non-art and the term becomes meaningless.  A death in the family forces
<BR>
people to deal with issues.  Is it art too?  Being mugged will change lots
<BR>
of people.  Is mugging an art form?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All sorts of extra concepts come with this. Like, for instance, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediately imagines GM pets in general. It can happen right now. Deal
</EM><BR>
with
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And, for a frankenstein bunny, it's pretty cute. It's got a positive
</EM><BR>
aspect;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the bunny isn't a malformed monster which will devour the world, it's a
</EM><BR>
cute
<BR>
<EM>&gt; little regular bunny which happens to be phosporescent (yowsa). So there
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; some comment about genetic modification not being automatically evil. Just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it can't occur &quot;naturally&quot;, doesn't mean it is bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>My ethical point was to question whether such experiments should be done on
<BR>
conscious beings.  I've not against genetic engineering per se.  This does
<BR>
not mean, however, anything goes.  I'm not for, and I doubt many on this
<BR>
list are for, kidnapping people and using them genetic experiments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So yes, I think this has been entirely justifiable as a form of art. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever, the ethical boundaries are something like, yes, you can do this for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; art, but it's got to be good art. There's the problem...
</EM><BR>
<P>The two issues are separate.  Something can be art or not and something can
<BR>
be ethical or not.  That something is not art does not mean it is not
<BR>
ethical and vice versa.  And also that something is art does not mean it is
<BR>
ethical and vice versa.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
