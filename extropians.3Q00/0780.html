</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They may BE chemical triggers, but never for one minute do I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;nothing but&quot; brain cocktails. They are the product of a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complex set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tasks and responses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For one thing, creativity plays a higher role it in than you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowing for.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There's a big difference between true/thought-centered love &amp; sex, though.
<BR>
I'm not sure they have much to do with each other outside of cultural taboos
<BR>
(isn't there a line in the New Testament part of the Bible where Paul tells
<BR>
people that the very best thing to be is celibate, but if one MUST break
<BR>
their celibacy, at least let it be with a wife--he was addressing men, as I
<BR>
recall).  Within the trust/friendship/shared experience structure of a
<BR>
true-love relationship, sex is only one of many pleasures to be mutually
<BR>
enjoyed.
<BR>
<P>But raw, urgent sex is something else again, and this is why my in my ideal
<BR>
society prostitution would be a respected profession. Speaking of
<BR>
prostitution, I had an interesting experience once.
<BR>
<P>I used to have a law/CPA practice serving small businesses.  Occassionally
<BR>
there were exciting moments when IRS officers would show up unexpectedly at
<BR>
someone's business, throw everyone out, and lock the doors.  But usually,
<BR>
the practice was intellectually stimulating along the lines of a chess game
<BR>
rather than gut-level exciting.  Feeling bored one day, my staff and I
<BR>
decided to liven things up a bit by starting a computer dating service,
<BR>
which we would run out of the law office by setting appointments for law
<BR>
clients and dating service clients at different times of the day. We figured
<BR>
it would take a little while to build up our clientele, so we decided to
<BR>
begin advertising the dating service even as I was still working on a
<BR>
computer program that would sort and match clients' preferences.
<BR>
<P>We placed the following ad (duplicated to the best of my memory) in the
<BR>
Sunday edition of the city's main newspaper: &quot;Looking for friendship,
<BR>
romance, or just a good time?  Dream Makers...&quot; We used one of our secondary
<BR>
phone numbers rather than the main office phone number, so that the
<BR>
receptionist would know whether to answer the phone &quot;Law Office&quot; or &quot;Dream
<BR>
Makers.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Monday after the ad ran, the Dream Makers line started ringing early in
<BR>
the morning. At first the receptionist took names and numbers, intending to
<BR>
get back to people once the computer program was up and running.  But within
<BR>
the hour it was evident that we had screwed up big-time in the way we worded
<BR>
the ad.  We had so many calls for Dream Makers that it tied up all three of
<BR>
our phone lines.  At one point, a telephone repairman came into the office.
<BR>
&quot;Hey,&quot; he said, &quot;I heard you were having some phone problems...and...by the
<BR>
way, what's this Dream Maker thing?  I think I want to sign up.&quot;  Out of all
<BR>
these hundreds of calls, all were men except for ONE!
<BR>
<P>My secretary's husband said that the way we worded the ad made it sound like
<BR>
a prostitution service.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that at least one of the
<BR>
calls we got was from the police checking things out.
<BR>
<P>That was the end of our dating service.  True, we could have tried rewording
<BR>
the ad (and maybe picking a different name for the service), and in
<BR>
retrospect I wish we had done so.  It would have been interesting to see
<BR>
what sort of ad got the right mix of male and female respondents. One thing
<BR>
was clear, though--there was definitely a good, healthy demand for a
<BR>
prostitution service.
