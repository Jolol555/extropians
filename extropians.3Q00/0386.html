I don't think anyone has blurred the distinction here, but I would like
<BR>
to make it clear that there is a significant difference between the
<BR>
methods of clinical psychology/psychiatry and those that practice
<BR>
psychotherapy. There are numerous psychotherapy approaches, quite a few
<BR>
of which have not, in my opinion, been properly researched, or
<BR>
demonstrated conclusively that they are successful at &quot;curing&quot;
<BR>
individuals. 
<BR>
<P>Clinical psychology on the other hand, tends to focus on assessment with
<BR>
carefully defined interventions (as they are called) following
<BR>
established, moderately successful, past practices. Psychiatrists take
<BR>
this a step further (to the side?) by having an advanced medical degree
<BR>
that grants them the privilege of dispensing medication to people with
<BR>
broken mental machinery. These types of psychologists often have similar
<BR>
methods of assessment as psychotherapists, but their approaches to
<BR>
treatment differ wildly from each other. Clinical methods tend to
<BR>
involve classifying symptomatic behavior into specific categories of
<BR>
mental illness/deficit from which associative interventions (medication,
<BR>
surgery, relaxation techniques, etc.) are prescribed. These methods of
<BR>
intervention tend to be based much more on empirical
<BR>
neuro-medical/cognitive research that can at least demonstrate some
<BR>
clear cause and effect(s), especially in the case of drugs. While
<BR>
psychotherapists tend to have their foundation of mental understanding
<BR>
based on dubious cognitive theories (Freud is the classic example).
<BR>
<P>I suspect, Tom, the major problem you have with psychotherapy is that it
<BR>
tends to view the cognitive/neurological workings of the brain as very
<BR>
black box. The common philosophy then is to treat it in somewhat of a
<BR>
black box manner: catharsis, free association, etc. Whereas,
<BR>
neurological approaches recognize there is some mystery, but some clear
<BR>
chains of causal effects can be seen. Appropriate medical or surgical
<BR>
interventions can then be administered with a higher degree of success,
<BR>
not to mention rationality.

<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Recently I was reading Robert Wright's excellent book &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Moral Animal&quot; and my mind wondered to several questions concerning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychotherapy and cognitive psychology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         In general, I question the value of psychotherapy as it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be an empirical science and the results seem to depend more on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practitioner than the practice.  I am mostly curious as to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generalized Extropian viewpoint on the value of psychotherapy given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropy's commitment to &quot;self-direction.&quot;  I recently read an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intriguing essay by Max More on the value of &quot;self-ownership&quot; and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonder if regimes such as this are in conflict with that ideal?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         Psychodrama, a subdivision of psychotherapy, emphasizes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; role-based metaphor system.  For instance, the &quot;emotional&quot; role and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;intellectual&quot; role are, in the ideal instance, thought to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equally balanced.  As I understand it, the emotional role concerns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself with such things as &quot;emotional expression&quot;; the intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; role concerns itself with rationalizations.  I'm interested in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insights and flaws of this metaphor system and it's value in general.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are there any promising treatments being advocated to replace fields
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such as psychotherapy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I am not adequately familiar with the idiosyncrasies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognitive psychology, but I'd love to hear any comments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I realize this letter is a bit vague, but mostly, I'm trying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to open up discussion. ;-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks,
</EM><BR>
