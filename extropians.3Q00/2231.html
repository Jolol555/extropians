I enjoyed this article about Australia.  Becky, the beautiful aussie girl I grew close to on the net was as I remember pretty mercenary in talking to me about the money part when it came to a prospective mate.  She ended up marrying a college dropout(I'm one too).  But from a huge close-knit Mormon family in Utah.  And her now husband had dropped out of school with a full scholarship that was to propel him to med school.  So he held much promise even as a loser.  If I'd had my act together I might have had a real chance.  For all I know she's pregnant now.  I hope she's happy...
