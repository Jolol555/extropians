<P><EM>&gt; I think you're missing part of the point Greg was trying to point to from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robin's paper &quot;Burning the Cosmic Commons&quot;.  If *any* civilizations produce 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colonization, then the effects that Robin suggests will come to dominate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the expansion.
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought I had responded in previous points, but I'll reiterate it
<BR>
here.  If *any* civilization gets to the point that it *can*
<BR>
colonize it is going to *look* to see where it should colonize.
<BR>
We are going to have astrometric data on a significant chunk of
<BR>
the stars in our galaxy (&gt; 1 billion around 2015), we will also
<BR>
probably have atmospheric data on any &quot;near-Earths&quot; around stars
<BR>
within 100 light years about that time.  So we will be able to &quot;see&quot;
<BR>
where we are going.  You are not going to want to go someplace
<BR>
unless you have a fairly high certainty that it is &quot;unoccupied&quot;.
<BR>
That means that you have to look twice distance-to-star + at least
<BR>
your trip travel time (say star @ 10 l.y., you take 60 years
<BR>
to get there, then you are going to want to look out to 70 l.y
<BR>
beyond that star for any signs of life).   Even more difficult
<BR>
you potentially want to be able to guarantee that any life on those
<BR>
even more remote planets must be more than 70 years behind the
<BR>
colonizing civilization.
<BR>
<P>If you don't buy the above argument, then you have to make a concrete
<BR>
case for civilizations &quot;leaping&quot; before the look.  As we have gotten
<BR>
more experienced (perhaps life has become more valuable) we tend to
<BR>
do less and less of that.  The only case I can see it happening in
<BR>
is a planet/star destroying event that is anticipated far enough
<BR>
in advance to flee it in world ships.
<BR>
<P>Now, I believe any civilization that has the capability to colonize is
<BR>
going to know nanotech is possible, know that colonization without
<BR>
nanotech is silly (because the post-nanotech probes/ships get there
<BR>
first), and so will wait until nanotech is fully developed.  Once
<BR>
nanotech is fully developed it is dirt-cheap to build millions of
<BR>
telescopes to conduct the careful surveys I've outlined above.
<BR>
The civilization is most likely to discover an uncolonized galaxy
<BR>
or a colonized one (because either of those is a much longer
<BR>
time period than a partially colonized one).  If it is uncolonized,
<BR>
then you colonize out to the limits dictated by your advance knowledge
<BR>
that is limited by the speed of light.
<BR>
<P>I would argue that the most likely situation is that that has already
<BR>
happened because Lineweaver indicated that 76% of the possible Earths
<BR>
in our galaxy are older than ours and most of them are much older.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If nearly all star systems are inhabited by SIs that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control all the matter at their star, then none of those entities are the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones who will expand, and you can leave them out of the calculation except 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as locations that gobble up probes.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you have to make an argument that a civilization would strike
<BR>
out and start colonizing *knowing* that SIs existed.  I've asked
<BR>
this before -- would Columbus or the Pilgrims have attempted
<BR>
to colonize North America *if* they had know it was occupied by
<BR>
millions of people whose technological capabilities, political
<BR>
preferences, etc. were unknown to them?
<BR>
<P>In the history of the Earth *most* of the colonization has occured
<BR>
in situations where the colonizers thought the apples were &quot;free&quot;
<BR>
for the picking.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Those that send out probes of whatever kind will colonize everything.  The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first wave will be slow and low tech, but it'll be followed by a faster, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher tech wave, and so it will continue.  Like the pilgrims who came to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; America, they'll be cut off from progress, possibly for the lifetimes of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the individuals involved.  But if they have any sense of history, they'll 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize that later generations will be in contact with whatever galactic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civilization ensues.
</EM><BR>
<P>If the colonizers don't look then this may be right.  If they do look
<BR>
and see nothing, then Robin's colony waves makes sense.  If they cannot
<BR>
*prove* to themselves that they will not be stepping on some giant's
<BR>
toes, then colonization should only occur when you have taken your
<BR>
civilization to the highest possible levels because that is the
<BR>
only way you can defend yourself if you piss someone off.
<BR>
<P>The question isn't what have we done in the past (colonized with
<BR>
little knowledge of physics and a lot of arrogance) -- it is --
<BR>
Knowing what you know might be possible, can you suggest the
<BR>
*wisest* colonization strategy for civilizations around our level?
<BR>
<P>When I look out into the galaxy, I don't expect to see the people
<BR>
who reproduced and colonized the most -- I expect to see the smartest
<BR>
people.
