<EM>&gt; &gt; But don't you think a more efficient method of get cheap energy would be

to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; increase oil drilling, especially outside OPEC controlled areas?  Also,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fomenting rebellion within OPEC might be another solution.  I'm not

calling

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The current spike in prices is not due to the suppliers, but due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increases in taxation and environmental mandates adding to the cost of
</EM><BR>
fuel.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Here in the US, most all the spike in the last year is a result of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introduction of new rules by the EPA regarding additives and processes for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; refineries. The fact that production has increased by 2 million barrels a
</EM><BR>
day
<BR>
<EM>&gt; over the last four months with no change in prices indicates that its not
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; matter of supply, unless this is a result of some european countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deactivating nuclear plants, with the electric demand being satisfied by
</EM><BR>
new
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fossil fuel burning plants.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think you are wrong here, but you seem not to be completely correct.
<BR>
After all, the price did rise after oil prices rose.  Some of the taxes on
<BR>
fuel here and abroad are also percentage based, so they fluctuate with the
<BR>
prices, making it far worse when prices rise fast.  Fuel taxes here, while
<BR>
lower than most of the world, are still a significant piece of the total
<BR>
price anyhow and this is not new.  Federal and State taxes on gasoline,
<BR>
e.g., have been around for decades.
<BR>
<P>Now, one area where you are very correct is that new regulations on refining
<BR>
processes and other environmental legislation has culled the oil refining
<BR>
capacity in the US.  This means that an increase in production takes time to
<BR>
find its way to the consumer, especially since the over a decade stable low
<BR>
price of oil sort of made everyone complacent, including regulators.  (Much
<BR>
as I despise regulators and their superiors, I don't think they intended to
<BR>
whack the prices up so high.  I might be wrong here...)
<BR>
<P>That said, I still think breaking up OPEC or otherwise creating dissension
<BR>
in its ranks would lead to greater supply and lower prices -- all other
<BR>
things being equal, of course.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
