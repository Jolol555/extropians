</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God  who gave us rights. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Given that we know the Washington, Jefferson and many others were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhat indifferent to organized religion was that phrasing literal or just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exhoratory?
</EM><BR>
<P>My point was that we should respect the reasoning of Washington,
<BR>
Jefferson, etc. only if it makes sense to us.  Just because they were
<BR>
Great Men whom we were taught to worship in state-sponsored schools is
<BR>
no reason to give special credence to what they say.
<BR>
<P>Forrest began by writing, &quot;The reason for an armed populace is very,
<BR>
very fundamental:&quot; and then he quoted the Declaration of Independence,
<BR>
which starts off by talking about God and how our rights come from him.
<BR>
<P>Why should we, who by and large reject theism, pay attention to a document
<BR>
which has this as the foundation?  Whatever the authors thought about
<BR>
God and organized religion, if they base their theory of natural rights
<BR>
on the principle that we are endowed with them by our Creator with a
<BR>
capital C, they aren't going to convince me.
<BR>
<P>Arguments from authority are always suspect.  Arguments from authorities
<BR>
whom we are taught practically to worship are especially so.  And when
<BR>
those authorities base their philosophies on positions which I find
<BR>
abhorrent, the arguments are virtually useless.
<BR>
<P>If someone wants to advance the idea that owning weapons is beneficial
<BR>
because it makes it harder for organized groups to impose their will
<BR>
on individuals, that's fine.  But quoting Jefferson isn't productive,
<BR>
at least not in this forum, at least not for me.
<BR>
<P>Hal
