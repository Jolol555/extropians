<EM>&gt; &gt; Okay, I've been wracking my brain for three days and I still can't figure this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What exactly IS the relevance of the gun discussion to Extropianism?
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; This was a bit of thread drift off of a discussion about which presidential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidate is a more extropic choice. I think most people on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that individual liberty is a very extropic thing. Brian, James,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Daniel, myself,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and others are apparently of the opinion that individual liberty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will only exist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so long as the individual can defend themselves and their individual liberty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against the agressions of other individuals, groups, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments, and given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the hostility with which candidates like Nader and Gore have toward both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual liberty and the individuals ability to defend that individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberty, I think that we pretty much agree that neither of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; candidates is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particularly extropic. Bush many not be much better, but he's more of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'lesser evil' type candidate, because he is for preserving our individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to defend our liberty, even though he may not be for every individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberty we support. While someone like Harry Browne comes closer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than most every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other candidate to most extropian values, his practical ability to win the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; election is about as good as a blind quadrapelegics chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hitting a bull's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; butt with a bass fiddle, and Gore actually has a decent risk of winning this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; election despite himself. In this case its rather obvious what a 'rational'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choice to make is for an extropian: put Bush in the white house.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>I tried.  I really tried to stay out of this, but I cannot any more.
<BR>
<P>The idea that I or anyone I know who values individual liberty would
<BR>
want to be involved with putting Bush or Gore in the White House makes
<BR>
me want to vomit.
<BR>
<P>I too want the right to defend myself.  But you know what?  There's
<BR>
not a single non-libertarian candidate who will stand up for your
<BR>
right to own the weapons of your choice.  And I mean *any* weapon you
<BR>
choose.
<BR>
<P>I want a candidate who will say that it was and is wrong that so many
<BR>
fellow US citizens I know have been arrested, imprisoned, and
<BR>
otherwise persecuted for their choice of drugs.  Any candidate who
<BR>
believes that those people deserved what they got and that I or any of
<BR>
my friends should be in jail cannot have my vote.
<BR>
<P>Jail is a pretty big threat to liberty.
<BR>
<P>Any candidate who doesn't want to do away with seizures of property
<BR>
through income taxes doesn't deserve my vote and doesn't deserve your
<BR>
vote.  Any candidate who wants to eliminate patients' rights to get
<BR>
medical procedures from their doctors, such as abortions, or drugs
<BR>
such as RU-486 doesn't deserve any of our votes.
<BR>
<P>This is not about the lesser of two evils anymore.  This is about
<BR>
acceptable tyranny.  As in: there's no such thing as acceptable
<BR>
tyranny.  
<BR>
<P>I won't be voting for any tryants this year, and neither should you.
<BR>
It doesn't matter if they're the lesser of two tyrants.  Don't vote
<BR>
for tryants.  Please.
<BR>
<P>Thanks,
<BR>
James
