Art Form for the Digital Age
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Henry Jenkins 
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;Video games shape our culture. It’s time we took them seriously. 
<BR>
<P>Last year, Americans bought over 215 million computer and video games.
<BR>
That’s more than two games per household. The video game industry made
<BR>
almost as much money from gross domestic income as Hollywood. 
<BR>
<P>So are video games a massive drain on our income, time and energy? A new
<BR>
form of “cultural pollution,” as one U.S. senator described them? The
<BR>
“nightmare before Christmas,” in the words of another? Are games teaching
<BR>
our children to kill, as countless op-ed pieces have warned? 
<BR>
<P>No. Computer games are art—a popular art, an emerging art, a largely
<BR>
unrecognized art, but art nevertheless. 
<BR>
<P>Over the past 25 years, games have progressed from the primitive
<BR>
two-paddles-and-a-ball Pong to the sophistication of Final Fantasy, a
<BR>
participatory story with cinema-quality graphics that unfolds over nearly
<BR>
100 hours of play. The computer game has been a killer app for the home PC,
<BR>
increasing consumer demand for vivid graphics, rapid processing, greater
<BR>
memory and better sound. The release this fall of the Sony Playstation 2,
<BR>
coupled with the announcement of next-generation consoles by Nintendo and
<BR>
Microsoft, signals a dramatic increase in the resources available to game
<BR>
designers. 
<BR>
<P>Games increasingly influence contemporary cinema, helping to define the
<BR>
frenetic pace and model the multi-directional plotting of Run Lola Run,
<BR>
providing the role-playing metaphor for Being John Malkovich and
<BR>
encouraging a fascination with the slippery line between reality and
<BR>
digital illusion in The Matrix. At high schools and colleges across the
<BR>
country, students discuss games with the same passions with which earlier
<BR>
generations debated the merits of the New American Cinema. Media studies
<BR>
programs report a growing number of their students want to be game
<BR>
designers rather than filmmakers. 
<BR>
<P>The time has come to take games seriously as an important new popular art
<BR>
shaping the aesthetic sensibility of the 21st century. I will admit that
<BR>
discussing the art of video games conjures up comic images: tuxedo-clad and
<BR>
jewel-bedecked patrons admiring the latest Streetfighter, middle-aged
<BR>
academics pontificating on the impact of Cubism on Tetris, bleeps and zaps
<BR>
disrupting our silent contemplation at the Guggenheim. Such images tell us
<BR>
more about our contemporary notion of art—as arid and stuffy, as the
<BR>
property of an educated and economic elite, as cut off from everyday
<BR>
experience—than they tell us about games. 
<BR>
<P>New York’s Whitney Museum found itself at the center of controversy about
<BR>
digital art when it recently included Web artists in its prestigious
<BR>
biannual show. Critics didn’t believe the computer could adequately express
<BR>
the human spirit. But they’re misguided. The computer is simply a tool, one
<BR>
that offers artists new resources and opportunities for reaching the
<BR>
public; it is human creativity that makes art. Still, one can only imagine
<BR>
how the critics would have responded to the idea that something as playful,
<BR>
unpretentious and widely popular as a computer game might be considered art. 
<BR>
<P>In 1925, leading literary and arts critic Gilbert Seldes took a radical
<BR>
approach to the aesthetics of popular culture in a treatise titled The
<BR>
Seven Lively Arts. Adopting what was then a controversial position, Seldes
<BR>
argued that America’s primary contributions to artistic expression had come
<BR>
through emerging forms of popular culture such as jazz, the Broadway
<BR>
musical, the Hollywood cinema and the comic strip. While these arts have
<BR>
gained cultural respectability over the past 75 years, each was
<BR>
disreputable when Seldes staked out his position. 
<BR>
<P>Readers then were skeptical of Seldes’ claims about cinema in particular
<BR>
for many of the same reasons that contemporary critics dismiss games—they
<BR>
were suspicious of cinema’s commercial motivations and technological
<BR>
origins, concerned about Hollywood’s appeals to violence and eroticism, and
<BR>
insistent that cinema had not yet produced works of lasting value. Seldes,
<BR>
on the other hand, argued that cinema’s popularity demanded that we
<BR>
reassess its aesthetic qualities. 
<BR>
<P>Cinema and other popular arts were to be celebrated, Seldes said, because
<BR>
they were so deeply imbedded in everyday life, because they were democratic
<BR>
arts embraced by average citizens. Through streamlined styling and
<BR>
syncopated rhythms, they captured the vitality of contemporary urban
<BR>
experience. They took the very machinery of the industrial age, which many
<BR>
felt dehumanizing, and found within it the resources for expressing
<BR>
individual visions, for reasserting basic human needs, desires and
<BR>
fantasies. And these new forms were still open to experimentation and
<BR>
discovery. They were, in Seldes’ words, “lively arts.” 
<BR>
<P>Games represent a new lively art, one as appropriate for the digital age as
<BR>
those earlier media were for the machine age. They open up new aesthetic
<BR>
experiences and transform the computer screen into a realm of
<BR>
experimentation and innovation that is broadly accessible. And games have
<BR>
been embraced by a public that has otherwise been unimpressed by much of
<BR>
what passes for digital art. Much as the salon arts of the 1920s seemed
<BR>
sterile alongside the vitality and inventiveness of popular culture,
<BR>
contemporary efforts to create interactive narrative through modernist
<BR>
hypertext or avant-garde installation art seem lifeless and pretentious
<BR>
alongside the creativity that game designers bring to their craft. 
<BR>
<P>Much of what Seldes told us about the silent cinema seems remarkably apt
<BR>
for thinking about games. Silent cinema, he argued, was an art of
<BR>
expressive movement. He valued the speed and dynamism of D.W. Griffith’s
<BR>
last-minute races to the rescue, the physical grace of Chaplin’s pratfalls
<BR>
and the ingenuity of Buster Keaton’s engineering feats. Games also depend
<BR>
upon an art of expressive movement, with characters defined through their
<BR>
distinctive ways of propelling themselves through space, and successful
<BR>
products structured around a succession of spectacular stunts and
<BR>
predicaments. Will future generations look back on Lara Croft doing battle
<BR>
with a pack of snarling wolves as the 21st-century equivalent of Lillian
<BR>
Gish making her way across the ice floes in Way Down East? The art of
<BR>
silent cinema was also an art of atmospheric design. To watch a silent
<BR>
masterpiece like Fritz Lang’s Metropolis is to be drawn into a world where
<BR>
meaning is carried by the placement of shadows, the movement of machinery
<BR>
and the organization of space. If anything, game designers have pushed
<BR>
beyond cinema in terms of developing expressive and fantastic environments
<BR>
that convey a powerful sense of mood, provoke our curiosity and amusement,
<BR>
and motivate us to explore. 
<BR>
<P>Seldes wrote at a moment when cinema was maturing as an expressive medium
<BR>
and filmmakers were striving to enhance the emotional experience of going
<BR>
to the movies—making a move from mere spectacle towards character and
<BR>
consequence. It remains to be seen whether games can make a similar
<BR>
transition. Contemporary games can pump us full of adrenaline, they can
<BR>
make us laugh, but they have not yet provoked us to tears. And many have
<BR>
argued that, since games don’t have characters of human complexity or
<BR>
stories that stress the consequences of our actions, they cannot achieve
<BR>
the status of true art. Here, we must be careful not to confuse the current
<BR>
transitional state of an emerging medium with its full potential. As I
<BR>
visit game companies, I see some of the industry’s best minds struggling
<BR>
with this question and see strong evidence that the games released over the
<BR>
next few years will bring us closer and closer to the quality of
<BR>
characterization we have come to expect from other forms of popular
<BR>
narrative. 
<BR>
<P>In the March 6 issue of Newsweek, senior editor Jack Kroll argued that
<BR>
audiences will probably never be able to care as deeply about pixels on the
<BR>
computer screen as they care about characters in films: “Moviemakers don’t
<BR>
have to simulate human beings; they are right there, to be recorded and
<BR>
orchestrated.... The top-heavy titillation of Tomb Raider’s Lara Croft
<BR>
falls flat next to the face of Sharon Stone.... Any player who’s moved to
<BR>
tumescence by digibimbo Lara is in big trouble.” Yet countless viewers cry
<BR>
when Bambi’s mother dies, and World War II veterans can tell you they felt
<BR>
real lust for Esquire’s Vargas girls. We have learned to care as much about
<BR>
creatures of pigment as we care about images of real people. Why should
<BR>
pixels be different? 
<BR>
<P>In the end, games may not take the same path as cinema. Game designers will
<BR>
almost certainly develop their own aesthetic principles as they confront
<BR>
the challenge of balancing our competing desires for storytelling and
<BR>
interactivity. It remains to be seen whether games can provide players the
<BR>
freedom they want and still provide an emotionally satisfying and
<BR>
thematically meaningful shape to the experience. Some of the best
<BR>
games—Tetris comes to mind—have nothing to do with storytelling. For all we
<BR>
know, the future art of games may look more like architecture or dance than
<BR>
cinema. 
<BR>
<P>Such questions warrant close and passionate engagement not only within the
<BR>
game industry or academia, but also by the press and around the dinner
<BR>
table. Even Kroll’s grumpy dismissal of games has sparked heated discussion
<BR>
and forced designers to refine their own grasp of the medium’s distinctive
<BR>
features. Imagine what a more robust form of criticism could contribute. We
<BR>
need critics who know games the way Pauline Kael knew movies and who write
<BR>
about them with an equal degree of wit and wisdom. 
<BR>
<P>When The Seven Lively Arts was published, silent cinema was still an
<BR>
experimental form, each work stretching the medium in new directions. Early
<BR>
film critics played vital functions in documenting innovations and
<BR>
speculating about their potential. Computer games are in a similar phase.
<BR>
We have not had time to codify what experienced game designers know, and we
<BR>
have certainly not yet established a canon of great works that might serve
<BR>
as exemplars. There have been real creative accomplishments in games, but
<BR>
we haven’t really sorted out what they are and why they matter. 
<BR>
<P>But games do matter, because they spark the imaginations of our children,
<BR>
taking them on epic quests to strange new worlds. Games matter because our
<BR>
children no longer have access to real-world play spaces at a time when
<BR>
we’ve paved over the vacant lots to make room for more condos and the
<BR>
streets make parents nervous. If children are going to have opportunities
<BR>
for exploratory play, play that encourages cognitive development and
<BR>
fosters problem-solving skills, they will do so in the virtual environments
<BR>
of games. Multi-player games create opportunities for leadership,
<BR>
competition, teamwork and collaboration—for nerdy kids, not just for
<BR>
high-school football players. Games matter because they form the digital
<BR>
equivalent of the Head Start program, getting kids excited about what
<BR>
computers can do. 
<BR>
<P>The problem with most contemporary games isn’t that they are violent but
<BR>
that they are banal, formulaic and predictable. Thoughtful criticism can
<BR>
marshal support for innovation and experimentation in the industry, much as
<BR>
good film criticism helps focus attention on neglected independent films.
<BR>
Thoughtful criticism could even contribute to our debates about game
<BR>
violence. So far, the censors and culture warriors have gotten more or less
<BR>
a free ride because we almost take for granted that games are culturally
<BR>
worthless. We should instead look at games as an emerging art form—one that
<BR>
does not simply simulate violence but increasingly offers new ways to
<BR>
understand violence—and talk about how to strike a balance between this
<BR>
form of expression and social responsibility. Moreover, game criticism may
<BR>
provide a means of holding the game industry more accountable for its
<BR>
choices. In the wake of the Columbine shootings, game designers are
<BR>
struggling with their ethical responsibilities as never before, searching
<BR>
for ways of appealing to empowerment fantasies that don’t require exploding
<BR>
heads and gushing organs. A serious public discussion of this medium might
<BR>
constructively influence these debates, helping identify and evaluate
<BR>
alternatives as they emerge. 
<BR>
<P>As the art of games matures, progress will be driven by the most creative
<BR>
and forward-thinking minds in the industry, those who know that games can
<BR>
be more than they have been, those who recognize the potential of reaching
<BR>
a broader public, of having a greater cultural impact, of generating more
<BR>
diverse and ethically responsible content and of creating richer and more
<BR>
emotionally engaging stories. But without the support of an informed public
<BR>
and the perspective of thoughtful critics, game developers may never
<BR>
realize that potential.&quot;
