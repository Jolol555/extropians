<EM>&gt;Where do you get tall from?  Being tall myself I appreciate the compliment,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but why is tall useful?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you have two people with exactly the same muscle/fat ratios, same 
<BR>
fitness level etc., then the taller one will always be stronger because 
<BR>
there's simply &quot;more of him&quot;. Danny De Vito could -at least theoretically- 
<BR>
grow muscles like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but he could never become as 
<BR>
strong as him. So being tall is (in this case) linked to being strong, and 
<BR>
being strong is quite handy for all sorts of things. If you got yourself an 
<BR>
artificial body, you'd want it to be &quot;superhumanly&quot; strong (among other 
<BR>
things) I presume, thus acknowledging that extra strength is good, but 
<BR>
until that's possible the best way to get the most out of a biological body 
<BR>
is to let it grow tall and muscular. Of course, somewhere around seven ft 
<BR>
or so you run into an effectiveness ceiling due to heart capacity (gravity 
<BR>
starts to become a real problem) etc., so you don't want to grow any taller 
<BR>
than that.
<BR>
<P>And yes, being tall simply looks better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Not good for space travel, for that matter it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;keeps air travel expensive.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that &quot;biological&quot; space travel has much of a future; the 
<BR>
final frontier will be the domain of anorganic posthuman entities that can 
<BR>
adapt much better to such a hostile environment. As for air travel: I doubt 
<BR>
that a couple inches more or less would have much of an impact on airline 
<BR>
costs, but even if this were the case, it would IMO be a small price to pay 
<BR>
for having a tall, powerful body.
