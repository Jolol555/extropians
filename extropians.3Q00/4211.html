<EM>&gt; Multiple businesses can make multiple billions from using this free market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yet very few (if any) civil rights will get quashed.  This is the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poignant example among others, in my opinion.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're kidding right?  Sure the Internet is definitely leveling hierarchies,
<BR>
but one only has to look at the DeCSS case, or many of the so-called
<BR>
cyber-squatter cases to see that it is the larger corporation that more often
<BR>
than not is coming out on top.  In case you haven't been following the most
<BR>
poignant recent example against civil rights I suggest you get yourself
<BR>
aquatinted with the DeCSS trial at <A HREF="http://www.2600.com/">http://www.2600.com/</A>  Not only has Judge
<BR>
Kaplan said that code is not protected speech, but that even linking to such
<BR>
code is also illegal.  And your telling me that civil rights are not getting
<BR>
squashed.  My hope is that the internet and the advent of peer-to-peer
<BR>
networking will level hierarchies beyond anything we've seen yet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Paul, before I address these sentences, I would like you to tell me who the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;little guy&quot; is.  What demographic do you have in mind?
</EM><BR>
<P>Isn't it glaringly obvious?  You and me of course.  The individual, your
<BR>
average non-millionare citizen, the non-incorporated being, the average joe,
<BR>
joe six-pack, mom, dad, your little sister, your friendly neighbor, the barber,
<BR>
your co-worker, the employee, the clerk, the gas station attendant, and anyone
<BR>
else without the financial or political power to manipulate or bully the legal
<BR>
or political process anywhere close to what a multi-billion dollar corporation
<BR>
is capable of doing.  This is especially true where the corporation is the
<BR>
plaintiff.
