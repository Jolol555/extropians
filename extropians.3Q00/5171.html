<EM>&gt; I was being 'orrible and flippant. But I had a point...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Firstly, all this &quot;mysticism&quot; stuff. Gag me with a spoon! 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if you insist.  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Special spiritual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insight, grokking the nature of reality; where does that really get you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Generally, a lot more integrated and peaceful.  Sometimes admittedly it
<BR>
can leave you simply blissed out and rather silly.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel like it does something positive, but I think it's really just feelgood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crud; I'd say you'd be hard pressed to show any measurable benefit of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; epiphany. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't be so quick to toss out as &quot;crud&quot; some of the central visions
<BR>
of human history.  Some of these visions have fueled lifes of great
<BR>
importance like those of some of the greatest scientists in history. 
<BR>
Some of them have fueled (admittedly not always for the good) entire
<BR>
civilizations.  Learn from this stuff.  Tap these energies if you can. 
<BR>
This is not all fluff.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It sounds suspiciously like the idea of psychedelic drugs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;expanding your consciousness&quot;. The idea appeals (at least under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence of them, as far as I recall), but it's pretty much meaningless in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any tangible context. In the end, this stuff is the enemy of rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought, basically by definition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you think then that rational thought is wholly and completely
<BR>
sufficient for all occassions and purposes?  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Secondly, and more importantly; this idea of building God for ourselves is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downright dangerous. The god meme has appeal; it's nice to believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's a point to the universe, after all (delusional as that may be). By
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extension, when you decide there isn't a God (or a Sysop), then it can seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a good idea to make one, or become one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>What the heck do you think building a Singularity is if not giving a
<BR>
tremendous &quot;point&quot; to the Universe or at least to human history?   If
<BR>
there is no point then the only point is what we decide to make a point
<BR>
of.  yes?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; What does that mean, though? If you are going to build a do-it-yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guardian (in the sense of Plato - it was Plato, wasn't it?) then I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's bad news; the best outcome we can hope for is failure. It's also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bloody arrogant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>If there is no God and mysticism is crud then in what context or in
<BR>
reference to what set of (presumably) rationally defined values is it
<BR>
&quot;bloody arrogant&quot;?  Particularly if we are all the intelligent life
<BR>
there is (as far as we know) then it would be a great shame if we didn't
<BR>
produce something for all the bother.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are going to become one, you either envisage being such a guardian,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or maybe raising everyone up to equal status. In the guardian case, the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguments apply as above. In the egalitarian case, where is godhood? It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more powerful beings, sure, but a society of such. So the concept of God is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not useful in that context.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The concept of a world of abundance, a world where many of todays
<BR>
horrors are things of the past (although who knows about new horrors?) a
<BR>
world where death is a thing of dim memory and the cosmos opens up
<BR>
before our expanded sentience is quite compelling and is as much of a
<BR>
&quot;heaven on earth&quot; as anything in any scripture.  Godhood is a relative
<BR>
thing in such a case.  As minds merge and become ever more powerful I
<BR>
suspect you reach a Singularity of such dimensions that the result will
<BR>
satisfy any and all non-contradictory tests of God-hood that can be
<BR>
devised.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Basically, the concept of God is all about authority, control, dominance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The ideas of benign rule, divine right, perfection. If you have any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individualist streak, these are anathema.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That is one view of God is about.  It is certainly not universal, not
<BR>
even among the world's major religions.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Gods will not help us where we are going. But they could seriously stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things up.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you're not objecting so much because you thing a god is impossible as
<BR>
because you think it would be a singularly bad thing (tm) if/when we
<BR>
manage to create one?  cool.
