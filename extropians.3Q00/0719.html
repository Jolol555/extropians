<P><EM>&gt; I knew pretty soon Spike and Damien would deteriorate this thread into a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty actress comparison, [snip]
</EM><BR>
<P>Damn trogladites, we can only hope that they will grow up someday...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The place this thread SHOULD have gone --
</EM><BR>
<P>Lord, where *are* the thread control police when you need them?!?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; when Anders began to take it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there-is not what plain featured actresses we need pant over, but is it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanist to make changes in our memes -- forming better ones ? Once we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the kind of technology that makes the mating ritual less of a knee-jerk 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reaction, our lust can be more in our control. Can be enhanced so to speak. 
</EM><BR>
<P>As I think Anders pointed out in another post, the problem is in selecting
<BR>
value systems.  Why would you *want* a system that (a) propagates mating
<BR>
structures in an era when people live indefinately and they become
<BR>
unnecessary; or (b) promote &quot;social&quot; behaviors?  Why would a self-directed,
<BR>
self-creating individual want to define themselves in terms of their
<BR>
social acceptance by others?
<BR>
<P>[The questions are somewhat rhetorical to highlight the degree to which
<BR>
humanity as we know it is an inherited yoke that may be highly undesirable
<BR>
from a transhumanist perspective.]
<BR>
<P>How do you create a blank slate (without pre-transhuman biases) on
<BR>
which to build a foundation for transhumans?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One thing that is a turn on for both sexes (at least on this list) is a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind. Sure it has to be attached to a sexy (whatever that is to you) body, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but brain power is a turn on.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but the ultimate &quot;mind&quot; is a singular mind that uses all of the
<BR>
local resources, creating subminds, allowing evolution, competition
<BR>
and ruthless natural selection (killing the subminds) when they fall
<BR>
short.  [Remember the Highlander -- &quot;There can be only one&quot;.]
<BR>
<P>Or do you want &quot;good&quot; minds as in kind, courteous, friendly, etc. having
<BR>
those qualities that are clearly leftovers from the era of &quot;social&quot; humans.
<BR>
After all, some species have no problems eating other members of their
<BR>
species, even their offspring.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When shared mind experiences become fashionable, we can tune in to someone's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain in ways that could be highly erotic, but not necessarily physical. A 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain-trip or mind-f**Ck or whatever you want to call it. No genetic mingling 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at all. Pure chemical and visual stimuli.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mapping mental experience maps between individuals will probably be one
<BR>
of the most difficult problems to solve.  Long before that it will be
<BR>
easy to self-stimulate those areas associated with pleasure, satisfaction,
<BR>
happiness, etc.  Once I can &quot;do&quot; myself, why would I want the fumbling,
<BR>
error prone, experience of an amateur other involved?
<BR>
<P>The only reason that now &quot;others&quot; are &quot;interesting&quot;, is that they create the
<BR>
sensation of the unexpected or unanticipated (which is why you cannot tickle
<BR>
yourself).  If you have sufficient self-mind intervention capacity, you can
<BR>
simply &quot;forget&quot; that you conceived of tickling/stimulating yourself in a
<BR>
specific way (thereby creating the satisfying illusion that someone
<BR>
else is doing it).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We are already heading in that direction, but in such a pathetic way (with so 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called cybersex). I am fascinated by the chat rooms in that the FIRST thing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people ask is how old? what do you look like? Why the need to keep the body 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at your sidew when you are floating in mind-space? I think fear. Fear of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flying... ; - )
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.  The chat rooms I've tried have been so mundane, even when billed
<BR>
otherwise that I've given up on them.  The memeset for interpersonal
<BR>
operations in the average chat room seems highly limited.  I wonder
<BR>
if the same is true in avatar based environments?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; With sex becoming less and less of a reproductive act and more of a conscious 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decision for pleasure, love itself may flourish as a mental exercise. There 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is nothing unromantic about the brain being the seat of love, it is actually 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MORE of a turn on that way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but both &quot;pleasure&quot; and &quot;love&quot; are nothing more than soft/hard-wired
<BR>
neuronal interconnects.  Do you really want evolutionary leftovers
<BR>
controlling the way you feel?
<BR>
<P>If you could rewrite the program from the foundation on up, what
<BR>
would you place as important?  For example -- take Maslow's (sp?)
<BR>
hierarchy of needs -- now restructure them from a transhumanist
<BR>
perspective.  Are any of them even *relevant* from a transhumanist
<BR>
perspective?
<BR>
