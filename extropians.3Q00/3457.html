&nbsp;&nbsp;While the U.S. media faithfully blacked out the

&nbsp;&nbsp;press conference of a panel of independent experts

&nbsp;&nbsp;who disagree with the official investigation of the

&nbsp;&nbsp;TWA Flight 800 crash, Agence France Presse cites it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Of particular note is that the flight data recorder

&nbsp;&nbsp;(FDR) expert who examined the black boxes claims

&nbsp;&nbsp;that four seconds were removed from the FDR data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;report was suddenly erased from that report at

<P>Independent panel criticizes TWA Flight 800 crash report
<BR>
<P>WASHINGTON, Aug 21 (AFP) -
<BR>
<P>An independent panel of experts on Monday lambasted the
<BR>
results of an official investigation into the 1996 fatal
<BR>
TWA Flight 800 crash, and maintained its theory the plane
<BR>
was downed by a missile.
<BR>
<P>According to the Flight 800 Independent Research Organization
<BR>
(FIRO), the official investigators had concealed crucial
<BR>
pieces of information from a final report to be presented
<BR>
Tuesday and Wednesday.
<BR>
<P>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report is
<BR>
expected to argue that the crash which killed 230 people
<BR>
off Long Island, New York, was most likely caused by an
<BR>
explosion in the plane's central fuel tank.
<BR>
<P>Many former investigators, military experts, and airline
<BR>
pilots continue to insist the Boeing was shot down by a missile.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Thirteen witnesses have seen an object strike the plane,&quot;
<BR>
FIRO president Tom Stalcup said in a press conference here.
<BR>
<P>Stalcup also argued against the investigators' theory that
<BR>
the plane had gained altitude following an initial explosion.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The magic climb theory contradicts the laws of physics,
<BR>
the radar data which recorded the flight path, and the
<BR>
witnesses accounts,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>Moreover, Stalcup continued, there were numerous ships
<BR>
within five kilometers (3.6 miles) of the area, but only
<BR>
one that had never been identified and which continued on
<BR>
its path as if nothing had happened.
<BR>
<P>Aviation consultant engineer Glen Schulze, who analyzed the
<BR>
so-called &quot;black boxes,&quot; also claimed that information was missing.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Four seconds of data has been removed from the Flight Data
<BR>
Recorder when the FBI was in charge of the investigation,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>Lending his weight to the argument of possible foul play,
<BR>
retired United Airlines pilot Richard Russell claimed he had
<BR>
received a copy of radar data showing a small object flying
<BR>
next to the plane that indicated a possible missile.
<BR>
<P>&quot;An (air traffic) controller has identified the target as
<BR>
potentially being a missile,&quot; Russell said, declining to
<BR>
identify his source of information.
<BR>
<P>NTSB investigators have explained that bystanders may have
<BR>
been looking at an arc of fire in the sky that occurred after
<BR>
the airplane broke in two and a part of the fuselage was briefly
<BR>
hurtled into the sky in flames.
<BR>
<P>The FBI initially tried to probe the missile theory, but later
<BR>
abandoned it and withdrew from the investigation altogether in
<BR>
the fall of 1997.
<BR>
<P>Six months after the catastrophe, the NTSB concluded that
<BR>
chemical analyses of metal from the fuselage showed no proof
<BR>
of damage caused by a bomb or missile.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, after four years of recovering debris from the
<BR>
ocean floor and partially reconstructing the plane in a huge
<BR>
hangar, investigators are preparing to close this most mysterious
<BR>
chapter in aviation history -- but without giving a definitive answer.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's a mystery, but a manufactured mystery,&quot; insisted Graeme
<BR>
Sephton, a projects engineer at the University of Massachusetts
<BR>
office of Information Technologies.
