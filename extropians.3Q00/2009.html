<P>Mike you were doing fine until you pulled that neutrino business.  John
<BR>
Clark is right of course, a post-NMD world is still vulnerable to plutonium
<BR>
delivered by means other than by air, and here is a thought that should
<BR>
give us pause: if we do manage to build a viable NMD, the next logical
<BR>
step is to figure out how to defeat those who would smuggle a few pounds
<BR>
under a pile of manure.  Such a technology is conceivable, but it does
<BR>
lead directly to universal surveillance, for it would likely require all-seeing
<BR>
nanodetectors carried throughout the world most likely by insects.  I am
<BR>
willing to pay this price.  Are you?
<BR>
<P>But before we suggest relinquishment of the technology for both for
<BR>
unisurv and and NMD, we must take the long view.  As time and
<BR>
technology march on, the fortunes of the advanced and free
<BR>
rise ever farther above the enslaved masses, and thus ever increases
<BR>
their motive to see us destroyed utterly.  The religiously enslaved
<BR>
for instance will make any sacrifice to prevent the wicked techno-
<BR>
devils from living forever.
<BR>
<P>Always keep in mind the ultimate goal is peace and the first line
<BR>
of defense is diplomacy.  But anyone who has ever been involved
<BR>
in negotiations will confirm this age old truth:  that diplomacy is
<BR>
so very much more effective if one has the appropriate weapons
<BR>
to demonstrate one's sincerity.  spike
