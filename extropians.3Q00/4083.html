Human cloning is now 'inevitable'
<BR>
<P>Independent survey reveals Britain's leading medical scientists predict
<BR>
'reproductive cloning' within 20 years despite public opposition
<BR>
<P>By Steve Connor, Science Editor
<BR>
<P>30 August 2000
<BR>
<P>Many of Britain's most eminent medical scientists believe the birth of a
<BR>
cloned baby is inevitable despite society's current aversion to the idea.
<BR>
<P>More than half of a panel of 32 scientists surveyed by The Independent said
<BR>
&quot;reproductive cloning&quot; would be attempted within 20 years if the technical
<BR>
and safety issues could be overcome. Their views stand in stark contrast to
<BR>
the public's vehement opposition to human cloning, which many people
<BR>
associate with fictional visions of armies of identical dictators.
<BR>
<P>A majority of the scientists interviewed, who included Lord Winston and
<BR>
Professor Richard Dawkins, also believe that if the use of limited
<BR>
&quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; for embryonic stem cells is successful, it will lead
<BR>
to a re-evaluation of the present law banning reproductive cloning of an
<BR>
adult.
<BR>
<P>A significant minority of those who took part in the survey - more than one
<BR>
in five - felt that reproductive cloning could also be justified on medical
<BR>
grounds, if for instance it was the only way for a couple to have a child of
<BR>
their own.
<BR>
<P>Later this year, MPs will be given a free vote on whether to allow limited
<BR>
therapeutic cloning. Opposition groups are expected to argue that to allow
<BR>
limited cloning of human embryos is &quot;playing God&quot; and will create a
<BR>
&quot;slippery slope&quot; leading to the cloning of an adult.
<BR>
<P>The results of the survey confirm what many medical scientists have said
<BR>
privately about the inevitability of someone, somewhere attempting the
<BR>
cloning of a human being even though it is banned in Britain and outlawed in
<BR>
many other countries.
<BR>
<P>One medical director of a London fertility unit, who did not wish to be
<BR>
named, went as far as to say: &quot;The equipment needed for cloning is simple
<BR>
and cheap, and, whether it is approved of or not, it will happen. It is
<BR>
unstoppable.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In our survey of doctors and scientists, many of whom have acted as
<BR>
government advisers, it was the in vitro fertilisation (IVF) specialists who
<BR>
took the most sympatheticline towards human reproductive cloning.
<BR>
<P>Peter Brinsden, medical director of the Bourn Hall Clinic in Cambridge,
<BR>
said: &quot;Reproductive cloning for ethically approved, very limited indications
<BR>
would now be acceptable to a large portion of society if explained properly.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Society's views on these difficult issues will change over the next 10 to
<BR>
20 years, in the same way they have over the past 20 years with many
<BR>
contentious subjects in the field of assisted reproduction.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Lord Winston, the foremost IVF expert in Britain, also believes that
<BR>
reproductive cloning will be attempted, although he said it could not be
<BR>
medically justified. &quot;It is difficult to predict how society will think
<BR>
about these issues in 20 years' time,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>Richard Dawkins, professor of the public understanding of science at Oxford
<BR>
University and an acclaimed author on evolutionary biology, also believes
<BR>
that reproductive cloning will eventually be attempted and that it might be
<BR>
justified. He said: &quot;People who object to research of this kind must explain
<BR>
exactly who would, in their view, be damaged by it. Phrases like 'playing
<BR>
God' form no part of a valid argument.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Many of the scientists who were interviewed emphasised that although they
<BR>
believe human cloning would happen, they personally hoped that it would not.
<BR>
<P>Azim Surani, of the Wellcome CRC Institute in Cambridge and a member of a
<BR>
Royal Society working party on cloning, was one of those who believed that
<BR>
reproductive cloning would not happen. &quot;Even if reproductive cloning is
<BR>
ultimately shown to work, it would be a big step to proceed to reproductive
<BR>
cloning,&quot; Dr Surani said. &quot;It is not possible to predict the outcome from
<BR>
reproductive cloning, as there are numerous and unpredictable detrimental
<BR>
effects on the resulting offspring. The risk will outweigh potential
<BR>
benefits for the foreseeable future.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Professor Richard Gardner, who chaired a Royal Society committee on cloning,
<BR>
believes human cloning will be attempted provided the technical and safety
<BR>
issues can be addressed and people understand what cloning really means.
<BR>
<P>He said: &quot;While there is likely to be a striking physical resemblance, the
<BR>
clone would differ from the original in most of the higher mental attributes
<BR>
that define an individual.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The big unknown, at present, is whether the technical and safety issues will
<BR>
ever be addressed. It took 277 attempts to clone Dolly the sheep - a success
<BR>
rate that has since improved but which is still inadequate to attempt a
<BR>
similar approach on human eggs.
<BR>
<P>Some cloning experts believe safety issues will prevent attempts at human
<BR>
reproductive cloning for many years to come. Austin Smith, an Edinburgh
<BR>
scientist who works on embryonic stem cells, said it was &quot;not possible to
<BR>
address the technical and safety issues involved&quot;.
