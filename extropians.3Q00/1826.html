<BR>
<EM>&gt; In a discussion in another forum, the question of whether computers have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;found&quot; valid mathematical proofs has come up.  Being mathematically stunted,
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought I'd do a hand-off of the question to this forum, since someone able
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to comment intelligently on the question probably inhabits this forum.  Any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leads or help?
</EM><BR>
<P>I read in the NY Times a few years ago about about a very interesting
<BR>
line of research manifested in &quot;EQP&quot;, a program whose moniker meant
<BR>
&quot;Equational theorem prover&quot;.  I find that EQP is not the top of the
<BR>
line of its family; that's a program called &quot;Otter&quot;.  You may read
<BR>
about both here:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/eqp/">http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/AR/eqp/</A>
<BR>
<P>Evidently, you can get EQP's source code and compile it yourself at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/Otter/eqp-09d.tar.gz">ftp://info.mcs.anl.gov/pub/Otter/eqp-09d.tar.gz</A>
<BR>
<P>This program used logical symbol manipulation rules, and was supposed
<BR>
to try to get from an originating set of symbols and other similar
<BR>
groups of symbols from its library of theorems to an unproven result.
<BR>
It not only proved an unproven conjecture, but it had the ability to
<BR>
analyze the intermediate lines in its proof for length and seek out
<BR>
alternate proofs that might employ shorter intermediate lines of
<BR>
symbols, more likely to appear to be obvious applications of rules to
<BR>
human beings.  Then, having proved a theorem, it could alter the depth
<BR>
of its lookahead search for transition lines that it believed,
<BR>
according to some scoring algorithm, could lead to a conclusive proof
<BR>
or disproof of the desired end result, so it could find more elegant
<BR>
proofs employing fewer steps.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I believe the research group working on EQP was supposed to
<BR>
improve it by allowing it to analyze strategies from successfully
<BR>
proven theorems so that it could continually upgrade its scoring
<BR>
algorithm.
<BR>
<P>EQP and Otter evidently eminate form Argonne National Labs.
