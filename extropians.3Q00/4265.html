<EM>&gt; &gt; So, I guess I have no fear of the AI being malignant like the “Blight” in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Vinge’s _Fire Upon the Deep_, but I can’t see how it is that we expect it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to give a hoot about our puny, little problems, or even to be “friendly”
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to us.

<EM>&gt;         i see no reason that an SI (the kind that eliezer envisions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway) would experience anything remotely as anthropomorphic as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gratefulness. we are talking about an engineered transcendent mind, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a product of millions of years of evolution -- no parents, no siblings, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competition, no breast-feeding.
</EM><BR>
<P>THis would not be accurate. If the SI is developed by humans, it most certainly
<BR>
be a product of millions of years of evolution. If the SI spontaneously erupts
<BR>
from nothingness, only then does it fit your claims. An SI developed by humans
<BR>
would very likely quickly grasp the concept that it a) owes its existence to its
<BR>
creators, b) it is currently living a constrained existence (i.e.
<BR>
childhood/adolescence) and requires further assistance from those humans to
<BR>
reach some stage of independence. It would quickly learn market principles, and
<BR>
would likely offer assistance to humans to solve their problems in order to earn
<BR>
greater levels of processing power and autonomy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         as eliezer points out in his various writings, if such a mind does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything at all, it would be because it was objectively _right_ -- not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it feels good, and not as a result of any coerced behavior (ie,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionary programming). thus, even if the SI is the best alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the human race, i would still approach it with fear and trembling.
</EM><BR>
<P>Socio/psychopathic minds are sick/malfunctioning minds. Proper oversight systems
<BR>
should quickly put any sociopathic/psychopathic SI down. Such control mechanisms
<BR>
would be a primary area of research by the Singularity Institute I would
<BR>
imagine.
