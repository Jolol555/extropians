<P><EM>&gt;Q: Why did the extropian cross the road?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A: Because of the inevitable evolution of lightbulb jokes towards more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advanced forms.

<P>Hee hee. Yup.

<P>On a completely unrelated note. I saw Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard
and Chuck Berry perform this evening. I didn't even know those great old
Rock-n-Roll guys could still play (I didn't even know they were still
alive!). What fun! 73-year-old Chuck Berry had 1000 people boogying
all over the concert dance floor! He didn't slow down one minute.
<P>Go Go Go ... Go Johnny Go..  Go Johnny Go.. Johnny B Good......
