<P>
Remember when technology was the best friend of most of the mainstream 
<BR>
environmentalist movement?  New crops would limit the amount of farmland
<BR>
needed.  Solar power (and even nuclear power) would reduce our reliance upon
<BR>
polluting coal and oil.  Maglev trains would make nosy, fuel-guzzling 
<BR>
aircraft obsolete.  Increased understanding of ecology was going to allow us
<BR>
to clean up polluted sites and held up better manage and protect endangered
<BR>
species.
<BR>
<P>well, what has changed?  &quot;No new rail&quot; cry environmentalist groups in the Bay
<BR>
Area.  &quot;Frankenfoods&quot; cry environmentalists in Europe.  Signs protesting 
<BR>
technology at all levels have been seen amongst the protesters outside the WTO
<BR>
meeting, the World Bank meeting, and the RNC and DNC gatherings in Philadelphia
<BR>
and Los Angeles.  Ted Kazcinski (sp?) is slowly becoming what he most wanted
<BR>
to be and what msot peopel scoffed at him ever becoming: a role model, an
<BR>
architect of what is increasingly becoming the manifesto of the neo-Luddite 
<BR>
movement.
<BR>
<P>When and where did we lose ground, and how can we remedy this situation?  I'd
<BR>
begin by saying that many of the technological solutions have been poorly 
<BR>
implemented, overhyped, and require a lot of social reengineering to be 
<BR>
plausible on the scale they were sold for.  Economic realities have sapped
<BR>
the urgency of some of the broadest-reaching but expensive &quot;green&quot; 
<BR>
technologies.  And finally, a combination of success in environmental causes
<BR>
and a growing  retrospiritual movement has led to the &quot;religionizing&quot; of the
<BR>
Left.
<BR>
<P>Environmentalism is becoming more f a religion than a sociopolitical thought,
<BR>
at least organized environmentalism.  The initial arguement against GM foods,
<BR>
for example, is the questions it poses for vegetarians, partticulaly those
<BR>
who have spiritual reasons for not eating meat - how many animal genes must
<BR>
be in something before it is considered an animal?  Also amongst 
<BR>
environmentalists, the notion of corporations as evil, and technologists as
<BR>
simply handmaidens for &quot;corporate greed&quot; (are these two words even separable
<BR>
anymore?) is accepted axiomatically.  In the eyes of most environmentalists, 
<BR>
ANY technology is evil, and will eventually aid and abet the &quot;pave the earth&quot;
<BR>
mentality, regardless o fhow &quot;green&quot; it may seem.
<BR>
<P>The economic reality of the world has changed since the 1970s.  OPEc seems 
<BR>
unwilling to play the sort of embargo games that gave the green technology 
<BR>
movement such a boost in the 1970s.  Growth in affluence, especially in the 
<BR>
United States, has led consumers to accept higher energy costs as a simple
<BR>
fact of life - there is no clamouring for a new clean technology in a world
<BR>
where 8 MPG SUVs are a status symbol.  Unfortunately, with the slowly lowering
<BR>
costs of energy and steel and other manufacturing goods, green technologies 
<BR>
cannot really compete economically.  And without price pressures to look for an
<BR>
alternative, certain key technologies (i.e. batteries) are moving slowly.
<BR>
<P>Unforutnately, green technology was also oversold, without taking into account 
<BR>
certain social values that make it difficult to implement.  Take, for example,
<BR>
rail.  Maglev rail has not really taken off as a means of moving people outside
<BR>
of certain runs in Europe and in Japan, both places where society is less
<BR>
car and space-oriented.  In the United States, the &quot;American Dream&quot; still 
<BR>
involves owning a private home in the suburbs, far away from the noise, bustle
<BR>
and crime of the cities.  Unfortunately, this has led to suburban sprawl, which
<BR>
is extremely inefficient for rail travel.  Additionally, after airline 
<BR>
deregulation, in addition to the lowered cost of fuel, aircraft tickets  have 
<BR>
become cheaper in real terms than hey were during the 1970s, for most 
<BR>
domestic flights in the US.
<BR>
<P>Fortunately, most of the public does not yet buy into the Fundamentalist Left's
<BR>
ideas of what environmentalism is.  There is still room to combat this image,
<BR>
and promote a more rational environmentalism, where technology is a key part.
<BR>
I would say we have little choice; it won't be long before there is a movement
<BR>
to ban all space launches because of the pollution caused by rocket engines.
