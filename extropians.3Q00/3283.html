May I ask why the two of you wanted the same last name?
<BR>
is the reason Symbolism.. Convenience.. something else?
<BR>
<P>Convenience mostly; Jodie didn't worry one way or the other, but I wanted us
<BR>
all to have the same last name - it's an IT person thing I think, a
<BR>
functionality concern; I wanted a decent top level identifier.
<BR>
<P>Seeing I was the one with the issue, I decided to take it apon myself to
<BR>
solve it; so I changed my surname. It's worked out very well. Changing your
<BR>
name, like getting rid of all your crap and moving somewhere with nothing,
<BR>
is a very cleansing experience; highly recommended.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>When I was married, my spouse and I chose to keep our own names.
<BR>
I like my name and I have a long publication record with it,
<BR>
however my ex didn't like his name, and changed both his first
<BR>
and last names, 5 years into our relationship. We still found
<BR>
though that the occassional stranger called him, Mr {my last name},
<BR>
and less-often, me, Mrs. {his last name}.

<P>Do you find this a helpful thing? The gender confusion is sometimes
<BR>
annoying, sometimes useful. Like when I was in highschool, and there was a
<BR>
school exchange with another school from a long way away, a bunch of people
<BR>
going from each school to the other, and being billetted with families
<BR>
there. I was mistakenly assigned to be billetted by a girl, rather than a
<BR>
boy, because they thought I must be a girl from my name. Initially
<BR>
embarrassing, it turned out rather well...
<BR>
<P>When we registered Lochlainn's birth, Jodie and filled in our details as
<BR>
mother and father; then we received a letter from BD&amp;M, because of some
<BR>
minor beaurocratic crud that needed clearing up. They wrote to me as the
<BR>
mother, and Jodie as the father, even though we were clearly listed as the
<BR>
other way round on the form.
<BR>
<P>I remember reading Edward deBono talking about intelligence as being like
<BR>
owning a fast car; doesn't make you a good driver. Stuff like the above
<BR>
shows that some people are just  catching the bus.
