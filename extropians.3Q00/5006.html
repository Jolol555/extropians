<BR>
<P>I think there are other similiar devices out there. What's nice about this
<BR>
is the portability- you could carry one into a library, and with enough
<BR>
memory in the device and time you could scan in multiple books there for
<BR>
free, and then upload to Freenet or whatever so everyone can have access
<BR>
to them.

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you know better I would very much like to know how to improve on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; this.  I've been wanting my library online for many years now. - samantha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (then spike)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;You and all of us.  I have over a thousand titles, most of em
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hardback.  Ideally I would like to ASCII all the text without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;destroying the books, if possible.  Let me know if you find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anything workable.  {8-]  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This has been an interest of mine now for several years.  Its value as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumer product is, I assert, obvious, and I would guess that Samantha,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spike, and I are only three of millions who would make use of it on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instant it became available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I therefore offer to join forces with anyone who would like to collaborate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in its development as a commercial project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It could be a book holder and page turner that mounts/sets on a flatbed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scanner (the page turner and scanner would clearly be linked to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer which would coordinate the sequence of events), or a book holder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and page turner equipped with a mounting frame to accomodate a digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; camera (again, camera and page turner linked to the computer), or it could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a single dedicated unit: one power cable, one data cable to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer, and a slot for placing the book (or, in the large industrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; model, a stack of books).  I suggest that these three variants comprise the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginnings of a product line.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The IP issues as I see them: it would be a product that fills a strongly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sought after, completely legitimate demand, but which enables an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;illegitimate&quot; application.  I'm completely convinced that, after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; precedents set by the vcr, cassete recorders, xerox copiers, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already established fact of scanners and ocr, no legal challenge could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successful, in fact I rather doubt such a challenge would even be mounted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I gotta believe this in the works already, if not imminent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Probably by the scanner people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Somebody out there knows.  Who can burst my bubble?  Or, since I like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea so much and am waiting with cash in hand, cmon someone...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SHOW ME THE MAGIC!
