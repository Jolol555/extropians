In an earlier email in this thread, Eliezer wrote the following:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;If, as seems to be the default scenario, all supergoals are ultimately
</EM><BR>
arbitrary, then the superintelligence should do what we ask it to, for
<BR>
lack of
<BR>
anything better to do.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>In another email, Eliezer wrote this:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If it's smart enough, then it won't make mistakes.  If it's not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smart enough,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then it should be able to appreciate this fact, and help us add 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safeguards to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent itself from making mistakes that would interfere with its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own goals.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm having a difficult time reconciling these 2 statements.  If the SI
<BR>
has no preferences and would do whatever asked for lack of anything
<BR>
better to do, then how could it be said to have its own goals?
