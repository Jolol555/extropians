<EM>&gt; &gt; Linux is very nice but it is a tool somebody has made so they don't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pay for the tools from other. Free hammers would also be nice for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; carpentry business but would destroy the hammer business. So you can turn it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; around and say that if people want free music they should make it themself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Just like the Linux crowd supposedly does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here is the difference, about the software/hammer analogy.  Making two copies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a software is a marginal action.  Making two copies of a hammer requires twice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the quantities the comprise the hammer.  Also, making a hammer requires forging,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; casting, or machining the hammer head and possibly the handle, or carving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, both software and hammer have start-up costs, the software's fixed costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being the programming time and code and test platforms which are mostly reused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or reusable, while the hammer has the fixed costs of the machines and tools to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make the hammer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After the fixed costs, reproducing software is basically a costless operation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I see those as obvious statements.
</EM><BR>
<P>Take printed material, like a book. I can cut off the binder and feed it
<BR>
into a Docutech scanner and reproduce as many as I want for only a
<BR>
couple bucks each. Should I be able to do that? How about once I've
<BR>
scanned it in (which only takes a couple minutes of time) I send it to
<BR>
my workstation and have the scanned pages OCR'ed. I can now send that
<BR>
book anywhere. Have I broken any laws? Its easy to reproduce that book
<BR>
now for nothing, and I don't need to mess with printing costs, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Linux or the other free UNIXs were not free, they are made from thousands upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands of programmer hours and precursor code, they were just freely given.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is a concept of sum societal utility.  Linux, free, has contributed to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sum societal utility many times over its investment given by volunteer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmers and supporters, some might say.  Some statistics have it running
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except that linux is NOT free. It typically is sold on CD-ROM for
<BR>
$40-80, which is little different from other operating systems. Can I
<BR>
reproduce a Redhat CD-ROM and sell them for a buck if I want to? No, I
<BR>
can't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Copyright laws are in place for a reason, and most of them are good laws.  Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patent laws, in my opinion, are cumbersome and infringe upon the growth of sum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; societal utility, and any patent should expire in twelve years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Given Moore's Law, most any patent on computer related items issued at
<BR>
the time of its technological and economical applicability has only an
<BR>
18 month window of marketablity.
