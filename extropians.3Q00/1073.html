<EM>&gt; Assembly and construction use intelligence, just as design does.

<P>Hmmmm, if that is true, then how do we measure the IQ of a bacteria?
<BR>
Self-assembly can be done quite simply by throwing the parts in a heap
<BR>
and shaking or stirring until the desired result is obtained.  The
<BR>
tough nut is to design the pieces so they can effectively self-assemble.
<BR>
That is generally not how macro-scale design is currently done.
<BR>
The only example I can quickly think of are things like collapsed
<BR>
cardboard file boxes that if you push and pull on them enough will
<BR>
assemble themselves into an actual box.
<BR>
<P>A software team (at Brandeis?) has shown that you can do rather
<BR>
kludgy design of mechanical &quot;stuff&quot; simply by randomly varying
<BR>
the assemblies (mutation?) and recognizing when you actually have
<BR>
something that works (selection).  So I would have to say most
<BR>
of the intelligence involved is in recognizing when you actually have
<BR>
a part that does what you want (including potentially self-assemble).
<BR>
Intelligence would also seem to come into play in being able to prove
<BR>
you have the most efficient assembly or construction path.
<BR>
But if my theorem proving exercises are typical, it would seem
<BR>
that there is a lot of mutation and selection in that process
<BR>
as well.
