<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20human/world%20interfaces&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGMEIOFJAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<EM>&gt; [mailto:<A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=RE:%20human/world%20interfaces&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGMEIOFJAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>]On Behalf Of White, Ryan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would like to share the following observation:  I found mathematics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially multidimensional calculus, incredibly difficult, until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learned to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adapt visualization strategies to the learning process.  Looking at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equations on paper engaged weaker parts of my brain - it was only after I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagined the functions in a 3d space in front of me, and set the image in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motion if called for, that I achieved what I would call true understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the techniques.  I found myself drawing pictures almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everywhere in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; studies - mathematics, physics, and biosciences.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is similar to my experiences, except that I shifted to the visual mode
<BR>
only after exhausting my kinesthetic resources, which served me well in
<BR>
situations involving 2 or fewer variables.  (so I wonder if a person who
<BR>
spent lots of time swimming or who lived under conditions of very low
<BR>
gravity would have an easier time dealing with 3 dimensions
<BR>
kinesthetically...)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came to mathematics, I saw this as a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; gift, UNTIL I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started dealing with systems with more than four dimensions (x,y,z,t).  ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My difficulty visualizing four dimensional space (or fractional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dimensional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; space) forced me to suffer the far-more-difficult symbolic mode(s) of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; learning.  It was incredibly frustrating.  How does one exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to visualize dimensional spaces outside our normal realm of experience?
</EM><BR>
<P>I found functions of complex variables quite difficult to comprehend, a
<BR>
problem which was exacerbated by the fact that the person teaching the
<BR>
course was Japanese and spoke very little English, and had the habit of
<BR>
standing directly in front of what he was writing on the blackboard so that
<BR>
the students couldn't see what he was doing. I've found that when dealing
<BR>
with very abstract math, I must go back to the beginning and derive the
<BR>
system &quot;from scratch&quot; if I hope to understand it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know exactly what you mean by synesthesia.  I know enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conclude that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in normal modes of consciousness, I observe no significant blurring of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lines between sensory modalities.  But, I will report to you in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earnest that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have induced these experiences, in replicated experiments, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychoactive chemicals.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The best thing that ever happened to me was the hippy culture.  Suddenly,
<BR>
there were all these people doing drugs and seeing the world somewhat as I
<BR>
saw it all the time. I could be &quot;myself&quot; without having to think through
<BR>
what I was going to say to make sure it didn't come out seeming too weird.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Mostly, I saw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colors and felt textures in music and other auditory experience.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh yes! Certain pieces of music are for me like receiving a full-body
<BR>
massage, and other pieces evoke exotic visual scenes.  I was particularly
<BR>
fond of Sebelius when I was young and while listening to the music would,
<BR>
for example, see myself walking through a dark pine forest and coming out at
<BR>
the edge of a silvery city that resembled a cross between an oil refinery
<BR>
and a coral reef.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Patterns
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of motion and pressure across my skin induced similar visual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiences.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't remember any accounts of 'tasting' images, sounds, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tactile events.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can't recall anything like this either, although smells might evoke sights
<BR>
and sounds; it seems to be a one-way thing.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Hearing sounds in coincidence with other sensory modalities falls into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special category, because I found it difficult to differentiate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synesthesia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from auditory hallucination by other external causes.
</EM><BR>
<P>You've lost me here.  If you hear something from an external cause, it
<BR>
wouldn't be a hallucination, would it?  Or do you mean that you hear
<BR>
something but translate it into something different?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;These
<BR>
<EM>&gt; events, though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difficult if not impossible for me to re-experience from memory in (more)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; normal modes of thought, I can confirm through the honest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scribblings in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notebooks.  The vocabulary I used to describe events, both internal and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; external, are strongly suggestive of it.  Dare I say more?
</EM><BR>
<P>I wish you would dare to say more.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;One
<BR>
<EM>&gt; last thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About my writing.  I have gone back to read what was written under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; influence of chemicals thus conducive, in normal consciousness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on some occasions: 'I was insane.  This is madness - it makes no sense.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then, on a later date, appropriately 'modified,' I could go back,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the thoughts as written, and experience nearly total recall, and total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding of how and what I was thinking, where I left off...  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strongly suggestive of modes of thought, different patterns of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'mind-modules'  activated, that can be revisited reliably by ingesting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same substance at a later time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I read research by such people as Charles Tart, which strongly suggests that
<BR>
we do function in this way.  One of the experiments, as I recall, involved
<BR>
having subjects learn something while under the influence of a psychoactive
<BR>
drug.  Later, the subjects were tested on what they'd learned, and it turned
<BR>
out that they scored poorly when they took the test in their ordinary states
<BR>
of consciousness; but when they were tested under the influence of the same
<BR>
drug that was used when they learned the material, they scored significantly
<BR>
better.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;I am intensely curious about the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synesthetic experiences as reported by others.
</EM><BR>
<P>I read of an interesting experience of 2 graduate students (I wish I could
<BR>
find this again--it may well have been something written by C. Tart).  The 2
<BR>
students put each other into a trance state, and they later reported having
<BR>
gone through similar experiences while in the trance state--I don't say
<BR>
&quot;identical&quot; because each one was experiencing things from his own point of
<BR>
view--but the experiences matched.  Together, these students explored exotic
<BR>
worlds, but they became frightened by the experiment and stopped.  I have no
<BR>
idea whether this is true.  It doesn't match any experiences I've ever
<BR>
had--but then I've never found anyone willing to try it with me.  People
<BR>
seem put off by the very idea of doing such a thing.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hypothesize that some
<BR>
<EM>&gt; modalities are more strongly correlated than others, with respect to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coincidence of perception.  I believe this data has the potential to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elucidate some interesting facts about how the brain associates and stores
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these sorts of experiences.
</EM><BR>
<P>It would also be interesting to examine how the brain, working with stored
<BR>
information, synthesizes completely new mental creations. The creative
<BR>
process is of never ending fascination to me
<BR>
