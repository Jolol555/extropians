<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----

<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20hormoos&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGKEOHFOAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.org</A>

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My little sister worked part time for a local dairy farmer (she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with cows very relaxing after a long day dealing with hospital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morons' self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generated problems with their computers) and is of the opinion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the guy she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked for is also of the opinion based on his own research, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BGH is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threat, that its all just scare tactics by 'organic' farmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to boost the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market for their higher priced products.
</EM><BR>
<P>What sort of research did the guy your sister worked for do? I haven't seen
<BR>
any research on BGH, but I've looked at the research on 2,4-D, which is a
<BR>
synthetic plant growth hormone.  Some of the research concludes that it
<BR>
causes cancer in mammals; other research says it doesn't, and it's not
<BR>
always obvious from the published papers why there should be such
<BR>
discrepancies. Possibly there's some factor that wasn't controlled for, such
<BR>
as the presence or absence of other synthetic hormones in the animals'
<BR>
diets, possibly some of the data was faked--who knows?
<BR>
<P>My basic strategy is to err on the side of caution when it comes to eating
<BR>
potentially powerful chemicals, whether they be naturally occurring or
<BR>
synthetic.   I don't, for example, eat datura seeds or mescal beans or the
<BR>
glandular secretions of frogs. Clearly, 2,4-D and BGH are not as toxic as
<BR>
those things.  I may be silly to avoid them, and in fact I don't always
<BR>
avoid them. I DO sometimes eat in restaurants or at the homes of people who
<BR>
aren't as picky about their food as I am. But I don't think I'll feel
<BR>
comfortable eating these hormones regularly until I'm able to figure out why
<BR>
there are such differences in the research results.
