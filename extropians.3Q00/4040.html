You're quite evasive in this reply J.R. so I'm just going to basically
<BR>
repeat my posting and see if I can pin you down on a few of the particulars:

<P><P><EM>&gt; Jason Joel Thompson wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's not valid if &quot;unreal&quot; is a null set.  It holds no meaning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But it's not a null set. Unreal means that which is false, untrue,
</EM><BR>
fictional,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; having no reality, actual existence, or substance.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it is not a null set, then please indicate what things belong in the
<BR>
realm of &quot;having no reality.&quot;  You can't have it both ways-- either reality
<BR>
is all encompassing in which case the term holds no discretionary meaning,
<BR>
or there are things that are not a part of reality, in which case reality
<BR>
has limits.
<BR>
<P>This circular game of semantics is getting less and less interesting for me,
<BR>
so maybe we should let it drop from our conversation, unless you have new
<BR>
insight to provide regarding the usefulness of your definition of the term
<BR>
'reality.'
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Do you believe that there are unreal things?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Belief has nothing to do with it. I accept that there are bogus inventions
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophers.
</EM><BR>
<P>I see.  And these bogus inventions are outside of the realm of reality?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ah... I see the nature of our disagreement.  You believe that you are
</EM><BR>
able
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to perceive reality directly?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone can perceive reality directly. Just stop thinking about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've already made good arguments why this isn't the case.  I invite you to
<BR>
respond to them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So, when you look at a pen, you believe that you are directly seeing the
</EM><BR>
pen
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as opposed to photons that have been reflected from its surface?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, when I look at a pen I don't &quot;believe&quot; anything. I simply look at the
</EM><BR>
pen.
<BR>
<P>Damn, you're slippery.  :)  Let me try again:
<BR>
<P>I'm asking you now, in retrospect:  Do you, currently, hold the belief that
<BR>
when you look at a pen, you are seeing the actual object, or do you now,
<BR>
currently, hold the belief that when you look at a pen you are seeing
<BR>
photons reflected from its surface?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I do not place absolute belief in my senses.  I am aware of the fact
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they represent information regarding properties of the object and not
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; object itself.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hopefully you don't do that while driving. You'd be a menace on the
</EM><BR>
highway.
<BR>
<P>Please explain why, in detail.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Let us suppose that I have a bunch of multi-colored tennis balls, that I
</EM><BR>
am
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bouncing up against some object.  And let us further suppose that due to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nature of this object, only the orange balls are 'springy' enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ricochet over a wall and land in your lap.  Do you think that only
</EM><BR>
receiving
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; orange balls from the object is an indication that the object itself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; orange?  Or instead an indication of a particular property of the
</EM><BR>
object?
<BR>
<P>I am quoting myself again here in the hopes that you will respond to this
<BR>
argument.  I invite you to do so at length.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; When you stop imagining things and simply see things as they are, then you
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; awakened from your reverie of suppositions and conjecture.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People can conjure all sorts of philosophic nonsense to entertain
</EM><BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't consider it extropic at all to waste time with such silliness.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I mentioned in my first post, this is mostly a mental exercise, to which
<BR>
you responded:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well, like the man said, &quot;use it or lose it.&quot;&quot;
<BR>
<P>Have you decided this particular exercise is no longer valuable?
<BR>
<P>There are -some- benefits to questioning the fundamental nature of reality,
<BR>
but I'll grant, for now at least, they are mostly hypothetical.
<BR>
