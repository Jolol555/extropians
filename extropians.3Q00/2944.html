<EM>&gt; In fact, I would love to call a moratorium on the &quot;it's impossible, don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bother,&quot; argument-- why not try arguing the case of the basis of whether it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is desirable and leave your inability to imagine innovative solutions at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; door.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are numerous examples of humans imposing arbitrary order upon a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in order to exert a desirable influence over it.  In my opinion, government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is simply a form of social technology, and a powerful tool in our arsenal.
</EM><BR>
<P>The danger with this approach is that it tends to overlook the costs of
<BR>
your enforcement tools.  The point I see the anti-IP people making is
<BR>
that intellectual property rights are inherently difficult to enforce
<BR>
because IP is so distributed.  With regular property you can hope to
<BR>
put a guard on what you own, but with IP, you want to both distribute
<BR>
it and control it.  This requires that you have some kind of &quot;guard&quot;
<BR>
that can go along with each copy.  It's tough to do when IP is just
<BR>
information and so easily copied.
<BR>
<P>So the reality is that IP is different from other forms of property.
<BR>
If you rule out discussions of this difference in terms of looking
<BR>
at desirability, you overlook much of the big picture.  Maybe you can
<BR>
control IP, but only at the cost of, for example, disallowing encryption.
<BR>
(David Brin seemed to me to be taking this view in early drafts of
<BR>
his book on transparency.)  Or you need to make it illegal to reverse
<BR>
engineer copyright protection systems, like the controversial DMCA law
<BR>
which is being used to shut down the Linux DVD players.  Such proposals
<BR>
have significant costs.
<BR>
<P>In my view, you can't ignore the reality of the difficulties of
<BR>
controlling IP and just focus on how desirable it would be if you could.
<BR>
If IP were just like regular property, probably everyone would agree that
<BR>
it should be controlled in the same way.  Most people here are fervent
<BR>
advocates of property rights.  It is only because it is different that
<BR>
some are calling for different treatment.
<BR>
<P>I agree that it is an overstatement to say that controlling IP is
<BR>
&quot;impossible&quot;.  We don't know yet what will and will not be possible.
<BR>
No doubt a sufficiently Draconian, invasive and universal political
<BR>
system would allow for control of IP.  But in terms of our understanding
<BR>
of the technical issues, it appears that controlling many forms of IP
<BR>
will be difficult and costly to achieve.  Ultimately it is these costs
<BR>
which are driving the proposals for rethinking how we manage IP.
<BR>
<P>You might want to revisit John Kelsey and Bruce Schneier's excellent
<BR>
analysis of the technical difficulties facing IP control systems at
