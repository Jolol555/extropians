<P>
<EM>&gt; Lee, instead of insulting us &quot;who claim to be creative&quot;, why dont you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illuminate, this is a very intersting subject. I woudl like to know.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've done that many times, here and elsewhere, so it's kind of tiresome
<BR>
for me now.  I had planned to write up much of it as a book, and had
<BR>
made an outline of that; perhaps I'll have some time to finish some of
<BR>
that soon.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I intended to be mildly insulting, because today's artists do need
<BR>
a kick in the pants, and deserve it.  They are being royally screwed
<BR>
by record companies, publishers, and the other monopolists of the IP
<BR>
industry and are taking it lying down.  They need to wake up and realize
<BR>
that they can't just create words and music and art--they actually do
<BR>
have to do some of the work of creating money themselves, and they have
<BR>
to throw away the idiotic &quot;art for art's sake&quot; mentality that has been
<BR>
keeping them enslaved for so long.
