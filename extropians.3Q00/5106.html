<EM>&gt;But the buttons get pressed sometimes quite 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spontaneously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and out of the blue. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The first time I remember it happening was when I was 5 years old.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was examining a common everyday clothespin, the kind with the coiled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spring and the two pieces of wood.  I was fascinated by its design 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; action.  As I played with it my mind ran around the loops of its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and its levers. Suddenly I &quot;grokked&quot; it.  
</EM><BR>
<P>This sort of thing happens to me as well.  It's as though there's some
<BR>
vast memory containing all possible knowledge and sometimes some of the
<BR>
knowledge is fired off into my mind.  The first time I remember the sort
<BR>
of thing you describe with the clothespin was when I was under 3 years
<BR>
old (I know this, because we moved from the house where it happened when
<BR>
I was 3).  I was watching the sun's light reflecting from  grains of sand
<BR>
in the alley behind our house.--noticing the way the reflections changed
<BR>
as I moved my head.
<BR>
<P>Occasionally the knowledge comes in dreams--this happened more often when
<BR>
I was younger than it does now.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; that such Powers may not occassionally tickle the minds and cultures 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developing species with ideas/images/memes leading to the creation 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others of their kind  and/or preparing for the acknowledgement of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existing ones? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Could be an explanation for the sudden bursts of knowledge. Maybe it
<BR>
happens more frequently than one would suppose, but most of the time the
<BR>
recipient is not in a position to put it to good use.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It might even be a key useful in understanding and even pulling into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some cooperation the world's religions.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, I think cerrtain members of our species do have access to such 
<BR>
keys. I think that  probably the greatest challenge is finding the right
<BR>
locks.
