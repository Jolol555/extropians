</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Aha... art!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Cute, but then you trivialize art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, that's sort of what I'm doing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or rather: showing that art likes to hide in odd places and tends to crawl
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away under observation.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  I tend to think art is something specific, but centuries of bad
<BR>
analysis of the idea have led people to give up on finding out what it is.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   If art is only &quot;word games and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; posturing,&quot; then it takes no great skill and any charlatan is an artist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've often thought that much art is akin to illusion: it is evocative of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something intangible.  The realistic approach to a concept or object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involves our approaching it on a functional level, i.e:  What does this
</EM><BR>
do?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; How can it help me?  How can I interact with it?  What information does it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You rarely look at a painting in this manner, unless you are concerned
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the frame might fall on you.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  People read books, watch films and plays, listen to poetry and
<BR>
song, look at sculpture and painting and often ask questions that approach
<BR>
these art objects as if they were real.  On one level, art evokes a
<BR>
realistic attitude.  One gets caught up, in a good play, e.g., in the action
<BR>
and the characters as if they were real.  To the degree that illusion is
<BR>
destroyed, often the art is less powerful, less well done.
<BR>
<P>Also, &quot;illusion&quot; as a concept is well defined.  An illusion is
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I rarely bother to engage people who attack art as being functionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; useless-- mostly because I agree that they are basically right... except
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insofar as that function is to attack/uplift the realm of the mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree with &quot;attack&quot; here, but I think on the function of art, you are
<BR>
basically right.  Art works don't have a direct practical function.
<BR>
Sculpture is not made to hold up houses and ballets are not strictly for
<BR>
exercise.  (They both can serve those functions, but it would only be
<BR>
secondary and would not distinguish a ballet from aerobics.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Much of art lives in this realm of the mind, and as such, much of art is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily subjective.  It is neither possible nor desirable to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absolute classifications for what does and does not qualify as art.  One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person's art is another's toilet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's where I disagree.  I think tastes are subjective, but art is not.  To
<BR>
reiterate.  One can agree with a certain work being art, yet not like it.
<BR>
One can also like something, yet not call it art.  I like chocolate covered
<BR>
almonds, but I do NOT think they are art.  I do not like Salvador Dali's
<BR>
paintings, yet I think they ARE art.
<BR>
<P>Also, given your views on the function of art, you seem to already be closer
<BR>
to my view than to a purely subjective one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would never say that someone was 'wrong' to call something 'art,' simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because I do not think that one can be mistaken.  In this, all things are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potentially art.  (And &quot;not&quot;art)
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree here also.  If you posit a mental function for art, then only
<BR>
things which can serve that function would be art.  You alreayd have a tacit
<BR>
way of measuring art that is not subjective.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Art happens somewhere in the space between the object and the mind of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; observer.  We do not call something -great- art because -many- people call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it art, but rather that -discerning- people call it art.  In fact, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anticipated that great art is necessarily challenging and is only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occassionally embraced by the majority.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is really only so with Modernist Art and Postmodernist Art.  While
<BR>
taste vary from age to age, from person to person, it's only with the 20th
<BR>
century that we get works which would only fit an elitist, authoritarian
<BR>
definition of art -- i.e., &quot;Art is what artists or the art establishment say
<BR>
is art, objectivity be damned!&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, I don't really think that &quot;great art&quot; and &quot;art&quot; are really the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same type of animal at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  Great art is a type of art judged by its quality.  (Judgment
<BR>
can also be, to some extent, freed from tastes.  If I judge an art work, I
<BR>
can still think it's great, yet not like it.  I can also like a particular
<BR>
work, yet not think it's great.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, I don't know what art is anymore.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I thought I knew, but something dribbled out, and that something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was the knowing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now you're just sounding silly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is anticipated that not all people are equipped with, or desire to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equipped with, the interface necessary to be impacted by and discerning
</EM><BR>
of,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; art.  I doubt such an interface confers any practical advantage, except in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; briefly barely slightly lightly passing.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is pure elitism.  I disagree completely.  In every human culture we
<BR>
know of, there is art.  Not everyone is an artist or a good judge of art.
<BR>
Not everyone is a good chef or a dietician.  This does not mean good
<BR>
nutrition is totally subjective.  I think the need for art is a basic human
<BR>
need, though a psychological not physical need, else we would have cultures
<BR>
without art.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For this reason, I suspect many will not/never concern themselves with art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I can't objectively see any reason why this is a &quot;bad thing.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.  Almost everyone has art in their lives.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Conversely, possession of such an interface does allow one to participate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with reality on a different level, with subsequent subjective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blessings/curses.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think there is some special interface here.  I don't think there are
<BR>
a few enlightened ones who can have the power to perceive art, while the
<BR>
rest muddle in the dark groping.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Also, there's no reason to talk about Extropian or transhumanist art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not really sure what &quot;transhuman&quot; art is, frankly.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but if one can't tell what art is, then,
<BR>
logically, Extropian or transhumanist art would also be undefineable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Why would emotions run so high if it were only that?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who knows?  We seem to think it's important.
</EM><BR>
<P>But why?  Why would it be important?  I think it's because it scratches a
<BR>
deep itch.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
