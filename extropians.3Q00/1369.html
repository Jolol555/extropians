<P><EM>&gt; Is this gibing really all that needs to be said, in reply to the concern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that remixing genes in ways not pre-tested by millennia of  natural (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indeed human) selection and broadcasting them everywhere in industrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantities might have horrible consequences? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Your concern is noted Damien.  However look at it from the perspective
<BR>
of the protein folding problem -- genes produce these funny little
<BR>
proteins that have very specific shapes and functions.  I would
<BR>
imagine that the probability that our inter-species transfers producing
<BR>
some dangerous combination is so vanishingly low that it falls way
<BR>
below the probability of the interspecies transfers that nature
<BR>
does every day will cause a problem.  In other words, our activities
<BR>
are (thus far) likely to be noise in the system.  I've got plans
<BR>
that will change that but I've got plans for failsafes as well.
<BR>
<P>The best example I can think of for human created problems is
<BR>
chemicals similar to hormones (dioxins and their ilk).  The situation
<BR>
here is that you are only dealing with a few dozen atoms that happen
<BR>
to have a similar enough shape to molecules nature has chosen to use
<BR>
for signals, that false signals are received or valid signals are blocked.
<BR>
<P>Once you bump up the size and shape of the molecules (to proteins)
<BR>
the probability of unanticipated reactions should decrease significantly.
<BR>
<P>Its like asking if you have 40 random things pulled out of the
<BR>
drawers in your home and I go to another draw and pull something out
<BR>
and add it to the pile of 40 things, do I get a bomb?  There is probably
<BR>
some combination of things in your home that will produce a bomb but
<BR>
my chances of discovering the right combinations by accident are very
<BR>
very low.
<BR>
<P>Another analogy would be -- what is the proability if you pick an
<BR>
average man or woman off of the street and spend a day with them
<BR>
that you would actually enjoy the experience enough to want to mate
<BR>
with them and produce offspring?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even without a brain, a scarecrow might notice some of the nasty field
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effects mentioned in Greg's cautionary post about spreading anthropogenic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chemical novelties into the biosystem (hormone analogues poisoning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developmental pathways, etc etc).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but the hormone analogues are products of the chemical industries,
<BR>
not the AgBio industry.  If you want to balance the debate you need
<BR>
to discuss how many new chemical molecules are invented each year
<BR>
(some of which must surely escape into the environment -- something
<BR>
the Greens are starting to notice vis-a-vis the drug industry) vs.
<BR>
how many new organisms are produced and released?
<BR>
<P>Lord, what kind of studies were done on the effects of Viagra
<BR>
flowing into the water supply of animals or even humans?
<BR>
The mind boggles...
