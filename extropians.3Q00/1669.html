ELF Targets GE Research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories
<BR>
<P>Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island - On Thursday July 13, the Earth 
<BR>
Liberation Front (E.L.F) claimed responsibility for anti-biotech 
<BR>
direct actions at the Cold Spring Harbor
<BR>
Laboratories in Long Island, New York, the first known incidents of 
<BR>
such action in that state. Under the cover of night and by pale 
<BR>
moonlight the activists evaded security and destroyed two acres of 
<BR>
gmo corn and several greenhouses worth of seedlings. They also 
<BR>
monkeywrenched several trucks, and spray painted anti-genetic 
<BR>
messages everywhere. In so doing it is estimated that two years of 
<BR>
genetic experiments were destroyed.
<BR>
<P>CSHL is notorious as a hundred-year old institution that has 
<BR>
pioneered the science of genetic engineering. Its labs are 
<BR>
responsible for research related to  the &quot;discovery of hybrid vigor 
<BR>
(which) led to increased corn production and to a revolution in crop 
<BR>
breeding&quot;-- now more commonly known as &quot;the green revolution&quot; and 
<BR>
identified by thousands of activists and scholars from the Global 
<BR>
South, as a root cause of the starvation and depletion of soil and 
<BR>
biodiversity occurring at breakneck pace around the planet.
<BR>
<P>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories and the Watson School of Biological 
<BR>
Sciences are key components in &quot;the life-sciences industry&quot;, where 
<BR>
the natural evolution of organisms are dissected, manipulated to fit 
<BR>
the demands of the market, and profited from by huge 
<BR>
agro-chemical-pharmaceutical-genetic conglomerates such as Monsanto, 
<BR>
DowChemical, and Celera. Regardless of the non-profit nature of 
<BR>
CSHL, the research conducted there in the name of modern progress 
<BR>
only serves to deepen the crisis in human health, agriculture, and 
<BR>
biodiversity. The quest for funding and thirst for more knowledge 
<BR>
that drives the science industry toward a redesigning of life, rather 
<BR>
than researching solutions based on ecological sustainability and 
<BR>
respect for the limits of our earth's life support systems, are 
<BR>
arrogant and dangerous.
<BR>
<P>Searching for super-technological solutions to problems caused by 
<BR>
capitalist exploitation and industrialism, does a great disservice to 
<BR>
the future of humanity, by ignoring the reciprocal, and highly 
<BR>
probable effects of tampering with basic life processes. Direct 
<BR>
Actionists have demonstrated that they believe in going beyond the 
<BR>
legally sanctioned forms of protest, to draw attention to the grave 
<BR>
dangers facing society that are rarely challenged.
