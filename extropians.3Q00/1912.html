<P><EM>&gt;I read your paper &quot;Dreams of Autarky&quot;, and found the arguments quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plausible.  ...  I think I'm agreeing with you when I say that it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be due to an unfamiliarity with the economic point of view in many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;otherwise farsighted people.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well you're not disagreeing :-).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;One point you've made before that I thought was underemphasized as a part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this constellation of effects is the expectation among the proponents of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;autarkies that someone will achieve the breakthrough far in advance on one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these fronts.  Not only are we interdependent for our economy, we're also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interdependent for inventions and discovery.
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess I didn't emphasize it as much because the case isn't quite as strong
<BR>
here, though it is reasonably strong.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;...  Are there other development paths that occur to you which could lead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to increasing our commerce with space?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really.  Space basically offers volume, matter, and energy, which we have
<BR>
plenty of down here to last us quite a while.  A little more would be nice,
<BR>
but not nice enough I think to be worth the huge costs of dealing with space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I also had a reaction to your discussion of Crypto Credentials, though this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably more of a tangent.  I haven't ever believed that Chaumian blind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;credentials were plausible in any near future.  I have hoped we could find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more conventional ways to separate information about different facets of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lives.  Right now, the US government promotes tighter integration of all these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facets by ensuring everyone has a common identifier (SSN) ...  If different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facets of our lives weren't artificially made more accessible behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consumer's backs, they could do a better job of preventing employers from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;finding out irrelevant facts, or at least know when it's happening so social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pressure could effect the outcomes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that as usual the government is pushing in the wrong direction, but
<BR>
even if they were out of the picture I still wouldn't be optimistic.
