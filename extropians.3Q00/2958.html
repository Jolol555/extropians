<P>
For another look at the future challenges to IP, see
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000813mag-boombox.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000813mag-boombox.html</A>.

(US people can register for free.  Try cpunks/cpunks if you like.)
<BR>
<P>This talks about TiVo and Replay, the new &quot;personal video recorders&quot;
<BR>
which save TV shows on disk and let you watch them whenever you like.
<BR>
The article predicts that these things will be the same kind of threat
<BR>
to TV that Napster is to the music business.  The problem is, these
<BR>
systems allow you to skip past commercials.  If they catch on, the whole
<BR>
financial basis for the TV industry would be in jeapordy.
<BR>
<P>The article goes on to suggest that the solution ultimately will
<BR>
be advertising so targetted that people will _want_ to see the ads.
<BR>
The only way for this to work is for the advertisers (or at least some
<BR>
part of the advertisement-delivering machinery) to know a lot about your
<BR>
tastes and preferences.  TiVo and similar systems might allow this kind
<BR>
of information gathering.
<BR>
<P>Theoretically, everyone wins.  Advertisers present their ads to people
<BR>
who are maximally receptive to their message, and viewers see ads about
<BR>
the very products they are most interested in.
<BR>
<P>However there seem to be flaws in this tidy picture.  If people really
<BR>
want to see the ads, why should the advertisers pay for expensive TV
<BR>
programming to wrap around them?  Normally the only way they can get you
<BR>
to watch ads is by putting them in shows.  If you actually liked the ads,
<BR>
there's no reason for the advertisers to pay for the shows.
<BR>
<P>Also, as the article mentions, much advertising doesn't fit into this
<BR>
model.  Everyone buys toilet paper, but most people aren't going to be
<BR>
eager to see ads for it.  The nature of advertising may change as only
<BR>
certain kinds of products can be presented in an appealing way.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if the industry will try to pass some kind of laws to preserve
<BR>
the status quo in the same way that the music and movie people have done.
