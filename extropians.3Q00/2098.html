<P>Scott Ive argued long that robots could be built to do things
<BR>
such as this, but lately Ive had some second thoughts.  I still
<BR>
think robots *could* do things like this, however humans might
<BR>
make fairly good low cost robots.  Actually we use them for
<BR>
that purpose now, when you think about it: push line electronics
<BR>
manufacturing for instance.  We have a loooot of people we
<BR>
dont know what to do with as it is.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, there are definitely issues yet to be worked.  The
<BR>
mechanical details are relatively easy.  I am quietly watching
<BR>
the napster debates, and what to do with the question of how
<BR>
to pay the artists.
<BR>
<P>Do allow me to toss in my two cents.  When the nanoschmooze
<BR>
was going on here in May, Damien Broderick was staying at my place
<BR>
and he was working on an updated version of The Spike.  One
<BR>
passage had a couple of paragraphs covering a topic on which I have
<BR>
modest expertise, prime numbers.  We updated those two
<BR>
paragraphs using the latest from GIMPS, etc.  Damien and I
<BR>
did a *ton* of calculations, polished, debated, researched on
<BR>
the web, polished more, calculated some more, and by the time he
<BR>
had rewritten *two paragraphs* into three, two grown men had spent
<BR>
over two hours.  The entire book has things like that in it.  So
<BR>
get that book, and read it.
<BR>
<P>Please, napster fans, how do we motivate people to do things
<BR>
like writing The Spike if their blood, sweat and tears can so
<BR>
easily be copied free?  How much thought do you put into
<BR>
your extropian posts?  Very little if you are anything like me.
<BR>
Would you want books that were no higher quality than what
<BR>
we read on our chat groups?  Have any of you chat groups
<BR>
that are *not* brainy ones like extropians?  I do: a motorcycle
<BR>
enthusiasts group.  The writing there is so poor and the thoughts
<BR>
so shallow it is scarcely worth the effort to hit the delete key on
<BR>
most of them.  Is our literary future to be like that?  Napster fans?
<BR>
