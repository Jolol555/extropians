<EM>&gt; way to do this which I think is within current or nearly-current technology. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I came up with this idea several years ago but just realized it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propogandistic value today: genetically engineer a strain of grass (common 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lawn grass) which produces THC, and other chemicals found in marijuana.

<EM>&gt; Immediately, many of the people (from the left side of the anti-GM spectrum) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who are now protesting GM food suddenly can grow their favorite drug, right

<EM>&gt; in their front lawn, without arousing detection. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you any idea how dangerous that proposal is?
<BR>
<P>There's some evidence that hemp evolved the metabolic pathways that
<BR>
synthesize THC as a defense against herbivores. It turns out that cattle
<BR>
really *hate* getting stoned so they rapidly learn to eat something else.
<BR>
<P>In hemp, this isn't a problem (except for us whacky humans who like the
<BR>
stuff). But grass is the staple foodstuff for the cattle we eat. It's also
<BR>
worth remembering that most of our staple food crops -- things we eat 
<BR>
directly, like wheat -- are grasses.
<BR>
<P>Given that gene transfer _does_ occur, if you start packaging up THC
<BR>
synthesis in a neat, transferrable plasmid or whatever, designed for
<BR>
implanting in grass, you risk infecting our core foodstuffs. This is
<BR>
not clever.
<BR>
<P>(Now, if you could find something a bit less critical to our food chain --
<BR>
orange or apple trees, say -- this might be a runner.)
<BR>
<P>The point is, when considering a GM deployment it's important to bear
<BR>
in mind the worst possible side-effects. Because your mistakes replicate.
