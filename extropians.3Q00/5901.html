&quot;Spudboy&quot; writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Please do not be decieved by the name National Socialist. My guess is that the
</EM><BR>
Party name Nationalist Party, founded immediately after WW1 and also a
<BR>
Racist-Nordic myth party, funded by the autocrats and the industrial
<BR>
chieftans--their leader, if I remember correctly was Hugenburg. The National
<BR>
Socialists had nothing to do with socialism (despite the many flaws of
<BR>
socialism) it was just a way of packaging their hatreds while avoiding the
<BR>
&quot;copyright infringements&quot; of the larger competing racist, National Party. Hitler
<BR>
loaded his pockets down and was a capitalist in the sense that he wanted to make
<BR>
a profit. He was absolutely not a free-enterprise capitalist. The shopkeepers
<BR>
that supported him were also capitalists too. Hope this helps.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>In case you missed it, here is the lowdown on Hitler's National Socialism in the
<BR>
words of Michael Lorrey:
<BR>
<P>That german
<BR>
industrialists paid kickbacks they were forced to pay at gunpoint or otherwise
<BR>
does not make Nazis capitalists, any more than Jiang Zemin is a capitalist. They
<BR>
are looters-in-chief, and socialists at heart.
<BR>
<P>He is living the same socialist lie that claims that Nazis were capitalists, and
<BR>
soviet communism was state capitalism.
<BR>
<P>What we are 'hip' to is that socialists will continuously try to re-invent
<BR>
themselves, repaint their horse, change their names, invent new catch phrases,
<BR>
and deny that the con they are selling today has anything to do with the con
<BR>
they were shoving down people's throats yesterday at gun point. What we are
<BR>
'hip' to is that anarcho-capitalist free markets are quite as capable of
<BR>
maximizing freedom for the most people possible as any other system, and far
<BR>
better than most, including socialism. A social democracy is not a liberal
<BR>
democracy, no matter how much you try to insist it is so. One decrys the
<BR>
individual, the other celebrates it.
