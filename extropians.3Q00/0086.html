<EM>&gt; Shouldn't you be off working, rather than wasting productive time posting to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this list?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How many dollars have you forgone just by reading this post?

<P>I am currently stuck in Germany waiting for various bureaucracies to
<BR>
stumble to conclusion, can't do much besides watch my stocks appreciate
<BR>
and think up new ideas. Sorry you have to deal with my higher-than-average
<BR>
posting for another week or two.
<BR>
<P>Besides if I can get you all to think a bit more about your situations
<BR>
perhaps you all will make more money and contribute to causes I am
<BR>
interested in.
<BR>
<P>And lastly, I have already made plenty of dollars... sure I want more, but
<BR>
for now the money can work for me and grow while I work on figuring out
<BR>
the best ways to spend it. Any real work I do from now on will be of my
<BR>
choosing.
