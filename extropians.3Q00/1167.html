I missed who Damien was quoting here:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I usually try to avoid strong language, but the phrase &quot;total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bullshit&quot; comes to mind.  Deterministic is deterministic.  It's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computer.  Everything inside the box is deterministic.  It doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter how complex their random-number algorithm is; unless they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually have a radioactive isotope in there, it's deterministic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, radioactivity is not necessary.  There are other
<BR>
nondeterministic sources of noise in nature.  Thermal noise can be
<BR>
detected via a reverse biased diode or similar components.  Thermal noise
<BR>
is deterministic in a Newtonian universe, but in practice the molecular
<BR>
motions that cause the noise will be affected by the uncertainty principle
<BR>
and so will partake of quantum randomness.
<BR>
<P>Some newer computers include a component from Intel which is a true random
<BR>
number generator chip based on thermal noise.  It is part of their bus
<BR>
control chip.  I'm not sure exactly how this RNG is used by Windows in the
<BR>
installed state, but it would certainly be possible to have a program that
<BR>
would use bits from this chip as true random bits for psi experiments.
<BR>
<P>Damien wrote:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I take it what's being said here is this: even if the sloppiness of Windows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes the sampled data *unpredictable* to a human, nonetheless they occur
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a deterministic sequence that is set in ineluctable motion from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moment the seed enters the algorithm. This would be good enough for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; precognition experiment, say, but not for one of mental *influence*.
</EM><BR>
<P>Interestingly, this would suggest that it would be possible for a
<BR>
psychic to distinguish a true-random source from a deterministic,
<BR>
pseudo-random one.  This is thought to be impossible if certain number
<BR>
theory problems are hard, like factoring.  Of course, factoring would
<BR>
not be hard for psychics; they could just guess the factors a bit at
<BR>
a time, using some of the noise-reducing techniques.  They could also
<BR>
break ciphers by guessing keys.
<BR>
<P>This is the kind of test which I'd like to see: generate a crypto key,
<BR>
encrypt a message, then destroy the key.  See if the psychics can
<BR>
guess the decryption key and decrypt the message.  There'd still be a
<BR>
possibility of cheating, but if the generation and destruction were done
<BR>
in some kind of public manner, psychics all over the world could spend
<BR>
as much time as necessary to get the answer.
