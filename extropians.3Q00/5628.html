<EM>&gt; Huh?  I wasn't using &quot;greatest&quot; in respect to budget or size of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development team (although I think both will be greater than you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think).  I was using it in terms of the criticality of this project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You continuously tell us it is our only hope.  It is difficult to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagine a project much &quot;greater&quot; than that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, so why would I necessarily need more than a finite and limited amount of
<BR>
charisma to handle that?  If I needed incredibly skilled and talented hackers
<BR>
to act as janitors, then yes, I (or someone) would need a lot of charisma. 
<BR>
But attracting people to the most important job in the entire world?  How much
<BR>
leadership talent do you need for *that*?
<BR>
<P>Actually herding the cats once you've got them, now, that's another issue. 
<BR>
So's PR.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think that is a highly questionable attitude.  I do not believe that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even yourself &quot;got it&quot; on the first try.  Nor do I believe the evolution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the idea is complete and finished for anyone to get in one try.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frankly I think this part of your thinking is dangerously immature.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a difference between Getting It and getting everything right on the
<BR>
first try (see below).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I wish I knew more about dealing with people, but I no longer give it as high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a priority as I once did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How can that be anything but a mistake when you require people, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are the only intelligences to use in getting this thing off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ground, and their resources in order to produce the Seed?
</EM><BR>
<P>My purpose, above all else, is to design the Seed.  Other people can
<BR>
persuade.  I have to complete the design.  If being charismatic requires
<BR>
patterns of thought that interfere with my ability to complete the design, or
<BR>
even if it starts taking up too much time, then forget charismatic.  I'll stay
<BR>
in the basement and someone else will be charismatic instead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that all of those you need will just automatically think enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like you or agree enough with your conclusions that little/no effort is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessary on your part to understand and deal with them further?   What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of model leads you to this conclusion?
</EM><BR>
<P>Past experience, actually.  The people I need seem to Get It on the first try,
<BR>
generally speaking.  I'm not saying that they don't argue with me, or that
<BR>
they don't ask questions.  Mitchell Porter has been right where I have been
<BR>
wrong, on a major issue, on at least two separate occasions.
<BR>
<P>The difference is pretty hard to put into words.  I am not the judge of who is
<BR>
or isn't asking &quot;intelligent questions&quot;, and that's not what I'm trying to
<BR>
say.  What I'm trying to say rather is that there is a pattern.  Mitchell
<BR>
Porter groks the pattern; if he says, &quot;Eliezer, you're flat wrong about X&quot;,
<BR>
then at least we're both arguing within the same pattern.  People who Get It
<BR>
may agree or disagree with me, but they understand the pattern.  Rarely, if
<BR>
ever, do I see someone who didn't get the pattern suddenly get it after long
<BR>
and acrimonious argument; the only person I can ever recall seeing do that is
<BR>
Eric Watt Forste, which still impresses me.
