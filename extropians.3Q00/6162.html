<EM>&gt;  &gt; I do remember back that far.  Not remembering that is not a universal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; trait.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would not put any faith in fidelity of such supposed reminiscences,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as (told in a recent paper which name I can't recall) adults tend to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confabulate childhood memories. I've always suspected that much, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's nice to see it proven -- hopefully, I haven't confabulated that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper, too ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>I remember hearing that in Psych A01.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lucky modern kids, they can record every single minute of their lives,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in principle. The technology is there, albeit still a bit expensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and cumbersome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Nope.  The gap between human adult and SI is many orders of magnitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; greater.  But I don't see a sound argument here for assuming that the
</EM><BR>
SI
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; could not understand in principle.
</EM><BR>
<P>It wasn't really supposed to be a strong argument, just a bit of random
<BR>
conjecture to ponder as we stagger onwards into the great misty future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Probably, for the same reason we can understand a virus, at least in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principle, if knowing its and it's context's full molecular structure.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure of your point here Eugene; if you mean that knowing someone's
<BR>
molecular structure does not mean that you understand them, then I would
<BR>
concur.
