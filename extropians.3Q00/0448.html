<EM>&gt; Like evolutionary theory, psychology is in desperate need of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mathematical models, or failing that, at least some kind of objective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metrics.  For instance, if someone is depressed, we need some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of device or machine to measure how depressed....
</EM><BR>
<P>I was about to respond about how there aren't agreed models of what
<BR>
to measure, but I think Spike gets that.  It's worse than that,
<BR>
actually, short of MRI scans, I don't think we know anything that we
<BR>
CAN measure, and we don't have a baseline for understanding
<BR>
individual differences yet, even if we get better brain-scanning in
<BR>
the near future.
<BR>
<P>My original career choice was psychotherapy, and I didn't drop out
<BR>
until the colleagues and the establishment that I was going to have
<BR>
to work with in grad school started driving me crazy because of the
<BR>
very poor scientific standards and very high hubris levels.
<BR>
<P>Presently, we can administer tests like the MMPI (Minnesota
<BR>
Multiphasic Personality Inventory) or whatever, but interperting them
<BR>
is subjective.  They really don't test that some condition exists,
<BR>
they test how you respond to the test.   And we are sort of stuck
<BR>
treating the problem as a black box because there just aren't any
<BR>
biochemical diagnostic tools in the field yet. There could well be
<BR>
several distinct syndromes that present as &quot;depression,&quot; but have
<BR>
different underlying pathology.
<BR>
<P>I've both read the studies on EMDR and had it 'done to me' by a
<BR>
trained practitioner.  When it works, it's pretty impressive.  EMDR
<BR>
and NLP both seem to work by tapping the underlying suggestability
<BR>
mechanism behind hypnosis.   This somehow strikes me as deeply
<BR>
primitive, but we don't have theory to get us beyond it, and there's
<BR>
some reason to believe that to the extent you are convinced that
<BR>
you've changed, you have changed.  I felt very cynical (when not
<BR>
hubristic) as I was trying to learn that stuff.  It's almost a
<BR>
religious sort of thing as opposed to a scientific one.   I resent
<BR>
having to work blind, with only pretty well discredited tools
<BR>
(suggestability, transference); it's enough to send me straight to the
<BR>
illness model and drugs, despite the primitive 'toss this spanner in
<BR>
the works' state of drug therapy.
<BR>
<P>I was a big Laing fan in high school.
<BR>
<P>Extropian content: Understanding the mind/brain better, in particular
<BR>
the process of rationality, and the normal, healthy, functioning of
<BR>
the emotions, is the only way we are ever going to have satisfactory
<BR>
therapies for mental health issues.   There's just too much evidence
<BR>
that whatever the causes are, the syndromes are physiological, and
<BR>
I'm convinced that some of the things that need to be fixed are more
<BR>
complex than we can deal with with simple drugs.
