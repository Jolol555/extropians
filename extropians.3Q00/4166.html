Daniel Ust has seen fit to provide these comments:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; If &quot;reality = all that exists&quot; isn't axiomatic, but rather a universal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truth,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; that's okay with me.  I just think of it as a definition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The above equality is a definition, not an axiom.  &quot;Reality is real&quot; is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; axiom.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, that's the way I see it too.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's a difference between self-evident and obvious or well known.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Self-evident means something that gives evidence for itself.  Axioms and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; axiomatic concepts are like that.  They give evidence for themselves -- to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be aware of them requires mere awareness and conceptualizing from that; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deny them involves contradiction.  Obvious means something which something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we need not debate -- and this definitely depends on context.  Tensor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calculus is obvious to the GTR crowd, but not to, say, your average person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well known is much the same.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'll stay with your previous comment that it's a definition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree here, though such obvious facts often need to be backed up by more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than just pointing out they are obvious.  To fail to do so often invites bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy in.
</EM><BR>
<P>Someone should have told me that when I questioned my first grade teacher about
<BR>
*why* 2 + 2 = 4.
<BR>
But then I was too young to read _Principia Mathematica_ anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But none of this seems to answer Jason's original concern.  (I still have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few posts to catch up on, but now I must leave your reality temporarily...:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps he misread the definition of reality as a description of reality. His
<BR>
concern seems to revolve around the idea that everyone has a right to their own
<BR>
version of reality or what is real. This in turn happens when one does not
<BR>
differentiate between a *version* of reality (which means something that is not
<BR>
quite reality) and what the word reality actually means. The fact that a belief
<BR>
in multiple &quot;realities&quot; is irrational doesn't matter to someone whose primary
<BR>
concern is that everyone should have the right to live in their own separate
<BR>
reality if they so choose. I have no problem with that. Just don't ask me to
<BR>
call it sane.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Every man has a sane spot somewhere.&quot;
