<P>Heck.  They're here now.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you think you can fight religion? And win?

<EM>&gt; You're talking about the &quot;Artilect Wars&quot; all over again. But this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dirty, Vietnam-style war.... where people defend their God-given &quot;right&quot; to

<EM>&gt; create God with a seething, righteous passion. Should be fun if you're into

<P>Good point.  I've thought a few times about starting a sci-tech based
<BR>
and very friendly religion.  Pull in some favored causes like having
<BR>
information be a holy sacrament that must be shared freely.  &quot;We answer
<BR>
to a Higher Source.&quot;  Maybe religious citadels that are data havens. 
<BR>
Have church tithes and &quot;love offerings&quot; go to fund various open source
<BR>
and other high tech projects.  All proceeds from same freely shared with
<BR>
all members of course. And all proceeds and such R&amp;D organizations would
<BR>
in theory be immune to taxation.  It could be really good fun.  Even (or
<BR>
perhaps especially) if I am utterly serious about such things.
