during the cold war if we did not fear their nuclear missiles?  Would

there have even been a cold war?  Why do you think they are so afraid of

our having missile defenses, and want to limit them?  They know that an

effective defense against their missiles leaves them nothing but a

over-educated third world country.

<P>And do you think that a &quot;rogue nation&quot; would even bother to *start* the

hideously expensive process of building missiles to begin with if they

suspected that they might not work once done?  They can be fairly certian

of *their* expertise, but what of ours?  Do they really know?  The U.S.

performs technological miracles on a regular basis.   If you are the head

of a weapons developement program, would you bet your life on it

(literally, in many nations)?

the enemy before a shot is ever fired...
