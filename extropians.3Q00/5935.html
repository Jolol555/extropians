Thanks to Andrew Ducker for the following.
<BR>
<P>SINGLE-MOLECULE STM CHEMISTRY. The versatility and exactitude of the scanning
<BR>
tunneling microscope (STM) is demonstrated in a new experiment at the Free
<BR>
University of Berlin, where scientists have for the first time manipulated
<BR>
single molecules to perform a complete chemical reaction. Saw-Wai Hla
<BR>
(011-49-30-838-52-813) and his colleagues start with several iodobenzene (C6H5I)
<BR>
molecules resting on a terraced copper substrate. Then they dissociate some of
<BR>
the molecules into iodine and phenyl (C6H5) by injecting electrons from the STM
<BR>
tip. Next the iodine atoms are herded up and moved away with the STM tip. Now
<BR>
the tip pulls one phenyl close to another; they are not yet chemically bonded,
<BR>
though: pulling on one phenyl does not bring the other one along. Finally,
<BR>
another splash of electrons from the tip effectively welds the two phenyls
<BR>
together; proof that binding occurs is that when one phenyl is pulled with the
<BR>
tip, the other comes along for the ride (see a drawing of this sequence at
<BR>
Physics News Graphics.
<BR>
<P>In summary, the making of C12H10 molecules from C6H5I molecules, normally
<BR>
carried out on a copper catalyst and using thermal activation (a process
<BR>
chemists call the Ullmann reaction), has here been forced to proceed by
<BR>
employing one molecule at a time at a cryogenic temperature of 20 K. The
<BR>
researchers believe that new manmade molecules, never before seen in nature, can
<BR>
be engineered in this way, including the selective detachment or replacement of
<BR>
parts of larger molecules for individual assembling of molecular based
<BR>
nano-devices.
