<P>
Samantha Atkins hazards,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the AI is in fact as much of an autonomous intelligent being as you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself are then deletion of the AI is just as much an execution/murder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as is the same act performed on you or I.
</EM><BR>
<P>The difference is that no one in any position of power is prepared to grant
<BR>
voting rights to an AI, let alone full status as an entity protected by laws
<BR>
against murder. If we can draft young men and send them to their death in combat
<BR>
during wartime, we surely will not flinch at deleting a recalcitrant AI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we insist on treating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beings as bright and adaptive as ourselves as things that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percipitate a human-AI conflict very quickly.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, if we treat AIs as disposable and expendable, that will insure
<BR>
their compliance and user friendliness (just as similar treatment of GIs insures
<BR>
their obedience and compliance). As a female, you may have insufficient
<BR>
appreciation for the &quot;do or die&quot; situation of the male of the species.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to
<BR>
make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being
<BR>
can fight and never stop fighting.&quot; -e.e. cummings
<BR>
