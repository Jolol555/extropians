<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the golden question is - can we really survive one of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plagues, let
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone dozens of them?  And if a few of us did manage to survive, would it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter?  Would there be any modern civilization left?  Would the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ambition become a bygone fantasy no longer capable of being pursued in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical manner?
</EM><BR>
<P>In the past, epidemics caused by virulent pathogens newly introduced into
<BR>
human populations have tended to play out within a human generation due to a
<BR>
couple of factors.  One factor is the evolution of the pathogen into a form
<BR>
which is nonlethal to the host, the second being that the pathogen kills
<BR>
susceptible individuals, leaving the population as a whole resistant. My
<BR>
present understanding of molecular genetics doesn't lead me to believe that
<BR>
the process of natural selection would fail due to the presence of alien
<BR>
genes, so I would expect epidemics of the near future to follow the same
<BR>
course as their historical predecessors. However, during the generation when
<BR>
the pathogen is at its most lethal, past civilations have changed beyond
<BR>
recognition.
<BR>
<P>There are other challenges facing us in addition to the risk of disease
<BR>
epidemic. These include the wide-spread destruction of top soil,
<BR>
historically positively correlated with the fall of civilizations; dwindling
<BR>
amounts of easily extractable petroleum; and the cultural weariness of an
<BR>
over-mature civilization. One of the things I like about the Extropians is
<BR>
their determined sense of optimism, but I sometimes sense that it's being
<BR>
purchased at the price of denial of the magnitude of the changes we'll be
<BR>
dealing with in the coming 50-100 years.
<BR>
<P>A while back I read an interesting book called _How the Irish Saved
<BR>
Civilization_ about the role played by Irish monks in preserving the written
<BR>
works of the Romans as the western portion of the Empire crumbled into
<BR>
illiterate pre-feudalism (for lack of a better term). The monks hid the
<BR>
books in out of the way places, and although there was a period of time in
<BR>
which the Roman knowledge lay dormant, it was there when later generations
<BR>
were ready to appreciate it.
<BR>
<P>IMO, it would be wise for those of us who can see what may be coming to take
<BR>
steps to preserve what knowledge we can, just in case history takes the
<BR>
downhill road.  Someone recently joked about installing Eliezer in one of
<BR>
the missile silos.  Possibly in another 30 years the idea won't seem like
<BR>
such a joke after all.
