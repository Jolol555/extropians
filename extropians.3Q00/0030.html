<P>&lt;&lt; OK, I know the Nazis were into it big time, and they weren't cool dudes.  
<BR>
&nbsp;But is wanting to improve the stock a bad thing?  I have a feeling that I'm 
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;preaching to the choir&quot; when I say on this list that it seems like a good 
<BR>
&nbsp;thing to want to make humans as perfect as possible.  But it seems like 
<BR>
&nbsp;virtually everywhere else, the E word is as bad as the N word.  Why is that?

Try looking at it this way. &quot;Hi Mom and Dad! I'm porking this women to breed 
<BR>
a new germ line for the human race! One that will have high intelligence, and 
<BR>
be disease free, and have a long life-span! I told her you'd help with the 
<BR>
raising of this child, while I go off and finish college and find another 
<BR>
biologically-appropriate female to breed with. Thanks for the $500.00, and 
<BR>
I'll see you when I come home for summer break after finals. Wish me luck. 
<BR>
Love, Extropius
