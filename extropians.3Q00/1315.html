<EM>&gt; That is, my remarks were not directed to illnesses resulting from

<EM>&gt; neurochemical defects.  I am not inclined to consider these or any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other biochemical disorders as emotional illnesses. Yes, Michael, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am procrustean to the extent that I regard all psychological illness as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exclusively psychogenic, e.g. those depressions which do not respond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lithium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and similar agents.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, so now we know that when you say &quot;depression&quot;, you mean exclusively
<BR>
&quot;exogenous depression&quot;--&quot;endogenous depression&quot; is not depression at all
<BR>
but something else.
<BR>
<P>When I make a word work hard like that, I always pay it extra.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Finally, depression and suicide are weakly correlated but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coextensive. Suicide may, for example, proceed from a perfectly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rational decision to terminate a life reduced to chronic, intolerable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and incurable physical pain. Likewise note that the vast majority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of cases of depression, whether symptomatic of neurochemical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defects, situational reactions or psychoneuroses do not result in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suicide.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I never said they were coextensive--and the word you used was &quot;never&quot;.
<BR>
Funny how the DSM lists &quot;suicidal ideation&quot; as one of the indicia for
<BR>
depression. But then, they're using the wrong definition and you're
<BR>
using the right one.
<BR>
<P>Or to recast what I take to be your view: healthy people can get
<BR>
depressed, but not enough to kill themselves, because if they're
<BR>
healthy, it's exogenous and &quot;psychogenic&quot;. If you're suicidal, you're
<BR>
probably just vindictive, or possibly have an out-of-whack chemistry,
<BR>
but you're not depressed. You're just what laymen and incompetent
<BR>
doctors *call* depressed.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There's glory for you.&quot;  --H. Dumpty
