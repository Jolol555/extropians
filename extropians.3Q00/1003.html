<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like some considered comments on this site and these instances of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claims of paranormal perception achieved by a specific practical protocol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (remote viewing), developed for the formerly classified STARGATE project.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see enough at this site to come to any conclusion other than
<BR>
&quot;interesting...&quot;
<BR>
<P>However, the info on this site is consistent with what I've heard and read
<BR>
elsewhere about remote viewing experiments. If the experimental data
<BR>
reported are true, you have to admit that there's something going on that
<BR>
doesn't fit into generally accepted explanations of conscisouness.
<BR>
<P>It's unfortunate that the astrology stuff is included.  I think sometimes
<BR>
people operating on the fringes like this go over the edge in an attempt to
<BR>
bring in some money.
<BR>
<P>There's a pretty interesting site on psi studies at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~ursa/philos/psi.htm">http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~ursa/philos/psi.htm</A>   Here's a paragraph from
<BR>
Peter Lloyd's personal background page:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I was born in 1960 and grew up in the old port town of Cardiff. In 1979 I
<BR>
entered the University College in Cardiff, to study computer systems, but
<BR>
switched to mathematics. After graduating in 1981, I spent six years
<BR>
carrying out research in the solar engineering department of the university.
<BR>
At that time, I was working on the mathematical modelling of the incidence
<BR>
of solar energy -- a mix of software development and number crunching. In
<BR>
1987, the UK government declined to fund any further research in solar
<BR>
energy. So, I left. I moved to Oxford, where I worked as a software
<BR>
developer for a research group, under Richard Peto, conducting clinical
<BR>
trials. This also gave me the opportunity to attend evening classes in
<BR>
philosophy, under Dr Michael Lockwood. At the end 1993, I left Oxford and
<BR>
went freelance as a software developer.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The guy's mathematical background shows--no bullshit, logical analysis of
<BR>
what's been done so far and what are the shortcomings apparent in the
<BR>
published research.
<BR>
<P>Charles Tart also has written some interesting papers, such as this one
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.paradigm-sys.com/cttart/sci-docs/ctt78-pfaas.html">http://www.paradigm-sys.com/cttart/sci-docs/ctt78-pfaas.html</A>
<BR>
<P>His research has been criticized, and I have to agree that much of his psi
<BR>
research is no more than anecdotal (it's still interesting though). I've
<BR>
been favorably impressed by some of his research into altered states of
<BR>
consciousness.
