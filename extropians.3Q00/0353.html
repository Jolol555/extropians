<EM>&gt;I couldn't get past the Introduction, where that vastly overrated book

<EM>&gt;claims &quot;gold plates&quot; as its source. It also refers to these as &quot;sheets of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;metal,&quot; &quot;metal record plates,&quot; and &quot;Plates of Brass.&quot; So, whatever happened 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to these mythical &quot;metal plates&quot;? Why, &quot;the messenger called for them... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and he has them in his charge until this day.&quot; How convenient! This leaves 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the dispassionate observer with absolutely no evidence to contradict an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intuition that the entire Book sprang from the fevered brain of a misfit. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This vastly overrated book has nothing to do with extropy, and everything 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do with wasting paper, ink, and other resources, including the minds of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children and the bandwidth of the Net.

<P>I tried to read it in middle school and had the same reaction - I found some 
<BR>
interesting things in the bible, and there's debate about how much of 
<BR>
biblical stories are somewhat based in reality - some of the debate is 
<BR>
legitimate. As for the Book Of Mormon.. it's stunningly fraudulent, and not 
<BR>
at all interesting as fiction. Nothing in it synchronizes with anything we 
<BR>
know about history, botany, or the anthropology of the Americas. Here is a 
<BR>
brief article about some of the mistakes in it:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nowscape.com/mormon/zindler1.htm">http://www.nowscape.com/mormon/zindler1.htm</A>
<BR>
Also note that there's some translation mistakes in the King James version 
<BR>
of the Bible - there are some Bible passages in the Book Of Mormon, and 
<BR>
every translation mistake is carried over.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;John Clarke was I believe discussing the Bible and NOT the mormon cripture 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;known as The Book of Mormon!  Again, on my mission people would ask if the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;golden plates which had the original Book of Mormon text on them were in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Utah museum!  I have no problem with the idea that an angel of God took 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them back when the translation was finished.  The attempts to steal them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and kill Smith were many as he translated.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe his wife at the time stole some of them. This presented a dilemma, 
<BR>
because these were the originals - if he were to re-write them, he should be 
<BR>
getting the same translation, but nobody's memory is that good - so he came 
<BR>
up with a story about how Satan influenced the original translation, and any 
<BR>
differences found between versions was due to Satan's influence.
<BR>
He also tried to tie Egypt into it somehow - there were some Egyptian 
<BR>
pictographic scripts at the time which nobody could translate. Smith, by 
<BR>
divine inspiration, was able to fill in the missing parts. Today, an 
<BR>
Egyptologist would laugh at the parts he filled in.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some say the whole NDE experience is simply caused by electro-chemical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;activity in the brain, and nothing else.  I read the web article about the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;researcher who allows people to be &quot;hooked up&quot; and experience a medically 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;induced &quot;nde.&quot;  I was not overwhelmed by the accounts and if visiting the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facility, I would tell the scientist to crank it up to FULL power!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a friend who was in a near-fatal motorcycle accident and had a NDE on 
<BR>
the road, and later in the hospital. She says she is no longer afraid of 
<BR>
dying. She also descibres a ghost who followed her throughout her house for 
<BR>
a few months when she was 16. She gave a physical description of the ghost 
<BR>
as a ashen faced 40ish man, wearing a Frank Sinatra type hat (I know there 
<BR>
is a name for that). It sounded to me like she was describing William 
<BR>
Burroughs. I showed her a picture of him and she was startled by the 
<BR>
resemblance. I know of at least 4 other people who have described a &quot;ghost&quot; 
<BR>
of the exact same appearance (all of them live in Utah). I have no 
<BR>
insightful comment on this, I just thought it was interesting. I personally 
<BR>
do not believe they were actually being trailed by a sentient entity.
