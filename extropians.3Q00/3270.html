<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<BR>
Bone marrow stem cells can become brain cells
<BR>
<P>The August 15 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience Research reported an
<BR>
exciting breakthrough funded by the Christopher Reeve Paralysis
<BR>
Foundation.  Researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of
<BR>
New Jersey have developed the first successful procedure to transform
<BR>
cultured bone marrow stromal stem cells exclusively into nerve cells, or
<BR>
neurons.  It had previously been found that the brain contains stem cells,
<BR>
which are undifferentiated immature cells, that can be coaxed into
<BR>
becoming different types of nerve cells.  However, obtaining the necessary
<BR>
stem cells for this process from deep within the brain is risky, and
<BR>
patients who receive cells cultured from donors must take
<BR>
immunosuppressive drugs to help avoid rejection.  The breakthrough
<BR>
reported this week will make available an unlimited source of one's own
<BR>
cells to treat a variety of conditions, such as spinal cord injury,
<BR>
stroke, brain trauma, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's diseases.
<BR>
<P>The study involved obtaining bone marrow stem cells from rats and humans
<BR>
and culturing them according to the researchers' protocol, using time
<BR>
lapse photography to track the cells' progression into neurons.  Specific
<BR>
gene products were confirmed that identified the transformed cells.  The
<BR>
process was accomplished in a matter of hours, and some of the neurons
<BR>
even began to form connections with other neurons.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;Now that we have been able to differentiate human bone marrow stromal
<BR>
stem cells into neurons, it creates the exciting possibility in the future
<BR>
for the treatment of neurological diseases. Research currently being
<BR>
conducted on rats with spinal paralysis suggests that stem cell
<BR>
transplants can encourage return of function,&quot; stated lead study author
<BR>
Dr. Ira Black, chair of the Department of Neurosciences at the University
<BR>
of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Robert Wood Johnson Medical
<BR>
School.
<BR>
<P>The next stage is transplantation of these nerve cells into the brain and
<BR>
spinal cord of animals.
<BR>
<P><P>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE
<BR>
Interview:  Reinventing the brain
<BR>
<P>Ever thought about growing a new brain? It may not be as far-fetched as
<BR>
you think. Dr. Fred H. Gage of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California
<BR>
has discovered baby brain cells deep inside the adult brain that can grow
<BR>
up to become new brain. His work is blowing apart the notion that a
<BR>
damaged brain or spinal cord can't be fixed. Life Extension Magazine's
<BR>
contributor, Terri Mitchell, interviews Dr. Gage:
<BR>
<P>TM:  . . .  isn't &quot;stem cell&quot; a term usually used for cells in bone marrow
<BR>
that turn into blood cells-are you saying the brain has stem cells too?
<BR>
<P>FG: They fit the criteria for stem cells, so, yes, the brain has
<BR>
undifferentiated cells that &quot;grow up&quot; to become neurons and glial cells
<BR>
and all the different cells in the brain. The discovery of these dividing
<BR>
cells helped people to overcome the idea that the brain can't make new
<BR>
neurons. The trick in understanding how the brain could make new neurons
<BR>
came with the identification in the adult brain areas where these baby
<BR>
cells persist throughout life. Before, the thinking had been that you
<BR>
couldn't replace brain cells because of all their elaborate connections
<BR>
and what they store-they're such differentiated and complex cells.
<BR>
<P>TM: What do stem cells do?
<BR>
<P>FG: A stem cell is a cell that self-renews-that means when it divides, it
<BR>
creates another stem cell and also can become a mature cell. That's one
<BR>
feature. The second feature of a stem cell is that it can turn into
<BR>
different types of brain cells. And we've proven that you can take stem
<BR>
cells out of the brain, put them in culture, transplant them back into an
<BR>
adult brain, and they'll pick up where they left off. We haven't done this
<BR>
in humans yet. But given the similarities between the work we've seen in
<BR>
animals and humans to date, I think we're confident that what we're
<BR>
dealing with is a cell that will act this way.

Foundation.
<BR>
<P><P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Trauma
<BR>
<P>Trauma may be described as a body wound or shock due to accident or
<BR>
injury. Permanent injury or death due to trauma is often caused by free
<BR>
radicals generated when the tissues of the body are physically disrupted.
<BR>
This is well-documented in spinal cord injury cases where the free-radical
<BR>
damage that occurs immediately after the injury causes permanent
<BR>
paralysis.
<BR>
<P>Antioxidants such as vitamin E, glutathione, and palm oil tocotrienols
<BR>
should immediately be administered to most victims of trauma to protect
<BR>
against free-radical injury. Trauma involving massive bleeding may
<BR>
preclude the use of antioxidants such as gingko that could accelerate
<BR>
hemorrhaging.
<BR>
<P>Protecting Against Paralysis
<BR>
<P>In laboratory studies where two groups of animals were exposed to the same
<BR>
traumatic force, animals given high doses of vitamin C died less
<BR>
frequently than animals not given vitamin C. Antioxidants appear to
<BR>
protect against many forms of permanent damage inflicted by trauma.
<BR>
<P>The hormone pregnenolone has been shown to protect against paralysis from
<BR>
spinal cord injury in laboratory animals. The immediate administration of
<BR>
400 mg of pregnenolone, along with 800 IU of vitamin E, to a spinal injury
<BR>
patient might be advisable. Vitamin E could speed the bleeding process, so
<BR>
do not use Vitamin E if excessive bleeding is occurring.

<BR>
<P>PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
<BR>
Vitamin E capsules
<BR>
<P>Vitamin E is an antioxidant which can help keep you looking younger by
<BR>
retarding cellular aging due to oxidation. It supplies oxygen to the body
<BR>
to promote endurance, works with vitamin A to protect the lungs from
<BR>
pollution, prevents and dissolves blood clots, accelerates healing, helps
<BR>
to prevent scar tissue, and lowers the risk of ischemic heart disease.
<BR>
<P>Vitamin E capsules are the dry, powder form which does not have the
<BR>
potential of turning rancid that vitamin E oil capsules have.
