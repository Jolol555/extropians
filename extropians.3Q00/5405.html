<P>&lt;&lt; Roman Catholics, so far as I know, were not welcome in the SS. Indeed, many
<BR>
&nbsp;Catholics wound up in concentration camps. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
My understanding is that since the SS racial standards was that there was to 
<BR>
be no Jewish blood in any SS man for the previous 250 years. Other then that 
<BR>
there was to be no other qualification. Both Hitler and SS Chief Himmler 
<BR>
were, at least born as Roman Catholics. Himmler was said to have used his 
<BR>
Jesuitical expericence as a young man into developing the hierarchy of the 
<BR>
SS. My guess is also that there actual philosophical orientation was a hodge 
<BR>
podge of Nordic fantasies, racism, mysticism, and hatred. The Churches of 
<BR>
that period were wont to hold their noses at such discrepencies as long as 
<BR>
the Churches could preach and proselyitze, unlike in the Soviet system.
