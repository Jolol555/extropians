<EM>&gt; Psychotherapy is bunk.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Experiment demonstrates that psychotherapy produces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; results slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worse than a control group in which patients just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talk to a random
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person for an hour.
</EM><BR>
<P>i am not familiar with the research you are referring
<BR>
to, but i am not surprised to learn of these
<BR>
experimental results after witnessing the results of
<BR>
psychotherapy on friends and acquaintances. 
<BR>
<P>what astounds me is the vast gap between the level of
<BR>
sophistication exhibited by clinical psychology and
<BR>
the psychology of advertising.  my doctoral
<BR>
dissertation, which for personal reasons i never
<BR>
completed, was on the topic of decision making under
<BR>
uncertainty.  rather than approaching the question via
<BR>
probability theory, i chose to look at the heurisitcs
<BR>
people actually use in reaching decisioins.  these
<BR>
heuristics, though sometimes useful, can at other
<BR>
times result in irrational decisions. strangely, it
<BR>
appears that people are more likely to be rational
<BR>
about small, inconsequential matters, such as what to
<BR>
eat for lunch, and to use heuristics irrationally in
<BR>
major, life-changing choices such as whom to marry.
<BR>
<P>this observation of irrational behavior led me deep
<BR>
into the field of psychology.  i quickly learned that
<BR>
in order to find the cutting-edge of theory i must
<BR>
look to the marketing and advertising journals.
<BR>
<P>I have a provisional hypothesis that there is a deeply
<BR>
imbedded fear of &quot;messing with&quot; the psyche that
<BR>
obstructs truly useful psychological research.  the
<BR>
current emphasis is on using drugs to effect changes.
<BR>
i see this as a dangerous trend if neurological
<BR>
research is not accompanied by psychological research.
<BR>
&nbsp;the effects of the drugs can be predicted in many
<BR>
cases, and yet no one actually understands *how* they
<BR>
work.
