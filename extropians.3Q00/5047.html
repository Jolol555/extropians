<BR>
<EM>&gt; Should? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, you're right Nadia.  I made a mistake in using the word &quot;should.&quot; 
<BR>
But when  discussing the normative aspects of an issue it's difficult to
<BR>
know what word to use. I suppose it would have been better to preface my
<BR>
statements with something like:  here's one possible way of doing things.
<BR>
&nbsp;This would have accurately described the atttitude I took in sharing my
<BR>
thoughts with the other list members.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the past when this topic has come up most people avoid it. 
</EM><BR>
<P>But that seems to be one of the problems--the topic's avoided in polite
<BR>
conversation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And... when someone asked if you were being antagonizing, you said 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no. Yet 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this request to legislate pregnancy is along the same lines as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asking for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete gun control. 
</EM><BR>
<P>But Nadia, it's not I who ask for legislation of anything.  I'm a
<BR>
(posthumous) student of Voltairine de Cleyre, who was known as a radical
<BR>
feminist anarchist.  Legislation of pregnancy is a fact of our current
<BR>
reality, and no doubt it will also be a fact of the near future.  I
<BR>
merely say:  given that pregnancy is and will be legislated, let us
<BR>
consider the best ways to go about legislating it.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;It is sure to get a rise out of the list. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I wanted to get a RESPONSE from the list; but I had hoped it would
<BR>
be in the form of intelligent discusssion rather than hostility.  I
<BR>
regret the way I worded my posts, and I had a feeling they'd come across
<BR>
the wrong way even shortly after making them.  Too bad I didn't have this
<BR>
insight BEFORE making them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thread will dwindle soon, since this list is predominantly male and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guys 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dislike the topic to begin with....
</EM><BR>
<P>But  it was Zero Powers who pointed out that a father should have some
<BR>
input regarding the fate of his unborn child.  I paid attention to what
<BR>
he said and changed my thinking accordingly.  I could see that he was
<BR>
right for several reasons, including the fact that a father is required
<BR>
under present law to help support his children, and the fact that a
<BR>
father may have other good reasons for being interested in his children
<BR>
(he may, for example, want to procreate; he may not want to be
<BR>
responsible for bringing a child into what he sees as an unpleasant
<BR>
world; he may have reason to believe that the child will be genetically
<BR>
inferior; etc.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I think you're barking up the wrong tree, purely because things 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;your way&quot; unless even more laws are put in place, and we aren't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; notoriously 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the list that is in favor of government regulating women's OR men's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproductive organs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Putting aside the issue of government control of anything, humans are
<BR>
social creatures and tend to live together in groups.  Even if pure
<BR>
anarchy prevailed in the world,  the various groups of people living
<BR>
together voluntarily would each want to come up with a basic code of
<BR>
behavior for interacting among themselves.  Even to say that each
<BR>
individual woman decides what to do with the products of her body is to
<BR>
make a decision.  And the woman's complete control over her child must
<BR>
end at some point--that point being when the child becomes accepted as a
<BR>
full member of the group or community.  And then you're back to the point
<BR>
of having to decide when a child becomes a member--whether at birth or at
<BR>
some later or earlier time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I see that you are looking at the future and trying to solve a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good luck.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you for wishing me well; but I must disagree with you about the
<BR>
time frame.  Legal abortions appear to be in danger in the US at this
<BR>
very moment.
