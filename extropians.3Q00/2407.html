<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Here's a thought: &quot;Why is it that in Chicago handgun crime is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  fairly common despite the fact that they banned handguns over 18
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  years ago, yet the surrounding suburbs where handguns are legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have almost no handgun crime?&quot;  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Brian,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Thank you.  As a guy living in one of those suburbs I will use that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ammunition.  Did you ever notice the guys that go on a shooting rampage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killing innocents?  I am sure you have; but did you ever notice how few of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them ever receive return fire even by policemen?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I keep hearing that some of these shooting rampages have been ended by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizens defending themselves but that these incidents do not make the media.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Do you have any facts on this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's some facts: a large percent of illegally purchased guns used in gun
<BR>
crimes in CHicago were sold to criminals BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. As Brian can
<BR>
probably give more details on this, there has been an ongoing scandal involving
<BR>
members of the Chicago police department and members of the ATF selling large
<BR>
quantities of guns to criminals, ostensibly as part of 'undercover operations'
<BR>
which never wound up with any arrests. A similar situation is being uncovered
<BR>
right now in Boston in the Cape Verdean community, which has seen an increase in
<BR>
gun violence due apparently to the illegal gun running activities of one Cape
<BR>
Verdean gentleman, Augusto Lopez, who, it turns out, bought his guns from
<BR>
'undercover policemen'.  This just resulted on Sunday in the first youth killed
<BR>
by gunfire in Boston since 1998, a Cape Verdean 16 year old boy shot during a
<BR>
drive by in Dorchester. This Lopez character was just arrested last week, and
<BR>
we'll have to see what turn up in the story if any of his guns purchased from
<BR>
cops are in fact murder weapons. While normally, such an offense would result at
<BR>
least in gun trafficing charges against the sellers, but I doubt any policmen,
<BR>
in Boston or CHicago, will ever be convicted of such.
