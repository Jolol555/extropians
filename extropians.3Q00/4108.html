<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ah...no, the original proposal was that there be a human operator on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the other end - and presumably one more skilled in the activity being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done than the humbot (else, the humbot itself could just do the task
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without the expense of an operator) - thus leaving no nuances for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humbot to contribute.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
There's a lot of room between the two positions.  A professional lab 
<BR>
assistant may be more competent than the research director at running 
<BR>
certain equipment, but probably not in understanding the theory being 
<BR>
tested.  One possible interface would involve the humbot seeing a heads-up 
<BR>
picture of the actions he is to perform.  This would be handy when very 
<BR>
precise direction is necessary, but probably very tiring to both parties.  I 
<BR>
would think that a simpler sensory connection - one that sent a buzzing 
<BR>
sensation to transducers, telling the humbot to swivel his or her head, 
<BR>
simultaneously (with a second or so lag) with the controller turning his or 
<BR>
her head for example, would provide a very realistic feeling of &quot;being 
<BR>
there.&quot;  Some practice in this modality might lead to some very good 
<BR>
teamwork, I suspect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Taking a different spin on this...what about seating-limited events?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Say, a legal proceeding or a government meeting where The Powers That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Be wish to limit public input.)  One person sits in, webcasting what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going on; a bunch of interested parties monitor the feed and have a chat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;session discussing what's going on.  Perhaps the person could even get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feedback as to what to do (say, if one of the viewers thinks of a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;retort to the Powers' &quot;respond to this complex question within five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seconds or we'll assume our point is made&quot;); either all the parties
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could have voice input, or there could be a moderator who is the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one who can directly give feedback to the attendee, and gives it based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the chat session.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly, altho there I suspect you would want your smartest person on site, 
<BR>
so they would also likely be the controller and decide what gets done.
<BR>
<P>As our bandwidth over the RF PDA/cellphone improves, I suspect that a lot of 
<BR>
telepresence and tele-experience will become very popular.  Instead of 
<BR>
calling 911 from under an avelanche, a hundred thousand thrill seekers will 
<BR>
be there with you - placing bets on your survival.
