<EM>&gt; oh, sorry. Though my memories stretch back to the crib, I don't know how
</EM><BR>
old I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; was then, though obviously it was in the first year or so. Comprehending
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; early self, IMHO, is impacted more by the fact that most people have no
</EM><BR>
memories
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of that age. Its hard to comprehend something you have no memories of to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; associate with, so the 3-month old is not a good analogy for the question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It is actually my full point that you can't grok your 3-month old self. Why
<BR>
don't we have any memories of that age? At that age, kids do remember
<BR>
things; they have more continuity of self than, say, a goldfish (in my
<BR>
opinion as the dad of a 4 month old, anyway). They even have long term
<BR>
memory; they know who their primary carers are, for instance.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if we can't remember what it was like to be that age, because the
<BR>
points of view of an adult and a 3-month old are so disparate; maybe there
<BR>
is just no way to model what it is like to be 3 months old, so you lose the
<BR>
information, save for the odd, mostly untrustworthy, flash or vision.
<BR>
<P>I'm thinking that an SI, even one which is technically an augmented human
<BR>
(ie: take raw human adult, add technology, iterate), may have the same
<BR>
trouble with grokking grown up humans, that we have with our littlest folk;
<BR>
surely, after all, the gap in mental power is similar.
<BR>
<P>It's pretty much impossible to understand/experience being smarter than you
<BR>
are, to any large degree. Maybe it is likewise as difficult to be
<BR>
understand/experience being dumber (outside of a small range)?

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sure, but the path there is contiguous (and paved with good
</EM><BR>
intentions
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every step of the way). Am I now something my 3-month old former
</EM><BR>
self
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't possibly comprehend? Hell, yeah. But it's still me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly enough, you likely can't comprehend your 3-month old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; former
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self any better than it could you now.
