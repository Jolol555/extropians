<P>But, does it imply perfection at some exact moment or in process?  If we
<BR>
don't assume that the end of this universe (if those models are as
<BR>
correct as we think) is the absolute end of any and all sentiences that
<BR>
came into being in this universe, then it is not so certain that we
<BR>
cannot be immortal for instance.  That we can be killed now and perhaps
<BR>
for several thousand more years does not imply we will inevitably die.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;omnis&quot;.  Suppose those Omega point folks are right for a moment. 
<BR>
That Sentience will be as omniscient as it is possible to be.  Beyond
<BR>
that isan impossibility.  Is an omni defined by definition to be
<BR>
impossible of acheiving a fair standard of anything at all?  If it is
<BR>
utterly impossible than apply the idea to &quot;God&quot; or &quot;gods&quot; makes all such
<BR>
trivially impossible.  But that is a rather pointless game.  To a human,
<BR>
especially a primitive one, the smallest of the Powers would satisfy the
<BR>
omni criteria.  Omni-present?  Well, if this eventual Sentience ever
<BR>
manages to transcend space-time then conceivably (depending on how you
<BR>
take things like Many Worlds notions) this being can in fact be
<BR>
omni-present, Alpha and Omega, and so on.  
<BR>
<P>As a matter of fact, a Singularity class sentience or several of them
<BR>
combining is about the only way I can imagine that something like most
<BR>
think of as &quot;God&quot; could exist.
