<P>
<EM>&gt;Ralph, didnt students fight when you were in high school?
</EM><BR>
<P>NO -- NEVER, I can't remember a fight ever happening in grade or high school.
<BR>
And this was when the movie &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;s was made (so everyone can
<BR>
guess my age now). Some &quot;hoods&quot; did
<BR>
carry switchblades but it was more of a fashion statement. Most of the &quot;hoods&quot; 
<BR>
were really nice guys if you actually got to know them as I did in shop class.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Wow, have things changed so much in 20 years?  Did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the young criminal element more or less constantly present
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unstated threats (and often very clearly stated threats) against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the law-abiding majority?  You must have grown up in a nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neighborhood, Ralph.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just a normal middle class neighborhood in southern Jersey. Once in junior
<BR>
or high school one guy (a football player) did push me in the hallway (with
<BR>
the side of his arm ,not his hand or fist) and I just stood there and gave
<BR>
him a pissed off look that that stoped him in his tracks. I guess it was an
<BR>
early jock vs nerd sort of thing. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; God has all civil behavior died in our society?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I dont know.  When did all this civil behavior come to life?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I never saw much that resembled civil behavior until I went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to college.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Perhaps when we let it die and we stoped telling pepple &quot;that's not cool&quot;
<BR>
or when we passed so many laws that everyone thought let the law and the
<BR>
police take care of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To make it clear, I am not defending uncivil behavior or arguing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it should be tolerated, just that it has been in the past, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that things appear to be changing, so long as the victim is gay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In 5th grade, I was once paddled for being mugged.  In high school
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our class valedictorian was expelled for two weeks for being the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;victim of a totally unprovoked attack (both long stories).  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
You were paddled for BEING mugged!!!!! And I thought I was cynical about
<BR>
authority.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Best Wishes
