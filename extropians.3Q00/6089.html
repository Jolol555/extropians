<EM>&gt; &gt; So, to take a classic case, what happens when your security/law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enforcement body decides to haul me away on some charge that makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to your law making agency but my law making agency and security/law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enforcement utterly disagrees?  Who decides the issue?  Do they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fight it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; out?  What next level body and set of rules do they appeal to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Something similar to this situation has developed in the area of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; international law as applied to e-commerce.  For example, when a dispute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arises between a  merchant physically located in Callifornia over goods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufactured in and shipped from Korea to a buyer in England, it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clear which country's laws will apply for purposes of interpreting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contract, or which courts have jurisdiction in the event one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties wishes to file a lawsuit.  Ideally, the parties would specify
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this in their initial contract, but this is often neglected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The situation is similar to that which existed when merchant ships first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; began traveling between Europe and China.  While ships were at sea they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were bound to the laws of no jurisdiction.  Admiralty law developed in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; response to the need for predictability in the relationships between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ships at sea.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is also the Uniform Commercial Code (a less well known but more important,
<BR>
IMHO, uncle/cousin to GATT)
