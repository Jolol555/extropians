<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Corporations are a matter of people getting together cooperatively to

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; organize their efforts.  How can it be evil for a group of people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; voluntarily organize, and to offer jobs to others?  Every aspect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the process, from the formation of the corporation, to the job offer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the acceptance, is voluntary and agreed to by all concerned.

<EM>&gt;There must be opportunities in the world for making profits while doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evil. The corporation as a form of relatively efficient organization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;allows more of these opportunities to be accessed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A lot of evil contributed to big corporations seem to consist of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situations where two parties voluntarily cooporate on some effort, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because one of the parties is in a significantly weaker bargaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position (because of market conditions, lack of information, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatever), most of the benefit deriving from the effort goes to the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;party (i.e. shareholders of the corporation). Is it evil to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The only difference in the two instances could be that in the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case the business might be a simple partnership, and in the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case it was a corporation, having duly filed &quot;articles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; incorporation&quot; with the secretary of state of the state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Massachusetts.  And therefore in one case I can recover damages from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the business owners and in the other case I might not.  This strikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; me as something which materially affects me to which I never agreed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That is true, but what is your proposed alternative? Do you seriously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suggest eliminating liability limitation for corporations? What about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the liability limitation represented by personal bankruptcies?
</EM><BR>
<P>One way to deal with limited liability - other than by state fiat, which I 
<BR>
would claim is the real problem - is thru prior contract.  Insurance could 
<BR>
also be a reasonably good buffer, but when you see $billion+ awards being 
<BR>
handed out by juries who are probably not anywhere nearly qualified to make 
<BR>
judgements in such cases, you realize that the legal system, and the 
<BR>
uncertainties it introduces due to the open-ended or ill-informed judgements 
<BR>
that it can produce, is a key element of the problem.
<BR>
<P>THE SOLUTION, then, would be to have a universal contract, specifying 
<BR>
methods by which disputes would be resolved.  Subcontracts, such as one 
<BR>
involving limited liability, would then not be a problem, as they are now 
<BR>
because of the difficulty of contracting with each customer separately.  So 
<BR>
long as a company was dealing with customers who had agreed to a generic 
<BR>
subcontract that specified, for example, that any company with &quot;.ltd&quot; in its 
<BR>
name had assumed some kind of limitation in its liability, which they could 
<BR>
investigate further if they chose, then they would have effectively limited 
<BR>
their liability just as with a state fiat corporation.  Operations that 
<BR>
certified safety - Underwriters Laboratory, for example (UL) - could add 
<BR>
additional layers of security for all parties.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line: it is an invitation to corruption - and an inherent assault on 
<BR>
the public and their rights to compensation for losses caused by 
<BR>
irresponsible or criminal actions - to allow the state to create limitations 
<BR>
on liability by fiat, as is now the case.  Market mechanisms to accomplish 
<BR>
the same ends would be limited and guided by the criteria of actual 
<BR>
profitability - for all parties.
