<EM>&gt; The (pathetic) state of the art is stuff being done by John Koza. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can read him up on the web, and in several (by now three) fat MIT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Press bibles, all titled Genetic Programming (I, II and now III if not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IV, I believe), where he struts his (some of them actually pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nifty) achievements.
</EM><BR>
<P>Koza has a list called, of all things, genetic-programming.  I used to be on
<BR>
it, but the traffic was too high -- like this list doesn't have any noise!:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The field has huge potential, but is right now stuck imo slightly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before cyanobacteria stage, for several reasons. Most of them is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mature (those having lived through a few iterations) evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithms are very subtle, not all details of natural instances of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them are known, and the few Comp. Sci. evolutionary algorithm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practitioners ignore even what little we already know, standing smack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; middle in da Nile. Sounds a lot like AI, huh?
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  From a business perspective, too, the applications are arcane.
<BR>
Yes, certain forms of genetic programming, such as genetic algorithmns (GA)
<BR>
have been used in certain areas of engineering design where things are
<BR>
highly formalizable -- you can create a system of [nonlinear] differential
<BR>
equations to model, say, propellers blades, then use GA to solve them --
<BR>
there isn't much else.  At least, there's little that someone is building a
<BR>
viable business plan around.  No one, to my knowledge, is using them for,
<BR>
say, e-commerce or web development.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another reason is that GP looks like programming straight from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Salpetriere to most Comp. Sci. people, unless they are martians. Clash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of paradigms, very much so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good way of putting it.  I do think, however, if we stick to areas where
<BR>
such things as GA work now, we could get a lot from them.  Any area where we
<BR>
have an already formalized system that is nonlinear can be a target.  I
<BR>
would stick to enigineering projects for now, such as the one mentioned
<BR>
before.  Not only are many of these already formalized, BUT they've been so
<BR>
for a while, so it wouldn't be astounding or controversial to apply GA to
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>Anyone interested in doing that here?  (I've mentioned this on the list
<BR>
before, in regards to testing the space of cryoprotectants.  But this was
<BR>
about two or three years ago.  I think only Anders Sandberg responded.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; I'm a bit afraid that the business plan would look something like:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;     1 - Get lots o money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;     2 - Spend lots o money doing heaps of cool research into genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; programming, play around with oh so excellent equipment, discover some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; excellent stuff, have a bloody fantastic time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;     3 - Run out of money with no products/market to show for it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;     4 - get a slapping (eek) from the VC(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;     5 - Reputation in ruins, become a tramp, scavenge in bins, waiting
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I dunno about 5 (participating in a .com burnout will raise your job
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market value), but 1-4 is imo exactly how the shit can be expected to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go down. &lt;/old curmugeon&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Except for numbers 3, 4, and 5, this is my battle strategy too.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
