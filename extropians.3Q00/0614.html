<BR>
<P>In the never-ending, ever-acrimonious &quot;dialog of the deaf&quot; between the
<BR>
Darwinists and the Creationists, we are perpetually exposed to their
<BR>
extreme, non-negotiable positions.  The Darwinists insist upon their
<BR>
one-gene/one-protein genome in which random mutations slowly accumulate
<BR>
and adapt living things to the changing environment.  The Creationists
<BR>
only accept a one-time, supernatural creation of &quot;kinds&quot; plus minor
<BR>
adaptations (&quot;microevolution&quot;).
<BR>
<P>J.A. Shapiro, a professor at the University of Chicago, is searching for
<BR>
a &quot;third way,&quot; a &quot;scientific&quot;, non-Darwinian way.  Shapiro maintains that
<BR>
five decades of genetic and molecular-biology research have transformed
<BR>
our vision of life.  He compares the conceptual changes to those
<BR>
accompanying the transition from classical physics to relativity and
<BR>
quantum mechanics.  This &quot;new&quot; theory of evolution---his &quot;third&quot; way---
<BR>
will emerge from the convergence of biology and information science.
<BR>
<P>Genomes, asserts Shapiro, are not really the static &quot;beads on a string&quot;
<BR>
envisioned by the Darwinians.  Rather, they are fluid and complex.
<BR>
Genes are now seen as multipurpose elements that turn on and off as
<BR>
required for the survival and well-being of the organism they belong to.
<BR>
<P>In this paradigm-eroding paper (referenced below), Shapiro describes
<BR>
four categories of molecular discoveries that have revised our thinking
<BR>
about how evolution works: (1) Genome Organization; (2) Cellular-Repair
<BR>
Capabilities; (3) Mobile Genetic Elements and Natural Genetic Engineering;
<BR>
and (4) Cellular Information Processing.  He then writes:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of this discussion is that our current knowledge of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;genetic change is fundamentally at variance with new-Darwinist
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;postulates.  We have progressed from the Constant Genome, subject
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only to random, localized changes at a more or less constant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutation rate, to the Fluid Genome, subject to episodic, massive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and non-random reorganizations capable of producing new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functional architectures.  Inevitably, such a profound advance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in awareness of genetic capabilities will dramatically alter
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our understanding of the evolutionary process.
<BR>
<P>Toward the end, Shapiro approaches, as he logically must, the really
<BR>
crucial point in the Darwinism-Creationism debate.  Is there guiding
<BR>
intelligence at work in the evolution of life?  He cannot answer this
<BR>
question at this time, and neither can science in general.  He puts
<BR>
his hope for a definitive answer on the fact that we are now &quot;on the
<BR>
threshold of a new way of thinking about living organisms and their
<BR>
variations.&quot;  It is time, he says, for the Darwinists to abandon
<BR>
their &quot;posture of outraged orthodoxy,&quot; to become real scientists,
<BR>
and to use the new insights we have gained about the workings of the
<BR>
genome and try to answer this most-fundamental of all the questions
<BR>
that face science.
