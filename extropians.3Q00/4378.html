<P><EM> &gt; I don't think this is an accurate characterization.  The rules don't
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; change at all; there is still fierce competition among intelligent,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; self-directed entities.  All that happens is that the competition moves

<EM> &gt; out of the grossly physical domain for the most part.

<BR>
We're still pretty far from an equilibrium, still being in a
<BR>
spontaneous expansion process of civilisation into the wilderness. The
<BR>
grossly physical part may well come back with a vengeance (see the
<BR>
emergence of neoplagues and pests for a shade of things potentially to
<BR>
come), when we're nearing the more sustainable/equilibrium part of the
<BR>
development. Assuming the constraints of finite concentration of
<BR>
matterenergy in spacetime must always hold, things must eventually
<BR>
plateau. Before things might pass through a sequence of bottlenecks,
<BR>
e.g. if we can't expand freely into space, after having covered the
<BR>
planet with a thick crust of manmade artefacts and people.

<BR>
<EM> &gt; The capability to project outcomes of actions as a result of increased
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligence and knowledge is most likely responsible for this shift. 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The ability to accurately forecast the costs/benefits for a broad range of

<P>Of course, by expressing the planned behaviour, we're collectively
<BR>
changing the state of the system, and hence introduce an additional
<BR>
uncertainty. The others constitute a major part of the fitness
<BR>
function, which has to move when their strategies move. For instance,
<BR>
all the fat dotcom fishes in a tiny pond create a lot of ruckus, and
<BR>
muddy the waters. Mutually making planning more difficult. Time for
<BR>
some dynamite fishing ;)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; potential actions would encourage more subtle and less costly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; manipulations than brute force to achieve the same effective results in a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; competitive environment.  It also allows one to recognize losing

<BR>
stage. Dumb agents still pretty much brute-force.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; costly than attrition and not as grossly destructive, but it requires
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; superior situational intelligence to accomplish.
