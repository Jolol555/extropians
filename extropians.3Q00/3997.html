<EM>&gt; Overall, I believe markets *are* better than centralized planning. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt that at our current level of technological and economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development we're going to come up with something that's better accross
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the board. However, I think everything can be debugged, and that's what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm trying to do with the concept of free markets. I'm not good at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticing bugs in this case, because I'm so immersed in free market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think. I'm hoping to get some input from others on...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) Flaws in how other market systems were implemented.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) Problems that are inherently intractable to market solutions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Economists have widely studied failures of markets.  There are probably
<BR>
hundreds or thousands of books available specifically on the subject.
<BR>
<P>In my intro economics class we were taught about two classes of market
<BR>
failures, externalities and public goods.
<BR>
<P>Externalities are factors which would affect the optimal level of
<BR>
production but which aren't taken into consideration by the market.
<BR>
The classic example is beekeeping.  Beekeepers set their level of
<BR>
production based on their costs, and the price of honey.  The overall
<BR>
level of honey produced is optimal under standard market analysis, if
<BR>
you consider only honey consumers and producers.
<BR>
<P>However there are third parties who benefit from the bees.  The bees
<BR>
pollinate plants and crops in the areas.  The net social welfare would
<BR>
be increased if there were more bees, above the level which the honey
<BR>
market would set.  This is an example of a positive externality.
<BR>
<P>Negative externalities would be things like pollution, side effects
<BR>
of production which harm other people but which don't show up in the
<BR>
market price.
<BR>
<P>Public goods are good which cannot be practically excluded.  If provided
<BR>
to one, they are provided to all (in some community).  Classic examples
<BR>
would be things like clean air, or national defense.  Market systems
<BR>
can be shown to underprovide public goods, compared to the optimal level.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.thisnation.com/whygovt-economic-market.html">http://www.thisnation.com/whygovt-economic-market.html</A> is an article
<BR>
describing these two plus four other forms of market failure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; c) Is it a binary axis of markets versus central planning, or are there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    conflict resolution and resource allocation systems that are completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    different from both approaches.
</EM><BR>
<P>Economists do study other systems.  Auctions are distinct from markets
<BR>
and are used for scarce resource allocations.  There are various idealized
<BR>
systems in which people cooperatively agree on production/consumption
<BR>
levels, such as the various generalizations on &quot;I cut, you choose&quot;
<BR>
which get reported in the news occasionally.
<BR>
<P>I have a paper around somewhere which shows an &quot;ideal government&quot;.
<BR>
It is a set of rules for allocating spending on public goods, and setting
<BR>
taxation levels, which provably makes everyone happier (or at least no
<BR>
less happy) with their lot than under a pure market system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; d) Are there any books or essays that anybody would recommend for a rational,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    constructive critique of market systems?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you have access to a university library you could look for books on the
<BR>
topic of market failure.  As I said it is a very widely studied effect.
<BR>
Or you can do a web search on the same phrase.
<BR>
<P>The thing to keep in mind is that centralized systems also have failures,
<BR>
and those failure modes tend to be worse IMO.
<BR>
