<EM>&gt; &gt; While I understand the sentiment, I've often thought that citizenship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be automajically conferred with birth, but earned through merit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Pournelle's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; concept of the planet Sparta being such an example), and you could argue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heritable citizenship is technically inconsistent with the Constitution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prohibition on inherited titles, your statement forgets the logic that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; once you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are in, you are in for life, and anyone that is out, is out. Of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; members get by 'on scholarship'.... ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nice to quibble over such things, but how should citizenship be conferred?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And should noncitizens be subject to the government, if one believes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government with the consent of the governed?  (If one does not, that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another story.)
</EM><BR>
<P>While one could say that the nation having an open immigration policy with
<BR>
regard to outgoing traffic, anyone who doesn't leave is consenting to be
<BR>
governed by those in charge, i.e. the old 'voting with their feet' gambit. This
<BR>
policy seems to work within the 50 states, as the various state governments tend
<BR>
to get distressed if there is a high rate of taxpayers leaving their particular
<BR>
state for greener pastures (unless, of course, those leaving tend to be of the
<BR>
welfare class). Thus a non-citizen who stays here, when they could leave any
<BR>
time, is in actuality consenting to be taxed.
<BR>
<P>Taxing a non-citizen 'legally' could take many forms, for example, imposing
<BR>
expatriation tariffs on money sent by non-citizens out of the country to
<BR>
relatives elsewhere would not be a direct tax on their income, but on their
<BR>
'gift' to others.
<BR>
<P>Additionally, the INS does tend to encourage resident aliens who are productive
<BR>
taxpayers to become citizens. Sasha, for example, had told me he was debating
<BR>
becoming a citizen for a few years, but was unsure the potential tax advantages
<BR>
of remaining in his current position (since he had been exiled from the USSR,
<BR>
which no longer existed, he was actually not a citizen of any country, which I'm
<BR>
sure drove the INS to distraction, as they would have no place to deport him to
<BR>
if he ever became a liability, and bureaucrats hate quantum people.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Kinda like being appointed to the Supreme Court, once you are there,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; much they can do to you. Notice how Clarence Thomas doesn't give a rats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patooty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what NAACP, et al think of him (not that he cared much before), but there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nothing they can do to him once he passed the 'high tech lynching' the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; forth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But Thomas does care.  Note how before he was appointed, he was very much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for Natural Law, but during the appointment process he turned into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pragmatist very quickly.  I guess his avowed principles were only so much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; window dressing.  (Or, if he's returned to them, they are only to be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they are convenient.)  This tells me he is not independent minded.  He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just caters to a different audience than the NAACP.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know where you get any of this. What is your rationale for this claim?
