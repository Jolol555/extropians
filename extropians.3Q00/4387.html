<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;         Why do you not consider the &quot;SI&quot; as part of civilization?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Things will happen at ever increasing rate as we approach the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; singularity, but this will occur for all of civilization right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Why/how would it occur to just one seed program all alone?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because the SI will be developing at its own accelerated exponential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rates, while most of civilization will still be advancing at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strictly biological, or at best augmented biological rates.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, is some God going to come down and say to us
<BR>
&quot;biologicals&quot; 'though shalt not ever super augment our ability to
<BR>
biologically improve, and eventually cross over, upload, or to do
<BR>
whatever is required to keep up'?  I certainly plan altering myself in
<BR>
any way necessary to keep up.  Don't you?
