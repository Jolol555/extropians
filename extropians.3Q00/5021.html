</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Why? Arcologies are in actuality highly wasteful structures,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;demanding more resources per occupant than a more diffuse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;community.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Huh? Got a URL to support this? Apartment buildings use much less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; resources than individual houses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I guess the reasoning is that operationally they may be more efficient, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; building them demands so much more design and labor work, as well as more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expensive higher performance materials that the resources used to support that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; overwhelm those saved in the day to day operations. So long as building
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; efficiencies discount savings beyond 10 years as much as they do, arcologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will always be negative impactors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You don't build an acrcology for a 10 year lifespan, however.  Consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average apartment building - the lifespan is 20-40 years, on average, unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is a dramatic defect.  An arcology would be an organic structure, in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would constantly be undergoing small and large changes over time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats right. However, the capital markets don't give a damn. This is the same
<BR>
reason that alternative energy has never really taken off, because it is so
<BR>
front end loaded with capital expenses, you have to be a government, using slave
<BR>
labor, to be able to afford building one. Soleri's Arcosanti does this halfway,
<BR>
with plenty of highly educated slave labor building it, and operating their
<BR>
whole fundraising/propagandizing/merchandizing operation to finance gradual
<BR>
construction. Until conventional building/community planning schemes are forced
<BR>
to be more expensive by some mechanism, arcologies will always be non-starters
<BR>
to anyone but a near religious fanatic.
