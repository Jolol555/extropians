&lt;&lt;Spudboy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that Hitler was a socialist how is it he was also a capitalist.  
<BR>
Could you define that term capitalist?  I am confused.

<BR>
<P>Ron! Please do not be decieved by the name National Socialist. My guess is that the Party name Nationalist Party, founded immediately after WW1 and also a Racist-Nordic myth party, funded by the autocrats and the industrial chieftans--their leader, if I remember correctly was Hugenburg. The National Socialists had nothing to do with socialism (despite the many flaws of socialism) it was just a way of packaging their hatreds while avoiding the &quot;copyright infringements&quot; of the larger competing racist, National Party. Hitler loaded his pockets down and was a capitalist in the sense that he wanted to make a profit. He was absolutely not a free-enterprise capitalist. The shopkeepers that supported him were also capitalists too. Hope this helps.
