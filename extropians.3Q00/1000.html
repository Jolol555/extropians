<P><EM>&gt; Another possibility that hasn't been discussed is that nanotech might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be entirely automated!  It could be that for anything more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complicated than raw diamond, you'll need a group of nanoengineers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; painstakingly assembling the object and watching for errors, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; automation of the process coming later in the game.
</EM><BR>
<P>Eliezer I think is correct in that you are going to need a slew
<BR>
of nanoengineers.  If we have diamondoid nanoassembly by 2010
<BR>
as Von Err has predicted, then those engineers are entering high
<BR>
school around now.  I doubt very much that there are thousands
<BR>
of young people see themselves on career paths to nanoengineering.
<BR>
The few nanoengineers that are produced by a few select schools
<BR>
are likely to find themselves in the high-demand positions of the
<BR>
software engineers today.
<BR>
<P>Not to say the software engineers won't have it pretty good as
<BR>
well (you gotta program those assemblers, verify the designs and
<BR>
automate as much of the process as possible to work around the
<BR>
fact that you didn't train enough people during this decade).
<BR>
<P>So its likely we will have the technology and run *smack* into
<BR>
the wall of consequences of people never believing we would.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All things considered, nanomaterials will probably start out at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thousands or millions of dollars per gram, too expensive for anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but nanocomputers, with prices dropping by a factor of ten every year or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, even gold and biotech enzymes aren't *millions* of dollars a gram.
<BR>
There are nanoscale materials being fabricated in bulk quantities today
<BR>
and they aren't that expensive.  To get the suggested prices, you would
<BR>
have to be manufacturing something that really cannot be done using
<BR>
larger scale technology.  Nanocomputers don't do it because I can get
<BR>
the same computational capacity using a large bunch of non-nanoscale
<BR>
computers.  So nanotech solutions will not be able to be much more expensive
<BR>
than the non-nano equivalents.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is still much more gradual than &quot;Surprise!  Everything is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollar a kilo!&quot;  It looks like nanomanufacturing will hit the economy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gradually, rather than sharply, relatively speaking.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  The lack of designs are going to be limiting for quite some time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The problem is that even automated manufacturing of raw diamond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gives you military superiority in fighter jets, and isotopic separation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and mass-produced nukes comes not too long after that.
</EM><BR>
<P>You keep raising the fighter jet point.  I'll simply make two in response -
<BR>
a) How frequently do we use our fighter jets today (which are clearly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superior to anything anyone else produces [*if* they even have them!])?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In other words &quot;so what&quot; if we have diamondoid fighter jets?)
<BR>
b) Diamondoid fighter jets are easily countered by diamondoid surface-to-air
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missles (perhaps more so).
<BR>
<P>Your point only seems important if you are suggesting that some nasty
<BR>
power (North Korea? Iraq?) gets diamondoid assembly and can produce
<BR>
full scale macro-nano-designs in a time scale much shorter than it
<BR>
would take us to develop complementary countermeasures?  Is that
<BR>
what you are suggesting might happen?  Or are you afraid that the U.S.
<BR>
will develop diamondoid nanoassembly and use it in U.S. fighter jets
<BR>
to spread the U.S. version of democracy all over the world?
<BR>
<P>Now, with isotopic separation *where* do you get the raw uranium
<BR>
(or plutonium)?  Can this be hidden from current nonproliferation
<BR>
checks or satellite observations?  Even if you have mass-produced
<BR>
nuclear weapons -- would you use them?  Bioweapons development wasn't
<BR>
enough to induce the use of nuclear weapons, why should nanoweapons
<BR>
development be any different?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If nanotech comes first, the two key questions are military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destabilization and the effect of nanocomputers on AI.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have made the key statement -- &quot;destabilization&quot;.  Currently
<BR>
the country in the forefront of nanotech and biotech is the U.S.
<BR>
Other countries are probably 2-10 years behind us.  Can you make
<BR>
a case that this situation is likely to change?
<BR>
<P>Then there is the problem of having a *designs* for nanoscale
<BR>
nanocomputers.  Nanosystems is 8 years old this year and there
<BR>
still isn't an atomic scale design for a nanocomputer, though I
<BR>
believe the software with which an atomic scale design could
<BR>
be done does exist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If nanocomputers are classified as military material, so AI researchers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and specifically the Singularity Institute) can't get them, then the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation looks a lot worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would be very surprised if Mitre doesn't produce a molecular computer
<BR>
and win the Feynman Prize within the next 3-4 years.  I'd be even more
<BR>
surprised if HP/IBM/Lucent do not demonstrate prototype molecular computers
<BR>
within the next 3-8 years.  And that is without classical diamondoid
<BR>
nanoassembly.  I don't see the probability of being very high that these
<BR>
will become classified.  There may be fairly large lag between lab demonstrations
<BR>
of these capabilities and end-user machines using them simply because we
<BR>
don't currently have code (other than perpaps physical simulations) that
<BR>
requires that kind of speed.
