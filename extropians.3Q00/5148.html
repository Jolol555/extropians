<EM>&gt; Just out of curiousity, show of hands: How many here have worked or are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working for startups?  I've worked for two so far.
</EM><BR>
<P>Four here: one failed (they're still in business - I think - but not
<BR>
for much longer), two promising (one with stock options, one with just
<BR>
plain stock, both of which may be going IPO within a year), and one
<BR>
successful (got sustainable, but decided not to go IPO; the result is a
<BR>
bit convulted, but a win for me in the end).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That said, would any here be willing to work at a start with others on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list?  This is based on what you already know -- assuming no one on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is representing a hand they're not holding.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends on other factors (for instance, skill sets).  As you may be able
<BR>
to tell, I am trying to come up with a way to turn some of the things we
<BR>
discuss into reality, and have latched onto business (which necessarily
<BR>
implies at least going through a startup phase) as the most likely path.
<BR>
A hundred engineers plus one sales person does not a company make; and
<BR>
(for example) a hundred computer engineers plus zero people with
<BR>
extensive knowledge of biology and/or of people who use said knowledge
<BR>
daily does not a biotech company make (see the failure above).
