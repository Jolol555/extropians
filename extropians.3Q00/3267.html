<P>
My name is perfectly ordinary, though it took some work to get it
<BR>
there. That makes it partly a birth name and partly chosen; I adopted
<BR>
the distinctive (and exotic to an American pre-teen) Icelandic ethnic
<BR>
form of my first name, and found myself compelled by aesthetics to
<BR>
restore the &quot;s&quot; in my surname that had been dropped in
<BR>
Americanization in my grandfather's generation.  Surnames turn over
<BR>
each generation in Iceland, where your surname is your father's first
<BR>
name followed by sson or dottir.  Historic siblings Leivur (Leif)
<BR>
Eriksson and Freydis Eriksdottir are a good example of how it works. 
<BR>
My name &quot;should&quot; be Eirikur Jonasson by the old ways.  My
<BR>
greatgrandfather changed his surname to agree with his first name to
<BR>
make Americanization easier!  Hallgrimur Jonasson became Hallgrimur
<BR>
Hallgrimsson.  Easier, yeah, right.  So it seemed to me, even at a
<BR>
fairly early age, that I had right of choice.  My father was very
<BR>
much against it though.
<BR>
<P>Linguistically, the Old Norse Eirikur becomes Erik and then Eric as
<BR>
the inflected endings were eventually dropped except in Iceland
<BR>
itself.  The &quot;ur&quot; is actually the same inflection (a tag meaning
<BR>
masculine singular noun) as the &quot;us&quot; in classical Latin names like
<BR>
Julius, Marcus, etc.  It's interesting how Indoeuropean languages
<BR>
have actually lost a lot of formal structure.  It makes me wonder how
<BR>
that complexity came to be in the first place, if we came to do
<BR>
pretty well without it.
