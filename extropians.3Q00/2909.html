<EM>&gt; Does anyone else here think is unfair and unjust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a woman can always get out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsibility for a child (before birth by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aborting it and after birth by putting it up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; adoption), while a man can literally be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsible for hundreds of thousands in expenses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just because he was careless enough not to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rubber, or because a woman's birth control method
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; did not work or because he was lied to? (&quot;Yes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honey, I'm on the pill.&quot;) Fair is fair. If women
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legally don't have to support their kids, men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shouldn't have to either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm gay, but if I were a heterosexual man the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prospect of having sex with any woman would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greatly concern me for these reasons.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, with cloning, you being gay doesn't exempt you from these concerns
<BR>
at all (moreover, in the case I previously cited, a man passed out at a
<BR>
party at a womans house from being drunk, woke up with no clothes on,
<BR>
and the woman admitted to people she had sex with him while passed out,
<BR>
yet he was still held liable for support. So it really doesn't matter if
<BR>
you are straight or gay.) If a woman decides you are just the sort of
<BR>
person she wants to raise as a child, and she snags some of your hair
<BR>
from your hairbrush or off the toilet (now we know why gays are so
<BR>
fastidious! ;) ) and has you cloned and is impregnated with that embryo,
<BR>
without your knowledge, do we apply the standard of the guy who was
<BR>
passed out, or the standard of the woman who was raped to your
<BR>
situation???

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
