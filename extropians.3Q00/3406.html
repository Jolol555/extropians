<EM>&gt;&quot;Jamiro2002&quot;, please reveal your true name so that I may file a lawsuit for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slander against you. Such lies pass *my* limit for tolerance.
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt;Max More

<P>I so sympathize.  Back in the '70's, I put on an income tax demonstration at 
<BR>
3rd and Long Beach Blvd., on April 15th, in front of the post office and the 
<BR>
bank next door.  A week later, the Long Beach PD had me arrested for 
<BR>
&quot;Loitering With Children,&quot; 653G CA Penal Code.  This is one of those 
<BR>
open-ended codes originally designed to go after drug dealers at 
<BR>
high-schools.  As with other loitering laws, it has been repeatedly amended 
<BR>
by court decision, and they utterly failed to meet the requirements of the 
<BR>
law.  Their &quot;evidence&quot; was that I had been seen in Ocean Park taking 
<BR>
pictures when children were present.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, they pursued my conviction for about a year, costing me about 
<BR>
$50,000 all told, I estimate and thouroughly trashing my reputation in local 
<BR>
libertarian circles, where the rumor was spread that I was a child-molestor, 
<BR>
although no children were ever named as victims and no allegations of any 
<BR>
such acts were ever made by the police.  I had been giving workshops on 
<BR>
children's rights at the Future of Freedom conferences, of which I was a 
<BR>
major organizer.  The FoFCon con committee barred me from further 
<BR>
participation.
<BR>
<P>After a year, the court dismissed all charges and the court record, signed 
<BR>
by the judge, reads &quot;defendant exonerated.&quot;  I.e., the court went beyond 
<BR>
just saying that no conviction was possible to a positive statement that I 
<BR>
was in fact innocent.  Nonetheless, I STILL - over 20 YEARS later - 
<BR>
occasionally run into someone in the libertarian movement who has heard that 
<BR>
I am a child-molestor.
<BR>
<P>In at least one case a real child molestor - Tim Kuklinsky - who I 
<BR>
identified as using the local libertarian movement as his feeding ground, 
<BR>
and who, at last notice, was serving an indefinite sentence in the mental 
<BR>
division of one of the state's penal facilities, used attacks on me in this 
<BR>
light to cover his own predation.
<BR>
<P>This is not fun.  I would hope that extropians would be a little less likely 
<BR>
to jump to any suspicions based on anonymous allegations.
<BR>
<P>I'm assuming that this person did not try to contact you directly first to 
<BR>
ask you about these alleged allegations.
