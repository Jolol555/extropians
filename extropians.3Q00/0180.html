<EM>&gt;The problem here, which I haven't seen mentioned is that most of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;latter things are expected to be taught to people by their families
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as they grow up. The fact that we have to now consider moving them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into schooling shows just how bad our &quot;home education&quot; system has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gotten in many cases.
</EM><BR>
<P>This sounds reasonable at first glance.  But I wonder how accurate 
<BR>
this is historically.  How far back are you going?  What settings are 
<BR>
you considering?
<BR>
<P>Human Nutrition is pretty scientific.  I suspect women were taught to 
<BR>
cook and men ignored the subject.  Maybe feeding of children was 
<BR>
taught to women as part of child raising, but I don't believe 
<BR>
nutritional requirements were known until the relatively recently, 
<BR>
and was not routinely taught to men as part of taking care of 
<BR>
themselves.  I think men expected their wives to figure out what food 
<BR>
to cook.  What if we change this to Life Extension?  Then it 
<BR>
definitely is a new subject not regularly taught at home.
<BR>
<P>I doubt that Personal Finance was regularly taught at home.  I think 
<BR>
most children were taught how to carry on their father's trade. 
<BR>
Farmers were taught to farm.  I don't think anyone explained how to 
<BR>
invest or save for retirement.  Most extended families took care of 
<BR>
the elders and let the children take over the business.  The concept 
<BR>
of self-financing through later years never occurred.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that Comparative Political Systems and Comparative 
<BR>
Economics were never taught.  At least, they were not fairly 
<BR>
compared.  I think traditional teaching would have been that our 
<BR>
native system is the best and those damn foreigners do things 
<BR>
strangely.  Few would have taught their children to evaluate all the 
<BR>
different systems for strengths and weaknesses.
<BR>
<P>Self-Defense might have been taught in the &quot;Wild West&quot; of America in 
<BR>
towns where many people had guns.  These would have been small 
<BR>
localities.  Most of the frontier was peopled by farmers, miners, 
<BR>
settlers, and the like.  They expected to settled some land and live 
<BR>
quietly.  They may have had to encounter danger while travelling to 
<BR>
the west, but afterwards, they wanted to settle down.
<BR>
<P>I have similar doubts about Scientific Method, Logic, Philosophy and 
<BR>
Art.  These were the studies of a Renaissance Man.  Most common 
<BR>
everyday people never studied these topics.  I believe that 
<BR>
traditional home schooling usually consisted of some basics of 
<BR>
reading, writing and arithmetic.  I don't think scientific 
<BR>
experiments, classical logic and problem solving, philosophy and art 
<BR>
were usually included.
<BR>
<P>In summary, I think you are romanticizing home schooling too much. 
<BR>
Even if these things were taught in some homes, most homes didn't 
<BR>
even teach basic literacy.  Most farmers taught farming.  Most 
<BR>
hunters taught hunting.  Historical people did not have as much time 
<BR>
as we have today.  Often, their children started working the business 
<BR>
or in factories or mines when they were 12 or 13.  The idea that they 
<BR>
had lengthy or extensive education, or that home schooling was 
<BR>
traditionally better than modern education is exaggerated.
