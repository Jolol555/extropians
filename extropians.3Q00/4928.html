<P>I'd like to write a lengthy, pungent response to this, but don't really

have time just now. Sketchily:

<P>As it stands, this is nuts. It might be true that `For every species that
<BR>
becomes extinct' one already extant spreads to fill the slot, but I doubt
<BR>
it, and anyway I'm not that enthusiastic about slashing diversity. During
<BR>
Pangea, there was a vast dieback, as local island biogeographies became
<BR>
crowded into a single world-island ecology. Vast amounts of biological
<BR>
information were lost. We have recreated this circumstance, to a large
<BR>
degree, with global shipping and air transport. Chris Lavers makes the
<BR>
argument compellingly in a new book with the crowd-titillating title WHY
<BR>
ELEPHANTS HAVE BIG EARS. The successful hyperanimals (rabbits, say) do not
<BR>
add much in the way of useful diversity except, perhaps, at some microlevel
<BR>
of nearly-neutral intragenomic drift. This sort of
<BR>
extinction-by-competition is usually aversive these days, I should think.
<BR>
And not what one associates with a term such as `extropian'.
