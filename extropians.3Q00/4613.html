<EM>&gt; &gt; Humans do have an abstract reasoning module, and

<EM>&gt; &gt; to give the impression that it is in fact in such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control over the rest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the mind.  But in fact I think our conscious

<EM>&gt; minds are more like the

<EM>&gt; &gt; PR department of our minds - they try to put a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good spin on the decisions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that are made, but are not actually in much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control over those decisions.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I suspect that most of what we perceive about our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own consciousness is wrong.  It is like a visual / 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perceptual illusion, brought inward and made 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pervasive.  The entire mind is an optical illusion.
</EM><BR>
<P>{snip}
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Dennett has a model along these lines, in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consciousness is essentially an illusion, a lie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; created by our minds. We can combine this with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Minsky's &quot;society of mind&quot; and get the following 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; picture (blue-sky speculation):
</EM><BR>
<P>{snip: wonderful description of illusory nature of
<BR>
consciousness]
<BR>
<P>This model seems likely to me as well. I think of the
<BR>
&quot;I&quot; as the part of the mind that watches the actions
<BR>
of the various societal agents and immediately spins a
<BR>
narrative (&quot;The Story of Me&quot;) to explain it all &quot;as
<BR>
if&quot; the &quot;I&quot; were a unitary causal entity. This is old
<BR>
ground but, I like the analogy of the rainbow, an
<BR>
emergent phenomenon brough about by and dependent on
<BR>
particular physical processes. &quot;I&quot; am the rainbow that
<BR>
thinks it controls the light and the rain. I have
<BR>
conceptualized transhumanism in the past as the
<BR>
rainbow's attempt to become that which it dreamed it
<BR>
was ... to move from the insubstantive to the
<BR>
substantive.
<BR>
<P>But now I wonder. 
<BR>
<P>If I seek transcendance through intelligence
<BR>
enhancement, uploading, or something else, can't I
<BR>
expect to lose this illusion I call my identity? What
<BR>
need would there be for such an illusion? Those I've
<BR>
discussed this with claim that it makes little sense
<BR>
for &quot;me&quot; to want to transhumanize if the &quot;me&quot; is lost
<BR>
in the process. There would only be a memory of the
<BR>
&quot;me&quot; illusion ... like remembering how the highway
<BR>
looks like water on a hot day.
<BR>
<P>It's odd because we cryonicists are all about
<BR>
preserving our identities/personas/personalities/etc.
<BR>
and we have long threads on the issue from time to
<BR>
time, but are we simply hoping to preserve something
<BR>
that is little more than a vestigial aspect of the the
<BR>
really important parts of our total architecture?
<BR>
<P>It's interesting to think that &quot;I&quot; am not planning on
<BR>
transcending at all. The sub-conscious agents of my
<BR>
mental architecture are making those plans while &quot;I&quot;
<BR>
take the credit.
<BR>
<P>I'm looking forward to looking backward and finally
<BR>
understanding.
<BR>
<P>So can we expect AI to have a architecture similar to
<BR>
huumans ... multiple agents acting in a coordinated
<BR>
fashion but without a central component analogous to
<BR>
our notion of a self?
