<P>
Robert,
<BR>
<P>Thanks, that was a very clear statement.  Your main point seems to be that 
<BR>
no one would send out a colonizing force without looking before they leave 
<BR>
to see whether they'll be able to successfully claim the destination star.  
<BR>
I find this reasonably plausible when the civilizations acting at each 
<BR>
possible source are monolithic entities with a cohesive point of view and a 
<BR>
single set of goals.
<BR>
<P>I don't expect that to be the way many civilizations turn out.  I don't 
<BR>
expect one mind to take over our solar system, and I don't see any a priori 
<BR>
reason to expect that it will be true of all others.  At any solar system 
<BR>
with a variety of competing interests, I'd expect some to want to leave.  
<BR>
Even if they can't tell where they'll end up or whether they'll get to 
<BR>
claim territory when they get there.  If some can gather together enough 
<BR>
resources to build a self-sustaining mission, then it won't be crucial 
<BR>
whether they'll be able to claim a star when they get to their first 
<BR>
destination.
<BR>
<P>The crux of Robin's argument is that it only takes some actors believing 
<BR>
this way to ensure that the best, fastest colonizers dominate at all the 
<BR>
frontiers.  If the entire universe is uniformly populated with seed 
<BR>
civilations, then there may not be any frontier by the time explorers leave 
<BR>
their own systems, but that one's hard to believe, too.
<BR>
<P>I know you're still looking for evidence that there are others out there, 
<BR>
but so far all we have is a lack of evidence that there will be anyone in 
<BR>
our way if we go exploring.  That gives the first to go reason enough to 
<BR>
leave, and those that follow only have to believe that they'll beat the 
<BR>
wave in front, since there will always be reason to act as if civilization 
<BR>
might collapse behind you, so you'll be the last wave to leave, if you can 
<BR>
just get out in time.
<BR>

<BR>
<EM>&gt; If the colonizers don't look then this may be right.  If they do look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and see nothing, then Robin's colony waves makes sense.  If they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot *prove* to themselves that they will not be stepping on some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giant's toes, then colonization should only occur when you have taken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your civilization to the highest possible levels because that is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only way you can defend yourself if you piss someone off.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The question isn't what have we done in the past (colonized with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little knowledge of physics and a lot of arrogance) -- it is --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Knowing what you know might be possible, can you suggest the *wisest*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colonization strategy for civilizations around our level? 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; When I look out into the galaxy, I don't expect to see the people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reproduced and colonized the most -- I expect to see the smartest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people.
