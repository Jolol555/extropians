<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Yes. Name the free market corporation that was in charge of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; persecution. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Retro: ever hear of I.G. Farben during WW2? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Farben did not run the death camps, they were merely the contractors that
<BR>
supplied them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or the Belgian Gold Minning companies in the 19th century Congo? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Who were operating under plenipotentiary police authority from the government of
<BR>
Belgium. Not a free market corporation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Or the 4000 dead in accidents like in Bhopal back in the 1980's? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Compared to what? The best you can come up with are isolated incidents where a
<BR>
few hundred or few thousand people were killed, mostly by accident and not
<BR>
intent, whereas governments kill in the tens of millions with intention. Where
<BR>
is your moral relativism now???
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the other hand these capitalists wouldn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; succeeded if not for Governments. Yet, The Adolph Hitler Fund, was supported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from 1929-1945 by Krupp, and Messerschmidt, and so forth. The year 1929,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather then the start of WW2 (1939) is accurate as far as I have been able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell. The German capitalists switched their funding from Von Pappen's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Race-Nationalist's The National Partei to Hitler's National Socialists after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1926, all secretly of course. Anyway, yes governments kill 100000 times more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then capitalists ever did. But be warned, the two  work together.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are talking about mercantilists, again. That does not answer my question.
<BR>
You are instead trying to do a bait and switch...
