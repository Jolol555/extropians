<EM>&gt; One problem is that not only government and

<EM>&gt; hoodlums, but everyone else, lives constantly in fear of the citizenry.

<EM>&gt; I remember when I went into a jewelry store where the proprietor wore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a sidearm.  It was pretty scary knowing he could pull out his gun and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot me dead at any time.  I didn't go back.

<P>You sound here like a criminal.  When I go into a store I do not expect to so 
<BR>
p*ss off the propietor that he might shoot me!  I feel pleased that the 
<BR>
proprietor is ready, willing, and able to defend himself, his shop, his 
<BR>
goods, and his customers should some thug decide this was a good place to do 
<BR>
a holdup.  
<BR>
<P>The places I've felt safest were at the rifle range and at a gun show.  Many 
<BR>
of the folk there were armed and there were guns everywhere.  Seemed to me if 
<BR>
someone got crazy with guns (s)he wouldn't stand much of a chance.   Which is 
<BR>
fine with me.
