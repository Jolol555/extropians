</EM><BR>
<P>This is a very helpful paper and provides a good background for
<BR>
understanding the Nature paper, which I think is quite misleading.
<BR>
<P>It is curious that the Nature paper consistently uses the term
<BR>
&quot;superluminal&quot;, when their data shows the far more dramatic effect of
<BR>
a *negative* velocity.  A negative velocity is one where the output
<BR>
comes out before the input went in.  It can be considered not just
<BR>
faster than light, but faster than infinity.
<BR>
<P>For example, they say, &quot;this means that a light pulse propagating through
<BR>
the atomic vapour cell appears at the exit side so much earlier than if it
<BR>
had propagated the same distance in a vacuum that the peak of the pulse
<BR>
appears to leave the cell before entering it.&quot;  The comparison here to
<BR>
vacuum propagation is meaningless.  The peak of the pulse *does* appear
<BR>
to leave the cell before entering it - not just when compared to c, but
<BR>
independent of any velocity comparisons.  Over and over we see the paper
<BR>
couching results in terms of comparisons to the speed of light, when in
<BR>
fact they are dealing with results that appear to propagate into the past.
<BR>
<P>I think the authors are trying to present their results in this way
<BR>
in order to make them seem less dramatic, and thereby to make their
<BR>
explanation seem more plausible.  They claim that this result is simply
<BR>
due to classical effects of interference between frequencies.  They also
<BR>
claim (and here they are really wrong) that the shape of the pulse is
<BR>
preserved.
<BR>
<P>In fact, as the quant-ph paper referenced above makes clear, the shape
<BR>
of the pulse is not and cannot be preserved.  This becomes especially
<BR>
obvious if we consider a larger version of the experiment.  Instead of
<BR>
6 cm of gas, let's suppose we could build a chamber 6 meters long.
<BR>
Now the negative velocity region will be 100 times larger, giving the
<BR>
pulse a 6 us advance rather than 60 ns.  That's the same as the width
<BR>
of the pulse itself!
<BR>
<P>The question then immediately arises, if this would really work (as
<BR>
the Nature paper seems to imply), what would happen if you built a
<BR>
feedback system which upon receiving the time-advanced pulse, cut off
<BR>
the transmission of the original pulse, which hasn't even started yet?
<BR>
<P>The quant-ph paper analyzes essentially this scenario, and unsurprisingly
<BR>
it shows that nothing bad happens.  In fact, the output pulse does
<BR>
*not* depend on the shape of the input pulse.  Rather, it is in effect
<BR>
*extrapolating* the pulse shape based on the amount of input it has seen
<BR>
so far.  If you try to do the feedback, the change in the input pulse
<BR>
causes the output pulse to go into a damped oscillation.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, the front of the output pulse cannot be superluminally
<BR>
advanced over the front of the input pulse (the Nature paper does mention
<BR>
this at the very end, but they don't explain that it contradicts their
<BR>
earlier explanation of what is happening).  This is not very apparent in
<BR>
the present data, where the acceleration is only about 1% of pulse width,
<BR>
but if we scale the experiment up, it will become glaringly obvious.
<BR>
With the 100 fold expanded version of the experiment, there is no way to
<BR>
have a reasonably shaped pulse which is 6 us advanced over the source, but
<BR>
which also has its front not advanced at all over the source.  What you
<BR>
will get is a completely misshapen pulse, probably with a rapid rise,
<BR>
or perhaps some of the nonlinear ringing behavior shown in the quant-ph
<BR>
paper Scerir references above.
<BR>
<P>To sum up, in the Nature experiment, the pulse shape can and does
<BR>
change because the front cannot be advanced.  This doesn't show up very
<BR>
much on their current data but would become obvious if the experiment
<BR>
were scaled up.  The explanation in terms of classical interference
<BR>
is misleading as it implies that scaling up the experiment would lead
<BR>
to further advanced pulses, which it would not; it would just lead to
<BR>
misshapen pulses.  The quant-ph paper offers a much more coherent and
<BR>
lucid explanation of what is going on.
