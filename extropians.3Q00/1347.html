<EM>&gt; In the face of recent news, its sometimes hard to be optimistic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whatever happened to private e-cash?  You know, that thing that was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promoted optimistically within extropian circles.  It seems everyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried it folded up.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, as mentioned the Chaum ecash experiment was not successful as
<BR>
a business.  There is a new effort, www.ecashtechnologies.com, which
<BR>
purchased the patents and is trying again, this time in partnership with
<BR>
Deutsche Bank 24, a subsidiary of the big German bank.
<BR>
<P>In addition, ZeroKnowledge.com, a cypherpunk-founded privacy company
<BR>
which is selling a strong anonymity communication product called Freedom,
<BR>
recently licensed an alternate set of patents from Stefan Brands which
<BR>
could be used for anonymous payment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Worse still, people like the Dept of the Treasury,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IRS, World Bank and others are actively attempting to prohibit its use.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't believe this is true, in terms of the specific businesses
<BR>
which are attempting to popularize these technologies.  There are no
<BR>
prohibitions that I am aware of against the Ecash Technologies payment
<BR>
system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But even it were legal, most organizations capable of implementing it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have no interest in doing so - like Visa, MC, American Express.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would rather our transactions remain open to scrutiny for marketing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe they are responding to market pressures.  Most people don't care
<BR>
that much about having third parties have records of their transactions.
<BR>
Note the popularity of merchant &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards which offer
<BR>
discounts in return for tracking the purchasing behavior of the customers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course some people will say &quot;Hey, now we have HavenCo&quot;.  But just the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other day, one of its chief engineers was barred from entering the UK.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not optimistic this company will last very long.
</EM><BR>
<P>I too see HavenCo as a slim reed on which to hang our entire hopes
<BR>
for freedom.  At best it can be only a small part of a large picture.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe I'm missing the big picture here.  Does anybody think overall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual liberty is increasing, particularly for US Citizens, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decreasing?  Please be as specific as possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>The trends you have identified do not actually represent a loss of
<BR>
liberty.  It is not the case that technologies which were widely used
<BR>
for freedom have been shut down.  Rather, preemptive steps are being
<BR>
taken to maintain control and to close out some of the opportunities
<BR>
which would have existed if no such steps were taken.
<BR>
<P>This represents a failure in previous prediction models, in that they
<BR>
assumed a static, unresponsive opponent which would not be aware of the
<BR>
changes and would just stand by while things happened.  This is related
<BR>
to the point I made recently, that in our own models of future changes,
<BR>
whether in nanotech, ai or uploading, we must realize that these changes
<BR>
will be fully anticipated by those who may oppose them.  Those interests
<BR>
will take whatever steps are available to them to attempt to control
<BR>
what happens.  Successful predictions will not assume the status quo.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless the picture is not entirely bleak today.  There are steps
<BR>
forward; for example the continued liberalization of encryption policy
<BR>
in the US over the last few years (a new relaxation is to be announced
<BR>
tomorrow).  Encryption technology is much more widely available than it
<BR>
was a few years ago.  (However it is still not used much.)  Cypherpunks
<BR>
are going commercial, as with the Zero Knowledge products, PGP.com,
<BR>
even HavenCo has a significant cypherpunk contribution.
<BR>
<P>As you move forward from potentiality into reality, inevitably some
<BR>
possibilities are lost.  E-cash will not happen in the way that it
<BR>
might have been imagined ten years ago.  However there are still paths
<BR>
by which privacy can be achieved.
