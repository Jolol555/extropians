<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt;Capitalism, or free markets, is the solution. The problems stem from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt;Marxism's 'followers'...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Capitalism is no more a solution than Socialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Both are ideologies that had their peak in the 19th century, and are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; looking more than a little dated now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, the word capitalism has been Orwelled into something else, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; let us use &quot;free markets&quot; instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Socialism is currently the leading &quot;ideology&quot; of the world: every country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a fiat-currency central bank, public education and a debt/welfare system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Here's a different perspective:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1. ... Both lead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inevitably to ruling cliques where both resources and political power are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; heavily concentrated. Put simply, the more predatory (and often paranoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and insecure) humans tend to dominate the ecology. This is bad not for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; moral reasons, but simply because it's *wasteful*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just so. It is unfortunate but not inevitable, that the scum rises to the top.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 3. Both capitalism and socialism are forms of rationing, rather than forms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of cultural individuation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rationing, or rather the distribution of available resources, is an essential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quality of any organism, including an economy. Free markets using real money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the most efficient form of rationing that has yet been conceived. &quot;Real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money&quot; means a commodity that cannot be duplicated or created out of thin air.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A command economy, by issuing currency from nowhere, distorts the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price-discovery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanism that is critical for effective rationing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Socialism damps the growth curve by instituting a reign of intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mediocrity which stifles change.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Capitalism over-stokes the growth curve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The business cycle, or boom-bust cycle, appears to be an artifact of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fractional-reserve lending, or fiat-currency issue. The same dynamic was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparent at least a far back as the South Seas Bubble of 1721-3 (?).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and hides its fallout by shunting it to a slave underclass (such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sweatshop workers in the 3rd world) and by playing games with illusory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fiat-money which has no physical foundation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fiat &quot;money&quot; issued by a central bank is the antithesis of a free market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and therefore of &quot;capitalism&quot;. It is a form of command economy, which is why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Marx advocated it. A truely free market will either have free banking, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preferably no fractional reserve lending banks whatsoever. This of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires a modicum of education among traders as to the history and nature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of banking and money, which is entirely absent in the government-approved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; textbooks used in US public schools. This greatest of cons can only be pulled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the ignorant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For an excellent introduction to banking then and now, see

<EM>&gt; particularly Arisotle and Aragorn III
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the high-test, see ORO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 4. As for free markets - until such time as the planet's GNP is so huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that rationing becomes irrelevant,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is not a possibility.

<P>The Credit Bubble Bulletin    - by Doug Noland 
<BR>
&nbsp;On the Manipulation of Money and Credit
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;September 1, 2000
<BR>
“Sooner or later, the crisis must break out as the result of a change in the
<BR>
conduct of the banks.  The later the crack-up comes, the longer the period
<BR>
in which the calculation of the entrepreneurs is misguided by the issue of
<BR>
additional fiduciary media (i.e., banknotes and checking accounts not fully
<BR>
backed by money).   The greater this additional quantity of fiduciary
<BR>
money, the more factors of production have been firmly committed in the
<BR>
form of investments which appeared profitable only because of the
<BR>
artificially reduced interest rate and which prove to be unprofitable now
<BR>
that the interest rate has again been raised.  Great losses are sustained
<BR>
as a result of misdirected capital investments.” Ludwig von Mises, Von
<BR>
Mises on the Manipulation of Money and Credit.
<BR>
...
<BR>
Instead of understanding that a negative savings rate is indicative of a
<BR>
severely distorted bubble economy, the bullish consensus sees the
<BR>
continued borrowing and spending binge as evidence of a sound and
<BR>
stable prosperity.  It is this momentous gap between the perceived
<BR>
supreme health of the current environment and the actual reality of
<BR>
massive financial and economic imbalances that is disturbingly
<BR>
reminiscent of the bubbles of 1929 in the U.S., 1989 in Japan, and 1996 in
<BR>
SE Asia.
