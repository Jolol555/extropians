<EM>&gt; &gt;Even if not, there are ways to get about, and there could be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;online web service where people can check in their albums when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they are not listening to them, with a priority to check them back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;out personally when they would, thus that there could be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;completely legal online music lending library with distributed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;contributors, if there isn't already.  Badda boom, badda bing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps. The big question in my mind is &quot;didn't Napster run this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past some lawyers? What were they thinking?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>With lawyers like David Boies, I imagine they figured that if he could get
<BR>
Clinton off, he could get them off... ;)
<BR>
<P>Ross's idea is sound, where people have legally purchased copies of their music
<BR>
downloaded to their system. If they want to make it available to all (and make
<BR>
some money off of late return fees), they need to use an app that not only
<BR>
uploads the single copy of the music to the library server, but maintains some
<BR>
sort of 'overlord' log of all activity using that music file on the persons
<BR>
system, so they could not upload it to the library if there is a record of them
<BR>
retaining a copy on a backup tape, CDR, floppy, etc. The app would allow them to
<BR>
'check out' music files that are properly licensed, and the library server can
<BR>
only allow as many downloads as it has legal licenses for. Users that don't
<BR>
return the files they downloaded on time pay late fees, which are split between
<BR>
the library server company and whoever purchased the original file and made it
<BR>
available to the public on the server (which could be the server company, a
<BR>
music listener, or even the artist or his recording company). In this case, an
<BR>
artist or recording company could presumably make 1000 licenses available to the
<BR>
server library, and make money off of late fees. Users that incur late fees are
<BR>
given the option by email to either return the music, pay the late fees to hold
<BR>
onto the music for x amount of time, or buy the music license outright.
<BR>
<P>THIS could potentially be a money making dot com idea, although I am concerned
<BR>
about news that Napster has distributed its server source code over the net and
<BR>
others are now setting up their own servers elsewhere to run independent of
<BR>
Napster and US Courts.
