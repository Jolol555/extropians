<P>Yes - If it's a competitive games, rather than a experiment in
<BR>
collaborative lucid dreaming, I suppose you do need some system of
<BR>
constraints enforced by some disinterested 3rd party.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I agree that players should have the ability to design new graphics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and objects, or even new places - but for this to occur in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment such as the one above, one would need a dedicated user
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design system, built on a foundation of the publication of in-game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object properties and a strong set of rules, whereby players could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; submit their inventions for review by a 'game upgrade team'.  If an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object is accepted, it must be uploaded into all of the servers (so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; player X with object Y doesn't mysteriously lose object Y when he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crosses into another server) and would probably be uploaded to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; players' machines in the form of auto-patches on connection with the
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe there's some middle ground: Perhaps you let players write whatever
<BR>
code they want, but you place restrictions on what API's they're allowed
<BR>
to call and what arguments they're allowed to pass.  Like a system of
<BR>
permissions: root can call anything he wants, but if sword wants to call
<BR>
wound(), then the parameter it passes must be in the range allowed by the
<BR>
server-side 'wound-permissions' database. Permissions cost money - it
<BR>
costs you N credits to load an object and give it wound(0..M) permissions
<BR>
- so you create a market for conjoured/contructed swords, or anything else
<BR>
(magic portals, flying carpets) that does something not allowed by the
<BR>
defaults. Idk - just a thought.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; game servers, as part of an 'update schedule'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All of this assumes that you want the 'original game world' to be uniform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for your global user base.  No doubt if the game is open source, the players
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are going to create their own little virtual worlds. I really like this idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too, but if this is where you (now were getting to 'we', because this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what Wil and I have been talking about:) want to take it, what you'd really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to be designing is not necessarily a game, but a object-oriented game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design program and the engines to run it.  Like an 'Adventure Construction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Set' (first implemented by Electronic Arts back in my Commodore 64 days -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loved that game.)
</EM><BR>
<P>ACS! I remember playing with ACS on an Apple II, back when I was in
<BR>
grade school. It was really very clever - I remember painting my own
<BR>
tiles, inventing my own objects, etc. I don't remember...  could you
<BR>
write your own tunes, or did you just get to pick from the ones it
<BR>
shipped with? I remember copying a bunch of tiles from Ultima 5... 
<BR>
<P>A modernized, networked multiplayer ACS is a truly noble endeavor. I
<BR>
salute you.
