<EM>&gt; &gt;   Australian Gun Ban Proved Disastrous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Dr. Miguel Faria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Monday, June 26, 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Last August, the rugged Aussie survivalist whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [snip snip snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Impressive stats about the increase in crime. Of course, the &quot;center right&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberal party has been in govt for quite a while now, dismantling lots and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lots and lots of social welfare stuff; but it's probably lack of guns in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hands of the mythical &quot;good guys&quot; which is causing an alleged increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime. BTW, where are the stats on teen suicides using parent's firearms,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; domestic violence incidents using firearms, etc?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, there is certainly not a ban on gun ownership, period, in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; country. It's a ban on semi &amp; fully automatic weapons, if I remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rightly. Anyone got more detail on this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Its more than that. Revolvers are also banned. Essentially, anything more than a
<BR>
one shot gun is banned, all handguns are banned. Ergo, there are no legally
<BR>
available guns that are useful for self defense.
<BR>
<P>I strongly suspect that crime in Australia and Britain will climb to Mad Max
<BR>
levels before people pull their heads out and reinstate their right and ability
<BR>
to defend themselves against the barbarians.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's one for the testosterone fueled... Of you guys that actually carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guns, how many of you have ever had to use them in any kind of self-defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situation? I realise the dead guys can't put their hands up, so we'll have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to live with a skewed result.
</EM><BR>
<P>I could use the example of my time in Panama when when we were attempting to
<BR>
arrest Noriega. I worked on jets at the air base, and as an anti-sniper security
<BR>
adjutant, I carried a rifle, because snipers would shoot at us at night from
<BR>
trees outside the perimeter. I did use my rifle in self defense in that
<BR>
situation.
