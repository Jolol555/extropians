OK, I know the Nazis were into it big time, and they weren't cool dudes.  
<BR>
But is wanting to improve the stock a bad thing?  I have a feeling that I'm 
<BR>
&quot;preaching to the choir&quot; when I say on this list that it seems like a good 
<BR>
thing to want to make humans as perfect as possible.  But it seems like 
<BR>
virtually everywhere else, the E word is as bad as the N word.  Why is that?
