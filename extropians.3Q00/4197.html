CNN reports that a study was just released that shows promise for men who
<BR>
wish that there were birth control medications for men analogous to what
<BR>
women have enjoyed for many years.  Researchers have discovered a chemical
<BR>
that, when administered orally in combination with the administering of
<BR>
testosterone implants, completely stops sperm production in men.  There are
<BR>
minor side effects such as acne, mood swings (heh heh heh - this will be an
<BR>
interesting role reversal for their partners to deal with), elevated blood
<BR>
pressure, an increase in appetite and weight gain, etc.
<BR>
<P>Less than 100 people were involved in the studies, which took place in
<BR>
several countries.  Large scale studies are expected to begin at the end of
<BR>
the year 2000.  The pharmaceutical company that manufactures this promising
<BR>
new male contraceptive (N.V. Organon in the Netherlands) says that they
<BR>
anticipate having something on the market by the year 2005.  It would be in
<BR>
the form of a pill or an implant or both.
<BR>
<P>If you are interested, you can read the entire article here:

<BR>
<P>Such a medical advance could be a great boon for men: it would allow men to
<BR>
finally have the kind of control over their bodies and financial/parental
<BR>
futures that women have been enjoying for years.  It would enable men to
<BR>
avoid the &quot;shotgun wedding&quot; situations some women get them into and to avoid
<BR>
paying child support for children they never agreed to conceive in the first
<BR>
place.  Let's hope that the pharmaceutical company can pull this one off.
