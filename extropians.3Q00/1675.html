<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a very helpful paper and provides a good background for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding the Nature paper, which I think is quite misleading.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is curious that the Nature paper consistently uses the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;superluminal&quot;, when their data shows the far more dramatic effect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a *negative* velocity.  A negative velocity is one where the output
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes out before the input went in.  It can be considered not just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster than light, but faster than infinity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>One way to look at this (it might not be the correct way) symbolically is that
<BR>
the order type Ord (the proper class of all finite and infinite integers) is
<BR>
not less than anything, or to permute the words, less than nothing.  The
<BR>
integers are still an ordered set, so in that interpretation one is negative
<BR>
&quot;Ord&quot;, and Ord negative one.
<BR>
<P>This is addressed by what is called the Burali-Forti paradox.  Burali-Forti
<BR>
says that the order type of Ord would have to be greater than Ord, yet as Ord
<BR>
(the symbolic name) contains all these numbers, that the order type of Ord
<BR>
would have to be in Ord.
<BR>
<P>So, perhaps it is not paradoxical.  My opinion of paradoxes is that none exist
<BR>
and that their qualification shows either logical inconsistency or
<BR>
misapplication of terms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example, they say, &quot;this means that a light pulse propagating through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the atomic vapour cell appears at the exit side so much earlier than if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had propagated the same distance in a vacuum that the peak of the pulse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears to leave the cell before entering it.&quot;  The comparison here to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vacuum propagation is meaningless.  The peak of the pulse *does* appear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to leave the cell before entering it - not just when compared to c, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; independent of any velocity comparisons.  Over and over we see the paper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couching results in terms of comparisons to the speed of light, when in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact they are dealing with results that appear to propagate into the past.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the authors are trying to present their results in this way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in order to make them seem less dramatic, and thereby to make their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explanation seem more plausible.  They claim that this result is simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; due to classical effects of interference between frequencies.  They also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim (and here they are really wrong) that the shape of the pulse is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, as the quant-ph paper referenced above makes clear, the shape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the pulse is not and cannot be preserved.  This becomes especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obvious if we consider a larger version of the experiment.  Instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6 cm of gas, let's suppose we could build a chamber 6 meters long.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now the negative velocity region will be 100 times larger, giving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulse a 6 us advance rather than 60 ns.  That's the same as the width
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the pulse itself!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question then immediately arises, if this would really work (as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Nature paper seems to imply), what would happen if you built a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feedback system which upon receiving the time-advanced pulse, cut off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the transmission of the original pulse, which hasn't even started yet?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The quant-ph paper analyzes essentially this scenario, and unsurprisingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it shows that nothing bad happens.  In fact, the output pulse does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *not* depend on the shape of the input pulse.  Rather, it is in effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *extrapolating* the pulse shape based on the amount of input it has seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so far.  If you try to do the feedback, the change in the input pulse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes the output pulse to go into a damped oscillation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Furthermore, the front of the output pulse cannot be superluminally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advanced over the front of the input pulse (the Nature paper does mention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this at the very end, but they don't explain that it contradicts their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earlier explanation of what is happening).  This is not very apparent in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the present data, where the acceleration is only about 1% of pulse width,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but if we scale the experiment up, it will become glaringly obvious.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; With the 100 fold expanded version of the experiment, there is no way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a reasonably shaped pulse which is 6 us advanced over the source, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which also has its front not advanced at all over the source.  What you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will get is a completely misshapen pulse, probably with a rapid rise,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or perhaps some of the nonlinear ringing behavior shown in the quant-ph
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper Scerir references above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To sum up, in the Nature experiment, the pulse shape can and does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change because the front cannot be advanced.  This doesn't show up very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much on their current data but would become obvious if the experiment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were scaled up.  The explanation in terms of classical interference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is misleading as it implies that scaling up the experiment would lead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to further advanced pulses, which it would not; it would just lead to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; misshapen pulses.  The quant-ph paper offers a much more coherent and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lucid explanation of what is going on.
</EM><BR>

<P>About the rest of this, I can not claim to understand.
<BR>
<P>Relativity and the mass/energy/lightspeed equivalence relation appears to be
<BR>
largely correct, I can't claim to have gathered empirical data, fromw hat I
<BR>
understand the most obvious proof of that is redshift.
<BR>
<P>There is much current application of Cartan's, Dirac's, Pauli's, Majorana's,
<BR>
et. alia's, mathematical explanation of many of these things, of which I can
<BR>
say little.
<BR>
<P>In my opinion, physical laws are the same throughout the entirety of the
<BR>
universe, there are just some of which we aren't aware.
