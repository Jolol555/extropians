<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The luddites are well organized, have a simple, consistent theme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;and are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;getting better and better at getting themselves insserted into every 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;news item announcing any progress.  I'm sorry to say it, but as someone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;works in the arena of public persuasion, I have to say we're losing -- and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;badly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Indeed, THEY HAVE THE AGENDA CLEAR. They know what the fight is about, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;know what methods to use, and who their enemies and their friends are. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;think it really is time to stop &quot;playing around with computers&quot; , and move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;transhumanism into a more political agenda.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;THIS IS NOT A HOBBY
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what are you suggesting? Just trying to counter them in the media?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is no sizzle to that idea. The Luddites are famous for their acts of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eco-Terrorism. Perhaps if someone were to counter their Eco-Terrorism with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acts of Counter-Eco-Terrorism. Now *that* would be newsworthy!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But they are somewhat secretive, I suppose.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, that would anyway just amount to &quot;Let's look at the lunatics beat
<BR>
up each other&quot; in the media, while the non-ecoterrorist luddites
<BR>
quietly win the game. 
<BR>
<P>What this is really about is changing the public perception not just
<BR>
about genetically modified plants, but about the future, themselves
<BR>
and technology - a quite ambitious agenda, but we have selected that
<BR>
one for ourselves by being transhumanists. It would be easier to be
<BR>
just pro-viagra or whatever, but that just means that you can win on a
<BR>
small scale while losing on the larger scale.
<BR>
<P>I think Waldemar would like us to formulate a clear agenda. WHAT DO WE
<BR>
WANT? - practically, in the next years. 
<BR>
<P>I think our list of demands/goals would be something along these lines:
<BR>
<P>* Innovation, research and technology should be free, and must not be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled or stopped by political or ideological
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;concerns. Dangerous or controversial technology can be handled
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;through other ways than coercion and banning.
<BR>
<P>* Humans should be free, not just along the traditional freedoms but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;also having morphological freedom - the freedom of altering
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves after their own wishes and abilities.
<BR>
<P>* Society should be open. It must be possible to criticise, analyse
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and debate all issues, and demand accountability of the people
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;making decisions (be they in the government, big business or the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lab).
<BR>
<P>This follows from the Extropian and Transhumanist Principles, and I
<BR>
think most of us will agree on it (there will always be some people
<BR>
who think one or more of the points are bad and that the best way of
<BR>
promoting transhumanism is technocracy, but that is their
<BR>
problem). They also have a lot of practical implications, as well as
<BR>
obvious tie-ins to many other political issues and groups. 
<BR>
<P>This suggests that as a first step we should try to connect with these
<BR>
groups, show that we support their causes and that we can provide
<BR>
valuable help (for example by being well versed in what is occuring in
<BR>
high-tech right now and having a long-range view) as well as an
<BR>
ally. We should formulate our visions clearly and express them openly,
<BR>
showing that we are not threatening elitists and that our ideas
<BR>
actually can work in the real world (unlike many of the ideas of our
<BR>
opponents - as we also ought to be able to show clearly).  (At least)
<BR>
a letter to the editor or article to a local newspaper each week would
<BR>
be a good idea for each of us.
<BR>
