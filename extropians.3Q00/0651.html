<P>
All the fanfare about completing the map of the human genome has now had the 
<BR>
inevitable response of calling forth voices demanding regulation.  We need to 
<BR>
be prepared for one possible scenario in which there is a politically-driven 
<BR>
governmental rush to regulate, with each candidate and jurisdiction trying to 
<BR>
out-do the other in proclaiming that it has &quot;taken steps&quot; to cork the bottle 
<BR>
holding the genetic genie.  It is a presidential election year here in the 
<BR>
States and this is an issue tailor-made for Al Gore's technocratic 
<BR>
tendencies.  I think there's a real chance that the political process will 
<BR>
actually get AHEAD of the science and technology here:
<BR>
<P>Genes and Dangers From the Unknown
<BR>
By Tom Delbanco
<BR>
Sunday, July 9, 2000; Page B07 
<BR>
<P>As the race to decipher the human genome ends its first phase, we are quite 
<BR>
properly amazed watching our genetic map unfold before our eyes. But it is 
<BR>
far too early to conclude that understanding our genetic substance will 
<BR>
trigger a leap forward in human &quot;progress.&quot; One thing is certain: We are not 
<BR>
spending nearly enough time or money considering how society will cope with 
<BR>
what scientists are unleashing. 
<BR>
<P>Darwin taught us that progress from survival of those organisms most fit 
<BR>
occurs over thousands of years, as nature weeds out weaknesses. Now we 
<BR>
threaten to change the human organism virtually all at once, without 
<BR>
affording the time to reach balance and harmony. As science fiction writers 
<BR>
love to speculate, we may even generate a war within our own bodies.
<BR>
<P>Might genetic interventions inadvertently trigger more trouble than success? 
<BR>
Look at the fine line between disaster and rescue that thalidomide 
<BR>
illustrates. In the past this drug disfigured newborns; now we hope it will 
<BR>
help with cancer and AIDS. Consider HIV therapy, how it alters cells and too 
<BR>
often induces resistance. Will genetically altered cells make good or bad 
<BR>
neighbors to those in adjoining tissues? Clinical investigators using 
<BR>
genetically engineered substances in Boston and Philadelphia have already 
<BR>
watched death come to patients before rescue.
<BR>
<P>Genetic knowledge will never abolish all disease and suffering, and Americans 
<BR>
don't like to address rationing explicitly. We already spend about 15 percent 
<BR>
of our gross domestic product on health care, and there is no way our 
<BR>
economic resources can keep pace with the new technologies. Virtually every 
<BR>
new diagnostic and therapeutic manipulation adds costs. The rush by 
<BR>
biotechnology companies to profit from the new genetic discoveries makes it 
<BR>
likely that the new maneuvers will be the most expensive of all, and rarely 
<BR>
do new discoveries replace existing expensive tests and interventions.
<BR>
<P>Who will have access to the new technologies and who won't? Will we end up 
<BR>
further widening the gap between rich and poor? When the United States has 45 
<BR>
million people without health insurance and many more who can't afford 
<BR>
therapies already proven worthwhile, how can we--and should we--find the 
<BR>
money for new genetic therapies that will cost a fortune?
<BR>
<P>Consider how poorly our society is dealing with the elderly, the 
<BR>
beneficiaries of extended life expectancy that scientific, behavioral and 
<BR>
social changes have already provided. As doctors urge their patients to throw 
<BR>
away cigarettes, we rarely pause to take stock of the paradox that if 
<BR>
everyone were to stop smoking tomorrow, the burden on society from increased 
<BR>
longevity could prove enormous. Take that thought a step further. If genetic 
<BR>
therapies that increase life expectancy arrived tomorrow, they might bankrupt 
<BR>
our health care system or siphon vital resources away from education, human 
<BR>
services and other essential functions of society. Are we ready to deal with 
<BR>
this kind of success?
<BR>
<P>Will mapping genes help further discrimination and loss of privacy? How will 
<BR>
society address genetic tests for health insurance, jobs and life insurance? 
<BR>
What role is there for the marketplace vs. governmental regulation? And 
<BR>
consider the next step: full-blown eugenics. In today's narcissistic society, 
<BR>
people aspire increasingly to their notion of perfection: the cherished 
<BR>
height, gender, skin color. How will we build moral consensus, a code that 
<BR>
stymies those who would create a master race or a Frankenstein?
<BR>
<P>Think about the anguish of those deciding whether to learn if they or their 
<BR>
children have genes that forecast Huntington's disease, or increase the 
<BR>
likelihood of breast cancer or dementia. Reflect on the uncertainties that 
<BR>
already attend the relatively primitive genetic tests that amniocentesis 
<BR>
offers the pregnant woman and multiply those dilemmas a thousand fold.
<BR>
<P>How will we feel when fantasies of genetic perfection are destroyed? May we 
<BR>
not end up with loss of ambition, depression or even a shattered persona? 
<BR>
Learning about one's genetic map may induce far more pain than pleasure.
<BR>
<P>What about responsibility, voluntary behaviors, the old-fashioned idea of 
<BR>
choosing right over wrong? Will we rush to &quot;blame the gene&quot; for every human 
<BR>
failure or transgression? Will genetic determinism weaken our will? Will it 
<BR>
stop our search for mystery, community, art, spirituality and the deepest 
<BR>
pleasures? Will the genetic map replace the dream?
<BR>
<P>The human quest for knowledge will never abate, and we must mobilize quickly 
<BR>
to address the consequences of what we learn. Our government, universities, 
<BR>
industry, communities, schools, clergy, ethicists and each of us must prepare 
<BR>
for some exceedingly tough decisions, lest we end up expressing ex-post-facto 
<BR>
doubts like those of the Los Alamos physicists who, having detonated an 
<BR>
atomic bomb, looked back in horror at what they had wrought.
<BR>
<P>It's time to build a national &quot;Genome Commission&quot; that is well supported, 
<BR>
broadly representative and has strong bipartisan teeth, analogous to the 
<BR>
Atomic Energy Commission, which helped us live with the consequences of 
<BR>
splitting the atom. We should also form an international counterpart that is 
<BR>
truly global in its reach.
<BR>
<P>For every dollar we spend on the genome project and the attendant frantic 
<BR>
race for discovery, we should spend an equal amount to prepare for what we 
<BR>
find. The rush for that kind of enlightenment has hardly begun.
<BR>
<P>The writer is Koplow-Tullis professor of general medicine and primary care at 
<BR>
Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
