<P><EM>&gt; Another one I thought of: low self esteem, leading

<EM>&gt; to an inability to own up to your accomplishments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you don't think that you have a lot of power over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your own life, then you would have a need to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;explain away&quot; all of your accomplishments. If your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mother is dying of cancer, and you are able to pull
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through and be there for her without going insane,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then you have to attribute this perseverence to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something besides yourself, so you pin it on God. To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a lesser extent, getting an A on the test might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thanks to God, because you prayed, and not just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because you're capable of learning the material.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's analogous to blaming your dark thoughts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions on the devil.

<P>Another good one Zeb.  Reminds me of the athletes and
<BR>
award winning musicians and actors who thank their
<BR>
deity for their success.  But I don't think these
<BR>
people generally have low self-esteem. It seems more
<BR>
like being placed in the public eye for some kind of
<BR>
achievement places one at social risk. The viewing
<BR>
public is vigilant for signs of arrogance and anything
<BR>
less than a graceful acceptance leads to social
<BR>
disapproval. Thanking god for your award is a clever
<BR>
social tactic. You appear humble by not taking all the
<BR>
credit yourself and at the same time you suggest that
<BR>
there's something about you that made god want you to
<BR>
win.
<BR>
<P>I once heard a comedian quip about how athletes never
<BR>
blame Jesus when they lose. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;...Freakin' Jesus let us down out there today. I
<BR>
think the other team just out-prayed us. We're going
<BR>
to have to start drafting from more Christian
<BR>
Colleges.&quot;
