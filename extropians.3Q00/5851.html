<EM>&gt; &gt; One of the great things about libertarianism is consent. I don't care if YOU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; want to live in a repressive communal society, so long as you don't force ME to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do the same, or if I want to try it out, you can't force me to stay if I change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; my mind. The consent of the individual in all matters is its core ethic, and one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that I think that extropy shares. Any philosophy that shares that ethic as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can peacefully co-exist and co-operate with libertarians and a libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; society. If you can accept that, then you really should not have any trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with extropy OR libertarianism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You talk of your problems with implementation of libertarianism, but you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not stated what your problems are with such implementation. Do you think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people should be allowed to force others to do what they do not wish to do? Do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you mistakenly think that libertarians would initiate force to make others live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as libertarians wish to? Please explain....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My problems are really three-fold here as to specifics.  #1:  I'v ebrought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up the environmental issue before.  Group A may wish to simply be left alone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but they're deforesting a hillside above Group B's settlement, causing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; water to be fouled and increasing the damage of floods in the springtime.  To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fix the flood problem, Group B builds a dam to moderate flooding - but now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Group C isn't getting enough water.  How do you resolve this in a libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion, if negotiation fails?
</EM><BR>
<P>Under even a diverse PPL system, you are still dealing with simple issues of
<BR>
externalities in a complex system. Negotiation should only fail when one group
<BR>
refuses to to act in a Baysean manner. In such a case, it is those who fail to
<BR>
negotiate that are already using force to steal or damage the property of
<BR>
others, so using force to negate the previously initiated force is fully
<BR>
justified.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #2:  Not everyone will play by the &quot;non-coercive&quot; rule.  Simply look at how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; powerful a memetic structure religion is.  I would love to be left alone - but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a group of people reading one of a handful of passages from Leviticus suddenly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gets this idea that I am less deserving to live than they are.  One of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tradeoffs in modern western political systems is that this sort of activity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mostly curtailed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Libertarianism only requires the non-initiation of force. If someone else has
<BR>
initiated force, then either the individual, his agents, or the community he
<BR>
belongs to is justified in responding with force that is appropriate to the
<BR>
situation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; #3:  Markets are wonderful, btu I doubt withotu a regulatory regime that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be as resistant to fraud and manipulation as they are now.  Market-based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems work, but I don't know if I could trust a mechanism that operates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the honor system to play such a vital role in my life
</EM><BR>
<P>This concern I think is based on history, such as 1929, etc. where significant
<BR>
fraud took place. However, there were no oversight systems of any kind in place
<BR>
then. Libertarians expect that given that mechanisms like those exercised by the
<BR>
SEC have shown value, they stabilize markets AND increase confidence in values,
<BR>
but there is no reason why those mechanisms cannot be run independent of
<BR>
government, much like Consumers Union.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The other issue here is the ability of a libertarian society or culture to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resist the influence of a better organized, more coercive society.  My concern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is less the libertarian society acting in a physically coercive way (One could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argue abot memetic coercion, such as a proselytizing meme, but I don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how that fits into a libertarian view) but more a non-libertarian society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acting in a coercive manne rtowards the libertarian one.  The closest thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have to a guattantor that this won't happen is the presence of nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; devices, and to a lesser extent the ability to locate in a place beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traditional borders and geographic pressures (i.e. space)
</EM><BR>
<P>A libertarian society I think could resist a more coercive society very well.
<BR>
What it could not do is act agressively toward a more coercive society. So long
<BR>
as the libertarians keep on their own turf, they would typically have the
<BR>
advantage, as any guerrilla would.
<BR>
<P>MAD would likely act as a good deterrent in a libertarian society against a more
<BR>
coercive society. Keeping nukes out of the hands of nuts is still possible in
<BR>
such a society through the PPL system, if you accept the proposition that one
<BR>
person's ownership of a nuke involves them externalizing some sort of cost
<BR>
(being a target risk, pollution, etc) on their neighbors, then any PPL insurer
<BR>
would mandate that it retains those rights for all of its customers.
