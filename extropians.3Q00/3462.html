<EM>&gt;It's not that I don't agree that there could have possibly been a better way to sort this out. I simply did not foresee the fury I created, and for this I am sorry. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I for one do not understand how you could not have foreseen the &quot;fury&quot; that you created.  To not foresee the reaction appears to me to be the height of ignorance, when it is obvious that many of the individuals on the list are colleagues/Friends or at least admire Mr. More and the things he has accomplished.  This is after all the extropian mailing list, and the Extropy institute was in fact started by Max More.  If it is not ignorance on your part then it demonstrates a frightening lack of empathy to be so surprised at the reactions.
<BR>
<P>The action that you took was simply mean spirited, and could serve no redeeming purpose.  I read your statement and I am sorry if you do not see it but it is tantamount to accusing an individual that we respect of a heinous crime.  Not only was it rude of you to do so, it was extremely innappropriate.  Imagine if in a public forum someone accused you of (random horrific act inserted here).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If the rumor is false, and if Mr More is not in support of such behavior, all that is necessary is a clear statement to that effect, not retaliation for an imagined wrong. All this excitement only makes me wonder...
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a ridiculous request.  Yes or No &quot;Mr. Miller&quot;, have you stopped beating your wife?  Your tactics are cheap and insulting, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  If the best you can come up with is rumor then you ought to keep silent.  If you have evidence (which you stated that you have none) then you ought to go to the police.  Any other action is nothing more than a poor attempt at a smear campaign.
<BR>
<P>I for one have no respect for you or your tactics Jamiro.
<BR>
It is for this reason I have chosen not to respond to your unfounded accusation in regards to Mr. More, and have instead only spoken to your tactics.
<BR>
