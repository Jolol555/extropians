<P><EM> &gt; Please be patient with me. What do you mean by mature uploads?
</EM><BR>
<P>An immature upload is a full-detail emulation of a human's low-level
<BR>
neuronal processes (at, say, compartmental emulation level) based on a 
<BR>
data set more or less imediately derived from digitized
<BR>
neuroanatomy. Apart from being potentially immortal and having
<BR>
a radically expanded control of itself and it's (rendered)
<BR>
surroundings it is very human.
<BR>
<P>A mature upload is something which has made extensive edits to the
<BR>
above dataset (or is derived from above original dataset in a
<BR>
darwinian fashion), and is encoded in a fashion which runs more
<BR>
efficiently on the (computronium) hardware (both the hardware and the
<BR>
encoding will have to undergo several optimization steps for this to
<BR>
succeed). It is much faster than an immature upload (operates on a
<BR>
time scale 10^3..10^6 faster than we), and requires a fraction of its
<BR>
resources to operate.
<BR>
<P>Another definition is that a population of mature AIs can't get
<BR>
snuffed out by AIs created by evolutionary algorithms. They can
<BR>
persist in a stable equilibrium with them (nice trick, that).
<BR>
<P>There is supposedly a traversable development trajectory from immature
<BR>
to mature. Since it's unlikely any of us will be a player in that
<BR>
game, we will be essentially dependant on their freely flowing milk of
<BR>
posthuman kindness for 1) protecting us from AIs 2) not snuff us out
<BR>
instead of AIs
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; (And what's wrong with letting the Amish go extinct?)
</EM><BR>

<BR>
In principle, nothing. However, being human, I would object. 
<BR>
<P>They should be given a choice, those who reject the choice I would
<BR>
still upload by force (now things do become ethically iffy), erasing
<BR>
their short-term memory of what just happened and given an illusion of
<BR>
subjective continuity of existance. As long as I can spare the
<BR>
resources, they would be free to pursue what they did before, of
<BR>
course being given opportunities to leave their self-imposed seclusion
<BR>
at any step of the game, and certainly if/when I can't afford the
<BR>
resources.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; So we should speed the occurrence of mature uploads. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. I think in 10-15 years we should be able to make individually
<BR>
realistic computational models of nematodes, provided we establish and
<BR>
fund a large project now. After that, you have to scale this up to
<BR>
higher animals in a series of steps. (E.g. C. elegans,
<BR>
D. melanogaster, &lt;some suitable intermediate here&gt;, M. musculus,
<BR>
H. sapiens).
<BR>
<P>Once we can simulate nematodes, perhaps people will start seeing value
<BR>
in developing means for vitrifying brains of terminal and freshly dead
<BR>
people right in the here and now. Meanwhile, several thousands of
<BR>
people per hour will be continuing dying irreversibly while we will
<BR>
continue waffling about AI, SI, nanotechnology, and properties of
<BR>
metallic xenon and unicorns, and whether their horns are really
<BR>
Mohs&gt;10.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; (I need to know what a mature upload is first.)
