<EM>&gt;&gt;Paperwork and lobbying won't necessarily do the job if people are morally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;opposed to the project.  Look at the genetically modified food issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;we have been discussing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, but is it so clear what the directions of people's &quot;moral&quot; dispositions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are in this case?  To march against violation of cryonics patients, people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would have to accept cryonics patients as being alive, and therefor that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been killing most of the elderly humanity for many decades.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Here's an argument I won't be surprised to see demagogues make:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't know yet whether it is possible to truly revive cryonics
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patients. We need to do more research before doing anything irreversable
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to them. It is cruel to create an uploaded being that contains some of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those cryonics patients' humanity, but is missing a soul [or qualia,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adequate sensory input, some possibly important memories, the vital force,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc].
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;If the value of human labor could lose trillions of dollars, it is hard
<BR>
to see what could counter that motivation if it were happening today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  To march
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against upload working conditions, people would have to accept machines as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conscious, as well as think of upload VR palaces as miserable places.  There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems to be far more basis to let people think of uploads as inhuman as there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ever was to think of black slaves as inhuman.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I.e. it would probably end up like what the animal rights movement would
<BR>
be if animals were qualified to do many human jobs. I'd guess that if animals
<BR>
suddenly became able to replace 30 or 40 percent of human labor, that the
<BR>
animal rights movement would succeed in creating enough moral revulsion to
<BR>
animal labor to outlaw virtually all animal labor worldwide.
<BR>
&nbsp;I can't figure out how long such a prohibition would remain enforceable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I wasn't talking about secrecy, just keeping it out of people's faces.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;People seem to accept &quot;taking advantage&quot; of others in all sorts of ways as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long as it isn't vivid to them.  People give to panhandlers and say no to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mailed charity letters.  People happily buy products from foreigners working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in conditions they would be outraged to see their neighbors working in.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;If many other people are already buying those foreign products, each
<BR>
additional consumer realizes that he can't have much effect on the
<BR>
conditions those foreigners are working under and won't be ostracized
<BR>
for making purchases that differ from his peers. Consumers who are
<BR>
thinking of being among the first to buy a controversial product have
<BR>
more trouble rationalizing away moral concerns.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Plus, what are the odds that the destructive upload is going to work,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;first time?  Most things don't.  A number of people are going to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;killed before you get an upload that works.  The moral opposition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;such an effort would be overwhelming, especially when it comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;people who will be put out of work if it succeeds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Again to get upset about the destruction of a frozen head you had to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accept it as alive in the first place.  And the risk of a destructive
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;I.e. you are claiming that people would never get upset over things
<BR>
like digging up graves?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;scan failing to pick up the relevant info is different from the risk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of any one simluation not being tuned right.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;It should be easy to create controversy over what info is relevant.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;All you need is the greens convincing people that &quot;services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;provided by *real* people&quot; are better&quot; and you are in a situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;where the market demand for upload slave labor goes soft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is crazy.  Why don't people solve other problems by just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;convincing everyone to prefer third world labor, rain forest labor,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disabled labor, animal labor, or &quot;socialist&quot; labor?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Those particular examples are weak because it is doubtfull whether there
<BR>
is much motivation for those rules.
<BR>
&nbsp;I look at movements to repudiate slavery, child labor, human cloning,
<BR>
and genetically modified foods and see a much more mixed picture than you do.
<BR>
&nbsp;I expect that important factors that affecting the enforceability of such
<BR>
rules are how easy it is to observe violations of it and how deep the
<BR>
pockets of the typical violator are. The first upload attempts will make
<BR>
big headlines unless unusual efforts are made to keep it secret. It will
<BR>
be much harder than with racism or child labor for a company that creates
<BR>
the first upload to confuse consumers by denying any violation or claiming
<BR>
it was unintentional.
<BR>
&nbsp;For these reasons, I expect that social pressure will delay uploading,
<BR>
although I can't predict by how much. It seems likely that advances in
<BR>
AI, even if they haven't come close to the Turing-test level, will
<BR>
replace steadily increasing fractions of human labor in ways that will
<BR>
make it obvious that preventing uploads will not protect human wages
<BR>
forever.
<BR>
&nbsp;And I hope that people will realize that a powerfull AI that has been
<BR>
created without human instincts will be more dangerous to humans than an
<BR>
upload which retains most human instincts, and that it would be safer
<BR>
to have the power of those AIs balanced by comparable powererfull uploads.
