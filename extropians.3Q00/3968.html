<EM>&gt; Overall, I believe markets *are* better than centralized planning. I

<EM>&gt; doubt that at our current level of technological and economic

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the board. However, I think everything can be debugged, and that's what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm trying to do with the concept of free markets. I'm not good at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; noticing bugs in this case, because I'm so immersed in free market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think. I'm hoping to get some input from others on...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) Flaws in how other market systems were implemented.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have heard it said that Soviet style central planning probably could have
<BR>
worked if they only had a few good supercomputers and a nationwide network to
<BR>
manage everything. Don't know bout that, because as far as I see it, the primary
<BR>
problem with such system is that the threat of force causes underlings to lie
<BR>
when feeding information up the line, and the pressure of propaganda needs
<BR>
mandate that the leadership lie about both the acheivements of the last five
<BR>
years, and the goals of the next five years...
<BR>
<P>No business plan survives contact with the market. Think about it. As one writer
<BR>
in, I think, either Worth Magazine, or in Business 2.0, said recently, every
<BR>
successful internet company is now in the fifth year of every five year plan
<BR>
written in 1995. How many of those do you think are obsolete? How many were
<BR>
obsolete within two years?
<BR>
<P>There is also the problem of perceptions of value. The market works because it
<BR>
allows parties to negotiate a common sense of value. Any system that allows
<BR>
parties to freely negotiate common perceptions of value is, by definition, a
<BR>
free market system.
<BR>
<P>Is this in fact the optimum system? As far as the individuals are concerned,
<BR>
based on their self interest, yes (except for those individuals who think that
<BR>
negotiation = getting screwed). As far as the long term best interest of those
<BR>
individuals, this is debatable. Is the fact that people waste billions of
<BR>
dollars on beanie babies a good thing or not? Some think that the consumer
<BR>
economy wastes large amounts of capital, work, and resources that could be
<BR>
'better used' on development of infrastructure, technological advancement,
<BR>
etc... these people also seem to be believers in the myth of absolute limits on
<BR>
resources.
