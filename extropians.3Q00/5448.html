We are at the realm of weird science. I seem to remember that this thread was 
<BR>
originally about how author, Rudy Rucker, came up with the concept of 
<BR>
clonning an electromagnetic version of a personality and then sending the 
<BR>
A.I. proggie off onto the cosmos. The book is Saucer Wisdom. My only caveat 
<BR>
was that there was danger from interference by other em sources, also 
<BR>
gravity, also gas clouds. Kids don't try this at home. Neutrino's, because 
<BR>
they penetrate nearly everthing, seem to be a great candidate for such and 
<BR>
endevour. My hope is by the time such interstellar journeys are seriously 
<BR>
considered we will be well into the krasnikov-wormhole era.

&nbsp;&quot;Most people think Star Trek has solved the problem of faster-than-light
<BR>
&nbsp;travel. I am much more fascinated by Star Trek's solution to the
<BR>
&nbsp;sound-in-a-vacuum problem.&quot;

&nbsp;On a more serious note, are we really sure that neutrinos can't be used for
<BR>
&nbsp;communication?  Suppose you had some way to aim the neutrino beam almost
<BR>
&nbsp;perfectly, correcting for gravitational influences, so that you can pour a
<BR>
&nbsp;beam into a 1mm-diameter cup orbiting another star.  Suppose that you also
<BR>
&nbsp;fire off a million neutrinos in a perfect two-dimensional grid, each neutrino
<BR>
&nbsp;an infinitesimal bit to the side of the previous one, so that at least one
<BR>
&nbsp;neutrino in the pattern is guaranteed to hit any atomic nucleus inside the
<BR>
&nbsp;pattern's radius.  Fire the beam at a crystal where the atomic spacing is 
<BR>
less
<BR>
&nbsp;than the pattern diameter, and at least one neutrino is guaranteed to hit. 
<BR>
&nbsp;The result could be an interstellar radio that shines effortlessly through 
<BR>
any
<BR>
&nbsp;amount of dust.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I have no idea whether this makes any sense from a physicist's perspective,
<BR>
&nbsp;but my guess is &quot;NO&quot;.  The basic assumption seems to be that a really
<BR>
&nbsp;perfectly aimed neutrino can be deliberately made to be absorbed by an atom,
<BR>
&nbsp;and I don't know whether the penetrating quality of neutrinos derives from 
<BR>
the
<BR>
&nbsp;improbability of a perfect hit, or the improbability of absorption in any hit
<BR>
&nbsp;(glancing or otherwise).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Is a detector made of neutronium more likely to get hit?  Could you reverse
<BR>
&nbsp;the patterned-neutrino theory and use patterned neutronium to guarantee a
<BR>
&nbsp;hit?  Or is that just not the way quantum neutridynamics work?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Neutrino-neutronium radio... ought to be a pun here...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;This makes a nice little dialogue for a post-Singularity novel:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;You communicate with Andromeda?  How?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, we send out a sequence of neutrinos; a neutrino strikes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a chlorine atom and turns it into argon, that's a 'one'...&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;But can't a neutrino pass through ten light-years of lead
<BR>
&nbsp;without being absorbed?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We aim them really carefully.&quot;
