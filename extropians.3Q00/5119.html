<EM>&gt;From: Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Homeless&In-Reply-To=&lt;LAW2-F63gbU76j1KQj30000183c@hotmail.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The will-work-for-fooders stand out there on the corner,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with all limbs in apparent working condition, while Burger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;King is *crying out* for someone willing to just push a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;mop and wipe tables.  And they will hire *anyone* no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;questions asked, dog kickers, mass murderers, whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;They hire the mentally retarded, but oddly enough, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;arent enough of them either.  And the fast food gets steadily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;slower, because there arent enough people working the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;kitchen.  Meanwhile the floors and tables get ever dirtier.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a very real problem at all levels of the economy.  The solution at 
<BR>
the top is to keep raising the wages, with management - no matter how 
<BR>
incompetent - getting astronomical money with noone noticing that they are 
<BR>
usually the least competent people in the company.
<BR>
<P>The next teir down - the engineers, researchers, etc. - who actually do most 
<BR>
of the work and actually make most of the decisions that management takes 
<BR>
credit for and gets paid for, have gotten very slight monetary increases, 
<BR>
and huge increases in work load.  The next level - the blue collar and white 
<BR>
collar grunts who mostly just &quot;do a job&quot; - have gotten less than nothing in 
<BR>
pay increases in real buying terms for over a decade now, even as their 
<BR>
productivity has skyrocketed, and the hours have gone up as well.
<BR>
<P>So now we are seeing the result.  The idiots we often see in management that 
<BR>
get huge salaries no matter how badly they perform - maybe because the other 
<BR>
guys, also in management, authorize these increases, knowing that if one 
<BR>
manager gets a raise then all eventually have to to remain competitive (all, 
<BR>
including them) are starting to reap their just rewards - eg., Firestone. 
<BR>
(And note that Firestone managed to top its own original idiocy by failing 
<BR>
to set up secure verification of returned tires, so that now people have 
<BR>
been reselling the same defective tires just so that the buyer can go to his 
<BR>
or her tire dealer and get a complete set of new tires for free (at 
<BR>
Firestone's expense).)  Hint to Bridgestone - bust every Firestone manager 
<BR>
back to the work floor and move the workers into management.  Let the 
<BR>
workers elect the new managers.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, the engineers, etc., are getting damned tired of 80 hour work 
<BR>
weeks without corresponding pay, so they are burning out and quiting in 
<BR>
large numbers.  And the grunts are starting to listen to the union 
<BR>
organizers.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Engineering teams dissolve because the young PhDs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cannot afford the rent.  Those who argue that National
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Missile Defense is an impossible task never do site the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;*real* most difficult hurdle facing it: keeping teams together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in areas that are too expensive for those working the project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;For those who have managed to acquire a home, of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it is like winning the lottery in slow motion.
</EM><BR>
<P>In many urban areas, such as Los Angeles or Orange County, a lot of people 
<BR>
have found that they can live at work very cheaply.  At the same time that 
<BR>
housing cost have gone thru the roof, business space has been getting 
<BR>
cheaper or going up much more slowly.  In most areas, this is illegal, of 
<BR>
course, but that doesn't stop people.  Some people actually switch around 
<BR>
day to day between two or more offices to disguise the fact that they are 
<BR>
sleeping there - and it's still less expensive than an apartment.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So here in Silicon Valley we see a foretaste of a future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in which wealth is distributed ever more based on technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ability and insight, steadily less on the number of hours worked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I can see that what must happen here is that the techno-have-nots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;must abandon the valley, being replaced in the short run by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;commuters from the outlying areas, these being replaced in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the long run by androids.  All this looks great from the point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of view of a techno-have, but I can scarcely imagine the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anguish of the other half.  My solution is to not be one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them.  Other ideas?  spike
</EM><BR>
