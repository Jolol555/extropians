<P><EM>&gt;Me too.  Calculus, differential equations, and partial differential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;equations were all easy enough to understand conceptually, but they just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;didn't &quot;stick&quot;.  I took almost all of these courses twice as well.

<EM>&gt;Subjects like algebra and trigonometry were so obvious to me it was like

<P>A mathematician friend of mine in college claimed this kind of 
<BR>
experience is very common.  Talented mathematicians feel like it's
<BR>
&quot;already in their brain&quot; until they get to some idiosyncratic
<BR>
point where it isn't and all of a sudden they have to work to 
<BR>
get it.

<P>I have lost most of my mathematical skills with age.  When I was a
<BR>
teenager, everything I ever did was easy, up to real analysis and
<BR>
approximation theory.  Now everything beyond high school is hard
<BR>
(except calculus) and I can't work without reference texts.  Right
<BR>
now I'm working on a (relatively simple) PDE problem and it's very
<BR>
frustrating.  I can remember having the intuition for the
<BR>
manipulations but I don't have it anymore and have to do pages
<BR>
of slow, plodding work with a differential equation book at 
<BR>
hand.
