Subject: Re: SOC/BIO: Rifkin's &quot;worldwide moratorium&quot; on genetically
<BR>
modified  organisms
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Actually, there is no evidence that butterflies are harmed by pesticides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;produced by plants in the field, and evidence to the contrary has been
</EM><BR>
pretty
<BR>
<EM>&gt;overwhelming that the 'sky is falling' whines of the anti-GM greenies is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unfounded in any way.
</EM><BR>
<P>The case I read was about GM crops, not pesticides ...
<BR>
<P>As for 'spores' being 'freed' into the environment, plants do not reproduce
<BR>
by
<BR>
'spores', so any greenies telling you that are obviously ignorant. Since
<BR>
agronomists are aware of the risks, they typically plant a band of crops
<BR>
around
<BR>
test fields that cannot cross pollinate with the test plants. THe pollen
<BR>
only
<BR>
drifts so far before settling to the ground, where it rots.
<BR>
<P>OK, spores, pollen whatever ... I'm not a biologist .... but tell me how you
<BR>
can stop cross-pollination (by wind or insects) by planting a band of crops
<BR>
around a test field? What self-respecting bee or wasp will be put off by
<BR>
this?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just because a technology is new, like GM, does not automatically mean it
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; good. Proper long term testing does not seem to have occurred with GM in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; same way as a new drug testing, although the technology impacts on more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Just because technology is new does not mean you have to fear it like the H
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Bomb.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Proper testing has progressed as far as it can in the laboratories. They
</EM><BR>
must be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;tested in the field, but all attempts at this testing are being sabotaged
</EM><BR>
by the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-GM greenies, which proves that they are not, in fact, interested in
</EM><BR>
'proper
<BR>
<EM>&gt;testing'.
</EM><BR>
<P>If they still have to be tested in the field .... how come so much GM soya
<BR>
is already on the supermarket shelves? What point are you making here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That is merely a straw man for them to present themselves as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'moderate' while they vilify their opponents.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that until science can ensure that neighbouring crops won't become
<BR>
pollinated by GM test crops, the environmentalists have a point.
<BR>
<P>Surely we should err on the side of  caution ...... we just don't know how
<BR>
large-scale GM cultivation will impact on the environment. The dangers of
<BR>
H-bombs &amp;c. is all too apparent, but some new technologies might have more
<BR>
subtle dangers. We are not living in sci-fi fantasy .... if things go wrong
<BR>
in the world they effect real lives.
