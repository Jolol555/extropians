<EM>&gt;         Another good thing about email is that the potential exists to avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being identified as a particular sex.  Many women I've talked to (in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, I believe every woman I've ever talked to about this has had this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience) have reported the following sort ot thing:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         A woman's in a group, say, a business related meeting.  She makes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestion or states an opinion.  Everyone pretty much ignores what she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said--maybe they look at her briefly and say &quot;Uh huh,&quot; but that's about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         A few minutes later one of the male participants makes the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestion or states the same opinion as the woman did earlier.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everyone's very interested,  they all get excited, ask questions, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;         I have a transgendered friend who says that when she was a man she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked on cars quite a bit.  Recently she was riding in a shuttle van
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when the air conditioning compressor began making a loud noise.  The van
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driver pulled over and sat in the sweltering heat until another van could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come and pick everyone up.  No one would pay the slightest attention to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my friend when she tried to tell them it was just the air conditioning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compressor and that if they'd turn off the a/c and open the windows they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could continue to their destination.  She says that in becoming female
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she automatically lost at least 50 IQ points in the eyes of the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ain't that the truth?  Although in my business life I am enough of a
<BR>
techie goddess that I usually (ever so sweetly) make whichever guys
<BR>
ignored me quite sorry when they find that the many of the solutions out
<BR>
of whatever software mess they are in hinge on things I suggested and/or
<BR>
have implemented.  After a while they loose the dismissive attitude. 
<BR>
Lately I've become much better at picking companies that expect large
<BR>
things from me from the get-go and at  comparative large enough
<BR>
compensation that they don't dare simply ignore me.  :-)
<BR>
<P>Even then it can be a challenge.  
<BR>
<P>I understand where your friend is coming from as I myself &quot;made the
<BR>
change&quot; about 10 years ago.  Although I prefer the term transsexual over
<BR>
&quot;transgendered&quot; since the latter is an umbrella term covering a lot more
<BR>
variety of folks than just those of us who seem to have been programmed
<BR>
during fetal development with bodies going one way and minds gendered in
<BR>
the other and actually get around to correcting the situation.  Being TS
<BR>
on top of the stuff women generally go through in business is quite a
<BR>
trip to get used to.  I remember the first design meeting I attended as
<BR>
myself.  I couldn't believe that these were the same bunch of guys I had
<BR>
been working with for 2 years.  Were all those strange ego trips there
<BR>
all along and I didn't notice?  Was it always that hard to get a word in
<BR>
edgewise?  It has taken a over half of those ten years to get back to
<BR>
being fully listened to and being at full power again in my career.  But
<BR>
the price was worth it many times over.
<BR>
<P>So now you know just a bit more about me.  Often, while I have nothing
<BR>
to be ashamed of, I don't mention that part of my history simply because
<BR>
most people haven't much of a clue what that is and is not about. 
<BR>
Images from Jerry Springer or some such nonsense dance through their
<BR>
heads.  Or they think in dozens of stereotypes and think that I must fit
<BR>
in some or most of them.  Which of course I mostly don't.  Or they see
<BR>
it as a &lt;gag me&gt;  &quot;lifestyle choice&quot;.  Increasingly I believe the only
<BR>
way to counteract the lack of understanding and the stereotypes  is for
<BR>
more real people who are TS to simply be open.  So howdy.  Pleased to
<BR>
meet you.
