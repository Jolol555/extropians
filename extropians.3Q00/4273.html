<EM>&gt; Pretty exclusive club, to make an educated professional jump through hoops

<P>While I understand the sentiment, I've often thought that citizenship should not
<BR>
be automajically conferred with birth, but earned through merit (Pournelle's
<BR>
concept of the planet Sparta being such an example), and you could argue that
<BR>
heritable citizenship is technically inconsistent with the Constitution
<BR>
prohibition on inherited titles, your statement forgets the logic that once you
<BR>
are in, you are in for life, and anyone that is out, is out. Of course, some
<BR>
members get by 'on scholarship'.... ;)
<BR>
<P>Kinda like being appointed to the Supreme Court, once you are there, there's not
<BR>
much they can do to you. Notice how Clarence Thomas doesn't give a rats patooty
<BR>
what NAACP, et al think of him (not that he cared much before), but there is
<BR>
nothing they can do to him once he passed the 'high tech lynching' the media put
<BR>
forth. There was a funny skit on SNL several years ago with people playing the
<BR>
various justices, and the new justice, Thomas, acting all Uncle Tom-ish with
<BR>
everyone, getting them coffee, etc. until they tell him that he doesn't have to
<BR>
worry about keeping people happy, that he's in for life. His attitude changes,
<BR>
he kicks back, and when someone asks for more coffee, he says, &quot;Git yo own damn
<BR>
coffee...&quot;
