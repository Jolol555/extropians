<EM>&gt; t what you are advocating is clearly the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; murder the most defenseless members of society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BL:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You're doing the same when you kill a fetus.  Why kid yourself and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pretend that you're not?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Because there is a distinct legal distinction involved. As I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; posted here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before, citizenship is recognised as being conferred at birth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is true, but it's not a satisfying distinction at a time when 3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; month fetuses can be removed from the mother's womb and grown on in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incubator.  And there are other circumstances where it may be desirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to have a clearer definition of human life, or a clearer concept of how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's to be dealt with.   How about when the time comes that a microscopic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; embryo can be grown to term in an artificial womb?
</EM><BR>
<P>When that time comes, its also rather obvious that far more useful, reliable,
<BR>
and care free means of prevening conception in the first place will likely also
<BR>
be available. As I've said before, societies practice the morals they can
<BR>
afford. When society can afford to recognise life beginning at conception, its
<BR>
legal definitions will adjust accordingly, and it will no longer be a point of
<BR>
left/right political contention. When preventing accidental conception is so
<BR>
easy, cheap, and care free, then feminists will lose the moral authority to
<BR>
demand that the woman have the individual authority to command control of her
<BR>
body, because if it is easy to prevent, than anything less is irresponsible
<BR>
action, with no socio-economic excuses remaining.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The unborn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are not citizens, and have no rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Desptie the rhetoric of the &quot;Pro-lifers&quot;, I  think the real issue here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't the rights of the unborn, but rather the rights of the mother.
</EM><BR>
<P>Morally I support pro-lifers. Legally I support pro-choicers. The separation
<BR>
between the two is consistent with the separation of church and state.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And, as ZP pointed out, the rights of the father as well, since the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; father can be forced to support a child once it's born--and once embryos
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be grown to term in artificial wombs, I'd argue that the father has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as much right as the mother to decide the fate of the embryo.  Until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artificial wombs are perfected, I think the decision to HAVE a child must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest with the mother alone; to decide otherwise would be to decide in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; favor of slavery.   That is to say, at this point in time, the decision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether or not to bear a child should be the mother's, but the father
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should have the right to veto a decision in favor of bearing the child.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This raises further questions, such as whether the mother should have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right to override the father's veto if she agrees to waive rights to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paternal support for the child.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've said, I don't mind the woman overriding the father's veto, so long as
<BR>
she releases the father from any financial or other liability for the child. If
<BR>
forcing a woman to give birth to a child is slavery (for 9 months), then forcing
<BR>
a man to support an unwanted child for 18 years is likewise slavery, and for a
<BR>
far longer period.
