<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now, any excess heat a planet radiates above that which it receives from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sun is obviously a result of it turning its angular velocity to heat 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through vulcanism in Venus's case (it doesn't have much angular 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; velocity, having a retrograde day of some 240 earth days) and through 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convection in the case of Neptune. Unless you think there are Helium3 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people living on Neptune fusing hydrogen for energy... 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, the latent heat of planet formation seems to still be
<BR>
the driver for most of the gas giants (esp. Jupiter).  The insulating
<BR>
layer accumulates relatively fast and the gradual gravitational
<BR>
contraction produces heat that only slowly escapes.  There is
<BR>
also a fair amount of radioactive material gradually decaying.
<BR>
<P>I don't think the equations of state are well enough understood
<BR>
to predict how much heat should be produced by these effects
<BR>
and the rates at which they should escape through the overlying
<BR>
material.  For example, we can barely make solid-metallic hydrogen,
<BR>
and can't yet measure such properties as electrical or heat conductivity
<BR>
effectively).  I think the jury is still out on whether Mars does
<BR>
or does not have a liquid core.  And Mars is relatively easy compared
<BR>
with the gas giants.
<BR>
<P>But, I would agree the EvMick's quote of Venus radiating 40x its solar
<BR>
input is higher than anything I've ever seen.  Its albedo is very
<BR>
high, reflecting away much of its incoming light.  The high
<BR>
CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is required to create the
<BR>
very high surface temperatures.  Unless someone is running a
<BR>
large number of nuclear reactors on the surface, the 40x figure
<BR>
is dubious.
