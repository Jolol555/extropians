<P>A pal raised the question off list of whether this gadget's performance is
<BR>
wholly determined by the seed put into a pseudo-randomiser algorithm. I has
<BR>
assumed not, and asked Dr John Haarland for more details. He sent me to the
<BR>
ShapeChanger BB, where I read this:
<BR>
<P>==========
<BR>
<P>&lt; Researchers like those at the PEAR Lab have found that a process needs to
<BR>
be non-deterministically random to be influenced anomalously. We have
<BR>
attempted to achieve this by mixing the use of a pseudo-random number
<BR>
generator, with the position of the computer clock and the status of the
<BR>
Microsoft operating system. Each sample of the random number generator adds
<BR>
or subtracts a pixel, and after each sample a new random number is
<BR>
generated for the next pixel based on the thousands-of-a-second reading of
<BR>
the computer’s clock and the status of the Windows operating system at that
<BR>
moment. Window’s [ Windows' clock? DB] is constantly adjusting to maintain
<BR>
itself, and this, together with the generating of a new random number seed
<BR>
for each pixel sample based on the thousands-of-a-second reading of the
<BR>
computer’s clock, generates sufficient non-deterministic chance outcomes
<BR>
(we believe) to be anomalously influenced. See for your self. There may be
<BR>
certain periods when Windows is not active, which may reduce randomicity
<BR>
somewhat, but the re-selection of a random number each thousands of a
<BR>
second (an unpredictable sampling of the computer clock’s 3rd decimal
<BR>
place) still prevents the full play-out of the pseudo random number
<BR>
process. An essential element of the non-deterministic randomicity is the
<BR>
sloppiness of the Windows operating system. &gt;
<BR>
<P>I don't know if this is sufficiently random to form the basis of a useful
<BR>
experiment, and in any case 
<BR>
Haarland comments (way too blithely for my tastes) that
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;ShapeChanger is a game (not a research tool) intended to whet the users
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;curiosity.  The MicroREG is a physical source random event generator for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;researchers that costs $425 with minimal supporting software.  We have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prototypes, but no consumer versions available yet, of our consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Receiver/Tuner/Converter which we call DRUM. To date our exploratory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;research has confirmed positive results with humans, animals, and  yeast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cultures.  So I am a little bored with computer programmer responses that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do not consider the biophysical properties of living systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A highlight of our US patent claims is shown in the MicroREG section of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Discussion with Lu Rudolph.
