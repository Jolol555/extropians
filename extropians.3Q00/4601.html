<P><EM> &gt; The -pseduo- random number generator you describe is getting very close to

<EM> &gt; being effectively a random number generator, at least until repetetion

<EM> &gt; occurs.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
Indeed, that's why the only difference is &quot;pseudo&quot;. The pseudo ones
<BR>
eventually cycle, the real ones (if they do indeed exist, some
<BR>
physicists seem to doubt that) don't. In cryptography there is an
<BR>
attack on generation of secrets based on knowledge of your
<BR>
pseudorandom number generator algorithm and it's state. Hence real
<BR>
cryptographic suites always draw on an entropy pool based on digitized
<BR>
real-world noise. In absence of a hardware random number generator,
<BR>
this relies on user key strokes and mouse movements, hard drive seek
<BR>
times, LSB of audio and video inputs and is a scarce resource. (In
<BR>
fact, there's even a DoS on the entropy pool -- in Linux by reading a
<BR>
lot of bytes from /dev/random). Hardware random generators have begun
<BR>
to crop up in motherboard chipsets, but since they're not fully
<BR>
documented the cryptographic community does not trust them.

<EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; One could assign a probability of being truly random to such a string of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; numbers.  (Which is all one could do in any case.)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; -Any- string of numbers (source independent) has a probability of being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; truly random-- the closer that probabilty is to 100%, the more effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; random that string becomes.  Though excruciating unlikely (actually a limit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that approaches zero) a string of 1s -could- be the output of a truly random
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; generator.
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course all tests for randomness are statistical. Probabilistic
<BR>
proofs only become asymptotically absolute in infinite time. In
<BR>
practice you will it extremely tedious to wait for a cryptohash fed
<BR>
with it's own output to begin to cycle.
