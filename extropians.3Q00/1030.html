In forecasting the future, it is useful to study the past and

the present.

<BR>
<P>&quot;...With Jean-Claude Van Damme as Henry Blodgett. . . I received an absolutely 
<BR>
jaw-dropping e-mail from a friend of mine who happens to be
<BR>
one of the live fish [meaning an honest analyst in Fleck's lingo]
<BR>
on Wall Street. I've quoted him in the past but, as always, I need 
<BR>
to keep him anonymous because he couldn't tell me what's really 
<BR>
going on if I included his name. 
<BR>
He sent me an e-mail regarding Salomon Smith Barney's recent 
<BR>
downgrade of four semiconductor stocks, which he titled, 
<BR>
&quot;Bloodsport.&quot; [Note: He doesn't work at Salomon.] It follows: 
<BR>
<P>Subject: Re: SSB semi call 
<BR>
<P>Bill, 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;You might be interested to learn that they 
<BR>
received seven death threats and body guards have been hired. 
<BR>
Confirmed factual.
<BR>
<P>The analysts have been told to take a break from coming into the office. 
<BR>
<P>Investing in the U.S. has become a bit like an international soccer 
<BR>
match. Not only are sides taken based on team affiliation
<BR>
(long/short, bull/bear), but players and spectators can be subject 
<BR>
to uncivilized behavior, including violence.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;So, that's what this environment has come to. We've talked about 
<BR>
the fact that spin and charts are all that matters, and that 
<BR>
bubblevision [CNBC] whips the troops into a frenzy. Now folks that 
<BR>
actually make a stab at pointing out things that might be flaws 
<BR>
in the bullish spin have to worry for their lives. And folks 
<BR>
really believe all this is healthy? &quot;

Somebody Turn on the Lights 
<BR>
<P>Derivatives Strategy, November, 1999 
<BR>
By Martin Mayer, Guest Scholar, Economic Studies Program 
<BR>
<P>&quot;...The literature has failed to consider the extent to which 
<BR>
market practitioners, with their great weight of money, influence 
<BR>
both regulatory decisions and academic theory. 
<BR>
<P>[It is refreshing to see this most crucial issue aired. Paid economists in 
<BR>
the US are rewarded for embelishing the epicycles of monetarism, similar
<BR>
to their career paths in the old Soviet Union.]
<BR>
<P>Since the mid-1990s, the Basle committees have approved
<BR>
the use of internal value-at-risk analysis as the determinant of the amount of
<BR>
capital banks must hold to cover derivatives activities. This abdication of
<BR>
supervisory function followed JP Morgan’s publication of its RiskMetrics
<BR>
methodology, which supposedly enabled banks to measure the extent of their
<BR>
risks looking forward into the realm where uncertainty -- not probability --
<BR>
reigns. In 1998 and 1999, the pressure from banks was to permit the use of
<BR>
Morgan’s CreditMetrics as a forecaster of the credit risk in a portfolio. The
<BR>
expertise of the banking industry is presumably in information-intensive
<BR>
lending, but CreditMetrics rests on published ratings of corporations and
<BR>
countries by Moody’s, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Fitch/ICBA. It is not an
<BR>
accident, as ideologists like to say, that these operations proceed from
<BR>
Morgan....&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;...Derivatives markets guarantee a winner for every loser, but they will over
<BR>
time
<BR>
concentrate the losses in vulnerable sectors. Nature obeys Mayer’s Third
<BR>
Law, which holds that risk-shifting instruments will tend to shift risks onto
<BR>
those less able to bear them, because them as got want to keep and hedge
<BR>
while them as ain’t got want to get and speculate. The logic behind margin
<BR>
requirements in stock markets and capital requirements in banking also holds
<BR>
in the derivatives markets. Permitting highly leveraged institutions to hold
<BR>
private parties behind closed doors is the political version of selling
<BR>
volatility:
<BR>
the predictable likely gains will one day be overwhelmed by an equally
<BR>
predictable disastrous loss.&quot;
<BR>
<P>[The OTC derivatives market is an unknowable contributor to the current era of
<BR>
rolling currency collapses. Notional values are somewhere above $100 trillion.
<BR>
US OTC (principly interest swaps, some exotics) bank exposures appear to 
<BR>
average several times assets.]

FRAUD: ANOTHER SIGN OF A MANIA IN ITS TERMINAL
<BR>
PHASE
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;11 July 2000
<BR>
<P>&quot;The histories of market manias and their ensuing panics all tell a similar
<BR>
story: manias give rise to frauds, manipulations and swindles and their
<BR>
unwinding contributes to the bursting of the bubble... &quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;...But, as we have seen with Russia, if the
<BR>
ethical basis of free markets degenerates sufficiently, all that we have left
<BR>
is a form of kleptocracy.  A pattern of such ethical disintegration, as
<BR>
evidenced by the Canadian stock manipulation scandal, or the widespread
<BR>
abuse of accounting principles, usually emerges at the peak of manias
<BR>
where greed predominates and fraud becomes pervasive.  Just from the
<BR>
numerous examples out there in the public domain today, we appear to be
<BR>
at that juncture today.  And the outcome may prove to be just as grave,
<BR>
but far more widespread, ... &quot;
