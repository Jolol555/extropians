<BR>
got me thinking...what if part of how AI can get implemented, is as a
<BR>
series of generators of things that most businesses treat as
<BR>
intellectural property?  For example, music: this is but one of the
<BR>
music generators out there, which basically take centuries-old (or
<BR>
sometimes much more recent) rules that music students learn, refined
<BR>
over time into an algorithm, and translate into code.  And yet it is
<BR>
just an extension of these rules, to levels which have not yet been as
<BR>
refined, that masters of music (big name bands) follow in generating
<BR>
their art; it seems possible that a neural net, building on a
<BR>
semi-flexible, semi-rigid (semi-crystal?) foundation of the basic rules,
<BR>
could listen to these masters over and over until it was able to
<BR>
generate entirely new tunes which no one (except maybe the band itself)
<BR>
could not tell from the music makers' actual work.
<BR>
<P>I know that research similar to this has gone on under the title of
<BR>
&quot;expert systems&quot; - but those are usually expensive and proprietary
<BR>
systems.  What if, for fields which people without much cash dabble in,
<BR>
there were a system for a novice to translate the rules he/she learned
<BR>
into code, then share that code with other hobbyist friends (a few of
<BR>
which might have some insights into a rarely-used rule, which said
<BR>
friend could add as a code patch)?
<BR>
<P>I don't just mean standard &quot;open source&quot; here, though that is a large
<BR>
part of it.  I also mean an easier way to translate human knowledge to
<BR>
algorithm to code, plus a standard interface for a neural net to plug
<BR>
into, to brute-force innovation, once the humans generating the base had
<BR>
exhausted the easy, and possibly even the moderately difficult, wins.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I'm just rambling here...but this seems like a way people could
<BR>
automate almost any craft that has been done by anyone for several
<BR>
years, since a necessary part of building experience is forming an
<BR>
internal model of the domain.  Get a good translation of said domain
<BR>
into code, and...
