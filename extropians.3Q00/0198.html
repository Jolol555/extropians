Ron S. wrote in Cryonet:
<BR>
In President Clinton's press Conference last Thursday he said:
<BR>
&quot;..we've treated the human genome project like a priority every year because 
<BR>
we all want to live for ever. And that's good, I'm not minimizing that - we 
<BR>
do . &quot;
<BR>
<P>I find this a particularly enlightened statement , and possibly the first 
<BR>
public recognition of the possibility of immortality by a  politician in 
<BR>
high office. Perhaps Clinton is a potential  candidate for cryonics, the 
<BR>
powerful support weave been looking for.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It is an interesting insight into the mind of the president.  I bet secretly 
<BR>
a large number of politicians think this way.  Perhaps Clinton would be a 
<BR>
potential candidate for cryonics.  Especially when vitrification technology 
<BR>
has been perfected and cryonics is not such a crap shoot.
<BR>
<P>He could be an example to the boomers who would give it some serious thought 
<BR>
if Clinton signed up.  Considering Clinton's female following, we might end 
<BR>
up with many more women signed up.
<BR>
<P>I just wonder how he could be discretely contacted.  Than again, he just 
<BR>
might find us.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
