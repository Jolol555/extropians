<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Anders you always have such interesting responses. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks! :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yet, looking back in history on what was considered beautiful, I wonder how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much of our infatuation with the &quot;average&quot; is a product of just plain *Being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bombarded* with &quot;perfect&quot; blonde-blue eyed face after face after face, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;perfect&quot; size body after body after body?  With relentless purpose, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fashion industry has induced in us an ever younger, creaseless, more bland 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfection. Mae West could not get photographed to save her life these days, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and we rarely see a &quot;buff&quot; female -except on fitness mags
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - though both of those body types is nearer to perfection (IMO) than the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current fad for same-same guys and girlies we see in the catalogues.
</EM><BR>
<P>The waist/hip ratio might be one of those things that we tend to seek
<BR>
supernormal signals for, while the face seems to be one we seek the
<BR>
pefect average. I think those average studies showed that the face
<BR>
properties were generally quite culture-invariant, and I'm ready to
<BR>
bet that the body aspect is much more cultural. Madison Avenue might
<BR>
be able to affect how thin we should be, but I wonder if they would
<BR>
ever be able to make us enjoy asymmetrical faces? 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me what the meme is all about these days is getting a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; body that has *no characteristics that are personalized*. Photoshop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has made this possible. The airbrush courteously removes all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; puckers, armpits, zits, compression marks, moles, body hair or any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; markings of individuality that the body may hold. Madison Avenue's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; erection is not for More Than Average, it is for &quot;empty&quot; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience. This hothouse version of humanity has survived nothing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been traumatized in no way, has no injury.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find it mildly disturbing ...and compelling at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the same we see an increase in people daring to personalise their
<BR>
bodies through tattos, piercings and various alteration of
<BR>
clothing. Could it be that many simply do not want to become
<BR>
standardised and move in other directions? Instead of using the old
<BR>
individuality markings (many of which represents minor imperfections
<BR>
of the &quot;ideal&quot; working of the body) they instead create their own
<BR>
completely individual markings which are only based on their own
<BR>
wishes, not random nature? That would seem to be a rather
<BR>
transhumanist move.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As well: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the name of attractiveness, babies feet were bound, women's teeth 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blackened, labrets worn through the lips and heads flattened by various 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who had an idea that this was TRULY beautiful! So we are always 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vulnerable to meme-takeovers... not always rational ones, though we can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rationalize them. What makes us think the current scientific rationale for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bland features is the more valid? ; - )
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, the current supermodels (or rather, last decade's supermodels)
<BR>
represent just one bodily form of many that can be appreciated by
<BR>
culture. What is interesting is the interplay between what people find
<BR>
attractive, culture in general and the groups that feed it back to
<BR>
people (in our case advertisers and other media).  Usually people talk
<BR>
about it as if there was just a one-way signal from the media to
<BR>
people, determining what they think is beautiful, but in reality there
<BR>
is also the intense feedback in the other direction. The advertisments
<BR>
people like will will be effective, making the advertising people more
<BR>
likely to use such appearances in the next one. Hmm, this is *exactly*
<BR>
like many models of sexual selection of appearance in animals, only
<BR>
this time it is selection of beauty concepts. In animals this seem to
<BR>
lead to extreme, unusual and very varied appearances from species to
<BR>
species (but less variation within species), in us humans it seems to
<BR>
lead to - exactly the same thing.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; You ask what kind of reengineering can we do to our libidos? Better ask - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what can we do to improve our meme immune system all around!
</EM><BR>
<P>Definitely one of the top elements on any transhumanist to-become
<BR>
list. I like to train my critical thinking by reading widely, seeing
<BR>
how differently people view the world and trying to look into how well
<BR>
their views fit with known reality.
