<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure that David's transparency would necessarily fix the IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problem, anyway.  In a truly transparent world, shouldn't I be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; look over David's shoulder as he types up his latest novel?  Shouldn't I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have access to it in the files on his computer?  And if I buy the book,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shouldn't my friends be able to read it at the same time that I do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; via my wearable webcam?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think that kind of total transparency is likely. People won't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voluntarily allow cameras into their homes that they can't turn off, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow everyone to access their hard drives across the Internet. I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really imagine that the technology necessary to achieve total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transparency without consent will arrive soon enough to make a difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the IP issue. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You're probably right about the relative time frames.  These IP issues
<BR>
have come to the fore more abruptly than most people anticipated a few
<BR>
years ago.
<BR>
<P>My understanding of Brin's ideas was that transparency would in fact
<BR>
invade the home.  He did suggest that there might be specific areas where
<BR>
people would still have privacy, but he wanted to be able to make sure
<BR>
they were not commiting information crimes.  This was also the motivation
<BR>
to crack down on crypto.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; David Brin himself claims that he is interested in transparency as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protection against abuse by the powerful. I don't think it's the right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution to that problem, but it seems like a more plausible motivation.
</EM><BR>
<P>It was my interpretation, based on some email correspondence and reading
<BR>
an early draft of his book.  He mentioned concern about his own livelihood
<BR>
in the draft; I don't recall whether it made it into the final version.
<BR>
Crypto doesn't seem to be a tool for the powerful, but he spends a lot
<BR>
of time arguing against it.  And as you say, there is a poor fit between
<BR>
the ostensible problem and the proposed solution, which suggests to me
<BR>
an ulterior motive.
