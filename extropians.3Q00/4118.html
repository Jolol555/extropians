<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Corporations are a matter of people getting together cooperatively to

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the process, from the formation of the corporation, to the job offer,

<EM>&gt;James Wetterau points out,

<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, corporations receive limitations on their liability.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, of course this is right, I was ignoring this aspect in my brief
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;description because the original concern seemed to relate to other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aspects of corporations than liability limitation.  Their size, their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political influence, their heirarchical structure and ability to fire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people at will, all were named as threats, and it was to this that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanted to respond.

<P>And on that note, consider how the Unemployment Compensation or Workman's 
<BR>
Comp systems actually work in practice.  Unemployment compensation requires 
<BR>
the worker to prove that he or she was fired or laid-off due to no fault of 
<BR>
their own.  The worker is forced to pay into the system, and then it 
<BR>
requires him to put up with virtually anything on the job with no recourse.  
<BR>
If he quits because the boss is a sadistic jerk who spends every day 
<BR>
psychologically torturing him, he gets back none of the money he paid in.  
<BR>
And stress only counts in Workman's Comp if it can be proven to be sudden 
<BR>
and out of the ordinary.  If you get high blood pressure due to months or 
<BR>
years of being bullied or insulted, then that's your problem.
<BR>
<P>At the Teamster Union warehouse where I worked for five years in the late 
<BR>
'70's, the company simply ignored any and all safety regulations, on the 
<BR>
theory that it was cheaper just to pay the arbitrarilly capped workman's 
<BR>
comp settlements.  They also ignored any and all health regs regarding the 
<BR>
&quot;health foods&quot; which they supplied to most of the health food stores on the 
<BR>
West Coast, on the theory that they didn't have to do anything until the 
<BR>
Health Inspectors actually ordered them to.  If you were buying vitamins in 
<BR>
the late '70's thru mid '80's, you almost certainly bought some from their 
<BR>
hot, filthy, rat-infested warehouse.
<BR>
<P>These systems were built out of joint political agreements, BTW, between our 
<BR>
wonderful &quot;progressive&quot; union reps, politicians who needed money, and 
<BR>
industry lobbiests, all of whom have strong vested interests in keeping the 
<BR>
workers under their thumb.  (Just try getting help from your local union on 
<BR>
any job issue if you're on the losing team in the last union elections.  
<BR>
I've been there.)
<BR>
<P>These are just a couple of little examples of the twisted structure that has 
<BR>
evolved in the name of protecting the worker or the consumer, but which 
<BR>
invariably serves concentrations of power instead, all consequent to the 
<BR>
machinations of our wonderful &quot;progressive&quot; friends.
