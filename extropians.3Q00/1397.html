<EM>&gt; What good is an extra 3 IQ points when you have less than half of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available time to use it?  I would say they're worthless.  I would further add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that having 20 extra IQ points, while being deeply depressed and immobilized,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is almost completely worthless.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is this &quot;you&quot; you're talking about?  Does it have a referent
<BR>
distinct from &quot;IQ points&quot;?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; After all what exactly are we referring to as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence - raw logical reasoning abilities and nothing more?
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  We're talking about wisdom and self-awareness.  (Not that quote raw
<BR>
logical reasoning abilities unquote wouldn't be reason enough to stay
<BR>
off Prozac.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What good is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it if you don't have the emotional strength to utilize it in any meaningful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way?  I know a few people who are extremely intelligent and have spent the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of their adult lives laying on their beds depressed with absolutely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no ambition to do anything.  What have they accomplished?
</EM><BR>
<P>I should think I have accomplished a great deal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals finally started taking an extract of St John's Wort and is now up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and about, holding a steady job and actually beginning to enjoy his life.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the first time, he is actually contemplating moving out of the city in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he has lived for over 20 years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe he had a curable problem that was solved with no drawbacks.  Or
<BR>
maybe he sacrificed everything that made him unique so he could be
<BR>
happy.  I can't tell from the information provided.
