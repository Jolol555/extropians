<P>
I was really struck by a couple of passages in the socialist tract re-posted
<BR>
from /. which I reproduce below:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;Socialism has been discredited as a workable political philosophy, and is
</EM><BR>
considered by some to be no longer fashionable.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Yes, it has been discredited based on what it has produced, and fashion has
<BR>
nothing to do with it. So why does anyone keep pushing this discredited
<BR>
theory?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&quot;In the past, we have allowed self-interested, opportunistic politicians to
</EM><BR>
trick us into thinking that they were interested in the public at large.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Right! And not only in the past. The plain fact is that governments are
<BR>
always run primarily for the benefit those who run governments. Just look at
<BR>
how well government leaders and their sycophants live in even the poorest
<BR>
socialist state. Look at Mao and Stalin and Kim Jong Il and Castro. If, as
<BR>
the writer of the above claimed, we are all equal, then he must admit that,
<BR>
as Orwell wrote in &quot;Animal Farm&quot; some are &quot;more equal than others.&quot; Slavery
<BR>
and indentured servitude were abolished in capitalist societies long ago.
<BR>
But in communist (&quot;hard socialist&quot;) states, where forced labor by political
<BR>
dissidents is still a significant economic factor, slavery is alive and
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P>Socialism is nothing but a smoke and mirrors propaganda (or advertising)
<BR>
campaign designed to fool a majority into empowering a minority; a minority
<BR>
that cannot deliver on its promises, but can eliminate the hope for real
<BR>
economic progress.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Michael LaTorra
