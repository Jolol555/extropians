&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;... their views rest very much on studies in 
<BR>
comparative history, particularly of monetary systems 
<BR>
in different places at different times. Their struggle 
<BR>
in its broadest sense is for freedom -- a worldwide 
<BR>
economic freedom that is not possible without an 
<BR>
international monetary system based on a permanent and 
<BR>
shared standard of value. 
<BR>
<P>Gold bugs [sound money advocates] cannot be truly 
<BR>
understood apart from the 
<BR>
fundamental values to which they are committed: 
<BR>
personal integrity and honest dealing. Today they are 
<BR>
vastly outnumbered by public and private forces with 
<BR>
far more resources and huge stakes in continuing the 
<BR>
system of unlimited fiat money [printing-press currency]
<BR>
-- impermissible under 
<BR>
the Constitution of the United States -- that they have 
<BR>
erected largely for their own benefit. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Tyranny spawns resistance, and the tyranny of the paper 
<BR>
dollar 
<BR>
<P>[My term: &quot;sustainable plunder&quot;- the resultant of Bretton
<BR>
Woods masquerading as the &quot;Keyensian Boom&quot;.]
<BR>
<P>is no exception. Organizations favoring some 
<BR>
sort of return to sound money based on gold or silver 
<BR>
exist all over the globe. 
<BR>
<P>Working to restore gold to its rightful place both at 
<BR>
the center of the international payments system and in 
<BR>
the American constitutional order, gold bugs are 
<BR>
soldiers for economic freedom, which in the end is an 
<BR>
essential component of political freedom too. They keep 
<BR>
alive concepts, ideas, and values that have fallen out 
<BR>
of fashion, that are no longer taught in schools and 
<BR>
colleges, but that nevertheless embody the wisdom of 
<BR>
the ages. 
<BR>
<P>Without the gold bugs, the collapse of today's 
<BR>
worldwide system of unlimited fiat money is likely to 
<BR>
lead to dark times indeed. With them, if they do their 
<BR>
job well now, the collapse can instead be turned into a 
<BR>
springboard from which to restore principles of sound 
<BR>
money and public integrity long absent from the world 
<BR>
and national stages. 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&quot;All paper will burn.&quot;
