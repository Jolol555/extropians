</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So if society conducts itself according to *your* belief that a 3 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; month old 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fetus is mere biological rubbish 
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Society&quot; shouldn't be making such choices in the first place.  It's the
<BR>
individual WOMAN who has to use up her energy, her time, her spirit
<BR>
growing the embryo into a baby.  Until such time as it becomes feasible
<BR>
to routinely grow embryos in artificial wombs--and even then there's some
<BR>
question in my mind as to whether &quot;society&quot; should have the right to
<BR>
harvest a fertile egg from a woman's body and grow it into a baby--the
<BR>
choice should be solely up to the woman. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I know I'm treading on VERY thin ice with the following statement, but
<BR>
I'd argue in favor of a woman's right to dispose of a newly born baby. 
<BR>
Please know that I say this as a mother who fiercly protected her own
<BR>
fetus from the abortionist's suction device and who would have given her
<BR>
life to save the life of her child--and still would.  But I've also SEEN
<BR>
what it's like to be living on the edge and to be forced to bear and care
<BR>
for a baby.  Believe me, from the baby's point of view, death would be
<BR>
far preferable to that which such children are often forced to endure.
<BR>
