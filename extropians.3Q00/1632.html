<P>
Michael S. Lorrey&quot; added his attack to the prior attack I grumbled about:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I've been on the list for years, and I've NEVER heard of any such thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Either you made it up or you deliberately misunderstood someones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recommendation that you just listen for a while to get into the flow of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's the July 10th message I was referring to.  Are you saying it's not an attack?
<BR>
<P>&quot;Well, hello troll, I haven't seen you around here before... do you have
<BR>
anything substantive to say, or are you just a hit &amp; run luddite?&quot;
<BR>
<P>According to my files, I had posted twice prior to the attack so I really do feel like
<BR>
the author was trying to Catch-22 me (&quot;don't post here until you've been seen posting
<BR>
for a while&quot;).  I don't know if he is the moderator or not.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; There is no *impossible*, only difficult, expensive, or time consuming.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously, we have different opinions. Not everything can be stuffed back in Pandora's
<BR>
Box.  BTW, I'm here at ground-zero (i.e, farming the soil).  How many miles back are
<BR>
you?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tree huggers like you think something is *impossible* if the solution
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that a name?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does not satisfy your &quot;I want it now&quot; spoiled brat baby boomer
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that another name?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attitudes. Nature does heal. Its very good at it (just look at the Mt.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; St. Helens 'Dead Zone' for proof).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting that you would bring that up.  Really good farmers, as opposed to the
<BR>
&quot;spread bagged stuff and poison the sh*t out of anything that moves&quot; variety knew
<BR>
beforehand that Mt. St. Helens would go a long way toward remineralizing thousands of
<BR>
square miles of needy land.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The anti-GMO side is ignorant to the extreme (hell, they can't even
</EM><BR>
<P>It that a name?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pronounce 'nuclear' right), their whole argument is based on ignorance,
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that another name---or two?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and a willful ignorance at that. Their science is pseudo-science of the
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that two more?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worst sort, that any real scientist would laugh at as the product of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sixth grade student, with logical errors abounding and much unaccounted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for evidence.
</EM><BR>
<P>Two more---what is the name count up to?
<BR>
<P>I generally fire up the killfile when the name-calling count hits ten.  Besides, I was
<BR>
only trying to offer another opinion and don't always have time for battles.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
Rex Harrill
