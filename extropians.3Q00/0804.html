<EM>&gt; Exactly. There is much good stuff in psychology, but the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conception is right in that there are indeed some rather silly or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unscientific parts too. I have found many parts of psychotherapy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have an epistemology that leaves much to be desired.

Yes, as have I. Why do you think that is the case, Anders? I've seen
<BR>
some of the other postings on this thread and correctness aside, it is
<BR>
interesting that psychotherapy seems to be a &quot;victim&quot; of its own
<BR>
success. A lot of it is unfounded (Note: That doesn't mean it won't
<BR>
work.), but the practice of psychological therapy in general seems to
<BR>
attract quite a number of paying customers, even though most people I've
<BR>
met chuckle and dismiss it all as the rantings of a coked-up, sexually
<BR>
deviant mad man.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps as a defense reaction (the classic Freudian answer/evasion)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
I might lump it into some type of cognitive dissonance. =) &quot;I think all
<BR>
therapy is bunk and untenable. So, why do I go? There must be something
<BR>
there that works!&quot; Hmmm...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm myself interested in cognitive therapy, although due to my normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research I heavily lean towards the biological &quot;everything is some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neurotransmittor's fault&quot;-perspective :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Heh. Sure is. Well, mostly. It seems intuitively possible that it may
<BR>
not be the fault of individual neurons per se, but further upstream in
<BR>
the transport of fuel (oxygen and sugars) from the blood into the brain.
<BR>
I think the brain is complex enough that while gross loss of fuel
<BR>
results in gross behavior (e.g., fainting, etc.), mild fluctuations can
<BR>
significantly influence behaviors much more subtly. Of course, the same
<BR>
argument can apply to even further upstream and out into the
<BR>
environment. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;If the photons from that romantic comedy hadn't entered my retina, I
<BR>
wouldn't be crying right now!&quot; And again, of course, I didn't think you
<BR>
were implying that the environment has no effect on our cognition.
