<P>Gisin, Scarani, Tittel and Zbinden
<BR>
in this *very beautiful* article say that....
<BR>
<P>The story of quantum nonlocality is fascinating. We
<BR>
could take advantage of this to promote Physics! We
<BR>
already learned a lot from it, in particular about the
<BR>
weirdness and importance of entanglement in the quantum
<BR>
world. We are also learning how important entanglement
<BR>
can be for our technology, namely that we could
<BR>
exploit entanglement to perform tasks classically
<BR>
impossible, like quantum cryptography and many others.
<BR>
This field is nowaday well recognized under the general name
<BR>
of quantum information processing. But the story
<BR>
is not at the end. Using new technologies, revolutionary
<BR>
assumptions can be tested. Admittedly, some of the
<BR>
assumptions discussed in this contribution are wild. But
<BR>
they are testable with today's technology and they
<BR>
provide great intellectual excitement. Moreover, they are
<BR>
very natural in the context of the debate about the
<BR>
existence or non-existence of state-vector collapses,
<BR>
a question which triggered animated discussions and disputes
<BR>
since the very early times of quantum mechanics, 100
<BR>
years ago. It is worth realizing that there are not that
<BR>
many alternatives to the existence of &quot;real collapses&quot;:
<BR>
without collapses the logical implication of the
<BR>
superposition principle is that all possibilities co-exist,
<BR>
in the form of some multiverse. But this huge superposition
<BR>
can't be tested directly. Isn't it nice to argue
<BR>
in favor or against the concept of collapse as a physical
<BR>
phenomena by designing and performing experiments of the kind
<BR>
discussed in this contribution!
