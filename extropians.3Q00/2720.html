Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>I wish to tell you about a very worthwhile organization which deserves 
<BR>
donations from extropian list members.  It is the Institute for Neural 
<BR>
Cryobiology.  The research program for it is called the Cryopreservation of 
<BR>
Hippocampal Slices Project.  The goal is perfected vitrification of the 
<BR>
brain.
<BR>
<P>I now share with you a list of the leadership who are trying to push the 
<BR>
work forward.
<BR>
<P>The founder and chairman of the board is Thomas Donaldson, Ph.D. - Founder 
<BR>
and Chairman of the Board Thomas Donaldson has a PhD in mathematics and has 
<BR>
published one technical book and several long papers on partial differential 
<BR>
equations and related techniques. He has published many articles of 
<BR>
speculative science in the popular magazine Analog Science Fiction and Fact. 
<BR>
One of these, 24th Century Medicine, has been reprinted and anthologized. He 
<BR>
has also written a reference book for anyone seriously interested in using 
<BR>
some of the drugs known to increase lifespan in animals -  A Guide To 
<BR>
Antiaging Drugs.
<BR>
<P>Thomas Donaldson has been reading and teaching himself about cryobiology and 
<BR>
neuroscience, since the early 1970's. Since 1991 he has been publisher and 
<BR>
editor of Periastron, his own newsletter about cryobiology, neuroscience, 
<BR>
memory, consciousness and identity.
<BR>
<P>He can be reached at

<P>Peter Gouras, M. D.  - Director
<BR>
Peter Gouras is an ophthalmologist and vision research scientist. He 
<BR>
received his education in New York City, obtaining his MD from Johns Hopkins 
<BR>
University in 1955, and surgery internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 
<BR>
1955-56.
<BR>
Dr. Gouras has held fellow, research, instructor, and/or leadership 
<BR>
positions at:
<BR>
<P>National Institute of Neurological Diseases &amp; Blindness, National Institute 
<BR>
of Health

<BR>
<P>Paul Wakfer - Director and President
<BR>
Paul Wakfer is a 62 year old Canadian whose home is in Toronto, but who has 
<BR>
spent much time in Southern California. Paul is family oriented, treasures 
<BR>
the innocence and wonder of bright young minds, and enjoys spending time 
<BR>
with his grandchildren. Since childhood Paul has believed that the 
<BR>
degeneration of aging was to be fought, prevented and overcome, especially 
<BR>
in regard to age related mental diseases and decline. While working to 
<BR>
promote this, he practices a healthy and mentally enhancing lifestyle to the 
<BR>
extent that this is determinable from current knowledge. This includes a 
<BR>
calorie restricted diet, extensive use of nutritional supplements, and 
<BR>
significant mental and physical exercise.
<BR>
Paul is an honors graduate of the University of Toronto in Engineering 
<BR>
Physics (BASc - 1959) and received a master's degree in Applied Mathematics 
<BR>
(1960). In 1959, he won the Canadian Association of Physicist's prize in a 
<BR>
nationwide competition of undergraduate physics students.
<BR>
<P>Paul has held the following positions:
<BR>
<P>Research Assistant &amp; Graduate Student, Courant Institute of Mathematical 
<BR>
Sciences, New York Univ (1960-1962)
<BR>
RCAF Flight Lieutenant and Mathematics Instructor, College Militaire Royale, 
<BR>

<BR>
President, Cryovita Laboratories, Inc. (1992-1996)
<BR>
Cofounder and Executive Director, 21st Century Medicine (1993-1994)
<BR>
Paul has been a self-employed computer consultant for over 20 years. In 
<BR>
Toronto, from 1983 to 1991, he started and operated a very successful full 
<BR>
service computer business.
<BR>
<P>Paul has always maintained a burning interest in all the sciences and in 
<BR>
bettering the human condition by rational means. After selling his business 
<BR>
in 1991, Paul became a frequent visitor to the US in order to further this 
<BR>
interest. Since then he has been very active in the life extension movement 
<BR>
and instrumental in funding and encouraging life extension research, as 
<BR>
president of Cryovita Laboratories, as a founder of 21st Century Medicine, 
<BR>
and now, as President of The Institute for Neural Cryobiology. Paul is also 
<BR>
a member of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine.

<P>So now you know the caliber of people involved in this organization.  To 
<BR>
learn more go to their website at <A HREF="http://www.neurocryo.org/">http://www.neurocryo.org/</A> and investigate 
<BR>
for yourself.
<BR>
<P>Donations of equipment, property or any assets are acceptable. All cash 
<BR>
donations show be made payable and sent to:
<BR>
<P>The Institute for Neural Cryobiology
<BR>
1606 E Washington St #308, Colton, CA 92324
<BR>
<P><P>I have donated twenty dollars to the organization myself.  Not very much, 
<BR>
but at least it is something.  Considering my income it is actually a 
<BR>
generous donation.  I would ask all of you to please seriously consider a 
<BR>
financial donation.
<BR>
<P>This organization desperately needs funding to keep going and Ben Best has 
<BR>
donated ten thousand himself; though he is not by any means a rich man.  Dr. 
<BR>
Greg Fahy is a strong believer in the project and for those of you who know 
<BR>
of his reputation that should say something.  Please, just donate what you 
<BR>
can.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
