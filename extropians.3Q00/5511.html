<EM>&gt; Frankly I have had enough friends raped, mugged and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had a second level friend beaten to death. Like most of us I tend not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dwell on these things too much.  But I can't help but wonder if one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friend would still be alive and if the others would have been a lot less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traumatized if they were armed.  The issues aren't all academic or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter of 2nd amendment justifying of not justifying it.  These things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are also a matter of life and death of real people, some of them quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; close to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>To carry a lethal weapon, as others have pointed out, means adjusting
<BR>
your thought processes to the point where you are prepared to exercise
<BR>
lethal force.  You have to be ready to kill, if you carry a gun.
<BR>
<P>And for it to be useful in the examples cited, you have to be ready to
<BR>
kill in response to an assault of less than lethal magnitude.  You need
<BR>
to be ready to kill in response to robbery, for example.
<BR>
<P>I don't think most people are ready to kill.  I don't think they are
<BR>
prepared to personally take a human life.  From what I've read, for most
<BR>
people (not all) this is a tremendously traumatic experience.  To kill
<BR>
a human being carries the ultimate degree of finality.  You take away
<BR>
everything he will ever have and will ever be.  There is no chance of
<BR>
reconciliation, no chance of recovery, no chance of reparing the damage
<BR>
which has been done and beginning to start anew.  It's over, permanently
<BR>
and forever.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that preparing yourself psychologically for this action
<BR>
requires a certain amount of distancing and depersonalizing your
<BR>
attitudes towards other people.  You can't think of your target as a
<BR>
human being with hopes and aspirations, struggling under the weight of
<BR>
damaging experiences and harmful thoughts.  He needs to be thought of
<BR>
impersonally, as a threat to be eliminated.
<BR>
<P>In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment will
<BR>
be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
<BR>
potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
<BR>
impersonal and hard-hearted?  Might they not face a burden in setting up
<BR>
alliances and working together with other people, compared to those who
<BR>
are more trusting, open and accepting of human limitations and weaknesses?
<BR>
<P>Taking the responsibility of carrying a gun is going to change you.
<BR>
It forces you to think of yourself as a killer, as one who is willing
<BR>
to kill.  Admittedly, if you actually save your life by carrying the
<BR>
gun then any costs it imposes are worthwhile.  But the chance that you
<BR>
will actually be killed by violence are highly remote.
<BR>
<P>Given the very small probability of this outcome, the costs in terms
<BR>
of your alienation from society must be considered significant.  In the
<BR>
long run your survival prospects will be hurt by having a lesser degree
<BR>
of social connectivity.
