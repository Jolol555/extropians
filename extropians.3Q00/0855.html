<P><EM>&gt; Who knows, it might end in the glorious anarchic revolution, where

<EM>&gt;  everything is free and the world is beautiful.

</EM><BR>
<P>..heheh... do I detect a bit of sarcasm here &lt;; - ) ?
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks everyone for your comments so far. I am not entirely sure of my 
<BR>
position on 
<BR>
Napster, mostly I think it's kinda dumb and harmless, but I won't OK my 
<BR>
boyfriend smuggle in tape recorders to make bootlegs, since I think it's 
<BR>
unethical. I'll write a little so you can see why this bothers me in some 
<BR>
way. 
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>One, as an artist and musician, I do not want my art to be gloriously free... 
<BR>
pay me please, it you like it enough to take it home with you.
<BR>
Two, as an artist, the &quot;how much can we get for free'&quot; meme has NOT gone 
<BR>
away, art directors and homeowners and bosses always think artists &quot;aren't in 
<BR>
it for the moeny&quot;, and we always have to write airtight contracts, even WITH 
<BR>
recent copyrights and laws and so forth -- which were supposed to protect the 
<BR>
artist. 
<BR>
So in the case of Mettalica, let's say it doesn't harm them - IF the people 
<BR>
who are downloading are the same people who buy their records in used record 
<BR>
stores, lets say.
<BR>
But to survive, most artists work for MONEY, not for free. 
<BR>
<P>I want commensurate pay for any labor. Art and Music are very ardent - and 
<BR>
materials intensive - work, as are filmmaking and other stealable &quot;visual&quot; or 
<BR>
aural products. 
<BR>
(As in software, it's the original R&amp;D investment you try to protect, not 
<BR>
cost of disc)
<BR>
Music, being more easily divisible (so far) into 14 billion recordings - is 
<BR>
more vulnerable to stealing than visual arts - but we will soon see stealing 
<BR>
of film, animation, and other new media. 
<BR>
IF one  was to record my first CD, it'd take all this to create a quality 
<BR>
piece of music - Add it up: 
<BR>
- years of schooling, lessons and practice discipline
<BR>
- a time investment in writing the songs, and doing arrangements
<BR>
- an investment in my piano, synths, bass, drum machines, percussion 
<BR>
instruments etc.
<BR>
-an investment in finding the other band members and auditioning them, then 
<BR>
regular rehearsal times
<BR>
- any horn sections, DJ's or outside studio guys I'd need to get my sounds
<BR>
- an investment in midi, mics, a board, software, Avid, and whatever other 
<BR>
recording tech I need - or hire a sutdio at $**$$**** per hour.
<BR>
- cost of the CD itself - shopping the label OR coming up with the cash to 
<BR>
burn my own
<BR>
-cover art, promotional costs
<BR>
_  tour or club gigs to promote it 
<BR>
<P>It's the basic conundrum, if we aren't gonna get paid for this, at least in 
<BR>
SOME fashion.. why on earth would we make the art in the first place?  
<BR>
Because we LOVE you? And we want you to be Happy Napsters? 
<BR>
See, Napster is not paying the artist. But they are - as Emlyn pointed out- 
<BR>
getting something from them. Hi volume traffic. So it's sleazy. Reeeeeeal 
<BR>
sleazy.
<BR>
<P>The fans aren't... so they aren't really harming  us ?? ......its a tough 
<BR>
call.
<BR>
<P>Pirating is such a gray area, and my opinion is, if you're making money of 
<BR>
it, you should pay the gals/guys who created the &quot;intellectual property&quot;.  If 
<BR>
you pirate software to learn it, and you make a big killing off it, go back 
<BR>
and order the damn thing from the company!! 
<BR>
<P>If it sucks and you never use it - OK- you borrowed it for awhile, and no 
<BR>
harm done. uninstall. 
<BR>
<P>And,  if you are actually SO POOR you can't afford music, or the software or 
<BR>
whatever,  then steal it.  Like the chicks stealing Pampers in the LA?Rodney 
<BR>
King  insurrection.... 
<BR>
<P>Or, you're a &quot;Fuck You Corperate America&quot; type - Like Abby Hoffman' - Steal 
<BR>
This Book. And you dont WANT to pay the artists.. since their all a buncha 
<BR>
sell outs anyway! ( ; - )
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;But it's still stealing. Let's not pretend it's offered as free to begin 
<BR>
with.
