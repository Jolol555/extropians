Good luck, but I am not sure it will work. You are going to find yourself
<BR>
up against the Indians and other people who are to coding the equivalent
<BR>
that Mexico is for car manufacturers- cheaper labor. At least if you were
<BR>
in the US you could secure/lock-in some kind of job that is only possible
<BR>
in the flesh.

<EM>&gt; I'm afraid I'd get paid too much money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I've seriously contemplated it in recent times; it's not too hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (relatively speaking) for a computer geek to get him/herself (and family?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I would far prefer to live in Australia; I've not found anything lacking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here that is only available in the US, except maybe that my house doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be able to get a cable modem. But I only have to move suburb to fix
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that. And it's a pretty lovely country. I highly recommend a visit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometime; unfortunately we have similarly draconian immigration laws, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no special rules for IT people, so it's hard to move here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My current career goal (which is coming together rather nicely) is to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself working directly for US companies via pure teleworking, while staying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here. Nice exchange rate, you guys pay more, and all that. If I can get that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stabilised, which I think I am doing, the next step is to expand into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contracting other pure teleworking IT people, australians, working directly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for US companies. It's something which people have been talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (global employment market for knowledge work) for quite a while now, but has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not yet been realised.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The eventual goal, of course, would be to enable workers living in really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low cost of living countries to contract into the high cost of living, high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paying US. For example, I know people who would like to work out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Phillipines. Alternatively, it doesn't take long to find huge listings of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eastern europeans on the net who are immensly skilled in IT and unable to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find telework.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is something which will happen, I am quite sure. Currently there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barriers to making this kind of employment possible, but they are by no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means insurmountable. Mostly the barriers are attitudinal; these will change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quickly as the practice of hiring pure teleworkers becomes more widespread.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It will spread initially, for many areas of IT (esp software dev), because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you can get skilled people you will take them, however they come.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eventually the immense financial gains to all participants will be too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obvious to disregard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From my own experience, there are some hefty difficulties with telework, all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communication related. You've got to be a really proactive communicator to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make it work; ideally people at both ends are! But they are surmountable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and become increasingly so as the 'net infrastructure improves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mmm, topic drift. Anyway, my point is, I can get the benefits (work/money)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from here, keep the local benefits (lifestyle, less chance of getting shot),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have fun in the process. Why on earth would I want to move?

<EM>&gt; &gt; I am playing devil's advocate here... why aren't all you non-US folk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; moving here? Laying aside for the moment the INS/immigration issues-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if you could move here, why not? Most people seem to believe that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have pretty much the best freedom/interesting people/cheap real estate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the boonies/cheap gas/etc. etc. Have you become too dependent on your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; free medical care that you are afraid you wouldn't be able to hack it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here?
