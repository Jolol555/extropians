<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;A random person in the world will be chosen, and you get this choice:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a) Let them have $X more worth of real resources (such as by telling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to find an oil reserve that would otherwise remain unfound.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;b) Nothing happens.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Which do you choose?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I would choose not to give it to him. I do so because I know that if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; person (person Y) is wealthier, then that means that whatever wealth I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is lessened. If Joe X wants to sell some property and I want to buy it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; have if I let this person Y have the oil wealth which would otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; unfound, then there is more competition for the property I bidding for,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the price goes up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That does not follow unless you believe wealth is static.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm. Jargon? Dogma?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.  Knee-jerk? Confusion?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;competition if the person wants the same limited resource as you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is also one more person with more resources, which, if used wisely will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;produce more wealth for you and everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There was a tribe of protohumans in the valley. Protohuman Mac finds a nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chunk of chert (flint), hard to find in the valley. Previously, protohuman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Joe had the only chunk of chert in the valley and he was going to trade it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the semi-rancid gazelle carcass that some other protohuman had found,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and with that, he was going to lure that comely female protohuman Velma into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the bushes, and thereby pass on his genes. But now, with his bigger chunk of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chert, Mac gets to pass on his genes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you think Joe, if he were not able to get the chert himself, would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told Mac where it was? Velma womb is the limited resources here, ultimately.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>We are not protohumans and the situation is largely different.  I don't
<BR>
find the analogy terribly useful.  We are coming into times where we can
<BR>
tell the local matter assembler to build whatever physical object we
<BR>
might want/or need and where wombs are not necessarily only available in
<BR>
warm mammalian bodies of the appropriate gender.  My point is why drag
<BR>
values that work in a much more limited environment into what is
<BR>
increasingly a much less limited or extremely differently limited one? 
<BR>
Values that are not appropriate to now and to what is coming will get us
<BR>
killed or at least seriously limit our options. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bid adieu to the gene pool, then.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, increasingly the gene pool is under our own control.  Evolutionary
<BR>
reasoning of this limited scope is irrelevant.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There is a survival advantage only in a world of scarcity where even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;mere surival actually is pretty problematic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; THat's how it was and is. Even now, we often enforce artificial scarcity for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the most valuable resources in our society (medical care, real estate, etc).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even now, wealth is relative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>And a lot of that artificial scarcity is created and maintained and is
<BR>
&quot;artificial&quot; precisely because we haven't figured out how to rethink and
<BR>
rework our value systems and institutions yet.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The trouble is we haven't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thought past genetic conditioning that is largely outmoded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can you support that statement with examples?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>It is obvious from the above.
