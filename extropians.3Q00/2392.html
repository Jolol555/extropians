<EM>&gt;                 the hormone maker Monsanto led Fox TV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                 to fire two of its award-winning reporters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;                 and sweep under the rug much of what

<EM>&gt;                 they discovered but were never allowed to

<P>One of the telling statements in the tv story was that the cheif
<BR>
'scientist' claiming the danger to people says that if erythrymicin were
<BR>
in the milk, and people ate the milk, it would make their bodies more
<BR>
resistant to erythrymicin. However, its not the human body's resistance
<BR>
that is important, but the resistance of any diseases humans may
<BR>
contract, a significantly different thing.
<BR>
<P>I also found it rather telling that the reporters objections to Fox
<BR>
general counsel desiring balance in the story, which its apparent the
<BR>
reporters were not interested in, demonstrates the total lack of
<BR>
objectivity by the reporters, and thus the story is suspect.
<BR>
Additionally, its apparent that from the websites they link to, that
<BR>
this is some sort of campaign by anti-milk people promoting a lactose
<BR>
free diet, and while there is, on a related site, a few references to
<BR>
studies, none are linked to anything on the web, nor do the reporters
<BR>
provide ANY links to any studies done of IGF-1 impact on human health,
<BR>
which they claim is a 'growing body of evidence'. Great, lets see the
<BR>
evidence.
