<EM>&gt; (Modestly related) I rank gun owners -- your (and Mike's) mileage 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may vary -- 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in terms of safety as follows:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Safest:  target shooters.  Gun safety is inviolate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then:  military and police.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Next:  hunters.  Some are fine; others are the equivalent of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Massachusetts 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Least:  liberals who get a gun for self-defense.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I wouldn't use exactly the same labels as you did, David; but I do think
<BR>
it's important to recognize the difference between people who are trained
<BR>
to use a gun properly and who regularly practice that skill; and people
<BR>
who are not trained and current.  
<BR>
<P>When I was a kid, my father taught me how to use a gun when I was around
<BR>
8 years old, and I got my first rifle at the age of 10.  But my training
<BR>
(and my brother's) started well before that.  From the time we were old
<BR>
enough to understand, we were taught NEVER to point a gun at anything we
<BR>
didn't intend to shoot, not even a toy gun. I feel very uncomfortable
<BR>
when I see kids pretending to shoot each other with toy guns. This is a
<BR>
first step in the wrong direction away from gun safety.  
<BR>
<P>IMO people who buy guns for self defense but don't learn how to properly
<BR>
use them are in more danger than if they didn't own a gun, for 2 reasons:
<BR>
&nbsp;first, they might accidentally hurt themselves or others; second, having
<BR>
the gun often gives people a false sense of security so they don't take
<BR>
as many precautions as they ordinarily would to avoid trouble in the
<BR>
first place. Part of learning how to use a gun properly includes learning
<BR>
the limitations of the gun and of oneself.
