<P>(I agree that Brent is rapidly skipping from Robin's &quot;simple&quot; uploads
<BR>
to full sensory interleaving without a huge amount of work on exactly
<BR>
how this would be accomplished.  IMO, that is the *really* hard part --
<BR>
mapping individual neural nets onto a common experience message exchange
<BR>
format.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BTW here's another legal conundrum.  If the minimum wage is $5.50 /
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hour, and an upload runs 1000 times faster than a normal human, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should he get $5,500 / hour minimum?
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt the initial ones will.  Even if Blue Gene has a petaflops or
<BR>
10 or even 100, until the abstractions Robin discusses are developed
<BR>
a &quot;copyload&quot; is going to run *slow*.   That is why I don't think
<BR>
there will suddenly be the thousands of copies Robin proposes --
<BR>
you have to build real large (initially non-nanotech) computers
<BR>
on which to run them and those computers don't come cheap.
<BR>
If you still need 2000 sq ft of floor space (initial Blue Gene
<BR>
estimates), it sounds like you still have a data center and
<BR>
its associated costs (electricty, air conditioning, security,
<BR>
etc.).  If the published estimates of Blue Gene time (~1 year to
<BR>
solve the folding problem for a typical 300 amino acid protein, see:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.research.ibm.com/news/detail/protein_fact.html">http://www.research.ibm.com/news/detail/protein_fact.html</A>
<BR>
are accurate), then you are going to need *significant* hardware
<BR>
progress *and* some nifty compilation of the brain's processes
<BR>
to run the brain at &quot;real time&quot; rates.
<BR>
<P>I can see the advertisements now --
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Upload now -- In a single minute you can watch the rest of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world grow 50 years older...&quot;
<BR>
<P>(An interesting related &quot;trivia&quot; question would be whether
<BR>
the cost/&quot;volume&quot; of computer hardware has declined significantly
<BR>
over the last 40 years.)
