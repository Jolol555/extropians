That's nice, and all, but where in the report does it say that the
<BR>
organs in question have been indeed vitrified?
<BR>
<P>Perhaps a subject line with &quot;breakthrough in reducing cryoprotectant
<BR>
toxicity&quot; would have been more appropriate.
<BR>
<P>Truly an important result, empirically showing feasibility of
<BR>
extracting, loading, unloading and retransplanting a live animal
<BR>
kidney with cryoprotectant concentrations sufficient for
<BR>
vitrification, but this hasn't gone all the way yet. Nor is this about
<BR>
brains (mmmh, brains). So put the champagner back into the fridge,
<BR>
willya?

<EM> &gt; Permanent life support by kidneys perfused with a

<EM> &gt; vitrifiable (7.5 molar) cryoprotectant solution

<EM> &gt; Transplantation 70(1): 51-7 July 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Kheirabadi BS, Fahy GM
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; BACKGROUND: Vitrification (glass formation) is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; potential method for indefinite term organ preservation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that eliminates all of the conventional problems of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; freezing and thawing. A 7.5 M mixture of cryoprotectants
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; known as VS4 is sufficiently concentrated, in combination
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with applied pressure, to preclude ice formation entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; during cooling to below the glass transition temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; (about -125 degrees C), at which point vitrification takes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; place, arresting further changes over time.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; METHODS: Rabbit kidneys were perfused with VS4
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; according to three different protocols. The kidneys were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; evaluated using an autograft model with immediate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; contralateral nephrectomy.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; RESULTS: All three methods permitted long-term
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; survival, but the best results were obtained when the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; highest concentrations were perfused at about -3
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; degrees C. Using the latter protocol, the survival rate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; was 10/10, serum creatinine returned to a normal
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; baseline after transient elevation, other clinical chemistry
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; results normalized, and no histological damage was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; apparent 3 weeks after autografting.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; CONCLUSIONS: The results described provide the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; strongest evidence to date that it may be possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; bank kidneys for unlimited periods in the absence of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ice for later transplantation.
