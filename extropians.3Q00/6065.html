<P><EM> &gt; CYMM SAYS: Eugene it won't work. Betcha writing hyperintelligent AI is more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; addictive than heroin. If you can't stop people from writing klutzy computer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; viruses - how are you going to stop them from writing AI?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You can't stop them completely, but you can impose severe penalties,
<BR>
establishing deterrence, and create some infrastructure allowing you
<BR>
to detect and truncate worms in an early stage. Simple traffic pattern
<BR>
analysis will already help a lot. You'll see a node hitting other
<BR>
nodes with perversion packets (some of this will consist of varying
<BR>
traffic, trying to find a new hole), and some of those hit with a
<BR>
packet repeat same behaviour after a time. After it has found a good
<BR>
solution, the system will use the same packet for the same system
<BR>
type, so you could in principle filter it in realtime. You'll have to
<BR>
segment the Net, and use sanity checks, and remote
<BR>
(crypto-authenticated) restore to sane state, and the like. Of course
<BR>
the worm will adapt to countermeasures, but at least you will make it
<BR>
less easy.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
By reducing nucleation frequency and reducing the amount of
<BR>
computational resources available you can obviously reduce the
<BR>
risk. Whether it will be enough in end, who knows.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; And ...AI doesn't have to be very smart to be ultra destructive. The human
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; authour just has to be a psychopath, is all.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
In fact, a dumb yet truly mutable worm can sustainably shut down the
<BR>
net essentially for good. As long as there's a single infected node,
<BR>
reinfection is assured. The only way to combat this is 100% correct
<BR>
software (obviously impossible) or adaptively evolving immune system
<BR>
software, which will be based on the same principle which has enabled
<BR>
the worm, eventually ascertaining an equilibrium.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; CYMM SAYS: If he were a physical &amp; sovereign state, maybe. But such a
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I would literally nuke individual facilities, if a convincing
<BR>
threat is present. I'd say that should be a standard operating
<BR>
procedure in responses to Armageddon class threats. Colour me Vinge's
<BR>
Peacer, I guess.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; strategy hasn't been deployed with the drug production of Andean South
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; America... and I daresay it never will. Far less for, say, 20,000 or so 21
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; year olds scattered through university dorms and living rooms the world
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; over.
</EM><BR>
<P>Did you knew that they've started outlawing free Unices in selected
<BR>
college dorms?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; If it's possible - then humans may have to live with its inevitability.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; You may even see a whole cult of mind hackers by 2010. Whole multi terabyte
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hard drives (...or whatever...) with seriously camouflage-encrypted binaries
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that are decrypted on the fly. The cult of superhuman intelligence is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; enthralling... once it is practically realizeable - it will become a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; religion.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Do you think you can fight religion? And win?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; You're talking about the &quot;Artilect Wars&quot; all over again. But this is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; dirty, Vietnam-style war.... where people defend their God-given &quot;right&quot; to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; create God with a seething, righteous passion. Should be fun if you're into
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; war.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not. I don't like where the logics of it all is leading us. There
<BR>
must be a more constructive way out.
