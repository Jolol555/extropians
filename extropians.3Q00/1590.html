<BR>
<EM>&gt; I know it's been tossed about before, but I'm wondering if the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer geeky extros might like to put together a TH game? Between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those with coding skills, artists, musicians, and game design talent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (anders, that's you), we've got the right people. I know none of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has a lot of time, but together maybe we can make something. I'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking an opensource project (via sourceforge). I'm sure I contacted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone here about doing a game some time ago, and never followed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (sorry). If there were a few of us, we'd all be comitted (to each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other).
</EM><BR>
<P>Been there, done that, wrote the obit.  (I think there are still pages
<BR>
out there touting Project: Von Neumann, if anyone wants to go
<BR>
searching.)
<BR>
<P>If you want to do this, then define what the game *is*, and *is not*, up
<BR>
front.  If it's going to use a 2D sprite engine, so be it - once that
<BR>
decision is made, there can be no more &quot;wouldn't it be cool if we did
<BR>
3D&quot; decisions.  Likewise, if you decide to do it as 3D, then commit to
<BR>
it - either get an engine or get someone to write one that suits your
<BR>
needs - and don't backpedal into a 2D sprite engine.  Otherwise (in
<BR>
either case), you wind up in an infinite loop of suggesting new features
<BR>
that no one wants to write, exiting only on project abandonment, like
<BR>
so:
<BR>
Moderator: What do we want?
<BR>
Others: X!  It would be so cool if we had X!
<BR>
Moderator: Ok, who's going to do it?
<BR>
Others: ...
<BR>
Moderator: Ok, we're not doing X since no one's stepping up.  What else
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do we want?
<BR>
Others: X!  It would be so cool if we had X!
<BR>
Moderator: &gt;_&lt;  I give up.  See ya.
<BR>
Others: It would be so cool if we had Y!  Yeah!  Umm...hello?  Anyone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;still out there?
<BR>
<P>Now, the problem with an open source project is that you don't *get*
<BR>
that kind of control.  This can be fine once the game is developed and
<BR>
people are playing - few will seriously listen to someone who whines
<BR>
about the existing game not being 3D so long as it *is* existing - but
<BR>
in the early stages of the project, when all anyone can do *is*
<BR>
speculate and offer feature suggestions, this kind of feature creep can
<BR>
be fatal by preventing version 1.0 from ever materializing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd be most interested in doing a massively multiplayer online game;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might even be able to provide hosting. If there's enough groundswell,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; however, I'll back whatever everyone wants to do; I must be involved
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in writing a serious computer game at some point before I die
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (hopefully that's not soon, but hey).
</EM><BR>
<P>If you want to make a MMOG open-sourced, perhaps the worst problem
<BR>
you'll face is people hacking the code.  For example, VR is only
<BR>
pseudo-real so long as the artifacts of it being a computer program are
<BR>
not allowed to dispel the illusion; someone concerned solely with
<BR>
racking up points will want to reduce the program to what it is, with no
<BR>
concern for the illusion of reality which that user does not share.
<BR>
<P>Unless, of course, you want to encourage hacking, and see the effects of
<BR>
a Matrix-like envrionment where power goes to those who can manipulate
<BR>
&quot;reality&quot; the best.  Which might well fit in with the themes you wish to
<BR>
explore, though note that this kind of game would devolve to being about
<BR>
the game code itself, possibly including bots and other low-intelligence
<BR>
AIs, but not any elements that are in the game only by simulation...
<BR>
<P>(BTW, I'm only playing Devil's Advocate here to make sure you don't
<BR>
spend your energies on a project that will go down the tubes.  It's
<BR>
definitely possible to pull this kind of project off, but only with
<BR>
careful guidance, at least until you have a full game that can be played
<BR>
without spending significant energies to work around the installation or
<BR>
the bugs.  Either sucess or investment elsewhere would be preferable to
<BR>
failure.)
