</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.  What are the right tools?
</EM><BR>
<P>Online fora, particularly peer-moderated online fora where administrative
<BR>
privileges are aggressively distributed. Roundup will someday evolve into
<BR>
such a forum. In the meantime, we have some transitionary tools we can and
<BR>
should use and learn from. One thing is clear-- static web pages won't
<BR>
cut it anymore. There is too much information coming in too quickly for
<BR>
them to catch up, especially if they only have one part-time maintainer,
<BR>
as is usually the case. NanoDot, TransDot, PlanetX, and someday ExtroDot 
<BR>
are a start. However, we need more sites, and more diversity to evolve
<BR>
a truly optimal communication and information management scheme for our
<BR>
movement.
<BR>
<P>***** Zope, Slash, Crit, Everything2, Wikki, Roundup. If you have access
<BR>
***** to a PC, install one or more of these and see what interesting 
<BR>
***** stuff you can do. Even if your site doesn't catch on, you'll have
<BR>
***** at least learned something that will get you comfortably employed.
<BR>
<P>I can't emphasize this enough. The survival skill for people and
<BR>
organizations will be optimally handling information overload in the
<BR>
very near future. The ones best prepared, with the most convenient,
<BR>
low-friction tools will be the ones who set society's agenda for the
<BR>
next decade.
<BR>
<P>A central database of hands-on activities that can use more hands, be they
<BR>
software projects, charities (see HELPING PEOPLE below), collaborative
<BR>
writing, Extropian events, data collection, and in some cases even actual
<BR>
research and professional development. Sort of a META counterpart of
<BR>
Sourceforge.net.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;* *  I am currently waiting for the block of time to free up so that 
<BR>
&nbsp;* *  I can dig through the database structures and Perl code to implement
<BR>
&nbsp;* *   a crude, preliminary version of such a database on TransDot. If 
<BR>
&nbsp;* *  you are familiar with Slash internals, contact me! For all we know,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you might be a more suitable coordinator for such a project than I
<BR>
&nbsp;* *  am.
<BR>
<P>On the subject of collaborative writing, we need an Extropian organizing
<BR>
manual. Not the ideas, which are adequately explained in a huge number of 
<BR>
books and web pages, but the answer to a simple question: &quot;What can I, as 
<BR>
a non-millionaire and a non-PhD do to help you guys?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;* *  If you have few lines, a few pages, a few chapters, an organizing
<BR>
&nbsp;* *  manual you ripped off from some other organization... ANYTHING
<BR>
&nbsp;* *  that you think can be handy as seed content, email it to me and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will host it through the Crit scripts I have installed on 
<BR>
&nbsp;* *  MemeTree.com.
<BR>
<P>Politics! Yes, I know we don't like governments and want them to go away.
<BR>
Until they do, they're a power that we can either attempt to harness or let
<BR>
the sanctimonious weenies with loathesome superstitious luddite agendas 
<BR>
harness it uncontested. Concrete steps:
<BR>
<P>1. Someone needs to start an online database of politicians' voting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;records on technology, funding for basic research, privacy, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and civil liberties. Everyone ranging from labor unions to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religious groups to one-issue special interest groups publishes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a voting guide that assigns ratings to each candidate. I propose
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Extropy Institute publish its own voting guide. Okay, big
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project, lets start smaller. Let's start with California, and if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exers in other states/countries want to be published in the guide,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they can send in their own data. 
<BR>
<P>2. Once such a guide is published, contribute money to the campaigns
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of enlightened candidates. Write good stuff about them. Dig up dirt
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on their opponents. Vote for them. 
<BR>
<P>The media. We're getting better at this all by ourselves, and I'm not 
<BR>
particularly experienced in handling them anyway. Someone else should address
<BR>
what to do in this area, because it is important.
<BR>
<P>Local groups. Goal-- bring about a cultural milieau where anybody who feels
<BR>
like bouncing around some ideas about technology and society in person, over
<BR>
some drinks, without having to explain every third word... can find a like
<BR>
minded individual for such an activity within at most a few hours travel.
<BR>
<P>This won't happen everywhere at once, but in the places with the highest 
<BR>
density of Extropians, we should start making the transition from a virtual
<BR>
community to a real one. It's long been the case in California, Texas and 
<BR>
Sweden. Recently, I understand that a new group sprang up in the US Northwest
<BR>
and had a conference. We need to catalyze more small, local groups. The 
<BR>
Extropy institute already has the pieces necessary to start building this.
<BR>
Think: geographical NodeNet.
<BR>
<P>HELPING PEOPLE. Three obvious classes of charities around which to
<BR>
focus our efforts are first, transhuman/extropian non-profits, second
<BR>
research charities, and third, technology/knowledge transfer efforts to
<BR>
the disenfranchised of both the developed and the developing world.
