<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And really, as a businessman I am busy. Maybe I should take care more of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; store than with a quite technocratic movement that discusses bizarre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; computers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; So please explain to me why I should keep on being a transhumanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you are looking for short term, &quot;what do I do to change my life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;*right now*&quot; type of answers, you might not find them here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Transhumanism will not be achieved overnight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I might cut down on fat food. I might read some articles broadening my mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I might perhaps take a look on those concentration techniques. I might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand that perhaps that banning on cloning isn't such a groovy thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after all... (that's what it can do just thinking a few seconds)
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  I chose a poor phrasing.  I meant earth-shattering changes in
<BR>
your life that would take but a few seconds total; what you listed are
<BR>
long term changes, but they need to be applied again and again over at
<BR>
least multiple days for best impact.  (To take one of your examples: as
<BR>
opposed to, say, having a salad for dinner tonight but going right back
<BR>
on one's former diet tomorrow.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;However, there are always points in your life where you can make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;long-term decisions.  For instance, you are a businessman taking care of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a store.  What products do you sell?  If you are interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;promoting the vision discussed here, perhaps you could add some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;types of products discussed here to your wares.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In my business, clothes retail and import globalization has been an extremly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important factor. With transhumanism in can better understand the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connections behind that complex process, even what it means for MY company,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and if this process will continue and even develope. I can perhaps start to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; analyse future trends in fashion, given this given that. And let us not talk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about nanotechnology that completely eliminates most of the retail chain-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and makes me an information worker too. Gee, talk about new opportunities...
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;nods&gt;  And take a look at the recent &quot;improvements&quot; thread; many of the
<BR>
more cosmetic skin changes could also be done as new types of clothing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Mining for ideas is perhaps the best way you can take advantage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And creating those ideas, which means creating the future. But I cannot do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that if transhumanism is incoherent, then I cannot see the practical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implications of principles, neither can I understand their morality.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a bit of coherence.  Perhaps there is a bit much noise - but
<BR>
then, in any channel of communication where the signal to noise ratio is
<BR>
less than infinite, there is always &quot;too much noise&quot;.  One must see if
<BR>
one can get enough value out of the signal that comes through.  The
<BR>
content of the signals that discuss transhumanism, or at least this
<BR>
signal (this list), seems to convey significant value.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Whether you are one yourself depends on your personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;point of view - but there is a difference between being part of a group,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and getting benefit out of using what the group supplies freely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks, this sounds a lot more practical and sensible than &quot;leave the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movement&quot;;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Happy to oblige.  Transhumanism will bring much improvement to
<BR>
humanity if it suceeds, and at least part of this improvement will
<BR>
translate into dollars in someone's pocket.  (Check out the economists
<BR>
going back and forth over the increased world economy that spreading
<BR>
'Net use has brought, for just one example.)  Indeed, it seems likely
<BR>
that businesses will implement much of the vision, in a way that
<BR>
increases (or just plain generates) their profits.
