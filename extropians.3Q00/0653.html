<P>
Being the orginal post Natasha spoke about I take the liberty to post my 
<BR>
views on this important topic...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I first learned about and studied transhumanism in the Social Sciences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Department at the University of California and it was taught as a social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;science. The second place transhumanism was lectured was at EZTV Digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Exhibitions. Perhaps we are so smitten with the look and feel of &quot;hard&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sciences and technology that we don't think we are discussing social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sciences, aesthetics, economics, philosophy, etc.  *All* of the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;condition means &quot;all.&quot;  As for economics: why is it a far reach to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;knowledgeable about the analysis of the production, distribution, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consumption of transhuman goods and transhumanist services?
</EM><BR>
<P>The question I have often asked myself, is. Is transhumanism and 
<BR>
transhumanist technologies really possible to realize in EVERY economic 
<BR>
system? Are there some economic systems that encourage it, or stifle it? The 
<BR>
same goes for political systems, for philosophical basic assumptions (is 
<BR>
transhumanism possible to even concieve as an option with a Kierkegaardian 
<BR>
outlook on philosophy). That is why transhumanists must study these 
<BR>
disciplines too, and not be afraid to say thing like &quot;this economic system 
<BR>
is at odds with transhumanism&quot;, &quot;this political system helps the 
<BR>
proliferation of transhuman ideas&quot;. Transhumanism must build itself a world 
<BR>
view, which it presently doesn't have. And that isn't such a strange 
<BR>
occurrence after all, it takes a lengthy (and healthy) discourse to 
<BR>
construct such a thing, therefor it is of importance to do so now.
<BR>
<P>Philosophy is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;discussed each and every time we discuss the extropian principles. I never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considered it in intellectually gauche, in bad taste or professionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inappropriate to discuss areas of knowledge where one is not an expert, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does have considerable experience applying information to life by gathering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;specific knowledge through research, study, observation and common sense.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly not, one doesn't have to be a Ph.D. in philosophy to discuss it 
<BR>
(it is in undemocratic societies that people don't discuss philosophy).  
<BR>
Every philosophical discussion is not of relevance to transhumanist 
<BR>
philosophy though, especially if it's content is in controversy with 
<BR>
transhumanism. But building the transhumanist system which can be applied to 
<BR>
other fields requires a discourse, and a quite advanced one  at that. A 
<BR>
discourse that is aided by many proponents, and the building of a 
<BR>
transhumanist frame of reference. I must sadly say that the posts I have 
<BR>
seen in various mails on this list point to this not being achieved at the 
<BR>
present moment. I think this is a question of recruitment and education. 
<BR>
What signals do we send to the outside? What persons get interested in 
<BR>
transhumanism? What do they learn about transhumanism inside the movement, 
<BR>
and how do they react to it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What lies under our noses and which the author of this piece, as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anders missed is how society communicates -- by what methods, language and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;jargon, symbols and style.  Culture's communication technology are of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immeasurable significance to our future and our current relationship with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;society, and not giving relevance to the enormous impact of literature,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;music and images (moving or still) on culture and the influences these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;modes can and do impact on culture, is a loss for transhumanity.
</EM><BR>
<P>But what, Natasha, is the philosophical content being transcieved by those 
<BR>
methods, language, jargon, symbols, and style? What do we write on the 
<BR>
keyboard, what ideas do we imply with that painting? It has an impact, but 
<BR>
what impact? A computer can be used to transmit many kinds of ideas, even 
<BR>
ideas that vividly oppose to computers being used. A newspaper can be used 
<BR>
propagate the opinion of the abolishment of the freedom of press. The media 
<BR>
isn't synonymous with the message. And one must take care to look at what is 
<BR>
being said on this forum, which is one of the main foci of transhumanist 
<BR>
discourse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I find reading the journal &quot;Futures&quot; valuable, as there I often encounter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;radically different ideas about what a desirable future would be like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There have been papers discussing how to get *out* of this spiral of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technological advancement and into some nice, &quot;more human&quot;, static world -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an idea I find abhorrent as stated (because it implies that *everyone* must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do it), but is widely accepted in many circles. If we don't learn to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the real world issues well from *our* philosophical point of view, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;above view might well be what spreads into most economical and political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;solutions, badly cramping us.&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have used the word &quot;balance&quot; many times.  Balance knowledge, balance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;experience and balance information so that the scales do not tilt so far in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one direction that the an attention deficit results.  While walking around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;espousing far reaching concepts, our culture must know how to listen to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;verse.  What we need is to take a hard look at our culture and determine if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it can be a broad-based culturally effective, socially sophisticated 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of view including cross-disciplinary knowledge comprised of the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sophisticated sciences, technologies, arts and its communications.
</EM><BR>
<P>But what is the verse? What is the reaction of society towards us? To 
<BR>
understand it, and being able to respond to that in an appropriate manner we 
<BR>
need to have a world view, a description of history, present, and future, to 
<BR>
which we can refer. A sort of &quot;the great transhumanist narrative&quot; (although 
<BR>
it more open ended that previous &quot;great narratives&quot;). And I am currently 
<BR>
concerened about this- constructing a &quot;great narrative&quot; is such an alien 
<BR>
concept to many, it is the intellectual environment that most simply live 
<BR>
in, and absorb eclectically- a sort of &quot;that's the way things are&quot;, which 
<BR>
especially present in a society that contains a philosophical hegemony... 
<BR>
and that hegemony doesn't contain transhumanism at present, therefor it 
<BR>
influences transhumanists.
<BR>
<P>I hope this has clarified some. I know it's difficult, it's the result of a 
<BR>
lenghty discourse between me, Anders, and a few others. But it seriously 
<BR>
needs to be developed.
<BR>
<P>This weekend I re- read Virginia Postrel's excellent book &quot;The future and 
<BR>
its enemies&quot;. It was published waaaaay back in 1998, and I think it formed a 
<BR>
vital basis for a possible transhumanist discourse to build up a 
<BR>
transhumanist &quot;great narrative&quot;. But I haven't seen it been integrated into 
<BR>
the transhumanist frame of reference. On this list I have rather seen that 
<BR>
some would react to Postrel as a very controversial thinker.
<BR>
<P>Transhumanism is not a smorgasboard of ideas, or a &quot;bring your own&quot;. 
<BR>
Philosophical smorgasboards are not coherent, and therefor often weak 
<BR>
through their inherent contradictions. &quot;Bring your own&quot; introduces, often 
<BR>
badly supported biases and contradictions. And therefor transhumanism needs 
<BR>
a discourse to clarify its tenments and its world view.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;(snip)This is of course great, but it gave me pause to find that in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list of factors most likely to affect the next 1000 years immortality was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the second last place!  Also, note the relative ranking here (I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the index is simply the product of the probability, importance and priority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if they occur): (snip) I think the ranking tells us much about general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opinions on what is important.&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And how did he develop with this list of factors?  I think he deployed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;creativity. It seems to me that it is practical to emphasize the source of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;communications and meme breading.  It seems that it is an imbalance and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;narrow approach to not emphasize how we develop a broader base of reference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and knowledge.  In order to create new myths or to crack old ones, there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a need to express and otherwise represent and communicate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Natasha
</EM><BR>
<P>In order to create new philosophical currents that are appealing, one has to 
<BR>
bring forward an alternative that is practical and moral. And that requires 
<BR>
depth.
<BR>
<P>I look forward to your reply
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P>Waldemar
