<P><EM>&gt;I could buy a big fat physical book for $11 plus postage.

<P>I passed on this customer reaction to Steve at Fictionwise, who made the
<BR>
following response, which he's allowed me to repost here:
<BR>
<P>=============
<BR>
<P>Yes, there are people like that. But there are plenty others who don't
<BR>
feel this way. The price we've posted is a bit less than the australian
<BR>
newsstand price, so I don't understand the price issue. The purpose of
<BR>
ebooks is definitely not to offer books at a &quot;fraction of the cost.&quot; This
<BR>
is really a fallacy. An ebook should be priced a little lower than the
<BR>
print edition, but not at &quot;a fraction&quot; of the cost. (Unless the fraction
<BR>
you are talking about is 9/10.)  The printing costs for
<BR>
a physical paper back book are only about $1 out of a list price here in
<BR>
the usa of about $8. So by any reasonable logic the price should be about
<BR>
10 percent less for an ebook with the same content. What people are 
<BR>
paying for is the *content* not much the package.
<BR>
<P>We have over 2,100 readers at Fictionwise right now, and that is growing
<BR>
by about 1,000 per month. Most of these people read on Palm Pilot and
<BR>
Rocket Ebook platforms and are quite happy to pay what we're asking. And
<BR>
we have ample repeat sales to prove that this is not just a fluke. Currently
<BR>
nearly 25% of all our sales are repeat customers. We have several customers
<BR>
who have come back 4 or more times (and we've only been open about six weeks).
<BR>
We have several customers who have bought more than 60 titles and have spent
<BR>
close to $100.
<BR>
<P>Anyway,  there are skeptics and there are early adopters of any new technology
<BR>
and ebooks are no exception. All I can say is, the research shows that the
<BR>
early adopters are growing very rapidly in the ebook world, and we are
<BR>
reaching
<BR>
thousands of them already. Over the next 3 to 5 years, the early adopters will
<BR>
give way to the mass markets as the prices of handheld readers drops to the
<BR>
consumer &quot;impulse&quot; threshhold of about $40. And, we'll be there with plenty
<BR>
of content for them when they arrive.
<BR>
<P>If you want to see some arguments that go the other way, check out the
<BR>
newsgroups on <A HREF="http://www.ebooknet.com">http://www.ebooknet.com</A>  There are people there who say they are
<BR>
more than happy to pay the full hard cover price ($20 to $30) for ebooks.
