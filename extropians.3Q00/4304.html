<EM>&gt; There is the kicker - &quot;no competition&quot;!  In the past we had to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compete to survive.  That is the law when there is no other more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent way to progress.  But once anyone or anything achieves the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence required to progress more intentionally than via
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; all the rules change drastically.  No longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are we competing, now we are communicating and sharing.  If anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anywhere grows, learns, and so on and so forth, it is better for us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't think this is an accurate characterization.  The rules don't
<BR>
change at all; there is still fierce competition among intelligent,
<BR>
self-directed entities.  All that happens is that the competition moves
<BR>
out of the grossly physical domain for the most part.
<BR>
<P>The capability to project outcomes of actions as a result of increased
<BR>
intelligence and knowledge is most likely responsible for this shift. 
<BR>
The ability to accurately forecast the costs/benefits for a broad range of
<BR>
potential actions would encourage more subtle and less costly
<BR>
manipulations than brute force to achieve the same effective results in a
<BR>
competitive environment.  It also allows one to recognize losing
<BR>
positions and to cede them at the lowest possible cost. Maneuver is less
<BR>
costly than attrition and not as grossly destructive, but it requires
<BR>
superior situational intelligence to accomplish.
