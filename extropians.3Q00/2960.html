<EM>&gt; Being a hetero man (and one who was once falsely accused of fathering a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; child out of wedlock), your comments strike a chord with me.  However, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think the current state of affairs is the lesser of two evils.  If men
</EM><BR>
were
<BR>
<EM>&gt; able to say &quot;OK, I fathered this child, but I want nothing to do with it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and refuse to financially support it,&quot; I think that would impose an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unconscionable hardship upon single mothers and fatherless kids.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think a bigger problem would be proving that someone really has no
<BR>
responsibility here.
<BR>
<P>Also, I think there's an implication in most heterosexual sexual encounters
<BR>
that the goal is pleasure or affection -- not reproduction.  So, isn't there
<BR>
an implied contract here?
<BR>
<P>If society were so disposed as to side with Mark here -- making it totally
<BR>
the mother's responsibility -- do you really think that women would just
<BR>
produce more fatherless children?  Or would the incentive be either to
<BR>
abstain, use birth control (either partner), or practice sex which is less
<BR>
likely or unlikely to lead to pregnacy (such as oral sex)?
<BR>
<P>That said, I don't think too many women just squeeze out babies and assume
<BR>
the father will take care of them.  I did work with one, however, who got
<BR>
pregnant quite frequently, then would get abortions, and repeat the same
<BR>
thing again after recovering.  (I don't know if her strategy was just to
<BR>
live carefree without birth control or if she was just trying to hook a guy,
<BR>
then when the guy didn't want to get hooked, terminated the pregnancy.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what, its not the kids fault and the kid deserves to be provided for.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree here, but I think the question, who should be held accountable?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not by his dad, then by the state, which vicariously makes *me* (as a tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; payer) financially responsible for his kid.  Thanks but no thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Get rid of tax funding of this stuff and you won't be a vicarious father.
<BR>
Notably, when welfare in NJ no longer paid extra for more children, the
<BR>
birth rate of welfare mothers went down.
<BR>
<P>Later!
