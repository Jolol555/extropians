<P>Corey,
<BR>
Thanks for the interesting discussion.  I am not a political expert or
<BR>
expert on libertarianism especially.  I am sure there are others here
<BR>
much more qualified on those grounds.  But I will give my opinion in
<BR>
response to your own.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As a first point, many of the libertarian principles that I have seen seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a slightly repackaged form of some of the more practical theories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarchism.  In this case, it almsot seems libertarianism is an example of both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predictive anarchism and possibly a series of templates for the construction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of social temporary autonomous zones (and here is where I fail in attribution;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this idea is NOT mine).  But as such, I see the problems that associate with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anarchism raising their heads:  The difficulty of organizing projects that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; require more than one or two indiviuals and/or more than the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifetime of the project organizer, the issues raised under the heading &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tragedy ofthe Commons&quot; (including and especially environmental effects),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the strong potential for pockets of tyranny and other social systems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rise and slowly absorb and perhaps subjugate those neighboring., either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognitively or grographically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>To me libertarianism is not necessarily rooted in anarchism at all.  It
<BR>
is primarily routed in strong concepts of individual rights.  That is
<BR>
certainly NOT the same as anarchy although many might argue that anarchy
<BR>
is a natural result or at least an extrapolation that needs to be
<BR>
considered.  But libertarianism is first and foremost the notion that
<BR>
the individual is sacrosanct and that the state (if any) exists to serve
<BR>
the needs of the individuals and provide a bit of infrastructure (if
<BR>
any) that cannot better be provided by private means.  Different
<BR>
Libertarian theories exist concerning what (if any) genuine roles there
<BR>
are for a State.  It would incorrect to claim libertarianism as such is
<BR>
a form of anarchism.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; As a second point, there seesm to be a strong technological requirement - one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of which we cannot be so sure is feasable to attain with our current knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of chemistry, physics, and biology.  While the application of this sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy woul dbe applicable with the requisite technology (and admittedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a very good thought experiment and planning project), I am concerned about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its direct applicability (i.e. without MNT, is the possibility of the MNT-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enabled being worth discussing as anything but one of a number of possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; futures?)  With our current technology, some of the goals that would doubtless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be amenable to this mindset (including and especially extraplanetary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; habitation) seem to be difficult if not impossible to achieve without either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outstanding personal wealth and power (enabling one person the role of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benevolent tyrant), or it would require an association of people within some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sort of framework that could (and arguably should, to a degree) be considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coercive/limiting of personal freedom.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I would point out that libertarianism is close to classic liberalism and
<BR>
by modern standards the founders of the country largely founded it on
<BR>
libertarian principles.  They worked, generally, pretty well excepting
<BR>
growing ugliness of increased government without the bounds built-in
<BR>
being sufficient to stop it and other ugliness of the times like slavery
<BR>
and lack of female suffrage.  It obviously does not take ultra-high tech
<BR>
to run a country on basically libertarian principles.   I have no idea
<BR>
why you would think things like MNT are necessary for libertarianism to
<BR>
work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a third point, on a purely systemic approach, it seems that somehow the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; key features of a libertarian system in practice rely upon some sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; external power structure beyond the libertarian sphere.  AS an example, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; go back to the environmental protection issue I raised in an earlier thread,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where NGOs (particularly the Sierra Club) were suing to prevent certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environmental damages from happening.  But to be able to sue, you require a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; court system.  A court system must have a way of enforcing its rulings (one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can say a great deal about &quot;binding arbitration&quot; - but if one party doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the arbitrator's ruling, that's breach of contract - and back into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; courts.).  That enforcement is by nature corercive, and therefore counter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to what I understand as alibertarian philosophy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Liberatarians are quite diverse, as I mentioned, about what legitimate
<BR>
functions they believe something like a State might have.  Courts, law
<BR>
making and enforcement and military were Ayn Rand's take (please no
<BR>
flames about why she really is not a libertarian).  There are arguments
<BR>
that these and/or other things cannot be efficiently and peaceably
<BR>
handled by private parties. 
<BR>
<P>But Libertarianism only requires respect for individual rights, for
<BR>
liberty.  It does not in an of itself require no State.  Some type of
<BR>
State is not incompatible with Libertarianism according to many
<BR>
theorists.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; As a fourth point, there are assumptions made about human nature, for lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a better phrase, that I cannot simply accept.  I don't beleive anyone can say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the members of this list are a statisicaly (sp?) random or representative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sample of society at large.  In fact, I would trust (to a greater extent) a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarian type system if the only people within it were highly educated,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thoughtful, and forward looking like most everyone on this list is.  But that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is unfortunately not representative of society at large in nearly any nation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it is that fact that troubles me most about a &quot;non-coercive&quot; system.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a Pyhrric victory at best to know that the group to which I subscribe for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law and justice will track down the group o ffundamentalists that lynched me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (for whatever reason - I could give 10 or 20 that would put me high on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; list of most religious organizations) - that doens't make me any less dead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ANd one can speak a great deal about the personal incentive to protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onesself as well - but 15 people with equivalent armament to myself will,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistically, overcome my own defense, if they care enough about killing me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to outweigh their numbers. They might even get lucky and not take significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; casualties.  (see the above section on technology for why this is a &quot;primitive&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Libertarianism does not require being totally &quot;non-coercive&quot;.  That is a
<BR>
great misunderstanding.  Your freedom does not extent to initiated force
<BR>
against me and thereby denying my freedom.  But stopping a madman or a
<BR>
murder or someone engaging in the initation of force is not at all
<BR>
incompatible.  It is actually required.  The initiation of force is from
<BR>
the perp.  You are stopping the threat to human rights from continuing.  
<BR>
<P>Do you feel better knowing that the State police will eventually track
<BR>
down your killers?  How about if you have the freedom to carry arms and
<BR>
use them if your life is threatened?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The reason I do not have a philosophy of my own is that in my searche I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not found anything that balances mechanisms of restriction and enablement.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; am not a believer in absolute freedom - as it stands now.  I am seeking a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical political philosophy, not somethign that works well in theory, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't seem likely from where I stand to survive first contact with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enemy.  Its just disheartening to see the most promisig method of achieving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the end results with which I sympathize wrapped up in a philosophy that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot accept in its entirety as presented.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Liberatarians do not believe in absolute freedom either.  Absolutes are
<BR>
for mystical tracts.  We live in the real world.  Freedom does not
<BR>
include the right to deny me my freedom.  It is not unlimited.  
<BR>
<P>Perhaps you should check more deeply into what Libertarianism does and
<BR>
does not say before being sorry many extropian folks embrace some or all
<BR>
(if that is even possible with something so diverse beyond the basics)
<BR>
of it.
