<EM>&gt; &gt;Theres an example of attractive yet definitely non-

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but good grief, I went and took a look to check, and she too has a skewed

<EM>&gt; face, one eye slightly higher than the other!

<EM>&gt; This is soooo off extro-topic.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [but I don't care]

<P>No human is symmetrical.  As example, the right and left lungs are different.
<BR>
<P>It (asymmetry) is to some extent a sign of specialization.  Flatworms
<BR>
(planara) are symmetric.
<BR>
<P>By the same token, extreme asymmetry is not good, that being simply a
<BR>
Darwinian disadvantage, for example, lack of a limb.  Other of the
<BR>
individual's advantages might make up for it thus that they procreate.
<BR>
<P>Many or perhaps most people do not have natural parts in their hair down the
<BR>
middle of their heads.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I am not symmetrical but close enough for my own satisfaction.
<BR>
As a youth I wore braces on my teeth, they were not crooked but rather I had
<BR>
an overbite.  There might be half a centimeter difference in respective arm
<BR>
and leg length, I have never measured them, my fingertips match when I put my
<BR>
elbows together on the table with perhaps a millimeter difference.  If you
<BR>
know what I look like I have gained some weight and have shorter hair.
<BR>
<P>I look in the mirror to see which eye is higher, and can not tell the
<BR>
difference as I do not recall specificity of any previously noted asymmetry,
<BR>
except my left eyebrow is cocked perhaps sarcastically.  When I smile it is
<BR>
generally moreso with the right side of my face.  Expressions are often
<BR>
asymmetric, I would think because of personal affectation and asymmetric
<BR>
brain lobe emotion responsibility.
<BR>
<P>I removed my contact lenses yesterday, I am very nearsighted.  I notice that
<BR>
the focussing adapts so that after twenty minutes or upon serious
<BR>
concentration after removing contact lenses that my vision self-corrects.  I
<BR>
replace them in my eyes as even after that they can see no detail beyond
<BR>
three feet away.
<BR>
<P>In the context of this I would say that I am self-centered but not
<BR>
narcissistic.
<BR>
<P>Milano appears to have a tattoo on her left leg.  In terms of which Charmed
<BR>
actress is most attractive, that is a difficult choice.  I can't say to have
<BR>
ever noted asymmetry in any of them, or in any TV actor, for that matter, it
<BR>
or it's absence is not something that is sought.
<BR>
<P>Now then, about love, love is a many-splendored thing.
<BR>
<P>Among most biological creatures, love is a euphemism for the procreative
<BR>
drive and two people's proclivity towards it.
<BR>
<P>For most mammals and many other creatures, that means pheromones, those
<BR>
largely otherwise undetectable odors that emanate from the body signifying a
<BR>
wide variety of physical states, among them sexual readiness or proclivity.
<BR>
<P>Most humans have undeniable visual input as a large factor in attraction.
<BR>
The other less overriding senses are also obviously factors.
<BR>
<P>There is that physical love and then there is the more spiritual, if you
<BR>
will, or intangible personal love, where the love is based upon a sense of
<BR>
caring towards the other.
<BR>
<P>Non-sexual or not-necessarily-sexual love is different things for different
<BR>
people in regards to different things that are loved.
<BR>
<P>Love implies warmth and fulfillment, as well as its flip side..
<BR>
<P>Love is probably the most numerously enumerated theme in music lyrics.
<BR>
Country music has songs about dogs, guns, trucks, beer, and love, hip hop
<BR>
songs about gin, grass, gangs, g-love, and love, and pop music about pop
<BR>
music and love, with love songs being about love.  Many songs have love in
<BR>
the title, from &quot;Is This Love?&quot; to &quot;Now That We've Found Love&quot; to &quot;What Time
<BR>
is Love?&quot;  There simply are not that many songs about oil filter gaskets.
<BR>
<P>I love my family and friends and everything at some level.  I think I have
<BR>
been in love.
<BR>
<P>Have a niec day,
<BR>
<P>Ross
