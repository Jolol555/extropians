<P>
Space exploration and colonization.  This is one of the biggest, if not the
<BR>
biggest, endeavor mankind has encountered in the history of civilization.  It
<BR>
is, however, going to require us to rethink some of our most basic assumptions 
<BR>
about how we measure value and economy, and how we deal with so-called common
<BR>
goods, and &quot;unaccounted costs&quot; of business and living.
<BR>
<P>The basic assumptions about value and scarcity have to be reconsidered.  Things
<BR>
that we take for granted here on earth (breathable air, clean water, protection
<BR>
from radiation) are all commodities of a remarkable scarcity on another world.
<BR>
Unless you are underwater or buried underground, you can always take a breath
<BR>
(and unless you're near a chemical spill or volcanic eruption, odds are it's
<BR>
life-sustaining).  In an extra-terrestrial colony situation, however, air is a
<BR>
limited resource.  The same goes for water, and even food - you can't forage
<BR>
the surface of Mars, so any kind of food production collapse inherently means
<BR>
famine.  Thus the basis fr the economy is very different - it isn't based on
<BR>
the assumption that a life, albeit an uncomfortable one, is attainable even
<BR>
if you are somehow excluded from the economic system.
<BR>
<P>The idea o value will also take a radical change.  Things that are considered
<BR>
economically inviable (i.e. widespread photovoltaic electricity production, 
<BR>
micro-scale chemical manufacturing, commercial hydroponics) suddenly become 
<BR>
more valuable given the constraints of limited &quot;traditional&quot; resources (no 
<BR>
petrochemicals to start with) and limitations of other &quot;non-traditional&quot; 
<BR>
resources (pure water, volume for production, constant air pressure, human
<BR>
resources).  Economies of scale are less useful with a limited market and the
<BR>
specialized needs te environment poses.  This will lead to a rethinking of 
<BR>
economic production, one would hope, since for a time huge refineries and 
<BR>
power plants are unlikely at best.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Unaccounted costs&quot; will be the area where business practices and economic
<BR>
estimates will have to chang themost, however.  Such &quot;unaccounted&quot; costs of,
<BR>
say, an automobile-based transportation system include air pollution, water
<BR>
pollution, noise pollution, increased road maintenance, and the possibility of
<BR>
increased cancer rates, plus the extra space required to store and maintain a 
<BR>
vehicle.  In a closed, limited environment with negligible carrying capacity
<BR>
for pollutants, a slight fouling of the air will not be carried away by the 
<BR>
breeze or the next storm - there IS no next storm.  Additionally, something
<BR>
that contaminates water will either have to be filtered or the water discarded,
<BR>
making water a non-renewable resource in the end.  And any space that becomes
<BR>
too fouled to use will be lost - at a time when space/volume is limited.
<BR>
<P>Common goods become critical because those things everyone share will have
<BR>
to me actively maintained.  It won't be acceptable, for example, for leaky
<BR>
gas lines in a domed setting - indeed, the enclosed structure in this case 
<BR>
is a major common good that needs to be maintained.  This requires the 
<BR>
vigilance and maintenance by some sort of organization - a government, perhaps,
<BR>
or a &quot;non-aligned&quot; (non-profit?) corporation that maintains, repairs, and
<BR>
upgrades these facilities.  
<BR>
<P>The worst possible situation to arise here is that there is no prior economic
<BR>
system to build up from, or to revert to if mistakes have been made.  The 
<BR>
economy must be capable of tuning itself and running sustained from the 
<BR>
beginning, lest it crash and the entire economic infrastructure fail.  This
<BR>
may be the most difficult task (economically speaking) facing a colony - until
<BR>
it is constructued and begins to be populatd, it can rely upon external 
<BR>
economic inputs.  Once it is established, however, it may need to quickly
<BR>
establish its own economic reality or face irreconcilable economic hardship.
<BR>
<P>In the end, the old economc models will be inadequate for dealing with the 
<BR>
critical first year or two of an established extraterrestrial colony's 
<BR>
existence.  How these questiosn ar edealt with in the planning stages could 
<BR>
set thestage for the success or failure of mankind's presence as a resident
<BR>
and habitant of other worlds.
