<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<BR>
B Cells found to be important in HIV infection
<BR>
<P>Researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease
<BR>
(NIAID) have found that the body's B cells play a role in human
<BR>
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. This discovery should prove to be
<BR>
helpful in finding ways to eliminate the virus. B cells are the antibody
<BR>
producing cells of the immune system. Because HIV destroys T cells,
<BR>
another type of immune system cell, research has focused on T cells rather
<BR>
than B cells. The research, published in the most recent Journal of
<BR>
Experimental Medicine found that B cells are involved in the transport of
<BR>
HIV through the blood and very likely deliver it to the T cells. The
<BR>
researchers found high levels of the virus on the surface of B cells
<BR>
isolated from patients with chronic HIV. They were then able to use these
<BR>
cells to infect T cells in vitro (outside the body). B cells and T cells
<BR>
are continually interacting with one another in the body, which enables
<BR>
the B cells to infect the T cells. However, the B cells do not hold
<BR>
internal reservoirs of the virus, as it merely attaches to their surface.
<BR>
Lead study author Susan Moir, PhD, explained, &quot;HIV does not appear to
<BR>
reproduce inside B cells, but rather hitches a ride on the cell surface so
<BR>
it is free to jump to nearby T cells . . . People with high levels of HIV
<BR>
in the blood often have malfunctions in their B cell responses, such as
<BR>
uncontrolled activation of antibody production. In the past, scientists
<BR>
have thought this was caused largely by indirect effects of HIV infection,
<BR>
but now we have evidence that some B cell abnormalities might be due to
<BR>
direct viral interference.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The next step in this research is to determine if HIV found in T cells is
<BR>
genetically related to that in B cells, to verify that the B cells were
<BR>
the source of their infection.
<BR>
<P>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director, Anthony
<BR>
Fauci, MD, commented, &quot;This study enhances our understanding of how HIV
<BR>
persists in the body and might partly explain the abnormalities seen in
<BR>
B-cell function in people with HIV infection. Identifying this pool of
<BR>
HIV-carrying cells also opens new avenues for treating the infection.&quot;
<BR>
<P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
HIV
<BR>
<P>Since 1985, several thousand medical papers have provided evidence that
<BR>
HIV-related immune-system destruction directly correlates with
<BR>
deficiencies of specific hormones, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids
<BR>
(AIDS, 1997; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1997; J. Nutr., 1994).
<BR>
<P>Free radicals have been linked to much of the immune system destruction
<BR>
caused by HIV. The HIV-induced cellular depletion of glutathione is
<BR>
associated with free radical injury to numerous immune-system components.
<BR>
A wide range of antioxidants have been shown to protect immune function,
<BR>
and nutrients that maintain cellular levels of glutathione are especially
<BR>
important in preventing or slowing the progression of HIV infection.
<BR>
T-helper lymphocytes require adequate levels of glutathione to function
<BR>
normally, and HIV induces oxidative stress that depletes T-helper cells of
<BR>
glutathione (Res. Immunol., 1992).
<BR>
<P>Regular blood tests are an essential part of an HIV treatment program. The
<BR>
chemistry profile includes iron, glucose, liver and kidney function, WBC,
<BR>
RBC, platelet count, and other important tests. These tests can detect
<BR>
blood changes that may indicate the presence of, or predisposition to, a
<BR>
wide range of abnormalities. They are a crucial source of information to
<BR>
assess the effects of drugs or nutrients which may be causing liver
<BR>
toxicity and kidney or heart muscle damage. These tests should be
<BR>
performed at least semiannually. Specific tests could be repeated more
<BR>
often to monitor the efficacy of the current therapies you are using. Test
<BR>
information is a valuable component of the therapy decision-making process
<BR>
and should be utilized by all people with HIV undergoing prescription
<BR>
antiviral medication. The Foundation would like to remind you that correct
<BR>
test result interpretations depend on the knowledge and experience of
<BR>
trained clinical scientists. Therefore, it is recommended that you work
<BR>
closely with your primary care physician or qualified laboratory scientist
<BR>
when evaluating test results.
<BR>
<P>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is required for normal host defense and
<BR>
functions. An analysis of vitamin C uptake and its effects on virus
<BR>
production and cellular proliferation was performed. Exposure to high
<BR>
concentrations of vitamin C preferentially decreased the proliferation and
<BR>
survival of HIV-infected cells, and caused decreased viral production.
<BR>
This study showed high concentrations of vitamin C were preferentially
<BR>
toxic to HIV-infected host cell lines in vitro (Am. J. Clin. Nutr., 1991).

<BR>
<P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Catabolic Wasting
<BR>
<P>Catabolic wasting or cachexia is a clinical wasting syndrome that is
<BR>
characterized by unintended and progressive weight loss, weakness, and low
<BR>
body fat and muscle. At least 5% of body weight is lost. Cachexia is not
<BR>
caused by poor appetite and nutritional intake but rather by a metabolic
<BR>
state in which a &quot;breaking down&quot; rather than a &quot;building up&quot; occurs in
<BR>
bodily tissues no matter how much nutritional intake occurs. Additionally,
<BR>
whether a patient receives nutrition orally or intravenously makes no
<BR>
difference. The patient simply cannot gain weight, so eating more is not
<BR>
an answer.
<BR>
<P>It is estimated that one half of all cancer patients experience catabolic
<BR>
wasting, with a higher occurrence seen in cases of malignancies of the
<BR>
lung, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract. The syndrome is equally common
<BR>
in AIDS patients and can also be present in bacterial and parasitic
<BR>
diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic diseases of the bowel, liver,
<BR>
lungs, and heart. It is usually associated with anorexia and can manifest
<BR>
as a condition in aging or as a result of physical trauma. Catabolic
<BR>
wasting is a symptom that diminishes the quality of life, worsens the
<BR>
underlying condition, and is a major cause of death.
<BR>
<P>Scientists have examined the impact of whey protein concentrate on
<BR>
preventing or treating catabolic wasting, immune dysfunction, and cancer.
<BR>
A study involving HIV-positive men fed whey protein concentrate found
<BR>
dramatic increases in glutathione levels, with most men reaching their
<BR>
ideal body weight. In another study, when different groups of rats were
<BR>
given a powerful carcinogen, those fed whey protein concentrate showed
<BR>
fewer tumors and reduced tumor masses.

<BR>
<P>PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
<BR>
Life Extension Enhanced Protein
<BR>
<P>Recently, a new production method has produced a whey protein isolate that
<BR>
provides even better health maintenance and disease prevention benefits
<BR>
than previous products. Using a low temperature microfiltration technique,
<BR>
it is now possible to produce a 98% undenatured whey protein isolate that
<BR>
retains all the important subfractions, such as lactoferrin, a strong
<BR>
antioxidant having antimicrobial and antiviral properties, that also may
<BR>
be a powerful immune stimulant.
<BR>
<P>Enhanced Life Extension Protein is a third generation whey protein
<BR>
containing four times as much lactoferrin as most other whey protein
<BR>
supplements on the market, and is, to our knowledge, the only such whey
<BR>
protein supplement that contains added lactoferrin.

<BR>
<P>Disease Prevention and Treatment Protocols now on CD
<BR>
<P>Disease Prevention and Treatment is a 946 page textbook containing inside
<BR>
information about therapies innovative physicians are using to prevent and
<BR>
treat the degenerative diseases of aging, and is now on cd. Gaining access
<BR>
to this knowledge enables one with a serious medical disorder to take
<BR>
advantage of these advanced therapies immediately, rather than waiting
<BR>
years for conventional medicine to catch on. It is a well known fact that
<BR>
people die even though effective treatments may already exist for their
<BR>
diseases. Disease Prevention and Treatment breaks down the barriers of
<BR>
scientific ignorance that keeps life-saving knowledge away from those who
<BR>
need it.

<BR>
<P>LIFE EXTENSION FORUM
<BR>
<P>The Life Extension Forums function similar to Internet Moderated
<BR>
Newsgroups in that all submitted messages must first be approved by the
<BR>
Moderator. The purpose of moderation is not to prevent criticism or
<BR>
dissenting viewpoints, but to enable the frank exchange of information
<BR>
without the extraneous &quot;junk&quot; and personal bickering which often occurs on
<BR>
Internet newsgroups and lists. In addition, to prevent the propagation of
<BR>
disinformation and provide correct information in as timely a manner as
<BR>
possible, the Life Extension Forums Moderator usually adds comments to
<BR>
statements and answers to questions within the submitted message before
<BR>
posting it.
<BR>
<P>As with Newsgroups, each forum contains a broad category of subjects
<BR>
indicated by the name of the forum. Users can select a forum category of
<BR>
interest, search for a particular topic, switch to another forum category,
<BR>
initiate a new discussion thread within a forum, or submit replies to
<BR>
individual messages within existing discussion threads.
<BR>
<P>Users of the Life Extension Foundation Forums are not required to
<BR>
register. However, once these functions are fully implemented,
<BR>
registration will allow a user to a) subscribe to a forum (receive email
<BR>
notification of new messages which appear in that forum), b) be notified
<BR>
with a copy when the moderator posts his/her message, c) keep track of
<BR>
read and unread posts, and d) hide his email address from public view,
<BR>
while still allowing personal replies.
<BR>
<P>Each forum allows the user to rate the quality or importance of a thread,
<BR>
and keeps a count of how many times each thread has been viewed. The set
<BR>
of threads in a forum may be sorted by date, poster name, subject text,
<BR>
user rating, and view count.
<BR>
<P>Visit Life Extension Forum, and join the discussion of hundreds of life
<BR>
extension subjects.  General headings include:  Dietary supplements,
<BR>
Hormones, Dietary Xenobiotics, Topicals, Use of Foods, Lifestyles,
<BR>
Disorders/Diseases, Social/Political aspects, Miscellaneous Topics, and
<BR>
(just added) Physician Reviews.
