<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Listen, the fact of the matter is that technology can overcome any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;barrier to entry&quot; that you might like to erect.  Including timely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; transmission, or whatever other attribute you'd like to try to use to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; your intellectual property valuable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; If the broadcast is over a cable channel, where all subscribers have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; contracts to not re-use data, then copyright is irrelevant AND the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; value of timliness is retained.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Then what will happen is if you try to broadcast in violation of contract,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; packets can also be jammed, and you can then be sued via the PPL network.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Firstly, it doesn't matter if its over a cable channel-- that's no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; security-- I've got a pure stream of cable coming in my house and I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; re-broadcast that signal, no problem.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Secondly, this whole concept of signing contracts to not re-use data is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really just a form of content ownership which is apparently the thing you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguing against.
</EM><BR>
<P>No its not. A copyright is an unsigned social contract enforced by law, where
<BR>
private use contracts where the parties explicitely agree to the terms prior to
<BR>
the release of information are entirely different. Your failure to understand
<BR>
this difference is exactly why you continue to try to argue these points. I
<BR>
(mostly as a devils advocate), and I beleive Lee, argue for the right of other
<BR>
original artists who independently create identical or near identical artwork to
<BR>
be able to derive a use from that art without be hamstrung by prior art by
<BR>
others that is protected by law under copyright laws. Both of us have argued
<BR>
that private means of protecting one's intellectual property are quite
<BR>
sufficient to recoup a profit on one's work.
<BR>
<P>Here you are trying to change the subject now. Point blank is you don't want to
<BR>
be bound by the contracts you enter into. Fine. There are a lot of people who
<BR>
don't want to be bound by restrictions on hunting seasons on human beings. Lets
<BR>
say we loosen both of them up... ;-P
