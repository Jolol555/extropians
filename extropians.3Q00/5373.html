<P>&lt;&lt; Spudboy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if you read a little among Christian theologians you will find a 
<BR>
&nbsp;quite different take on the God question.  BTW, that last sentence may 
<BR>
&nbsp;include a lot of Jewish theologians and others; it is just that Christians 
<BR>
&nbsp;are what I am familiar with.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people consider the old and new testament as the story of man's 
<BR>
&nbsp;attempt to come to grips with the question of God.  Under that approach they 
<BR>
&nbsp;would all be properly labeled as &quot;searchers&quot; or some such.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the vastness of the universe I find many discussions of this 
<BR>
&nbsp;subject beginning with &quot;I believe.........&quot; to be presumptive.  In addition 
<BR>
&nbsp;given that no one has yet hauled God kicking and screaming into either a 
<BR>
&nbsp;laboratory or a courtroom to testify under oath then it appears that many 
<BR>
&nbsp;statements testifying to the exact nature of God to be equally presumptive.
<BR>
&nbsp;A searcher. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
There are vast differences, for example, between Judaism and Christianity, 
<BR>
then say Islam and Christianity. Lots of philosophers and theologians, as you 
<BR>
already know, would like to bring God to court, many for breach of promise! 
<BR>
Saying I believe is a statement of honesty, saying, I know, is where the real 
<BR>
presumtion comes along. We don't know, and its also ok, for someone to say  
<BR>
&quot;I don't care&quot; at least its honest, and it free's people up from carrying on 
<BR>
a crusade against the religious or quasi-religious.  MY opinion is just like 
<BR>
Chucky Marx, the 19th century transhumanist, who believed in classless 
<BR>
societies and that Religion acts as a pain-killer for life's miseries. My 
<BR>
only concern is that the  painkiller may not be powerful enough. Until 
<BR>
technology can change the human condition, what to do? Soma anyone?
