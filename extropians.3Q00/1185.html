<P>
<EM>&gt;  Eliezer S. Yudkowsky
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm sorry, but this discussion has gotten *silly*.  There is no way on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Heaven or Earth or all the Stars between that you can have that kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence running loose and still be debating whether to pay it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minimum wage.  The first upload is going to spend a few hundred years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (subjective) upgrading the neural networks, and then he or she or ve will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; walk out of there and take over the world.  Or build a seed AI.  They are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not, repeat not, going to be flipping burgers at McDonalds.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thank you.  I have been wondering about the premises of this discussion
<BR>
for some time now.  The same problem arises with regard to Robin's [If
<BR>
Uploads Come First].  The discussion is missing exactly what Eliezer points
<BR>
out and what I thought was an assumption by most of the people on the list:
<BR>
having a completely modifiable mind changes everything.
<BR>
<P>I realize that such a speculation does not somehow automatically annul the
<BR>
world's existing economic, legal, political, and social structures or
<BR>
momentum.  But, really, even if millions of copies are made of a diligent
<BR>
architect or consultant or speech-writer upload, people won't have years in
<BR>
which to decide whether or not their portfolios are bleeding diversified
<BR>
enough to express their righteous mutual-fund outrage.  Like everyone in
<BR>
the world has vast portfolios to begin with.
<BR>
<P>Let's return to assessing the possible paths leading to the proliferation
<BR>
of the basic technology for uploading.  Early in this or a related thread
<BR>
someone (Robin, perhaps) dismissed Robert's claim that slow, integrative
<BR>
uploads will lose timewise to scanned, destructive uploads.  I'm not sure
<BR>
that I was entirely convinced of the certainty of this prediction.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps an assumption for the recent posts is the fact that uploads will
<BR>
not in fact be running loose, that they would not be completely self-
<BR>
modifiable.  A corporation would be, then, essentially enslaving or
<BR>
otherwise depriving the upload; without consciousness or self-enhancement
<BR>
tools he could be, depending on how the mind actually works, a perfect
<BR>
slave.  First, it would have to be pretty secret.  Second, possessing
<BR>
multiple copies of something does not necessarily increase productivity
<BR>
proportionally.  Third, such a firm---with real-life uploads festering in
<BR>
its corporate prison---may not be the only one with access to the
<BR>
technology.  There could be other firms which will birth unfettered
<BR>
uploads.  It really only takes one.  Fourth, we will have to face
<BR>
opposition to uploads long before one organization makes one in its
<BR>
basement.  I'm sure that there are other concerns.
<BR>
<P>The thread has contained some comments relevant to these points but has not
<BR>
made the parameters of this speculation as flexible as necessary.
