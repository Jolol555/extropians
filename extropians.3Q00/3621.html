<P><EM>&gt;Will increased life span and/or immortality make old age attractive in new 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ways?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, definitely.  The term old age will change and new phrasing such as
<BR>
young-old, which is already in use, will soon prop up along with many other
<BR>
words and terms to describe those who enjoy increased life span and
<BR>
youthfulness.  But this is of course just a beginning.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For now, we are mostly interested in youth. A plain person can be famous
</EM><BR>
as a 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;beauty (see any of the teen idols today) if they are just young enough.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Women (including myself) seem far more preoccupied with &quot;looking&quot; young than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;men, at this time. Especially good looking ones. For youth is beauty.
</EM><BR>
<P>The concept of youth can be a bit misleading because youthfulness is indeed
<BR>
desirous, but youth as in looking young is not necessarily alluring.  I do
<BR>
not find young looking males particularly attractive or sexual, but find
<BR>
the deeper age much more alluring and beautiful -- meaning I am physically
<BR>
and emotionally attracted to a bloom than a blossom.  Same for females.  
<BR>
<P>(snip)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Of course not everyone, for many age gracefully and/or resist aging in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sensible ways, taking care of themsleves and being lovely emotionally well 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;balanced people. Beauty is always inside anyway. The outside is merely a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reflection, is it not?
</EM><BR>
<P>In a world of depth, but not always.  Although I prefer to blend the inner
<BR>
and outer beauty, the visual image and what catches the eye is the physical
<BR>
appearance, and I rather enjoy admiring beauty on many animals.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With the advent of longevity, perhaps youth (the power of longevity) will go 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out of fashion. Perhaps enduring and mastering a long passing of time will
</EM><BR>
be 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;seen as beauty, and the evidence of time - not hormone loss - but character, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wisdom, grace, knowledge and poise- will give one &quot;beauty&quot;...
</EM><BR>
<P>When individuals can pick and choose what we want to look like, striving
<BR>
for beauty will no longer be such a major preoccupation because physical or
<BR>
non-biologically physical beauty can be easily achieved.  When it is no
<BR>
longer such a preoccupation, other elements of an individual or entity will
<BR>
take precedence.  I find it similar to achieving a goal.  Once the goal is
<BR>
achieved, I look for the next goal.  I don't think it is a small matter or
<BR>
a wasteful preoccupation to want to be youthful, vigorous and attractive
<BR>
just as I don't think it is a needless preoccupation to want to be
<BR>
intelligent, creative, generous, kind and successful.  More people
<BR>
preoccupy their time trying to make money than trying to be beautiful. 
<BR>
<P>I don't think youthfulness will become passe or beauty out of vogue, just
<BR>
as I don't think we have any idea now what will become future cultural
<BR>
preferences other than making projections based on potential evolutionary
<BR>
trends.  One thing I do know is that most people tend to appreciate (with
<BR>
awe) a beautiful sunset.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;20th centurions may become highly sought after individuals: ancient, rare,
</EM><BR>
complex and exotic, compared to the new crops of baby immortals who never
<BR>
had to face dying, never knew what it was like.
<BR>
<P>Relics of the past are unique.  A wonderful book to read which covers some
<BR>
relics of the past is _An Underground Education_ by Richard Zacks.  I'll
<BR>
confess, I don't find the relics of some of the past very exotic - but
<BR>
horribly stricken by the constraints and unhealthy environments in which
<BR>
they resided.  
<BR>
<P>My mother, in her mid-80s, is beautiful because she is both lovely and
<BR>
generous.   I don't, however, look at her with rose-colored glasses.  Her
<BR>
mind causes her to be irritable and impatient, but I know that she cannot
<BR>
help what goes on in her mind.  She is a young-old person who is frustrated
<BR>
that she cannot produce ideas as she once did or to be as mentally
<BR>
adventurous.  I don't find this aspect of her beautiful, but very sad that
<BR>
she, presently, cannot grow beyond her mental limitations.  What I do
<BR>
appreciate enormously is that she has survived much.
