<P>
Robin,
<BR>
<P>I read your paper &quot;Dreams of Autarky&quot;, and found the arguments quite
<BR>
plausible.  I've felt similar reactions to some of these proposals and
<BR>
expectations, but not noticed the common features.  I think I'm agreeing with
<BR>
you when I say that it seems to be due to an unfamiliarity with the economic
<BR>
point of view in many otherwise farsighted people.  
<BR>
<P>One point you've made before that I thought was underemphasized as a part of
<BR>
this constellation of effects is the expectation among the proponents of these
<BR>
autarkies that someone will achieve the breakthrough far in advance on one of
<BR>
these fronts.  Not only are we interdependent for our economy, we're also
<BR>
interdependent for inventions and discovery.  Many of the worries (of Bill 
<BR>
Joy, as well as people like Eliezer) are that someone will get far enough 
<BR>
ahead to take over before everyone else catches up.
<BR>
<P><P>Your inclusion of &quot;Space Colonies Soon&quot; was a sobering thought, though I have
<BR>
to admit the argument is sound.  I've only recently started to get somewhat
<BR>
excited by the possibilities of (humanity) starting to get off the planet
<BR>
soon.  I guess I'll refocus on more exploitation of near-space &quot;soon&quot; rather
<BR>
than expecting extensive trips, or actual colonization.  Are there other
<BR>
development paths that occur to you which could lead to increasing our
<BR>
commerce with space?  Starting from here, even intensive use of zero-g
<BR>
orbits for manufacturing seems a good ways away, but once that starts, much 
<BR>
more travel to orbit begins to seem plausible, which is at least a base from
<BR>
which to hope more trade seems plausible.
<BR>
<P><P><P>I also had a reaction to your discussion of Crypto Credentials, though this is
<BR>
probably more of a tangent.  I haven't ever believed that Chaumian blind
<BR>
credentials were plausible in any near future.  I have hoped we could find
<BR>
more conventional ways to separate information about different facets of our
<BR>
lives.  Right now, the US government promotes tighter integration of all these
<BR>
facets by ensuring everyone has a common identifier (SSN) and providing
<BR>
justification in many sectors (employment; health care; finance, which is
<BR>
connected to purchasing most large-ticket items) for people to re-use the same
<BR>
ID. Given current restrictions on further governmental use of the SSN, they've
<BR>
been pushing for other forms of universal ID like standardized driver's
<BR>
licenses that could be broadly used throughout the government.  If different 
<BR>
facets of our lives weren't artificially made more accessible behind 
<BR>
consumer's backs, they could do a better job of preventing employers from 
<BR>
finding out irrelevant facts, or at least know when it's happening so social 
<BR>
pressure could effect the outcomes.
<BR>
<P>Chris
