<P><EM> &gt; We are still a movement that hides in the basement, we' re not getting out 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in the public forums, after so much time. Actually the trend does seem to me 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to go backwards. Rereading old issues of Extropy magazine was interesting, 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; but frightening, the discourse was on a higher, more informed, level.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Maybe it's just me, but it seems a few years ago the list discussion
<BR>
*was* at a higher level.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; In my last days in the Swedish Transhumanist Association I often found 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; myself writing e-mail about 30 or 40K long explaining basically &quot;Economics 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 101&quot; to others, constantly trying to re- invent the wheel to keep the 
</EM><BR>
<P>My hunch is that economics will be eventually reinvented, becoming
<BR>
essentially a formal physical/information theory. There's nothing
<BR>
basic about the economy. Everyone who thinks the field is mature is
<BR>
imho totally mistaken. Of course, we're not exactly throwing around
<BR>
equations and results from numerical models, when discussion markets &amp;
<BR>
Co. I frankly admit to not knowing what the best system is, hence I
<BR>
usually keep my trap shut when such high-falutin' stuff is being
<BR>
discussed.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; My experience says that one of the problems are that the transhumanist 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; movement established itself, from the beginning, as an activist movement. 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Activism is important, but it is a later stage in the development of a 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; political movement. Looking on how other movements established themselves 
</EM><BR>
<P>Transhumanism is based on science and technology, right?. This is the
<BR>
true cutting edge, and there all the work is being done. Everything
<BR>
else is, well, words and memes. See nuthin' wrong with that
<BR>
either. However, I'm getting a bit tired of this activism thing, at
<BR>
least in science goals are clearer, and there is a clear metric of
<BR>
progress. Otherwise one might wind up looking a bit like these
<BR>
stick-dry Objectivist Institute dudes, or the Sceptics Society. You
<BR>
know. They're there, but they're not quite there.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; [mucho interesting ruminations snipped]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; A change of strategy is at hand, I think.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Like our opponents say, this is World War IV. And if we don't understand 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; this and form ourselves into a better fighting force they will win, 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; unopposed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see the instrumentality of the continued us-them
<BR>
polarization. First of all, this could really eventually lead to
<BR>
radicalization, including violence on either or both sides, which
<BR>
would seem monumentally dumb. Even our opponents can't help
<BR>
contributing to the cosa nostra by not dropping out of the
<BR>
economics/rat race. Why don't you give them a break? No equivalent of
<BR>
neoludd PETA is going to pump you full of lead in the parking lot in
<BR>
front of your house yet, and I see no diabolical mad scientist world
<BR>
domination plans to be conducted in remote mountaintop castle
<BR>
laboratories being hatched here, so why can't we all get along. Some
<BR>
folks are concerned about electrosmog, or genetically engineered food,
<BR>
so what. They might not be scientifically schooled, and thus their
<BR>
opposition lacking rigeur, but their concerns are valid. Instead of
<BR>
&quot;you ludd, no good&quot;, how about some gentle education? For instance, we
<BR>
do know about the rodent long-term mememory problems when irradiated
<BR>
with cell-phone-type EM, and we do know that humankind tends to
<BR>
generate pests, by introducing organisms from remote areas of the
<BR>
globe with slightly differing fitness from those occupying a given
<BR>
niche, so that blanket assertions that release of genetically modified
<BR>
organisms into the environment could not lead to a yet another
<BR>
irritating man-made pest could be a bit premature? Not to speak about
<BR>
seed-total herbicide packages, leading to monopolization of markets,
<BR>
reducing ecological and economical diversity.
