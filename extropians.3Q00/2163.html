<P><EM>&gt; Thirty year old technology, and still the fastest passenger aircraft in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the sky.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt;  Sigh...
</EM><BR>
<P>Being an unreconstructed aerospace nut (and spending way too much time on 
<BR>
airplanes), I've followed the Concorde crash story with morbid fascination.  
<BR>
Some random observations:
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  The Concorde stands for the proposition (among others) that you &quot;can't 
<BR>
push the river&quot;.  Despite 35 years of effort by France and the UK, BA and 
<BR>
AirFrance haven't been able to make their SST really pay.  BA says it makes 
<BR>
an operating profit on their birds, but only if you do the accounting such 
<BR>
that you consider that the company received the airplanes as a GIFT from the 
<BR>
British government.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt; Despite having suffered through a transatlantic flight more times than I 
<BR>
can now count, I can't make myself believe that an SST with current 
<BR>
technology makes sense.  It seems to me that the disruption of one's schedule 
<BR>
from crossing 6 or 8 time zones in 3 or 4 hours is just as great as doing it 
<BR>
in 9 or 10 hours.  Heck, just going back and forth between the US Middle and 
<BR>
Left Coasts is enough to kill the better part of two whole days for me.  With 
<BR>
the ability to keep a laptop computer running throughout the usable portion 
<BR>
of the transatlantic flight now, I've come to actually be able to make 
<BR>
productive use of the trip if I want or need to.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt; By the time technology develops to the point that a ticket for an SST ride 
<BR>
is cost effective for the business traveler, telepresence will have made such 
<BR>
trips decreasingly useful.  This is already happening.  Those kinds of 
<BR>
business activities that can't seem to be replaced by telepresence tend to 
<BR>
not be the kind that are the most time-sensitive in the vast majority of 
<BR>
cases.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt; Concorde is a testimony to the fact that highly skilled and motivated 
<BR>
people can make an &quot;irrational&quot; technology work pretty darned well long past 
<BR>
the point where it would make sense to throw in the towel and let it die a 
<BR>
natural death.  This is obviously a function of government subsidy and 
<BR>
institutional inertia insulated from market pressures, a lesson to which 
<BR>
advocates of swift technological progress should pay close attention.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt; I understand why the engines have to be in closed nacelles tucked in 
<BR>
tightly to the body and wing, but why not on TOP of the wing, where debris 
<BR>
from an exploding tire wouldn't be a problem?
