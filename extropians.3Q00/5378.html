<EM>&gt;&gt; The reason for an armed populace is very, very fundamental:

<EM>&gt; &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Do you actually view it to be self-evident that we have a creator, and
</EM><BR>
that he (sorry, &quot;He&quot;) endowed us with rights? I not only don't think
<BR>
it is self-evident, but I don't even think it is at all likely. Is this
<BR>
the foundation for why you believe we should have an armed populace?

<P>No, I do not &quot;believe&quot; in a god(s). No, this is not the reason for an
<BR>
armed population. The reason is to keep goverment (and private
<BR>
hoodlums) in check, to keep the would-be rulers constantly in fear
<BR>
of the citizenry. This is the fundamental check and balance on
<BR>
&quot;political power&quot;, which, as Mao Tse-tung notes, &quot;grows out of
<BR>
the barrel of a gun&quot; [1].
<BR>
<P>Taking a single point out of context is not a very effective means
<BR>
of making a cogent argument. It can distract a reader from the essential
<BR>
theory, and lead one down irrelevant lines of inquiry. The &quot;founding
<BR>
fathers&quot;, many of whom were deists [2], with a few christians, were
<BR>
writing for their time, as is quite evident in the remainder of this particular
<BR>
document.

[2] deism: a rationalistic movement of the 17th and 18th centuries whose adherents
<BR>
generally subscribed to a natural religion based on human reason and morality,

on the belief in one God who after creating the world and the laws governing it
<BR>
refrained from interfering with the operation of those laws, and on the rejection
<BR>
of every kind of supernatural intervention in human affairs.
