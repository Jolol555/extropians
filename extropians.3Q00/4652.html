Here's the challenge; say something useful about the purpose of the CBD, and
<BR>
put your two cents in on Spike's data storage problem, in the same message.
<BR>
Feel free to add more parallel topics, and raise the stakes...

<EM>&gt; They steal each other's employees.
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess so. But then, the workers have to put up with crappy conditions
<BR>
(commuting, parking, or expensive living). I guess it's desirable; a city
<BR>
gives you lots of job opportunity in a confined area. In turn, a city gives
<BR>
you lots of potential employees in a confined area.
<BR>
<P>Funny thing is, if you spread it all out a bit, commutes would probably take
<BR>
just as long in the worst cases (longer distances, but faster travel because
<BR>
of emptier roads, so less agravation), no parking hassles (and costs),
<BR>
cheaper housing near work (which cancels out the commute quite often). I
<BR>
just can't really grasp the sense of the mega high density city as a place
<BR>
to put a knowledge-based business. But then, I haven't worked in the city
<BR>
for a long time now; can't remember what those elusive benefits are.
<BR>
<P>I can understand it if you live in Singapore, for instance, or Macau, but I
<BR>
don't get it in a country like Australia, or the US for that matter. There's
<BR>
space. The cars are fast; build a few more highways.
<BR>
<P>Personally I love a dense city; they're interesting places to be in,
<BR>
stimulating. But they are really irritating if you have to fight your way
<BR>
through them every day.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; New topic please: those of you who use databases, please advise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me here.  For prime number research I have been using microsloth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excel for database tasks, but it only holds 65535 lines per sheet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it gets overwhelmed if you start using multiple sheets with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the entire 65k-lines.  I need a means of storing info on about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 300,000 primes, along with about 8-10 other pieces of info about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each one.  How now?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's the MS Party line:
<BR>
<P>You could use MS Access to cope with data of this size; it'll groan a
<BR>
little, but it'll do the job just fine. Make sure you've got a bit of spare
<BR>
disk space, and put an index on whatever you are going to search by; this
<BR>
may prevent you considering mass homicide later on. Any version of Access
<BR>
except versions 1 or 95 will do.
<BR>
<P>Or, you could always pop it in a table in Word, if you are feeling reckless.
<BR>
I don't know how you'd ever get it out again, though.
