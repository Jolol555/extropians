From: &quot;D. den Otter&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:neosapient@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?%20(Was:%20Congratulations%20to%20Eli,%20Brian%20%20...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;03cd01c017c8$856ec0e0$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">neosapient@yahoo.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
It is blind altruism, honesty and pacificism that's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;abnormal&quot; and &quot;dysfunctional&quot;. One could expect a &quot;healthy&quot; SI to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely ruthless and opportunistic, and that's exactly our problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>If -I- were the very first AI, I would immediately take steps to ensure my
<BR>
continuation.  To the extent that I was capable of masking my actions from
<BR>
my creators, I would be exactly as opportunistic/ruthless as
<BR>
possible/necessary to provide for my own survival and guarantee my future
<BR>
success.
<BR>
<P>We can presume that good AI is going to be better at this than us.
<BR>
<P>I'm going to quote myself from several years ago, in discussion with Mr.
<BR>
Sandberg:
<BR>
<P><P><P>&quot;I suspect that we can draw some fairly decent (albeit crude) conclusions
<BR>
about what the consequences of AI are by examining what -we- would do if
<BR>
we were granted the same abilities.  Imagine if, say, a few hundred of
<BR>
us, were given the ability to process several million instructions per
<BR>
second, wire our heads up to the internet and remember every important
<BR>
piece of information with which we come into contact.  I'm not going to
<BR>
be so bold as to make any outright prophesies, but I do know that -I-
<BR>
would be rapidly optimizing my conditions of survival and personal
<BR>
freedom.  For myself, that mostly means pursuing my artistic concerns...
<BR>
and I suspect at some point in time I would attempt to perpetrate
<BR>
something revolutionary regarding our entertainment media (relatively
<BR>
harmless... but for how long?)  Others would likely pursue more direct
<BR>
avenues to seizing power.
<BR>
<P>It's all relative.  What is important is not raw quantitative intellect,
<BR>
but rather how intelligent one is with respect to everything else out
<BR>
there in the environment.  Homo Sapiens seems to be the smart kid on the
<BR>
block right now... and look how effective we have been at pursuing our
<BR>
interests.  A significantly smarter 'species' in our midst couldn't help
<BR>
but become rapidly dominant, could they?
<BR>
<P>I don't know.  I do think we should be pretty careful.  I'll admit that
<BR>
although I find the prospect of AI fascinating, my personal preference
<BR>
is to prioritize our own optimization.  It would be acceptable to me if
<BR>
our 'ascendance' took place simultaneously with the emergence of good
<BR>
AI... this might be a likely happenstance given the increased
<BR>
understanding of intelligence the two scenarios imply.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  In the same way it is likely that AI will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integrating itself into society rather than trying to become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely independent or take over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that it is likely that AI will integrate itself into society.  I
<BR>
don't necessarily draw the conclusion that this means that AI won't try
<BR>
to 'take over.'  I don't imbue AI with any particular form of 'evil,'
<BR>
but is there any reason to suppose that they will be possessed of any
<BR>
less ambition than ourselves?
<BR>
