<EM>&gt; Yes, of course. Note that the question is not why your calculator would want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be friendly. We're discussing why AI (of the human-competitive kind) would want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be friendly.
</EM><BR>
<P>In his 1997 book, Warwick says the less intelligent will not continue to
<BR>
be governed by the more intelligent. Others have said much the same. My
<BR>
reply is that intelligence is not motivation. I don't care how complex the
<BR>
machine is or whether it has mobility and can evolve or self-improve. What
<BR>
I care about is that it stays under control. That is a prime concern of
<BR>
all when it comes to AI. Human-competitive AI has no &quot;wants&quot; except for
<BR>
those capabilities it is given. Competing with humans is not a bad
<BR>
thing. That's why we invent all kinds of useful machines. So just spell
<BR>
out in terms we can all understand how the machines will surpass humans
<BR>
and how they will remain under control.

FWP
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Lay persons make themselves obsolete to the degree that they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fail to understand the significance of the Artilects, Mind Children, Robo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sapiens, and Spiritual Machines that do considerably more to enhance production
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than the most sophisticated calculators (or present day super computers for that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think it depends on how you approach the public. Nobody is threatened by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the $5 calculator. Everyone thinks it is a useful invention. However, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surpasses &quot;human equivalency&quot; with respect to arithmetic ability (which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sometimes in measuring IQ). I don't think the general public is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threatened by chess playing machines which surpass human equivalency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; although some human experts are. If you explain that &quot;transhuman&quot; AI as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it is called on the Singularity web site in such terms I expect most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people will see it as a positive contribution to socially beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inventions. Actually I think it is &quot;intellectual workers&quot; who will be most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threatened. The general public would want to know how you propose to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it under control if it has mobility and autonomy and genetic algorithms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find your comments reasonable and plausible. Hostile reactions to AI (as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagined by some contributors here) may be exaggerated. It could be that most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks will welcome AI as yet another labor-saving appliance -- which saves them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the trouble of thinking for themselves. It's been my experience that lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people dread exercising their brains even more than we dread exercising our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; muscles.
