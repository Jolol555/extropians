Emlyn talking to himself and someone else says:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;BTW, I didn't find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to disagree with in what you say, so I almost didn't respond. But, then, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; thought, should I only reinforce disagreements?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Good effort! That's probably a first for this list. Thanks!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think a lot of people post good things here, and are discouraged by being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignored. I've come to the conclusion that it usually means people agree with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you. I think I'll try to actually tell people ths more often.
</EM><BR>
<P>I concur.  Perhaps there should be a special subject heading--I suggest
<BR>
CONC (or perhaps AMEN!)--so that people can  support a given point of view
<BR>
even though they may not, at that moment, have anything to add.  It feels
<BR>
important to me to have a way to experience the wider range of responses to
<BR>
our inputs: &quot;Is anyone listening?  Does anyone care?  Does what I think
<BR>
have any value?&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
This medium, while it gives us marvelous new capabilities (cheap, quick,
<BR>
global reach), is also in many ways, perhaps most ways, still hugely
<BR>
impoverished.  Think about it; it's time-delayed written communication.
<BR>
(That's a significant step backward from the telephone, which gives you
<BR>
real time, full spectrum, human-to-human (audio) contact.)  Except for
<BR>
writing, we're all sitting in the silent darkness.  There's no &quot;See me,
<BR>
feel me, touch me, heal me.&quot;  (Though video and audio will no doubt come on
<BR>
stream soon.)  
<BR>
<P>Anyway I concur.  Discussion ought not, through inadvertance or the quirks
<BR>
of the medium, favor or overemphasize contention and negativity. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
