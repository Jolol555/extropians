<P><EM>    &gt;Turing believed that ESP could be a significant factor. It's quite curious that
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;this fact has been conveniently forgotten by so many of Turing's intellectual heirs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I think they're a little embarrassed that the great man could say something so apparently
<BR>
silly, but I don't think he was silly. Turing made no excuses, he knew that If ESP really did exist
<BR>
then all out current theories about intelligence and consciousness, including his own ideas,
<BR>
would be sent to the junk pile. Turing never liked ESP but his scientific integrity forced him to
<BR>
take it seriously because near the end of his life he really thought &quot;the statistical evidence,
<BR>
at least for telepathy, is overwhelming&quot;.
<BR>
<P>I doubt it one scientist in thousand would say that today. Turing's only mistake was to assume
<BR>
that the ESP &quot;experiments&quot; done in the 1940's and 50's that seemed so convincing to him were
<BR>
performed at the same high level as in other areas of science, and not incompetently performed
<BR>
by carnival barkers (they liked to call themselves &quot;researchers&quot;) who were either incredibly
<BR>
dumb, as naive as children, or just simple frauds.
<BR>
<P>I think it's been examined enough and it's time to move on to more productive things, but If you
<BR>
insist on studying ESP then you should go to the experts to help you set up the experimental
<BR>
protocol, find yourself a good stage magician.
