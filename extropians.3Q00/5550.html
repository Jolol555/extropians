From: &quot;Emlyn&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:emlyn@one.net.au?Subject=Re:%20Ye%20Are%20Gods&In-Reply-To=&lt;00ee01c025d2$7e9aadc0$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">emlyn@one.net.au</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As an aside, I think it's funny that transhumanism, which purports to
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt; about moving away from humanity, is actually more about what it is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamentally, to be human, than any other belief system/philosophy/vision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I can think of. Its about us merging more fully with our tools,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believing more strongly in our ability to reshape the universe, believing
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; ourselves rather than some unknowable greater force(s).
</EM><BR>
<P>Transhumanism is, after all, a form of humanism.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;By the way Emlyn, I've said as much before, but I really appreciate your
<BR>
approach.
<BR>
<P>I think it's important to not confuse honest humility with some sort of
<BR>
shivering kitten meekness.  For me, the reason for humility is
<BR>
ever-present-- it's in the vastness of the cosmos that enfolds us, it's in
<BR>
the mind boggling intricacy of reality, it's that little human, staring out
<BR>
at the universe, mouth open in a question.
<BR>
<P>Arrogance is often seen as a hallmark of intelligence, but in my experience
<BR>
those people who I deem to be most wise, most intelligent, most mentally
<BR>
nimble, who just seem to &quot;get it&quot;  are those who recognize how little we
<BR>
know, how small we are, and how magnificiently awesome the journey ahead is.
<BR>
It might seem contradictory, but for myself, Transhumanism is the
<BR>
recognition of that core truth mingled with the intense desire and belief
<BR>
that we can go so very much further.
