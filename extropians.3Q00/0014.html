<P><EM>&gt; !Zowwwie!! That's it! 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [ snip ]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Now, to be clear-- I'm not talking about socialism. I'm not talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  lobbying for higher taxes so we can buy third world farmers 500 MHz pentia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I'm talking about helping people in intelligent, elegant ways. In ways that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  will make them self-sufficient. Maybe even in ways that also enrich the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  helpers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Maybe we won't reach Jane Bluecollar in London or New York.  But this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  can be the foundation of an unlikely alliance between the resources and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  know how of the industrialized world educated elite and the poor people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of the third world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Specifics? Give me a break, this has just occurred to me. All I'm saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is, appropriate and affordable technology should be given more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  attention in our discussions. It's as important as AI, genomics, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  all that other good stuff. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  For the altruists out there-- we can help the needy in ways that few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  others have the expertise or imagination to do. I probably already had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  you from the second paragraph onward, so I'll stop preaching to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  choir. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  For the egoists out there-- a world of tech savvy, tech-heeled people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  will be more receptive to our ideas, especially if we're the ones who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  helped them get that way. The West is spoiled. You want to see a place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  where they love technology? Look to a place where they don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enough of it. Besides, this will also really confuse the liberals--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;What? Those Techno-Libertarians are *helping* people? How low can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they sink?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Alex, this is EXACTLY what I have in mind.  The core notion of transhumanism 
<BR>
- improving the human condition through the rational use of technology - 
<BR>
applies at EVERY level of the human experience.  I know not everyone here may 
<BR>
agree with me, but to me, working to design and implement better technology 
<BR>
and social systems in a third world village is just as extropian as working 
<BR>
to develop better neural-computer interfaces or developing new means of 
<BR>
living free in a California city saturated with the latest, greatest 
<BR>
information technology.  
<BR>
<P>The Greenstar system seems to me to be to what I'd like to see as a tech-hub 
<BR>
for underdeveloped communities what the Apple Iie or Commodore 64 was to the 
<BR>
wearable computers we're looking forward to in five years.  The folks who 
<BR>
have voiced criticisms of it here are right: It's too expensive, too 
<BR>
susceptible to hijacking by Bad Men With Guns and may even be supplying some 
<BR>
things the objects of the program don't need.  But my old Apple Iie didn't 
<BR>
offer a portal to a universe of ubiquitous computing, either, and, no matter 
<BR>
how much I used to swear at it, showed no inkling of voice recognition.  But 
<BR>
it was a clear and available step in the right direction and marked a 
<BR>
concrete milestone toward a goal with great merit, the real PERSONAL computer.
<BR>
<P>The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  Extropians take 
<BR>
first steps.
