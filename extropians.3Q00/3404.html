<EM>&gt; &gt;I'd put up $1000. Ok so that is $1100 so far, who else will contribute?

<EM>&gt; &gt;Let's make a stand here, and try to make an example of this criminal.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; If we can figure out a way to do something when we actually have this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person's name, there's $100 from me as well.  Let's not lynch, but do it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the right way.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which way is that? The consequences of the one I'm thinking of would
<BR>
require a lot more than $1200. ;)

<P>The thing with the perp is that he likely doesn't have two bits to his
<BR>
name, so going after him in court would be a waste, though if he truly
<BR>
is in school, then ruining his academic career would be nice and
<BR>
rewarding. Perhaps the perp is a former student of Max's? Perhaps
<BR>
someone who has been rather virulent about getting a bad grade from Max?

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
