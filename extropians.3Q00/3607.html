<P>Cabine fever is a reality, and submarine crews only do manage to
<BR>
function for a limited time, under military law. I'm sure if
<BR>
occasionally things run less well than expected, it is not exactly
<BR>
makes the news. Resident former army/navy people care to comment?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; That they are men-only probably doesn't explain *all* their success in this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; regard.

<P>I've heard the Russians have been routinely screening the crew for
<BR>
mutual compatibility for their long-term orbital missions (but they
<BR>
still do rotate the rest of the crew). Also, astronauts are typically
<BR>
kept occupied virtually 100% of the time -- not only because people
<BR>
LEO time is expensive.
<BR>
<P>As to privacy, we automatically assume small, cramped quarters when we
<BR>
talk about space. A near-closure lunar habitat must maintain a certain
<BR>
ecology footprint for each team member if it to be sustainable, and
<BR>
lunar material is cheap, as is oxygen produced from lunar rock. While
<BR>
I'm not sure whether pressurizing (so far hypothetical) sublunar lava
<BR>
tubes makes all that much sense, one could certainly imagine burying
<BR>
an airlock-connected gridwork of metal cylinders in lunar rock (both
<BR>
against radiation as a means to contain leaks) as habitat volume,
<BR>
being constantly expanded.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I find recent news about development of a small lunar
<BR>
rover melting regolith with a portable solar oven and sputtering
<BR>
photovoltaics cells upon resulting glass sheets heartening. This is
<BR>
still very far from being self-rep, but at least people are not blind
<BR>
to local resources, anymore. A lunar factory can churn out a lot of
<BR>
cubic meters of habitat before even first crew will move in.
