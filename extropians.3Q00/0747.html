<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Even species such as Desmognathus that live less than 15
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;&gt;years do not show signs of increased mortality with age (in fact, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;&gt;show decreased mortality after adulthood is reached).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;Do you have a cite for this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Finch's &quot;Longevity, Senescence, and the Genome&quot;, pag 219.

<P>I looked at all the data in Finch's book and I don't 
<BR>
think they properly address the presence of aging in
<BR>
ectothermic vertebrates.  The problem is that almost
<BR>
all the studies cited were field studies, and all 
<BR>
the organisms had very high rates of extrinsic 
<BR>
mortality.  If the extrinsic mortality is high, you
<BR>
can't detect aging even when it's there.  I note
<BR>
that in the one case where Finch provides data (the
<BR>
three turtle species) the curves show a distinct increase
<BR>
in mortality rate over time.  I expect it's not significant,
<BR>
but I wonder whether the authors used the maximum 
<BR>
likelihood methods you need to really sort these things
<BR>
out.  
<BR>
<P>My plan for investigating aging in temporary habitat
<BR>
shrimp is on hold for exactly this reason - I can't get
<BR>
the extrinsic mortality rate down to appropriately low
<BR>
levels.  When I looked at mortality curves from another
<BR>
student in the lab, I saw the same thing as with the turtles-
<BR>
an increase in mortality with time, although it was 
<BR>
significant in this case.
