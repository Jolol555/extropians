<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  because as far as I see it, the primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem with such system (socialism) is that the threat of force causes underlings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lie when feeding information up the line, and the pressure of propaganda needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mandate that the leadership lie about both the acheivements of the last five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years, and the goals of the next five years...
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you on this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is also the problem of perceptions of value. The market works because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allows parties to negotiate a common sense of value. Any system that allows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties to freely negotiate common perceptions of value is, by definition, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free market system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Also true as long as *individuals* remain the focus of such transactions.  But what
<BR>
I see happening are large numbers of individuals being controlled by small numbers
<BR>
through the traditional hierarchy of corporations.  If this is not the case, then
<BR>
why is it that less than 5% of any company dictates and controls policy while the
<BR>
other 95% have to *obey* or get fired.
<BR>
<P>i.e.  Corporation = Dictatorship.  I challenge anyone to say otherwise.  Sure I know
<BR>
there are a *few* exceptions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is this in fact the optimum system? As far as the individuals are concerned,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on their self interest, yes (except for those individuals who think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negotiation = getting screwed). As far as the long term best interest of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals, this is debatable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again I disagree with this.  I want to use Napster and so does another 25 million
<BR>
people.  Sorry, but those running the corporations and in this case we are talking
<BR>
about less than 1000 people have decided that we can not.  The way I see it, if law
<BR>
is imposed on a majority by a minority as in the case of Napster, then you have
<BR>
nothing less than a Corporate Dictatorship using the government as its strong-arm.
<BR>
Where is the individual transaction in this case?  From where I'm sitting, they
<BR>
could give a damn about the individual, only profits matter now.
