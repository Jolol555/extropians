<P><EM>&gt; Paul, please tell me how I can make this true for my clients.  Many (but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all) of my clients are these &quot;big corporations&quot; you've been talking about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My client in the trial I'm starting on Wednesday would certainly qualify.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suppose I've been wasting all the work I've done over this holdiay weekend,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since our victory is assured .
</EM><BR>
<P>Assured?  Never once said it was assured.  However, when you take into account all
<BR>
case law throughout the 20th century, I'd be very surprised to learn that the
<BR>
larger and more well financed legal team is not the victor in the majority of
<BR>
cases - *especially if the corporation is the plaintiff.*   The most obvious
<BR>
exceptions are ones involving corporations as defendants in liability cases.  In
<BR>
those cases the potential payoff to the plaintiff lawyers could be substantial,
<BR>
thereby increasing the chances of the little guy gaining the support of an equally
<BR>
sizable legal team.   Sounds to me like you are representing the corporation as a
<BR>
defendant in this case, yes?
<BR>
<P>I don't know the facts of your particular case, but I do wish you the best of luck
<BR>
with your trial either way Greg. :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; FYI, the plaintiffs in this case haven't paid a dime for the two top-ranked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lawyers who have been busting their butts to win this case for months.  Not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dime.  Their payday only comes with a plaintiff's verdict, and then after an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appeal (which I guarantee they'll have to go through, if we don't like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outcome at trial).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what am I missing?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, so your case does involves corporate liability?  Then what your missing is
<BR>
when the tables are turned, and the corporation is the plaintiff.  What chances
<BR>
does the little guy have then?  Unless that person is also an 800lb gorilla, or
<BR>
the lawsuit is clearly frivolous, that little guy will have no choice but to fold
<BR>
in fear of an expensive lawsuit they cannot afford, or get lucky enough to gain
<BR>
the support of an expensive legal team due to any potential landmark precedents it
<BR>
might set.  The most recent and poignant case is Eric Corley of 2600 who is
<BR>
getting the support of the EFF because of its landmark implications on the First
<BR>
Amendment.  I can tell you right now, if it wasn't for the support of the EFF,
<BR>
Eric Corley would be probably br history regardless of the intrinsic justice in
<BR>
the case.  And that is the injustice of the system - those who can't afford the
<BR>
money for a defense against a corporate plaintiff have little chance at all.
<BR>
<P>Overwhelmingly when an individual citizen or smaller organization or company
<BR>
receives a cease and desist letter, they are going to comply regardless of what
<BR>
might be legal or just, simply because they cannot afford emotionally or
<BR>
financially the alternative.  So where is the justice in that?
