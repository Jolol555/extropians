<P><EM>&gt; Is that Al2O3 correct? I didn't know that sapphire whiskers and

<EM>&gt; Aluminum oxide was the same material. Cool.
</EM><BR>
<P>Same elements, but not the same molecular structure.  Fortunately
<BR>
we can make sapphire in bulk.  The THAAD missile seeker window
<BR>
is a single crystal sapphire.  The recent order of 1100 of those
<BR>
windows has caused the price of manufactured sapphire to drop
<BR>
noticeably.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Al2O3 is the material that is released from the solid rocket motor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firings when pushing a satellite into higher orbits.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right but the use of solid motors is being strongly discouraged for
<BR>
use in orbital transfer maneuvers, for the resulting slag may damage
<BR>
existing satellites.  Perhaps Doug knows the last time such a thing
<BR>
was used.  I dont know of a solid being used recently.  The notion
<BR>
that solids deposit materials that could later be used for other
<BR>
purposes
<BR>
has never occurred to me.  Amara!  Run to the patent office and
<BR>
claim all orbiting slag.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This material
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is among the most common debris material in orbit around the earth.
</EM><BR>
<P>So this material has a natural source?  I guess I could see why that
<BR>
would be, for whatever caused the asteroid belt (planetary
<BR>
collision) would leave yottagrams of dust, which would likely be
<BR>
aluminum oxide.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here is a picture of an aluminum oxide sphere attached to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; micrometeroid (cosmic dust) particle:

<P>Cool thanks!  Im guessing the spherical one is the Al2O3,
<BR>
resulting from a solid rocket motor burn in orbit.  spike
