In re same, a book few years ago &quot;Running Critical&quot;
<BR>
about ADM H. Rickover and Electric Boat, there was
<BR>
a submarine under construction (in 1980)  that a 'young' 
<BR>
inspector 'screwed herself' around and found some welds
<BR>
NOT done in the outer hull. She and the Navy rejected the 
<BR>
work and through the great &quot;Management&quot; of the govt
<BR>
it seems the Navy was self insured so they (WE) had
<BR>
to foot the bill for the repairs and then had to 'settle'
<BR>
with EB for the delays etc as EB was going to sue
<BR>
the Insurer for their own shoddy work.....It goes on
<BR>
and on....Anybody wants a Good, Scary read try this
<BR>
one it is called &quot;RUNNING CRITICAL&quot; by Patrick
<BR>
Tyler and is probably going to take some doing to
<BR>
find it. (copyright 1986--ISBN 0-06--15377-6)
<BR>
It is just another example of how OUR GOVT treats
<BR>
us &quot;fools and idiots&quot; that do their bidding......
<BR>
Disgraceful.

<P>In my Last concerning book &quot;Running Critical&quot;
<BR>
it is about General Dynamics of which
<BR>
&quot;Electric Boat&quot; was a part of General Dynamics

<P>Hi, There is another side to the story of expensive hammers, toilet seats,
<BR>
coffee urns stc.  At one time congress passed a law mandating that
<BR>
replacement spares and tools should be purchased from the systems primary
<BR>
contractor when possible.  The wording was such that virtually forced the
<BR>
procurement people to buy from primary contractor.  They knew this and when
<BR>
a procurement officer would find a chepaer supplier would wave copies of
<BR>
the law under his nose.  I was told this while assigned as a technical
<BR>
representative to a contracting officer, (trco).  The same congress people
<BR>
who passed the law vilified the services when the complied with it. 
<BR>
Probably explained why their so many closed door hearings.  Jim S.

<P>Hey, the government contracting officers can win one sometimes.
<BR>
<P>I was in Khartoum, with USAID, in '87-'89, when we got a cable from 
<BR>
USAID/Washington saying don't buy ANYTHING made by GE, from light bulbs to 
<BR>
generators to airplane engines.  Seems like a Navy contracting officer was 
<BR>
unhappy with GE up at the submarine construction yards and couldn't come to 
<BR>
an agreement with them.  So, he suspended them from government contracting, 
<BR>
the effect of which was spread throughout the entire USG, not just the Navy.
<BR>
<P>Took about a week for GE to come to agreement on the dispute, and get back 
<BR>
to selling light bulbs in such out of the way places as Khartoum.
<BR>
<P>And, FYI, there's 27 copies of &quot;Running Critical&quot; available via ABE BOOKs 
<BR>
