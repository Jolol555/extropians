Looking up statistics on the chance of dying due to murder (0.9%) I
<BR>
found <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/releases/99facts/99sheets/97mortal.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/releases/99facts/99sheets/97mortal.htm</A>
<BR>
(which links to the PDF file with the actual report).
<BR>
<P>Surprisingly to me, age-adjusted death rates have declined about 20%
<BR>
since 1980.  The age-adjusted death rate is what the death rate would
<BR>
be if the age makeup of the population hadn't changed.  It factors out
<BR>
changes in the age demographics.
<BR>
<P>This means basically that you have a 20% less chance of dying in any
<BR>
given year today than you did in 1980.  That's a substantial increase,
<BR>
but it's been a pretty stable trend throughout this century.  Figure 1
<BR>
in the PDF file shows the trend since 1930.
<BR>
<P>The longevity statistics don't show such a dramatic improvement, I suppose
<BR>
because the chance of dying gets to be so high in the 70s and 80s that
<BR>
few people live beyond that, even if there is improvement in survival.
<BR>
<P>The details are shown in Figure 2.  For people in their 20s and 30s
<BR>
the death rate was actually climbing through the 80s and early 90s,
<BR>
probably due to AIDS.  Since the mid 90s it has fallen precipitously,
<BR>
with almost a 10% improvement just from 1996 to 1997.
<BR>
<P>If you want to live, it is a good idea to know how people die.  Some
<BR>
interesting statistics here.
<BR>
