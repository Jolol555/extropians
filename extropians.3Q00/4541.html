<EM> &gt; &gt;  &gt; Does truly superior intelligence require free will?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; Can you tell random from pseudorandom, without further knowledge about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; the generation source?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; This is an interesting question.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; My immediate temptation was to answer 'no.'
</EM><BR>
<P>Then the question about free will vs. determinism is meaningless in
<BR>
practical terms. Even if we're clockwork puppets deep down below, we
<BR>
can't use that fact to predict anything.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; However if a number generator is pseudo-random, then it applies is a logic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; or process by which it generates its numbers, which in theory I imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; might be detectable given a sufficiently large sample and sufficiently smart
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; pattern recognition software.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Well, a good pseudorandom number generator passes all statistical
<BR>
tests for randomness, and has only one pattern: it's periode, after
<BR>
which it begins repeat itself. This periode can be very long,
<BR>
i.e. much longer than the universe exists. Hence there is no
<BR>
measurement procedure allowing you to tell the output of one from
<BR>
another.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; One could assign a probability of being truly random to such a string of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; numbers.  (Which is all one could do in any case.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
