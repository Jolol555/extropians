<EM>&gt; we're on just one world all our eggs are in one basket. It doesn't even

<P>Along with the capacity for interstellar travel comes the possibility of
<BR>
interstellar weaponry.  Granted, it would be a lot easier to wipe out the
<BR>
local community, just like most muderously deranged individuals today
<BR>
target their family, fellow employees, or school.  But we are talking
<BR>
about insanity targetted against all of humanity.  Leaving earth won't
<BR>
help.  You would have to leave earth and become completely isolated from
<BR>
the rest of humanity.  Even that isn't a complete gurantee.
<BR>
<P>All in all, I think our best hope will be to bring about the singularity
<BR>
asap.  Human beings can't be trusted with the technologies we have for too
<BR>
much longer, as painful as that is for me to say.
