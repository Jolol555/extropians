Scientists discover key to invisibility

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;THE invisible man has come one step closer: scientists believe they have
<BR>
found a way to make flesh transparent for a few minutes at a time.
<BR>
By manipulating the way light passes through tissue, a team at the
<BR>
University of Texas at Austin has moved into what was once the realm of
<BR>
science fiction. The engineers say they can create a temporary &quot;window&quot; in
<BR>
tissue, allowing doctors to see up to five times deeper than at present over
<BR>
an area of up to one or two square inches.
<BR>
<P>Although the technique has not yet been tested on human skin, the engineers
<BR>
believe it could have applications in diagnosis; helping to reveal the
<BR>
extent of skin cancer, for example, and in treatment, by allowing a laser
<BR>
beam to be targeted on underlying tissue.
<BR>
<P>By injecting various substances, the team made small areas of rat or hamster
<BR>
skin nearly transparent for 20 minutes or more. Prof Ashley Welch, the lead
<BR>
investigator, said: &quot;We could see a blood vessel which had not been
<BR>
visible.&quot; Light does not usually penetrate skin because it is scattered,
<BR>
like a torch beam in fog.
<BR>
<P>Just as each water droplet in the fog scatters light, so small components of
<BR>
tissue also scatter light. To overcome this, his team used glycerol, a
<BR>
hygroscopic alcohol which pulls water out of tissue. The team has yet to
<BR>
look into the toxicity of the technique, which Prof Welch admitted was &quot;an
<BR>
important question&quot;.
