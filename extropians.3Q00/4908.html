<EM>&gt;&gt; As a member of Science Fiction Writers of America, I receive an email
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; newsletter.  I cannot directly quote from it, but there's a great deal of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; concern about Internet piracy of sf authors.  And with good reason.  Check 
</EM><BR>
<P>Additional news.  I first heard this through SFWA, but now it's public.
<BR>
<P>Harlan Ellison is one of the people whose works has been ripped off.
<BR>
You think they'd know not to screw with him.  He sued, and won a 
<BR>
judgment against the pirate.  However, his case against AOL for hosting 
<BR>
the files was dismissed, on grounds that the Digital Millennium Copyright
<BR>
Act protects ISPs from being held responsible for material accessed
<BR>
through their service. 
<BR>
<P>The new Harry Potter novel was reportedly on-line almost immediately
<BR>
after its release.
