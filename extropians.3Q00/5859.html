Greg Burch writes,
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; ...Lanier seems able to engage in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extended and fairly well-informed critique of transhumanism and extropianism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without using those words.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, he uses the term &quot;cybernetic totalism&quot; to refer to the
<BR>
Kurzweil-Moravec-deGaris-Drexler constellation of concepts which point to
<BR>
technological singularity. His manifesto is constrained by limiting itself to
<BR>
computers and software (his areas of expertise) -- with only a cursory glance at
<BR>
biotechnology and nanotechnology. He insufficiently analyzes (imo) the explosion
<BR>
of robotics laboratory work.
<BR>
<P>Who would not agree with him that software has failed to keep up with hardware
<BR>
development? No news there. But why doesn't he mention recent consilience of
<BR>
machines with humans (cyborg technology)?
<BR>
He jokes that robots of the future will stall when their computer operating
<BR>
systems crash. His manifesto seems to me a whining diatribe motivated by his own
<BR>
frustrating experience with computers.
<BR>
<P>But for anyone terrified of the future and its accelerating technologies,
<BR>
Lanier's essay might serve as a soothing tranquilizer. He seems to imply, &quot;Stop
<BR>
fretting folks. The future will fail, so we can all get back to our desks to
<BR>
work on those darned spreadsheets.&quot;

<P>&quot;Greetings, flesh-forms! I am Kevin Warwick of Reading University, cyborg
<BR>
freedom fighter from the 22nd century. My era is very different to yours -
<BR>
civilisation has been destroyed and humanity almost wiped out in the long wars
<BR>
against the giant, battery powered &quot;robot football team&quot;, and a sinister,
<BR>
skeletal &quot;electric cat&quot;. But some fragments of our ancient history remain,
<BR>
passed down from one cybernetically enhanced forearm to another - and, in those
<BR>
records, one name stands out above all others. That name is Kevin Warwick of
<BR>
Reading University - the most important human being who ever lived.&quot;
