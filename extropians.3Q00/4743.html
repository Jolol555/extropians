<P>
I'm a bi of a political thinker.  Not an incredibly adroit one, but I try to
<BR>
consider the issues.
<BR>
<P>This is goign to be an alarming thing to say, but I'll say it anyway.  None of
<BR>
the established American political parties as they currently manifest are 
<BR>
Extropian/transhuman in the least.  And part of this is why I have elected, 
<BR>
year after year, to abstain from giving even my tacit endorsement to any of the
<BR>
political candidates.  I do not vote, and will not vote until I can make a 
<BR>
conscionable choice.
<BR>
<P>We can all point at the shortcomings of the Republicans and the Democrats - 
<BR>
after all, they're the ones who've been in the forefront of political discourse
<BR>
for a century and a half.  But let's consider the alternatives:
<BR>
<P>Reform.  As a column in the Washington Post said most eloquently, &quot;It's good to
<BR>
see that Pat Robertson has finally attained his rightful place in the political
<BR>
sphere - an asterisk.&quot;  Reform never stood for anything in particular save a 
<BR>
bundle of ill-connected populist tripe that never managed to forment a coherent
<BR>
whole once the crackpot in chief resigned from day to day operations.
<BR>
<P>Libertarian.  I point anyon curious to a letter to the Los Angeles Times, 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000910/t000085051.html">http://www.latimes.com/news/comment/20000910/t000085051.html</A>.  I can sympathize
<BR>
with this poor man's feelings - why do I always feel like I'm walking into 
<BR>
a cult when I ee Libertarian political philosophy discussed?  I am unwilling to
<BR>
take the canonical, dogmatic approach that so many people do when approaching
<BR>
libertarianism.  I do NOT believe in the unalienable right to own automatic/
<BR>
assault/armor piercing/antitank/nuclear munitions - but nor do I believe that
<BR>
gun control as we practice it in the US is at all viable either.  Nor do I 
<BR>
believe in the philosophical distortions and gymnastics involved in such ideas
<BR>
as PPL and PPJ (Privately Produced law/Justice) - I have news for you.  
<BR>
Columbia has a similar system - it's called right wing paramilitary death 
<BR>
squads.  I have neither th faith in free markets nor the inherent goodness of
<BR>
human nature to trust libertarianism as it is described at its core.
<BR>
<P>Green.  My tirades on ecofundamentalism have already been seen here.  I am a 
<BR>
conservationist - I believe in biosphere preserves, inviolate lands set aside
<BR>
as both an insurance policy and a lockbox of our own biological diversity.  IU
<BR>
do NOT condone the demise of western civilization, the outlawing of space 
<BR>
launches (once a tenet of the Green Party in the 70s), nor so-called &quot;ethical 
<BR>
research&quot; limits.
<BR>
<P>There aren't really any other meaningful political parties, but I will not vote
<BR>
to align myself with religious or economic fundamentalists, luddites, hopeless
<BR>
egotists, isolationists, nor starry-eyed optimists who show no understanding 
<BR>
of human nature.
<BR>
<P>Give me &quot;None of the Above&quot; any day.
<BR>
<P>To bring this back on topic, are there any political systems that seem to 
<BR>
support a transhumanist worldview and progression, or does anyone else feel
<BR>
that transhumanism/extropianism should be an INTELLECTUAL pursuit, with a
<BR>
lobbying and social education function, rather than attempting to become a 
<BR>
political ideology?
<BR>
