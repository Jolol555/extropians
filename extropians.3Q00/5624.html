<EM>&gt; &gt;  Striving for excellence is excellent. Where's the room for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  spirituality/mysticism/religosity? Why do we need it? Does it benefit us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; add it? What price do we pay?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It depends utterly (of course) on what you mean by those terms.  One
<BR>
person's awe before the scope of nature and science is another person's
<BR>
spirituality.  They are not cleanly divisible.  Trying to do so is a
<BR>
largely a waste of time and shows a lack of understanding of the
<BR>
richness of huamn experience and motivation imho. 
<BR>
<P>Does it benefit us to rail against what might look less rational to you
<BR>
or I? Probably not.  It benefits us to point out rank superstition and
<BR>
the refusal to look at evidence.  It does not benefit us to rail against
<BR>
being overcome by feelings of awe and feeling as if there is a Presence
<BR>
within our experience that we cannot quite grasp.  I would point out
<BR>
that many of the greatest scientists were not so dismissive of that.  
<BR>
<P>What is being added?  For many of us these feelings and experiences are
<BR>
the given, not something added.  For those with an active mind who are
<BR>
not lazy it requires a lot of seeking to understand just what it is,
<BR>
what it means, what it is good for and so on.  It does not lead
<BR>
automatically into any superstitious and out-moded or anti-science
<BR>
religious viewpoint although many religious try quite hard to own this
<BR>
space and to coopt people who are touched by these things.
<BR>
<P>One place where you might need something very akin to
<BR>
spirituality/mysticism/religion  is in devising a vision, a collective
<BR>
understanding and motivation, of where we wish to go with all our
<BR>
expanded powers to change and do.  Science and materialism generally
<BR>
have not had much to say about ethics or such general goals and
<BR>
over-arching concerns.  Without a vision the people perish.
