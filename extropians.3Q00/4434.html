<P><EM>&gt; Witness the software industry: certainly not something evolving along
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a straight log plot. (Nor does hardware industry, look at the growth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of nonlocal memory bandwidth). The only currently visible pathway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; towards robust AI is stealing from biology, reproducing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development of the brain in machina, or breeding a something exploting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a given hardware architecture optimally by evolutionary algorithms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, using bio-tech and genetic programming to breed artificial intelligent life
<BR>
sounds very promising. No matter how the job gets done, just do it. The sooner
<BR>
the better. Incidentally, I don't actually trust artificially amplified
<BR>
intelligence, whether biologically based or purely inorganic. But from what I've
<BR>
seen of Homo sapiens sapiens, I trust the humans even less.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; would evolve with higher and higher IQs. Those intelligent agents (IAs)
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; display unfriendly tendencies could simply be terminated. This is a
</EM><BR>
tremendous
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Undecidedability, dude. 2) Containment. If the thing is useful, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is dangerous. If it is useful, and can be built and/or reverse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineered easily enough it will be used. If it will be used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large enough numbers for a long enough time, the thing either will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; express its hidden malignant tendency or mutate into a potentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dangerous shape. There is zilch you can do about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>That description sounds a lot like my neighbor's kids. People are unpredictable,
<BR>
and they don't seem to care how much they overpopulate the Earth. Very dangerous
<BR>
indeed. As a neutral observer (one that will eventually die anyway, no matter
<BR>
what form of life inherits the universe), I guess I'd just as soon die at the
<BR>
hands of a greater-than-human-intelligence robot than die at the hands of some
<BR>
retarded human religious warrior. No wait! That's not a guess, it's more like a
<BR>
definite preference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; AIs are very useful, since actual human intellects are scarce,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expensive and slow to produce, and evolutionary algorithms are by far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the simplest way to produce robust, open-ended intelligence. Look into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mirror.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, there he is: an open-ended intelligence produced by evolutionary algorithms
<BR>
staring back at me from the mirror. Can I trust this Homo sapiens sapiens more
<BR>
or less than I'd trust one replicated from synthetic evolution? Frankly, it's a
<BR>
toss-up.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [insert derisive laughter here]
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, let me rephrase that: The advantage of working with Mind Children is that
<BR>
(unlike biological children) you can preclude unfriendlies by terminating any of
<BR>
them that laugh derisively, and replicating those that work hard at gaining your
<BR>
favor. &lt;grin&gt;

<P>&quot;I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed,
<BR>
de-briefed, or numbered!&quot;  --Number 6
