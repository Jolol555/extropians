<P>I don't know. A search on 'Electric Communities' turned up more than I could
<BR>
wade through. There's lots of stuff out there: graphical muds, immersive 3D
<BR>
shared worlds, flexible, highly collaborative text based systems, etc. It's a
<BR>
very exciting, very fast growing area. Maybe someone who's spent more time
<BR>
looking into this stuff could suggest some interesting starting points.
