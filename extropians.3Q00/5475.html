<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE SEPTEMBER 22 2000
<BR>
<P><P>IN THIS ISSUE, SEPTEMBER 22 2000:  LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:
<BR>
Calcium supplements safe; PROTOCOL:  Osteoporosis; FEATURED PRODUCTS OF
<BR>
THE WEEK:  Bone Assure, Calcium Citrate; BOOK:  Drug-Induced Nutrient

<BR>
<P><P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Calcium supplements safe
<BR>
<P>(Life Extension Update Exclusive is a weekly feature of Life Extension
<BR>
Update ezine that you won't find on our website or in our print magazine.)
<BR>
<P>Supplement consumers may have been alarmed this week by the news media's
<BR>
pronouncement that some calcium supplements contain lead.  This news was
<BR>
published in the respected Journal of the American Medical Association
<BR>
(JAMA), and was taken up by popular news media.  Lead poisoning, although
<BR>
much rarer now than it was several decades ago, causes learning and
<BR>
behavioural difficulties in children and can lead to kidney and brain
<BR>
damage, cardiovascular disease, anemia and hypertension in adults.  Six
<BR>
micrograms per day is considered the maximum safe intake limit.
<BR>
<P>The JAMA article reported the results of the examination of twenty-one
<BR>
calcium calcium carbonate formulas, including seven derived from natural
<BR>
sources such as oyster shell.  In the natural source calcium, four of the
<BR>
seven tested were found to have 1-2 mcgs lead per 1500 mg calcium, which
<BR>
is the dose of calcium recommended for women over thirty-five to prevent
<BR>
osteoporosis.  Of the fourteen non-natural, or refined sources, four had
<BR>
up to 3 mcg per 1500 mg calcium, still below the safe upper limit, but
<BR>
nevertheless undesirable.
<BR>
<P>However, in the same issue of JAMA is an editorial commentary which lays
<BR>
to rest the fears these findings may have evoked.  Robert P Heaney MD
<BR>
explains that lead is sometimes found with calcium due to calcium's
<BR>
chemical structure, and notes that manufacturers have have responded to
<BR>
consumer concerns by using calcium mined from deposits with lower lead
<BR>
levels, or by chemically processing the calcium to lower the lead content.
<BR>
This has lead to levels being undetectable in two-thirds of the
<BR>
supplements tested in the study, whereas a study seven years ago on
<BR>
seventy brands found lead in most of them. He notes that calcium both
<BR>
blocks intestinal lead absorption and prevents mobilization of the body's
<BR>
stored lead into the bloodstream, and that high calcium diets cause
<BR>
increased urinary excretion of lead.  Orally ingested lead would normally
<BR>
be absorbed with 20-50% efficiency, but when lead is simultaneously
<BR>
ingested with calcium, absorption is reduced by a factor of ten.
<BR>
<P>Very small amounts of lead are ingested on a daily basis from a normal
<BR>
diet.  Dr Heaney writes that such healthy foods as raisins, greens,
<BR>
berries and wine may have up to 200% the amount of lead as a calcium
<BR>
tablet, and that a lunch of a salad and a glass of wine could have ten
<BR>
times as much lead.  He points out the flaw in the report that there was
<BR>
no study of subjects taking these calcium supplements, and that blood
<BR>
levels of lead have decreased in inverse proportion to ingested calcium in
<BR>
all studies on the subject.
<BR>
<P>The last words of the editorial:  &quot;Calcium sources available today are
<BR>
generally very safe.&quot;   In view of the widespread calcium deficiency that
<BR>
exists, the real danger is avoiding calcium supplements.
<BR>
(JAMA, vol 284, no 11, September 20, 2000)
<BR>
<P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Osteoporosis
<BR>
<P>Normal aging causes a decline in bone density that occurs to varying
<BR>
degrees in otherwise healthy people. This decline does not induce bone
<BR>
fractures. Osteoporosis, on the other hand, causes a progressive marked
<BR>
reduction in bone mineral density that often results in pathological
<BR>
fractures, particularly of the vertebrae of the spine. It occurs more
<BR>
frequently in women than in men.
<BR>
<P>Many factors may cause osteoporotic bone loss that is not associated with
<BR>
aging. These include major surgery, glucocorticoid (anti-inflammatory
<BR>
steroid) drugs, liver cirrhosis, Crohn's inflammatory disease of the
<BR>
bowel, cystic fibrosis, and hormone deficiencies. This protocol confines
<BR>
itself to age-related osteoporosis.
<BR>
<P>For bone mineral maintenance and replacement, the Life Extension
<BR>
Foundation recommends that women take between 1000 and 2000 mg of
<BR>
elemental calcium along with 600 to 1000 mg of elemental magnesium every
<BR>
day. The addition of between 400 and 1000 IU of vitamin D3 is mandatory to
<BR>
ensure optimal calcium absorption. The inability to absorb calcium is a
<BR>
major reason that calcium therapy fails to prevent or slow the progression
<BR>
of osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 taken with calcium will normally promote
<BR>
absorption and assimilation of calcium into the bone matrix. Vitamin D3
<BR>
has also been shown to promote the production of IGF-1 and other growth
<BR>
factors in osteoporotic patients, which improves osteoblast
<BR>
(bone-building) function. Other minerals that are important for healthy
<BR>
bone metabolism include at least 30 mg a day of elemental zinc, 3 mg a day
<BR>
of elemental manganese, and 2 mg of elemental boron a day.

<BR>
<P>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<BR>
<P>Bone Assure
<BR>
<P>Commercial calcium supplements provide only limited protection against the
<BR>
demineralization of bone that occurs with aging. The scientific
<BR>
literature, on the other hand, documents a wide range of minerals that are
<BR>
vital to maintaining strong, healthy bones. For those who have already
<BR>
lost bone density, the proper combination of nutrients can help restore
<BR>
bone mass by rebuilding the organic matrix that holds minerals such as
<BR>
calcium in place.
<BR>
<P>Bone Assure is a comprehensive formula that can prevent osteoporosis in
<BR>
five different ways:
<BR>
<P>Protects bone mineral mass by providing potent amounts of elemental
<BR>
magnesium and a highly absorbable form of calcium (bis-glycinate) that has
<BR>
been shown to assimilate 1.8 times better than calcium citrate.
<BR>
<P>Maintains the organic bone matrix with the minerals zinc, manganese,
<BR>
silica and copper that are required for the formation of collagen and
<BR>
other living connective tissues. Manganese has been shown to specifically
<BR>
act as an anabolic catalyst in the development and maintenance of the
<BR>
organic bone matrix.
<BR>
<P>Facilitates the absorption of calcium into the bloodstream by providing
<BR>
vitamin D3.  Once in the bloodstream vitamin D3 then acts as a hormone to
<BR>
direct calcium into the bone matrix.
<BR>
<P>Prevents excessive urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium by providing
<BR>
the trace mineral boron.
<BR>
<P>Bone assure lowers toxic homocysteine levels that have been shown to
<BR>
damage the organic bone matrix by providing small amounts of folic acid,
<BR>
B6 and TMG.

<BR>
<P><P>Calcium Citrate with Vitamin D
<BR>
<P>Bone Assure is Life Extension's osteoporosis prevention formula.  For
<BR>
those who want to add calcium to Life Extension Mix, without the extra
<BR>
nutrients contained in Bone Assure, Calcium Citrate with Vitamin D is a
<BR>
good choice.
<BR>
<P>The citrate salt of calcium has been documented to be well absorbed and
<BR>
utilized by the body. Calcium is important in preventing a number of
<BR>
diseases in addition to osteoporosis. It blocks the absorption into the
<BR>
bloodstream of free radical-generating iron. Since many people have too
<BR>
much iron in their bodies, it makes sense to take calcium with those meals
<BR>
that contain high iron levels. Reducing iron levels is especially
<BR>
important for hepatitis C patients who suffer liver cell damage when the
<BR>
hepatitis virus interacts with iron. Be careful not to take calcium with
<BR>
food containing fiber, because fiber significantly intereferes with
<BR>
mineral absorption. It is best to take calcium supplements at night on an
<BR>
empty stomach. Also, since calcium will block iron absorption, avoid
<BR>
taking calcium with meals if you are iron deficient.
<BR>
<P>Each capsule contains 100 mg calcium citrate that provides 220 mg
<BR>
elemental calcium. There is 100 iu of vitamin D3 added to each capsule to
<BR>
enhance calcium absorption and utilization.
