<P><EM>&gt;Brian Atkins
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I thought it would be possible to nail down certain reasons in common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that was keeping more people from coming to the US. And I wanted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see if that reason might be that the people had gotten addicted to their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government even if it might be more rational to move to somewhere that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could result in the development of more personal power. That didn't happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well how about (of the top of my head):
<BR>
<P>- Having a family, friends and a house that you like around you?
<BR>
- 40 Hour actual work weeks, giving time for a life outside work?
<BR>
- Social and medical security
<BR>
- Being able to (mostly) do the work you want to allready
<BR>
- Having a nice paying job in a civilised part of the world. (And we all
<BR>
know that our own country is the most civilised in the world. Don't we?)
<BR>
<P>My government bugs me too, but it doesn't seem that you in the US are any
<BR>
less bugged about yours. The government is just the &quot;ecosystem&quot; in which you
<BR>
live. Once you get used to it it doesn't really matter that much. Only when
<BR>
thinking about it can it make my blood boil, but in my everyday living I
<BR>
don't really care.
<BR>
<P>I belive that my personal power is greater or at least as great as it would
<BR>
be in the US. (We had legal porn and gay marriages first i.e. ;-) )
<BR>
<P>If i wanted to start a new company, it might be more difficult than in the
<BR>
US, but if I go bankrupt I would not end out on the street. The government
<BR>
would give me and my family a 5 room appartment to live in. (Though not in
<BR>
that great a neighbourhood).
<BR>
<P>Probably what most US citisens miss about europe is the point that a any
<BR>
given culture / government / civilisation is a package. One cannot look at
<BR>
the high tax rate in isolation and say that becuse of that we are less free
<BR>
than in the US.
<BR>
<P>Some things seem restrictive and other seems nice.
<BR>
<P>High tax vs. free education for everyone, free health care, pension, social
<BR>
security, free infrastructure, inexpensive public transportation ... etc.
<BR>
<P>I am not saying that i think it should be this way, with cost completely
<BR>
decoupled from the services, but it is just not very black and white. Our
<BR>
system is different than yours, and I don't belive that you really
<BR>
understand it any more than we really understand yours.
<BR>
<P>The freedom is probably the same all things being equal.
<BR>
<P>The US isn't really that much of a goal from my point of view. What would be
<BR>
nice though would be someplace warm to live in the vinter like: Spain,
<BR>
Southern France, Florida, Australia or the like.
