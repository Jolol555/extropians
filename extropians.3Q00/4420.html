</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True, but you can get 20% panels, too, and more, if price is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevant (~32% is about the best we can get iirc with multilayer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GaAs). With 10% I'm operating on the low end of the efficiency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spectrum, not coincidentially the best efficiency in wattage/$
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produced.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that is my experience. The higher you go in efficiency, the cost rises
<BR>
faster, so its actually the least efficient technology that is most affordable
<BR>
and cost effective.

<EM>&gt;  &gt; atmosphere cuts solar flux from just over 1.4 kw/m^2 down to just over 1 kw/m^2.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The insolation figure is totally ad hoc, since I don't have access to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my library, and a websearch via dialup in Krautland is a bear. I just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought that 0.5 kW/m^2 on the average over a 10 h period in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; California-type area is the about the right ballpark figure, if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solar flux constant is 1.3 kW/m^2. I would of course welcome seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real numbers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You only get the 10 hour period if your panels are consistently reoriented to
<BR>
face the sun directly. Static panels will have a sine wave of intensity as the
<BR>
sun moves into and out of direct opposition (which in reality only occurs twice
<BR>
a year at most), in addition you have the sine wave of intensity imposed by the
<BR>
variance in the amount of atmosphere the sunlight travels through during the day
<BR>
causing variance in the insolation on site.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt; 2) solar cells do not require direct sunlight to generate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;    juice. diffuse daylight does nicely, especially when we're talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;    about amorphous cells.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Sure, but their efficiency decreases as flux decreases, and total flux does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; decrease with diffusion, as visible is converted to IR. If your flux drops by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought thin-film amorphous did at least NIR rather well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its works well as a sensor, but not really for power except at higher
<BR>
intensities, which are high enough that actually a thermal fluid system would be
<BR>
more effective.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; half due to diffusion by cloud cover, and the efficiency drops as well as flux
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; drops, your output decreases markedly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I did not know the average number of cloudy days in California, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just took 365, assuming the few 10 days would not make a difference,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as other parameters have been chosen rather conservatively, and this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a back of the envelope estimate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Death Valley is one thing. LA is another completely, where smog cuts several
<BR>
hours off of morning and evening sunlight. Don't know the exact number of sunny
<BR>
days, but its not quite as much as residents would like us to beleive, but
<BR>
definitely a significant number.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nitpicker!

<P>Ayuh!
