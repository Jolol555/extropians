1. &quot;RE: Carnosine&quot;
<BR>
Hi, Tom:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;50 mg of carnosine is useless. You need over 10 times that much to be of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any value. 6 ChronoForte caps contain 1000 mg.
</EM><BR>
<P>Similarly, the product description for this product says that a metabolizing 
<BR>
enzyme (carnosinase) will make amounts less than 1 g/day useless. What is 
<BR>
the basis for these dosing reccomendations?
<BR>
<P>-Michael
<BR>
<P>[A very good question which I have been wanting to get around to finding 
<BR>
out.
<BR>
This question illustrates the reason why I wanted to have every statement of 
<BR>
claim in the new Product Directory footnoted with a citation reference 
<BR>
number. However, LEF refuses to do that with any of their articles or even 
<BR>
their protocols, prefering instead to simply lump together all supporting 
<BR>
references at the end. For the products, it is much worse, they do not even 
<BR>
put references for claims in the Directory at all!
<BR>
Searching medline has not produced a complete answer (which made be in the 
<BR>
full text of some of the papers) but the following abstracts are relevant.
<BR>
Since &quot;Human tissue carnosinase is a non-specific dipeptidase, actively 
<BR>
hydrolysing many dipeptides, including prolinase substrates.&quot; it seems to me 
<BR>
that supplementing other safe and cheap dipeptidases (if such are available) 
<BR>
would spare the hydrolysis of carnosine and make lower doses effective.
<BR>
While searching medline and reading about the effects of carnosinase (there 
<BR>
are diseases of carnosinase deficiency), however, I also became concerned 
<BR>
about the effects of having it, in effect, continuously inhibited by keeping 
<BR>
it saturated by carnosine mega-supplementation (for example see the last 
<BR>
abstract below).

<P>The naturally occurring compound Nalpha-acetylcarnosine is proposed as a 
<BR>
prodrug of L-carnosine that is resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis by 
<BR>
carnosinase. Eyes of rabbits were treated with 1% Nalpha-acetylcarnosine, 
<BR>
L-carnosine, or placebo and extracts of the aqueous humor from the anterior 
<BR>
eye chamber were analyzed for imidazole content by reverse-phase analytical 
<BR>
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer (TLC) and 
<BR>
ion-exchange chromatographic techniques. Topical administration of pure 
<BR>
L-carnosine to the rabbit eye did not lead to accumulation of this compound 
<BR>
in the aqueous humor over 30 min in concentration exceeding that in the 
<BR>
placebo-treated matched eye. Nalpha-Acetylcarnosine showed dose-dependent 
<BR>
hydrolysis in its passage from the cornea to the aqueous humor, releasing 
<BR>
L-carnosine after l5-30 min of ocular administration of the prodrug in a

<P>Serum carnosinase activity was assayed in five groups of patients with
<BR>
neurological disorders. Enzyme activities in patients with idiopathic 
<BR>
epilepsy (mean +/- S.E.M., 148 +/- 11 nmol/ml per min) and motor neurone 
<BR>
disease (155 +/- 15 nmol/ml per min) were similar to the control group (161 
<BR>
+/- 7 nmol/ml per min). Reduced serum carnosinase activity was observed in 
<BR>
patients with Parkinson's disease (109 +/- 11 nmol/ml per min, P &lt; 0.005), 
<BR>
multiple sclerosis (82.5 +/- 10.0 nmol/ml per min, P &lt; 0.005) and patients 
<BR>
following a cerebrovascular accident (74.6 +/- 5.4 nmol/ml per min, P &lt; 
<BR>
0.001) compared with the control group. Carnosinase activity, 5-10% of that 
<BR>
found in serum, was detected in CSF samples. The cause of reduced serum 
<BR>
carnosinase activities in central nervous system disorders is unclear, 
<BR>
although anoxic damage to carnosinase-producing cells or disruption of the 
<BR>
blood-brain barrier may be responsible.

Intestinal absorption of the intact peptide carnosine in man, and comparison 
<BR>
with intestinal permeability to lactulose.

<P>1. Healthy humans ingested the dipeptide carnosine 
<BR>
(L-beta-alanyl-L-histidine). Their plasma levels and urinary outputs of 
<BR>
carnosine and beta-alanine were monitored over the following 5 h. 2. Large 
<BR>
amounts of intact carnosine (up to 14% of the ingested dose) were recovered 
<BR>
in the urine over the 5 h after ingestion. However, carnosine was 
<BR>
undetectable in the plasma unless precautions were taken to inhibit blood 
<BR>
carnosinase activity ex vivo during and after blood collection. 3. The 
<BR>
amount of carnosine recovered in urine varied substantially between 
<BR>
subjects. It correlated negatively with carnosinase enzymic activity in the 
<BR>
plasma. Highest carnosinase activities were observed in those subjects who 
<BR>
regularly underwent physical training. 4. Urinary recovery of the 
<BR>
disaccharide lactulose also varied considerably between subjects, but was 
<BR>
substantially lower than that of carnosine. There was no significant 
<BR>
correlation between the recoveries of carnosine and lactulose. 5. When 
<BR>
lactulose was ingested with a hypertonic solution, the urinary recovery of 
<BR>
lactulose was generally increased. When carnosine was ingested with a 
<BR>
hypertonic solution, the urinary recovery of carnosine was reduced: hence 
<BR>
the paracellular route probably is not dominant for absorption of intact 
<BR>
carnosine. 6. Intact carnosine must have crossed the intestine to an extent 
<BR>
much greater than hitherto recognized. Rapid post-absorptive hydrolysis is a 
<BR>
severe obstacle to quantification of intact peptide absorption.

Purification and properties of human serum carnosinase.

<BR>
<P>Carnosinase from human plasma was purified 18,000-fold to apparent 
<BR>
homogeneity in a four step procedure. The dipeptidase was partially 
<BR>
inactivated during DEAE-cellulose chromatography; however, it reactivated 
<BR>
slowly when concentrated and stored at 4 degrees C. In the second 
<BR>
purification step, hydroxylapatite column chromatography, two forms of the 
<BR>
enzyme were separated from one another. Human serum carnosinase was found to 
<BR>
be a glycoprotein with a pI of 4.4 and a subunit Mr of 75,000; the active 
<BR>
enzyme was a dimer, the two subunits being connected by one or more 
<BR>
disulfide bonds. The enzyme was especially active in hydrolyzing carnosine 
<BR>
and anserine, preferring dipeptides with histidine in the C-terminal 
<BR>
position. In most human tissues, the concentration of serum carnosinase was 
<BR>
proportional to the percentage of trapped blood in the sample. However, the 
<BR>
brain contained about 9 times more enzyme than expected, based on the amount 
<BR>
of trapped blood present. The physiological function of this enzyme seems to 
<BR>
be the hydrolysis of homocarnosine in the brain and the splitting of 
<BR>
carnosine and anserine in the blood stream. Six higher primates were found 
<BR>
to have serum carnosinase. Twelve nonprimate mammals were tested; all were 
<BR>
lacking the serum enzyme except for the Golden hamster, which had very high 
<BR>
concentrations of a carnosinase having somewhat different properties than 
<BR>
the higher primate enzyme.

Serum carnosinase deficiency: a non-disabling phenotype?
<BR>
Cohen M, Hartlage PL, Krawiecki N, Roesel RA, Carter AL, Hommes FA
<BR>
<P>Serum carnosinase deficiency (McKusick 21220) is a rare condition, described 
<BR>
in 13 cases. Ten additional individuals with serum carnosinase deficiency 
<BR>
have been identified. All continued to excrete increased amounts of 
<BR>
carnosine in their urine despite a meat-free diet for 3 days. Serum 
<BR>
carnosinase activity ranged from 0-30% of normal. In four individuals a 
<BR>
normal Km for carnosine of 0.12 mM was observed, while in five individuals 
<BR>
an increased Km was found. Homocarnosine levels in CSF in three individuals 
<BR>
ranged from 3.4 to 15 mM. Clinical symptoms in these individuals were as 
<BR>
follows: attention deficit disorder: 4; non progressive developmental delay: 
<BR>
1; neurofibromatosis: 1; absences seizures: 1; severe, but non-progressive 
<BR>
mental retardation, seizures and neurosensory hearing loss: 1; progressive 
<BR>
childhood dementia; 1; clinically normal: 1. There was no correlation 
<BR>
between severity and type of the neurological symptoms and residual serum 
<BR>
carnosinase activity. Although a definite conclusion can only be made after 
<BR>
a considerably higher number of individuals has been analyzed, the suspicion 
<BR>
that serum carnosinase deficiency is unrelated to the neurological symptoms 
<BR>
is strengthened by these observations. There may, however, be an association 
<BR>
with a predisposition for mental deficiency.
