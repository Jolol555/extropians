Hi,
<BR>
<P>I want the government to pay me to make part of the national ballistic
<BR>
missile defense.
<BR>
<P>My plan is to put up four or five thousand microsatellites in very plotted
<BR>
orbits thus to not be space debris that at any time could be aimed at
<BR>
hostile booster rockets on the way up thus to avoid the issue of
<BR>
discriminating among multiple reentry warheads.
<BR>
<P>That plan would cost less and subsidize the development of inexpensive
<BR>
launch mchinery, perhaps even the National Aerospace Plane.
<BR>
<P>So, this thread is telling me that to get business from the government
<BR>
requires a lot of lawyers and contract writers.  The rest, of course, would
<BR>
be subcontracted to real-world engineers.
<BR>
<P>Well, a shower curtain might be fireproof and a hammer containing
<BR>
micrometers, but ut is still so that the government has paid thousands of
<BR>
dollars for a single coffee machine to some green machine purpose.
<BR>
<P>Of course, we could always encourage the military to subsidize itself with
<BR>
bake sales, or, as in the case in which the commander of the U.S. military
<BR>
in Colombia has shown how to do:  coke sales.  Off topic:  the right wing
<BR>
paramilitary organization sponsored by the government, police, and coke
<BR>
sales in Colombia is probably guilty of the most human rights infractions in
<BR>
this hemisphere in the last year.
<BR>
<P>Here's something to consider:  1/4 of all entire federal budget is military
<BR>
or military-construction based.  That is to say:  about 25 cents of each tax
<BR>
dollar, if anyone knew how many there were, are spent on military or
<BR>
military construction accounts.  Yet, unless one is building things for the
<BR>
government ala high-speed low target offset tolerance research testbed
<BR>
rockets and thus being paid in the name of that budget, or is otherwise in
<BR>
the military, it doesn't do the country any good.  The last U.S. limitary
<BR>
expedition was Serbia where the U.S. was part of the U.N. forces, where
<BR>
there were enough bombs sitting around requiring budget justification to
<BR>
drop one on the Chinese embassy.  As well, for some time, the U.S. enforced
<BR>
the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone over Iraq.  Still, we have hundreds of thousands of
<BR>
active-duty troops who will never see combat.

<EM>&gt; NAVY THEATERWIDE ABM TEST FAILS: The Navy Theater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wide (NTW) program flight test round-1 (FTR-1) failed on Friday,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but the service vowed that the program would forge ahead with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; series of flights and evaluations over the next three years. &quot;We don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have any information on what really happened as yet; all we know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at this point is that third stage did not separate,&quot; a Navy spokeswoman
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said yesterday. &quot;There are no implications on the overall program.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FTR-1 test was the first risk reduction flight of the Raytheon Standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Missile-3 (SM-3) third-stage rocket motor and the second flight overall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the Aegis LEAP intercept (ALI) test series, according to a Navy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement. The SM-3 is in development as the long-range exoatmospheric
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; missile to combat theater ballistic missiles, similar to mission of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense program, which is built
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin builds the Aegis weapon system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that controls missile targeting and launch. Also, the company developed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the vertical launch systems from which the interceptor rockets are to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fired. (Defense Daily)
