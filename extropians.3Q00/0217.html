<EM>&gt; cognitive science and evolutionary psychology.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always been somewhere between bottom-up and top-down; I
<BR>
don't think of the brain as &quot;one big pattern catcher&quot; but I
<BR>
don't think it's &quot;Cyc + natural selection&quot; either.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Furthermore - although this statement is my own personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinion, and not experimentally verified fact - I disagree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with your position that useful mutations are less likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to occur within the brain.  The brain is adaptive.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain is self-repairing.  The brain is self-programming.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The brain has a logic that proteins, organs, and tissues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't.  I would expect useful mutations to be an order of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; magnitude more likely within the brain.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but doesn't your position suggest a more homogeneous
<BR>
brain, which seems at odds with pre-wired instincts?  This
<BR>
is the problem I see: there's a trade off between
<BR>
specificity and constraint on the one hand and generality
<BR>
and adaptability on the other hand.  That is, I can either
<BR>
have a &quot;fragile&quot; brain where I can make specific changes, or
<BR>
a flexible brain where I can only make very general changes.
<BR>
(I tend to think of Cyc and &quot;pattern catchers&quot; as being
<BR>
opposite extremes in this spectrum.)
