<EM>&gt; &gt; to open an account with a US stock brokerage, and again using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; freedom software you could anonymously trade..
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Umm, US laws don't generally permit this type of thing, I think,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though I'm not 100% positive.  Certainly my brokerages wanted a *lot*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of information about me, including IRS good standing.  I guess there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be some that do it, but I think the SEC would take a dim view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ... transfer your profits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; occasionally back to the bank account, and from there to your US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bank account. You could tell the IRS you don't know who these magic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; payments come from, perhaps a secret admirer :-) And voila, no more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; capital gains taxes.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then, even worse, it's income!  Even if it's an anoymous gift (yeah,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right, the IRS believes that) you still owe income taxes on it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Income taxes are worse than capital gains taxes for non-trivial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incomes.  At least with regular capital gains they're exempt from any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; income taxes, municipal, state or federal.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, unless your account is a numbered account at a bank that does not bend over
<BR>
for the IRS, the IRS can track you down. Outside of numbered accounts, living in
<BR>
a cash economy, avoiding accounts, credit cards, ATMs, etc. is the only way to
<BR>
disguise your actual income. Even that though, is coming to an end. One feature
<BR>
of the new cash being printed are embedded, readable codes, which a new
<BR>
generation of scanning devices are meant to be able to process, so even your
<BR>
cash transactions can be tracked by the serial number of the bills. The bank
<BR>
will report what checks were cashed in return for the bill serial numbers, so
<BR>
they can track the bill from the time you cash a check to the point you spend it
<BR>
(the restaurant, store, etc that receives your cash will deposit it at their
<BR>
bank, which will scan in the bills. The IRS will know where you spend every
<BR>
dollar bill.
