<EM>&gt; [... random entry into dangerous thread ...]
</EM><BR>
<P>I prefer to think of it as a friendly discussion.  It's also good to be
<BR>
outnumbered and the lone person going against the grain here.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; This is really only so with Modernist Art and Postmodernist Art.  While
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  taste vary from age to age, from person to person, it's only with the
</EM><BR>
20th
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  century that we get works which would only fit an elitist,
</EM><BR>
authoritarian
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  definition of art -- i.e., &quot;Art is what artists or the art
</EM><BR>
establishment
<BR>
<EM>&gt; say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  is art, objectivity be damned!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think this is entirely true:  There have been &quot;official&quot;
</EM><BR>
definitions
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of art, high and low, in many other periods, from the influence of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; National Academies in France and the UK in the 18th-19th centuries back to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the impact of royal or ecclesiastical patronage in earlier times.  Those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institutions sought to create a bright line between art/not-art.  Your
</EM><BR>
point
<BR>
<EM>&gt; may be that what was called &quot;art&quot; by these official arbiters of taste
</EM><BR>
WOULD
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have been considered &quot;art&quot; by all, but I'm not so sure . . .
</EM><BR>
<P>The authoritarian definition of art is a specific definition, not a general
<BR>
case of an authority given his or her defintion of art.  Instead, strictly,
<BR>
as used in current esthetics, it's where artists or the art Establishment
<BR>
defines art based on its decree.  Former ages usually had some pretense of a
<BR>
definition outside their whim or fancy.
<BR>
<P>An example might help here.  I'll stick to painting and to an example from
<BR>
around 1900:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The art of painting is the selective representation on a plane surface of
<BR>
objects, real or imagined, by means of spaces, lines, colors, and variations
<BR>
of light and dark, all of which elements, as well as the materials employed,
<BR>
have been subjected to some principle of order for the attainment of unity.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This comes from Kenyon Cox in his essay collection _What is Painting?_.
<BR>
(Cox was a painter, teacher, an art critic.  So, those who might claim he
<BR>
was ignorant -- an accusation leveled in this forum before -- of his subject
<BR>
matter are, well, wrong.  Not that his credentials should matter.  His views
<BR>
should stand or fall on their own.)  This is not the tightest definition,
<BR>
but notice from it, I don't need to rely on Cox's authority or what he
<BR>
liked.  Instead, we can ponder it and see if paintings actually fit into it
<BR>
and test it by seeing if it includes non-paintings.  We can't do that with
<BR>
the authoritarian (or institutional) definition(s) of art.  (The
<BR>
institutional definition is where the art establishment defines what art is.
<BR>
This establishment is taken, usually, to be those who are accepted already
<BR>
as artists, art critics, art historians, patrons, etc.  Note the circularity
<BR>
inherent in both definitions.  If one doesn't accept person X as an artist
<BR>
or group Y as part of the art establishment, then whatever he/she or they
<BR>
call art might not be art.  Imagine if physics operated the same way.  A
<BR>
physicist might say whatever she calls energy is energy, defintion be
<BR>
damned!  Surely, we'd all laugh, especially if her theories did not work or
<BR>
explain anything.  Not so with art.  Instead, such people in the art world
<BR>
are called ahead of their time.:)
<BR>
<P>I compare Cox to Rand at <A HREF="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Kenyon.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Kenyon.html</A> for
<BR>
those who are interested.
<BR>
<P>It's also true, that in former times, the masses and the art establishment
<BR>
were more in line with their respective views on art.  Granted, the
<BR>
illiterate Italian peasant might not have been able to critique
<BR>
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel interior, but the differences in view were
<BR>
more that of the lay person versus the expert where both agreed roughly on
<BR>
the boundaries -- even if only implicitly.
<BR>
<P>With Modernism and Postmodernism, we have a different ball of wax.  Now, the
<BR>
specific authoritarian definition given above -- whoever calls him/herself
<BR>
an artist gets to define art, meaning anything goes.  Generally, they do not
<BR>
like it when their &quot;art&quot; is called &quot;non-art.&quot;  They like that label and wish
<BR>
to keep it on their stuff, no matter how unartlike their stuff is.
<BR>
<P>Not such a big deal but our tax dollars are supporting such &quot;art.&quot;  Of
<BR>
course, this goes for genuine art too.  I don't think anyone should be
<BR>
forced to support it.  And for those who might think I lack compassion here,
<BR>
I not only buy art (from prints to CDs to poetry books), I do frequent
<BR>
museums, theaters, cinemas, galleries, and concerts.  So I support it
<BR>
already.  I also see lots of other people doing the same.  Granted, I'm not
<BR>
feeding starving artists, but I do my part.  Nothing to brag about, just
<BR>
trying to disarm the highly vocal libertarian-bashers.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
