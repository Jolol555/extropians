EARTH LIBERATION FRONT (ELF) CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR SABOTAGE AT U.S. 
<BR>
FOREST 
<BR>
SERVICE'S NORTH CENTRAL RESEARCH STATION - FOREST BIOTECHNOLOGY LABORATORY
<BR>
<P>RHINELANDER, WI - The underground Earth Liberation Front (E.L.F.) has claimed 
<BR>
responsibility for sabotaging a genetic engineering research program and ten 
<BR>
vehicles at the U.S., Forest Service's North Central Research Station - 
<BR>
Biotechnology Laboratory in Rhinelander, Wisconsin on July 20, 2000.  Damage 
<BR>
estimates are unknown at this time.
<BR>
<P>A communiqué sent by the E.L.F. stated, &quot;Over 500 research pine and broadleaf 
<BR>
trees and saplings were cut down, ring barked and trampled.  Additionally, 
<BR>
ten 
<BR>
Forest Service trucks were defaced and calling cards were left behind.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The E.L.F. is an international organization that uses direct action to stop 
<BR>
the systematic exploitation and destruction of the natural environment.
<BR>
<P>The communiqué continued,  &quot;In Rhinelander, the Forest Service is mapping the 
<BR>
DNA of white pine and attempting to genetically engineer them to be resistant 
<BR>
to pine rust.  Why?  To aid industry in creating disease-resistant trees 
<BR>
suitable for tree farms that will increase their profits.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Don't get us wrong - &quot; the communiqué continued, &quot;this action is against the 
<BR>
Forest Service, not just one particular project or research program.  What 
<BR>
they do on a daily basis is sheer genocide: putting forth the notion that 
<BR>
they 
<BR>
are 'managing' life, running an asinine timber program that destroys the last 
<BR>
of the old-growth and mars everything else, cutting deep into roadless areas 
<BR>
in Idaho, spraying biocides like Btk in forests in Eastern Oregon and 
<BR>
Washington under the guise of 'pest management', treating wildlife as some 
<BR>
numbers on a graph.  The list goes on.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This is the sixth major action claimed by the E.L.F. this year in the United 
<BR>
States.  Since 1997 the group has inflicted well over $31 million in damages 
<BR>
to entities profiting off the destruction of the natural environment.  Other 
<BR>
notorious actions by the E.L.F. have included the $24 million blaze at Vail 
<BR>
Resorts Inc, in Colorado in October, 1998, the fire destroying a genetic 
<BR>
engineering program at Michigan State University on December 31, 1999, and a 
<BR>
fire which burned the Northwest headquarters of Boise Cascade in Oregon on 
<BR>
December 25, 1999.

<BR>
<P>THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE WAS RECEIVED BY THE NORTH AMERICAN EARTH LIBERATION 
<BR>
FRONT PRESS OFFICE
<BR>
<P><P>&quot;20 July 2000
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;On behalf of native forests everywhere, we attacked the US Forest Service's 
<BR>
&nbsp;North Central Research Station Forest Biotechnology Laboratory in 
<BR>
&nbsp;Rhinelander, Wisconsin last night. Over 500 research pine and broadleaf 
<BR>
&nbsp;trees and saplings were cut down, ring-barked and trampled. Additionally, 
<BR>
ten 
<BR>
&nbsp;Forest Service trucks were defaced and calling cards were left behind. Due 
<BR>
&nbsp;to an overzealous security guard, we had to make an earlier than anticipated 
<BR>
&nbsp;exit.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;In Rhinelander, the Forest Service is mapping the DNA of white pine and 
<BR>
&nbsp;attempting to genetically engineer them to be resistant to pine rust. Why? 
<BR>
&nbsp;To aid industry in creating disease-resistant trees suitable for tree farms 
<BR>
&nbsp;that will increase their profits. Despite the obvious threat of genetic 
<BR>
&nbsp;pollution by GE trees, these fools, aided by industry financing, plod ahead 
<BR>
&nbsp;in the name of science.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Don't get us wrong-this action is against the Forest Service, not just one 
<BR>
&nbsp;particular project or research program. What they do on a daily basis is 
<BR>
&nbsp;sheer genocide: putting forth the notion that they are &quot;managing&quot; life, 
<BR>
&nbsp;running an asinine timber program that destroys the last of the old-growth 
<BR>
&nbsp;and mars everything else, cutting deep into roadless areas in Idaho, 
<BR>
&nbsp;spraying biocides like Btk in forests in Eastern Oregon and Washington under 
<BR>
&nbsp;the guise of &quot;pest management&quot;, treating wildlife as some numbers on a 
<BR>
&nbsp;graph. The list goes on.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;On that note, we strongly advise our allies to cease their quibbling with 
<BR>
the 
<BR>
&nbsp;Forest Service over details of their genocidal plans i.e. roadless policy, 
<BR>
&nbsp;promises of no logging on public land etc. The sooner we realize that the 
<BR>
&nbsp;Forest Service, like industry, are capitalists driven by an insane desire to 
<BR>
&nbsp;make money and control life, the better. Than we can start taking more 
<BR>
&nbsp;appropriate action.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;As for the feds- we know that you are stepping up the pressure by harassing 
<BR>
&nbsp;press officers and other absurdities. What you don't realize is that we are 
<BR>
&nbsp;infiltrating your ranks and gathering our own information. We could be that 
<BR>
&nbsp;temp worker typing away on your disgusting computer. We could even be your 
<BR>
&nbsp;secretary or intern.
<BR>
&nbsp;We are everywhere and nowhere and we are watching.
<BR>
For wildness and an end to industrial society,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;ELF
<BR>
&nbsp;Earth Liberation Front&quot;
