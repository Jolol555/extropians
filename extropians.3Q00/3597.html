<P>Right!  We as extropians may have been exactly wrong about one thing:
<BR>
our notion that greater freedom comes from having freedom from religion.
<BR>
Perhaps we need *more* religions, lots of different ones, lots of them that
<BR>
are mutually exclusive!  That way, people can get all the religious fixes that
<BR>
humans seem to need, yet there is plenty of evidence for anyone who cares
<BR>
to see, that these ridiculous notions cannot *all* be true, but they definitely
<BR>
*can* all be wrong.
<BR>
<P>Let us encourage all religions, and hope none of them get more popular
<BR>
than the others, so there are a jillion little churches, all fighting for market
<BR>
<P>share.  &quot;You guys worship buddha, you other guys worship yhwh, you
<BR>
over there worship cucumbers...&quot;  All with different rules of moral conduct
<BR>
and none with a majority.  Welcome them all, and offer an alternative
<BR>
for those who see the madness of it all.   spike
