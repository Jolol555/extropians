<P>
<EM>&gt; Trademarks can be transformed into cryptographic signatures by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; author's key.  This will make it impossible to pass something else off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as being by another author, without their consent.
</EM><BR>
<P>Trademark enforcement is made easier by the fact that a trademark's
<BR>
value is inherently correlated with how well-known it is.  We might need
<BR>
digital signatures to prevent me from forging an email in your name,
<BR>
but if I tried to pass off my book as the next Steven King novel,
<BR>
everyone would know about it and I wouldn't get to square one.  No
<BR>
fancy technology needed--just a call to Mr. King's agent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Fraud is more difficult, but the specific case of taking someone else's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work and claiming it is yours may be able to be dealt with by using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; digital watermarks.  The author's name could be embedded quasi-invisibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in their work.  If someone else claimed to have created it, the author
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could release a short program which would decrypt and expose the hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; data.  Watermarks are not a particularly robust technology at present,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but this could work in some circumstances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A simpler method would be digital timestamps, in which a secure notarizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; service allows the author to prove that they were the first one to create
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a particular work.  In that case it would be easy to handle cases of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disputed authorship.
</EM><BR>
<P>Signed timestamps have been in use for a long time--the BETSY service
<BR>
will take incoming text over email and sign it with a timestamp.  It's
<BR>
original intent was to prove &quot;prior art&quot; in patent disputes, but it
<BR>
can be used in combination with digital signature for fraud prevention
<BR>
as well.
<BR>
<P>Watermarks are trickier.  You can't really embed them in text, but you
<BR>
can in images and probably music.  It should be quite possible, for
<BR>
example, for a band to create files of its songs that contained
<BR>
a steganographic watermark that pointed to the band's own website, so
<BR>
that anyone who got the file from any source could still ask eir
<BR>
appropriately-configured software where it came from and how ey can
<BR>
get more of the same.  I should probably recommend a standard for this
<BR>
to the OGG Vobis folks, as they are the format that will probably take
<BR>
over from MP3.
