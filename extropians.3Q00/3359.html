<EM>&gt; The following is my very strangest Internet-name experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Three years ago, a woman at a department at the Carolinas HealthCare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; System in Charlotte, NC, wrote me, in quest of some background information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a quotation that the Vice President made in a presentation. The V.P.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found the quotation in material he had from his previous job at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a management consultant company: Ernest and Young.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The women told me that the quotation is called &quot;Amara's Law&quot;:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;In reacting to change, there is a tendency to overestimate the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impact of change in the short run and underestimate its long term impact.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;blinkblink&gt;  I've heard of &quot;Amara's Law&quot; - exactly that phrasing, too.
<BR>
I never made the connection to the Amara on this list.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I thought: HOLY-MOLEY!! (as Batman says). This quotation was taken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a post I made to the sci.physics Usenet group 1 1/2 years earlier,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the &quot;Physics of Traffic Flows&quot;, where I said:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;One rule-of-thumb in responding to any stimulus that one does not want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become unstable is: the longer one waits in response to a stimulus, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strength of that response should be exponentially less with respect to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that time.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ne, but that's not a short, snappy sound bite, so why shouldn't people
<BR>
mess with it 'til they can remember it?  ^_^;  (Yeah, I know, it has
<BR>
little to do with why you posted it, but *still*...)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So my Usenet post surfaces in a slightly different way as &quot;Amara's Law&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a management department in a health care company in South Carolina?!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (EEEK)
</EM><BR>
<P>The context I heard of it in is wide-spread/generic use.  For example,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.byte.com/column/BYT19990928S0001">http://www.byte.com/column/BYT19990928S0001</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I gave the woman my post that began the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing,(<A HREF="http://www.amara.com/ftpstuff/traffic.txt">http://www.amara.com/ftpstuff/traffic.txt</A>), I asked her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to please get the attribution right (to Elliot Montroll), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then I asked myself whether it was time to quit Usenet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So you see Eli, Real Life is Stranger than Fiction.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you sure that you're the Amara it's attributed to?  Granted, &quot;Amara&quot;
<BR>
is not the most common of names, but it could have been put out by
<BR>
another Amara.
