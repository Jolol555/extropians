Hello everyone,
<BR>
<P>This is a very fascinating post from cryonet which was written by prominent 
<BR>
cryonicist Paul Wakfer.  In terms of informing us what the current state of 
<BR>
cryonics is along with some very interesting past history I would say all 
<BR>
should read this.  I greatly respect Paul for his noble Prometheus Project 
<BR>
which failed for reasons he gives here.  I am glad my friend is feeling good 
<BR>
about life...
<BR>
<P>John

<EM>&gt;Subject: Where is a current summary?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Greetings All:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is a request for a pointer to a site that summarizes the current 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;state-of-the-art.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no site where this is all summarized. The information is very
<BR>
scattered, and/or not yet written down. This is mainly the result of the 
<BR>
constant infighting which goes on in a fringe group like the world of 
<BR>
cryonics, for control of the very small pond in which all these frogs are 
<BR>
croaking to each other.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Two or three years ago I found material which put me pretty well up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things.
</EM><BR>
<P>Now where might you have found that? the Prometheus Project (PP)
<BR>
website, perhaps?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As I recall the overall status, vitrification was promising and it appeared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crystalization might be prevented during freezing by using a high pressure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chamber.  However it tended to occur during thawing too unless very high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thaw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rates were used.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was only an interim step during the research which Greg Fahy was
<BR>
doing to reversibly cryopreserve kidneys. In fact, not only was it
<BR>
always deemed impractical for whole body humans, but he very soon found that 
<BR>
the pressure itself induced additional unrecoverable damage, and soon after 
<BR>
abandoned the pressure approach.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It was impossible to achieve such rates (and -- was there a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;uniformity problem with some regions remaining too cold?) [Is this still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;true?]
</EM><BR>
<P>No. All those ideas have been superseded now. 21st Century Medicine (21CM) 
<BR>
has developed ice blockers and new cryoprotectants which enable 
<BR>
vitrification at high enough cryoprotectant (CPA) concentrations that 
<BR>
recrystallization during thawing should be
<BR>
avoidable at the rate of warming which can be reasonably achieved.
<BR>
<P>All of this has been hastened by the development by Critical Care
<BR>
Research (CCR - a split-off of the original 21CM) of perfluorocarbon
<BR>
perfusion methods which allow very rapid cooling and warming of whole
<BR>
bodies even, right down to the vitrification holding temperatures
<BR>
required.
<BR>
<P>Basically, things are looking exceedingly optimistic that perfected
<BR>
whole body suspended animation could be &quot;just around the corner&quot;, if we 
<BR>
could only get these short-sighted, head-in-the-sand, money-hoarding 
<BR>
cryonicists to fork over the necessary cash. I hasten to add that my 
<BR>
comments do not apply to those few wonderful, courageous, and fully rational 
<BR>
people who have monetarily supported all the research to achieve these 
<BR>
goals, and, of course, to the researchers themselves.
<BR>
As it is, the work of proving out, completing development, and
<BR>
perfecting the breakthroughs outlined above is ongoing, albeit at a very 
<BR>
slow pace.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Overall, everything from embryos to aortas could be frozen and thawed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;successfully, but nothing bigger.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even embryos, sperm, and some other things were only viable because they 
<BR>
could incur large cell loss and still recover (lots of individual sperm, and 
<BR>
multiple totipotent cells in an early stage embryo - the only kind which 
<BR>
worked). The CPA's and methods used do not produce high levels of individual 
<BR>
cell viability. The 21CM developments should be marketable for these 
<BR>
purposes so that far higher viabilities can be obtained.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;21CM thought they had money and capability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to succeed with kidneys and that would give them money enough to go on to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whole bodies in ten years or so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here you are slightly mixing up 21CM and PP. 21CM began to concentrate
<BR>
on kidneys because that was the specialty and ongoing project of Greg
<BR>
Fahy who had just joined them. However, I admit that your mixup is very 
<BR>
reasonable since the pronouncements and policies of 21CM on the subject of 
<BR>
suspended animation research changed back and forth so many times that even 
<BR>
I, a relative insider, could not keep track of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now I gather that 21CM has  found improved vitrification fluids that by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves leave brain slices ~95 percent functional (not after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freeze-and-thaw, just after exposure to the fluid.)
</EM><BR>
<P>No. This has not been demonstrated yet, partly because 21CM is not
<BR>
working with brain slices. That it the research project of the Institute for 
<BR>
Neurocryobiology's Hippocampal Slice Cryopreservation Project (HSCP) in full 
<BR>
cooperation with 21CM, of course. What you have read about 95% is that 
<BR>
*rabbit kidney* slices have been loaded and unloaded (immersed to 
<BR>
equilibration and then fully washed-out), with 95% recovery in comparison to 
<BR>
controls simply kept in a nutrient solution.
<BR>
<P>In addition, this &quot;viability&quot; is not assessed in terms of &quot;functionality&quot; 
<BR>
since that cannot be done for kidney slice, which are no longer &quot;functional&quot; 
<BR>
by definition. Instead the viability is only &quot;cellular&quot; viability as 
<BR>
determined by the intracellular sodium/potassium ratio, which can only be 
<BR>
kept stable by a cell whose mitochondrial energy cycle is completely 
<BR>
operational. While this is a good measure of cellular viability it does not 
<BR>
measure all cellular function nor does it measure intercellular 
<BR>
functionality which is crucial for brain tissue.
<BR>
<P>INC is now trying to garner the funds to proceed to show that the
<BR>
improved CPA also give higher (than the 52% we currently have) cellular 
<BR>
viability for rat hippocampal slices even after vitrification and thawing.
<BR>
<P>Once that is complete, INC hopes to get back the original project of
<BR>
obtaining propagation of evokes potentials across a brain slice as
<BR>
outlined in the research proposal at <A HREF="http://neurocryo.org">http://neurocryo.org</A> Of course,
<BR>
this will require still more money, but if successful will give a very
<BR>
meaningful and realistic demonstration that these vitrified/rewarmed
<BR>
hippocampal slices have truly been through perfected suspended
<BR>
animation. Whole brains will then be the next step, and thereafter whole 
<BR>
bodies!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And nobody else seems to be making progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nobody else is even trying!! Half of them are busy counting the number
<BR>
of identities on the head of a pin, and the other half are waiting for
<BR>
the Nanotechnology God to save their asses while get on with life as
<BR>
usual.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also, Prometheus had received some money but afterwards the site never 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seemed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be updated. [Did it get more or what?]
</EM><BR>
<P>PP was pure pledge campaign to attempt to garner sufficient support to
<BR>
perfect suspended animation. It was never intended to collect any money 
<BR>
until it has sufficient pledges to do the project, and it never received a 
<BR>
cent. I personally received a few hundred dollars of support from Roy Yowell 
<BR>
and additional support in man-hours, particularly from Leonard Zubkoff, both 
<BR>
of whom I wish to thank again. It is noteworthy that these same two 
<BR>
individuals and many other PP pledgers also donated the funds which allowed 
<BR>
the HSCP to get to where it is today. In addition, there were a few people 
<BR>
who were not PP pledgers who also donated money to support the HSCP.
<BR>
<P>The plan for PP was to get sufficient pledges, without requiring any up 
<BR>
front cash,
<BR>
1) to shock people into believing that the project could actually be
<BR>
realized,
<BR>
2) to pressure the cryonics organizations (who are all jealously
<BR>
guarding their own &quot;territory&quot;) to realize that in their own best
<BR>
interest they had better jump on the bandwagon, and
<BR>
3) to garner enough credibility, in terms of potential monetary support and 
<BR>
the establishment &quot;legitimacy&quot; which comes with it, that the scientists 
<BR>
whose support and participation was needed would write a full proposal so 
<BR>
that the rest of the pledged funding could be obtained.
<BR>
<P>The first of those three succeeded better than anyone (including me)
<BR>
imagined that it would.
<BR>
<P>The second of these failed miserably, either because of my lack of tact and 
<BR>
ass-kissing ability, or because of the intransigent, pig-headedness and/or 
<BR>
power lust of the major cryonics leaders (of Alcor and CI), or perhaps 
<BR>
because they don't really want to live in a world where some upstart can 
<BR>
succeed where they could not. All the reasons for rejecting support for PP 
<BR>
were totally specious, but these leaders were and still are masters of the 
<BR>
art of political rationalization, casting doubt, and making false arguments 
<BR>
just logical enough that they are believable to naive, trusting souls. I 
<BR>
could not counter such tactics and do not want ever to be able to do so.
<BR>
<P>The third of these also failed miserably because I, being a naive,
<BR>
trusting soul, did not make a written contractual understanding about
<BR>
what the results of certain of my actions would be. Thus, I brought the 
<BR>
necessary leverage (PP and a pilot project proposal and available
<BR>
funding which became the HSCP) to bear to cause *the* crucial scientist to 
<BR>
enter the cryonics research fold expecting that he would then write the full 
<BR>
PP science plan which was necessary to revive the pledge campaign.
<BR>
<P>However, the die was cast and I came up the loser. The scientist became 
<BR>
contractually obligated to those whom I had conspired with, was not to be 
<BR>
available to write the PP plan, and would also not be available to oversee 
<BR>
the project as principal investigator. In addition, the company employing 
<BR>
that scientist took all the wind from the PP sails by placing itself in 
<BR>
direct competition, even with a head start, so that it now appeared clear to 
<BR>
most of the previous and potential new pledgers that they could once more 
<BR>
feel at east to sit on their asses and spend their hard earned income on 
<BR>
immediate gratification or personal wealth building.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I am sure others will have a different &quot;story&quot; on all these
<BR>
things. You will have to judge for yourself by judging what is essential and 
<BR>
what is inessential in all these viewpoints.
<BR>
<P>Finally, the PP website has not been updated, because there has really
<BR>
been nothing positive to say, and while I had little heart to do
<BR>
anything, I still thought there might be some value in keeping it there (all 
<BR>
at my expense, of course), if for no other reason, as a monument to &quot;what 
<BR>
might have been and should have been&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Can anyone correct and update the summary?  Is there a single site where I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can track the status and progress of the problems?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have tried my best to do the first. If you have any questions, I will try 
<BR>
to answer them. As for the second it is not likely to happen while cryonics 
<BR>
retains the fragmented, cultist, inbred, ingrown and navel gazing state that 
<BR>
it now
<BR>
has.
<BR>
<P>On a personal note, I am not nearly as bitter as it may appear from the 
<BR>
above remarks. I am now leading an ecstatically happy and complete life, 
<BR>
pursuing life-extension by actually staying animated for an unbounded length 
<BR>
of time, and joined as tightly and solidly as two interlocked fractals with 
<BR>
someone with whom I am totally compatible.
<BR>
<P>If I become terminal in the near-term, I plan to toady-up to the whatever 
<BR>
bastard is leading the most scientific cryonics organization at the time and 
<BR>
do the best that I can to save my life by getting cryonically preserved.  If 
<BR>
I become terminal in the far-term, I expect that perfected suspended 
<BR>
animation will be available at a nearby major medical center and that all 
<BR>
the current cryonics organization will either be out of business or as 
<BR>
insignificant relative to the rest of the world as they are today.  Of 
<BR>
course as stated above, my highest priority is never to become
<BR>
terminal at all.
<BR>
<P>Again my thanks for you questions, it was refreshing to see someone on
<BR>
this list who is interested in reality rather than &quot;dreamality.&quot;
