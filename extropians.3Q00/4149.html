<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, the push by the &quot;progressives&quot; of the latter 19th century - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trust-busting, regulatory boards, etc., was actually a Satanic Pact, if ever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there was one.  In exchange for accepting state control of one's business - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is what one does when one incorporates (think of all the business 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulations, and all the bureacrats who feed off them) - one gets the .ltd 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stamp, and if you make a risky bet on your chemical plant (or nuclear 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processing facility) then you lose the company, but you personally walk 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scott free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Talk about socially irresponsible policy ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree wholeheartedly, though I would add to the history you cite
<BR>
that limitation of liability began much earlier as an English royal
<BR>
charter, according to my reading of R. Buckminster Fuller.  He claimed
<BR>
that it was a royal gift to indemnify the owners of ships against the
<BR>
risks of dangerous ocean voyages of exploration, trade or conquest
<BR>
conducted for the English Crown.  But I agree that the modern form of
<BR>
management of large corporate affairs is essentially a matter of
<BR>
becoming a private deputy of the state in many of its efforts.  In
<BR>
response to the question by &quot;Wei Dai&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:weidai@eskimo.com?Subject=Re:%20Bugs%20in%20free%20markets.&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009041644.MAA16130@panix3.panix.com&gt;">weidai@eskimo.com</A>&gt;:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; .. That is true, but what is your proposed alternative? Do you seriously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggest eliminating liability limitation for corporations? What about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the liability limitation represented by personal bankruptcies? ...
</EM><BR>
<P>I would propose doing away with these laws, as I would do away with
<BR>
all laws that do not respect force or the initiation of force, though
<BR>
this should be done in an intelligent manner, perhaps by phasing out
<BR>
the current regime.  I would prefer to rely on a system of privately
<BR>
produced law in private courts to determine standards of liability for
<BR>
owners of corporate equity, with no special exemptions granted except
<BR>
those that common law finds to be reasonable (obviously a day-to-day
<BR>
director ought to have different liability than a less active
<BR>
partner).
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this is all a side note to the original topic, and I'm not
<BR>
terribly interested in carrying on my half of a discussion or debate
<BR>
on the topic, so if anyone wishes to keep this topic alive, please be
<BR>
aware that I'm going to excuse myself from further participation.  I
<BR>
consider this topic to be well-worn stuff covered in the law and
<BR>
economics texts that Extropians frequently reference.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James
