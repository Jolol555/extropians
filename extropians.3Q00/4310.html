<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; Personally, while I’d be grateful to the ants for bringing me into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  existence, I doubt that I’d long be willing to enslave myself to them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the favor. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So you don't get along with your folks either? I personally don't discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything much deeper than the weather with mine. But I don't consider time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spent with them slavery.
</EM><BR>
<P>I get along fine with my folks, thanks.  And no, I don't consider time spent 
<BR>
with them slavery.  But then again they are not constantly asking me to 
<BR>
solve their problems, answer their questions or grant their wishes.  If they 
<BR>
did it would not be long before I limited my phone calls to every other 
<BR>
Mother's Day.

<P><EM>&gt;The road from human equivalence to Power is not instantaneous. Any initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;post-human AI will be an information-hound. We are full of information. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;upload us like so many glazed donuts. We will become it. It will be us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm.  I don't think so.  We will probably be unbelievably ignorant and 
<BR>
stupid to the AI.  But even if it did for some reason want to &quot;upload&quot; me, 
<BR>
until I get some details about what exactly that will entail, that is *not* 
<BR>
a comforting thought.
