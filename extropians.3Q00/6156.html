<P><EM> &gt; I do remember back that far.  Not remembering that is not a universal

I would not put any faith in fidelity of such supposed reminiscences,
<BR>
as (told in a recent paper which name I can't recall) adults tend to
<BR>
confabulate childhood memories. I've always suspected that much, but
<BR>
it's nice to see it proven -- hopefully, I haven't confabulated that
<BR>
paper, too ;)
<BR>
<P>Lucky modern kids, they can record every single minute of their lives,
<BR>
in principle. The technology is there, albeit still a bit expensive
<BR>
and cumbersome.

<EM> &gt; Nope.  The gap between human adult and SI is many orders of magnitude
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; greater.  But I don't see a sound argument here for assuming that the SI
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; could not understand in principle.

<P>Probably, for the same reason we can understand a virus, at least in
<BR>
principle, if knowing its and it's context's full molecular structure.
