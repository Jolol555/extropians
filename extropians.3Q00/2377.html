<EM>&gt; &gt;  Good, Everitt, then you are the man to ask:  there was a LL novel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  called Haunted Mesa.   My question: did Lamour write it?&gt;
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; It was almost a SF novel as a matter of fact.  It could be interpreted as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alternate reality or multiple universe...
</EM><BR>
<P>Reason: my wifes grandfather, her father and her brother all read every
<BR>
LAmour book, and loved them all, except they all hated Haunted Mesa.
<BR>
In an effort to be a part of the family, I tried to read a LAmour book,
<BR>
hated it.  Tried another, put it down, couldn't pick it back up.  Then
<BR>
I reasoned, if they hated Haunted Mesa, perhaps I would like it.  Well,
<BR>
it was silly, but far less so than the westerns.  Actually it had its moments,
<BR>
if one is in the mood for that sorta thing.  spike
