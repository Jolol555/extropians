<P><EM>&gt; 	i see no reason that an SI (the kind that eliezer envisions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyway) would experience anything remotely as anthropomorphic as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gratefulness. we are talking about an engineered transcendent mind,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a product of millions of years of evolution -- no parents, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; siblings, no competition, no breast-feeding.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the kicker - &quot;no competition&quot;!  In the past we had to
<BR>
compete to survive.  That is the law when there is no other more
<BR>
intelligent way to progress.  But once anyone or anything achieves the
<BR>
intelligence required to progress more intentionally than via
<BR>
&quot;survival of the fittest&quot; all the rules change drastically.  No longer
<BR>
are we competing, now we are communicating and sharing.  If anyone
<BR>
anywhere grows, learns, and so on and so forth, it is better for us
<BR>
all.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be concerned for lower life forms, for if we do
<BR>
nothing but destroy and consume them since we are superior, then we
<BR>
must expect the same fate as soon as we rune intoo any ET that is
<BR>
superior to ourselves.  What a lonely, hideous, and non diverse place
<BR>
this universe would be with only the single most advanced being having
<BR>
destroyed and consumed everything else.

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The road from human equivalence to Power is not instantaneous. Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initial post-human AI will be an information-hound. We are full of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information. It'll upload us like so many glazed donuts. We will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become it. It will be us.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, right on John!  Notice the difference here between
<BR>
&quot;consume and destroy&quot; and &quot;eat up via uploading.&quot;
