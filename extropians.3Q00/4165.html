<P>
Jason Joel Thompson indefatigably rejoined:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the false dichotomy I referred to earlier.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why do you call this equation a dichotomy?
<BR>
Dichotomy means dividing in two parts.
<BR>
The definition of reality as &quot;all that exists&quot; creates no dichotomy that I can
<BR>
detect.
<BR>
Rather, it proclaims the unitary nature of reality.
<BR>
If you imagine a dichotomy in this, then it is definitely a false dichotomy, and
<BR>
it is one that you have invented, not me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For instance, it's easy for me to say 'true' because the statement holds no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaning.  You're just switching titles-- instead of 'reality' you want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call it 'all that exists.'  Fine.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I'm not switching titles, I'm offering the most concise definition of
<BR>
reality that I can produce. If you think this amounts to switching titles (or
<BR>
more accurately, switching terms), then the dictionary is just a list of
<BR>
switched terms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do I believe that there is only &quot;one&quot; 'all that exists?'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To me the statement is meaningless.  How can you apply 'oneness' to such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concept?
</EM><BR>
<P>In (very basic) mathematics it's known as defining a set. The set of all that
<BR>
exists is what is meant by the term reality. Since there is only one such set in
<BR>
existence, it becomes unavoidable to apply &quot;oneness&quot; to this concept.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The reason I challenged Elierzer's original statement was not that I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saying, &quot;No, no, silly, there's actually SEVEN realities...&quot;  but rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I was questioning the concept of an absolute reality at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>OIC, so then it isn't that you disagree with the statement &quot;There is only one
<BR>
reality&quot; because you think there are multiple realities. You believe that there
<BR>
is no reality at all. But, you see, if there is no absolute reality, then there
<BR>
is no fact, state, or quality of being real or genuine, which is what absolute
<BR>
reality means. In that case, *you* are not real or genuine, and neither am I.
<BR>
So, in that case, you are not absolutely real and you do not absolutely exist.
<BR>
(This is elementary Cartesian logic.) I don't think your argument would stand in
<BR>
a court of law (or a court of common sense and reason, for that matter).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't see reality as a big, ubiquitous, tangible, static, all-encompassing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absolute, but rather as a relative, interpretive, intangible, dynamic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interaction.
</EM><BR>
<P>I notice that you use the singular indefinite article (&quot;a&quot; instead of &quot;some&quot;) to
<BR>
refer to your &quot;relative, interpretive, intangible, dynamic interaction.&quot; That
<BR>
tends to indicate that you see it as ONE relative, interpretive, intangible,
<BR>
dynamic interaction. Which in turn reinforces the statement that there is only
<BR>
one reality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It finds soldity as a mental contruct in the world of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind, but we cannot directly attribute greater 'existence' to it, as yet,
</EM><BR>
<P>Again you use the singular &quot;it&quot; as if it is some absolute substance that finds
<BR>
solidity in the mind. Whatever &quot;it&quot; may be, it appears that you do, indeed,
<BR>
believe it absolutely deserves the attention you give to it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; J.R., I recognize where you're trying to go with this, and I understand why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you accuse me of obstinancy.  You want reality to be the sum of all sets-- I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the feeling that you just want to shake me and say &quot;Yes, but 'reality'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; includes that too!&quot;  What you have to understand is that I am approaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the problem from an entirely different direction.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder if you have any inkling of how sophomoric your position appears to more
<BR>
mature minds on this list who have already been where you're coming from, and
<BR>
who have done all of these exercises which seem so new and different to you.
<BR>
It's not simply a matter of accusing you of obstinacy. All you need to do is
<BR>
pick up a dictionary of the English language to ascertain that what people mean
<BR>
by the term reality is straightforward and plain, and everyone knows what the
<BR>
word means. I understand very well the direction from which you approach this
<BR>
subject. It is not a problem at all. What you need to understand is that the
<BR>
more you try to wiggle out of admitting that there is only one reality, the
<BR>
farther you run from the topic at hand.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To me, belief in an external reality is the very human act of saying:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;there -is- something out there real making all of this stuff happen.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't directly see it yet, but we know it's there.&quot;  The belief system has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passing similarities to a religion.  And, of course, the adherents say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they -can- see reality directly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, puhleeeze! To refer to science and reason as a &quot;belief system&quot; indicates a
<BR>
level of hubris unbecoming of anyone who claims to have a hold on sanity. Your
<BR>
position reminds me of the Pope who refused to look through a telescope to view
<BR>
the moons of Jupiter on the grounds that whatever he might see there was surely
<BR>
the work of the devil.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And, truth be told, I'm not even saying that those people are wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, gee! Thank you *very* much! You're too generous.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may very well be an external reality.  It certainly seems like there is.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agree that we should act like there is.  So, unlike religious belief, belief
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in reality has real, tangible, demonstrable benefits that accrue to all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wrong. Acceptance of reality (not &quot;belief in reality&quot;), is where you need to
<BR>
start if you are ever to attain a balanced and integrated perspective. With
<BR>
experience, I suspect you will someday learn to recognize and acknowledge that
<BR>
the people who have sent rockets to the Moon, and split the atom, and discovered
<BR>
DNA, and accurately measured the age of dinosaur fossils, are people who accept
<BR>
the existence of one (&quot;external&quot;) reality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Essentially I have complete functional acceptance of the construct of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality, but maintain mental skeptism.  Currently this has no impact on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life other than to make for interesting discussion.  Despite what you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hinting at earlier, this doesn't result in me swerving out in traffic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Glad to hear that. Of course, to have a &quot;construct of reality&quot; you have to have
<BR>
something to construct it with. That's what we call absolute reality. It's real.
<BR>
Get used to it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can we agree to disagree now?
</EM><BR>
<P>No way! You must repeat after me:
<BR>
&quot;There is only one reality.&quot;
<BR>
Write it one hundred times every night before you go to bed.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what the
<BR>
Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced
<BR>
by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which
<BR>
states that this has already happened.
