<P>
<EM>&gt;   1. Are all the (measurable) dimensionless parameters that characterize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the physical universe calculable in principle or are some merely determined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by historical or quantum mechanical accident and uncalculable? Einstein put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it more crisply: did God have a choice in creating the universe? Imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Old One sitting at his control console, preparing to set off the Big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bang. &quot;How fast should I set the speed of light?&quot; &quot;How much charge should I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give this little speck called an electron?&quot; &quot;What value should I give to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Planck's constant, the parameter that determines the size of the tiny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packets -- the quanta -- in which energy shall be parceled?&quot; Was he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; randomly dashing off numbers to meet a deadline? Or do the values have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be what they are because of a deep, hidden logic?
</EM><BR>
<P>No one randomly dashed off numbers.
<BR>
The values do not have to be what they are if they are measured differently
<BR>
(using different units of measure.)
<BR>
For example, change the speed of light by re-calibrating seconds to the resonant
<BR>
frequency of a crystal other than quartz. (I know this because god told me so.
<BR>
&lt;smirk&gt;)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;   These kinds of questions come to a point with a conundrum involving a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mysterious number called alpha. If you square the charge of the electron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and then divide it by the speed of light times Planck's constant, all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dimensions (mass, time and distance) cancel out, yielding a so-called &quot;pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number&quot; -- alpha, which is just slightly over 1/137. But why is it not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; precisely 1/137 or some other value entirely? Physicists and even mystics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have tried in vain to explain why.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, of course a physicist can't explain it to a mystic, because mystics don't
<BR>
understand physics. Likewise, mystics can't explain it to physicists, because
<BR>
physicists don't understand mysticism.
<BR>
What we need here is a mystic physicist, one who understands both. Obviously
<BR>
mystic physicists could only explain it to each other. But they wouldn't need
<BR>
to, because as mystic physicists, they would already know it. Consequently,
<BR>
those who know wouldn't say, and the only ones who felt a need to say, would be
<BR>
the ones who didn't actually know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   2. How can quantum gravity help explain the origin of the universe?
</EM><BR>
<P>This requires a deep understanding of gravity (a very heavy subject).
<BR>
Black Holes collapse infinite space in infinitesimal time producing Big Bangs up
<BR>
the wazoo.
<BR>
So the multiverse (the sum of all universes) doesn't have an origin -- it has
<BR>
always been Big Banging away.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   3. What is the lifetime of the proton and how do we understand it?
</EM><BR>
<P>This one is easy, because brainwaves generate photons in the microtubules which
<BR>
connect the neurons of the human brain. Hold your head very still, close your
<BR>
eyes, take a deep breath, let it out slowly, don't think about anything at all,
<BR>
and in about 15 minutes you'll see the photons whirling around in there, and lo
<BR>
and behold! the little buggers last no longer than a flash in a hemorrhoidal
<BR>
forty-niner's gold pan at high noon. After that, they just kind of disintegrate
<BR>
into whatever. Although this happens in a matter of minutes, the exercise is so
<BR>
boring that it seems like a billion trillion trillion years or more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   4. Is nature supersymmetric, and if so, how is supersymmetry broken?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it's not supersymmetric, it's just normally symmetric. This is because the
<BR>
symetry of nature is equaled by the chaos of cybernetics in its out-of-control
<BR>
trajectory toward the Singularity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   5. Why does the universe appear to have one time and three space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dimensions?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, how would you like it if the universe had three time dimensions and one
<BR>
space dimension? That would make it rather difficult to keep the trains running
<BR>
on time wouldn't it? (Yes, I know. You wouldn't have to worry about the trains
<BR>
de-railing, but you wouldn't have anywhere for them to go either.)
<BR>
What I really want to know is why does the universe appear to move in five
<BR>
dimensions and rainbow colors come out of my stereo speakers and my head melt
<BR>
into the keyboard whenever I drop acid.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   6. Why does the cosmological constant have the value that it has? Is it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; zero and is it really constant?
</EM><BR>
<P>The cosmological constant used to have a value somewhat less than its present
<BR>
value. Like everything else, inflation has made it seem more valuable. No, it's
<BR>
not zero, and it's not constant, no matter what the government wants you to
<BR>
believe. The feds really have a tight hold on the media, because you just never
<BR>
hear about inflation anymore. (And Greenspan can't really do anything about it
<BR>
anyway.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   7. What are the fundamental degrees of freedom of M-theory (the theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whose low-energy limit is eleven-dimensional supergravity and that subsumes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the five consistent superstring theories) and does the theory describe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature?  [....] The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question now is, Which is more fundamental -- are strings made from branes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or vice versa? Or is there something else even more basic that no one has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought of yet? Finally, is any of this real, or is M theory just a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascinating mind game?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, none of this is real. M theory was devised by cunning social manipulators to
<BR>
distract cosmologists from the more important and relevant questions such as How
<BR>
to build a computer that can predict the stock market accurately. Strings and
<BR>
branes are actually devices which will be encrypted into e-cash (cyber money) to
<BR>
keep it from being counterfeited by greedy hackers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   8. What is the resolution of the black hole information paradox?
</EM><BR>
<P>Currently, it's 600 X 800 pixels, but with a bit of tinkering, you might expect
<BR>
as much as 1200 X 1600 (without flicker, if you have sufficient refresh rate on
<BR>
your monitor).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; what would happen if you dropped a copy of the Encyclopaedia
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Britannica down a black hole?
</EM><BR>
<P>Are we talking about a copy on a CD or the Presentation Edition? Well, it
<BR>
doesn't much matter, because in either case the information would come out the
<BR>
other side of the black hole as disinformation in a baby universe. The boffins
<BR>
of the black hole would probably get agitated by this reckless discharge of
<BR>
refuse, and they'd vigorously pursue you. Remember: Every litter bit hurts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   9. What physics explains the enormous disparity between the gravitational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scale and the typical mass scale of the elementary particles? In other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; words, why is gravity so much weaker than the other forces, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electromagnetism?
</EM><BR>
<P>As we all know, the Earth is a giant magnet. What most people don't know is that
<BR>
gravity actually plays no part in the mass scale of the elementary particles.
<BR>
You see, the whole universe sucks, and that's why enormous disparities exist
<BR>
everywhere, especially at the socio-economic level. So, it's not so much that
<BR>
gravity is weaker than the other forces so much as that the other forces all
<BR>
(kinda sort of) suck in unison. It's like one big ol' conspiracy of suck-ass
<BR>
forces conspiring to commit even more disparate enormities. Bother!
<BR>
Incidentally, those extra dimensional black holes are the real force behind
<BR>
gravity, and they do their best to keep the entire cosmos from being sucked into
<BR>
electromagnetic oblivion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   10. Can we quantitatively understand quark and gluon confinement in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quantum chromodynamics and the existence of a mass gap?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we can.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   11. (Question added in translation). Why is any of this important?
</EM><BR>
<P>These questions are important because they help us to understand that the
<BR>
universe has wider horizons than our theories can accommodate without making
<BR>
mysteries out of what we formerly thought made sense. Also, these questions keep
<BR>
us from building a computer that can accurately predict the future of the stock
<BR>
market, which would take too much of the fun out of being very rich. I know,
<BR>
because a wise old Turk once told me so.
