<EM>&gt; Under standard accounts, decisions are made by combining positions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on values and beliefs about facts.  One considers all the possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relevant states of the world, and beliefs about facts are about how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely each state is given each action, while positions on values
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are about how much one would like each state compared to the others.
</EM><BR>
<P>Classically, philosophers have used this division.  As Cicero wrote, &quot;de
<BR>
gustibus non est disputatum&quot;, there's no accounting for taste.  There's no
<BR>
use trying to persuade someone about matters of taste, and values can be
<BR>
thought of as just our personal taste when applied to ethical questions.
<BR>
<P>Sometimes, though, differences that appear to be on values are actually
<BR>
on implicit factual assumptions.  Someone may say that they just have
<BR>
an inherent dislike of the idea of being uploaded, and they would never
<BR>
support a future where that is commonplace.  This appears to be a matter
<BR>
of values.  However upon further discussion it may turn out that they
<BR>
are assuming that upload life would have certain qualities that it might
<BR>
not, such as absence of emotions or some kind of cold, logical quality
<BR>
to the world.  The apparent value difference is actually largely due to
<BR>
factual disagreements about the nature of the uploaded world.
<BR>
<P>Many of the areas where extropians are different from other people lie in
<BR>
scenarios that will be exotic and unfamiliar.  Concepts like uploading,
<BR>
singularity, AI, nanotech, intellectual and physical augmentation, will
<BR>
all be new to most people.  It may well be that an initial negative
<BR>
reaction to these proposals is due as much to questions of fact as to
<BR>
values.  With sufficient discussion and dialogue, it may be possible to
<BR>
overcome people's initial &quot;instinctive&quot; aversion to extropian scenarios.
<BR>
<P>Also, there seem to be different levels of values.  I feel that most
<BR>
people have a meta-value which encourages them to adopt values similar
<BR>
to those around them.  Over time, then, success in persuading people
<BR>
and in organizing them around a value system can lead to more people
<BR>
adopting that system.  So even a true difference in values is something
<BR>
that can be overcome, although I think different tactics must be used.
