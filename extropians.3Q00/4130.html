<P>
All this talk of &quot;humbots&quot;; horrible. If you had a human in the role, you'd
<BR>
probably want someone skilled; they might know the local area better than
<BR>
you, they might speak the local language better, or they might have at least
<BR>
some skill in the domain in which you are working (eg: the lab assistant
<BR>
example below).
<BR>
<P>I'd lean toward the name &quot;teleoperative&quot;, which connotes a professional,
<BR>
rather than a mindless slave. There'd need to be a code of ethics, similar
<BR>
to that of interpreters, of impartially handling interaction for the
<BR>
teleoperator, of confidentiality, all that stuff. For some tasks, you might
<BR>
get right down to the job of directing the teleoperator; maybe through a
<BR>
heads-up displayed arrow, which tells them which way to turn their head,
<BR>
maybe the buzzing mentioned below, whatever.
<BR>
<P>I imagine there would be some nice benefits of this to the teleoperative in
<BR>
some cases. For example, in an IT system administration environment, new
<BR>
graduates could work as teleoperatives for some of the best people in the
<BR>
world, giving them the chance to observe at extremely close proximity how to
<BR>
perform incredibly advanced tasks. The same could go for many fields.
<BR>
<P>The level of teleoperation required could vary substantially; call this the
<BR>
required Control Factor. A really high control factor would involve
<BR>
directing the teleoperative where to move their hands, head, feet, whatever.
<BR>
You'd need a highly skilled human teleoperative, who was used to the &quot;rig&quot;
<BR>
they wear, and who was trained to respond quickly and exactly. I imagine
<BR>
this could turn into a profession of sorts; you'd need a relatively fit
<BR>
person, agile, and attentive, who could pay attention to operator
<BR>
instructions without being distracted by the details of the task at hand,
<BR>
whilst still paying attention to personal safety. To get really good
<BR>
immersion as a teleoperator, you'd need a very skilled teleoperative, who
<BR>
would most likely charge you an arm and a leg. For a very physically
<BR>
oriented person, this would likely be a fairly demanding and satisfying job.
<BR>
<P><P>A mid-range control factor would be realtime direction, but at a higher
<BR>
level (&quot;please go the the corner of 43rd and fifth&quot;, or &quot;This guy is lying
<BR>
to us. Engage him in polite chit-chat, and I'll think about how to
<BR>
proceed&quot;). Mid-range control factor is where communications/negotiation
<BR>
professionals, conference level interpreters, and skilled actors would come
<BR>
into their own, being given general directions, and deciding on
<BR>
implementation details themselves, as their professional opinion dictates.
<BR>
This could often be much more like teamwork; often, you would be hiring
<BR>
skills which you don't possess yourself.
<BR>
<P>Low control factors might be entirely offline. You'd send a message to the
<BR>
company, &quot;Could you please get someone to pick up a box of chocolates from
<BR>
XYZ chocolate shop, and mail them to this address...&quot;. Least functional, but
<BR>
still often a useful service. This is probably available right now,
<BR>
depending on what you need; you just contact the appropriate service
<BR>
provider and tell them your requirements.
<BR>
<P>To even achieve decent mid-range control factors, we are going to need good
<BR>
wireless comms; bandwidth! In Australia, I know I can only get 9600bps over
<BR>
a mobile-phone link; I'm not sure what other technologies are available
<BR>
here. 9600bps is not enough. I think some newer, better data options are
<BR>
coming online soon; I'm going to keep an eye on that. What's the situation
<BR>
in the US? What sort of data rates are available? What's on the way? I think
<BR>
we really need realtime video to make this plausible; probably a way off.
<BR>
Although there are possibilities even without it; you've got relatively
<BR>
decent, affordable audio if you can get to 56K, so the teleoperative has to
<BR>
be your eyes. Still, there's a dedicated person on-site, working on your
<BR>
behalf; better than a conference call.
<BR>
<P>I'm interested in the state of wireless comms in the US, mainly. What's an
<BR>
affordable data rate (say using cellular networks), and what are the charges
<BR>
like? How about if money was no object; what kind of bandwidth could we put
<BR>
between a teleoperator on one side of the world, and a teleoperative on the
<BR>
other?

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ah...no, the original proposal was that there be a human operator on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the other end - and presumably one more skilled in the activity being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;done than the humbot (else, the humbot itself could just do the task
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without the expense of an operator) - thus leaving no nuances for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humbot to contribute.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
There's a lot of room between the two positions.  A professional lab
<BR>
assistant may be more competent than the research director at running
<BR>
certain equipment, but probably not in understanding the theory being
<BR>
tested.  One possible interface would involve the humbot seeing a heads-up
<BR>
picture of the actions he is to perform.  This would be handy when very
<BR>
precise direction is necessary, but probably very tiring to both parties.  I
<BR>
would think that a simpler sensory connection - one that sent a buzzing
<BR>
sensation to transducers, telling the humbot to swivel his or her head,
<BR>
simultaneously (with a second or so lag) with the controller turning his or
<BR>
her head for example, would provide a very realistic feeling of &quot;being
<BR>
there.&quot;  Some practice in this modality might lead to some very good
<BR>
teamwork, I suspect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Taking a different spin on this...what about seating-limited events?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Say, a legal proceeding or a government meeting where The Powers That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Be wish to limit public input.)  One person sits in, webcasting what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going on; a bunch of interested parties monitor the feed and have a chat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;session discussing what's going on.  Perhaps the person could even get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feedback as to what to do (say, if one of the viewers thinks of a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;retort to the Powers' &quot;respond to this complex question within five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seconds or we'll assume our point is made&quot;); either all the parties
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could have voice input, or there could be a moderator who is the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one who can directly give feedback to the attendee, and gives it based
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the chat session.
</EM><BR>
<P>Possibly, altho there I suspect you would want your smartest person on site,
<BR>
so they would also likely be the controller and decide what gets done.
<BR>
<P>As our bandwidth over the RF PDA/cellphone improves, I suspect that a lot of
<BR>
telepresence and tele-experience will become very popular.  Instead of
<BR>
calling 911 from under an avelanche, a hundred thousand thrill seekers will
<BR>
be there with you - placing bets on your survival.
