<EM>&gt;But then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this is all just distant futuristic fantasy, right? And we the public can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sit back and know that private and military AI research is many decades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; away from any such state of development.

<P>Nope. It's not fantasy at all. It's real. It's here. It's now.

Learn it, love it, live it.

<P>&quot;The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by
<BR>
the prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the
<BR>
government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be
<BR>
enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in
<BR>
this country is closely connected with this.&quot;
