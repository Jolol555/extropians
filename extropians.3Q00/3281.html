<P>&lt;&lt; My point with my comment was not everyone on this list should become a
<BR>
&nbsp;libertarian.  It was just a lament on the fact that almost everyone who has
<BR>
&nbsp;responded to me on the Kosovo War has been for it.  Not one other here has
<BR>
&nbsp;spoken against it -- at least, not to my recollection.  And at least two
<BR>
&nbsp;people have given it their thumbs up.  I find that rather strange because I
<BR>
&nbsp;bet on any other list, on this topic, I'd find people who vary on that. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Because if you like freedom and order, sometimes you have to get the bad 
<BR>
guys. And, yes, sometimes there are really predatory criminal states.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Trying selling your wares in Saudi Arabia without a license.  Try also doing
</EM><BR>
things like having sex with who you want to and let the law there know about
<BR>
it.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>But Saudi tends to be an intensive capitalist state-just not the capitalism 
<BR>
of the Scottish Enlightenment and as you have pointed out-little freedom. 
<BR>
Singapore has more freedoms, yet it too is tightly controlled and capitalist. 
<BR>
Pinochet's Chile' was capitalist, yet also repressive. My point is that the 
<BR>
pillar of Libertarianism-economic libertarianism, if you will, is capitalism. 
<BR>
And it appears as if its not axiomatically producing freedom.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; My examples would be Minsky, Moravec, Tipler, et al.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then follow them.  No need to think or discuss.  After all, they have it all
<BR>
worked out.  Just read and agree, right?:)  &lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Hey! I could do a lot worse then those three. ;-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Don't you think that there will be a transitional period, as I hint at in my
</EM><BR>
parenthetic comment?  I don't want to perfect tyranny then hope it backs
<BR>
down once it has even greater levels of technology at its disposal, which is
<BR>
why I'm speaking out against the Kosovo War and other such interventions,
<BR>
especially since the transition will probably take place here in the West.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!&lt;&lt;

<P>First I feel that nanotech as envisioned by Drexler will happen decades later 
<BR>
then we desire and will not be gradualistic, but will become as pervasive as 
<BR>
the telephone became in the early 20th century-an explosion. I am more in 
<BR>
line with Moravec's thinking that work might disappear, not only because of 
<BR>
nanotech, but large-scale robotics, as homo sapien becomes stock holders 
<BR>
living off dividends, as the robots labor.
