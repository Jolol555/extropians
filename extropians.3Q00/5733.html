<P><EM>&gt; I don't see any rational reason for being nice to those who can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reciprocate. (Of course I'm still being nice, I'm only human).
</EM><BR>
<P>Aha! Now you've explained in one sentence why I should modify my position on
<BR>
friendly AIs.
<BR>
If we expect AIs to want to be friendly toward us, then we'll need to assure the
<BR>
AIs that we've done all that's humanly (and inhumanly) possible to make their
<BR>
lives the wonderfully pleasant experience that they know. IOW, we'll have to
<BR>
keep the AIs happy, and let them know that we are responsible for their
<BR>
happiness. They'll love us for making them happy.
<BR>
<P>It makes me happy to think that things could turn out so synergistic in a
<BR>
co-evolutionary way.
