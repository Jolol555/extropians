</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; in one basket, I think we should also have some solutions that fail-safe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; Some of us sentients should live in habitats that are not dependent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; advanced technology.  That come with a biosphere that is capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; sustaining organic, sentient life without use of technology.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How on earth (or off) would you do that?  There is no place on earth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that is not vulnerable to natural or manmade catastrophe.  We don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Vingean bobble fields after all.  And there is no place off of earth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that supports a human compatible biosphere without the use of LOTS of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology.  So I am having trouble understanding what was meant.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It will take a lot of tech to maintain an human supportive atmosphere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and temperature on Mars even with nanotech.  And what is this hangup on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human (as we now know them) life support anyway?  I would rather be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to morph my body or better still design one I could &quot;step into&quot; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;best suits the environment and needs at hand.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me try again.
<BR>
<P>I think life and sentience are great.  I don't know if there's a purpose to the 
<BR>
universe, but if there is, I bet life and sentience are key to it.  (And if
<BR>
there isn't a purpose, then by-gum we'll invent one!  How about cheese?)
<BR>
<P>I want to see us spread out into the universe in such a way as to reduce to an
<BR>
absolute minimum the risk of total extinction of sentient life.
<BR>
<P>There are three approaches to this, and they are not mutually exclusive:  
<BR>
Diversity, omnipresence, and adaptability.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see sentient life everywhere, with lots of variations in form and
<BR>
strategy.  Organic, inorganic, hybrid, unmodified original stock, space-faring,
<BR>
planet-bound, technology-based, technology-independent, fixed form, and
<BR>
adaptive.
<BR>
<P>While we're building our high-tech solutions, let's either try to design them
<BR>
so that they cannot fail, or so that if they fail, we still survive, or make 
<BR>
sure that there are some sentients that are not dependent on them.
<BR>
<P>By living in environments that require minimal tech to survive, like being an 
<BR>
old-style sentient on an old-style planet.  Or by terraforming a world in a way 
<BR>
that requires no upkeep for millions of years.  Or by modifying sentient bodies 
<BR>
to survive without technological assistance.  Or by keeping the technology, but 
<BR>
building massive fault-tolerance and repair into it or into us. 
<BR>
<P>Or doing all of these, and more, at the same time.
<BR>
<P>In other words, let's not turn the universe into a single, borg monoculture 
<BR>
running Windows 2035.  (Instead of heat death or proton decay, the universe
<BR>
will end with a blue screen.)
