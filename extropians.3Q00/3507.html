Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;BACKGROUND: Policosanol is a new cholesterol lowering agent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;derived from sugar cane. AIM: To compare the cholesterol lowering efficacy of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol with HMG CoA inhibitors. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients with a LDL cholesterol over 160 mg/dl were studied. If, after 6
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks of diet, cholesterol persisted elevated, they were doubly blind
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;randomized to receive policosanol 10 mg/day (55 patients),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lovastatin 20 mg/day (26 patients) or simvastatin 10 mg/day (25 patients).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Serum cholesterol was measured again after 8 weeks of therapy. RESULTS:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Initial demographic and laboratory data were similar among treatment groups.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A 24% LDL cholesterol reduction was obtained with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol, compared with a 22% reduction with lovastatin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and a 15% reduction with simvastatin. HDL cholesterol significantly increased
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in patients on policosanol and did not change in the other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;treatment groups. Adverse effects of policosanol were mild
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and unspecific. No changes in hepatic enzymes were observed. CONCLUSIONS:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Policosanol is a safe and effective cholesterol reducing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;agent.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION: This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tolerability of policosanol, a new cholesterol-lowering
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drug, in patients with type II hypercholesterolemia and additional coronary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After 5 weeks of a standard step-1
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lipid-lowering diet, 437 patients were randomized to receive, under
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;double-blind conditions, 5 mg policosanol or placebo once a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;day with the evening meal for 12 weeks and 10 mg policosanol
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or placebo for the next 12 weeks. RESULTS: Both groups were similar at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;randomization. Policosanol (5 and 10 mg/day) significantly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reduced (P &lt; .001) serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (18.2% and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;25.6%, respectively) and cholesterol (13.0% and 17.4%), and it significantly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;raised (P &lt; .01) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (15.5% and 28.4%).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Triglycerides remained unchanged after the first 12 weeks and lowered
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly (5.2%; P &lt; .01) at study completion.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Policosanol was safe and well tolerated, and no drug-related
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disturbances were observed. Two male patients who received placebo died
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;during the study--one because of a myocardial infarction and the other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;because of a cardiac arrest that occurred during a surgical intervention.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 11 serious adverse events (5.1%) in 10 patients who received
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;placebo (4.6%), 7 of which were vascular, compared with no serious adverse
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;events reported in patients receiving policosanol (P &lt; .01).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSIONS: Subjects in the group treated with policosanol
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;did not have serious adverse events during the 24-week study. This study
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shows that policosanol is effective, safe, and well
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tolerated in patients with hypercholesterolemia and concomitant coronary risk
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;factors.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol, a new cholesterol-lowering drug with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;concomitant antiplatelet effects, in patients with intermittent claudication.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After a baseline period of 6 weeks, 62 patients were randomized to receive,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;under double-blind conditions, either placebo (31 patients) or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol (31), 10 mg twice daily. Walking distances in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/hr, slope 10 degrees) were assessed before
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and after 6 months of treatment. Both groups were similar at randomization.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Policosanol increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) the initial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;claudication distance from 132.5+/-13.5 m (baseline) to 205.7+/-36.3 m (after
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;therapy) and the absolute claudication distance (p&lt;0.0001) from 229.5+/-22.0
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;m to 365.4+/-46.9 m; meanwhile both variables remained unchanged in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;placebo group (p&lt;0.05). The reduction of lower limb symptoms showed a greater
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;benefit in the policosanol group. There was no significant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;change in either group in the ankle/arm pressure ratio. The treatment was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;well tolerated. There were 10 discontinuations (seven placebo, three
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol) from the study. Six withdrawals occurred
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;because of adverse events (AE); all were in placebo patients. There were five
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;serious vascular AEs in the placebo group but none in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol group (p&lt;0.05). Overall, 12/31 (38.7%) placebo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;patients and 3/31 (9.7%) policosanol patients experienced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;AEs after randomization, which showed a lesser incidence of AEs in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol group (p&lt;0.01). The present study demonstrates a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;beneficial effect of policosanol in patients with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intermittent claudication.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect of policosanol on intimal thickening in rabbit cuffed

&nbsp;&nbsp;carotid artery.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We studied the effect of policosanol on smooth muscle cell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;proliferation in the cuffed carotid artery of the rabbit.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Policosanol is a mixture of higher aliphatic primary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;alcohols isolated from sugar cane wax, with cholesterol lowering effects
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;proved in experimental models and patients with type II hypercholesterolemia.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It acts by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. The positioning of a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nonocclusive silicone collar around the rabbit carotid artery results in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;formation of a neointima. We wished to determine whether
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol orally administered prevented intimal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thickening. Collars were placed around the left carotid for 15 days. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;contralateral artery was sham operated. We included three experimental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;groups: a control received vehicle and two others
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol at 5 and 25 mg Kg until sacrificed. Samples of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;arteries were examined by light and electron microscopy. To evaluate intimal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thickening the cross-sectional area of intima and media were measured.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Neointima was significantly reduced in policosanol-treated
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;animals compared with controls. The smooth muscle cell proliferation was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;studied by the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;antigen and a significant reduction was observed in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol treated rabbits. It is concluded that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol has a protective effect on the neointima
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;formation in this experimental model.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This study examined the effects of long-term lipid-lowering therapy with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol on the clinical evolution, and exercise-ECG
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;testing responses of 45 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with myocardial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ischemia, documented by exercise 201T1-myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an overall randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, made for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;different test endpoints. Fifteen patients were treated with 5 mg of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol twice daily; another 15 patients were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;administered the same drug dose plus 125 mg aspirin; and the other 15
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;patients received placebo plus equal aspirin dose. They were followed for 20
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;months, previous baseline observations, with treadmill exercise-ECG, besides
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;serum lipid test. Beneficial changes on proportions among the 2
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol groups and the placebo group, showed an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increment on functional capacity class, a decrement on rest and exercise
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;angina, and a significant decrease in cardiac events, and in ischemic ST
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;segment response, especially in the policosanol plus aspirin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;group (p = 0.05, X2(2df) = 5.8; p = 0.04, p = 0.02; Fisher). After treatment,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sets of mean changes revealed an increase on maximum oxygen uptake, and a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;decline on double product simultaneously in both policosanol
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;groups (p &lt; or = 0.02, p &lt; or = 0.002; Pillais, Hotellings' T2), while the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;placebo group was impaired. Aerobic functional capacity percent showed an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increment in policosanol groups (p &lt; or = 0.05, paired T).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lipid levels improved as other endpoints already reported. A supposed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ergogenic effect of octacosanol, policosanol's main active
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;compound, was not detected with this design. These results show that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;policosanol-treated CHD patients improved clinical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evolution, and exercise-ECG responses, owing to the amelioration of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;myocardial ischemia, even more when administered with aspirin.
