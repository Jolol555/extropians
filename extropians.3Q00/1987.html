<P>Ack!  Hideous spelling mistake in the title due to excited anti-IP-zealot
<BR>
reporter.  (Now corrected.)
<BR>
<P>I've been thinking about doing something similar for a while now.  A few
<BR>
thoughts,
<BR>
<P>- As far as I can tell the payment is not variable.  I've payed £2 for books
<BR>
I'd happily pay £40 for.  I know people who've had their life changed by a
<BR>
book, how much is that worth?
<BR>
<P>- Payment needs to be easy.  The hassle of signing up with Amazon and
<BR>
entering credit card details is *way* too much for a buck.
<BR>
<P>- King's using a system whereby if 75% of his readers pay, he'll write the
<BR>
next episode.  I think this is at odds with the real beauty of this scheme
<BR>
because it relies on being able to track the downloads and thus restricts
<BR>
redistribution.
<BR>
<P>- People that pay but don't get anything in return due to the lack of
<BR>
interest are going to be pissed off, this might be a disincentive,
<BR>
especially when dealing with larger sums of money.
<BR>
<P>What I want to do is this: Create a computer RPG (the full-on 3D affair; I'm
<BR>
part computer graphics programming geek) and sell it per episode on a pledge
<BR>
basis.  The payment system would be included in the software, so at the
<BR>
cliff hanger ending of episode one you'd see &quot;Want more?  Pledge now!&quot;  The
<BR>
pledges would only be collected when enough money had been taken (one of the
<BR>
problems here is in informing customers how much money is needed, and not
<BR>
creating disincentives to continue paying).  (Note: At a recent game
<BR>
developers conference it was mentioned that most people only ever play the
<BR>
first 10% of the games they buy.  This could mean that the pledge model
<BR>
would not work, or it could mean that under the current model developers are
<BR>
more worried about how a game looks on the box than how it actually plays.)
<BR>
Keeping interest for the lengthy (and expensive) development period of a
<BR>
game might be a challenge, possibly an on-line component of the game could
<BR>
be used.  The entire game - including artwork - would be released under the
<BR>
GPL and derivative works would be encouraged (obviously the copyright - with
<BR>
a link to the payment system - would have to be included).
<BR>
<P>I'll wait to see what happens with King.
<BR>
