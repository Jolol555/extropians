This is moving a discussion begun on exi-east, questioning why Libertarians
<BR>
would want to counterprotest against the anti-WTO protesters that are going to
<BR>
be going on this weekend at the GOP convention in Philladelphis (NOTE: Chris
<BR>
Fedeli is putting together a counter protest along with folks from the
<BR>
Competetive Enterprise Institute, and is looking for help):

<EM>&gt; Gosh, last time I looked, the WTO wasn't a big booster of these. They're

<EM>&gt; into seriously regulated (by the WTO of course) trade and immigration.
</EM><BR>
<P>The 'regulation' of trade by the WTO is only in limiting the regulation that
<BR>
signor states can enact or enforce, limiting tariffs and ruling against trade
<BR>
war inciting activities, like protectionism. The WTO enforces international laws
<BR>
that mandate the de-regulation of trade between nations.

<EM>&gt; &gt;and anti-fake science inspired environmental activism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What about environmental activism inspired by good science? Biodiversity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; depletion and GM foods are legitimate topics of debate by actual live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientists *and* non-scientist citizens. I've read many of the tracks put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out by various groups opposing GM, for instance, and almost all of them are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calling not for an outright ban on these products, but for more public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disclosure and stronger peer review. How is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-libertarian/extropian? (I see how calls for stronger immediate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulation are, but not the calls for fair product labeling and open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protocols).
</EM><BR>
<P>The public fronts of protest groups will frequently paint themselves as
<BR>
moderate, reasonable individuals, and the enemy as extremist nutjobs who are
<BR>
unwilling to compromise (compromise being defined as the bad guys giving in on
<BR>
every one of the 'good guys' points). I've seen the same thing on the
<BR>
gun-control front, Jeff, and its the same old song and dance. Their idea of
<BR>
'strong' peer review is that the anti-GM scientists should be given seats on the
<BR>
juries of academic journals so they can vote down and protest the publishing of
<BR>
any studies on Genetic engineering work. Their idea of science has been
<BR>
repeatedly shown as a) only accepting that work that fit their prejudices, and
<BR>
b) consistently WRONG theories and conclusions. My cousin's work in Antarctica
<BR>
last year proved that the leftist theories of cataclysmic collapse of the
<BR>
Antarctic Ice Cap being promulgated by scientists at the University of
<BR>
Washington were totally bogus, that the ice cap has been stable for 22 million
<BR>
years, since the last major asteroid triggered extinction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and anti-government environmental regulation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, the WTO is a big believer in this. If by 'government' one means the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; WTO. So why oppose an anti-WTO group if you're motivated primarily by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libertarianism? Seems to me that protesting the corrupt two-party system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that encourages cronyism and corporatism in government would be more to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point.
</EM><BR>
<P>The WTO, as it administers the GATT treaty, is very silent on environmental
<BR>
issues that are restricted within a single country. The only environmental
<BR>
mandates in GATT are to species that inhabit or migrate through two or more
<BR>
national ecologies. Anti-WTO protesters want to use the next round of GATT
<BR>
negotiations to force Asian, 3rd world, and developing nations to adopt
<BR>
environmental protection, anti-GM, workplace safety, and minimum wage/union
<BR>
rights laws that are standard in western industrialized nations. This is the
<BR>
primary reason why the WTO reps in Seattle could not agree on even beginning the
<BR>
next round of GATT negotiations, because the reps from less 'westernized'
<BR>
nations saw the existence of the protest as some sort of subterfuge by Clinton
<BR>
and the western socialist leaders to try to force these issues onto the agenda
<BR>
for the next round of negotiations. By refusing to even agree to begin the next
<BR>
round, they were able to keep the issues off the table, and the protesters
<BR>
actually, in reality, lost more than they gained.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Oh, and they are against  economic or real sabotage of private enterprise R&amp;D.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Protest &lt;&gt; sabotage, as you are undoubtably aware.
</EM><BR>
<P>No I'm not. Sabotage is low intensity terrorist/insurgency warfare, i.e.
<BR>
diplomacy by other means. Protest is propaganda warfare.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Although there certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were acts of vandalism in Seattle, they barely compared to the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; episodes of state-sponsored police violence or even to the mayhem found at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a typical World Cup event. Shall we oppose soccer as an anti-libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sport?
</EM><BR>
<P>Please be realistic. The people who are active in organizing and training people
<BR>
for these protests are the very same people involved in anti-GM and animal
<BR>
rights sabotage black ops. The OAS meeting in Windsor, Ontario proved this,
<BR>
where the FBI supplied the Canadian border cops with lists of all people
<BR>
arrested in leftist political protests or sabotage operations in the US and
<BR>
convicted of misdemeanors or higher more serious crimes for sabotage, vandalism,
<BR>
or other such acts.  The Canadians arrested literally hundreds of such convicts
<BR>
at the border and kept them in detention until after the OAS meeting ended.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I still fail to see how libertarianism and/or extropianism would be served
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by opposing anti-WTO protests.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope you are beginning to get an idea.
