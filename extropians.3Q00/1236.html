<EM>&gt;	Do you want to be reanimated as (check one):

<EM>&gt;		[] A biological human

</EM><BR>
<P><P>Can't be reanimated as a biological human.  The reentry process will
<BR>
require  a neuro patients to add on a prosthetic body or cloned body (or
<BR>
whatever will come on line technologically at that time).  So, it would
<BR>
have to be a post-biological transhuman.  As for whole body patients, they
<BR>
too will need some non-biological augmentations and therefore will not be a
<BR>
biological human.
<BR>
<P>But, to answer your question, I want a post-biological transport vehicle
<BR>
that changes appearance and form, and I also want aspects of my self to be
<BR>
available for uploading, and I want to be superintelligent.  I also would
<BR>
like to have sub-personalities available and a smart backup system.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Actually, if you want to get technical about it, what the bracelet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should say is:  &quot;Please upload and upgrade immediately, if it is clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and unambiguous (99%+) that I would come to that conclusion if I knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the facts.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And you don't need a bracelet; we'll just read it out of your neurons.
</EM><BR>
<P>My bracelet is on my kitchen table.  I would really like to have an implant
<BR>
on my wrist that flashes neon colors and emits a loud alarm if I need to
<BR>
get immediate medical care and suspension.   A problem with the bracelet or
<BR>
necklace is that there are some personnel in emergency rooms that don't
<BR>
look at the bracelets/necklaces while treating a patient.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So... are you &quot;wearing&quot; your Other Bracelet?
</EM><BR>
<P>Waiting for you to design it Eliezer.
