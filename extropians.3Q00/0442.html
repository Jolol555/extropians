<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hitler and the Nazi's were &quot;Christian&quot; to the extent it was a cloak they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wore to ingratiate themselves with the public and consolidate their power.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This was not the first time this was done in history!  Later, the Christian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trappings were phased out for an approach of Nazism as a cult of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personality religion with Hitler as the savior.  I have read stories of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nazi youth party members actually being taught to pray to Hitler.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know how much of this was actually instituted or how much of it was 
<BR>
unrealized party platform, but they also wanted to replace crosses in 
<BR>
churches with swastikas, and to replace the bible with mein kamph.
<BR>
Wasn't hitler himself into Norse gods and ancient german paganism? I don't 
<BR>
remember where I heard that exactly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Equating Nazism with Christianity OR atheism is insulting.  Should we 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compare them to something biological... like cancer?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;best regards,
</EM><BR>
