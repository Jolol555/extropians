</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;DINOSAURS were not wiped out by a meteorite or a planetary catastrophe but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by a serious flatulence problem, according to a Chinese news report. The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;report, cited last week by BBC News Online, comes from the China Youth 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Daily. In 1991 Associated Press attributed the idea to geochemist Simon 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Brassell; this time it's an unnamed French scientist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem was apparently the amount of methane expelled by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dinosaurs--enough to blast a hole in the ozone layer. This in turn damaged 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terrestrial vegetation and caused a food shortage which ended the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dinosaurs' reign.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;The animals, weighing from 80 to 100 tonnes, would eat on average between 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;130 and 260 kilos of food every day. They would fart non-stop,&quot; the Chinese 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paper tells its surprised readers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(from the New Scientist)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Actually, this sounds very much like a similar story reported in the L.A. 
<BR>
Times or O.C. Register recently.  However, the gist of what I suspect to 
<BR>
have been the original story was that the methane/water crystals that exist 
<BR>
at the bottom of much of the ocean, in some cases in layers estimated to be 
<BR>
hundreds of feet thick, started sublimating either as the ocean levels 
<BR>
dropped during some mini-ice-age cycle due to a drop in the extreme pressure 
<BR>
required to keep them in crystal form, or alternatively as the ocean temps 
<BR>
rose during a hot cycle.  Either way, this process proceeded into a runaway 
<BR>
global catastrophe which had the result you mentioned.
<BR>
<P>The methane crytals really are there, in vast abundance, but were only 
<BR>
fairly recently identified as such, because it's hard to get them to the 
<BR>
surface intact.  There has been a lot of speculation since their discovery 
<BR>
that they might serve as a useful energy supply in the near future, 
<BR>
comparable in total ergs to natural gas, but there is also the worry that 
<BR>
the layers might not be all that stable...
<BR>
<P>Of course, an asteroid could also have been a triggering agent in a methane 
<BR>
catatastrophe.  However, it seems unlikely to me that any such combination 
<BR>
of events could have wiped out every single species of dinosaur.  I proposed 
<BR>
a systemic cause that could account for the universal demise about twenty 
<BR>
years ago, and have yet to hear a reason why it couldn't be true.
