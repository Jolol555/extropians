<EM>&gt;&gt;... (Unless such labeling is merely to increase the asking price for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;stuff.)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;which begs the question, why would we want to label them anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at all? people value some objects/designs and not others ... ideally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because of some quality of these objects/designs and not because they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;placed into some category. to emphasize such a category is to say that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matters in some way. but really, if someone actually purchases some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;object/design solely because they think it's &quot;art,&quot; then they have too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much money anyway and i can't pretend to sympathize.
</EM><BR>
<P>- -x,
<BR>
<P>Thanks for you insight! I enjoy a slice of pretense pie.
<BR>
<P>Pretentious idiots with no taste and too much money: A snooty gallery
<BR>
owner's dream clients. Which once again proves that there's no accounting
<BR>
for taste, but those having no taste at all, are buyers you can bank on.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if computer-generated 'art' is influening the market trend that's
<BR>
begun to focus more on three-dimension objects, like one-of-a-kind
<BR>
furniture and fiber pieces, rather than pictures. Magazines like 'Amercian
<BR>
Style' (very craft oriented) and 'Art and Antiques' (the serious
<BR>
collector's bible), once art worlds apart, now have obvious similarities.
<BR>
<P>Having said that, I'll have to check out the stuff/art.
