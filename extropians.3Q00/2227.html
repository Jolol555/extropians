Sheesh, I had a horrible stage of it in early puberty. I thought the
<BR>
Talisman was cool, (good guy reading) going back and forth from the modern
<BR>
world into a primitive warrior world. It was a dual time journey that led
<BR>
completely different lives. Yes, the Backman Files, Children of the Corn,
<BR>
Carrie, Salems Lot, It, Cujo,
<BR>
Pet Semetary (no, it's not spelled wrong), Maximum Overdrive, (was the name
<BR>
of the book that had the adapted movie Stand by Me called Different
<BR>
Seasons?), The Dead Zone (cool movie with Christopher Walken -who I dig- but
<BR>
the movie's ending came out different than the book, just like Cujo) Night
<BR>
Shift, Skeleton Crew, I hated the Gunslinger (Louis L'amour came to mind,
<BR>
yuck) then there was the one that took place entirely in a room that a woman
<BR>
was tied up in, Gerald's Game.(can you say sexual tension?) Gerald was also
<BR>
the name of that kid in Pet Semetery. I noticed in a lot of his books he
<BR>
would have some one reading a book he previously wrote in real life or
<BR>
something like that. And dang, Misery made a good movie. The Shawshank
<BR>
Redemption went in a different direction than the stereotype King (sort of
<BR>
like Stand by Me had), a banker convicted of murders he didn't commit and a
<BR>
friendship that meets at the end.Storm of the Century was cool, a town get's
<BR>
snowed in and cut off from the rest of the world via storm, and have to come
<BR>
together and pick one of their own communities children to sacrifice for
<BR>
some odd murderous being. (it was interesting to see how they decided to do
<BR>
that, this was serious tension)
<BR>
The Golden Years was a cool King movie for us Science freaks, the chick from
<BR>
X-files was in it, she was blonde and better looking in that role, a lot
<BR>
hotter than X-files portrays her. There's some chemical age messin' stuff in
<BR>
that flick, or something like that. The movie Cat's Eye, with the 3 mini
<BR>
movies in it, one had a strange little dwarf, the other (stood out most) had
<BR>
a stop smoking group, that these people joined, and would be intensely
<BR>
watched, and severely punished, when they snuck a cig in! The Shining, cabin
<BR>
fever galore! Thinner, screw it, don't diet! The Tommyknockers, read it, but
<BR>
I don't remember it.
<BR>
I haven't read his stuff in such a long time, but teenager-hood sticks. I
<BR>
did buy some of his newer books, started them, and set them down to reach
<BR>
over for oh, I don't know let's say, CREATE/RECREATE: The 3rd Millennial
<BR>
Culture, or my fav, Nanosystems or perhaps the new Nanomedicine.....etc.
<BR>
etc....
<BR>
Okay, okay, I'll stiffle now....(did I just type all of this waste of
<BR>
psychobabble?)
<BR>
By the way, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME GETTING HIS CD-ROM GAME F-13, it's weak!!!
<BR>
You would have thought, that the master of horror, the boogey man himself,
<BR>
would have come up with something better than a 80's arcade version of that
<BR>
fair game, where you take the big foam hammer and hit the chipmunk heads!
<BR>
G~
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nope...I think I read &quot;the stand'....&quot;children of the corn&quot;&lt;is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right?&gt;...&quot;it&quot; and possible some of the Bachman Files....about that time I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gave up on king....
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Did you read the Talisman?
