<EM>&gt; One problem is that not only government and

<EM>&gt; I remember when I went into a jewelry store where the proprietor wore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a sidearm.  It was pretty scary knowing he could pull out his gun and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoot me dead at any time.  I didn't go back.

<P><P>This is an irrational fear.  When you walk down a sidewalk, any one of the
<BR>
drivers passing by could turn their wheel and run you over.  And it
<BR>
happens, with intent no less, relatively often.  Do you never leave the
<BR>
house?
<BR>
<P>For that matter, there are more than a few people walking around that
<BR>
could kill you as quickly with their bare hands as they could with a gun. 
<BR>
The intent of the individual has far more bearing on your personal safety
<BR>
than any tools they may have on their person.
