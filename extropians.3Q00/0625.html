<P><EM>&gt;To the contrary, it is quite conceivable that a series of environmental 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fluctuations could wipe out a long-lived species, while a short-lived one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would survive.  [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Let's imagine a species - of bacteria, for example - that can only reproduce 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;within a narrow temperature range, although it can survive quite well over a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much broader range.  Within this species, however, there are always a few 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mutants, recessive genes, etc., for other temperature ranges scattered 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;around.

<BR>
<P>An interesting post, which led me to consider an issue I've never seen
<BR>
discussed in the literature (although this is doubtless due to my
<BR>
ignorance): selective differentials from secular variations in sunlight,
<BR>
temperature etc and their impact on creatures with variant breeding and
<BR>
mortality patterns.
<BR>
<P>I've argued elsewhere that there's evidence for moderate cycles in climate
<BR>
that are possibly driven by solar energy dynamics (most notably marked by
<BR>
the sunspot cycle) and long Milankovic and other oscillations in the
<BR>
Earth's orbit and inclination, etc. These cycles exceed the lifespans of
<BR>
many small critters, and even human generations only barely encompass the
<BR>
shorter ones. 
<BR>
<P>If this has any bearing upon which phenotypes are best adapted at any given
<BR>
slice across the cycles, I can imagine that critters which store food might
<BR>
tend to live longer than those which don't; long-distance north-south
<BR>
migratory beasties might live longer than others of the same metabolic
<BR>
indices; and fish, lobsters or other critters in the stabilised environment
<BR>
of the sea might produce some species that escape mortality entirely (as
<BR>
Joao was suggesting, I think).
