<EM>&gt; &gt; For instance, I'd love to be able to rent a robot body for the day from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; robot-rental dealer (robo-hurtz), and be able to turn up to my US 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clients
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and actually interact with them, whilst tucked in my little hidey-hole 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Melbourne. I'd pay money for that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

Why waste all that money?  You could hire a real, live human being to carry 
<BR>
around an RF linked webcam - or two, for binocular vision - and microphones. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fairly simple switching system, you could give them instructions, 
<BR>
or even incorporate a joystick, mouse, or touchpad controller that would use 
<BR>
various input modalities - buzzers, tones, or actual vocal interpretations - 
<BR>
to instruct them how to move, what to look towards, etc.
<BR>
<P>Your voice would either be a speaker mounted as close to the person's mouth 
<BR>
as possible - probably low neck area, or their voice as an interpreter, with 
<BR>
you hearing and/or reading auto-translation via voice recognition and 
<BR>
translation software.  A further check on accuracy could be provided via a 
<BR>
heads-up display for your telepersona operator, who would see the original 
<BR>
voice signal looping back as a retranslation into their own language.
<BR>
<P>At shows like CES or COMDEX, there are companies that provide professional 
<BR>
generic salespersons to man your booth, which is especially handy for 
<BR>
foreign companies that may not have very many good English speakers 
<BR>
available.  This would be a natural extension of their services.
<BR>
<P>(I first suggested this I think when the Indy came out with decent built-in 
<BR>
voice recognition.  My idea then was to take someone who didn't speak the 
<BR>
language being used, take the voice input from other speakers in a 
<BR>
conversation, run it through one of the smarter versions of Ractor, and then 
<BR>
send the Ractor output back into an earphone of the humbot, who would be 
<BR>
repeating it verbatim, not speaking the language.  I thought it would be 
<BR>
interesting to see how long it took the other members of the conversation to 
<BR>
notice something odd in this variation on the Turing test.)
