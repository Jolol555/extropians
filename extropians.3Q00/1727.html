<P>
Sounds simple enough, it's a network sniffer that hackers have used on
<BR>
promiscuous interfaces for years.
<BR>
<P>PGP or other e-mail encryption programs exist.  Any encryption program without
<BR>
backdoor would generate e-mail completely opaque to any sniffer besides mail
<BR>
destination header information.  There exist multiple ways to divert mail thus
<BR>
assigning it false or intermediary destination headers except for the very last
<BR>
hop to the recipient.
<BR>
<P>Basically, Carnivore is ineffective against any sophisiticated user that is
<BR>
trying to cover their tracks, and is only effective agaisnt all the innocents.
<BR>
It's equivalent to a publicized traffic stop of every car on each interstate
<BR>
through a town, while not stopping any cars that take the criminal expressway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From what I understand the &quot;Carnivore&quot; is a &quot;box&quot; (PC) in a &quot;cage&quot; (locked case)
</EM><BR>
with a &quot;NIC&quot; (network interface card) that plugs into the ISP's internal LAN
<BR>
which would have to be possibly be modified to make its network promiscuous.
<BR>
Thus that Carnivore would scan every single packet passing over that network,
<BR>
and all network activity of every user including every HTTP and e-mail
<BR>
transaction.
<BR>
<P>One consideration is that you can build one yourself for the price of a &quot;box&quot;
<BR>
and a &quot;NIC&quot;.  There are plentiful free scanner and text search programs.  I
<BR>
wonder how much the government pays for one of these things.
<BR>
<P>I still am wondering where is the precedent that all government employees are
<BR>
employess of the people, so that any person has the right to view government
<BR>
employees' e-mail as their employer.

<P><EM>&gt; I saw on the boob tube tonight an MSNBC program that aired an FBI man and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reporter discussing a new software program called 'Carnivore' (meaning it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can get to the meat) that the FBI plans to activate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If this is to take effect, the software is distributed to the server on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which our email is located, then it with a general eye scans all the email
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of every client (from who, to who, subject line) , it can also be told to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; search for specific words within the body of emails, and hunt them out. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim is, that it is to locate emails about hacking and other criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activity. I think there would be some trickle down effect for corporate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest as well. Survey results exposed on the show, explains that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporations do a high level of saving 'at work emails' and 'employee's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer data' as it is. My problem with this digital wiretap, is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be 'spying' on innocent people as well and infringing on their privacy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the context at which diction is used, may be misconstrued.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After the program aired, I searched the MSNBC site on the net and found a
