<P><EM>&gt; You could always go on the assumption that there is life out there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already.
</EM><BR>
<P>I focused on the following line in Damien's post:
<BR>
&nbsp;(here a miracle of insight into nature's working ocurs)
<BR>
<P>As an admirer of living systems, I've been thinking more along the lines
<BR>
of re-creating life  than looking for life out there already.  Whether
<BR>
recreating life would qualify as a method of transport is questionable,
<BR>
and I think the answer depends in part on the purpose behind your travel
<BR>
plans.   
<BR>
<P>If sight-seeing is your goal, then there seems to be no need to
<BR>
physcially transport yourself.  Even if you wish to establish a permanent
<BR>
presence in a distant place, there would  to be no need to transport
<BR>
yourself as human, or whatever form you happen to have at the beginning
<BR>
of your journey. (This brings up some interesting psychological
<BR>
questions--see end part of this post)
<BR>
<P>In fact, I think you'd want to include in your re-assembly instructions
<BR>
the command to assemble the new entity in such a way as to take best
<BR>
advantage of the new environment.  (this would require some sort of
<BR>
biological-type code capable of changing itslef in response to feedback
<BR>
as the assembly is taking place--super-rapid evolution)
<BR>
<P>If your goal is to exist in a distant place as some form of living
<BR>
consciousness not necessarily the same as your original form, there may
<BR>
be some inspiration at the UT Austin website for the Center for Nonlinear
<BR>
Dynamics at  <A HREF="http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu/">http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu/</A>  , in particular their pages on
<BR>
Biologically Inspired Physics, neural networks, and  pattern formation (I
<BR>
find the pattern formation stuff espeically interesting)--includes pics
<BR>
from *Nature* article on self-replicating chemical spots. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;My interest in these topics (in addition to simple curiosity) is driven
<BR>
by the desire to understand ecological systems.  Practical applications
<BR>
would include terra-forming planets other than Earth; but of more
<BR>
immediate concern to me is the idea of  re-terraforming ravaged portions
<BR>
of Earth's lands and waters, and creating productive ecological systems
<BR>
on desert-quality land.  This is a far cry from designing a transport
<BR>
system, but it seems as though some of the same concepts might be useful
<BR>
for both purposes.
<BR>
<P>Psychological questions: Assuming that the the re-assembly instructions
<BR>
include preserving the memories of the original entity, what would it be
<BR>
like to regain consciousness within a body completely different from the
<BR>
original one?  What might a person's reaction be to &quot;waking up&quot; and
<BR>
finding that his mind is now housed in a body that has the form of a
<BR>
rigid crystalline structure? I suppose you'd want to build in some
<BR>
mechanism that the traveler could use to kill himself if he decided his
<BR>
new way of life was unbearable.  Or perhaps the assembly instructions
<BR>
would include the ability to alter the mind to the extent that it would
<BR>
be pleased to find itself in its new circumstances.  You'd probably want
<BR>
to broadcast a number of code strings since you'd expect at least some of
<BR>
them to run into trouble of one sort or another.   But in that case, you
<BR>
might end up with several new versions of &quot;you&quot; in different places. 
<BR>
They'd immediately begin to diverge upon regaining consciousness.  Pehaps
<BR>
at some point they'd meet again--maybe two or more would find themselves
<BR>
on different sides of a battle.  Interesting metaphor for the disordered
<BR>
mind.
