Hal &lt;<A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009061741.LAA02570@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</A>&gt; asked:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 	To me, free will is the ability to do research to discover
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that which is the best, and then set such as a goal and seek after it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whatever it turns out to be.  To the degree that you can reliably and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deterministically know and get what is truly the best the more you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; free.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But can't you argue that this is not free will, but rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enslavement to this arbitrary goal of seeking the &quot;best&quot;?  (&quot;Best&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at what, anyway?)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why should seeking this particular goal be entitled to be called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;free will&quot;, while being enslaved to some other goal, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maximizing your owner's return on investment, would not?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it could be the belief that there is some omega
<BR>
point like absolute best for all.  By definition, what is best, is
<BR>
what we all want.  Anything that chooses less, for whatever reason, is
<BR>
&quot;enslaved&quot;, unfree, or unable to get what it really wants - By
<BR>
definition.  It makes no sense to say one wants to chose what it does
<BR>
not want. Or that it is &quot;enslaved&quot; if it is getting what it really
<BR>
wants does it?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, until we know the absolute, or if the absolute is
<BR>
more open ended, then we will likely never know absolutely for sure
<BR>
what we really want or what is of absolutely the most value.  We will
<BR>
always run the risk of finding something that is better than what we
<BR>
thought we wanted, and when we do thise, we will become more free
<BR>
since we will then be better at both knowing what we want and getting
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, anything that causes us to deviate from that which is
<BR>
the best, whether it be ignorance, inability, some perverted ability
<BR>
to &quot;do otherwise&quot; enslaves us, and prevents us from getting what we
<BR>
really want, it doesn't make us free does it?
<BR>
