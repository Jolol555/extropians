<P>&lt;&lt; It is a pretty twisty notion as are most time-travel type paradoxes.  It
<BR>
&nbsp;would lead to the notion (among others) that any universe whose initial
<BR>
&nbsp;conditions allow for the development of such Sentience and where
<BR>
&nbsp;time-travel is possible and closed within the universe is largely the
<BR>
&nbsp;creation of said Sentience.  But that would conflate abilities to
<BR>
&nbsp;transcend time and participate largely throughout its [the universe]
<BR>
&nbsp;development with actual participation.  And I don't see that such
<BR>
&nbsp;participation necessarily could extend all the way to the actual birth
<BR>
&nbsp;of that universe or to periods and more local conditions where no known
<BR>
&nbsp;laws of physics would support intelligence or information or action. 
<BR>
&nbsp;The Sentience would have to be able to step outside the Universe to
<BR>
&nbsp;exercise that level of control if it is possible at all.  Admittedly
<BR>
&nbsp;armchair blather but fun nonetheless. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
-------------------------------
<BR>
More armchair blather here, because there has been work by some scientists 
<BR>
regarding this subject. Certainly there has been the recent theortical work 
<BR>
by physicist, Neil Shulman, at Clarkson College in New York concerning time 
<BR>
reversing. Kurt Godel also pondered time-reversal, sideways lopps, and how to 
<BR>
best utilize causality, without violating it. Realistically how important is 
<BR>
this to our lives, does it have meaning for us? Possibly it does, but  for 
<BR>
most logical positivists the answer is nyet. Deep in the future of spacetime, 
<BR>
it just might, long after we are gone, gone, gone, and then back again. Here 
<BR>
is another theorist's work.
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
Here comes hypertime 
<BR>
<P><P>Want to sidestep your future or rearrange your past? An extra time dimension 
<BR>
could be all you need, and it might even be the key to the theory of 
<BR>
everything
<BR>
<P><P>Space, it seems, is fair game. For years, physicists discontented with the 
<BR>
paltry three dimensions of space that our senses offer us have been merrily 
<BR>
adding extra ones to their equations. First there were four, then there were 
<BR>
nine. The best bet today appears to be ten dimensions of space, with seven of 
<BR>
them curled up so tightly that we can't see them.
<BR>
<P>Time, on the other hand, has been largely left alone by the theorists. One 
<BR>
time dimension is all you need, they say. Add any more and all hell will 
<BR>
break loose. But in the past couple of years all that has changed. One daring 
<BR>
physicist-Cumrun Vafa from Harvard-has discovered that an extra time 
<BR>
dimension could solve more problems than it creates.
<BR>
<P>But problems there certainly are. Where is this extra time? Is it just a 
<BR>
mathematical convenience or is it really out there? What will it do to our 
<BR>
notions of past and future, cause and effect? &quot;We find ourselves floundering 
<BR>
around when there's more than one time,&quot; says theorist Michael Duff of Texas 
<BR>
A&amp;M University. &quot;It becomes very confusing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The whole idea that extra dimensions can be useful stems from attempts to 
<BR>
unify the different forces of nature. Back in 1920, mathematicians found that 
<BR>
moving up to five dimensions, instead of the four dimensions of space-time, 
<BR>
helped them to reconcile electromagnetism with gravity. It was like climbing 
<BR>
a hill to look down on a two-dimensional battlefield. Suddenly, they could 
<BR>
see how all the parts of the battle plan fitted together.
<BR>
<P>In recent years, more dimensions have entered the fray. In 1984 came the 
<BR>
superstring revolution-the idea that the Universe is made up of 
<BR>
one-dimensional strings vibrating in a background of nine dimensions of space 
<BR>
and one of time. Then in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced 
<BR>
Study at Princeton, New Jersey, and Paul Townsend of the University of 
<BR>
Cambridge added a further space dimension to create M-theory. At a stroke, 
<BR>
this last addition seemed to unify the embarrassing plethora of string 
<BR>
theories that physicists had dreamt up (&quot;Into the eleventh dimension&quot;, New 
<BR>
Scientist , 18 January, p 32)
<BR>
<P>Yet despite its great promise, M-theory has not ironed out all the 
<BR>
differences between the various string theories, which is where Vafa and his 
<BR>
&quot;F-theory&quot; comes in, upping the ante to 12 dimensions. The remaining problems 
<BR>
began to fall away with an extra dimension, and theorists eagerly welcomed 
<BR>
Vafa's equations. But the new dimension was one of time, and the 
<BR>
philosophical implications are rather more troubling.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Most theorists would shun the idea of more than one time,&quot; says Duff, who 
<BR>
has himself dabbled with the idea of a 12th time-like dimension. &quot;It brings 
<BR>
all sorts of headaches that we would rather do without.&quot; It's easy to see 
<BR>
why. If time is one-dimensional, like a straight line, every point on the 
<BR>
line is either before or after every other point. Future and past are well 
<BR>
defined. Every set of events has a unique sequence. But add another dimension 
<BR>
and the line becomes a plane. How do you define future and past now? How do 
<BR>
you link events-the whole game of physics-when the idea of effect following 
<BR>
cause has evaporated?
<BR>
<P>According to Duff that's not the end of it. Time dimensions differ 
<BR>
fundamentally from space dimensions in one important respect: when you insert 
<BR>
time into your equations it tends to come in with a negative rather than a 
<BR>
positive sign. If you start to mess around with extra time dimensions, all 
<BR>
sorts of nasties start to emerge-objects that travel faster than light, 
<BR>
photons with negative energy, events where the probabilities of all possible 
<BR>
outcomes don't add up to one.
<BR>
<P>Primitive tools
<BR>
<P>Admittedly, says Duff, the tools we use to understand the world may be at 
<BR>
fault. Perhaps the existing approaches are too primitive to describe multiple 
<BR>
times. But since these are the only tools around, the best approach seems to 
<BR>
be to treat Vafa's extra time dimension as a convenient device rather than a 
<BR>
real physical entity. Exploit the benefits it offers and finesse your way 
<BR>
around the disadvantages.
<BR>
<P>Indeed, Vafa's new time has some suspicious characteristics that could 
<BR>
justify this approach. For instance, while the 11 dimensions of M-theory obey 
<BR>
Einstein's relativity principle, which says that the laws of physics should 
<BR>
look the same to all observers, Vafa's 12 dimensions do not. This is one more 
<BR>
reason for physicists to discount the new dimension's physical reality. &quot;It's 
<BR>
by no means on the same footing as ordinary time,&quot; says Frank Wilczek of the 
<BR>
Institute for Advanced Study. Duff agrees. Though it looks like time in some 
<BR>
limited ways, he says, &quot;it's not a real, honest-to-goodness extra time 
<BR>
dimension.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Vafa admits that his extra dimension has many of the hallmarks of an abstract 
<BR>
mathematical device rather than a real physical entity. But this may not be 
<BR>
the case for much longer. &quot;At this point, it's making the formalism look 
<BR>
nicer,&quot; he says. &quot;Whenever that happens in the history of physics, there's 
<BR>
usually something behind it.&quot; Take quarks. A few decades ago, quarks were a 
<BR>
mathematical construction-a way of thinking about the make-up of particles 
<BR>
such as protons. According to the equations, quarks could never exist as 
<BR>
single individuals. They seemed to be theoretical conveniences. Now, says 
<BR>
Vafa, most physicists agree that quarks do exist in the physical world. The 
<BR>
same happy fate could await his mysterious extra time dimension.
<BR>
<P>But if it's really out there, why haven't we seen it? One possibility is 
<BR>
that, along with the seven &quot;missing&quot; space dimensions, the extra time 
<BR>
dimension is curled up so tightly that it's invisible to us. If so, the only 
<BR>
way to unwrap it would be to focus huge amounts of energy into a tiny volume. 
<BR>
This would have remarkable consequences.
<BR>
<P>&quot;If the [extra] time dimension could be unleashed, objects would not have the 
<BR>
sensation of moving in time the way that we do,&quot; says Vafa. Think about it. 
<BR>
In space we have choices about how to move, forwards and backwards, up and 
<BR>
down, left and right. For time, our only choice appears to be forward into 
<BR>
the future-Hobson's choice. But with more than one time dimension, says 
<BR>
Wilczek, it might become possible to manoeuvre sideways in time, or 
<BR>
diagonally. If we saw an undesirable event looming in the &quot;future&quot; we might 
<BR>
even be able to sidestep it.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps it's just as well, then, that the prospects of releasing Vafa's 
<BR>
hidden dimension are actually rather remote. It is extremely unlikely that an 
<BR>
energy intense enough to activate the missing time exists anywhere in our 
<BR>
Universe-though some physicists speculate that it might happen in the centre 
<BR>
of a black hole. But that's not the end of the line for real-life multiple 
<BR>
times. After all, according to the latest cosmological theories there could 
<BR>
be plenty of other universes, each of which might have its own unique 
<BR>
combination of space and time dimensions.
<BR>
<P>What would it be like in a truly multi-time universe? &quot;It would really be a 
<BR>
mind-stretcher,&quot; says Wilczek. &quot;Is it impossible? No I don't think so. You 
<BR>
can write down the equations, but I have very little feeling for what the 
<BR>
solutions would be like to live in.&quot;
