<EM>&gt; &gt;our conscious minds are more like the PR department of our minds ...

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, I think that's very true. ... If we see a tawny jungle cat as a pile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of brown leaves, we won't last very long.  So perceptual illusions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relatively rare.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However no such pressure operates in the mind.  There is little need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maintain an accurate picture of its internal workings.  Rather, what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;needed is a convenient picture, one which facilitates survival even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it has little bearing to the truth.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Imagine ... we have a collection of agents... to construct a fictional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consciousness, a memory trace which is created after the fact and which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;presents a fictional but unified picture of the mind's activities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even if there is no direct pressure for truth, there may be indirect
<BR>
pressures.  It all depends on what exactly the evolutionary function of
<BR>
consciousness is.  It is obviously something social, and I alluded to
<BR>
a &quot;PR&quot; model, but that's still pretty vague.  Even PR departments tell
<BR>
the truth sometimes.
