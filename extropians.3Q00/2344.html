He said that he'd write part 3 (he had already committed to part 2 before
<BR>
this all began) if at least 75% paid for part 1.  76% paid up front and he
<BR>
said that more people were sending money in after the fact.

<EM>&gt; More than 76% of the people who downloaded Stephen King's &quot;The Plant Part
</EM><BR>
I&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; actually paid for it.  He made no effort to enforce the payment of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; book - he just promised he'd keep writing installments as long as enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people paid for it.  Well, apparently they have.
</EM><BR>
<P>I predict that the percentage who pay will drop as the novelty wears off.
<BR>
Has King said what the threshold is below which he won't continue?
<BR>
My guess is that the percentage who pay will approach that level.
