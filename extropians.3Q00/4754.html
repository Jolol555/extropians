<EM>&gt; I know there have been studies supporting the 2nd

<EM>&gt; young girls for extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; training in scientific areas?
</EM><BR>
<P>Following is the summary from:
<BR>
<P>Findings from The Condition of Education 1997: Women
<BR>
in Mathematics and Science
<BR>
<P>&lt; <A HREF="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97982.html">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97982.html</A> &gt;
<BR>
<P>Women have made important advances in education over
<BR>
the last few decades, closing the gender gap in the
<BR>
level of educational attainment among younger women
<BR>
that existed 20 years ago. In fact, for several years,
<BR>
women have been awarded the majority of associate’s,
<BR>
bachelor’s, and master’s degrees. However, a gender
<BR>
gap still exists with respect to mathematics and
<BR>
science, and it widens as students climb the education
<BR>
ladder. Although boys and girls have similar
<BR>
mathematics and science proficiencies at age 9, a gap
<BR>
begins to appear at age 13. At age 17, there is some
<BR>
evidence that the gender gap in mathematics and
<BR>
science has narrowed over time, although a substantial
<BR>
gap remains. Internationally, a gender gap in science
<BR>
is common across countries at grade 8, while it is
<BR>
less evident in mathematics. 
<BR>
<P>Even though girls are less likely than boys to aspire
<BR>
to careers in science or engineering as early as grade
<BR>
eight, boys’ and girls’ attitudes toward mathematics
<BR>
and science appear to be similar up to grade 10 (a
<BR>
time when the attitudes of boys and girls have already
<BR>
diverged in other large industrialized countries).
<BR>
Among U.S. 12th-graders, however, a gender gap in
<BR>
attitudes is apparent in science.
<BR>
<P>The mathematics and science courses that women and men
<BR>
take in high school are similar, with the exceptions
<BR>
that women remain less likely than men to study
<BR>
physics but are more likely to take chemistry. Among
<BR>
students who do not take mathematics or science in
<BR>
their senior year, women are more likely than men to
<BR>
say that they did so either because others advised
<BR>
them that they did not need those courses or because
<BR>
they disliked the subject matter.
<BR>
<P>While women are just as likely as men to go to college
<BR>
immediately after high school, from the start they are
<BR>
less interested in majoring in mathematics and
<BR>
science. Although women tend to major in different
<BR>
subjects than men in college, some of these
<BR>
differences have narrowed over time. The mathematics
<BR>
and science fields continue to be areas where the
<BR>
gender gap remains large. Women are far less likely
<BR>
than men to earn bachelor’s degrees in computer
<BR>
science, engineering, physical sciences, or
<BR>
mathematics. 
<BR>
<P>Even though women make up about half of the labor
<BR>
market, they are both underrepresented in jobs in
<BR>
scientific fields and are paid less than men. Some of
<BR>
these differences can be explained by differences in
<BR>
the field chosen, level of experience, and level of
<BR>
education. Overall, there are still substantial
<BR>
differences between women and men in mathematics and
<BR>
science fields, and these differences appear as early
<BR>
as middle school. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; An observation I made was that from birth boy and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; girl babies are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generally treated differently, one difference being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that girl babies are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more closely protected.  I wondered if this early
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protection might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent girls from developing an understanding of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the way things work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (eg. if a little girl isn't allowed to play on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see-saw she'd lack an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early grasp of the concept that Work= Force x
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Distance) . 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I recall a study involving nurses who were told to
<BR>
hold babies in their laps. The nurses were made aware
<BR>
of each baby's gender before they placed them on their
<BR>
laps. Each nurse was individually observed to hold
<BR>
what they believed to be female babies close in to
<BR>
their bodies while the male babies were more likely to
<BR>
be held out closer to the knees. The actual sex of the
<BR>
baby was randomly chosen.
