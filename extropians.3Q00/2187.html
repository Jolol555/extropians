<P>Cloning Human Beings, June 1997 
<BR>
Executive Summary
<BR>
Volume I. Report and Recommendations 
<BR>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
<BR>
<P>The idea that humans might someday be cloned-created from a single somatic
<BR>
cell without sexual reproduction-moved further away from science fiction and
<BR>
closer to a genuine scientific possibility on February 23, 1997. On that
<BR>
date, The Observer broke the news that Ian Wilmut, a Scottish scientist, and
<BR>
his colleagues at the Roslin Institute were about to announce the successful
<BR>
cloning of a sheep by a new technique which had never before been fully
<BR>
successful in mammals. The technique involved transplanting the genetic
<BR>
material of an adult sheep, apparently obtained from a differentiated
<BR>
somatic cell, into an egg from which the nucleus had been removed. The
<BR>
resulting birth of the sheep, named Dolly, on July 5, 1996, was different
<BR>
from prior attempts to create identical offspring since Dolly contained the
<BR>
genetic material of only one parent, and was, therefore, a &quot;delayed&quot; genetic
<BR>
twin of a single adult sheep. 
<BR>
This cloning technique is an extension of research that had been ongoing for
<BR>
over 40 years using nuclei derived from non-human embryonic and fetal cells.
<BR>
The demonstration that nuclei from cells derived from an adult animal could
<BR>
be &quot;reprogrammed,&quot; or that the full genetic complement of such a cell could
<BR>
be reactivated well into the chronological life of the cell, is what sets
<BR>
the results of this experiment apart from prior work. In this report the
<BR>
technique, first described by Wilmut, of nuclear transplantation using
<BR>
nuclei derived from somatic cells other than those of an embryo or fetus is
<BR>
referred to as &quot;somatic cell nuclear transfer.&quot; 
<BR>
Within days of the published report of Dolly, President Clinton instituted a
<BR>
ban on federal funding related to attempts to clone human beings in this
<BR>
manner. In addition, the President asked the recently appointed National
<BR>
Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to address within ninety days the
<BR>
ethical and legal issues that surround the subject of cloning human beings.
<BR>
This provided a welcome opportunity for initiating a thoughtful analysis of
<BR>
the many dimensions of the issue, including a careful consideration of the
<BR>
potential risks and benefits. It also presented an occasion to review the
<BR>
current legal status of cloning and the potential constitutional challenges
<BR>
that might be raised if new legislation were enacted to restrict the
<BR>
creation of a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning. 
<BR>
The Commission began its discussions fully recognizing that any effort in
<BR>
humans to transfer a somatic cell nucleus into an enucleated egg involves
<BR>
the creation of an embryo, with the apparent potential to be implanted in
<BR>
utero and developed to term. Ethical concerns surrounding issues of embryo
<BR>
research have recently received extensive analysis and deliberation in the
<BR>
United States. Indeed, federal funding for human embryo research is severely
<BR>
restricted, although there are few restrictions on human embryo research
<BR>
carried out in the private sector. Thus, under current law, the use of
<BR>
somatic cell nuclear transfer to create an embryo solely for research
<BR>
purposes is already restricted in cases involving federal funds. There are,
<BR>
however, no current federal regulations on the use of private funds for this
<BR>
purpose. 
<BR>
The unique prospect, vividly raised by Dolly, is the creation of a new
<BR>
individual genetically identical to an existing (or previously existing)
<BR>
person-a &quot;delayed&quot; genetic twin. This prospect has been the source of the
<BR>
overwhelming public concern about such cloning. While the creation of
<BR>
embryos for research purposes alone always raises serious ethical questions,
<BR>
the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create embryos raises no new
<BR>
issues in this respect. The unique and distinctive ethical issues raised by
<BR>
the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create children relate to, for
<BR>
example, serious safety concerns, individuality, family integrity, and
<BR>
treating children as objects. Consequently, the Commission focused its
<BR>
attention on the use of such techniques for the purpose of creating an
<BR>
embryo which would then be implanted in a woman's uterus and brought to
<BR>
term. It also expanded its analysis of this particular issue to encompass
<BR>
activities in both the public and private sector. 
<BR>
In its deliberations, NBAC reviewed the scientific developments which
<BR>
preceded the Roslin announcement, as well as those likely to follow in its
<BR>
path. It also considered the many moral concerns raised by the possibility
<BR>
that this technique could be used to clone human beings. Much of the initial
<BR>
reaction to this possibility was negative. Careful assessment of that
<BR>
response revealed fears about harms to the children who may be created in
<BR>
this manner, particularly psychological harms associated with a possibly
<BR>
diminished sense of individuality and personal autonomy. Others expressed
<BR>
concern about a degradation in the quality of parenting and family life. 
<BR>
In addition to concerns about specific harms to children, people have
<BR>
frequently expressed fears that the widespread practice of somatic cell
<BR>
nuclear transfer cloning would undermine important social values by opening
<BR>
the door to a form of eugenics or by tempting some to manipulate others as
<BR>
if they were objects instead of persons. Arrayed against these concerns are
<BR>
other important social values, such as protecting the widest possible sphere
<BR>
of personal choice, particularly in matters pertaining to procreation and
<BR>
child rearing, maintaining privacy and the freedom of scientific inquiry,
<BR>
and encouraging the possible development of new biomedical breakthroughs. 
<BR>
To arrive at its recommendations concerning the use of somatic cell nuclear
<BR>
transfer techniques to create children, NBAC also examined long-standing
<BR>
religious traditions that guide many citizens' responses to new technologies
<BR>
and found that religious positions on human cloning are pluralistic in their
<BR>
premises, modes of argument, and conclusions. Some religious thinkers argue
<BR>
that the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning to create a child
<BR>
would be intrinsically immoral and thus could never be morally justified.
<BR>
Other religious thinkers contend that human cloning to create a child could
<BR>
be morally justified under some circumstances, but hold that it should be
<BR>
strictly regulated in order to prevent abuses. 
<BR>
The public policies recommended with respect to the creation of a child
<BR>
using somatic cell nuclear transfer reflect the Commission's best judgments
<BR>
about both the ethics of attempting such an experiment and its view of
<BR>
traditions regarding limitations on individual actions in the name of the
<BR>
common good. At present, the use of this technique to create a child would
<BR>
be a premature experiment that would expose the fetus and the developing
<BR>
child to unacceptable risks. This in itself might be sufficient to justify a
<BR>
prohibition on cloning human beings at this time, even if such efforts were
<BR>
to be characterized as the exercise of a fundamental right to attempt to
<BR>
procreate. 
<BR>
Beyond the issue of the safety of the procedure, however, NBAC found that
<BR>
concerns relating to the potential psychological harms to children and
<BR>
effects on the moral, religious, and cultural values of society merited
<BR>
further reflection and deliberation. Whether upon such further deliberation
<BR>
our nation will conclude that the use of cloning techniques to create
<BR>
children should be allowed or permanently banned is, for the moment, an open
<BR>
question. Time is an ally in this regard, allowing for the accrual of
<BR>
further data from animal experimentation, enabling an assessment of the
<BR>
prospective safety and efficacy of the procedure in humans, as well as
<BR>
granting a period of fuller national debate on ethical and social concerns.
<BR>
The Commission therefore concluded that there should be imposed a period of
<BR>
time in which no attempt is made to create a child using somatic cell
<BR>
nuclear transfer. 1 
<BR>
Within this overall framework the Commission came to the following
<BR>
conclusions and recommendations: 
<BR>
I.	The Commission concludes that at this time it is morally
<BR>
unacceptable for anyone in the public or private sector, whether in a
<BR>
research or clinical setting, to attempt to create a child using somatic
<BR>
cell nuclear transfer cloning. The Commission reached a consensus on this
<BR>
point because current scientific information indicates that this technique
<BR>
is not safe to use in humans at this point. Indeed, the Commission believes
<BR>
it would violate important ethical obligations were clinicians or
<BR>
researchers to attempt to create a child using these particular
<BR>
technologies, which are likely to involve unacceptable risks to the fetus
<BR>
and/or potential child. Moreover, in addition to safety concerns, many other
<BR>
serious ethical concerns have been identified, which require much more
<BR>
widespread and careful public deliberation before this technology may be
<BR>
used. 
<BR>
The Commission, therefore, recommends the following for immediate action: 
<BR>
* A continuation of the current moratorium on the use of federal funding in
<BR>
support of any attempt to create a child by somatic cell nuclear transfer. 
<BR>
* An immediate request to all firms, clinicians, investigators, and
<BR>
professional societies in the private and non-federally funded sectors to
<BR>
comply voluntarily with the intent of the federal moratorium. Professional
<BR>
and scientific societies should make clear that any attempt to create a
<BR>
child by somatic cell nuclear transfer and implantation into a woman's body
<BR>
would at this time be an irresponsible, unethical, and unprofessional act. 
<BR>
II.	The Commission further recommends that: 
<BR>
* Federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit anyone from attempting,
<BR>
whether in a research or clinical setting, to create a child through somatic
<BR>
cell nuclear transfer cloning. It is critical, however, that such
<BR>
legislation include a sunset clause to ensure that Congress will review the
<BR>
issue after a specified time period (three to five years) in order to decide
<BR>
whether the prohibition continues to be needed. If state legislation is
<BR>
enacted, it should also contain such a sunset provision. Any such
<BR>
legislation or associated regulation also ought to require that at some
<BR>
point prior to the expiration of the sunset period, an appropriate oversight
<BR>
body will evaluate and report on the current status of somatic cell nuclear
<BR>
transfer technology and on the ethical and social issues that its potential
<BR>
use to create human beings would raise in light of public understandings at
<BR>
that time. 
<BR>
III.	The Commission also concludes that: 
<BR>
* Any regulatory or legislative actions undertaken to effect the foregoing
<BR>
prohibition on creating a child by somatic cell nuclear transfer should be
<BR>
carefully written so as not to interfere with other important areas of
<BR>
scientific research. In particular, no new regulations are required
<BR>
regarding the cloning of human DNA sequences and cell lines, since neither
<BR>
activity raises the scientific and ethical issues that arise from the
<BR>
attempt to create children through somatic cell nuclear transfer, and these
<BR>
fields of research have already provided important scientific and biomedical
<BR>
advances. Likewise, research on cloning animals by somatic cell nuclear
<BR>
transfer does not raise the issues implicated in attempting to use this
<BR>
technique for human cloning, and its continuation should only be subject to
<BR>
existing regulations regarding the humane use of animals and review by
<BR>
institution-based animal protection committees. 
<BR>
* If a legislative ban is not enacted, or if a legislative ban is ever
<BR>
lifted, clinical use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create a
<BR>
child should be preceded by research trials that are governed by the twin
<BR>
protections of independent review and informed consent, consistent with
<BR>
existing norms of human subjects protection. 
<BR>
* The United States Government should cooperate with other nations and
<BR>
international organizations to enforce any common aspects of their
<BR>
respective policies on the cloning of human beings. 
<BR>
IV.	The Commission also concludes that different ethical and religious
<BR>
perspectives and traditions are divided on many of the important moral
<BR>
issues that surround any attempt to create a child using somatic cell
<BR>
nuclear transfer techniques. Therefore, the Commission recommends that: 
<BR>
* The federal government, and all interested and concerned parties,
<BR>
encourage widespread and continuing deliberation on these issues in order to
<BR>
further our understanding of the ethical and social implications of this
<BR>
technology and to enable society to produce appropriate long-term policies
<BR>
regarding this technology should the time come when present concerns about
<BR>
safety have been addressed. 
<BR>
V.	Finally, because scientific knowledge is essential for all citizens
<BR>
to participate in a full and informed fashion in the governance of our
<BR>
complex society, the Commission recommends that: 
<BR>
* Federal departments and agencies concerned with science should cooperate
<BR>
in seeking out and supporting opportunities to provide information and
<BR>
education to the public in the area of genetics, and on other developments
<BR>
in the biomedical sciences, especially where these affect important cultural
<BR>
practices, values, and beliefs. 
<BR>
<P>Note: 
<BR>
1 The Commission also observes that the use of any other technique to create
<BR>
a child genetically identical to an existing (or previously existing)
<BR>
individual would raise many, if not all, of the same non-safety-related
<BR>
ethical concerns raised by the creation of a child by somatic cell nuclear
<BR>
transfer.
