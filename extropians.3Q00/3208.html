<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think on first view it is a good idea, but I  we may be viewed as
<BR>
<EM>&gt;another wacko group preaching the sermon. I hope not. There has been a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;greater swing towards Transhumanist themes on channels such as Discovery
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;especially Discover SCI TREK. Max was on a program the other week and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extropian &quot;society&quot; was mentioned and put across in good light. (a repeat I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;   It would be good to see a program dedicated to us and some of the
</EM><BR>
things
<BR>
<EM>&gt;we are doing to progress the human state for the betterment of mankind.
</EM><BR>
Maybe
<BR>
<EM>&gt;we could put a program together ourselves, Im sure between us we have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resources and certainly the talent and enough subject matter to keep the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;average Joe interested for an hour.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex
<BR>
<P>Why the lack of ambition? The scientologists &amp; rabid Christian cultists seem
<BR>
to be able to put together
<BR>
TV channels and big recruitment drives .... if you think that &quot;radical
<BR>
futurism&quot; can be covered in an hour-long doc and repeated ... then there
<BR>
can't be very much to your mental universe.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; There are, I understand, several Christian and other fringe/religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  channels in the USA ... and some planned for the UK. I have been
</EM><BR>
approached
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  by some of the &quot;pagan movement&quot; about setting up a pagan/ new age channel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (cable, not internet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;oh no, tree hugger mother earth TV. I can imagine it now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Extropianism can be dismissed in similar throw-away terms (robotic sci-fi
<BR>
fantasists &amp;c) ... but the facts are that there is a *synergy* between the
<BR>
interests of techno-pagans, nu-agers and extropians ... all of which groups
<BR>
want progress away from failing aspects of the inert shopping-channel
<BR>
mainstream.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Posthumans&quot; were mentioned by Blavatsky in the Secret Doctrine in the
<BR>
1800's, and surely no  Extropian or trans-human can disagree with the
<BR>
Victorian adept McGegor Mather's advice that we try to be &quot;more than human.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Tree-hugging&quot; environmentalists tend to be scientists ... surely none of us
<BR>
argues for the destruction of Earth?
<BR>
Global warming seems to have something to do with the recent forest fires in
<BR>
the States, Alex, or are you pleased to see the destruction of all these
<BR>
trees?
<BR>
<P>Response to the Extropian &amp; Nu-Age TV/ Radio have been quite good (I see
<BR>
them as two separate things from a programming perspective, but maybe
<BR>
sharing infrastructure &amp; advertising &amp;c).
<BR>
<P>Love &amp; Peace
