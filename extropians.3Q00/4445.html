<EM>&gt;You're kidding right?  Sure the Internet is definitely leveling

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aquatinted with the DeCSS trial at <A HREF="http://www.2600.com/">http://www.2600.com/</A>  Not only has Judge

<EM>&gt;Kaplan said that code is not protected speech, but that even linking to

<EM>&gt;getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;squashed.  My hope is that the internet and the advent of peer-to-peer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;networking will level hierarchies beyond anything we've seen yet.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Paul, before I address these sentences, I would like you to tell me who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;little guy&quot; is.  What demographic do you have in mind?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Isn't it glaringly obvious?  You and me of course.  The individual, your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;average non-millionare citizen, the non-incorporated being, the average 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;joe,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;joe six-pack, mom, dad, your little sister, your friendly neighbor, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;barber,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your co-worker, the employee, the clerk, the gas station attendant, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else without the financial or political power to manipulate or bully the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or political process anywhere close to what a multi-billion dollar 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is capable of doing.  This is especially true where the corporation is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plaintiff.

A case in point is the situation with dental care.  There is probably as 
<BR>
much or more fraud in dental care in the U.S. as there is in auto repair, 
<BR>
where it is estimated to run about 60%.  Faye Willard, the lady who started 
<BR>
the American Dental Victims Association, tried sueing a Long Beach dentist 
<BR>
who first cut off the tops of her teeth, leaving the roots exposed, then 
<BR>
suddenly told her that their deal was off, and she had to sign an agreement 
<BR>
to pay a lot more money than had been previously agreed to before they would 
<BR>
install the crowns.
<BR>
<P>She hired a lawyer and sued, but was forced by the court to first go into 
<BR>
arbitration, where she was awared $15,000, I believe.  She had already spent 
<BR>
that on her lawyer plus other expenses, so she turned down the award and 
<BR>
went into the state court.  The judge was on a first-name basis with the 
<BR>
dentists and their lawyers.  Faye couldn't afford to hire a court reporter 
<BR>
and the judge absolutely refused to allow her to tape record the 
<BR>
proceedings.
<BR>
<P>Of the 15 or so counts on which she was basing her suit, the judge refused 
<BR>
to allow all but one or two, so the jury only saw a fraction of the case on 
<BR>
which the arbitration award had been based.  Thus, they also awarded her 
<BR>
$15,000, which meant that she now got to pay the court costs, as it was the 
<BR>
same or less than the arbitration award.  When Faye tried to file an appeal, 
<BR>
of course she discovered that the court records were falsified and had her 
<BR>
saying things totally contrary to fact.  (This happens a lot, especially in 
<BR>
lower court proceedings and in pseudo-courts like Workman's Comp hearings. 
<BR>
It's pretty much a tip-off when the &quot;judge&quot; won't allow tape recording.)
<BR>
<P>There are entire books by licensed dentists that describe exactly the 
<BR>
procedures that are commonly used by dentists to ensure that you will be 
<BR>
making many unhappy returns.  As Paul correctly points out, the average 
<BR>
person stands little chance going up against a professional scam operation.  
<BR>
They have had lots of experience working out the bugs in their legal warfare 
<BR>
kit.
