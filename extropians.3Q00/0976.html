<EM>&gt; I see two very contradictory points in your threads, Lee.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One is that artists need to stand up for themselves and know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their worth and quit being doormats.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The other is they shouldn't have  copyright laws and legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protection, subsidies, unionpay scales, etc. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...just &quot;make it happen&quot; somehow.
</EM><BR>
<P>They seem contradictory, and I probably am being less clear
<BR>
than I could be.  My only issue is with copyright: the idea
<BR>
that ideas are &quot;ownable&quot;.  I oppose that for ethical reasons,
<BR>
and I think humanity as a whole suffers from the shackles
<BR>
put on our collective minds by this restriction on the free
<BR>
flow of information of all kinds.
<BR>
<P>Ethics aside, I also argue that pragmatically copyright does
<BR>
not serve artists as it is supposed to--it serves publishers,
<BR>
and to some extent mediocre artists; good artists could make
<BR>
good livings without it.  I think that good artists are making
<BR>
a mistake to think that they need copyright to earn a living.
<BR>
<P>Of course I oppose all subsidies of any kind.  I don't know
<BR>
where you get any idea about unions; they're a great capitalist
<BR>
invention I support fully.
<BR>
