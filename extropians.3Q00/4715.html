<EM>&gt; Well, since Greg asked the question and Mike and Eugene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offered a couple of responses (very informative responses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but IMO wrong), I'll throw my 2 cents worth into the pot.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Dark Horse will win the race...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike offered up a list of current technologies but missed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; several such a Cadmium Telluride, see:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/documents/thinfilm.html">http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/documents/thinfilm.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the bibliography at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/eshbib.html">http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/eshbib.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also missing is CuInSe2, being manufactured by Siemens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apparently.  See
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/solar/comparing_pv_arrays.htm">http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/solar/comparing_pv_arrays.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While the efficiency on the thin film arrays is poor, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturing cost advantages may win out.  The area
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of most American roofs is large and if you can roll out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electricity collectors as thin as plastic sheets on them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you have a big win.  Europe and Japan might have to go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an alternate route.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is much as I said in my post. However, the average American roof (only
<BR>
half of which is useful as a collector, the other half facing away from the sun
<BR>
(and only if the home is lucky enough to have one side facing south. Facing east
<BR>
and west is useless)) is around 12 x 5 meters, or 60 square meters. A 10%
<BR>
efficient system that covers the entire roof, with no skylights, will generate 6
<BR>
kilowatts ONLY at the peak period at noon. Power generation will begin at a very
<BR>
low level around 7 am and end at about 7 pm, and increase along a bell curve up
<BR>
and down through the day. Such a system will generate around 20-24 kilowatt
<BR>
hours per day, assuming no cloudy weather. This is less than 10% of the power
<BR>
needs of the average home.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, then Mike in a burst of &quot;go Space&quot; enthusiasm, chimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in with:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How things will fall out is that by 2030 solar power sats will start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; getting built, and an orbital network of MASER power transmission
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; systems will transport energy to key sites on each continent. Prime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; location for the power sats will be at the Sun-earth L2 point, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the sats will also act to reduce total flux reaching earth, thus helping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to offset any global warming effects whether they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be a result of pollution or Malenkovich Cycles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Fossil fuels will continue to be used for transportation beyond this point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but not for static uses, although work will be done on using reverse fuel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cells to produce natural gas from electricity. Hydrogen will NOT be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fuel of choice, due to its corrosive properties and low density.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rasberries...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First of all if we don't have diamondoid nanotech by 2030, I will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; publically eat a hat (cotton please) at Extro 19 (assuming it is after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2030).  If we have diamondoid nanotech, then space power satellites become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevant.  (We will have the entire power output of the sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at our or &quot;someones&quot; disposal.)
</EM><BR>
<P>You are assuming that people will *WANT* to do what you suggest. The arrival of
<BR>
the nano-santa will result in people becoming more environmentally conservative
<BR>
than ever, because they can *AFFORD* to be when the nano-santa is making
<BR>
everything for them. Instead of what you suggest, there will be environmental
<BR>
groups protesting to protect the sanctity of asteroids, Mars, Mercury, and
<BR>
Venus, making arguments about the intrinsic rights of natural rock and other
<BR>
such nonsense, and the sheeple will buy it because they can afford to not care
<BR>
about exploration, expansion, and development when everyone's belly is full and
<BR>
minds are numbed with VR delights of every kind. Doing ANY kind of non-natural
<BR>
development on earth will eventually reach mortal sin levels of blasphemy
<BR>
against the enviro-dogma.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eugene had a closer hit with his comments related to home based fuel cells.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are lots of sources of methane and ways to produce it from biomass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or the sun.  Fuel cell developers are pushing hard to get the sizes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and costs down to something home owners would install (ala heat pumps).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the costs come down enough home owners will install these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as an alternate energy source (avoiding brownouts that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strike the nationwide or global distribution nets because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't build enough reserve capacity for extreme situations)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then this may become Greg's solution to putting a smile on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your face when the sun is roasting you (I may be hot but at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least money is flowing into my bank account...).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Worth noting is -- if you trust the nationwide &quot;grid&quot; approach then why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are companies in California, such as Oracle, building their own power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facilities?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Homes can afford to lose power -- eBusinesses cannot!
</EM><BR>
<P>California based companies are building their own power facilities because of a
<BR>
couple factors, but mainly because California is currently a major power
<BR>
importer, thus at the mercy of any outage elsewhere, and Y2K taught computer
<BR>
people the wisdom that you can fix all the bugs in your own system, but if your
<BR>
electricity goes out, you are still screwed.
<BR>
<P>NIMBY attitudes are causing a large amount of resistance to new power plants,
<BR>
and if Sierra Club et al win out, Lake Powell will be drained, and the soutwest
<BR>
will be in a significant power deficit.
<BR>
<P>Seattle went through this 8 years ago when the nuke plant in Oregon was phased
<BR>
out. People bitched, whined, and complained, then bent over and proceeded to pay
<BR>
30-50% more for power over a five year period. With electricity deregulation,
<BR>
power costs are going up in California, as lower cost power in some regions is
<BR>
instead being sold to higher price markets elsewhere in the country. Oracle, et
<BR>
al are building their own power facilities to keep their own power costs down,
<BR>
guarrantee delivery, and for redundancy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The *dark horse* will be based on light harvesting methods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; currently found in plants.  Once these systems are cloned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and available as easily manipulated laboratory tools, scientists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will develop energy harvesting, storage and production systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on biotechnology based self-replicating systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Self-Replicating systems beat overcoming gravity.  No contest.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have to HAVE self replicating systems BEFORE they can beat overcoming
<BR>
gravity. How much R&amp;D do you think it will take?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The market is clear -- you can have grass that you have to mow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or you can have grass that pumps excess energy into the grid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which do you prefer?
</EM><BR>
<P>I always did hate mowing the grass.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, go back and do the calculations on how many sq meters of lawn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are required to supply the electricty needs of a city like New York.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect the suburbanites win...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I would love to see the energy storage and retrieval aspects solved by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high temperature superconductors, I suspect that they will first be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solved by biotech (with horrible losses compensated for by the large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collection areas enabled by self-replicating systems) and the subsequently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improved upon by much more efficient systems based on diamondoid nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry if I burst any balloons.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all. I'm just not kneeling at the altar of the nano-santa to solve my
<BR>
problems for me. Lorrey's Law: Any technology more than 30 years is likely to
<BR>
remain more than 30 years away for at least several generations beyond that.
<BR>
While you do some great calculations, Robert, about the *possibilities*, you
<BR>
fail to recognise that what you are calculating are in fact physical limits to
<BR>
performance, and not the most likely performance. If real life followed your
<BR>
calculations, the Roman Empire would have been settling Epsilon Eridani
<BR>
centuries ago, and we'd be living in a Dyson Cloud of personal asteroids now.
