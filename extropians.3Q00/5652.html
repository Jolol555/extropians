<EM>&gt; &gt; But attracting people to the most important job in the entire world?  How much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; leadership talent do you need for *that*?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You'd need the most talented leadership in the entire world, because the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world is more interested in Olympic games and making money than it is interested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the most important job. The most important job appeals only to the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent and conscientious brains.
</EM><BR>
<P>Amen.  You first need to convince a sufficient number of people that
<BR>
your diagnosis of the most important thing really is the most important
<BR>
and the only hope and that your design is fundamentally sound.  This is
<BR>
not a trivial task and no, not all people of sufficient caliber to be
<BR>
useful to the work will get it from the first.  
<BR>
<P>For sure the same person[s] doing the design may not be the ones to do
<BR>
the charisma and necessary explanation and persuasion though.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; My purpose, above all else, is to design the Seed.  Other people can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; persuade.  I have to complete the design.  If being charismatic requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patterns of thought that interfere with my ability to complete the design, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even if it starts taking up too much time, then forget charismatic.  I'll stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the basement and someone else will be charismatic instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you actually design the Seed, you won't need charisma. The AI Seed will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide whether (and what kind of) charisma is needed. As John R. Koza, et al.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pointed out in _Genetic progamming and Evolvable Machines_, human-competitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic programming has produced results which have been patented (p. 124).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Automatic creation has no need for charisma.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>False.  You first have to get there.  A design does not a working system
<BR>
make.  And even after the working system is in place there is a non-zero
<BR>
amount of time when the active cooperation of others is still needed. 
<BR>
After that there is an even longer period where charisma is needed in
<BR>
order to sell humanity on whatever decisions the Seed is making.  Or is
<BR>
it planned simply to give humans no choice at all?  If so, then I have
<BR>
to ask again.  In what way is this good for or even compatible with the
<BR>
nature of human beings?
