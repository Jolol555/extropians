<EM>&gt;Hitler and the Nazi's were &quot;Christian&quot; to the extent it was a cloak they
</EM><BR>
wore to ingratiate &gt;themselves with the public and consolidate their power.
<BR>
&nbsp;This was not the first time this &gt;was done in history!  Later, the
<BR>
Christian trappings were phased out for an approach of &gt;Nazism as a cult of
<BR>
personality religion with Hitler as the savior.  I have read stories of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Nazi youth party members actually being taught to pray to Hitler.

Once he actually had power, then he did believe himself to be a God to some
<BR>
degree or other.  However there is every indication that he did believe in
<BR>
God as defined by the Bible, and that belief certainly was important in the
<BR>
construction of his personal philosophy in the early years.  Later on, once
<BR>
he'd followed through on that philosophy, it didn't matter so much whether
<BR>
he justified it with God or not.
<BR>
<P>Christians can't be blamed for Hitler, he is certainly NOT representative
<BR>
of all of them, in fact he's not representative of the vast majority of
<BR>
Christians.  But that doesn't mean he wasn't a Christian nonetheless (I
<BR>
believe he was more driven by hatred, and used his Catholicism as a tool to
<BR>
justify it).  He certainly did drop the religious justification once the
<BR>
whole cult of personality set in.....
<BR>
<P>If some lunatic went around hacking ppl up in the name of Extropianism, it
<BR>
we would all agree that he wasn't representative of Extropianism.  NEITHER
<BR>
your average atheist nor theist would say Hitler was representative of most
<BR>
Christians, or that Christianity justified his actions.  
<BR>
<P>Atheists call him a Christian because that is historical fact.  Most
<BR>
Christians call him a Christian because that is historical fact.  But a few
<BR>
Christians call him an atheist because they hate atheists, and for that
<BR>
reason alone.  Ultimately, his religion wasn't a big issue for the millions
<BR>
who fought to stop him, and the millions who died trying...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Equating Nazism with Christianity OR atheism is insulting.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  And more importantly as I hope I've made clear above, incorrect.
<BR>
Note however, that the Bible provides easier justification of his crimes
<BR>
than atheism does.  Not a judgement, just an observation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Should we compare them to something biological... like cancer?
</EM><BR>
<P>Who, the Nazis?  Perhaps, haven't given much thought to that....
