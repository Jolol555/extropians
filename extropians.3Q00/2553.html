<P>
Though I found _What Art Is_ by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi
<BR>
generally agreeable and, where it was not agreeable, thought provoking, the
<BR>
last chapter leaves a lot to be desired, especially the section dubbed &quot;Art
<BR>
and the Law.&quot;  Here they start out discussing copyright protection and move
<BR>
on to censorship.  So far, so good.  The bizarre thing is that their stance,
<BR>
while not openly supporting censorship, lays the groundwork for would be
<BR>
censors.
<BR>
<P>As for the coverage itself, Torres and Kamhi appear to slip right into the,
<BR>
sad to say, typical Objectivist-as-a-conservative mode of thinking.  (This,
<BR>
unfortunately, shows us that there's a lot of truth to the notion that if
<BR>
you scratch an Objectivist, underneath you'll find a conservative.)  Instead
<BR>
of questioning laws against pornography (p296) and other prohibitions of
<BR>
self-expression such as laws against desecration of the American flag
<BR>
(pp294-5) -- regardless of whether that expression is art or whether it is
<BR>
tasteful or whether it follows alleged community standards -- they assume
<BR>
these laws are valid and show how their otherwise clear and rational view of
<BR>
art can bolster irrational and oppressive laws.
<BR>
<P>What is even stranger here is that Rand herself explicitly was against
<BR>
censorship laws, including those against pornography, for both being vague
<BR>
and injurious to a free society and individual human life.  (On the
<BR>
vagueness issue:  What, after all, are community standards?  Why should
<BR>
experts or a jury get to decide them for all of us?  Certainly, the makers
<BR>
and would be consumers of censored materials are part of the community.)
<BR>
Nowhere do they acknowledge her stance on this subject.
<BR>
<P>Though Torres and Kamhi are quick to call such things -- pornographic photos
<BR>
and flags stuffed in toilet bowls -- non-art (and rightfully so in these two
<BR>
cases) that such material is not art is not and should not be the standard
<BR>
for keeping any government's hands off.  The standard, in fact, should be
<BR>
one that is well known in the Objectivist movement: Does it violate anyone's
<BR>
individual rights.  If not, the government has no right to interfere,
<BR>
regardless of whether the work is art or even tasteful.  If it does, then it
<BR>
would not matter if it were art, it would still be something subject to
<BR>
government involvement.
<BR>
<P>The primary question in this setting then should not be &quot;Is it art?&quot; - a
<BR>
question governments should keep their hands off - but &quot;Should governments
<BR>
even be allowed to legislate or adjudicate these issues?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Though Torres and Kamhi distinguish between &quot;art and other forms of
<BR>
'expression'&quot; (p294), they do not see that basically the same legal limits
<BR>
should apply to both.  All human works (and actions) embody values in some
<BR>
way -- i.e., are forms of expression in some sense -- whether they be art,
<BR>
bridge building, or making breakfast.  Freedom of expression -- not to be
<BR>
confused with narrow legal definitions which only acknowledge it in a legal
<BR>
context -- covers all of these, from creating and experiencing art to
<BR>
running a business to style of dress (or undress) and the like.  (If only
<BR>
art is granted full protection, then the government will have a free hand
<BR>
everywhere outside the gallery, concert hall, library, and cinema.)  They
<BR>
repeated rely on very narrow, status quo definitions of law, never
<BR>
questioning whether these laws are right -- except in so far as the laws
<BR>
agree or disagree with their definitions and theory of art.
<BR>
<P>On the issue of child pornography (see pp296-7), they ignore that in the
<BR>
United States, any photograph or depiction of child nudity has time and
<BR>
again been considered by the courts to be child pornography.  E.g., nudists
<BR>
who videotape or photograph their families -- with no intention of calling
<BR>
such stuff art, much less broadcasting it on TV hanging it in a gallery --
<BR>
are often tried for child pornography.  It's another discussion here of just
<BR>
what should be done about child pornography, but such a vague legal stance
<BR>
should not be tolerated.
<BR>
<P>Torres and Kamhi even go so far to admit elsewhere that standards of quality
<BR>
are basically subjective. (p467 n35)  With this in mind, might not, say, the
<BR>
rape scene in _The Fountainhead_ be considered purely pornographic.  Is it
<BR>
thus a good candidate for banning?  This does not mean the distinction
<BR>
between pornography and art is blurry, but illustrates that within the
<BR>
current cultural context, where their remaining silent on these issues might
<BR>
lead.  Books have been banned in the US and elsewhere for less titillating
<BR>
passages.
<BR>
<P>Also, they do not consider that such laws in themselves invite people to
<BR>
challenge them, thus setting us up for making this into a politically
<BR>
charged issue.  (One writer, several years ago, even suggested banning the
<BR>
works of the Founding Fathers, so that these works would be more widely
<BR>
read.)  This distracts attention away from the matter they should be
<BR>
concerned with -- i.e., Is it art?
<BR>
<P>The policeman, the army, and the courts -- to use Rand's trinity -- have no
<BR>
role in this process -- other than to uphold individual rights.  I hope
<BR>
Torres and Kamhi see this and that, perhaps, somehow their intentions differ
<BR>
from what was actually printed in their book.  (Also, the argument that this
<BR>
is basically an esthetics book will not hold water here.  One would not
<BR>
write a book on Objectivist metaphysics and conclude with a discussion
<BR>
supporting socialism, then argue that this is just a book on metaphysics so
<BR>
it's political conclusions should not be scrutinized.)
<BR>
<P>For the record, this one section should not damn the whole book, which is a
<BR>
wonderful and detailed examination of both Rand's esthetics, Modern Art, and
<BR>
20th century esthetics.  It will, no doubt, be the source of much esthetics
<BR>
discussion in and (hopefully) out of the Objectivist movement for years to
<BR>
come.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
