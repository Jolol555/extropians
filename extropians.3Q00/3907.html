<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Under standard accounts, decisions are made by combining positions
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; on values and beliefs about facts.  One considers all the possible
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; relevant states of the world, and beliefs about facts are about how
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; likely each state is given each action, while positions on values
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are about how much one would like each state compared to the others.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Of course we have multiple problems here:
<BR>
<P>1) we must measure the current state of things, using a patently 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unreliable instrument: ourselves
<BR>
<P>2) the world is a very large and highly complex place, clearly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we can't claim to have sampled its state exhaustively. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes (I suspect pretty often) things are so muddied, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that even supposedly rational strategies are worse than a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purely randomly chosen strategy. Being super-rational might
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be bad for you, at least on the short run.
<BR>
<P>3) to choose the best outcome (assuming, the outcomes we seek are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identical, which is certifiably not true) from countless future
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trajecotries we must extrapolate these highly sketchy 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measurements using a most vague internal model of the world 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a world which is not only nonlinear and hence fundamentally 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long-term unpredictable), but often even perverse from round
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to round, as artefacted by co-evolution.
<BR>
<P>So even if we agree on the goals (which we must communicate,
<BR>
introducing another source of errors), due to above reasons we will
<BR>
not adapt a homogenous strategy (which, incidentally, would be
<BR>
predictable, and hence potentially exploitable -- just as pests blight
<BR>
the crop monoculture more easily than an alpine meadow).
<BR>
<P>Surprise, surprise: diversity is good for you.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; People on this list seem to disagree with those not here about many
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; decisions, so it can make sense to ask: do those disagreements tend
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to be more about values, or more about facts?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Of course our values are different (albeit less heterogenous than from
<BR>
a randomly picked Jane Doe), but we even tend to disagree about these
<BR>
pesky facts. Speaking of which: let's talk about guns.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; There is less scope for being &quot;right&quot; in disagreements about values.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Once we understand what we want, and opponents decide they don't want
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that, there isn't that much more to say to them.  &quot;Advocacy&quot; then
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; consists mostly in seeking out people who haven't considered the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; issue and getting them to pick sides.  And if there end up being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lots more of them than of us, we may just lose big time.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Sure, that's possible. Right now most people adhere to traditional
<BR>
values (I just had an argument with a physicist at the gym today, as a
<BR>
Christian and believer in an immortal soul he had a distinctly
<BR>
different view on the matter of transhumanism).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; There is more to say when we and opponents disagree about facts,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; because in that case we fundamentally share the same interests, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are just trying to deal with asymmetric information.  But in that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; case we should take very seriously the fact that others disagree
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; with us.  Even if they haven't articulated their reasoning to our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; satisfaction, we have also failed to do so for them, and assuming
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; they aren't stupid we have to realize that they may know things
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that show why we are wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, one should always reexamine one's beliefs. While my core values
<BR>
are probably pretty much permanently write-protected the rest of it is
<BR>
most assuredly not. I think I'm even trying to be over-flexible,
<BR>
trying to compensate for onsetting age value calcification.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; So which is it, do our disagreements with opponents tend to be more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; about values, or more about facts?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd say it can only be decided from case to case. Duh. 
<BR>
