Phil Osborn writes, regarding dental scams:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are entire books by licensed dentists that describe exactly the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; procedures that are commonly used by dentists to ensure that you will be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making many unhappy returns.  As Paul correctly points out, the average 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person stands little chance going up against a professional scam operation.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They have had lots of experience working out the bugs in their legal warfare 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kit.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is no doubt true that there are dental frauds, as in other areas.
<BR>
And these people may well be skilled at protecting themselves in the
<BR>
court system.
<BR>
<P>But to put this in the context of the thread, this is not a problem of
<BR>
&quot;big business&quot;.  These are not giant dental conglomerates, for the most
<BR>
part (some may be chains preying on the poor, I imagine).  Many of them
<BR>
are small businessmen who are short on honesty and long on greed.
<BR>
<P>The problem is not with big business.  It is with a legal system which
<BR>
benefits knowledgeable insiders.  The practice of law is tightly closed
<BR>
and regulated, which is a recipe for unfairness.
<BR>
