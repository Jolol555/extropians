<BR>
<P>I don't know to what extent Alex retains some vestige of religiousity, but
<BR>
I certainly know a way that
<BR>
an enterprising atheist could use his site. And, if he sticks to his lassiez-
<BR>
faire philosophy of  &quot;running
<BR>
things&quot; then he won't try to prevent you. The key, my friends, is subtlety.
<BR>
We've been beating them
<BR>
over the head with our atheism since the enlightenment, and we've taken
<BR>
that strategy as far as it
<BR>
will go. Faith and atheism have equilibrated, and there is still the danger
<BR>
of gridlock.
<BR>
<P>So. If you can't beat them, join them and then beat them. What if some 
<BR>
atheists,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;agnostics, or plain
<BR>
old anti-fanatics were to suddenly embrace the outward form, the trappings
<BR>
of Christianity but gently
<BR>
toning down the outdated, backwards parts that are causing everyone the
<BR>
most trouble?
<BR>
<P>Of course, most of you guys wouldn't make credible neo-Christians, and 
<BR>
probably
<BR>
wouldn't enjoy
<BR>
playing that role anyway. But it may still be productive to think about
<BR>
some kind of protocol for friend-or-foe
<BR>
recognition between neo-Christians and atheists/agnostics. So, while you're
<BR>
out there putting red
<BR>
crit marks all over the OBP site, for a little change of pace, try stating
<BR>
your beliefs in a manner that isn't
<BR>
hostile to Christianity. Try letting Christians you know win an argument
<BR>
every now and then, letting them
<BR>
think they're come a step closer to saving your soul while in fact you've
<BR>
taken them a step closer to
<BR>
Deism.
