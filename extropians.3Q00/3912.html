<P>Robotic Vision
<BR>
Two papers in this week's issue of Nature push forward the task of creating
<BR>
robots which mimic the way living creatures evolve and behave. Lipson and
<BR>
Pollack report a system which designs, 'evolves' and manufactures simple
<BR>
robots with almost no human intervention. A computer simulation using
<BR>
genetic algorithms which mutate a simple body plan was used to design robots
<BR>
capable of horizontal motion. The computer system could then test these
<BR>
simulations in the physical world by building the robots using a
<BR>
rapid-prototyping technology. In an accompanying News and Views article
<BR>
Rodney Brooks explains how this research contributes to the development of
<BR>
self-evolving machines. In a separate study Krieger et al show that robots
<BR>
programmed to co-operate in an ant-like manner are able to complete a
<BR>
foraging task in a more efficient manner than single robots. Their Khepera
<BR>
robots were found to recruit assistance from other robots, in the same way
<BR>
ants co-operate to gather food, when they came across a resource cluster.
<BR>
Both sets of robots can be seen in action by following the links to the
<BR>
supplementary information provided by the authors.

Can evolutionary principles be used to automate machine design? A new study
<BR>
evolves robot body parts and nervous systems inside a computer, and then
<BR>
physically builds them, so giving birth to real machines created by virtual
<BR>
evolution.

<BR>
Digital organisms are computer programs that are designed to mimic
<BR>
evolutionary processes by mutating and reproducing. Their use is
<BR>
controversial, but they might allow scientists to ask questions about
<BR>
evolution that cannot be answered easily by studying real organisms. Such
<BR>
organisms have been used to study how multiple mutations in the same
<BR>
organism interact, with combined effects that can be greater or less than
<BR>
the sum of their parts.

<P><EM>&gt; This story was on the front page of today's New York Times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bill Joy is quoted, he's very very unhappy. I think the reporter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who wrote the story is unhappy too, the doomsday tone in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; article is almost as strong as when the first report of Dolly was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; splashed on the front page of that same newspaper.
