<EM>&gt; &gt;Besides that, your label, I assume of the Oklahoma bomber, is disengenuous,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;especially considering he has now declared himself a supporter or disciple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Kazinski. A conservative, by definition, is a defender of the establishment, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;status quo.

<EM>&gt; When he bombed OK City, he was a fervent disciple of William Pierce's National Alliance, and gave copies of the TURNER DIARIES to many people.  He sojourned for a while at the Chriastian Identity enclave Elohim City.  When he was apprehended, he was wearing a T-shirt quoting the same Thomas Jefferson slogan that delights militia-types everywhere, about the tree of liberty needing blood watering from tyrants and patriots.  He was even too militant for the Michigan Militia, who threw him out.  If his views have changed as a result of his spending post-conviction time in the same prison as Teddy, that does not address the mindset that motivated him to practically duplicate a bombing in the TURNER DIARIES.

<P>Considering that Nazis are in fact SOCIALISTS, your claim that McVeigh and/or
<BR>
Christian Identity is 'conservative' is disengenuous at best, and a total lie at
<BR>
worst, but thats never stopped you before. In fact, the ease with which most
<BR>
socialists fit in with the eco-fanatic primitivist types demonstrates that his
<BR>
drift toward Kazynskism is not that far of a reach for him.
