<EM>&gt; &gt; I am playing devil's advocate here... why aren't all you non-US folk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; moving here? Laying aside for the moment the INS/immigration issues-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if you could move here, why not? Most people seem to believe that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have pretty much the best freedom/interesting people/cheap real estate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the boonies/cheap gas/etc. etc. Have you become too dependent on your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; free medical care that you are afraid you wouldn't be able to hack it here?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most interesting people?  I haven't heard that before.
</EM><BR>
<P>Would you prefer most-innovative? All those Euros complaining about the
<BR>
Americanization of their countries must be going on about something...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Possible reasons for not moving: being afraid of crime rates.  Preferring to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; live in dense pedestrian-oriented cities, not boonie real estate or suburban
</EM><BR>
<P>You could live in NYC if you prefer. It is quite safe if you live in a

nice area.

<P><EM>&gt; deserts.  Not wishing to partake in a culture dependent upon cars (and cheap
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gas and subsidized roads, to trade cheap shots.)  Dependency on a culture with
</EM><BR>
<P>Nonsense, you can live pretty much anywhere and still get around by bicycle
<BR>
if you really want to limit yourself to that. Or you could live in Europe
<BR>
and only go where the trains/buses go (or travel around in a dinky little
<BR>
unsafe car because the gas is taxed so much you can't afford anything safer/
<BR>
heavier). Let's face it: good cars = maximum mobility/freedom.
<BR>
<P>Dependency... what would you have us all just walk around? At some point
<BR>
we have to wed ourselves to technology and its attendant risks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; a much higher baseline concern for the quality of food.  A feeling that

<P><EM>&gt; Europeans are better educated and more interesting, or that it's easier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find those who are, in coffeehouses and such.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are willing to sacrifice so many things to have this &quot;feeling&quot; and
<BR>
the ability to visit a coffeehouse in the flesh (vs. virtual chats) then
<BR>
I think you should re-evaluate your logic.
