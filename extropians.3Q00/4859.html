<EM>&gt; &gt; But:  Just as we should go to space in part to avoid putting all our eggs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in one basket, I think we should also have some solutions that fail-safe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Some of us sentients should live in habitats that are not dependent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; advanced technology.  That come with a biosphere that is capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sustaining organic, sentient life without use of technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>How on earth (or off) would you do that?  There is no place on earth
<BR>
that is not vulnerable to natural or manmade catastrophe.  We don't have
<BR>
Vingean bobble fields after all.  And there is no place off of earth
<BR>
that supports a human compatible biosphere without the use of LOTS of
<BR>
technology.  So I am having trouble understanding what was meant.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; You got me there!  This is true.  I just wonder about the cost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Terraforming Mars without nanotech will take a long, long time and lots of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources.  Terraforming it with nanotech seems pointless, because if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can do that, then you probably don't need to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It will take a lot of tech to maintain an human supportive atmosphere
<BR>
and temperature on Mars even with nanotech.  And what is this hangup on
<BR>
human (as we now know them) life support anyway?  I would rather be able
<BR>
to morph my body or better still design one I could &quot;step into&quot; that
<BR>
best suits the environment and needs at hand.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The price of one terraformed world is high compared with many space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stations, space cities, hollowed out asteroids, and all manner of small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scale space colonies.  Space is a pretty big and cheap basket.  Mars is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small and expensive one that requires one to cook many of the eggs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beforehand.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, we can seed Mars with various low-level organics over decades
<BR>
that will produce most of the intended transformation.  That is not
<BR>
costly at all compared to building a space station, much less a space
<BR>
city.  A human mission to Mars will run at least 50 billion for the
<BR>
first dropping down to perhaps 20 billion by the third or so according
<BR>
to the most optimistic well-engineered plans I've seen.  
<BR>
<P>It will be even more expensive to set up human infrastructure in Near
<BR>
Earth space.  But subsequent Mars flights and other works will be much
<BR>
cheaper subsequently.  The cost can be defrayed by using robotics as
<BR>
much as possible to start processing the most accessible space resources
<BR>
we have, the near earth asteroids.  The NEAs contain several orders of
<BR>
magnitude more wealth than is needed to exploit space and most of the
<BR>
propulsion products, building materials and shielding and even rare
<BR>
earths needed.  But we need enough presence to start the process of
<BR>
extracting this wealth economically.  That is the big initial monetary
<BR>
priming of the pump.  But we shouldn't set up human habitats as the
<BR>
first major goals.  Humans are relatively difficult and expensive to
<BR>
support in orbit and need to be returned to earth periodically (in the
<BR>
beginning at least).  Robots can stay in space and even assemble (a
<BR>
stage or two out) more robots in space.  Only when space operations are
<BR>
already in the black can building large human habitats be justified. 
<BR>
Small habitats for highly skilled personnel needed to get the operation
<BR>
started and rolling are justifiable earlier.  
<BR>
<P>Personally I would consider turning gleisner at the first opportunity
<BR>
with high capacity core uploads soon following (preceding if possible). 
<BR>
I like human bodies but they are a terrible thing to die in or to be
<BR>
stuck exclusively in.
