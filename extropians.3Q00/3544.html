<BR>
<P>Pharmaceutical attacks against dietary supplements are heating up once
<BR>
again, and the US General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued a 47 page
<BR>
report on July 11, 2000. It falsely concludes that federal law and
<BR>
agencies provide limited assurance of the safety of functional foods and
<BR>
dietary supplements, and strongly encourages unnecessary regulation to
<BR>
&quot;reign in&quot; our industry.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00156.pdf">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00156.pdf</A> This GAO Report has been heavily
<BR>
influenced by a long time critic of the supplement industry: Center for
<BR>
Science in the Public Interest, who are staunch supporters of the FDA and
<BR>
pharmaceutical interests. International Advocates for Health Freedom
<BR>
(IAHF) warns LEF members that GAO reports of this type always lead to
<BR>
legislative attacks against the industry, and that if the Democrats should
<BR>
regain just 6 seats in the House, it would give them a majority in
<BR>
Congress.
<BR>
<P>This would put arch enemies of the supplement industry Congressmen John
<BR>
Dingle of Michigan, and Henry Waxman of California back in control of the
<BR>
House Commerce Committee and of the Health and Environment Subcommittee,
<BR>
and both have vowed to repeal DSHEA- legislation that has protected our
<BR>
access to supplements since 1994. 
<BR>
<P>Neither the German or American proposals to regulate vitamins currently on
<BR>
the table before the UN's Codex Alimentarius Committee can be accepted by
<BR>
consumers, as both severely threaten our access.
<BR>
<P>In order to learn how you can help fight CODEX, be sure to read John
<BR>
Hammell's latest Codex article about his recent trip to the Codex meeting
<BR>
in Germany at: <A HREF="http://iahf.com/codex/20000726.html">http://iahf.com/codex/20000726.html</A>  IAHF
<BR>

<BR>
<P>LEF encourages members to join the IAHF email distribution list in order
<BR>
to keep abreast of health freedom issues.  This is easily done by sending
<BR>
email to <A HREF="mailto:IAHF-subscribe@listbot.com?Subject=Re:%20LE:%20attacks%20against%20supplements%20are%20heating%20up&In-Reply-To=&lt;007701c00e75$c6d84a80$da87ecd1@neptune&gt;">IAHF-subscribe@listbot.com</A> with the word &quot;subscribe&quot; in the
<BR>
subject line, or through the listbot menu on the iahf website.

<BR>
entity, and interfaces with LEF and its members in the capacity of a
<BR>
consulting firm on health freedom issues. LEF does not necessarily agree
<BR>
with or subscribe to all views, information, and opinions expressed by
<BR>
IAHF,  John Hammell, or by groups or persons allied to IAHF, nor does LEF

<BR>
the IAHF email list as it is to subscribe, with instructions provided in
<BR>
each email. LEF appreciates John Hammell's expertise as a health freedom
<BR>
lobbyist, and Foundation members can learn much from him.]
