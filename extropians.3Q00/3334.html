Subject: Re: 18 wheeler
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;EvMick, have you ever heard of a commercial class rig that was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything other than a deisel?  Does anyone know about fire engines?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Those arent diesel, surely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>yup...they are....almost everything other than passenger vehickles are
<BR>
diesel.  It has to do with effeciency and durability....diesel engine
<BR>
technology is MATURE.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have a notion about hybrid technology for an 18 wheeler.......
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&lt;snip a whole buncha good stuff&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>sigh...you sound like me....the difference being you know what youre talking
<BR>
about....whereas i've only speculated..  I've drawn up &quot;paper concept&quot; rigs
<BR>
very similar to that for years and years....I LOVE the idea of hybrid
<BR>
electric.  It seems so unweildy to carry a trany, drive shaft..a
<BR>
differential...another drive shaft ...ANOTHER differential...
<BR>
<P>And then there's the brakes...THREE braking systems....and what does it
<BR>
do?....it changes kinetic energy to heat....HEAT...then to get going again I
<BR>
gotta burn more (increasingly expensive) fuel.  With a Hybrid electric rig
<BR>
it would seem possible to use regenerative braking ....storing some of that
<BR>
energy gained from braking and reusing it to get started again.
<BR>
<P>Four such engines and about 500 kw-hrs of batteries, which
<BR>
<EM>&gt;would weigh about 200 kg, and you would have a truck which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would perhaps be slower to accelerate than your 550 hp rig,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but would cruise the highways at 110 kph without difficulty.
</EM><BR>
<P>My rig isn't all that quick to accelerate....0 to 60 in fifteen minutes is
<BR>
appropriate....it's claim to fame is continuous, long term
<BR>
pulling......running a diesel for days at a time without ever shutting it
<BR>
off is common...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Furthermore, it would be extremely reliable, as each of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;four i.c. engines and each of 6 electric motors would be completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;independent.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you considered a fuel cell?  Will a fuel cell run off ethanol?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Looks like a scheme we could get the failed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Algore administration or the failed George W. administration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to subsidize with tax breaks for fermentation-grade-corn growers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Good plan....but it ain't gonna work.
<BR>
<P>AlGore and Shrub are both politicians.....all theyre looking for is to GET
<BR>
elected...then all of a sudden their priorities change...
