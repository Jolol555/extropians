Press Release  (Copied From Plant Tissue Culture List):
<BR>
<P>DR. EVANGELINA VILLEGAS AND DR. SURINDER K. VASAL AWARDED $250,000 
<BR>
MILLENNIUM WORLD FOOD PRIZE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF &quot;MIRACLE MAIZE&quot; 
<BR>
--QUALITY PROTEIN MAIZE (QPM)--WHICH IS COUNTERING MALNUTRITION AND 
<BR>
SAVING THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF CHILDREN WORLDWIDE
<BR>
<P>First woman Laureate was part of a team that overcame skepticism 
<BR>
about their research to produce protein enriched corn, known as 
<BR>
Quality Protein Maize or QPM.
<BR>
<P>DES MOINES, IOWA, USA (September 7, 2000) - Ambassador Kenneth M. 
<BR>
Quinn, President of The World Food Prize Foundation, announced today 
<BR>
that the $250,000 Millennium World Food Prize has been awarded to 
<BR>
biochemist Dr. Evangelina Villegas of Mexico and plant geneticist Dr. 
<BR>
Surinder K. Vasal of India.  Dr. Villegas is the first woman ever to 
<BR>
receive The World Food Prize.
<BR>
<P>Quinn said that Dr. Villegas and Dr. Vasal will be honored first at a 
<BR>
special ceremony on October 12 in the historic Iowa State Capitol 
<BR>
Building in Des Moines and again at a luncheon in New York City on 
<BR>
October 16 - World Food Day - featuring remarks by
<BR>
U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard C. Holbrooke and 
<BR>
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman.
<BR>
<P>The World Food Prize, referred to informally as the &quot;Nobel Prize for 
<BR>
Food,&quot; has been awarded to Drs. Villegas and Vasal for their success 
<BR>
in developing maize with both higher quality protein and desirable 
<BR>
agronomic characteristics. The two scientists collaborated on this 
<BR>
problem for almost three decades at the International Wheat and Maize 
<BR>
Improvement Center in Mexico. Their painstaking scientific detective 
<BR>
work finally achieved the breakthrough discovery of how significant 
<BR>
amounts of additional protein could be added to low nutrition corn, 
<BR>
thus producing enriched &quot;miracle maize.&quot;  However, even as their 
<BR>
testing process was finally producing results, such research lost 
<BR>
support in some scientific circles.
<BR>
<P>Despite a cut off in funding, Drs. Villegas and Vasal nonetheless 
<BR>
persistently continued to pursue their goal. Thanks to their 
<BR>
tenacity, today hundreds of millions of people in developing 
<BR>
countries who depend on maize as a primary food source, and as a 
<BR>
livestock feed, have access to a high nutrition food. Known as 
<BR>
Quality Protein Maize, or QPM, this grain has significantly improved 
<BR>
the quality and quantity of food in the world, underlying criteria 
<BR>
for The World Food Prize.  In a world where nearly one seventh of the 
<BR>
total population (well over 800 million people) is chronically 
<BR>
malnourished, the significance of QPM cannot be overstated.  (A 
<BR>
detailed account of the work of these two scientists is attached to 
<BR>
this release).
<BR>
<P>The successful collaboration of Drs. Villegas and Vasal is hailed by 
<BR>
researchers as one of the most innovative team approaches to 
<BR>
conventional plant breeding ever carried out to achieve a common 
<BR>
goal. Dr. Normal E. Borlaug, Nobel Laureate and World Food Prize 
<BR>
Founder, states: &quot;I'm pleased that the efforts of Drs. Vasal and 
<BR>
Villegas are being recognized by the World Food Prize.  Their efforts 
<BR>
in developing QPM, working through times when QPM research was quite 
<BR>
unpopular, has resulted in significant inroads to alleviating 
<BR>
malnourishment and poverty in developing countries.  What they have 
<BR>
done has inspired other gut-fighting teams of scientists who labor to 
<BR>
serve human beings, not just as an academic exercise.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Former President Jimmy Carter, Member of the World Food Prize 
<BR>
Council of Advisors, adds: &quot;Dr. Villegas and Dr. Vasal not only 
<BR>
achieved a remarkable breakthrough on maize quality, but their 
<BR>
efforts to teach and train others in furthering QPM adoption are 
<BR>
exemplary.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;John Ruan, chairman of The World Food Prize Foundation, commented: 
<BR>
&quot;Food security brought about by QPM is a fundamental advance to help 
<BR>
the poor break the cycle of poverty and malnutrition.  We salute Dr. 
<BR>
Villegas and Dr. Vasal for their contribution to humanity.&quot;
