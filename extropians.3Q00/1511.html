<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20spiritual%20hyperspace&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGOEOHFLAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.org</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of my earliest memories is of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day when the pigs broke free of their pen while I was outside playing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fairly far from our house. When they saw me they rushed at me in a big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; herd grunting their war chants. I was able to climb partially up a tree,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not before one of them tried very hard to bite off my foot.
</EM><BR>
<P>How scary!  The javelinas (native N. American pig-like creatures) have had
<BR>
me up a tree before.  I've seen them rip a dogs' guts out, so I didn't want
<BR>
to take my chances on the ground with them when they seemed to be in a
<BR>
vicious mood.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've often found baby birds who've fallen from their nests. Sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm able to lift them back up without touching them with my skin. Other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; times, heeding the advice of my parents given so long ago, I leave them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the adult birds to decide what to do.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's usually what I do too.  In the case of Pigeon Pi, though, I was
<BR>
afraid to leave her, because there was a cat lurking around.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Formal studies are never a prerequisite for acceptable discussion. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hope I didn't give the impression otherwise.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you didn't; but you did sort of give the impresssion that it would take
<BR>
a formal study to convince you that humans and non-humans can communicate.
<BR>
It may be that I'm overly sensitive.
<BR>
<P>About the Latin words, I dislike pretentiousness.  It's not that I have
<BR>
anything against using Latin words, or any other sort of word, when it gives
<BR>
a clearer or more interesting meaning to what a person is saying.  But when
<BR>
a person says &quot;domestic canine&quot; instead of &quot;dog&quot; they're not gaining
<BR>
anything, and it comes across as pretentious.  (canine is derived from the
<BR>
Latin caninus) This is just my bias.  Maybe some people would prefer
<BR>
&quot;domestic canine.&quot;
