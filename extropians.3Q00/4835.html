<EM>&gt; I'm not sure that David's transparency would necessarily fix the IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem, anyway.  In a truly transparent world, shouldn't I be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look over David's shoulder as he types up his latest novel?  Shouldn't I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have access to it in the files on his computer?  And if I buy the book,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shouldn't my friends be able to read it at the same time that I do,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; via my wearable webcam?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect that David would say that the answer to all these questions is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no, because as I said I think his intention in proposing transparency was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to save IP, not destroy it.  I wonder how others would see the relation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between a transparent society and intellectual property.  Do they go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; together, or are they incompatible and contradictory?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that kind of total transparency is likely. People won't
<BR>
voluntarily allow cameras into their homes that they can't turn off, or
<BR>
allow everyone to access their hard drives across the Internet. I can't
<BR>
really imagine that the technology necessary to achieve total
<BR>
transparency without consent will arrive soon enough to make a difference
<BR>
to the IP issue. 
<BR>
<P>David Brin himself claims that he is interested in transparency as
<BR>
protection against abuse by the powerful. I don't think it's the right
<BR>
solution to that problem, but it seems like a more plausible motivation.
