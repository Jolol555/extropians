<EM>&gt; &gt; There was a recent study that found that most people who DON'T know a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; subject will rate themselves as expert in it.  Although there was some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; correlation with people who really knew the subject from high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to low levels
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of competence, those with no competence rated themselves as experts!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's pretty surprising.  Presumably these weren't technical subjects?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Few people would claim expertise in paleontology or cosmology.  They might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel they knew a lot about politics, sports management and economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy though, when in fact they were ignorant.  Do you remember any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more details?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, they did include technical subjects.  I was particularly
<BR>
interested in computer-related technology.  I believe I exaggerated when I
<BR>
implied that people with zero knowledge rated themselves as expert.  I think
<BR>
that zero knowledge people rated themselves as not knowing a subject.  But
<BR>
those with small amounts of knowledge, i.e. just introduced to a subject,
<BR>
felt the grasped the basics and could extrapolate immediately.  The newbies
<BR>
rated themselves as experts, even in technical subjects like new physics
<BR>
theories, psychology, etc.  Newbies to the Internet thought they new it all
<BR>
in a few days.  Newbies to new physics theories were expounding on string
<BR>
theories and black-holes after watching a few Nova episodes.  Beginners in
<BR>
V-Basic thought they were crack programmers.  It was only after weeks of
<BR>
intensive study that they began to realize how little they know about a
<BR>
topic.
<BR>
<P>So the learning curve looked something like this (from memory):
<BR>
0 knowledge - rates selves as not knowing subject
<BR>
little knowledge - rates selves as being expert
<BR>
some knowledge - rates selves as good
<BR>
medium knowledge - rates selves as medium
<BR>
lots of knowledge - rates selves as superior
<BR>
expert knowledge - rates selves as expert
<BR>
<P>The krux of the findings was that people with a little bit of knowledge
<BR>
believed that they had learned the entire subject.  It took additional
<BR>
knowledge to get beyond the basics and realize how many questions remained.
