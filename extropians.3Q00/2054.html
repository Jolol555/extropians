<P>
there's also a Methodist meaning that might be on the mark:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/2/0,5716,84872+1+82688,00.html">http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/2/0,5716,84872+1+82688,00.html</A>
<BR>
&quot;circuit of congregations&quot;
<BR>
<P>..and that might be a reference to a loverman &quot;getting in there&quot; under
<BR>
color of authority, too.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;circuit rider 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Methodist ministerial role that was originated in England by John
<BR>
Wesley. The first of
<BR>
&nbsp;the American circuit riders was Robert Strawbridge, who arrived in the
<BR>
colonies in
<BR>
&nbsp;1764. A few years later Wesley sent missionaries to the American
<BR>
colonies, but most of
<BR>
&nbsp;them departed when revolution threatened. One who remained was Francis
<BR>
Asbury,
<BR>
&nbsp;who, as Wesley's general assistant, was responsible for organizing the
<BR>
circuits.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Each circuit of congregations--sometimes comprising as many as 25 or 30
<BR>
meeting
<BR>
&nbsp;places--was under the supervision of a Methodist conference preacher
<BR>
who might have
<BR>
&nbsp;several lay assistants. Any young man who could preach and was willing
<BR>
to ride a
<BR>
&nbsp;horse for weeks over wild country might become an assistant and finally
<BR>
a circuit rider.
<BR>
&nbsp;Circuit riders numbered about 100 by the end of the American
<BR>
Revolution. The salary
<BR>
&nbsp;was $64 a year until 1800, when it was raised to $100, with the horse
<BR>
furnished.
<BR>
&nbsp;There were few actual meetinghouses; church services usually were held
<BR>
in cabins, in
<BR>
&nbsp;barrooms, or outdoors.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Circuit riders were a religious and moral force along the frontier and
<BR>
in rural areas of
<BR>
&nbsp;the South, and they were largely responsible for the propagation of
<BR>
Methodism
<BR>
&nbsp;throughout the United States. The practice was soon adopted by other
<BR>
denominations,
<BR>
&nbsp;too.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
