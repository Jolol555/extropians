<EM>&gt; &gt; you think AI will be bribable?  Why should it *care* whether it is

<EM>&gt; First of all, AI does not equal SI. The question of the thread is &quot;Why would AI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to be friendly?&quot; not &quot;Why would SI want to be friendly?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AI will grow in intelligence just as any entity (including a human) does. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines (our Mind Children) become more and more intelligent, those that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; display unfriendly characteristics (unlike human children) can be terminated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deletion.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>If the AI is in fact as much of an autonomous intelligent being as you
<BR>
yourself are then deletion of the AI is just as much an execution/murder
<BR>
as is the same act performed on you or I.  If we insist on treating
<BR>
beings as bright and adaptive as ourselves as things that will
<BR>
percipitate a human-AI conflict very quickly.
