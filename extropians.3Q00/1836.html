<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A PC version of the old EMPIRE game can be freely downloaded from:-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://home.att.net/~wgb/">http://home.att.net/~wgb/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is indeed a different game, written by Walter Bright, who was a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; year behind me in college and roomed across the hall from me.  Walter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wrote the original version of his Empire in Fortran back in 1977 or so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Later he co-authored a version for the PC which appeared in the late 80s.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But it is not the same Empire game that people have been talking about.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well Geez Hal, get on the horn and see if ol' Walter has the original
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; functioning anywhere or available... times a'wastin'... Please? ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>It looks like he has the PC version available from the links at the
<BR>
bottom of the page above - I was able to get the data but I don't have
<BR>
a PC handy that it is likely to run on.
<BR>
<P>It's a real blast of nostalgia for me to read Walter's description of the
<BR>
history of Empire on those pages.  Walter was actually one of the people
<BR>
who helped establish my political orientation, he and his roommate Mark.
<BR>
They were the hard core libertarians in the dorm, and we'd spend hours
<BR>
debating politics in the late night bull sessions where it seems like
<BR>
I spent most of my college life.
<BR>
<P>I made a lot of connections at Caltech with people who have gone on to
<BR>
be very successful.  Robin suggested some time back that this is what
<BR>
you are really paying for when you go to an expensive college, at least
<BR>
as an undergraduate.  The education is not really all that different.
<BR>
But you meet faculty members and students who will be able to help you
<BR>
in your career for the rest of your life.  I've had many advantages over
<BR>
the years from having attended a school like that.
<BR>
