</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;In New Mexico, Hispanic farmers were initially interested in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;higher-yielding corns ... One by one, the farmers returned to growing
</EM><BR>
the corns
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;favored by their wives. To this day over much of New Mexico, blue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Pueblo flours and flints are grown for tortillas and cornmeal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why not produce products that preserve the best of existing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products (taste,color,texture,open pollination) but improve them by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increasing their resistance to things like drought, insects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (without pesticides), and improve the overall yield.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I'd like to hope that research would move in this direction; but at least
<BR>
in my part of the world,  the majority of the people don't  seem to care
<BR>
much about the quality of their food.  I live in a rural area where
<BR>
almost everyone has garden space, and yet most people don't even keep
<BR>
small vegetable gardens. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;When fresh produce is made available to homeless people, they don't want
<BR>
it--too much trouble to prepare it (this remains true even if kitchens
<BR>
are made available for their use). They'd rather eat out of cans. 
<BR>
Homeful people are often in too much of a rush to think of what they eat,
<BR>
spending long hours at work and commuting and taking kids to
<BR>
extracurricular activities and shopping and picking up the dry cleaning
<BR>
and doing housekeeping in odd moments.  They grab some takeout food or
<BR>
eat frozen dinners.
<BR>
<P>In neighboring Austin there is Whole Foods, which has now expanded into a
<BR>
nationwide chain; and Central Market.  At both of these stores one can
<BR>
choose from a wide variety of fairly fresh vegetables; but the prices are
<BR>
outrageous.  The people who shop at these stores make up only a tiny
<BR>
faction of the total population of the area.
<BR>
<P>As one who grows heirloom corns such as Texas Honey June (sweet corn) and
<BR>
Texas Gourdseed (good soft corn for tortillas), and my own variety of
<BR>
field corn which I've bred especially for my climate and soil,  I readily
<BR>
agree with the New Mexican farmers' wives about the taste and texture of
<BR>
the old varieties.  Until enough people share that view to make it worth
<BR>
while for commercial seed companies to develop better tasting food crops,
<BR>
the only solution seems to be for more people to grow gardens and
<BR>
preserve the old varieties, which are disappearing at an alarming rate.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, I'm glad to see research being done on at least improving the
<BR>
nutritional value of food (although as I've mentioned before, I think
<BR>
there's a chance that some of the GM foods are not metabolized properly).
<BR>
