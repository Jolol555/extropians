<P>
<EM>&gt; This argument is getting boring... &quot;You can't own it, you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; track it, you can't control it, so why even bother?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which is a defeatist attitude.  There are two distinct issues here:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) is it -desirable- to own it? and b) is it -possible- to own it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Arguing against 'b' is not a good way to argue against 'a.'  If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *is* desirable then we should get more imaginative about making it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.  If it's *not* desirable, then you should argue that position.
</EM><BR>
<P>You apparently reading different arguments than I am.  I agree, of
<BR>
course, that if something is desirable we should work toward it rather
<BR>
than resigning ourselves to its opposite.  As an Extropian, after all,
<BR>
I'm fighting against the ultimate cliche inevitabilities of death and
<BR>
taxes; why would I not fight against information sharing if I thought
<BR>
it too was evil?  Clearly, I don't think that, and I don't use
<BR>
inevitability as a reason for supporting my ethical point of view.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we decide we want to be able to protect something that comes out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; our own head, then we look for ways to do so. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've never argued against that either, so long as the methods are
<BR>
technological rather than government force.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You claim that encryption will be only a minor annoyance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the future: if that's true, then we've got some big issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who has claimed this?  Certainly not I, or anyone I remember in
<BR>
this discussion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My vision of a desirable future includes a fully networked frictionless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information matrix and lots of secure nodes of (nearly?) absolute privacy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds good to me.  I haven't heard anyone arguing against that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Individuals should be empowered with the means to control their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information, including the ability to release it into a frictionless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medium and let it replicate indefinitely.
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They should be able to make the determination of what stays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; private and what becomes public.
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely.  But once they make it public, /they shouldn't be able
<BR>
to change their decision/ and enforce that change of mind with guns.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And in the absence of good technological security, do I think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we should collectively agree to protect that information through legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means?  Absolutely.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't like arguing counterfactuals since there /will/ be technological
<BR>
means, but I'm still not clear what you mean by &quot;protect&quot; here.  Do you
<BR>
mean some way of creating the legal fiction that a certain piece of
<BR>
information has never been &quot;released&quot; (an odd concept, but one I might
<BR>
be able to support) or the state of current IP law, which tries to have
<BR>
it both ways, both publically released and &quot;protected&quot; from competition?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; People always get up in arms about this: &quot;I don't want government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bureaucracy interfering with my freedom!&quot;  But humans have always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understood the importance of social contracts, ever since the first time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we figured out that the right of your fist ends where the right of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nose begins.
</EM><BR>
<P>How is a social contract necessary to redress torts like this?  Doesn't
<BR>
civil law (which can be privately produced) address this well?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A recent farcical 'fairytale' posted to this list perpetrated the idea that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we needed to return to simpler times-- if only we were to get rid of all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those stuffy &quot;laws&quot; then we could live in peace and harmony with each other,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and dance with unicorns and what not.  (Hello entropy?)
</EM><BR>
<P>You'll have to give me a pointer to that one...never saw it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I anticipate us requiring more intricate rule sets to enable us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully interact with each other in the future and this is simply a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; testament to the increasing complexity and depth of those interactions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Complexity does not /necessarily/ indicate progress.  Sometimes simpler
<BR>
is better.  Sometimes it's not.  But that statement, whether made by you
<BR>
or me, has no content until you talk about /specifically/ which
<BR>
complications you favor and /why/.
<BR>
