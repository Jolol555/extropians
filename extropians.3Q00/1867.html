<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,37610,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,37610,00.html</A> describes some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of Greg Benford's visions of future software, a marketing war between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems that try to build dossiers about consumers that are used for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;customized sales pitches, and interface software which will attempt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;protect consumers' privacy.  Benford also predicts the advent of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;comfy culture&quot;, a futuristic world where everything is customized to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;match the preferences of users.  In his vision, the natural world will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem boring and unresponsive compared to cities, where everything will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be alive and alluring.  Sounds like it was quite a talk.  I wonder if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Benford has any essays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elaborating on these points in more detail?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the wired.com site article: &quot;In this scenario, the wall, Benford said, 
</EM><BR>
will be picking up your shopping history through an EMID (electromagnetic 
<BR>
identification), even though you're trying to deflect its pitch by emitting 
<BR>
a false signal.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I would be interested in further detail on this and other details of 
<BR>
Benford's future scenarios.  I had an article published in &quot;Amiga User 
<BR>
International&quot; magazine circu 1995 in which I described in more detail how 
<BR>
passive transponder chips or the like could be used to support an &quot;overlaid&quot; 
<BR>
reality, in which a lightweight hmd would project information overlaid on 
<BR>
the visual field, triggered by ID signals pointing to the actual info source 
<BR>
via wireless net - or, more likely in the case Benford cites of the smart 
<BR>
wall, telling your wireless PDA to tune to a local frequency for shortrange 
<BR>
RF, thus saving on download times.
<BR>
<P>(Unfortunately, AUI screwed up everything for that issue (they went out of 
<BR>
business shortly thereafter) and falsely attributed both of my articles for 
<BR>
that issue to Michael Hanish, who is a personal friend of mine and currently 
<BR>
writes for TV Technology magazine.  They never paid either of us as well.)
