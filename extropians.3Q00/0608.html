<EM>&gt; &gt;Mae West could not get photographed to save her life these days,
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure but Mae West was a comic, not a classic beauty of her day,
<BR>
sorta like Bette Midler today.  {8^D  Bette is funny, but I wouldnt
<BR>
consider her beautiful.

<EM>&gt; The waist/hip ratio might be one of those things that we tend to seek

<P>I may have an explanation for this.  Surely sexual preferences are
<BR>
hard wired in our brains, by some mysterious means.  Isnt it curious
<BR>
that in general men prefer women who are thinner than the average
<BR>
woman, but women prefer men who are closer to the average man?
<BR>
First of all, in your opinion, is this observation correct?  If so, then:
<BR>
<P>We can imagine a population of chimps wherein there is initially
<BR>
no overall preference for females with narrow waist, that is to say,
<BR>
half the males prefer females with small waist, half the males prefer
<BR>
females with large waist.  Over many generations of chimpy
<BR>
behavior, the thin-female-preferrers would have a slightly greater
<BR>
chance of passing on his hard-wired preference, for the thin
<BR>
waisted females are less pregnant, that is less likely to be *already
<BR>
carrying* the offspring of a different male.  Over time, the population
<BR>
might as a whole prefer the thins.
<BR>
<P>I do not see any correlation for female sexual selection of males,
<BR>
so the chimp population would not necessarily select for fat or
<BR>
thin males.
<BR>
<P>I have written a little Monte Carlo sim to model this phenomenon,
<BR>
but I am not sure if it is valid.  Still working it.
<BR>
<P>If this can happen in chimps, could it not occur in humans?
<BR>
What say ye?  spike
