<P><EM>&gt;I am, however, now active on the other end of the size scale.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;This is to make teleoperated robots in the micro world.  When
<BR>
I get this together, teams of workers will be able to get into
<BR>
their VR stations and be transported to a
<BR>
construction site that is actually deep inside a scanning electron
<BR>
microscope.&lt;
<BR>
<P>Visionary idea.  I would imagine that the architecture for the
<BR>
teams of workers would be quite fascinating, and even stunning
<BR>
to look at.  
<BR>
<P>I haven't read this book _Cellular Robotics and Micro Robotic
<BR>
Systems_ by T Fukuda &amp; T Ueyama (Nagoya Univ.), but references
<BR>
I did read references about it and it covers ideas on cellular
<BR>
robotics and micro robotic systems with pointers to concepts
<BR>
stemming from the organic architecture of the physical body.
<BR>
&nbsp;An aspect of this I like a lot is focus on swarm intelligence
<BR>
and emphasis on the technology of micro robotics.
<BR>
<P>Regarding telepresence, I enjoyed reading the synopsis below
<BR>
by an unknown author:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The term telepresence is often encountered in the literature
<BR>
and it deserves special attention. Three definitions of the term
<BR>
telepresence are in common use: the simple, the cybernetic, and
<BR>
the experiential. In the simple definition, telepresence refers
<BR>
to the ability to operate in a remote or computer-mediated world
<BR>
generally. In the cybernetic definition, telepresence is an index
<BR>
of the quality of the human-machine interface. In the experiential
<BR>
definition, telepresence means a mental state in which a user
<BR>
feels physically present within the remote world.
<BR>
<P>The critical difference between cybernetic and experiential telepresence
<BR>
is that the cybernetic definition refers to efficiency while
<BR>
the experiential definition refers to something experienced by
<BR>
the human user. Cybernetic telepresence is the projection of
<BR>
human capability into a remote world and experiential telepresence
<BR>
is the projection of human consciousness into a computer-mediated
<BR>
world.
<BR>
<P>Although the importance of experiential telepresence is widely
<BR>
accepted, some authors question the value of the concept because
<BR>
of the paucity of data demonstrating the existence of the phenomenon
<BR>
or its relationship to task performance. Experiential telepresence
<BR>
may also be criticized from the perspective of scientific parsimony:
<BR>
although it postulates an additional construct lacking in the
<BR>
cybernetic definition (the illusion of presence), it does not
<BR>
seem to provide a more powerful explanation of observations of
<BR>
teleoperator performance.&quot;  (unknown author)
