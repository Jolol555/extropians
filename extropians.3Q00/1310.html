<P>William Shakespeare's HAMLET is said to have been based on an older play,
<BR>
possibly by Tomas Kyd; the older play may have been taken directly from
<BR>
Danish legend or from some other intermediary source. Great stories thrive
<BR>
in new times and places.
<BR>
<P>THE WHITE ABACUS gives a thoroughly enjoyable answer to the question of what
<BR>
Shakespeare might have done with HAMLET's plot and characters, given the
<BR>
chance to transport them to a time when minds are connected through the
<BR>
Gestell and hex-gates allow instantaneous access to any point in the galaxy.
<BR>
For our characters, we find in this far-future setting a wide range of
<BR>
body-types to choose from, including the casque-headed, artistically
<BR>
sensitive ai; the macho-anachronistic hu who believe that their soul resides
<BR>
in their vermiform appendices; and the Genetics who take on a surprising
<BR>
array of organic forms. Mind-boggling future technologies, some inherited
<BR>
from science fiction forbears and others newly invented, play their critical
<BR>
part throughout the book.
<BR>
<P>The book preserves HAMLET's immortal elements of power-lust, murder,
<BR>
betrayal, madness, and revenge, while adding some fascinating plot twists of
<BR>
its own. The tale is told with language as startlingly delightful as
<BR>
Shakespeare's: narrative that paints incredibly detailed sensory images and
<BR>
is at the same time brilliantly comical; and dialogue that is at times
<BR>
hilarious, at other times thought provoking. To fully appreciate certain
<BR>
humorous references, the reader must have some knowledge of classical
<BR>
science fiction, as well as classics in general.
<BR>
<P>This book is probably best approached as a total immersion Experience, where
<BR>
the reader floats along with the words on one level, enjoying the scenery
<BR>
and the ever-present soundtrack; and at another level thinks critically
<BR>
about what she's reading and laughs aloud when, for example, she notices
<BR>
that Aaron Copland's APPALACHIAN SPRING is playing through a receiver in the
<BR>
ai Ratio's head as se stands in the middle of Death Valley, looking out over
<BR>
the salt flats.
<BR>
<P>My only regret is that I'll never again have the opportunity to read THE
<BR>
WHITE ABACUS for the first time.
