<EM>&gt; &gt; Pretty exclusive club, to make an educated professional jump through
</EM><BR>
hoops
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for membership, while a substantial fraction of its current membership
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enjoy professional wrestling and can't locate Europe on a map.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While I understand the sentiment, I've often thought that citizenship
</EM><BR>
should not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be automajically conferred with birth, but earned through merit
</EM><BR>
(Pournelle's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; concept of the planet Sparta being such an example), and you could argue
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; heritable citizenship is technically inconsistent with the Constitution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prohibition on inherited titles, your statement forgets the logic that
</EM><BR>
once you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; are in, you are in for life, and anyone that is out, is out. Of course,
</EM><BR>
some
<BR>
<EM>&gt; members get by 'on scholarship'.... ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Nice to quibble over such things, but how should citizenship be conferred?
<BR>
And should noncitizens be subject to the government, if one believes in
<BR>
government with the consent of the governed?  (If one does not, that's
<BR>
another story.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Kinda like being appointed to the Supreme Court, once you are there,
</EM><BR>
there's not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; much they can do to you. Notice how Clarence Thomas doesn't give a rats
</EM><BR>
patooty
<BR>
<EM>&gt; what NAACP, et al think of him (not that he cared much before), but there
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing they can do to him once he passed the 'high tech lynching' the
</EM><BR>
media put
<BR>
<EM>&gt; forth.
</EM><BR>
<P>But Thomas does care.  Note how before he was appointed, he was very much
<BR>
for Natural Law, but during the appointment process he turned into a
<BR>
pragmatist very quickly.  I guess his avowed principles were only so much
<BR>
window dressing.  (Or, if he's returned to them, they are only to be held
<BR>
when they are convenient.)  This tells me he is not independent minded.  He
<BR>
just caters to a different audience than the NAACP.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
