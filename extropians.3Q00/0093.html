<P>
In the never-ending discussion of &quot;socialized medicine doesn't create a 
<BR>
slothful underclass&quot; vs. &quot;people can and should take care of themselves&quot; 
<BR>
views that comes up here from time to time, I'm once again struck by a factor 
<BR>
that seems to lie at the crux of the dispute, i.e. the extent to which people 
<BR>
seem to need government-mediated social services because, by the time they 
<BR>
NEED them, they in fact haven't made provision for private supply of those 
<BR>
services.  Advocates of a government-mediated &quot;social safety net&quot; look at 
<BR>
society as it is, and see that there are lots of people who are in need of 
<BR>
things like medical care or inter-job income support or job-skills training 
<BR>
or disability income, but who have made no private provision for these key 
<BR>
services.  They feel that if the government doesn't provide for them through 
<BR>
some tax-funded set of social services, no one will, and such people will 
<BR>
become an even greater burden to society.  Opponents of government providing 
<BR>
such services at taxpayer expense point out that it is possible to imagine a 
<BR>
system in which such services are provided on a near-universal basis by 
<BR>
private insurance or other market mechanisms of some kind and ask why they 
<BR>
should be asked to pay for the lack of foresight of the people who have 
<BR>
failed to take advantage of such services.  
<BR>
<P>I see the people having this on-going discussion talking past each other.  
<BR>
One side looks at things as they are and feels they are simply being 
<BR>
pragmatic, if not empathetic.  The other side looks at things as they should 
<BR>
be and feels they are arguing against the creation of disincentives to 
<BR>
individual responsibility.
<BR>
<P>One piece that seems to be missing from both sides is a realization of the 
<BR>
importance of education.  For purposes of discussion, consider the US as the 
<BR>
exemplar of laissez-faire.  More than any other country, the US sets an 
<BR>
expectation that people should provide for themselves.  (Yes, there are MANY 
<BR>
exceptions - Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid - but compared to most of 
<BR>
the rest of the developed world, the US social contract places responsibility 
<BR>
on the individual.)  But how good a job do we do in the US of INFORMING 
<BR>
people of the terms of the social contract when it matters - when they are 
<BR>
young, string and healthy, with the ability to enroll in private support 
<BR>
mechanisms for social services on an actuarially sound basis?  The answer: 
<BR>
Terrible.
<BR>
<P>Put simply, if you expect people to take care of themselves, you have to tell 
<BR>
them this fact, early and often.  And you have to explain to them &quot;how things 
<BR>
work&quot;, &quot;what the deal is&quot;.  Sure, the brightest people figure this out on 
<BR>
their own, in time for them to do something about it.  And people who are 
<BR>
lucky enough to have good parents get the education they need about how the 
<BR>
world they will live in as adults works before they will be expected to make 
<BR>
decisions based on that social contract.  Likewise, people who show 
<BR>
economically valuable talents early enough in life will have the means of 
<BR>
private support thrust on them by potential employers or business partners, 
<BR>
i.e. private health and disability insurance, savings support and the like; 
<BR>
all as &quot;benefits&quot; of their employment.  But even for the folks in the great 
<BR>
middle of the bell curve of abilities, getting enrolled in a good system of 
<BR>
private social support mechanisms early enough to live life with reasonable 
<BR>
security is a real problem in the US.  For people at the bad end of the bell 
<BR>
curve, enrollment is out of the question: They don't get clued in about the 
<BR>
simple facts of how the system works in time to provide for themselves.
<BR>
<P>The average 18-year old in the US doesn't have a clue about needing to get 
<BR>
private health and disability insurance and that they should begin 
<BR>
accumulating capital as a cushion against the vagaries of life.  If they're 
<BR>
lucky, average kids begin to get some inkling of what's expected of them in 
<BR>
their 20s or 30s in a piecemeal fashion and take some halting, inconsistent 
<BR>
steps to do something about it some time in their life.  Kids who fall below 
<BR>
average in intelligence or opportunity NEVER get clued in to the basic terms 
<BR>
of the social contract.
<BR>
<P>This failure of education takes place at many levels.  The biggest culprits 
<BR>
are the schools.  For all practical purposes, there is no teaching of the 
<BR>
basic terms of the social contract.  If you grew up the US public school 
<BR>
system and graduated from high school with any formal exposure to education 
<BR>
in basic life skills like managing finances or the need for health and 
<BR>
disability insurance, you are the extremely rare exception.  But this problem 
<BR>
exists at every level.  Our politicians almost NEVER talk about the terms of 
<BR>
the basic social contract.  Perhaps because they have by definition been 
<BR>
successful in life, they just don't realize how truly ignorant of how the 
<BR>
world works most people are in their crucial younger years.  Unions and 
<BR>
&quot;public interest groups&quot; tend to target isolated issues, and usually only 
<BR>
after the particular segment of society with which they are concerned has 
<BR>
either fallen through the cracks of the social contract or needs some support 
<BR>
in one particular area of their lives.  Advertising by insurance companies 
<BR>
and other financial institutions is perhaps the most effective mechanism we 
<BR>
have for this kind of education, but unfortunately this source of information 
<BR>
is presented in a fragmented fashion and is targeted primarily at the most 
<BR>
economically successful segment of the population, i.e. at the people who 
<BR>
need the EDUCATION the least.
<BR>
<P>I don't propose any solution for this problem here.  I just think this is a 
<BR>
crucial factor in the debate that isn't addressed adequately by either side.
