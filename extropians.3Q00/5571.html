<P>But why this mathematical representation of &quot;our knowledge&quot;
<BR>
is characterized by complex quantities? We know that Wigner's
<BR>
&nbsp;time reversal operator changes the sign of the imaginary part 
<BR>
of the state-vector elements. Thus, the complex nature of  
<BR>
the state-vector may be a manifestation of its time structure.
<BR>
Is Born's probability law telling us that the probability of a particular 
<BR>
observation is linked to the time reverse of a state-vector component?
<BR>
In the paper below (about Clifford algebra) there is
<BR>
something that might be about this question (ch. 5).

<P>In Sheldon Goldstein's site there is an interesting debate.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~oldstein/papers/qtwoe/qtwoe.html">http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~oldstein/papers/qtwoe/qtwoe.html</A>

- Anton Zeilinger says that the very austerity of the Copenhagen
<BR>
interpretation, unsurpassed by that of any other interpretation,
<BR>
speaks very much in its favor. Its basic attitude toward the
<BR>
fundamental role of observation represents a major intellectual
<BR>
step forward over naive classical realism. The revolutionary new
<BR>
feature of quantum physics arises whenever there is no way,
<BR>
not even in principle, to tell which of various possibilities is the
<BR>
case. Then, instead of just having to acknowledge our ignorance,
<BR>
as we would have to in classical physics, quantum superposition
<BR>
comes in as a qualitatively new property. If the condition above
<BR>
should ever be realizable for the dead and live states of Schroedinger's
<BR>
cat (1), its quantum state has to be a superposition of these states.
<BR>
That clearly does not mean the cat is both alive and dead.
<BR>
It means only that no definite statement can be made concerning
<BR>
the question of whether the poor animal is alive or dead.
<BR>
Upon observation, we will find it in either state and thus the state
<BR>
assigned to the cat collapses into either possibility. It is not at all
<BR>
surprising that we have to change the representation of our knowledge
<BR>
if that knowledge changes because of information obtained by
<BR>
observation of the cat. The collapse of the state vector can be seen
<BR>
only as a ``measurement paradox'' if one views this change of the
<BR>
quantum state as a real physical process. In the extreme, it is often
<BR>
even claimed that something happens to the cat because it is being
<BR>
observed.
<BR>
- But Goldstein asks: Does Zeilinger truly believe that ``quantum mechanics
<BR>
is about information''? Information is always information about something.
<BR>
Therefore, shouldn't quantum mechanics then be regarded as being
<BR>
about that something? And does Zeilinger really wish to deny that the
<BR>
change of the state vector that occurs during the measurement process
<BR>
is ``a real physical process,'' even when it leads to the destruction of the
<BR>
possibility of interference? Can quantum interference be genuinely
<BR>
understood by invoking a wavefunction that is nothing more than
<BR>
``a representation of our knowledge''?
<BR>
<P>(1) Cat's paradox, in Schroedinger's terms:
<BR>
&quot;One can even set up quite ridiculous cases.
<BR>
A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with
<BR>
&nbsp;the following device (which must be secured against direct
<BR>
interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit
<BR>
of radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course
<BR>
of the hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability,
<BR>
&nbsp;perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through
<BR>
a relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic
<BR>
acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would
<BR>
say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. 
<BR>
The psi-function of the entire system would express this by having
<BR>
in it the living and dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared 
<BR>
out in equal parts. It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy 
<BR>
originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into 
<BR>
macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct 
<BR>
observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a 
<BR>
&quot;blurred model&quot; for representing reality. In itself it would not embody 
<BR>
anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between 
<BR>
a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds 
<BR>
and fog banks.&quot;
