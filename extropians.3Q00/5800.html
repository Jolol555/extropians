<EM> &gt;

<EM> &gt; You sure as hell do if you are going to replay all of evolution from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; bacteria to human beings as was initially implied.
</EM><BR>
<P>You don't have to start with bacteria, you could start with spiking
<BR>
networks of automata. 
<BR>
<P>But you need a really really large computer (say, a cubic foot of
<BR>
computronium, or all nodes on the global Net in a 15-20 years) to
<BR>
figure out an efficient way to even mutate the substrate. Afterwards,
<BR>
the evaluation of fitness function will take progressively larger
<BR>
resources, the smarter the critters become. Picking up a ball thrown
<BR>
to it can be evaluated in under a second of subjective time,
<BR>
evaluation of higher-order task performance could take hours of
<BR>
subjective time.
<BR>
<P>Right now one would want to evaluate fitness using physical robots,
<BR>
because, even considering time necessary to build them, simulating a
<BR>
complex reality in realtime is not yet possible. But notice the
<BR>
virtual league in robot soccer.
