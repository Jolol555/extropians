</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Good link.  Another possibility, however, especially as bandwidth improves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and more stuff can be done live, is interactive music sessions, in which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make direct requests and bid or tip as needed to get the music you want.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;other thought provoking ideas snipped&gt;
<BR>
<P>I think some serious thought ought to be given to the honor system / 
<BR>
shareware paradigm by artists in general, and musicians in particular.  As a 
<BR>
for instance, I recently Napstered Macy Gray’s excellent album, and am 
<BR>
enjoying it so much that I’d be *happy* to pay for the album (albeit at a 
<BR>
steep discount, since I neither have nor want the CD medium or the fancy 
<BR>
packaging).  I even searched the web looking for a place to purchase the MP3 
<BR>
version of the album.  (Not surprisingly, no such luck.)
<BR>
<P>I can hear the artists on the list saying “If you enjoy the album so much, 
<BR>
why don’t you just pop for the friggin’ CD?!?”  Good question.  Here’s the 
<BR>
answer:
<BR>
<P>I am thoroughly enjoying the album *today*.  I expect within a couple of 
<BR>
months I’ll tire of it.  As of now I own approximately 300 CD’s, of which I 
<BR>
still listen to about 10%.  The other 270 CD’s, after costing me over 
<BR>
$3,000.00, offer me little benefit other than taking up space and collecting 
<BR>
dust in my house.  I would much rather have purchased those albums in MP3 
<BR>
format (again at a steep discount) and done without the CD medium and fancy 
<BR>
packaging.  Then I’d be free to delete the album (or most of it, only 
<BR>
retaining those few songs on each album that I really like) freeing up space 
<BR>
for the new album by the next artist of the minute.
<BR>
<P>But nooooooo....., *that* would eat up too much of the recording industry’s 
<BR>
real cash cow business (manufacturing, packaging and distribution - none of 
<BR>
which I have any need for).  So my only options are (1) buy the friggin’ CD 
<BR>
and pay for all the superfluous “value added” hokum that I’d rather do 
<BR>
without, or (2) Napster the album and be branded a scofflaw.  I chose option 
<BR>
(1) for the past 20 years.  Frankly my dear, I’m sick of it.  Until there’s 
<BR>
a viable option (3), I’m sticking with Napster.
<BR>
