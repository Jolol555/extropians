<P><EM>&gt; Who ever said that free will = freedom from willfulness?
</EM><BR>
<P>Beats me. What I wrote is that you can't have willfulness and freedom from
<BR>
willfulness simultaneously. To be completely free means to be free from
<BR>
willfulness as well as it means to be free from anything else. So, as you imply,
<BR>
&quot;free will&quot; does *not* equal freedom from willfulness.
<BR>
Rather, &quot;Free will&quot; = a self contradiction.
<BR>
This is because &quot;free&quot; means unattached, not controlled or influenced by another
<BR>
force or interest. Will requires deliberate choice and is therefore not free of
<BR>
deliberation nor of choice.
<BR>
Will is bound to that which drives it.
<BR>
Therefore, will cannot be free.

world from attack by governments.&quot;  --Anonymous
