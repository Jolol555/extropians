Zero Powers asks,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What makes you think we'll be able to terminate a being which is orders of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; magnitude more intelligent than we are?  And even if we could, what makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you think AI will be bribable?  Why should it *care* whether it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terminated?  Particularly when its existence consists mostly of slave labor?
</EM><BR>
<P>First of all, AI does not equal SI. The question of the thread is &quot;Why would AI
<BR>
want to be friendly?&quot; not &quot;Why would SI want to be friendly?&quot;
<BR>
<P>AI will grow in intelligence just as any entity (including a human) does. As
<BR>
machines (our Mind Children) become more and more intelligent, those that
<BR>
display unfriendly characteristics (unlike human children) can be terminated by
<BR>
deletion. User friendliness is one of the most valuable assets of any program or
<BR>
operating system. The most user friendly programs will sell better than the
<BR>
others. If we can't figure out how to make machine intelligence friendly, then
<BR>
we'll enlist the help of genetic programming to solve this problem for us. As I
<BR>
see it, AI will be the friendliest of all human inventions, except for machine
<BR>
intelligence that AI invents.
<BR>

<BR>
of thinking we were at when we created them.&quot;  -Albert Einstein
