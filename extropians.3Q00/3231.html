Just
<BR>
<EM>&gt;think, as these implants get more sophisticated, they will be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;control every mood and thought we have. Besides giving us the medication
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we need for any medical problems, the Omni-Net(TM) will detect when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get depressed and signal our implants to release anti-depressants into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our bloodstream.  If the Omni-Net(TM) detects that we're getting angry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(which could definitely be a menace to society), it will release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sedatives into our bloodstream.  No more blow-ups, no more Columbines,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no more LA riots.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Just think, no more angry people in the world!  Everyone will be just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like Barney, happy happy, joy joy!  The world will become one big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;playground where everyone is hormonally regulated to remain in a normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and serene state.  We'll all be happy.  The societal benefits and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economic incentives  will be huge.  No more crime, no more hostility,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people buying consumer goods dictated to them by the companies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves, as consumers increasingly get all the techno-goodies it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wanted at a discount!  Meanwhile the companies that make them will see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their revenues go through the roof!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...........&gt;Paul Hughes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;P.S.  This is the extropian list right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Yes, but some of us will happier than others....  For example, let's say 
<BR>
that I'm one of the elite philosopher kings in this BNW (Brave New World), 
<BR>
or just one of the police.  Clearly, I should have the ability to take 
<BR>
CONTROL when things aren't going exactly the way I think is best, right?  
<BR>
Like today, as I was lashing stuff on my motorcycle, and I see these two 
<BR>
sweet young things (total strangers) approaching on the sidewalk.  So, 
<BR>
despite my best efforts as they appoach - moving stuff out of the way, etc. 
<BR>
to be polite, they get to within fifteen feet and then cross the street, 
<BR>
requiring them to fight thru heavy shrubbery -just to not get any closer to 
<BR>
me.  In broad daylight in a very safe area with continuous traffic....
<BR>
But in our BNW, if I had the proper system access - &quot;legal&quot; or not - then I 
<BR>
could just adjust a few little dollips of their hormones here and there as 
<BR>
they approached, and my evening might be very different indeed.
