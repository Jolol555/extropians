<P>LOS NINOS MAY BE GONE, BUT PESKY PACIFIC PATTERN REMAINS
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three years of El Nino and La Nina with their often devastating 
<BR>
climate consequences, the Pacific is finally calming down in the tropics 
<BR>
but still shows signs of being abnormal elsewhere, according to the latest 
<BR>
satellite data from the U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These data, taken during a 10-day cycle of collection ending August 17,
<BR>
<P>show that tropical Pacific sea levels, which indicate how much heat is 
<BR>
stored in the ocean, have returned to near-normal (green) after three years 
<BR>
of dramatic fluctuations. See <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/elnino/">http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/elnino/</A> .
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as summer ends in the Northern Hemisphere, remnants of the past few
<BR>
<P>years remain embedded in the upper ocean.  Above-normal sea surface heights 
<BR>
and warmer ocean temperatures (indicated by the red and white areas) still 
<BR>
blanket the far-western tropical Pacific and much of the north (and south) 
<BR>
mid-Pacific.  Red areas are about 10 centimeters (4 inches) above normal; 
<BR>
white areas show the sea surface height is between 14 and 32 centimeters (6 
<BR>
to 13 inches) above normal.  This contrasts with the Bering Sea and Gulf of 
<BR>
Alaska where lower-than-normal sea levels and cool ocean temperatures 
<BR>
continue (indicated by blue areas), although this pattern is also 
<BR>
weakening. The blue areas are between 5 and 13 centimeters (2 and 5 inches) 
<BR>
below normal, whereas the purple areas range from 14 to18 centimeters (6 to 
<BR>
7 inches) below normal.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the entire Pacific basin, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation's 
<BR>
(PDO) characteristic warm horseshoe and cool wedge pattern is still evident 
<BR>
in this sea-level height image. The PDO is a long-term ocean temperature 
<BR>
fluctuation of the Pacific Ocean that waxes and wanes approximately every 
<BR>
10 to 20 years. Most recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
<BR>
(NOAA) sea-surface temperature date also clearly illustrate the persistence 
<BR>
of this basin-wide pattern. They are available at:

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The present calming started three to four months ago when the La 
<BR>
Nina faded away,&quot; said oceanographer Dr. William Patzert of NASA's Jet 
<BR>
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  &quot;It appears that the global 
<BR>
climate system is finally recovering from the past three years of dramatic 
<BR>
swings from the extra-large El Nino of 1997/1998, which was followed by two 
<BR>
unusually cool and persistent La Nina years.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The good news is that we're finally out from under the El Nino and La
<BR>
Nina 
<BR>
of the past three years,&quot; Patzert said. &quot;Unfortunately, in the longer term, 
<BR>
the reality is that the PDO pattern still dominates the Pacific and, in the 
<BR>
short term, the atmosphere is still acting as though La Nina remains. The 
<BR>
western United States continues hot and dry, and a larger than normal 
<BR>
number of hurricanes are forecast by NOAA for both the Pacific and the 
<BR>
Atlantic. Also for the remainder of the summer and into the fall, we are 
<BR>
continuing to experience the legacy or hangover from El Nino and La Nina -- 
<BR>
the devastating Western U.S. fires from the Canadian to Mexican borders are 
<BR>
one example.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National
<BR>
Weather 
<BR>
Service has forecasted continuing heat in the Western United States and an 
<BR>
active hurricane season for the end of summer and into the fall. NOAA 
<BR>
seasonal forecasts can be found at: <A HREF="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov">http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov</A> and 
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month marks the eighth anniversary of the launch of
<BR>
TOPEX/Poseidon, a 
<BR>
mission that had been planned to last only three to five years. The 
<BR>
satellite has orbited Earth more than 37,400 times and completed 290 10-day 
<BR>
data collection cycles. More than 99 percent of all available mission data 
<BR>
has been collected and archived by the operations team at JPL.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S.-French TOPEX/Poseidon mission is managed by JPL for NASA's
<BR>
Earth 
<BR>
Science Enterprise, Washington, D.C.  JPL is a division of the California 
<BR>
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
