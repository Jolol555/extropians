<EM>&gt;&gt;Friedrich W. Nietzsche died in august 1900, the 25th.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To me, the essence of Nietzsche is that he was a destroyer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the boxes within which people are intelligent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In his attempt to destroy religious boxes, he said &quot;God is dead!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and got his message onto the cover of Time magazine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Many religious people are highly intelligent... within their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;religious boxes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Max Stirner ('The Ego and its Own') was, in my opinion, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more penetrating box-destroyer than Nietzsche. He essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said, &quot;You need to go beyond killing God, you need to destroy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the very notion of &quot;god&quot; (so-called), the very idea of &quot;god&quot;; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;word &quot;god&quot; needs to become no more than a nonsense-noise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to you.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>If Stirner  had heard the phrases, &quot;intelligence in a box&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;box-destroyer,&quot; he may well have liked them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;From 'The Ego and Its Own':
<BR>
&quot;Just as the schoolmen philosophized only *inside* the belief
<BR>
of the church; as Pope Benedict XIV wrote fat books *inside* the papist 
<BR>
superstition, without ever
<BR>
throwing a doubt upon this belief; as authors fill whole folios on the 
<BR>
State without calling in question the
<BR>
fixed idea of the State itself; as our newspapers are crammed with politics 
<BR>
because they are conjured into
<BR>
the fancy that man was created to be a zoon politicon -- so also subjects 
<BR>
vegetate in subjection, virtuous
<BR>
people in virtue, liberals in humanity, without ever putting to these fixed 
<BR>
ideas of theirs the searching knife
<BR>
of criticism. Undislodgeable, like a madman's delusion, those thoughts 
<BR>
stand on a firm footing, and he
<BR>
who doubts them -- lays hands on the sacred! Yes, the &quot;fixed idea,&quot; that is 
<BR>
the truly sacred!&quot; [Stirner's emphasis]
<BR>

<BR>
<P>BTW, I agree that Stirner was a more penetrating &quot;box-destoyer&quot; than Nietzsche.
