<P>&lt;&lt; Sigh. This is simply inaccurate. Leading scholars know that the world will
<BR>
&nbsp;be destroyed when the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy fight to the death
<BR>
&nbsp;on top of Sugar Mountain, with the victor killed by Santa Claus. Luckily
<BR>
&nbsp;they will all be reincarnated when their thetans are retrieved from the
<BR>
&nbsp;pumping stations. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
&quot;Oh to live on Sugar Mountain, with the Barkers and the Colored Balloons.. 
<BR>
(hmm balloons again!)&quot;  In my book, its Santa that gets whacked by the Lucky 
<BR>
Charms Leprechaun. Actually, this reminds me of the stop-motion send-up of 
<BR>
the archaic stop-mo' by Rankin/Bass &quot;Rudloph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; (1965). 
<BR>
This appeared as a short for MAD-TV and had the same characters portrayed as 
<BR>
NYC mobsters (allegedly directed by Martin Scorcese') and staring Robert Di 
<BR>
Nero; kind of a Mean Streets plus the Godfather doing Christmas at the North 
<BR>
Pole.
