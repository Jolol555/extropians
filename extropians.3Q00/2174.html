Dear friends,
<BR>
<P>Many of were devastated by the loss of our beloved friend Sasha
<BR>
Chislenko this past May.  I had heard a rumor of a fund being set up in
<BR>
his name, to help with college tuition for his son Eugene.  I recently
<BR>
contacted Sasha's wife Julia, who said she is not aware of such a fund.
<BR>
Julia has not sought help with Eugene's tuition, but said she would
<BR>
welcome any contributions that anyone cares to make.
<BR>
<P>Eugene is going to Harvard in the fall.  As anyone who has met him can
<BR>
tell you, he is an phenomenally  bright and talented young man who is
<BR>
sure to achieve great things.  As anyone who has a child in Harvard can
<BR>
also tell you, tuition there is very expensive -- currently between $30K
<BR>
and $35K per year, I understand.  Losing your father at age 16 is
<BR>
terrible enough.  Having to struggle to get through college is not
<BR>
something Eugene and his family need at this point.
<BR>
<P>I therefore propose to set up a  memorial fund in Sasha's name, with the
<BR>
specific purpose of helping Eugene with college expenses.  If Extropy
<BR>
Institute is able to administer the fun through its (ExI's) non-profit
<BR>
status, that is fine; otherwise, I will do whatever paperwork is
<BR>
necessary to get the fund set up, and will administer it myself.
<BR>
<P>Please let me know, via the Extropians List or by private e-mail to
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:levy@cs.brandeis.edu?Subject=Re:%20Sasha%20Chislenkno%20Memorial%20Fund&In-Reply-To=&lt;398339C5.9C3F89F0@mail.cs.brandeis.edu&gt;">levy@cs.brandeis.edu</A>, if you can contribute to this fund, or know
<BR>
anything about how to set such things up.  I would like to have this in
<BR>
place by the time Eugene starts at Harvard in the fall.
<BR>
<P>Thank you,
<BR>
Simon Levy
