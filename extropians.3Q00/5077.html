</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nearly as many books now as I did in my misspent youth.  Now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in my misspent adulthood, the internet has taken the place of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; lot of that, not just the lists, but web surfing, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Small%20libraries%20(was%20Transparency%20and%20IP)&In-Reply-To=&lt;39C2FEC6.6384913C@ibm.net&gt;">hal@finney.org</A> finds] this to be true as well.  Surfing the net and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading mailing lists is relaxing and entertaining, mental fast-food
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared to the nourishing meal of a good book.  Maybe we need to go on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an intellectual &quot;diet&quot; occasionally, get some good nutrition.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have toyed with this notion, but I keep deciding that written
<BR>
material is not necessarily more profound or more relevant just
<BR>
because it managed to get printed on dead trees.  In fact, often
<BR>
just the opposite is true.  The dead trees thing has the advantage
<BR>
of being highly edited, where the lists are not.  On the other hand,
<BR>
the list stuff is highly focussed and up to date.  Furthermore, it
<BR>
responds to exactly what one asks.  Sometimes.  A book is strictly
<BR>
one-way communication, and you are on the receiving end.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, I point no fingers, for I am a hopeless internet junky,
<BR>
with 6 other lists besides this one, plus several websites that I
<BR>
monitor every day.  This obsession even crowds out the TV,
<BR>
but I can give it up any time I want.  If I want.  Badly enough.
<BR>
<P>To prove it, and to devour an ever growing stack of books, I will
<BR>
not touch my email, not even log on, for twoooo fuuulll weeeeeks.
<BR>
See ya.  {8-]  spike
