<P><EM>&gt; Actually, anyone who has a 3 year old child (or 4 year old nephew as I do),
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; rather easily recall that former self. I remember quite a bit from those days.
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; got my first model plane at that age, a rechargable electric piper, I remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things like my dad driving me around the Raytheon plant, sitting in the back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seat of the car and asking my parents for a little brother. Plenty of
</EM><BR>
memories,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; impressions, etc. I remember my impressions of other people that I still know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now (its funny how people you once thought of as god-like individuals become
</EM><BR>
far
<BR>
<EM>&gt; more human as you grow up.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like you had a golden childhood. Perhaps people who &quot;can't&quot; remember
<BR>
their early childhood really *don't want* to remember it.

<P><P><P><P>&quot;The most dangerous man, to any government, is the man who is able to
<BR>
think things out for himself, without regard to the prevailing
<BR>
superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion
<BR>
that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane and intolerable,
<BR>
and so, if he is romantic, he tries to change it. And even if he is not
<BR>
romantic personally he is very apt to spread discontent among those who
<BR>
are.&quot;
