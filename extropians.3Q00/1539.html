<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;profile of Japanese centenarians--high prevalence of hypo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;beta lipoproteinemia]. [Japanese]

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To study the relationship between lipids and longevity, we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;examined the level of serum lipids and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;apolipoproteins, and the susceptibility of low density
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation of 45 centenarians (15 men,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;30 women, mean age 101.1 +/- 1.4) living in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;average levels of total cholesterol (TC), of LDL-C of high-density
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;apolipoproteins A1 and B were significantly lower in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;centenarians than in healthy middle-aged controls. The frequency of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hypobeta-lipoproteinemia (apoB &lt; 60 mg/dl) in centenarians
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;was almost ten times as high as in controls. The time course of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;copper-mediated LDL, oxidation (assessed by monitoring 234 nm diene
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;absorption (lag time)) did not significantly differ between the two groups.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of LDL subfractions by non-denaturated gradient-gel electrophoresis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;showed a predominance of large, buoyant LDL particles (pattern A) in 75%, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a predominance of small dense LDL particles (pattern B) in 25% of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;centenarians. We also assessed activities of daily living (ADL) and cognitive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;function in the centenarians. Centenarians were divided into two groups
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the median ADL score, and were classified into five groups with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a scale clinical dementia. In subjects with good ADL scores, the mean
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;concentration of HDL-3-C was significantly higher than in those with poor ADL
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scores. Average levels of HDL-C were also significantly lower in subjects
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with moderate or severe dementia than in those with normal cognitive
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;function. These findings suggest that centenarians have protective phenotypes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of lipids and lipoproteins that protect
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;them from atheroscierosis.
