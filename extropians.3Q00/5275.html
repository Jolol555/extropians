<BR>
<EM>&gt; how have you raised your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kids?
</EM><BR>
<P>I always thought more in terms of watching my child unfold (sort of like
<BR>
a flower) rather than raising her.  It was great fun showing Earth to a
<BR>
new resident.   Up until  she got too heavy to carry in a backpack (it
<BR>
was a backpack made especially for carrying kids), I took her everywhere
<BR>
I went, even to concerts and films (I don't remember her ever crying or
<BR>
making any sort of disturbance) and since I had my own business she went
<BR>
to work with me as well. By that time she wanted to be down on the ground
<BR>
running around on her own, and it got to be more difficult to take her
<BR>
everywhere.  
<BR>
<P>When Kitty was very small I never left her alone for more than a few
<BR>
minutes (I didn't find that I needed any sort of general anesthetic
<BR>
during the birth process, so I was able to hold her and comfort her from
<BR>
the moment she was born)--she always slept in the bed with me and her
<BR>
father until she decided she was ready for her own bed.  Leaving small
<BR>
babies alone is not in keeping with human nature.  When I was a child the
<BR>
predominate belief was that a baby should be left alone to cry until it
<BR>
had no more energy for crying and fell asleep; this seems such a
<BR>
horrible, cruel way to treat a person, makes me shudder to think of it. 
<BR>
This child rearing practice alone could go far towards explaining the
<BR>
fact that antidepressants are some of the most commonly used drugs in our
<BR>
culture.
<BR>
<P>My attitude towards children has always been that they're normal people
<BR>
and are best treated as such.  I've found that they're much more
<BR>
intelligent than our culture gives them credit for being and are capable
<BR>
of making their own decisions.  I've also found them eager to be helpful
<BR>
if they're given the chance--this applies to all children, not just my
<BR>
own.
<BR>
<P>BTW Kat (which is what she calls herself now) has given me permission to
<BR>
write about her to this list.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How do you deal with biases of the school system? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I always left it up to Kat to decided whether she wanted to go to school
<BR>
or not.  Up until highschool, she sometimes went to school and sometimes
<BR>
stayed home.  For the days she chose to stay home,  we'd make up some
<BR>
excuse that would sound good to the school authorities (this brought up
<BR>
the opportunity to discuss the morality of lying--when it's morally ok to
<BR>
lie; when it's morally wrong to tell the truth, etc.)  I always told her
<BR>
not to take the school authorities too seriously but to conduct herself
<BR>
in such a way that she wouldn't disturb the other people.  The public
<BR>
schools in our small community are good, and parents were always
<BR>
encouraged to participate--it was ok with the teachers for a parent to
<BR>
wander into the classroom at any time without any sort of appointment.  I
<BR>
did volunteer work in my Kat's classes and thus got to know the teachers
<BR>
and the other kids.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately the State of Texas now has a law that a student must attend
<BR>
school a certain number of days in order to get credit for courses
<BR>
taken--even if they make perfect scores on the exams.  They only allow 3
<BR>
absences within any 9 week period.  I believe it's a misguided attempt to
<BR>
keep the kids off the streets and out of trouble.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Are they given 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; any sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of religious upbringing?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Neither I nor Kat's father are religious, so we never gave her any sort
<BR>
of religious instruction. I told her some of the myths from various
<BR>
religions but only as good stories, not as sacred truths.  She went to
<BR>
Christian churches with friends now and then.  I probably told her at the
<BR>
time to take what she heard at church with a grain of salt. She herself
<BR>
recognized the contradictions within those religions and questioned me
<BR>
about some of them.  She's investigated various other religions on her
<BR>
own--was attracted to Wicca for a short while but in the end decided it
<BR>
was interesting but silly.  The answers she gives to Christian
<BR>
prosyletizers have surprised me with their simutaneous depth and tact.
<BR>
<P>Do your kids know about libertarianism, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; cryonics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nano-technology, space colonization, SETI, the Singularity, etc.?  
</EM><BR>
<P>Only from hearing me mention them, I think.  So far she hasn't shown any
<BR>
great interest in any of these except for nano-technology,
<BR>
libertarianism, and the Singulariy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; share your interests?
</EM><BR>
<P>Kat isn't the least bit interested in gardening.  She's somewhat
<BR>
interested in the law and accounting/business (she's interested in making
<BR>
money).  She's always liked math (when she was a little girl I once
<BR>
overheard her telling a friend at school, &quot;My mom's good at math, and so
<BR>
am I.&quot;).  We both like swimming (I first took her swimming when she was
<BR>
around 6 weeks old and she's loved it ever since). She's more interested
<BR>
in the inner workings of computers and  computer programming than I am. 
<BR>
And so forth.  She's had very much her own personality ever since she was
<BR>
little.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you taken any particular steps to 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; inculcate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rationality in them?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, not other than by behaving rationally myself (which, alas, I don't
<BR>
always do, but I try).  I think rationality's an innate part of human
<BR>
nature, and it takes quite a bit of brainwashing and cruel treatment to
<BR>
destroy it. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And for everyone:  Do you try to pass the memes on to your friends 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; colleagues? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Only through my behavior or if someone tries to get me to participate in
<BR>
doing something I consider wrong (such as being cruel to kids), eg. by
<BR>
asking me to force children to sit in a school room pretending to pay
<BR>
attention to a teacher's drivel.  In such cases, I'll refuse to
<BR>
participate and tell them why I'm refusing.  I usually don't get into
<BR>
arguments with people about their religious or political beliefs, because
<BR>
I've found that it's futile.  Regarding future technologies, I don't make
<BR>
a special point of bringing them up, but sometimes conversation ends up
<BR>
going in those directions.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;How successful have you been? 
<BR>
<P>With respect to child-rearing I've been somewhat successful, because
<BR>
Kat's an unusually good kid, and people often ask me how I did it (I had
<BR>
a foster kid for a while as well, who did very well when he was with me
<BR>
and people asked what I'd done).  The simple answer is, &quot;I've done
<BR>
nothing.&quot;  But it's a rather profound answer when you think about it. 
<BR>
The natural human potential is to be rational, friendly, loving.  If kids
<BR>
are given the freedom to just unfold as their nature leads them to do,
<BR>
they'll turn out to be good people (barring brain abnormalities--however
<BR>
my opinion is that abnormalities such as chemical imbalances can be
<BR>
brought about through emotional and physical stress).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Who seems the most/least
<BR>
<EM>&gt; receptive?
</EM><BR>
<P>Smart people seem to be most receptive.  Highly religious people seem to
<BR>
be least receptive.
