<EM>&gt; &gt; One proposal turns art from a product into a service.  That is, you pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the artist for his time, not for each copy of the output.  An artist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would agree to release a new artwork only when enough people had pledged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to pay for it.  Once it was released, it would be freely available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; He might release a partial or low-quality version ahead of time to show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people what the final product would be like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's actually quite a cool idea. You might combine an idea of &quot;private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clubs&quot; with art produced this way. Kind of like patronage for the masses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Everyone who chips in gets to be a paid-up member, with all kinds of extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; priveleges with regard to merchandise, artist contact, and being legally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowed to call themselves whatever the &quot;club members&quot; are called (king
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doody chicken, or something like that) etc, which cannot be bought after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pledge amount is reached. People love to be members of elite (or not so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elite) clubs, this would work rather well.
</EM><BR>
<P>And, objections of Nadia aside, this is already done with painters and sculptors
<BR>
by art galleries on the web. Take the Linda Cannon Gallery in Seattle for
<BR>
instance (the first art gallery on the web). Every one of her artists have low
<BR>
quality images of their pieces on display on the website, with no control over
<BR>
their use. The originals, of course, cost several thousand dollars.
<BR>
<P>Painters also release limited, numbered runs of prints of their works which
<BR>
typically sell for less than a tenth of the price of the original, depending on
<BR>
the quantity made. This is actually where the real money is made by the artist,
<BR>
where a run of 200 numbered prints nets twenty times as much money as the value
<BR>
of the original work.
<BR>
<P>Writers also can make more money off of signed copies of their books.
<BR>
<P>Beyond that, you can go into more commercial work, as many artists have done
<BR>
(Vargas, Parrish, etc) to make a living while they worked on their more
<BR>
non-commercial work (as I do as a technical writer/graphic artist for a software
<BR>
company). An artist may not realize great success with their Art, but there is
<BR>
no reason they cannot realize a decent living off of it without too much extra
<BR>
effort.
