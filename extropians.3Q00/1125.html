<P><EM>     &gt; It seems far from clear to me that it is trivial to take a design for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; bridge, throw some nanodust at it and say &quot;Build it for me over there.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; Assembly  and construction use intelligence, just as design does.
</EM><BR>
<P>About 5 years ago I listed 6 reasons why a macroscopic assembler, like a
<BR>
person on a assembly line, was doing a far more difficult task that requires much
<BR>
more brain power than a Nanotechnology assembler ever would. I still think it's true,
<BR>
if it wasn't biology wouldn't exist.
<BR>
<P>1) The parts a macroscopic assembler uses would be very expensive, the parts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Nanotechnology uses, atoms, are very cheap.
<BR>
<P>2) A macroscopic assembler must use many thousands or millions of different
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;types of parts and it must learn how to use all of them. At the most,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanotechnology uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world almost everything we know of is made of only about 20 parts, and for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life about 10.
<BR>
<P>3) All the many different parts a macroscopic assembler must use are fragile,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fragile in different ways, the machine must learn the proper handling
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;techniques for them all or it will destroy the parts before it can use
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them. There is no way you can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with.
<BR>
<P>4) None of the parts in a macroscopic factory are absolutely identical.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite our best efforts, individual variation still exists, and so we
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must deal with each part slightly differently and  compensate for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variation in the assembly process if we want the finished product to work
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;properly, that often takes intelligence. On the  other hand, according to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the laws of Physics one hydrogen atom is absolutely identical to another
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hydrogen atom and can be treated in exactly the same way.  Atoms have no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scratches on them to tell them apart.
<BR>
<P>5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;domain. You may have to deal with a rod 27 carbon atoms long, or 28 atoms
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long, but you never have to worry about a rod 27.5601334 atoms long.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Macro assembler wouldn't have that luxury when it tried to build
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something with an oak log.
<BR>
<P>6) Most of the parts a macroscopic  assembler use would have to be very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complex and the ways they interact with other macroscopic parts would be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even more complex. Think of the windshield of a car, it interacts poorly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the engine block, and even with the windshield frame the interaction
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be managed with great skill or you'll have a disaster. Nanotechnology
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like building with Lego blocks, you can build structures of arbitrary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complexity, yet there are only a few different types of blocks and they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interact with other blocks (bounds) in only a few different ways.
<BR>
