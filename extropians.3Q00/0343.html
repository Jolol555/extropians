I could buy that. But, I've also had lengthy conversations with people
<BR>
who comprehend the inner workings of the Universe much better than I,
<BR>
hence my ignorance far surpasses theirs. And still I hear them utter
<BR>
spiritual descriptors to report their understanding.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately, this is probably a semantic issue. One uses the word
<BR>
&quot;spiritual&quot; in this current time to refer to feelings of awe, child-like
<BR>
wonder, and a vast reverence (if you will) for how the Universe is
<BR>
constructed. It is not necessarily used to denote some connection with a
<BR>
higher power, but rather a euphemism for conveying the proper &quot;poetry&quot;
<BR>
associated with belief in the Divine and its constructs. 
<BR>
<P>Personally, I prefer terms such as 'appreciation', 'wonder', 'awe', or
<BR>
'bewilderment'. To me, the words 'spiritual' or 'spirituality' are
<BR>
over-burdened with religious connotations, and should be used with the
<BR>
utmost caution.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I feel that, at least for my friends and colleagues, there is a
<BR>
strong undertone of continuing on the path of learning. They may be
<BR>
expressing that it is the state of mystery that causes them 'spiritual'
<BR>
feelings, but I also believe that present within their exclamations is
<BR>
the drive for complete understanding. So, again, this may be a poor
<BR>
choice of words on their part, or it may simply be that I lack the
<BR>
poet's mouth to render my empirical eyes comprehensible to the lay.

<EM>&gt; Do you think such people actually mean that they appreciate not only the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beauty or whatever, but the mystery (for them) of how it got that way?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words, most of these &quot;spiritual&quot; people are simply looking for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a nice way of saying that they enjoy being ignorant?

<EM>&gt; &gt; What is the difference between being &quot;spiritually&quot; inclined and just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; having a grand appreciation for your life and the reality you currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inhabit? Many people I've talked to often claim a sense of spirituality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without belief in some higher Creator/Supreme Being. Upon probing, what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've found is simply that they appreciate the complexity and the beauty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of their environment (internal and external) without reference to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all-powerful deity. So, my question would then be, why use the loaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; term spiritual, when really, you mean simple appreciation for your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; circumstances (whatever you perceive/believe them to be)?
