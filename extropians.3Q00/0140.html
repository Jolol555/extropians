<EM>&gt;&gt; If the perfect human is tall (&quot;because he gets the girls&quot;), you will

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; have half-mile high humans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps if &quot;taller&quot; always and unequivocally equalled &quot;better.&quot;
</EM><BR>
It is not &quot;better&quot; but good on some non-substitutable quality.
<BR>
<P>To take the tree example, trees have all sorts of problems cause dby being
<BR>
tall, indeed, they are so tall that they push the physically defined limits
<BR>
of hydrostatic pressures involved in pumping water to these great heights.
<BR>
But ... Despite not being &quot;unequivovally better&quot; we have all these tall
<BR>
tress. Why? Because if you are the shortest tree in the forest, you are
<BR>
fucked. Forget that you are much more efficient, and can produce more seeds
<BR>
by not haing to produce wood for humans and beavers to confiscate, you are
<BR>
simply suffocated by your tall cousins and die.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Life is trade offs. We cannot, logically, all be tall. Therefore, we cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; be &quot;perfect&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps relatively speaking we can't all be tall, but we could all avoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being short which, I believe, is the point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Like retarded people avoid being retarded by being differently able?
