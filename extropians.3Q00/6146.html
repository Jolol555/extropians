<P><EM>&gt; I think codes directly mutating machine instructions (including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtual machine instructions) using evolutionary algorithms should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered dangerous, and hence regulated.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>WHAT!?  Common optimization techniques mutate machine instructions. 
<BR>
Many types of system write and execute code dynamically.  A code
<BR>
improvment tool might be consider some kind of dangerous thing by this
<BR>
stricture.  How do you delimit this?  And do you really want to?  So
<BR>
much more than simple code rewriting is necessary to get anywhere near a
<BR>
dangerous level of AI.  
<BR>
<P>I have in mind as a someday RSN project something that takes source code
<BR>
and applies series of refactoring rules and design patterns and such to
<BR>
it in an evolutionary manner to produce code that is &quot;better&quot; along a
<BR>
set of interesting dimensions.  Under your scenario, this would severely
<BR>
regulated.  Have I got that right?  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Data carrier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic must be one-way: from the outside to the inside only. This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means the cluster you do research with must be located in a physically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; secure permanently offline facility. Decomissioned components must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; destroyed onsite (e.g. hard drives and flash memories using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thermite). Etc. etc. etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Way too heavy for all but the most intense and germane to major AI types
<BR>
of research.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Notice that above is not designed to contain AI, just to contain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; infectious code you generate during AI research. You definitely do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want that roaming the networks of near future without artificial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immune systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, we have things like agents roaming the web right now and some
<BR>
tasks are not very tractable without them.  Some of them can even fire
<BR>
off new agents.  Would that be covered in your rules?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Research into engineered biological pathogens and free-environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (this includes space) capable molecular autoreplicators should also be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similiarly regulated. I would personally think best locations for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these would way be outside of Earth's gravity well, in a really really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good containment. Something which you could rapidly deorbit into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sun would seem a good place. (A nuke would be probably not safe).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Regulated by whom?  By your average politicos?  This is worse than the
<BR>
danger.  You would think that at least off planet research would not be
<BR>
so strict.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether it will be any good is open to question, but at least you'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be plugging some holes and buying precious time. Reducing the amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of potential nucleation sites reduces the probability of nucleation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; event over a given period of time, as long as it doesn't bring people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on stupid ideas. (Many teenagers would be thrilled to do classified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research from their bedrooms).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually many quite mature programmers (myself included) are not at all
<BR>
keen to have code rewriting software locked down.  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If I knew someone is about to succeed in building a &gt;H AI or a gray
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goo autoreplicator before we're ready for it, despite an universal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moratorium I would nuke him without a second thought.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I thought you understood that moratoriums do not work.
