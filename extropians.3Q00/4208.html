</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some would say we don't currently have a true free-market,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I agree.  But I see no evidence to suggest that a true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free-market would be any better for human freedom and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;justice than what we have now.  At least now, we have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pretense of a Constitution to protect the liberties of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals over tyranny.  What are free-market advocates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alternatives?  Are you suggesting a universal social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contract to safeguard freedom and justice in a free-market?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Wouldn't that be the re-creation of  governmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;intervention all over again?  If so, then you are no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;left with a free-market again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
No one is forced to sign on to my proposed social contract.  In fact, there 
<BR>
could easilly be competition.  However, it would be in everyone's interest 
<BR>
to find ways to adjudicate disputes between parties that signed on to 
<BR>
differing contracts.  This should result in working Meta-contracts, which, 
<BR>
in effect, reduce once again to a universal social contract.
<BR>
Some people would doubtless choose to remain totally separate.  Fine.  They 
<BR>
would simply have to pay the risk costs up front that were reduced by being 
<BR>
a signatory.  I.e., they might have to post bonds, buy insurance, etc. at 
<BR>
somewhat higher rates than signatories would be charged.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I challenge anyone on this list to demonstrate how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free-markets can exist without a feudalist tyranny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resulting.  Demonstrate how such a system  will not favor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the rich over poor when it comes to basic civil rights and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;justice.  If you can't, then you should stop complaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when people call you fascists or at best platocracists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sure companies are there to meet the demands of the consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and stockholders, but that just goes to show you that he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the most money - rich consumer, rich stockholder makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all the rules.  Who is there to protect the little guy?  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you don't give a damn about the little guy, then I rest my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case.
</EM><BR>

Why should those of us who label ourselves &quot;anarchists&quot; have to prove 
<BR>
anything?  Just look at the record of the state!  All the private crimes 
<BR>
throughout history don't even come close to the destruction caused by a 
<BR>
single major war.
<BR>
<P>I suggest you take a look at the Mondragon Cooperative, the largest business 
<BR>
in Spain, coming straight out of the anarcho-syndicalist tradition.  Or look 
<BR>
at Somalia, which did fairly well for itself for about a decade, even 
<BR>
defeating the remaining SuperPower in military combat, without any 
<BR>
government at all.  They managed to keep the water running, the phones 
<BR>
working, the electric power going, without ANY government.  And they didn't 
<BR>
even have an alternative plan as to how to organize things.  It just 
<BR>
happened.  Think how much better they could have done with some key business 
<BR>
technology to handle dispute resolutions...
