<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Otherwise it is not easy to normalize, that is to compute the entropy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; involved in a quantum measurement.
</EM><BR>
<P>David Blenkinsop :
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Try looking up the the &quot;complete&quot; version of what entropy is all about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in Chapter 4 of _Nanosystems_,
</EM><BR>
<P>I suggest that Drexler might want expand his definition of entropy a
<BR>
little bit.
<BR>
<P>In 1998, I heard a talk by Ariel Caticha [1] describing a different
<BR>
way to treat state vectors. He calls the idea &quot;array entropy&quot;, which
<BR>
was originally introduced by Edwin Jaynes [2], but Jaynes thought
<BR>
that it was inadequate for the entropy of a quantum system. Caticha,
<BR>
however, expanded on Jaynes' idea in a nice way. He assigned
<BR>
amplitudes and wave functions, not just to the system, but to *the
<BR>
whole experimental setup*.
<BR>
<P>[In the following, I synthesize a bit from Caticha's article.
<BR>
For the full article, get the conference proceedings [1] or look at
<BR>
the xxx server, where he he has two slightly earlier articles available:

&quot;Consistency, Amplitudes and Probabilities in Quantum Theory&quot;]
<BR>
<P>One of the objectives of quantum theory is to predict the outcomes
<BR>
of experiments. Amplitudes are used to predict the outcomes of
<BR>
experiments, where, mathematically, the amplitudes are calculated
<BR>
via &quot;Hilbert norms&quot; (These norms, or inner products, are the means
<BR>
to measure the distance between wave functions). Interpreting the
<BR>
amplitudes can then be used to prove the &quot;Born postulate&quot; provided
<BR>
that amplitudes are assigned to the experimental setup. Caticha
<BR>
calls this extra assignment  a &quot;constraint&quot; that the amplitudes be
<BR>
assigned consistently.
<BR>
<P>NOTE: Caticha says in his appendix that Born's postulate is a
<BR>
theorem that has been independently discovered several times: A.M.
<BR>
Gleason, J. Rat. Mech. Anal. 6, 885 (1957); D. Finkelstein, Trans.
<BR>
NY Acad. Sci. 25, 621 (1963); J.B. Hartle, Am. J. Phys. 36, 704
<BR>
(1968); N. Graham, in &quot;The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum
<BR>
Mechanics&quot; ed. by B.S. DeWitt and N. Graham (Princeton, 1973). The
<BR>
limit N-&gt;infinity where N is the number of replicas of the system is
<BR>
further discussed in E. Farhi, J. Goldstone, and S. Gutman, Ann.
<BR>
Phys. 192, 368 (1989).
<BR>
<P>His approach, to consistently assign amplitudes to the experimental
<BR>
setup, is to assign a single complex number to each setup in a way
<BR>
that relations among the experimental parts translate into relations
<BR>
among the corresponding complex numbers. The consistency comes in by
<BR>
the requirement that if there are two different ways to compute this
<BR>
complex number, then the two answers must agree.
<BR>
<P>Caticha uses a path integral approach [3] to cover all possible
<BR>
combinations of starting points and interactions prior to the
<BR>
observing time. These lead to the same numerical value for the
<BR>
amplitude, that is, the outcome of the experiment. These amplitudes
<BR>
can then be inserted in the quantum mechanical equation of motion-
<BR>
the Schroedinger equation.
<BR>
<P>How to get from the Schroedinger equation to the Born postulate? The
<BR>
Born postulate states that the probability of N independent
<BR>
particles is the product of the wavefunction (amplitude-squared) for
<BR>
each of the particles, and the sum of each those is unity. [Note:
<BR>
here is the connection to the Many Worlds Interpretation.] The
<BR>
Schroedinger equation is an equation of motion. Caticha shows that
<BR>
the connection can be made by using a Hilbert norm.
<BR>
<P>After Caticha shows the connection, he wants to evolve the system in
<BR>
time, and he does that with an entropy array. Once he applies the
<BR>
entropy array, then he can measure any observable in the system, and
<BR>
he says that the time evolution of states is &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;unitary&quot;.
<BR>
(I'm still pondering the significance of those last two things)
<BR>
<P>EXTRA NOTE: Yes, this is a kind of Bayesian approach. If one adopts
<BR>
a Bayesian approach to probability, then the Schroedinger wave
<BR>
equation simply becomes a posterior probability describing
<BR>
our incomplete information about the quantum system,
<BR>
rather than wave functions that collapse in reality upon our
<BR>
observation. It could clear up a lot of confusion. I posted
<BR>
something to the extropians list about Bayesian approaches last
<BR>
year, and you can find that message here:
