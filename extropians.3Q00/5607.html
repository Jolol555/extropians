<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;F135UHQHh2wLCVYl4ma0000255d@hotmail.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;Oh, why bother.  I really am starting to get a bit frustrated over here.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been talking about this for weeks and it doesn't seem to have any effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatsoever.  Nobody is even bothering to distinguish between subgoals and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supergoals.  You're all just playing with words.
</EM><BR>
<P>To a large extent you are right.  You are talking about computer programming 
<BR>
strategies.  I, and I believe others in this thread, are really talking 
<BR>
about philosophy.  Perhaps that is because you have in mind the seed AI you 
<BR>
are working on, and I have in mind a more fully developed super-intelligent, 
<BR>
sentient AI.
<BR>
<P>The programming strategies you are focusing on are relevant to *developing* 
<BR>
the *seed*.  However, once the AI becomes super-intelligent and sentient, 
<BR>
talking about it in terms of your supergoal-subgoal programming terms will 
<BR>
be just as convenient as trying to describe your own behaviors in that way.  
<BR>
At some point in the AI's development you will have to make the jump to the 
<BR>
level of philosophy in order to discuss its goals in a meaningful way.  That 
<BR>
is what I am trying to discuss here.  If that is frustrating to you then, 
<BR>
yes, perhaps you ought to sit this thread out.
<BR>
