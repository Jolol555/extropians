<EM>&gt; highly skeptical since in the past every claim of a successful test, without

<EM>&gt; exception, has turned out to be rigged.
</EM><BR>
<P>Beg to differ.  The news media loves to *claim* the successful tests
<BR>
were rigged, but in fact such claims reveal a failure to understand the
<BR>
nature of tests.  One famous example is the ERIS test, in which the
<BR>
target contained a homing beacon.  That test was a test of the concept
<BR>
of end game guidance using cruciform nozzles.  It hit the target, so
<BR>
the intercept attempt was a success.  ERIS was a proof-of-concept
<BR>
that later led to the THAAD system.  The customer was fully aware
<BR>
of the configuration of the target, and cheerfully paid to have it run.
<BR>
<P>That test was not a test of target discrimination, for that technology
<BR>
was not ready at that time.  There were no decoys to discriminate.
<BR>
That test was not a test of multispectrum seekers, for that technology
<BR>
was not ready then.  The ERIS did not even *contain* a seeker,
<BR>
it was a test of end-game guidance only.  No conspiracy.  Those
<BR>
technologies *are* ready now, and will be tested now, and in
<BR>
the coming years.
<BR>
<P>The news media, stinging under the notion that Ronald Reagan's star-
<BR>
wars fantasy could have basis in actual fact (after they had repeatedly
<BR>
and vehemently ridiculed the idea), cooked up a story, which
<BR>
most of the gullible public bought, that the target team had cheated
<BR>
and helped the missile team.  These same news media continue to
<BR>
cook up one-sided stories to this day on the same subject and
<BR>
the results are similar now to what they were 20 yrs ago.  Over the
<BR>
years, the news media have flushed an enoooormous amount of
<BR>
credibility capital, insisting that national missile defense is hopeless,
<BR>
now and forever.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not one test has been realistic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Was the Wright brother's flight at Kitty Hawk a realistic test?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Missile defense is economics, so if they were smart they'd conduct a study
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to see if there is any way their proposed defensive system can be made cheaper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than an enemy's offensive system, because if it's not then it's pointless.
</EM><BR>
<P>They already are.  A THAAD missile is far cheaper than the cost of
<BR>
the plutonium for a nuke alone.  Once the design is qualified, the
<BR>
missiles themselves can be spun out by the jillions.  Its then only
<BR>
a series of manufacturing problems, which are easily solved.
<BR>
Mechanically THAAD is fairly simple.  The real magic in that
<BR>
system is in the software.  How expensive is software to copy,
<BR>
once you have it written and debugged?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And if they wanted to be scientific then the team designing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the attacking test vehicle should be completely different from the team designing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the defense.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are in this case.  The blue team builds the targets, the red
<BR>
team builds the interceptor, the white team watches both to make
<BR>
sure nobody cheats.  I can assure you the blue team is doing
<BR>
everything it can do to fool the target discrimination red team.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The attack should not be carefully tuned to the strength of the defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so it's easy to shoot down,  they should probe for weakness, they should do what a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real attacker would do, they should put some very smart people on the job to see if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can come up with simple cheap ways to confuse the ABM.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed.  Intercepting is a tougher problem than spoofing, currently.
<BR>
But remember, all the discrimination satellites are not in service.  Yet...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For example, The Union Of Concerned Scientists has recommended that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; warhead be put inside a Mylar RADAR reflecting balloon so it would look like all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other decoys until the last few seconds of its flight when it entered the atmosphere.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, but of course the Union of Concerned Scientist's credibility is
<BR>
not exactly stellar in this particular field.  For instance, can you imagine
<BR>
a technology (such as a multispectrum laser reflector/detector of some
<BR>
sort) in which a mylar balloon with something inside it would look vastly
<BR>
different from an empty mylar balloon?  A mylar balloon is highly reflective
<BR>
in the limited spectral band our eyes recognize, however in some other
<BR>
spectral bands an aluminized mylar balloon is as transparent as a condom.
<BR>
<P>Also, a warhead can be fired upon after it hits the upper atmosphere
<BR>
and before it develops a plasma sheath, using the Patriot Advanced
<BR>
Capability or PAC3.
<BR>
<P>Since you mentioned the U of CS, there is one possible show-stopper
<BR>
for national missile defense, which has never been mentioned in any of
<BR>
these debates, a really formidable one.  Ive never seen it mentioned in
<BR>
any of the media presentations either.  If you wish, I will share from an
<BR>
insiders view, what is the biggest obstacle to a successful missile shield.
<BR>
Any guesses?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think the reason is that if you can't even pass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a rigged test then it's really pitiful, and with 50,000 or more warheads if your defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't virtually perfect then it's not worth building.
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted it isnt virtually perfect today.  But if we can limp by on
<BR>
diplomacy alone for another 10 years, the system will be formidable.
<BR>
If we can do it for 30 years, it may be virtually perfect.  The argument
<BR>
is that if we cannot go directly from no-defense to a perfect defense
<BR>
then we should stay indefinitely with no-defense?  There are, there
<BR>
*must be* a few intermediate steps!  This is one of them.  Lets sit
<BR>
back and enjoy the show, shall we?  spike
