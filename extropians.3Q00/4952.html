<EM>&gt; I would rather say it's not rational to destroy such diversity and life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself.  No need to appeal to &quot;Extropian.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, commenting on the text Damien quotes (I don't have time now to find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original author), new species are not &quot;popping&quot; into existence all over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the space of taxa.  I don't see, e.g., a new species of bird which has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; popped into existence to replace the dodo or the moa or the carrier pigeon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nor is one waiting in the wings -- at least, in anything shorter than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; geological terms -- to replace the California condor.  (No pun intended.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>What, exactly, does the Condor eat that other vultures cannot? There are no more
<BR>
baby mammoths to chow on.
<BR>
<P>Species don't obviously, evolve in the blink of an eye to occupy an empty niche.
<BR>
Typically one from a neighboring niche expands into it then begins to breed to
<BR>
the optimum for that niche, unless being multi-niche capable is an evolutionary
<BR>
advantage. As an example, I can bring up predators in New England. Cougars have
<BR>
not been seen in New England for more than 100-150 years (or, for that matter,
<BR>
anywhere north of Virginia). Wolves were also driven out in the 19th century,
<BR>
and coyotes were on thin ice. Since the 60's though, first the coyote population
<BR>
rebounded to take over predation jobs of all three, and interbred with stray
<BR>
domesticated dogs to become a larger variant called the coy-dog to go after
<BR>
larger game. The coydog is in size about halfway between a wolf and a coyote
<BR>
(which are typically in about a 2:1 size ratio). Wolves have also returned,
<BR>
coming across the St. Lawrence, apparently, on the ice in winter, and there are
<BR>
also at least a half dozen good sightings of cougars (called catamounts in these
<BR>
parts) each year.
<BR>
At the same time, the pheasant and turkey populations have been moving north.
<BR>
They were both originally not native as far north as I am now, in Wilder, VT and
<BR>
Lebanon, NH, but now range as far as my cabin in upstate NH, where I've seen
<BR>
coyotes going after wild turkey with much enthusiasm.
<BR>
<P>Now, most species are not the sole occupants of their niche in any environment.
<BR>
They typically have competitors, or at least other species that can also occupy
<BR>
that niche as well. However, there have been a number of new bird species
<BR>
popping up, and bird experts are constantly debating if a subspecies has become
<BR>
an indpendent species or not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Someone else remarked about how a lot of land in the Northeast has gone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wild.  This is true in many areas of New England.  Yet, the ecosystems that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existed before the land was tamed are, in most cases, not returning -- at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least, not in toto.  The carrier pigeon is gone and there are hardly any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wolves south of Canada or East of the Mississippi.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, the wolves are here, I've seen them with my own eyes, and I do know
<BR>
the difference between coyotes, wolves, malamutes, german shepherds, etc. The
<BR>
state wildlife offices, though, are preferring to call them 'large coydogs'
<BR>
because they don't want to freak people out.
