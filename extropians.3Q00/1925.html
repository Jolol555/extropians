<EM>&gt;       &gt;No, decoys are supposed to be cheap.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought that's what I just said but perhaps I don't write well English.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, that wasn't clear. It seemed like you were saying it was ok if they cost
<BR>
as much..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &gt;If they cost as much as the real  thing, you might as well stick some nukes on them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly, so how can you make a cheap realistic boost phase decoy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the spy sats looking for launch plumes will look at the temperature of the
<BR>
plume, the size of the plume (possibly its spectral signature as well to figure
<BR>
out what chemicals are being used as fuel), its speed, acceleration, and
<BR>
trajectory angle. Plotting out the trajectory of the missile, and calculating
<BR>
how much fuel of what type is being burned, they can figure out A) What the mass
<BR>
of the total vehicle is at any given point, and therefore whether it is a decoy
<BR>
or a real missile. If you make it the same mass, then you have to use the same
<BR>
amount of fuel in the first and possibly second stages (depends on how long your
<BR>
decoy is supposed to maintain the ruse). The main cost of a solid fuel missile
<BR>
is in fact the solid fuel (not counting the logistics and launch facilities
<BR>
required as well). 
<BR>
<P>My personal opinion is a boost phase decoy is either easy to detect, or else so
<BR>
expensive that its a waste, you might as well just use a real missile with a
<BR>
nuke.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &gt;Actually, Hokkaido Island in Japan is in an excellent position to  launch,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's about a thousand miles away, probably too far.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From North Korea? Its actually about 500 miles coast to coast. Any missile
</EM><BR>
should still be in its upper boost phase at that point as it is passing over,
<BR>
however, they will not necesarily intercept directly overhead, but far out into
<BR>
the Sea of Japan. Radar sites on Honshu, Kyusho and Hokkaido should spot
<BR>
launched missiles before they have acheived more than ten miles altitude (at the
<BR>
very least satellites should detect launch pretty early and notify batteries on
<BR>
Hokkaido) Assuming we are using a Patriot PAC4 missile system, or its advanced
<BR>
THAAD equivalent, and even if the radar is line of sight, battery radars should
<BR>
lock on before the targets are halfway over the sea of Japan, at about 30-40
<BR>
miles altitude, at Mach 3-5 at best.
<BR>
<P>Now, the Japanese may require that all intercepts occur directly overhead, so
<BR>
any radioactive debris passes over and falls into the Pacific.
