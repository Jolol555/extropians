<P><EM>&gt; Yes, that makes sense; organizing in a group amplifies your power, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good or evil.  However corporations and other groups are not inherently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil or wrong, any more than are other power amplification systems like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science and technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A lot of evil contributed to big corporations seem to consist of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; situations where two parties voluntarily cooporate on some effort, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because one of the parties is in a significantly weaker bargaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; position (because of market conditions, lack of information, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whatever), most of the benefit deriving from the effort goes to the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; party (i.e. shareholders of the corporation). Is it evil to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMO it is not evil to engage in interactions which are voluntary for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all parties.  As I understand these situations, the &quot;victim&quot; actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has his situation improved, but just not as much as the victimizer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However I know that many people have a different intuition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely!  The bottom line is that a corporation, because it is bigger has
<BR>
the power of both money and armies of lawyers to screw everyone else.  Sure
<BR>
many companies are not malign.  But what about all the ones that are?  The
<BR>
problem that you continue to overlook is that the malign companies are often
<BR>
able to get away with their 'evil' acts because they have power to pay or
<BR>
legalize the problem away, as is now with the DMCA.
<BR>
<P>Here is my point - in an idealistic legal system you have an arbitrary case of
<BR>
Person X vs. Corp X where justice prevails every time.  But instead the legal
<BR>
system almost always favors the corporation, because they have more people,
<BR>
more money, and more lawyers.  That means that in any legal case, the
<BR>
probability of victory always sides with the one with the most money.
<BR>
<P>To reiterate what I said earlier - the biggest bug in our so-called free-market
<BR>
is that everything is up for grabs (freedom, justice), where he with the most
<BR>
money wins.
