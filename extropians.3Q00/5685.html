<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Since when are Native Americans Socialists or Communists?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Hmmm.  They hunted together and shared the spoils with the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tribe. Each one worked according to his own ability, and consumed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;according to his need.  What would you call that, capitalism?
</EM><BR>
<P>Excuse me, but what tribe are you refering to? I've read
<BR>
ethnologies of various native peoples, but know of no such tribe.
<BR>
<P>It was common practice for hunters to mark or &quot;sign&quot; their arrows
<BR>
specifically so that whose kill it was could be determined
<BR>
especially in large group hunts.
<BR>
<P>A successful hunter with more kills than his immediate family unit
<BR>
could process would receive help from other tribe members in return
<BR>
for a share of the kill. It was also common practice for such
<BR>
hunters to share with the less fortunate. This often greatly
<BR>
enhanced their reputation and status. 
<BR>
<P>One's tribe was essentially an extended family unit, and treated
<BR>
accordingly.
<BR>
<P>No sign of socialism or communism here.
