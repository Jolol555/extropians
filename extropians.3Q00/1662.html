<P>&lt;&lt; Is it really as clear cut as we often make out that SIs would entirely
<BR>
&nbsp;dominate sub-SIs? Or is there some room for competition, based on different
<BR>
&nbsp;requirements? For instance, perhaps those SIs will require so much energy to
<BR>
&nbsp;operate, that there can't be many of them, and they can't really afford the
<BR>
&nbsp;effort required to stomp out all those pesky human-nests. Thoughts?

Just guessing, but the more advanced the supermind, the less concerned with 
<BR>
aquiring raw material and energy they need to be. If there are any superminds 
<BR>
current in this universe, they have not made themselves known to us little 
<BR>
peeplings.
