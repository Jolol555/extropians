Christian &quot;naddy&quot; Weisgerber:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm a bit involved in the Open Source scene.  (From what I read on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this list I gather that for most participants here the Open Source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movement is rather obscure.)  Collaborative projects there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; typically developed by teleworking only.  Social interaction in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the flesh just isn't an option, so it works without.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks for posting this Christian (or should I call you naddy?). I know just
<BR>
a bit more than bugger-all about how Open Source is done, and have been
<BR>
meaning to find out more for a while. Of particular interest to me, it does
<BR>
seem to be a great example of the workability of teleworking.
<BR>
<P>Would you mind posting in a bit more detail about the nitty-gritty of the
<BR>
personal dynamics &amp; group dynamics, all the people stuff which makes or
<BR>
breaks projects, in the world of open source? That goes for anyone else with
<BR>
first hand experience, by the way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As an example, let's consider the OpenBSD project, which provides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a full-fledged unix operating system widely considered to be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most secure one around.  There are a few dozen developers, i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people with write access to the source tree, who are spread all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the globe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Communication is done synchronously by way of a private chat system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and asynchronously by E-mail.  Occasionally, developers bump into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each other at trade shows and have a beer together.  Once or twice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a year, some developers manage to meet somewhere for a few days to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hack (i.e. develop) together.  But for practical purposes, and when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compared to usual office interactions, developers simply don't meet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each other in person, and many never ever do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Despite these circumstances, work progresses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The open source movement must already have a good idea about which project
<BR>
management models work for highly distributed teleworking groups, and which
<BR>
ones don't; there's much for commercial orgs to learn here.
<BR>
<P>Whilst confessing my ignorance of the implementation details of successful
<BR>
open source projects, I must say I'm not convinced by those people who push
<BR>
it as a silver bullet for software development, basically implying that the
<BR>
need for management dissapears. That sounds suspiciously like BS. I'd be
<BR>
very interested in learning more about the failures, actually; I imagine
<BR>
they shed a great deal of light on what's feasible and what's not.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course, Open Source projects are hardly representative of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; common workplace.  We're dealing with highly motivated and highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; qualified people who *want* to collaborate, rather than a set of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so-so employees who do the minimum required to get the next paycheck.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The personal distance introduced by teleworking may also have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantages.  There's little gossip.  Who's sleeping with whom isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an issue and doesn't alienate co-workers.  Some people still can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work with certain others--it would be interesting to see whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal contact would lead to the same groupings.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are absolutely correct in the assessment that teleworking
<BR>
actually has some advantages (and disadvantages) in terms of group dynamics,
<BR>
when compared with traditional, centrally located groups.  I've got a bunch
<BR>
of thoughts about this, which also relate back to the recent Cities/Clusters
<BR>
thread, which I'll try to organize, and will post seperately.
<BR>
