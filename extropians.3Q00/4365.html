<EM>&gt; And to think I was actually beginning to worry when I didn't see predictable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knee-jerk reactions on this issue.  Remember my worry when no one responded to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; initial post after the first two days?  I thought to myself, &quot;where is Michael or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lee Danial Crocker?  Did everyone fall asleep?&quot;  But alas, some things never change,

<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, we've seen much bitching and whining from Paul, but little in the form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; constructive detail.
</EM><BR>
<P>So you were bothered that nobody wanted to play, then when they did you didn't
<BR>
like that either?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So since I came to the debate (this time) with more questions than answers I'm a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whiner now?   
</EM><BR>
<P>Essentially, yes. If you are asking a question, you should expect an answer. If
<BR>
you don't like the answeres you are getting, perhaps you should propose your own
<BR>
answers, and if you do so publicly, you should expect those answers to be
<BR>
critically examined with as much rigor as you have given to those provided by
<BR>
others. The bahavior known as 'being able to dish it out but not taking it' is
<BR>
broadly recognised to be that of a whiner.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It never ceases to amaze me the amount of dogmatism that runs rampant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this list when anyone begins to question the dogma of the tribe (cult?).  
</EM><BR>
<P>So, you are assuming that the list is merely here for you to post your opinions
<BR>
without any critical examination by others? First you complain that nobody is
<BR>
paying attention to you, then you complain that people are paying too much
<BR>
attention to you. I think you need to decide exactly what it is you actually
<BR>
want from this discourse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this case free-markets.  I also prefer free-market solutions over others assuming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can do a better job!  If you don't believe me try searching through the last 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years of archives.  You will find  that beyond all dogma or school of thought, my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goal has always been about maximizing freedom and prosperity for as many people as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.  
</EM><BR>
<P>THis is good to hear. I do recall that you once were not so imbued with statist
<BR>
memes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Apparently unlike many on the list, I'm willing to look at, question and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; challenge any set of beliefs that might shed light on how best to accomplish that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Believe it or not, I'm trying to discover how free-markets can solve some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toughest issues of fairness and protection of civil liberties.  And who better to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; throw these tough 'devils advocate' questions to than the extropians themselves -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the so called spearheaders of free-market ideas?  Oh I forgot, &quot;I have questioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the high sanctity of the free-market church.&quot; &quot;Be gone with you heretic!  Be gone!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You should really listen to yourselves sometimes.  Ever wonder why the majority of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who come across so called Extropian(TM) thinking run away?  More and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people I've come to know as true extropians have completely distanced themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from this movement which to them reeks of excessive dogmatism, irrationalism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hostility, name calling and online bullying.
</EM><BR>
<P>You seem to be getting very hypersensitive about this whole debate. You should
<BR>
expect that if you make statements that have been proven roundly false over the
<BR>
last 100 years, that people will call you on it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A personal note to Max More if your reading -  I still admire you and what you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to achieve, but I have to tell you that the kindred people I know who also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; share the desire of maximizing their personal extropy through life extension,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence increase and space migration have written the Extropy Institute off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long ago as a joke.  Among the intelligentsia I more often than not find myself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defending the institute more than promoting it.  Why is that?
</EM><BR>
<P>What intelligentsia is that? I personally find much of American intelligentsia,
<BR>
especially that centering on New York City and generally the
<BR>
Harvard/Brown/Columbia/Yale humanities crowd to be the greater joke. It is from
<BR>
there that a large amount of the opposition to technological progress
<BR>
originates. Such people accept as a given such dumb ideas that technology is
<BR>
evil, individualism is bad, and commerce is a dirty thing. It should be pretty
<BR>
much accepted that New Yorkers are going to laugh at anything 'not invented
<BR>
here', especially if the original source is California.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The most striking example is the simultaneous promotion of free-market solutions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *without* the guts to back it up with detailed descriptions of how it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accomplish that.  I'm talking about stepping out the clouds of abstraction and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstrating how free-markets can solve such pressing issues as DeCSS, free speech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and other civil liberties.  At most what we have seen is an honest admission that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything including our own sovereignty as individuals is a commodity open to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highest bidder.  &quot;If you can't afford civil rights you don't deserve them.&quot;  esd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recently said.  And my only response was to ask, &quot;what is to keep such prices from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rising beyond the reach of  everyone but the most wealthy?&quot;  Needless to say this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a despicable point of view and class thinking and aristocracy at its worse!  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more can I possibly say in response to such a statement - it has left me speechless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and disgusted.
</EM><BR>
<P>Be disgusted as you like. You can feel that way because you can AFFORD to feel
<BR>
that way. How about that? Most historians, who are not blinded by their own
<BR>
dogma, would agree that most all societies in history practice the morals and
<BR>
ethics they can afford.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In regards to Extropy (TM) I'm certain that it is this unquestioned and dogmatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attitude of free-markets which has driven more people away than all other things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; combined.  I know that people like yourself and Greg Burch have done an admirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job in promoting free-marktets in a positive light - and I commend you both for it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I also know that the list has a life of its own outside of the institute, and you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should not be blamed for what transpires on it.  But you must also realize that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of people are being exposed to the Institute through _this mailing list_,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and it's been scaring them away in droves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Until I can see a more honest and non-hostile attitude that is willing to discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free-market solutions to pressing issues such as DeCSS and basic civil liberties,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm boycotting the institute and this list indefinitely.  This includes actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encouraging as many people as possible to avoid anything related to Extropy(TM)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Institute as well as anyone else who advocates free market solutions that come at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the expense of individual liberty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems to me, at least, to be a rather petulant retort of &quot;if I don't get my
<BR>
way I'm picking up my blocks and going home&quot;. I personally cannot understand
<BR>
where it is coming from. One thing that this list is renowned for is a
<BR>
willingness to discuss things. We are particularly interested in NEW ideas. We
<BR>
may get testy over people repeating DUMB ideas, as most of us dislike wasting
<BR>
our time on what we see as old material.
