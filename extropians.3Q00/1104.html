<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; What about the apparent majority today who can't accept a machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; being &quot;conscious&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   So many people like Kurzweil, Dennitt... make this same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assumption that this will be a problem.  I think this is a gross,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obvious, and stupid mistake, especially for such intelligent people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make.  It seems so obvious to me that when we discover what and how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consciousness really is and start effing quale and stuff (as when the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artificial entity finally honestly says: &quot;Oh !THATS! what salt tastes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like&quot;...), it will be as hard to deny what is and is not conscious as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is to today say the world is flat.
</EM><BR>
<P>People can and do deny the obvious.  Something like 40% of Americans believe
<BR>
the world was created in a big &quot;poof&quot; 6000 years ago.  Slightly over a century
<BR>
ago most people thought that women were intellectually incapable and Africans
<BR>
were basically a different species, in spite of extensive evidence against 
<BR>
both
<BR>
propositions.
<BR>
<P>Thinking machines are very much at odds with most world models including 
<BR>
souls,
<BR>
as well as with many humanistic models in which ethics derive from some 
<BR>
ineffable &quot;humanity&quot;.  In addition, they are a profound potential competitor 
<BR>
to
<BR>
many other people.  Many, many, people will be profoundly motivated to believe
<BR>
that thinking machines aren't &quot;really&quot; thinking and that they do not deserve 
<BR>
human-like rights.  I predict they will believe what they want to believe; in 
<BR>
my 
<BR>
experience the readiness to accept disproof of cherished beliefs is a rare
<BR>
character.
