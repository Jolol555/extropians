oh well, too late now.  i was in melbourne all of last week.  checked out
<BR>
robocup on monday and tuesday for more than 8 hours each day, skipped it on
<BR>
wednesday to recover, and for some reason or other, i completely missed out
<BR>
on the finals (well, i went on sunday but got there at 3:30pm, after they
<BR>
had finished).  i did manage to see every team in the big league and quite a
<BR>
number on the others so i wasn't too upset.  the robots were mostly not that
<BR>
impressive although there were lots of cool things to note.  the winners of
<BR>
the small robot division (cornell university) were quite good, controlling
<BR>
and kicking the ball with a spininning roller pin, going around other
<BR>
robots, shooting for the clearest bit of goal, and even passing the ball
<BR>
among robots (only team i saw doing that in an obviously non-accidental
<BR>
way).  the larger division seemed to be quite a bit slower and dumber, and
<BR>
there was constant human intervention (going into the court to adjust
<BR>
alignments, taking robots out, putting them back in). the aibo programming
<BR>
didn't seem very impressive either but i was quite impressed by the aibos
<BR>
themselves.  i did miss out on the biped demo, did anyone catch any of that?
<BR>
i was surprised by the amount of countries represented, and especially by
<BR>
the very strong iranian showing (quarters on the simulation league,
<BR>
defending champions on the big league, third this year and quite unlucky at
<BR>
that, and developers of the coolest maneouvre on the big league division
<BR>
(they had this &quot;orbit-the-ball&quot; movement which looked great and was a huge
<BR>
tactical advantage)).  One very dissapointing feature of the cup was the
<BR>
amount of focus on the competitiveness of the event, rather than in the
<BR>
technology.  There were constantly arguments about rules and complaints for
<BR>
charges, and 5-second violations (they were quite modified soccer rules),
<BR>
especially from english-speaking countries (i suppose because they could),
<BR>
and lots of overheard conversations and jokes on getting a glimpse at each
<BR>
other's codes as if there were some major research secret in those robots.
<BR>
The simulation league was completely the opposite in this matter, since
<BR>
everyone had to show their code.  It was also much more impressive from a
<BR>
soccer perspective (very realistic looking matches went on there)
<BR>
All in all, not too bad, especially the atmosphere of the place (hundreds of
<BR>
robots in one place, lots of constant tweaking and adjusting), but not much
<BR>
in the technological news front.
