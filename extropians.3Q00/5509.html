<P>13. Nanotechnology disaster Before you've even gotten the keyboard dirty, your
<BR>
home computer is obsolete, largely because of incredibly rapid progress in
<BR>
miniaturizing circuits on silicon chips. Engineers are using the same technology
<BR>
to build crude, atomic-scale machines, inventing a new field as they go called
<BR>
nanotechnology. Within a few decades, maybe sooner, it should be possible to
<BR>
build microscopic robots that can assemble and replicate themselves. They might
<BR>
perform surgery from inside a patient, build any desired product from simple raw
<BR>
materials, or explore other worlds. All well and good if the technology works as
<BR>
intended. Then again, consider what K. Eric Drexler of the Foresight Institute
<BR>
calls the &quot;grey goo problem&quot; in his book Engines of Creation, a cult favorite
<BR>
among the nanotech set. After an industrial accident, he writes, bacteria-sized
<BR>
machines, &quot;could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the
<BR>
biosphere to dust in a matter of days.&quot; And Drexler is actually a strong
<BR>
proponent of the technology. More pessimistic souls, such as Bill Joy, a
<BR>
cofounder of Sun Microsystems, envision nano-machines as the perfect precision
<BR>
military or terrorist tools.
<BR>
<P>16. Robots take over People create smart robots, which turn against us and take
<BR>
over the world. Yawn. We've seen this in movies, TV, and comic books for
<BR>
decades. After all these years, look around and still- no smart robots. Yet Hans
<BR>
Moravec, one of the founders of the robotics department of Carnegie Mellon
<BR>
University, remains a believer. By 2040, he predicts, machines will match human
<BR>
intelligence, and perhaps human consciousness. Then they'll get even better. He
<BR>
envisions an eventual symbiotic relationship between human and machine, with the
<BR>
two merging into &quot;postbiologicals&quot; capable of vastly expanding their
<BR>
intellectual power. Marvin Minsky, an artificial-intelligence expert at MIT,
<BR>
foresees a similar future: People will download their brains into
<BR>
computer-enhanced mechanical surrogates and log into nearly boundless files of
<BR>
information and experience. Whether this counts as the end of humanity or the
<BR>
next stage in evolution depends on your point of view. Minsky's vision might
<BR>
sound vaguely familiar. After the first virtual-reality machines hit the
<BR>
marketplace around 1989, feverish journalists hailed them as electronic LSD,
<BR>
trippy illusion machines that might entice the user in and then never let him
<BR>
out. Sociologists fretted that our culture, maybe even our species, would
<BR>
whither away. When the actual experience of virtual reality turned out to be
<BR>
more like trying to play Pac-Man with a bowling ball taped to your head, the
<BR>
talk died down. To his credit, Minsky recognizes that the merger of human and
<BR>
machine lies quite a few years away.
