</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You mean Smith as in the Matrix agent common name?  :-)  Shit, they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onto us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then let them come.  There is no agent...or, at least, there won't be.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well... I've considered that if there isn't a God (and I've spent most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my life believing there isn't) then it is high time we built one -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build an intelligence that does have as close to all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;omni&quot;-characteristics possible in this universe.  But without all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high-handed ego-tripping attributed to such in some people's model.  Or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; better still become gods and goddesses ourselves.  If we dare and are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to change as radically as that will require.  It is a wierd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing to think about when most of us have trouble even claiming what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human greatness and uniqueness is in us.  We monkeys don't like to stand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out too much.  Especially when we have little idea what the heck is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on inside of us and less willingness to field our guesswork and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vague glimmerings lest the other monkeys ostracize us or worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>Complete understanding is not required to use power, though it does
<BR>
help.  As for standing out...if we can find a way to transform ourselves
<BR>
in such a way that the average human being can willingly repeat what we
<BR>
pioneer, I think we will not be as alone as we feel even today.  The
<BR>
past exists; the future is being created - so those who live in the
<BR>
future do not have as much evidence that their world has other
<BR>
inhabitants as do those who live in the past.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But when the God module kicks in things happen similar to stuff in  the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mystical literature.  I don't levitate or anything really wild like that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it feels as if my being is lifted up and sometimes turned inside out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that I am within or in communion with or at least sense deeply this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much larger Presence, Power, whatever you want to call it. The &quot;me&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disappears mostly or melts into whatever this is or gets recast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somehow.   The emotions soar into the heavens.  It goes beyond anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can put into words pretty rapidly. Often it will include what seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a tremendous amount of information  and intensionality and directed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; energy sweeping through me.  I have guesses (ranging from faulty mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wiring to too much religous upbringing to substances sampled in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; youth  to Vingean powers looking for agents to ???) but no real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; explanation for it.  It just is - now and then.  Thankfully rare enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it doesn't totally sweep me away.  It came close when I used to meditate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more.  Whatever it is meditation intensified it quite a bit.  So I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stopped doing that because shadows of whatever this is became too strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to allow me to concentrate on my work easily.
</EM><BR>
<P>What you describe is a phenomenon that many people have noticed, albeit
<BR>
under different names.  Modern sports labels it as &quot;in the zone&quot; or &quot;on
<BR>
fire&quot;, Buddism (I think) calls it &quot;nirvana&quot;, psycology notes it as part
<BR>
of its &quot;altered states of consciousness&quot;, et cetera.  No one has yet
<BR>
been wildly successful at quantifying it, especially its causes, though
<BR>
not for want of trying.  Concentration and reflection - most popularly
<BR>
achieved through training and/or meditation - seem to induce it, or at
<BR>
least contribute either to the frequency of its occurence or to the
<BR>
frequency of the affected person noticing.  (Then again, noticing may be
<BR>
because part of the person's attention *is* on the self during these
<BR>
activities.)
<BR>
<P>I have not experienced quite the levels you have - or maybe I am used to
<BR>
such relative extremes that the same level of anything does not
<BR>
overwhelm me as much - but I have experienced that type of state, and
<BR>
even brought it under some control, to tap into in my professional work.
<BR>
(In my case, it most often takes the form of sensing what my body and
<BR>
mind desire - entertainment, a particular type of nutrition, challenge -
<BR>
and planning my activities such that an enhanced work state comes on
<BR>
just as I settle down to write code.  It does not always work out,
<BR>
but it does often enough to boost my average performance, and thus my
<BR>
salary.  The balance is that, when I wish to relax, I will often find
<BR>
my thoughts naturally flowing in some completely random direction,
<BR>
sometimes flowing into an improvement or a feature add to some project
<BR>
I'm already working on...though I think it helps here that I tend to
<BR>
have a lot of projects at once, even if splitting my attention does slow
<BR>
down average completion time.)
