<EM>&gt; &gt;Actually, there is no evidence that butterflies are harmed by pesticides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;produced by plants in the field, and evidence to the contrary has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;overwhelming that the 'sky is falling' whines of the anti-GM greenies is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;unfounded in any way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The case I read was about GM crops, not pesticides ...
</EM><BR>
<P>The GM crops referred to are varieties of corn and wheat that produces
<BR>
its own pesticide (much like other plants produce their own pesticides),
<BR>
thus repelling parasites. In laboratory tests, where monarch butterflies
<BR>
were given NOTHING else to eat but the GM plants, they did eat them and
<BR>
did become sterilized and died. Where the butterflies were given a
<BR>
choice between plants to eat, they avoided the GM plants. The Greens
<BR>
have not acknowledged this fact, and have demonstrated a rather unique
<BR>
case of selective literacy and memory.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for 'spores' being 'freed' into the environment, plants do not reproduce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'spores', so any greenies telling you that are obviously ignorant. Since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agronomists are aware of the risks, they typically plant a band of crops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; test fields that cannot cross pollinate with the test plants. THe pollen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drifts so far before settling to the ground, where it rots.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, spores, pollen whatever ... I'm not a biologist .... but tell me how you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can stop cross-pollination (by wind or insects) by planting a band of crops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around a test field? What self-respecting bee or wasp will be put off by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, first off wasps do not pollinate plants or produce honey, they
<BR>
predate on other insects and their nests are not built of honeycomb, but
<BR>
out of paper created by chewing wood and leaves (although their nests
<BR>
are structured similarly with hexagonal shapes.)
<BR>
<P>As for bees, GM crops are typically tested in areas where there are
<BR>
little or no native bee populations. If you were not aware, most of the
<BR>
native bees in North America died off a couple years ago due to the
<BR>
depradations of a *naturally* evolved fungal infection epidemic (showing
<BR>
that evolution itself still has far more impact upon our environment
<BR>
than we think we do in our hubris). Most farmers these days have been
<BR>
dependent upon bee breeders to bring their hives around to provide help
<BR>
with pollenation. Due to this, we have unique conditions where it is
<BR>
relatively easy to find areas that are free of bees, and to keep them
<BR>
free of bees, and where crops pollinate each other via wind conducted
<BR>
pollen.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Just because a technology is new, like GM, does not automatically mean it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; good. Proper long term testing does not seem to have occurred with GM in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; same way as a new drug testing, although the technology impacts on more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Just because technology is new does not mean you have to fear it like the H
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Bomb.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Proper testing has progressed as far as it can in the laboratories. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;tested in the field, but all attempts at this testing are being sabotaged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anti-GM greenies, which proves that they are not, in fact, interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'proper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;testing'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If they still have to be tested in the field .... how come so much GM soya
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is already on the supermarket shelves? What point are you making here?
</EM><BR>
<P>The anti-GM forces don't go after established GM crops that are already
<BR>
in the environment and which have shown no negative impact. They go
<BR>
after research plots where new strains are being tested in the open.
<BR>
They know they can't put the genie of established GM crops back in the
<BR>
bottle, but they can fight a delaying war, impeding and sabotaging
<BR>
efforts to introduce new varieties of GM crops.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That is merely a straw man for them to present themselves as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;'moderate' while they vilify their opponents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think that until science can ensure that neighbouring crops won't become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pollinated by GM test crops, the environmentalists have a point.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since established GM crops and animal species have shown absolutely no
<BR>
negative impact to date, the fears of the luddites are pretty much
<BR>
unfounded. They take the rather rational concern about keeping
<BR>
potentially endemic species from getting loose, and blow it way out of
<BR>
proportion. They have shown absolutely no interest in actually
<BR>
participating in work to ensure that potentially dangerous crops are
<BR>
safe for the environment. All they are interested in is sabotage. Their
<BR>
real goals have only a little to do with their stated goals of
<BR>
environmental concern, and have much more to do with preventing the US
<BR>
gengineering industry from enabling the farmers of the world to keep
<BR>
feeding the people of the world, because they know that well fed people
<BR>
are far less likely to seek revolution. It is not an accident that these
<BR>
anti-GM groups are organized around and with the help of established
<BR>
marxist and maoist groups, in and around communist, socialist, wobbly,
<BR>
and other radical leftist bookstores and reading rooms around the
<BR>
country. These are the facts that they don't want to admit to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surely we should err on the side of  caution ...... we just don't know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large-scale GM cultivation will impact on the environment. The dangers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; H-bombs &amp;c. is all too apparent, but some new technologies might have more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subtle dangers. We are not living in sci-fi fantasy .... if things go wrong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the world they effect real lives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Plant pollen is not like grey goo, so stop giving it that level of
<BR>
alarmism. It is more like a forest fire, which it is possible to fight
<BR>
and contain and eliminate (much as we have eliminated smallpox and other
<BR>
diseases).
