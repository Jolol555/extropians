<EM>&gt; I cannot imagine this kind of killings going on in the Balkans and not

<EM>&gt; drawing the Russians in, as well as the Croats, and the Albanians, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basically; because it would have continued in full forced would have

<EM>&gt; under-mined Europe elsewhere. Its a domino theory, but one, without some

kind
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of intervention, would have eventually worked itself into a larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflagration.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny that this scenario did not happen in the ten years the recent troubles
<BR>
have been going on for.  Since the early 1990s, a lot of pundits in America
<BR>
and Europe have argued that the Balkan conflicts would spread.  In fact,
<BR>
they did not.  Only in 1994-5 did NATO get involved and then in came in on
<BR>
the side of Bosnian Muslims (where it pretty much allowed them to attack
<BR>
Bosnia Serbs; also allowed Croatia a free hand against Serbs in its region
<BR>
with no complaints from Russia).  NATO and most outside parties, including
<BR>
the Russians, did not get deeply involved again until the 1999 Kosovo War.
<BR>
<P>If the Balkans conflicts were going to spread, they would have spread a lot
<BR>
sooner.  Most of the bloodies fighting is now over and has been over for
<BR>
years.  So the &quot;war will spread if we don't stop it&quot; theory appears
<BR>
discredited in this case.
<BR>
<P>(BTW, Albania is no shape to hurt anyone.  Albanian arms might support the
<BR>
KLA, but this is not because the Albanian army or government is involved.
<BR>
Rather, that nations government and military pretty much have collapsed.
<BR>
This has created an arms market because soldiers are selling weapons for
<BR>
food and other goods.  Albania, right now, is incapable of doing any
<BR>
military operations beyond its borders -- that is, very unlikely to get
<BR>
involved in any Balkan conflict as a participant.)
<BR>
<P>Add to this, Europeans in general were not getting involved until a major US
<BR>
effort to get them involved was underway.  No grand alliances formed among
<BR>
pro- or anti-Serb lines.  The 1990s were not like the 1900s and the 1910s.
<BR>
(Part of the difference is, of course, the two empires that existed back
<BR>
then and were disintegrating -- Ottoman Empire and Austro-Hungary -- are no
<BR>
longer around.  Also, the alliance system of that time is no longer in
<BR>
existence.  Europe in the 1990s and now is not divided by two major
<BR>
alliances.  In fact, I'd bet Europe is likely to be separated now in this
<BR>
way -- if things stay the same, e.g., the Russians don't suddenly get their
<BR>
military will and strength back -- than ever before.)
