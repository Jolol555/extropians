<EM>&gt;Subject: God &amp; stuff (was: Re: just me)

<EM>&gt;Date: Sun, 17 Sep 2000 23:04:28 PDT

</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can't imagine that any of the world religions have a lock on any sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real &quot;supernatural&quot; ontology.  But I always get kick out of atheists who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smugly claim that there is no god.  I don't claim that there is a god.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact of the matter is that the data are inconclusive.  But there are some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;things we do know: the universe is here; it got here somehow; and we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know how.
</EM><BR>
<P>But of all the possibilities that could have brought it to be, that of an 
<BR>
intelligent and all powerful being is the most absurd.
<BR>
To attribute the first causes to a God only makes things much more 
<BR>
complicated when you ask the obvious question - where did God come from? 
<BR>
It's certainly a lot more difficult to explain the origin of intelligence 
<BR>
from nothing then it is to explain a singularity (a physical singularity) 
<BR>
from nothing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I realize that is not reason enough to claim that it must have been built 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Jehovah (Allah, Jesus, fill in the blank).  But some time back, before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;big bang, before the first of perhaps almost infinitely many big bangs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there was a *first* cause.
</EM><BR>
<P>Keep applying the same logic, and you have to admit there must have been a 
<BR>
*zeroth* cause as well, as well as a *negative first* to explain that one.. 
<BR>
ad infinitum. This tells me something is inadequate about our conception of 
<BR>
time.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Energy is conserved, meaning it is neither created nor destroyed.  Can that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mean that energy and/or matter have *always* existed?  Is that any easier 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe than the story that God has always existed?  Not for me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not? I find it much easier (though still difficult) to believe that a 
<BR>
hydrogen atom has always existed then to believe that an intelligent entity 
<BR>
has. If you find it more or equally plausable that intelligence could exist 
<BR>
with no origin, then why trace it all the way back to God? Why not just 
<BR>
postulate that humans, as intelligent beings, have existed for all eternity.
<BR>
You seem to be hinting at the argument that God could exist by taking the 
<BR>
first cause, and calling it God. This is a legitimate linguistic and 
<BR>
philosophical tool, but if you take this route, I wouldn't expect God to 
<BR>
have any of the properties generally ascribed to him, such as having 
<BR>
intelligence, or being any kind of &quot;being&quot; at all.
<BR>
A side note: the concept of an all-powerful being is internally 
<BR>
inconsistent, because there is one thing he could not do: create a being 
<BR>
more powerful then himself. If he could do that, then he's not &quot;all 
<BR>
powerful&quot;, because if it's possible for a being more powerful then him to 
<BR>
exist, there must be at least one power he does not have. And if he cannot 
<BR>
do that, then he's not all powerful in the first place.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Don't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me wrong, I no longer believe in the God I was taught about in Sunday
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;school.  But in light of the number and fundamentality of the unanswerable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;questions, I can't see how one could claim with any sort of certainty that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;God does not exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are driving your car and look down at the gas gage and see that it 
<BR>
says your tank is full, can you believe with any certainty that your tank is 
<BR>
actually full? Of course - even though you could think of a number of 
<BR>
possible reasons why this may not be the case - such as that the gage may be 
<BR>
stuck.
<BR>
But I cannot think of any possible explanations or evidence for the 
<BR>
existence of any God. I can claim the God does not exist with much more 
<BR>
certainty then I can claim that my gas gage works.
