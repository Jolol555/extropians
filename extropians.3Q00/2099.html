Hi Lee, how's it going?
<BR>
<P>It seems you might have missed the fact that my last posting was a reply to
<BR>
a message from Terry Donaghe-- I'll fill in the particulars:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; This argument is getting boring... &quot;You can't own it, you can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; track it, you can't control it, so why even bother?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Which is a defeatist attitude.  There are two distinct issues here:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a) is it -desirable- to own it? and b) is it -possible- to own it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Arguing against 'b' is not a good way to argue against 'a.'  If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *is* desirable then we should get more imaginative about making it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possible.  If it's *not* desirable, then you should argue that position.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You apparently reading different arguments than I am.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's the part of Terry's message to which I was responding:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The
<BR>
recording industry (and the motion picture industry and the book publishers,
<BR>
etc. etc.) can whine all they want, but their claim is akin to me claiming
<BR>
that I own all the air in a 20 foot radius about my body - I can't keep
<BR>
anyone from breathing it, I can't track everyone who is breathing it or has
<BR>
previously breathed it, and I don't even know where all of it is at any
<BR>
given time.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Basically its an argument from impossibility, to which I was objecting.
<BR>
<P><P>Clearly, I don't think that, and I don't use
<BR>
<EM>&gt; inevitability as a reason for supporting my ethical point of view.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, -you- didn't.  It's good, because as you've stated, you (and I) are
<BR>
already in a war against some pretty big so-called 'inevitabilities.'
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If we decide we want to be able to protect something that comes out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; our own head, then we look for ways to do so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've never argued against that either, so long as the methods are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological rather than government force.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, so it looks like we agree to some extent as to the ends, but not the
<BR>
means.  I don't really have a problem with operating under a social contract
<BR>
that forces me to relinquish *some* of my freedom if it creates an operating
<BR>
environment that is superior.  In fact, I take it as a given that I cannot
<BR>
expect absolute freedom if I wish to continue to interact with the human
<BR>
race.  I'm actually in favor of using both technology and social engineering
<BR>
to create those environments.  My suspicion is that neither alone will be
<BR>
sufficient for long.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; You claim that encryption will be only a minor annoyance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the future: if that's true, then we've got some big issues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who has claimed this?  Certainly not I, or anyone I remember in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this discussion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I quote from Terry's message:
<BR>
<P>&quot;As bandwidth increases along with similar increases in storage space,
<BR>
processing speed and number of connected users, all digital information
<BR>
located anywhere on the Internet will eventually be available to anyone at
<BR>
anyplace - at no or negligible cost.  Encryption can just slow the process
<BR>
down a bit.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I.E.: Insecurity is inevitable and encryption is not going to be a
<BR>
significant factor.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; They should be able to make the determination of what stays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; private and what becomes public.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely.  But once they make it public, /they shouldn't be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to change their decision/ and enforce that change of mind with guns.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hehehe... guns, huh?
<BR>
<P>I don't see things quite as black and white.  Why must something be either
<BR>
absolutely controlled or totally free?  Why can't we operate under social
<BR>
conditions that allow me to maintain ownership over stuff that comes out of
<BR>
my brain, while still sharing it will lots of people?  Or does this sound
<BR>
like I want to have my cake and eat it too?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; And in the absence of good technological security, do I think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we should collectively agree to protect that information through legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; means?  Absolutely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't like arguing counterfactuals since there /will/ be technological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means, but I'm still not clear what you mean by &quot;protect&quot; here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, I -hope- there will be technological means also, but the point is that
<BR>
currently, there aren't.  This is not a counterfactual.
<BR>
<P>Do you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; mean some way of creating the legal fiction that a certain piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information has never been &quot;released&quot; (an odd concept, but one I might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to support) or the state of current IP law, which tries to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it both ways, both publicly released and &quot;protected&quot; from competition?
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, yeah, the second one.
<BR>
<P>Am I the only one who is not disturbed by this apparent contradiction?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; People always get up in arms about this: &quot;I don't want government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bureaucracy interfering with my freedom!&quot;  But humans have always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understood the importance of social contracts, ever since the first time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we figured out that the right of your fist ends where the right of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nose begins.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How is a social contract necessary to redress torts like this?  Doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; civil law (which can be privately produced) address this well?
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe it can.  You'll have to give me an example of how this might work in
<BR>
practice.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; I anticipate us requiring more intricate rule sets to enable us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; successfully interact with each other in the future and this is simply a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; testament to the increasing complexity and depth of those interactions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Complexity does not /necessarily/ indicate progress.  Sometimes simpler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is better.  Sometimes it's not.  But that statement, whether made by you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or me, has no content until you talk about /specifically/ which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complications you favor and /why/.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's no mystery-- the 'complexity' we are discussing are the laws
<BR>
surrounding intellectual property.
<BR>
<P>I currently favor them to the extent that they grant the creator ownership
<BR>
over his/her work, which to me represents the empowerment of the creator.
<BR>
Additional complexity might result from how that creator chooses to
<BR>
relinquish or impart that ownership, partially or completely, etc. and the
<BR>
various benefits that will accrue from such relinquishment.  Again, I say,
<BR>
if you don't want to pay me for my work, what makes you think you have a
<BR>
right to it?  Shouldn't the creator have the freedom to determine how those
<BR>
rights will be allotted?  I don't care if the arrangement is intricate, I
<BR>
just think the default state should favor the person who came up with the
<BR>
damn thing.
