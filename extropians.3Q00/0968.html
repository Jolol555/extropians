</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; WHich is bullshit. Lars claims that MP3 downloads are a 'perfect' reproduction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the digital track. Not true. MP3 downloads are perfect reproductions of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; original MP3 file on the server whish is an imperfect reproduction of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; original CD master. MP3 is nowhere near CD quality. The claim of 'perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reproduction' is a false straw man the recording industry is trying to use to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; shut down this format specifically because it has outcompeted their own file
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; format that is licensable, trackable, and able to be controlled on a pay per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; play basis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, Mike, but your argument is philosophically irrelevant because even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if existing MP3 technology is not perfect, prefect reproduction is trivial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and will be commonplace as technology advances.  Even on a DSL line today,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can download a 100% faithful CD track in lossless WAV format in a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonable time.  And no digital format will ever be &quot;secure&quot; except on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; secure hardware, and even that is dubious.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, no. If the file is encrypted such that each successive play requires a
<BR>
new key to decrypt, which must be downloaded from the recording company's
<BR>
keyserver on a pay per play basis (i.e. no key can be used twice on the same
<BR>
downloaded file), then you have a very secure file format.
<BR>
<P>While 100% faithful WAV format files are quite obviously violations of
<BR>
copyright, its more a question of value. I pay $15.00 for a 10 song CD from
<BR>
Metallica, making each CD quality song worth $1.50 to me, regardless of how many
<BR>
times I choose to play it, how many other people are present when I choose to
<BR>
play it, or what small samples of it I choose to play. On the other end of the
<BR>
scale, an FM radio quality track of the same song is worth nothing to me, as I
<BR>
receive such transmissions for free over my FM radio. Thus any downloaded file
<BR>
over the internet that is of FM broadcast quality is also of zero value to me on
<BR>
a value for quality basis. How you scale the gap between FM broadcast quality
<BR>
and CD quality and the attendant value of points between is obviously up for
<BR>
debate, but at no point should the artist expect to make more than $1.50 per
<BR>
song to give me permanent play rights to that song in any quality format for my
<BR>
own private non-commercial use.
<BR>
<P>Then you have the question of non-commercial use. If I throw a house party, and
<BR>
play Metallica music, I am not violating copyright in allowing 300 of my closest
<BR>
friends to listen to my purchased Metallica CDs. Even if I am charging my
<BR>
friends for their consumption of my beer am I regarded to be violating
<BR>
copyright, since I am not charging for their use of the music (since I don't
<BR>
charge my neighbors for the benefits of the spillover sound).
<BR>
<P>Now, imagine a virtual ongoing house party on the web, where I am playing MP3
<BR>
tracks I recorded off of my legally purchased CDs for the entertainment of my
<BR>
thousands of friends. I am not charging my friends for the use of my tracks, for
<BR>
which I paid a legal license in my purchase of the CD, so I am not violating
<BR>
copyrights because I am not profiting off of the use of the music.
<BR>
<P>Napster is not in violation of copyright law because it does not itself engage
<BR>
in the distribution of MP3 tracks for profit, it produces software that allows
<BR>
people to trade MP3 tracks, with NO method of exchanging any payment for the
<BR>
trade of MP3 files. Napster software users MIGHT be in violation of copyright if
<BR>
they are charging a fee for the distribution of MP3 files via the Napster
<BR>
software, which Metallica and the rest of the recording industry has not been
<BR>
able to prove.
