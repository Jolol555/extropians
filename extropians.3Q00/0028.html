<P><EM>    &gt;Next Friday there will be an attempted intercept of a missile with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;missile. Nowthen, I will make the following speculation: if the intercept
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;fails, it will make jubilant headlines on the front page of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;San Jose Mercury News.  If on the other hand the intercept
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;succeeds, this same organization will mumble a few lines buried
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;deep within,
</EM><BR>
<P>I predict that if the government claims a success then intelligent people will be
<BR>
highly skeptical since in the past every claim of a successful test, without
<BR>
exception, has turned out to be rigged. Not one test has been realistic.
<BR>
Missile defense is economics, so if they were smart they'd conduct a study
<BR>
to see if there is any way their proposed defensive system can be made cheaper
<BR>
than an enemy's offensive system, because if it's not then it's pointless. If they want
<BR>
to convince people then all test results should be declassified, not just the results
<BR>
that make them look good. And if they wanted to be scientific then the team designing
<BR>
the attacking test vehicle should be completely different from the team designing
<BR>
the defense. The attack should not be carefully tuned to the strength of the defense
<BR>
so it's easy to shoot down,  they should probe for weakness, they should do what a
<BR>
real attacker would do, they should put some very smart people on the job to see if
<BR>
they can come up with simple cheap ways to confuse the ABM.
<BR>
For example, The Union Of Concerned Scientists has recommended that the
<BR>
warhead be put inside a Mylar RADAR reflecting balloon so it would look like all the
<BR>
other decoys until the last few seconds of its flight when it entered the atmosphere.
<BR>
The cost of doing this would be almost zero but the military said it has no interest in
<BR>
doing so. You can bet that a real enemy would have an interest in doing so. They
<BR>
also wouldn't take pains to ensure that the decoys were perfectly symmetrical
<BR>
and few in number.
<BR>
<P>I don't think the reason the editors of the San Jose Mercury News think believe
<BR>
is bigger news than success is that they're monsters and like the idea that there
<BR>
is no defense against an H bomb. I think the reason is that if you can't even pass
<BR>
a rigged test then it's really pitiful, and with 50,000 or more warheads if your defense
<BR>
isn't virtually perfect then it's not worth building.
