<P>
This all reminds me of a little exchange from the movie Star Trek IV:
<BR>
<P>Near the end of the movie, they have successfully captured two whales, and
<BR>
are ready to head back into the future. On the ship Spock is concerned that
<BR>
he is having trouble making the _exact_ calculations required to get them
<BR>
back to the future. Without exact figures to work with, he says that there
<BR>
may be no way to proceed and get back to the future successfully. Dr. McCoy
<BR>
I believe then informs him that he should take a GUESS- an educated one.
<BR>
Spock seems to consider all the possibilities, and comes to the conclusion
<BR>
that he would rather take a guess and try to get them back to the future
<BR>
rather than let everyone die.
<BR>
<P>Here we have many people stuck in a similar dilemma- without perfect
<BR>
knowledge of how an AI-produced Singularity will play out, they are extremely
<BR>
hesitant to go forward. However what they must realize is that an educated
<BR>
guess is the best we can do in some cases such as this, and compared to the
<BR>
alternatives it is the only rational choice.
