<EM>&gt;  As the size of the benefit gets up into the trillions of dollars, the

<EM>&gt; effects start to resemble making one person a world dictator. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this kind of consideration that would probably cause me to oppose a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;benefit&quot; of this sort that exceeded something like $100 billion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I will be reluctant to believe people who are claiming they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support giving someone $100 trillion until they explain why they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't deterred by the maxim &quot;power corrupts&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do I get advanced (relative to most of the world) warning as to who this
<BR>
individual will be?  If so, then I can get a head start on corrupting
<BR>
the recipient towards my views, like so:
<BR>
<P>* Cyber, nano, AI, etc. mean more power for those who master them
<BR>
<P>* Easiest way to get this is to fund its development for everyone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* You still get a big head start; others can catch up, but by then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you're doing something which might win you everything forever (this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is probably a minor lie)
<BR>
<P>* I can make this stuff for whoever funds me
<BR>
<P>And just as the recipient is pondering this, the money arrives...
<BR>
<P>Who says you can't use evil in the service of good?  ^_^
