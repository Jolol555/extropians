<P>
Well, it's fairly clear that the loudest voices on this list are fairly 
<BR>
rightist, with a few leftist leaning individuals as well.  But the fact remains
<BR>
that there is still the kind of political fundamentalism that renders any sort
<BR>
of meaningful political discourse useless.
<BR>
<P>Yes, likening the right-wing death squads in Colombia to PPL/J was a little 
<BR>
disingenious - but I chose the references carefully.  Those squads represent
<BR>
a group of people who feel that their own military is not doing enough to
<BR>
protect them, and have instead pressed for a NGO to come in and take care
<BR>
of the peacekeeping that they so desperately want.  If there weren't those
<BR>
that supported the role of these squads as upholding their particular
<BR>
&quot;law and order&quot;, they wouldn't exist.  Most PPL/J scenarios I have read end
<BR>
up eventually boiling down to some sort of coercive tactics, unless and until
<BR>
you change the core of human nature.
<BR>
<P>This is, however, aside from the point.  The old political spectrum, right vs.
<BR>
left, is crumbling, at least in the US.  The arguements between right and left
<BR>
are falling apart, and none too soon, I think.  Quite frankly, I'm glad the 
<BR>
Republicans managed to keep most of their bigots and small-minded people - it's
<BR>
a good counter to the race supremacists and radical feminists on the Democratic
<BR>
side.  And it shows the Republican stance to be as morally bankrupt as the 
<BR>
Democratic one.
<BR>
<P>The issue hereis that political systems as we understand them do not scale.
<BR>
Whatever your governmental system is, they do not scale well enough to our 
<BR>
current geopolitical reality.  This holds true for anarchism, libertarianism,
<BR>
fascism, stalinism, socialism, communism, democracy, republic - the combination
<BR>
of population and land area has outstripped the ability of our technology to
<BR>
continue.  Who herehonestly believes that any of our existing (or recently
<BR>
existing) governments would be capable of administrating a thriving extra-
<BR>
terrestrial colony?  The distances are too vast for our current technology to
<BR>
&quot;glue&quot; together.
<BR>
<P>So all this talk about right vs. left, socialism vs. libertarianism, is simply
<BR>
rearranging the deck chairs.  Government does best what it is SIZED to do - 
<BR>
the federal governent f the US does not get in the business of marriage 
<BR>
licenses, hunting licenses, traffic violations, etc. except in the grossest
<BR>
possible way, because it is not sized to deal with these issues.  Conversely,
<BR>
the failure of the Cofederacy involved the inability of the central government
<BR>
at the time to collect the taxes necssary for the meager few services it DID
<BR>
provide (i.e. military and diplomatic roles).
<BR>
<P>I am going to commit what I have come to believe is a heresy amongst this 
<BR>
group - I am an environmentalist.  Not one of these luddite neolith 
<BR>
philosophers who would give back fire if they could.  But quite honestly, I 
<BR>
do NOT think that corporate or personal interest trumps all.  It's the Tragedy
<BR>
of the Commons - one company (DuPont) can go a little lax on safety mechanisms
<BR>
and kill tens of thousands of people (Bhopal, India, 1984) and those people
<BR>
never had a chance to protect themselves.  I get headaches from being behind 
<BR>
poorly tuned diesel vehicles - this is NOT healthy!  But there is nothing I
<BR>
as one person can do without some sor tof advocacy group with enough teeth to
<BR>
make sure that I can breathe clean air and drink clean water.  And simply
<BR>
joining a group like the Sierra Club won't guarantee that - they have no 
<BR>
enfrcement power.  My life is continually jeopardized, in small amounts, by
<BR>
peopel who operate vehicles without meeting smog regulations, who dump small 
<BR>
amounts of contaminants in aquefers, who spray known cancer-causing pesticides
<BR>
on their crops because its cheap.  Free markets will never provide this
<BR>
sort of environmental protection.  It is always a race to the bottom - because
<BR>
even though _I_ may elect to buy organic produce, or produce grown without the 
<BR>
use of DDT, the cheaper produce grabs the greatest market share.  If you think
<BR>
I'm lying, conside this:  Produce from Mexico can be grown using DDT, then
<BR>
imported into the US.  This produce, despite crossing national boundaries, 
<BR>
is about 5-10% cheaper than stuff grown here in CA.  Regardless of the health 
<BR>
risks, which produce sells better?  The cheaper stuff.
<BR>
<P>Many things can be decided by the free market - I will not argue this.  But it
<BR>
is NOT and should never be considered a panacea, let alone an infallible
<BR>
deity.  Anythign in excess is a vice, including moderation. (pardon the poor
<BR>
paraphrase and lack of attribution - I don't have my Bartlett's handy)
<BR>
<P>The point I'm making is simply this:  Government is pretty much a necessary 
<BR>
evil, by moderating the worst excesses of the market, as well as by moderating 
<BR>
the paternal/maternal instincts of the citizenry and the more demanding and 
<BR>
radical elements of personal philosophy.  Local government does best when its
<BR>
dealing with individual issues - property boundary disputes, petty crime, 
<BR>
traffic enforcement.  Regional government does best with regional-level 
<BR>
issues - such things as general licensing requirements, health and education 
<BR>
services over broad regions.  So-called &quot;national&quot; governments do very well at
<BR>
diplomacy, military service, and certain high-level functions that affect and
<BR>
require a larger geographic base than any administrative region could
<BR>
reasonably run.  But at the increasingly high levels of abstraction, there 
<BR>
should be less and less direct influence on the individual, save in specialized
<BR>
and/or rare circumstances (an army is invading - of course the national 
<BR>
government will have an effect on its poeple - especially those in the warzone)
<BR>
<P>No governance is anarchy.  Anything else is some form of totalitarianism.  Yes,
<BR>
even libertarianism.  I cannot be truly &quot;free&quot; in a libertarian society, and
<BR>
actually I feel in the end I woul dbe less free than I would be in the American
<BR>
constitutional system as it was practiced prior to the Civil War, though this
<BR>
is a discussionf or a later time, another place, since it SHOULD have no 
<BR>
bearing on this list.
<BR>
<P>What DOES have bearing here is the notion of what form of governance would
<BR>
work best for an extropian world?  I have my reasons for believing that a
<BR>
libertarian &quot;government&quot; (if it could be even called that - what would it do?)
<BR>
is not the most effctive nor efficient way to accomplish this end.  Some sort
<BR>
of scalable representation, with ever more diffuse power structures at the 
<BR>
outer layers, would make more sense to me at least - let the government at the
<BR>
local level work with the people at the local level, reflecting their 
<BR>
particular desires.  Let the regional government deal with the issues affecting
<BR>
the region, the nationalg overnment with issues of national scale, planetary
<BR>
governance dealing withthse broad, diffuse, truly global issues.  How we 
<BR>
arrive at these points I can't tell you - I can't even tell you what the 
<BR>
mechanics would look like.  i have my own ideas, but they are untested and
<BR>
unresearched.
<BR>
<P>But I ask this:  What form of governance that we have available to us today
<BR>
would be able to construct and maintain an arcology-style structure, and 
<BR>
accomplish it in a reasonable amount of time?
<BR>
<P>This political discussion is tiresome because no ones views will change, no 
<BR>
matter how stridently we defend our own positions.  Either the loud voices
<BR>
for libertarianism and the &quot;right&quot; will shout out an eventually exclude
<BR>
everyone who dissents (and have already linked the philosophy of extropianism
<BR>
with the political nature of libertarianism, though such linkages are anything 
<BR>
but assured), ro some sort o funderstanding needs to be arrived at where people
<BR>
will refrain from idle, unnecessary swipes at each other regarding political
<BR>
philosophy.  We obviously can't agree on this, and we waste much bandwidth and
<BR>
effort on a discussion no one can &quot;win&quot;.
<BR>
<P>My apologies for being so long-winded, and for adding my own little bit of 
<BR>
fuel to the political fires.  I am, as I do every election, hereby abdicating
<BR>
my political responsibilities until something better comes along.
<BR>
