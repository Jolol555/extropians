<EM>&gt; &gt; Capitalists have never:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a) operated concentration camps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about what was done to US citizens of Japanese ancestry during the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1940's?
</EM><BR>
<P>That was done by a government, not a corporation, and a government that was
<BR>
socialist in all but name.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; b) exterminated people they refused to do business with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about US aid to military in places such as San Salvador, Mexico,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Guatemala?
</EM><BR>
<P>governments, again...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; c) exterminated anyone who looked at or talked badly about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bosses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about unruly slaves?
</EM><BR>
<P>Context, dear. If slavery is constitutional (as it has been under many
<BR>
governments), they technically are not 'people'. Yeah, its splitting hairs as
<BR>
far as you and I are concerned, by today's standards, but not by those of the
<BR>
relevant era.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; d) waged war against people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; etc etc etc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about the USA/CSA war of the 1860's?  How about the &quot;war on drugs?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, governments, governments, governments.
<BR>
<P>Show me a corporation, businesses, etc who have done any of the above. The
<BR>
closest example of anything like that that you could possibly come up with were
<BR>
the coal mine/union conflicts of the late 1800's, where mine owners had to
<BR>
employ troops with gatling guns to protect their assets from being destroyed by
<BR>
union vandals. One other possibility is the Dole Banana uprising against the
<BR>
Hawaiian royalty when the kingdom was annexed by the US. As military actions go,
<BR>
that was relatively bloodless and painless.
<BR>
<P>You might try to claim companies like the Hudson's Bay Company, or the East
<BR>
India Company, but they, again, were not capitalists, but state sanctioned
<BR>
mercantilists with plenipotentiary police powers granted them by the monarch.
