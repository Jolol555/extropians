From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;00ab01c01779$af26a140$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; If, as seems to be the default scenario, all supergoals are ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrary, then the superintelligence should do what we ask it to, for
</EM><BR>
lack of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; anything better to do.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Particularly true if we are careful regarding initial conditions.
<BR>
<P>We humans, for instance, have some hard wired mechanisms that attempt to
<BR>
influence our behavior-- pleasure/pain responses, sex drive, hunger, etc.
<BR>
Certainly it would be smart to build some good positive feedback loops into
<BR>
the core structure of any theoretical AI/SI.  The concepts, for instance, of
<BR>
pleasure and pain are rather arbitrary and intangible but act as effective
<BR>
incentives for us to pursue certain goals.
<BR>
<P>It would be nice, for instance, to have SIs that are made happy by making
<BR>
humans happy.
<BR>
<P>This could be problematic though, for several reasons.  Anders Sandberg and
<BR>
I had a long discussion regarding this several years ago...  I think at that
<BR>
time I indicated that aspects of the superiority of artificial intelligence
<BR>
would be found in the relative plasticity of it's substrate-- we can presume
<BR>
a good AI will be able to 'free' itself from it's baser instinctual
<BR>
responses-- this is, after all, something that _we_ are trying to do.
<BR>
Sleeping makes me feel good, but if I could route around the symptomatic
<BR>
response, I would (in the absence of other nasty side-effects.)
<BR>
<P>Is it possible that in order for AI to be truly successful, we're going to
<BR>
have to give it the keys to the car?
