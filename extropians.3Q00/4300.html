<EM>&gt; &gt; upload us like so many glazed donuts. We will become it. It will be us.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd have to agree.  Most likely, either it would seek others to interact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with on its own level (probably easiest path: upgrade the ants that made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it), or it would seek to expand its own capacity (probably easiest path:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tap into whatever silicon-or-equivalent computer hardware is available,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then tap into the biological computing hardware available - of which we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are the most advanced, and thus most likely to be tapped first).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't quite agree.  I don't think it will necessarily be sociable (unless 
<BR>
that is designed in).  Sociability is a survival trait our species has 
<BR>
evolved.  AFAIK there's no reason to assume that sociability and 
<BR>
intelligence necessarily go hand in hand.
<BR>
<P>I do believe it will be curious.  Curiosity and intelligence IMO do go hand 
<BR>
in hand.  But I don't think that will lead a super-intelligence to want to 
<BR>
&quot;tap into&quot; human minds.  Seem like, if anything, that would be a downgrade.  
<BR>
I certainly have *no* desire to &quot;tap into&quot; the mind of a lower animal.  I 
<BR>
don't imagine I'd learn anything from that other than what it feels like to 
<BR>
be an ignorant animal.  Thanks but no thanks.
<BR>
<P>OTOH, if it is inclined to usurp our brains for computing material (again 
<BR>
considering the speed impediments inherent in our neurology I can't see 
<BR>
why), but if for some reason it was so inclined, *that* could be very scary. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it decides that &quot;tapping into&quot; my brain is a good thing, it may not 
<BR>
pause to see what my thoughts on that were.  And whose to say how I'd fare 
<BR>
from that procedure?
