<P>
Suppose we don't have a libertarian or private-law world as we move
<BR>
forward.  Can the modern liberal democracy work in a transhuman world?
<BR>
<P>How would we deal with the tremendous potential increase in diversity,
<BR>
with a corresponding spread in ability levels?  Some people will augment
<BR>
themselves to be super-intelligent and have other powers.  AIs may
<BR>
come into existence with beyond human capabilities.  How do those who
<BR>
cherish the equalizing efforts of western governments propose to address
<BR>
these changes?
<BR>
<P>Should such transformations be outlawed?  If equality is a guiding
<BR>
principle, is it fair that a wealthy man can make himself more
<BR>
intelligent, giving himself even further advantages?  Can we expect to tax
<BR>
away their gains if they become clever enough to evade the regulations?
<BR>
<P>And what if we see new forms of intelligent life?  Not every AI may be
<BR>
superhuman.  We might have enhanced systems everywhere we turn, up to the
<BR>
intelligent drains from Josh Storrs Hall's parody.  Which of these will
<BR>
be eligible for the dole?  How do we equalize the lot of a restaurant's
<BR>
automated purchasing agent and a strategic economic planning AI?
<BR>
<P>The modern view is that government can smooth the path of life and
<BR>
equalize some of the unfairness.  But it is hard to see how this can
<BR>
translate to the kind of world we envision.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone done any work on this problem?  Is this kind of thing
<BR>
discussed on the non-extropian transhumanist lists?  Extropians take
<BR>
quite a beating for their adherence to principles of non-coercion and
<BR>
voluntarism.  Do the redistributionists have a better plan for the future?
<BR>
