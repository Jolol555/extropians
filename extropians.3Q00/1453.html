<EM>&gt; Disconnect the box?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There will likely be (is?) a broadly statute proclaiming that any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unauthorised alteration or tampering,  disconnecting of the box is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; collusion, accessory to whatever &quot;crime&quot; they are investigating,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cyber-terrorism, conspiracy to cyber-terrorism, and obstruction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only qualified agents may alter or tamper with the box.. and there will be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long, expensive bureaucratic nightmare to accomplish this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Disconnecting ain't altering or tampering.  The box itself is still in
<BR>
mint condition; it just isn't interfering.  Or maybe the box gets a pair
<BR>
of splitter feeds, so that rather than being between the router and the
<BR>
rest of the ISP's boxes, it just gets a copy of the incoming and
<BR>
outgoing signals.  At which point, if it wants to block traffic, fine:
<BR>
it wasn't conducting traffic anyway.  It's still given full access to
<BR>
sniff; it just can't do anything about the signals on its own.
<BR>
<P>Or, if they do try to shut down the 'Net, how many minutes do you think
<BR>
it will take before Congress, acting on floods of outraged calls from
<BR>
wired Americans, starts calling for the heads of whoever authorized the
<BR>
deed?  (And quite possibly also a presidential pardon for anyone and
<BR>
everyone who thwarted the attempt, followed by a quick repeal of the law
<BR>
in question.)  Tarnished as they may be, there are still elements of
<BR>
democracy in the USA.
<BR>
<P>And let's not even get into the finger that most (not all, probably, but
<BR>
certainly most) non-USA governments would collectively give to any US
<BR>
gov't official who &quot;ordered&quot; them to do such a thing.  (There'd even be
<BR>
a small - *very* small, granted - chance that certain non-US governments
<BR>
might, if sufficiently tired of such requests, take this as an excuse to
<BR>
&quot;liberate the American people from their clueless and tyrranical
<BR>
government&quot;.)

<EM>&gt;   &gt; I just read this article by Robert X. Cringley:

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What an appropriate name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; Original Article: <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html</A>

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; But I have my own theory about Carnivore. From a network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; architecture standpoint, the best location for Carnivore is right after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; the ISP's router. This puts Carnivore in the path of every packet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; entering or leaving the ISP. It's also a major reason why ISPs might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; not want to install Carnivore boxes -- it's the network's point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; greatest vulnerability. In this position, Carnivore can act as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; listening and recording device, OR IT CAN ACT AS A SWITCH. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; we ever hear a proposal from the FBI in which it plans to install
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; Carnivores at all 6000 ISPs in the U.S., we'll be giving the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt; government the power to do something it can't do right now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;                    Shut the Internet down.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the approximately ten minutes it will take ISP owners to figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out what happened, and disconnect the box.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sheesh.
