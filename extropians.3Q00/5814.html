<P><EM> &gt; If we expect AIs to want to be friendly toward us, then we'll need to assure the

<EM> &gt; AIs that we've done all that's humanly (and inhumanly) possible to make their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lives the wonderfully pleasant experience that they know. IOW, we'll have to

<EM> &gt; keep the AIs happy, and let them know that we are responsible for their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; happiness. They'll love us for making them happy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sigh. You can only make them happy as long as they stay on equal
<BR>
footing with us. Very soon after they fall into positive autofeedback
<BR>
self-enhancement process, you cease to be that. They move on, we stay
<BR>
where we are.
<BR>
<P>You can't reciprocate to a god in any meaningful way. Tell me why a
<BR>
god should consider us anything else than a feature of the landscape?
