<EM>&gt; &gt; My IP address only tells *you* which server I'm logged into (unless I have a
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time.  So if I do something naughty, you can go to my ISP with (1) my IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; address and (2) the date and time of my naugty behavior, and they can track
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; me down and chastise me accordingly.

<EM>&gt; Ok, regarding dynamic ip's.  Then your typical ISP's IP number is fixed for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first three sequences:  123.345.132.xxx    where .xxx is the dynamic part unique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to each user logged into at the time???

<P>I dont' recall off the top of my head, but I do know that when you are
<BR>
using chat software, like MS Chat, and you bring up a list of all users
<BR>
on the chat server, there is usually a column for their IP addy.
<BR>
Anything that is not strictly a set of four numbers (###.###.###.###) is
<BR>
a dynamic IP addy. Now, people using high speed connections, like DSL,
<BR>
T-1, etc get static IP addys that are permanently theirs, and which you
<BR>
can run a trace route straight to when tracking down. Of course, I could
<BR>
be calling into my home system from anywhere, either over the net via an
<BR>
anonymizer, or via a dial up connection into my machine over normal
<BR>
phone lines. If I use the second type, I can still use dozens of PBX
<BR>
systems to skip my calls off of before it goes to my home system or ISP. 
<BR>
<P>What is a PBX? Its a commercial phone system, like at a doctor's or
<BR>
dentist's office (like Merlin). Doctors and dentists are especially
<BR>
vulnerable (as are lawyers and accountants) because they like to put as
<BR>
much of their personal expenses on office equipment as possible, so when
<BR>
they finish checking their office voicemail, they will press a key to
<BR>
get the PBX to hang up and give them a dial tone. THing is that the dial
<BR>
tone is on the PBX, not the persons local phone, so any long distance
<BR>
calls made in this manner are on the PBX billing, not the bill for the
<BR>
local phone (which is good if you are calling from a payphone or if your
<BR>
cellphone long distance rates are sky high). If you ever saw the movie
<BR>
&quot;Sneakers&quot;, where they bounced calls all over the country before trying
<BR>
to crack into a company system, this is how hackers use PBX systems to
<BR>
anonymize themselves, because it takes a dedicated tracer to track down
<BR>
someone who is doing this, and each leg of the chain gives you x amount
<BR>
of time before they trace the place that call is calling from. Call up
<BR>
one PBX, get a dial tone, call another PBX from there, get a dial tone,
<BR>
etc.. for as many legs as you thing are necessary for security.

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
