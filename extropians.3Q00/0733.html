<EM>&gt; So I figure they have already given this some thought, and since their PR

<EM>&gt; countermoves so far have been negligible (considering the bankroll they have

<EM>&gt; at their disposal), I think they must see the growing feeding frenzy in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media as too powerful to stop. Perhaps they fear being demonized and losing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even more. The media needs to bring eyeballs to the page/screen. It appears 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that GE is too easy a target to pass up.
</EM><BR>
<P>The media tend to mirror public perceptions, with a spin towards
<BR>
pessimism (&quot;bad news is good news&quot;).
<BR>
<P>The major problem with industrial GE is the same as with mature
<BR>
molecular nanotechnology; it relies on replicators. Replicators are
<BR>
intrinsically frightening because they force people to confront issues
<BR>
(like exponential growth) that most of us aren't educated to understand.
<BR>
You can hear lingering echoes of the 19th century germ hysteria in it
<BR>
as well -- and _that_ hysteria had a rational basis: back then, when the
<BR>
germ theory of sepsis was just getting established in the general culture,
<BR>
bacterial disease killed more people than heart disease or cancer.
<BR>
<P>(Note that I'm not trying to excuse anti-GM fear-mongering; rather, I'm
<BR>
trying to understand its roots as a first step towards deciding the best
<BR>
mechanism for fighting it. To combat a bad meme you _don't_ accuse its
<BR>
carriers of being hysterical, or deny their assertions -- people will just
<BR>
think you're covering up something nasty. Rather, you need to understand
<BR>
the low-level motivation behind it and dig the ground out from under their
<BR>
feet. The goal isn't to convert anti-GM activists, it's to convince the 
<BR>
much larger silent majority that the anti-GM activists are _wrong_.)
<BR>
<P>Note also that it helps to be aware of the real hazards of
<BR>
industrialization of GM technology. These include things like antibiotic
<BR>
resistance transfer between species -- which has actually happened. (The
<BR>
gene for one variety of penicillinase was tagged as a marker onto another
<BR>
couple of desired genes implanted into a crop plant; the idea was that
<BR>
if the gene complex was transferred to soil bacteria, it would show up
<BR>
by simply plating the bacteria on agar containing ampicillin. While this
<BR>
is indisputably a workable gene tracer, it strikes me that encouraging
<BR>
antibiotic resistance in the wild is a _bad_ thing. Newer techniques
<BR>
have rendered this one obsolete, but it's illustrative of what I'd
<BR>
characterise as the real risks of GM; procedures which are not in the public
<BR>
interest engaged in due to a lack of oversight and strategic vision.
<BR>
<P>The main reason for anti-GM hysteria in Europe is cross-over from general
<BR>
distrust of agrobusiness. In the past decade, the industrialisation of
<BR>
agriculture and food distribution in the EU has resulted in most consumers
<BR>
being a long supply chain away from the stuff that goes into a meal. When
<BR>
I was a child (thirty years ago), farmer's markets and greengrocers were
<BR>
the main sources of food (along with butchers for cuts of meat). Today,
<BR>
80% of food is sold via supermarkets, and a large proportion of it is
<BR>
pre-processed. This sort of cultural change, coupled with a highly
<BR>
competitive food industry that sometimes cuts corners -- including
<BR>
essential corners relating to food hygeine -- caused a general distrust
<BR>
in the community. The British BSE crisis massively aggravated this; in
<BR>
psychological terms it did for the food industry in Europe what Three
<BR>
Mile Island and Chernobyl did for the nuclear industry. (It served notice
<BR>
that the people working in the industry are fallible, and that lives
<BR>
depend on them.) 
<BR>
<P>GM foods just came along at precisely the wrong time; when consumer
<BR>
confidence in food safety was at its lowest ebb for decades. The question
<BR>
seems to me to be, therefore, how to (a) stop new scare stories gathering
<BR>
attention (where there's no substance behind the scare), and (b)  how to
<BR>
demonstrate the very real benefits of this new technology.
<BR>
<P>Like, the difference between an adequate diet and starvation for a billion
<BR>
or three people over the next couple of decades ...
