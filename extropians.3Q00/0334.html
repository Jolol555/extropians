Yes enrapture and awe of the esthetic environment, as you say, can induce 
<BR>
what some would call &quot;spiritual experience&quot;, consider the scent of fresh 
<BR>
baked bread =]
<BR>
<P>But in distinction I belive, for lack of better words... a metaphysical or 
<BR>
extra-dimensional reality, some kind of hyperspace, that is somehow 
<BR>
strangely effectual in this 3D world, I however do not buy into any canned 
<BR>
prefabricated explanations, as it could be literally incomprehensible, as 
<BR>
much as a fish in a fishbowl trying to understand a television.
<BR>
<P>I experience &quot;phenomena&quot;, sometimes with witnesses and corroborative 
<BR>
evidence, I seek understanding.

<BR>
<P><P>What is the difference between being &quot;spiritually&quot; inclined and just
<BR>
having a grand appreciation for your life and the reality you currently
<BR>
inhabit? Many people I've talked to often claim a sense of spirituality
<BR>
without belief in some higher Creator/Supreme Being. Upon probing, what
<BR>
I've found is simply that they appreciate the complexity and the beauty
<BR>
of their environment (internal and external) without reference to some
<BR>
all-powerful deity. So, my question would then be, why use the loaded
<BR>
term spiritual, when really, you mean simple appreciation for your
<BR>
circumstances (whatever you perceive/believe them to be)?

<EM> &gt; You might clarify this by explaining why you unnecessarily conjoin belief 
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM> &gt; a spiritual reality with a belief in god, as one could have a belief in a

<EM> &gt; spiritual reality without believing in god (I do)
