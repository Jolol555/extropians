<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recent Fourth Alcor Conference on Life Extension Technologies
<BR>
Dr. Greg Fahy presented current experimental results from the
<BR>
Hippocampal Slice Cryopreservation Project (HSCP) of which he is chief
<BR>
scientist and co-principal investigator. Now in its second year of
<BR>
operation, the HSCP is being conducted at a research institution
<BR>
associated with a major Southern California university by Yuri Pichugin
<BR>
as experimentalist, and is funded by the Institute for Neural
<BR>
Cryobiology (INC). Since that presentation, confirmation of those
<BR>
results and additional progress have been made.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following research milestones have now been reached:
<BR>
<P>1.	Stable and reproducible experimental procedures have been perfected
<BR>
for dissecting, handling &amp; maintaining rat hippocampal slices with
<BR>
minimal harm, for vitrification solution (VS) addition &amp; removal, for
<BR>
cooling, vitrification &amp; rewarming, and for assaying cellular viability.
<BR>
2.	Using a potassium/sodium ratio assay for cellular viability (cells
<BR>
need to actively maintain this ratio in order to stay alive), addition &amp;
<BR>
removal of the VS currently used in the HSCP yields viabilities in the
<BR>
range of about 50% of the viability of fresh, untreated control slices.
<BR>
Slices vitrified in this VS have shown no injury attributable to
<BR>
vitrification &amp; warming per se in two separate experiments, and the
<BR>
reproducible cellular viability of such vitrified hippocampal slices is
<BR>
now at 53% of untreated controls.  The primary challenge, then, is to
<BR>
reduce injury associated with the VS itself.
<BR>
3.	Work is about to begin with a new VS which has allowed 21st Century
<BR>
Medicine researchers to achieve 95% cellular viability after testing the
<BR>
VS on rabbit kidney slices.  In addition, work is continuing on methods
<BR>
of adding &amp; removing VS that may be less damaging.  Finally, it is
<BR>
possible that longer recovery times may further improve the ultimate
<BR>
viability of the slices.  All in all, prospects for further improvement
<BR>
appear excellent.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ultimate goal of the HSCP is perfected cryopreservation of brain
<BR>
hippocampal slices. This requires not only high cellular viability, but
<BR>
clear demonstration of functioning cellular interconnections. More
<BR>
details about this advanced global viability assay may be found at the
<BR>
INC website listed below.  Once high cellular viability is achieved
<BR>
(which now looks to be very realistic before the end of the year 2000),
<BR>
work will begin on that final clear demonstration.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many generous donors of well over $100,000.00 spent so far to
<BR>
support this project are to be commended for their judgment and
<BR>
foresight. However, more money is now needed if the HSCP is to continue
<BR>
its success and complete its original project goals, which now more than
<BR>
ever before appear to be fully attainable.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please consider donating money to support the continuation of this
<BR>
important work which in all likelihood will hasten the achievement of
<BR>
perfected, fully-reversible, long-term human cryopreservation.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INC is a registered California Public Benefit Corporation (501(c)(3) -
<BR>
charitable) and all donors receive an official receipt which may be used
<BR>
to reduce US and California taxable income.

<BR>
