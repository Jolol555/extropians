<P>
I have a psychologist friend who's into neurolinguistic programming (NLP),
<BR>
and a few years ago he encouraged me to take a practitioner's course, since
<BR>
I have an ongoing interest in improving my ability to communicate with other
<BR>
people.
<BR>
<P>It was a fascinating course--an &quot;Art of Manipulation&quot; kind of course, and
<BR>
one of the major areas of study was the way in which people store and access
<BR>
information.  If you ask a visually oriented person to recall this morning's
<BR>
breakfast, they'd likely get a picture in their mind of the table setting
<BR>
and the plate with food on it. An auditory person might recall the sound of
<BR>
ham frying and coffee making, and the sound of the words ham, eggs, and
<BR>
toast. The kinesthetically oriented person is supposed to be the least
<BR>
common.  The instructor was using the word in a broader sense than I would
<BR>
have.  I would have thought that kinesthesia had to do solely with movement,
<BR>
but the instructor used it to include sensations of touch in general, so
<BR>
that you'd say a person was using kinesthetic recall when they remember the
<BR>
feeling of chewing ham, and the texture of toast smeared with marmalade. I
<BR>
wondered why there was no mention of olfactory recall, as smell is supposed
<BR>
to be one of the most powerful elicitors of memories. Maybe it's a method of
<BR>
recall that's not commonly voluntary.  I myself find it difficult to
<BR>
consciously recall, for example, the exact smell of newly wet pavement,
<BR>
although I recognize it immediately upon smelling it.
<BR>
<P>Naturally, I turned out to be weird.  Although I had no trouble with visual
<BR>
or auditory recall (or projection either--I could imagine things which
<BR>
didn't exist in the real world, and see and hear them in my mind), I tended
<BR>
to use kinesthesia in strange ways, such as when working simple math
<BR>
problems. And it's a fact, though I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, that
<BR>
in adding and subtracting numbers, I count by moving my fingers.  For me,
<BR>
this is a simple extension of the way in which I listen to or play music, so
<BR>
I have my doubts as to whether it's all that unusual.  But although many
<BR>
people dance to music,  most people don't report doing math kinesthetically.
<BR>
<P>I guess because of my own weirdness, I was interested to read of Damien's
<BR>
inability to form visual images and his reliance on kinesthesia in doing IQ
<BR>
tests.
<BR>
<P>The question by which I'm obsessed today is this:  how does one's method of
<BR>
interfacing with the world affect (is this right, or is it supposed to be
<BR>
&quot;effect?&quot;) one's style of dreaming?  My dreams are almost always in
<BR>
brilliant color and include sound, smell, touch, taste--the whole works.
<BR>
Sometimes I have dreams that are like movies with complex plots--some of
<BR>
them take place on really interesting non-terran planets.
<BR>
<P>There is a corollary question:  how does one's method of interfacing with
<BR>
the world effect one's method of creating?  I use creating in this context
<BR>
to mean making something that didn't exist before you made it.
<BR>
<P>I wait eagerly hoping that others will be interested enough in this topic to
<BR>
shed further light on it.
<BR>
