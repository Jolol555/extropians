<EM>&gt; I have to break in on this topic with a reminder. Solar is something I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100% for, however, what will liberate solar and wind, or rather ignite it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be the conversion of photovoltaic and wind energy into fuel for fuel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells or perhaps, flywheels. Storage for evening or dark day times is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; key. All weather solar power and wind power are another issue. If we just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listen to the blathers about solar being merely a sunbelt energy, it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never take off. Fusion looks plausible, but directionless, and therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gut-shot.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, no. Sorry. The primary resistance to both solar and wind (outside of
<BR>
cost effectiveness) is NIMBY. Some people try to convince themselves that a
<BR>
hillside full of windmills is a beautiful thing, but all they do is demonstrate
<BR>
how foolish they are willing to be to perpetuate a meme. There are actually very
<BR>
few sites that are cost effective to place wind generators, and the percent wind
<BR>
contributes to the grid will always be in the single digits. Cheap low
<BR>
efficiency solar shingles will become popular in sunny climes. As its cost per
<BR>
kWh drops (i.e. as manufacturing base and output expands), use will migrate to
<BR>
less sunny climes. All weather solar power is not possible.
<BR>
<P>The solution to the daily variance in solar and wind power at any given point is
<BR>
of course to have  a worldwide grid of such generators. Thus far, there is no
<BR>
such grid. While North America is pretty will integrated electrically, as is
<BR>
Europe and asia and south america are getting there, tying all these together
<BR>
will be required to remove the problem of storage. Choke points for the grid
<BR>
will become prime brokers in the power industry: Panama, the Bering Straits,
<BR>
Sinai, Yemen, Gibraltar, and Indonesia.
<BR>
<P>Beyond this, while some call for Tesla's dream of radio transmission of power,
<BR>
such an idea runs smack dab into paranoia about EM radiation and NIMBY
<BR>
attitudes. Governments may try to institute it, but will run into widespread
<BR>
protest, greater than anti-nuke protests of the 80's, that will be well financed
<BR>
by industry.
<BR>
<P>How things will fall out is that by 2030 solar power sats will start getting
<BR>
built, and an orbital network of MASER power transmission systems will transport
<BR>
energy to key sites on each continent. Prime location for the power sats will be
<BR>
at the Sun-earth L2 point, where the sats will also act to reduce total flux
<BR>
reaching earth, thus helping to offset any global warming effects whether they
<BR>
be a result of pollution or Malenkovich Cycles.
<BR>
<P>Fossil fuels will continue to be used for transportation beyond this point, but
<BR>
not for static uses, although work will be done on using reverse fuel cells to
<BR>
produce natural gas from electricity. Hydrogen will NOT be the fuel of choice,
<BR>
due to its corrosive properties and low density.
