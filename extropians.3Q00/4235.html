<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i see no reason that an SI (the kind that eliezer envisions,
<BR>
anyway) would experience anything remotely as anthropomorphic as
<BR>
gratefulness. we are talking about an engineered transcendent mind, not
<BR>
a product of millions of years of evolution -- no parents, no siblings, no
<BR>
competition, no breast-feeding.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as eliezer points out in his various writings, if such a mind does
<BR>
anything at all, it would be because it was objectively _right_ -- not
<BR>
because it feels good, and not as a result of any coerced behavior (ie,
<BR>
evolutionary programming). thus, even if the SI is the best alternative
<BR>
for the human race, i would still approach it with fear and trembling.
