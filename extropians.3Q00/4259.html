Well, you have to remember that we are pretty funny, after all. All this
<BR>
rampant technophillia, belief in the Singularity, living forever through
<BR>
cybernetics/biotech/nanosanta, testosterone fantasies of becoming spaceborn
<BR>
battlepods, or starting floating communities at sea of the few and the free
<BR>
(and the highly dangerous). It's space cadet stuff.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I think Transhumanism, and Extropianism, is a beautiful bunch of
<BR>
somewhat shared visions. To be a technophile is to love what it really is to
<BR>
be human. I think the singularity probably is around the corner. I think
<BR>
life extension is laudable, will become practical, and will one day, in
<BR>
retrospect, seem as obvious as powered flight. I think the idea of munching
<BR>
Mars up for a zillion spaceborn bubble environments and spare parts is a
<BR>
very cool vision. Life on the high seas, hmm, maybe I could skip that one.
<BR>
<P>But we really need to take a step back and laugh at ourselves once in a
<BR>
while. See it from the outside. We have a credibility, I'd estimate, just
<BR>
slightly higher than the person who worked on Klingon for her PhD thesis,
<BR>
and maybe slightly below the Scientologists. We are fringe dwelling, grade A
<BR>
loony toons.
<BR>
<P>It's always like that with vision. One day, people will say &quot;what was so
<BR>
special about transhumanism?&quot; It'll seem obvious in retrospect. And we'll
<BR>
probably have trouble remembering what the big deal was too. But for now, we
<BR>
are freaks.
<BR>
<P>I'd say we're on the right track. As long as we can stave off dogma, and can
<BR>
keep taking in new information from the environment around us, we'll be a
<BR>
step ahead on future developments. We might be off track predicting 30 years
<BR>
into the future, and predictions that include everything up to and including
<BR>
the heat death of the universe, well, I'm skeptical. But I think we've got a
<BR>
halfway decent idea of the coming decade, and will continue to be able to
<BR>
see that far ahead with some clarity. We wont be too surprised by future
<BR>
developments. Some of us will make a lot of money. We'll be ahead of the
<BR>
game on grabbing the benefits of the really crazy new technologies, and thus
<BR>
some of us will have a good chance of controlling the directions these take.
<BR>
We might even see the singularity coming, if it does, just in time, if we
<BR>
are lucky and are still paying attention.
<BR>
<P>Cynicism is so late 20th century (I like to think I'm at least one year
<BR>
ahead of the game). Optimism is in, and we've got it in bucketloads. Be
<BR>
freaky, be proud, enjoy it while you can; tomorrow we might have to run the
<BR>
world.
