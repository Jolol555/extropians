<P>
Don't hit me! There might be something very weird and very interesting in
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P>I'd like some considered comments on this site and these instances of
<BR>
claims of paranormal perception achieved by a specific practical protocol
<BR>
(remote viewing), developed for the formerly classified STARGATE project. 
<BR>
<P>Free-floating condemnation from anyone who can't be bothered actually
<BR>
checking out the site for a quick look (by either conventional
<BR>
mouse-clicking or paranormal means, I don't care) will be taken *really
<BR>
really seriously*.
<BR>
<P>I've corresponded with Joe McMoneagle, and he seems an upright guy, well
<BR>
respected by the small scientific community involved in this rather fringe
<BR>
discipline. I am, however, aghast to find an `astrology' page on his site,
<BR>
but maybe that goes with the territory.
<BR>
<P>Here's an example of his claimed activities,
