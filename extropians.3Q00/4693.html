From: Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Homeless&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009111516.IAA11608@well.com&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The latest societal convulsion in the SF Bay area has created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some oddities.  During the bad old days of the late 80s, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had a great number of signers: these guys holding signs insisting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they would WORK for FOOD, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well, unfortunately for them, prosperity intervened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Clintonomics?) and even they must have recognized the absurdity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the notion, holding such a sign on the street corner, when all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the local fast food places had *permanently mounted* their HELP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;WANTED signs in the window.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bill Clinton has nothing to do with the current period of
<BR>
prosperity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Last year, the government issued a very large number of visas,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to pretty much anyone who could pay taxes on 60k, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just about the starting wage around here for anyone who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;place one line of code in front of another, so as one might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suspect we had a massive influx, which caused the apartment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vacancy rate to drop to a few parts per million, which caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the rent prices to skyrocket to the point that the &quot;homeless-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will-work-for-food&quot;ers were in danger of actually becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;literally without a home.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is an attempt to hold down the price of skilled workers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The will-work-for-fooders stand out there on the corner,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with all limbs in apparent working condition, while Burger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;King is *crying out* for someone willing to just push a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mop and wipe tables.  And they will hire *anyone* no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;questions asked, dog kickers, mass murderers, whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They hire the mentally retarded, but oddly enough, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arent enough of them either.  And the fast food gets steadily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slower, because there arent enough people working the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kitchen.  Meanwhile the floors and tables get ever dirtier.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've noticed that so called homeless deliberately avoid areas with
<BR>
&quot;Help Wanted&quot; posters nearby.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Engineering teams dissolve because the young PhDs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cannot afford the rent.  Those who argue that National
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Missile Defense is an impossible task never do site the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*real* most difficult hurdle facing it: keeping teams together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in areas that are too expensive for those working the project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For those who have managed to acquire a home, of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is like winning the lottery in slow motion.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So here in Silicon Valley we see a foretaste of a future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in which wealth is distributed ever more based on technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability and insight, steadily less on the number of hours worked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can see that what must happen here is that the techno-have-nots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must abandon the valley, being replaced in the short run by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commuters from the outlying areas, these being replaced in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the long run by androids.  All this looks great from the point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of view of a techno-have, but I can scarcely imagine the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anguish of the other half.  My solution is to not be one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them.  Other ideas?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>Chicago is becoming a haven for New York expats who are
<BR>
discovvering they can have a high quality urban life for half the
<BR>
cost.
