<EM>&gt;If the &quot;self&quot; and &quot;values&quot; are objective, then it's quite easy to see how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;their destruction can be real and not merely just a matter of arbitrarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;labeling things as such.  One need not swallow all of Rand's philosophy or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even all of her ethics to see this is so.  Anything which destroys one,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where one does so willingly is self-sacrifice, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also, Kant, e.g., in his _Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals_ tries 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;separate moral actions from pleasure.  Granted, this might be hard to do in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;practice, but his notion is that the good should be pursued regardless of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its consequences, especially regardless of pleasure and happiness.  That 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people practice this so sternly is perhaps because this view of morality is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so antithetical to living life it can hardly be consistently practiced.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Why?  Well, if one consistently practices it, one will have little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emotional feedback, one will be miserable, and, ultimately, to sacrifice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one's self means to get rid of one's self, which means to be no more, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;means to stop being an actor, moral or otherwise.)
</EM><BR>

<P>Rand must be turning in her grave for sure now - defended by a Kantian 
<BR>
argument!!!  As you probably know, she considered Kant to be thoroughly evil 
<BR>
and his philosophy utterly anti-human.  Nonetheless, with much trepedition 
<BR>
and foreboding in anticipation of wasted time, I have to say that yours is 
<BR>
the first post I've noticed on this thread that actually bears on the 
<BR>
fundamental issue raised - is there such a thing as actual selfishness?  Or 
<BR>
is it merely indistinguishable from &quot;intent.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Clearly, without a referent independent of the subjective intent of the 
<BR>
person, whatever the person chooses to do must be considered to be selfish.  
<BR>
If &quot;selfishness&quot; is to have content, it must be possible to be unselfish.  
<BR>
To say that selfish actions have as their intended benficiary the actor 
<BR>
himself merely puts the same logical obstacle one step further away in the 
<BR>
logical chain.  It is only when one poses an external referent - external to 
<BR>
the will - as the determining quality that selfishness becomes meaningful.
<BR>
<P>Rand herself gets into this line of argumentation in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; as I 
<BR>
recall, when one of the characters is admonished by one of the villians 
<BR>
against enjoying her good works.  If she enjoys it, then it wasn't truly 
<BR>
selfless after all, and she's just cheating.  Only if you act without 
<BR>
desire, without pleasure, without the anticipation of a desired outcome, can 
<BR>
you be truly &quot;selfless.&quot;  But are &quot;selfless&quot; and &quot;selfish&quot; opposites?
<BR>
<P>The next question, however, is: If selfishness is distinguished from 
<BR>
unselfishness by some objective criteria, then, nevertheless, what 
<BR>
difference could it possibly make?  Suppose I come up to you and say, &quot;Bad, 
<BR>
Daniel, bad, bad!  You weren't being selfish.  And I can prove it by 
<BR>
reference to 'The Objective Rules for Being Selfish,' vol. VI, Pg. 397.&quot;  
<BR>
And you agree!  How could you have done any differently if you always act in 
<BR>
every circumstance with the intent of achieving a better state?
<BR>
<P>Ah, but you do act differently with different knowledge...  The &quot;will&quot; does 
<BR>
not exist as a floating abstraction independent of input.  The only rational 
<BR>
critique I can make then is that on some level you were ignorant of what was 
<BR>
truly, really, objectively in your true, real, objective self-interest.  
<BR>
Rand's position, then, boils down to a rejection of any argument that starts 
<BR>
out postulating that one should act against one's self-interest, and then, 
<BR>
like Aristotle, laying out what constitutes, in principle, what objectively 
<BR>
is in your self-interest.  I.e., what are values, why they have that 
<BR>
characteristic, how to identify them in reality, how to rank them, what 
<BR>
methods and habits of behavior - virtues - are most likely to achieve a life 
<BR>
filled with real values.
<BR>
<P>If, as Rand argues, man - or any uploaded or SI progeny he may produce - has 
<BR>
a specific nature - like every other thing in the universe - then he needs 
<BR>
specific kinds of things to survive as the kind of being he is.  That 
<BR>
objective reality is the foundation for any discussion of objective value 
<BR>
and thus what really constitutes selfishness.
