<EM>&gt;The reason it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does not work on Mac, and why MS is likely not interested in investing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the money in developing a reader for the Mac, is that the current Mac OS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is a lame duck.
</EM><BR>
<P>You must not be aware that Microsoft has created a Macintosh 
<BR>
development group  specifically to develop for the Macintosh.  Their 
<BR>
latest software release was Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Mac.  It 
<BR>
has more features and is more HTML and CSS compliant than their 
<BR>
Windows version.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The next version of the Mac OS is going to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be linux based,
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite.  It is Unix based, but not all Unixes are Linux.  Macs can 
<BR>
already run a lot of different Unixes, including BSD Unix, AT&amp;T Unix, 
<BR>
Linux, NextOS, and Mach-10.  I know there are many other Unixes that 
<BR>
it can run, but these are the ones I have personally run on my Mac.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;will not run ANY current Mac applications,
</EM><BR>
<P>It will provide full backwards compatibility.  This means that it can 
<BR>
run all current Macintosh programs.  The developer versions are 
<BR>
already out and working, so this is not vaporware.
<BR>
<P>What you probably heard is that it does not provide *forward* 
<BR>
compatibility.  Current Mac users can't run the new Unix applications 
<BR>
unless they upgrade to the next OS release.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You Mac users will have to buy all new applications (isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this the third time that Apple has done this to you Mac users
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  My iMac runs programs that I have had since my Mac Plus over 15 
<BR>
years ago.  It wasn't even the same processor chip as my iMac, but 
<BR>
most of the programs still run.  Apple has always maintained 
<BR>
backwards compatibility.  When they switched to the PowerPC 
<BR>
processor, most users who upgraded didn't even realize that the 
<BR>
hardware was radically different.
<BR>
<P>I currently use my iMac to run these operating systems: MacOS, Mac X, 
<BR>
BSD Unix, AT&amp;T Unix, Linux, Mach-10, NextStep, DOS, Windows 3.1, 
<BR>
Windows 95, Windows NT, Windows 2000, OS/2, BeOS and AppleII.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;yet you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continue to complain about the *Microsoft* conspiracy/monopoly?).
</EM><BR>
<P>Some Mac users, but not me.  I prefer Microsoft Internet Explorer 
<BR>
because it just plain renders HTML and CSS better.  My last three 
<BR>
laptops have been IBM ThinkPads, with Microsoft Windows, IBM AIX, and 
<BR>
IBM OS/2 OSes.
<BR>
<P>As you can see, I use a dozen different operating systems in my 
<BR>
consulting business.  The idea that there is a single OS monopoly is 
<BR>
outrageous.
