<P>
I agree with Hal Finney's sensible remarks on this, but want to respond 
<BR>
regarding a few issues.
<BR>
<P>First of all, Paul, I can understand you being annoyed by Michael Lorrey's 
<BR>
harsh characterization of your discussion of the issue of &quot;bugs in free 
<BR>
markets&quot;. I implore everyone here to maintain a civil level of discourse, 
<BR>
no matter how frustrated you feel.
<BR>
<P>That said, I find your reaction, Paul, to be out of proportion. Clearly 
<BR>
something else is going on here, and Mike's comment just triggered it. As 
<BR>
Hal noted, several people had engaged you on this issue in a perfectly calm 
<BR>
and reasonable manner. Most of us have long gone beyond the stage of seeing 
<BR>
free markets as *necessarily* optimal, but based on vast amounts of 
<BR>
evidence we see the burden of proof on those who would &quot;improve&quot; the system 
<BR>
on the other side. (Personally, I see plenty of room for improvement in our 
<BR>
political system, and think some of your concerns about the weak being 
<BR>
taken advantage of would be relieved by introducing more competition into 
<BR>
schools. And, FWIW, I stopped referring to myself as a &quot;libertarian&quot; 
<BR>
several years ago.)

<EM>&gt;You should really listen to yourselves sometimes.  Ever wonder why the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who come across so called Extropian(TM) thinking run away?  More 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people I've come to know as true extropians have completely distanced 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from this movement which to them reeks of excessive dogmatism, irrationalism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hostility, name calling and online bullying.
</EM><BR>
<P>Paul, your comments here puzzle me. You yourself have just stated that you 
<BR>
strongly favor free markets. So do most of us here.
<BR>
<P>Your rhetorical question &quot; Ever wonder why the majority of people who come 
<BR>
across so called Extropian(TM) thinking run away?&quot; seems to express your 
<BR>
personal frustration. Of course extropian thinking is not for everyone. 
<BR>
That hardly makes it dogmatic. Yes, there have been some unpleasant 
<BR>
exchanges on this list, but they are generally milder and less frequent 
<BR>
that on many email lists. The recently reissued List Rules are designed to 
<BR>
further enforce civility.
<BR>
<P>Paul, you go on to mention some unspecified &quot;intelligentsia&quot; who have 
<BR>
written off Extropy Institute as a joke. I must say that, coming out of the 
<BR>
blue, this seems like a mean-spirited comment. If you genuinely were 
<BR>
concerned that this was a common response, you would have raised it with me 
<BR>
or ExI's directors or advisors. Instead, it *appears* to me that you are 
<BR>
throwing out a punch (not to me personally, but to the members of this 
<BR>
List). In fact, all your comments seem to be about the Extropians List, not 
<BR>
about Extropy Institute.
<BR>
<P>I would like to know who are these people who regard ExI (or just the 
<BR>
List?) as a joke and why. Simply saying such a thing in a public forum is 
<BR>
an insult. Explaining your experiences in a concerned and constructive 
<BR>
manner is entirely different. I'm always open to hearing feedback about 
<BR>
ExI, positive or negative. I can't help some people disliking us. We cannot 
<BR>
satisfy everyone and should not try to do so. But I'm sure we could do 
<BR>
better, and I'd like to hear honest feedback on this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Until I can see a more honest and non-hostile attitude that is willing to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free-market solutions to pressing issues such as DeCSS and basic civil 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;liberties,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm boycotting the institute and this list indefinitely.  This includes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;encouraging as many people as possible to avoid anything related to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Extropy(TM)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Institute as well as anyone else who advocates free market solutions that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the expense of individual liberty.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sorry to hear that and hope you will reconsider. I find your response 
<BR>
to be disproportionate. If you find the List discussions to be excessively 
<BR>
pro-free market, why reject everything else about the Institute--the Extro 
<BR>
conferences, the local lists and meetings, the website, extrodot.org, the 
<BR>
Extropian Principles (which nowhere demand acceptance of specific economic 
<BR>
or political systems), and our forthcoming knowledge management tool?
<BR>
<P>Onward!
