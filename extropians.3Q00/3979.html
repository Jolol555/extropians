<P><P>&quot;Best possible&quot; is open to interpretation.  Free markets offer maximum

<EM>&gt; the board. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The human issue with centralized planning is difficult to ignore.  For
<BR>
example, right now I am an economically efficient individual, generating
<BR>
plenty of value for both myself and those that I work for.  However, I
<BR>
have *chosen* to generate a relatively high economic value, and like most
<BR>
people, I have done so based on a cost/benefit analysis of the options. 
<BR>
The problem is that what I do to generate maximum economic value is not
<BR>
what I want to do; if the large benefit did not substantially
<BR>
outweigh the personal cost, I'd be doing something else entirely.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This is the crux of the matter: economic efficiency is essentially the
<BR>
delta between benefit and cost, the bigger the better.  Maximizing
<BR>
benefit has far more headroom than cost reduction for most people in
<BR>
relatively free markets.  As a result, people tend to select high benefit
<BR>
activities as they typically also offer the highest economic efficiency. 
<BR>
However, in a controlled market, where benefits are essentially compressed
<BR>
and given artificial ceilings and floors, economic efficiency can be
<BR>
better realized for the individual by choosing activities with the lowest
<BR>
personal cost.  For most people, activities with the lowest personal cost
<BR>
do not map well to activities that would be considered economically
<BR>
efficient in a free market.  As a result, the economy at large suffers. 
<BR>
Of course, the core problem is that the government cannot control all the
<BR>
variables (such as the highly subjective parameter of &quot;doing what you
<BR>
like&quot;), yet changing one affects the others.  If everyone actually
<BR>
preferred to do those things that offered the highest possible economic
<BR>
efficiency, then centrally controlled markets would work very well.
