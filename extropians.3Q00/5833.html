<P>Hmmm... sounds like you should be participating in some of de Garis' lab work.
<BR>
Incidentally (no flattery intended), why do you deprive Mind Children, Robo
<BR>
sapiens, Spiritual Machines, and Artilects of your expertise by spending time
<BR>
with us extro-slackers?

<P>--J. R.

<P>&quot;Even someone who believes that in the future most humans will become the slaves
<BR>
of all-powerful machines has to have a laugh sometimes. Why not have it with toy
<BR>
machines? Taking a moment off from his work at the cybernetics department at the
<BR>
University of Reading, Kevin Warwich, author of _March of the Machines: Why the
<BR>
New Race of Robots Will Rule the World_, plays with Lego Mindstorm robots that
<BR>
his students have programmed to box with each other.
<BR>
&quot;In his more serious work, Warwick is now trying to record his neural signals on
<BR>
a computer and replay them into his nervous system. In this way, he hopes, he
<BR>
will be able to drink a glass of wine on one day and the next day recapture the
<BR>
flavor with Proustian fidelity.&quot;
