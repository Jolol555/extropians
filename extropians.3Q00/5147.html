<P>The article's conclusion:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Using new technologies, revolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumptions can be tested. Admittedly, some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumptions discussed in this contribution are wild. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are testable with today's technology and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide great intellectual excitement. Moreover, they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very natural in the context of the debate about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existence or non-existence of state-vector collapses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a question which triggered animated discussions and disputes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since the very early times of quantum mechanics, 100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years ago.
</EM><BR>
<P>I personally don't find these experiments very interesting.  They always
<BR>
give the same result, which is that QM is true.  If they ever found
<BR>
this so-called &quot;real collapse&quot;, that would violate some of the basic
<BR>
principles of QM.  Granted, that would be an earthshaking result which
<BR>
would certainly be worth finding out, but the chances of it being true
<BR>
seem very small at this point.
<BR>
<P>I class these experiments with those looking for antigravity or violations
<BR>
of relativity.  I guess someone's got to do it, but it's tiresome,
<BR>
unrewarding work to keep accepting the null hypothesis.
<BR>
