Hal,
<BR>
<P>I understand this. But the usual expectations of quantum orthodoxy are not
<BR>
what I'm speaking about.
<BR>
<P>In this mysticism thing, I'm referring to the ideas of people who see modern
<BR>
QM as a degenerate form of a wider case. Who see room for the empirical
<BR>
validation of mysticism &amp; spiritism in physics already hinted at by the
<BR>
developments in quantum &amp; computational science of the first half of the
<BR>
20th century.
<BR>
<P>If quantum computations arise out of a much bigger set than the continuum...
<BR>
(eg., in a many worlds situation - if the manifold was
<BR>
(uncharacteristically) also propagated for each one of the superpositions
<BR>
as, I think, the physics maverick Roger Gouin pointed out...), then it may
<BR>
be possible to do wierd things.
<BR>
<P>Check my wording that you quote below... I'm not asserting things about
<BR>
classical quantum machines, cool as they admittedly are; I'm suggesting
<BR>
things about quantum weirdness that might arise if we continue the trail in
<BR>
the 21st century  - following the spirit of the formulations done in the
<BR>
20th century... and what we might find when we go and actually build mature
<BR>
quantum computers.
<BR>
<P>If quantum computations arise, not in this physical manifold but, beyond...
<BR>
in some set much larger than that amenable to our current mathematical
<BR>
analysis, then this might show up in the things that I mentioned.
<BR>
<P>Certainly the trail is suggestive - the QWF is deterministic to a flaw; yet
<BR>
the stupid Born criterion isn't... I smell a rat there!
<BR>
<P>The nice thing about all this is that it's empirically testable - and we can
<BR>
actually start doing real experiments shortly ( 3 - 10 years); as the
<BR>
quantum computer technology becomes available.
<BR>
<P>Actually... hmmm... one is available - it's quite degenerate. A tunnel
<BR>
diode. You can look at it as a quantum computer that outputs a random stream
<BR>
of numbers. If it doesn't - you'd better ask why.
<BR>
***************************
<BR>
<P>As for the very last part of your letter, remember the poor Turing machine
<BR>
runs on some serious limitations, it's crummy tape is denumerable and not
<BR>
even dense. Ugh!
<BR>
<P>So it's quite possible that quantum systems of the types we're positing are
<BR>
not computationally isomorphic with an infinite Tiring (...er, Turing...)
<BR>
machine. From that you might beable to swing a deterministic yet
<BR>
'noncomputable' universe.

<EM>&gt;&gt; But once we develop quantum computers we'll probably find out: not only

will

<EM>&gt;&gt; they handle exponential problems in polynomial time - but they'll
</EM><BR>
probably
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; (in these weird scenarios) solve Turing Incomputable problems in
</EM><BR>
polynomial
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; time - or even flat time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Actually, no, quantum computers are not expected to solve exponential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems in polynomial time.  More precisely, there are no problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;known to be exponential on classical computers which are polynomial on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quantum computers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Quantum computers can cut the exponent down on search problems, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are known to be exponential on both kinds of computers.  The speedup
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is potentially even greater on some special math problems (factoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for example) but the true complexity of those problems on convential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;computers is not known.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Quantum computers are not at all expected to solve Turing uncomputable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems like the halting problem.  From what I understand, they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subject to the same proofs of uncomputability.
