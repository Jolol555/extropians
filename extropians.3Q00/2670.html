<EM>&gt; Does Quantum Nonlocality Exist? Bell's Theorem and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many-Worlds Interpretation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Authors: Frank J. Tipler
</EM><BR>
<P>It's been known for a long time that Bell's Theorem does not apply
<BR>
to the MWI in terms of showing nonlocality.  Tipler refers to a paper
<BR>
from 1982 which makes that point.
<BR>
<P>The basic idea of Tipler's analysis echoes Mike Price's Many-Worlds
<BR>
FAQ, Q32, &quot;What about Bell's inequality?&quot;  See for example at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/documents/many-worlds-faq.html">http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/documents/many-worlds-faq.html</A>.
<BR>
Mike follows the same reasoning, looking at the experiment in terms
<BR>
of three local measurements, and counting the splits.  Tipler does
<BR>
go into more detail with the math, though.
<BR>
<P>Mike's conclusion:
<BR>
<P>: So where did Bell and Eberhard go wrong?  They thought that all theories
<BR>
: that reproduced the standard predictions must be non-local.  It has been
<BR>
: pointed out by both Albert [A] and Cramer [C] (who both support
<BR>
: different interpretations of QM) that Bell and Eberhard had implicity
<BR>
: assumed that every possible measurement - even if not performed - would
<BR>
: have yielded a *single* definite result.  This assumption is called
<BR>
: contra-factual definiteness or CFD [S].  What Bell and Eberhard really
<BR>
: proved was that every quantum theory must either violate locality *or*
<BR>
: CFD.  Many-worlds with its multiplicity of results in different worlds
<BR>
: violates CFD, of course, and thus can be local.
<BR>
<P>Tipler's result is not fundamentally new at all, although as I said he
<BR>
does work out some of the math in more detail.
<BR>
<P>One comment from Tipler struck me as odd:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; it is a presupposition of the MWI that only coefficients with rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; squares are allowed since irrational squares would imply an irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of worlds
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Tipler meant an &quot;infinite number of worlds&quot;, since he is
<BR>
apparently thinking that the coefficient squares represent ratios of
<BR>
worlds, and irrationals could only be considered as ratios of infinite
<BR>
values.
<BR>
<P>Of course the conventional mathematical formalism for QM does allow for
<BR>
arbitrary irrational (in fact, complex) coordinates.  If the MWI really
<BR>
exerted this restriction then it would be more than an interpretation.
<BR>
For example, given a vertically polarized photon, to express its state
<BR>
in a basis tilted at angle alpha involves cos(alpha) and sin(alpha) as
<BR>
coordinates.  Apparently with the MWI we need to define new functions
<BR>
that are like sin and cos but which always have rational outputs?
<BR>
I don't think so.
