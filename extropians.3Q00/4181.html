<EM>&gt; &gt; Let us say that I look at an orange pen.  There a few claims that I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to make about that orangeness, and each claim can be rated by degree of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; certainty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1.)  The pen is orange.  (appeal to the reality of existence)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This is a problematic statement for deeper reasons I've already given,
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; let's simply deal with the basics: perhaps a light source is altering
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; appearance of the pen, perhaps it's virtual reality, or perhaps a piece
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; orange gel has been placed between me and the pen.  In any case I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have absolute certainty regarding such a statement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What degree of certainty can you ascribe to it?  Note, all the examples
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; use to cast doubt on this example are sensory.  Knowledge of them -- your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons to doubt -- comes from the senses.  One, e.g., finds out about an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orange filter (my example originally:) by knowing about such filters.  How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does one know about them?  Generally, one sees them.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm... I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  It doesn't matter the
<BR>
means by which doubt is cast.  The point is simply that I cannot have
<BR>
absolute certainty in the above statement.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 2.)  I see the color orange.  (appeal to the reality of the senses)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This has much greater certainty.  You can't say to me: &quot;Aha, no, the pen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really blue!  I was just bouncing orange light off of it!&quot; because I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; claiming that the pen was orange, I was claiming that I perceived the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; color
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; orange.  This statement is -almost- 100% absolutely true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where do you derive the number 100 from?  (My pet peeve: putting numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alongside things to make yourself and others think you have more knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than you do.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?
<BR>
<P>Do you believe that I am using the term 100% to represent that I have
<BR>
greater knowledge regarding this scenario?  If so, let me put your mind at
<BR>
ease-- I am merely using it as (unnecessary) emphasis.  I will refrain in
<BR>
the future if you wish.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; How do you distinguish between hallucinations and perceptions?  Generally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are lots of ways to tell between the two, including consistency and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; context.  (If there was no way to tell, then, I submit, no one would ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come up with a concept of &quot;hallucination.&quot;  We would just assume they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly.  I accept this difference, thus the third example.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; It is possible to have absolute, 100% certainty regarding the realm of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree here.  The &quot;realm of the mind&quot; is no less prone to error.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be easily shown.  E.g., errors of reasoning and logic.  E.g., false
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memories.  E.g., imagining with whatever degree of realism things that
</EM><BR>
don't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; exist, such as unicorns or characters in a novel.  If you are willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disregard the evidence of the senses (to allude again to David Kelley's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; book), then the evidence of other parts of the mind should not get a free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pass.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, I should have been more clear.  I'm actually referring to a specific
<BR>
process of the mind (which I thought I was making clear in context here.)
<BR>
Your 'disagreement' above actually makes my point-- you're talking about
<BR>
ways in which the mind can be shown to be wrong in the context of an
<BR>
external reality.  One can make definitive statements regarding mental
<BR>
processes which have absolute authority in context.  As I've already pointed
<BR>
out, these definitive statements are necessarily separate from an external
<BR>
reality.  I can say &quot;I'm imagining a unicorn,&quot; and be absolutely correct.
<BR>
<P>You see Daniel, this is why I didn't really want to wade into the
<BR>
conversation-- there's so much work required just to make clear what it is
<BR>
precisely that I'm talking about-- and apparently I'm not doing a very good
<BR>
job of it.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hallucinating, if it was virtual reality, if the image was placed there
</EM><BR>
by
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aliens from another planet, you are still 100% correct to state that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experienced a particular brain state.  Currently this is the only realm
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which we are able to make absolute statements of reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would caution using &quot;brain state.&quot;  If you're going to discount the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence of the senses, remember, knowledge of &quot;brain states&quot; comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensory evidence.  In fact, the notion that the brain is intimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connected with mental activity is one based on a long chain of sense data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and abstraction from it.  X-rays, PET and CAT scans, experiments with
</EM><BR>
brain
<BR>
<EM>&gt; damaged animals (human or no) all come to us as sense data.  Even reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this, you must rely on your eyes.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is absolutely true.  The realm I am talking about is necessarily
<BR>
subjective, and this creates real problems for the objective reality crew.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I -do- believe in the mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is your evidence for the existence of the mind?
</EM><BR>
<P>Very good question.  Descartes, of course, thought it was sufficient merely
<BR>
to be able to ask the question-- a perfect bootstrap-- what can question the
<BR>
existence of the mind if not the mind itself?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I link the reality of my mind functionally to my external environment--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; way I don't bump into sharp objects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are skeptical about sense perception, then how do you know sharp
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; objects exist?
</EM><BR>
<P>As I've been saying, I don't require absolute certainty to proceed.  I
<BR>
merely admit the possibility that my senses are incorrect.
<BR>
<P>I'll quote myself, to re-iterate the point:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Essentially I have complete functional acceptance of the construct of
<BR>
reality, but maintain mental skepticism.  Currently this has no impact on my
<BR>
life other than to make for interesting discussion.  Despite what you were
<BR>
hinting at earlier, this doesn't result in me swerving out in traffic.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, the mere fact that there is a possibility that I can be incorrect
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the first two statements doesn't mean that I am.  I'm simply recognizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that there is a possibility-- and that these are not absolute reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; states.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a point I bring up in my dialogue.  The possibility for error does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not mean one is in error.  However, you seem to hold sense perception to
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; standard of being corrigible because of such possibilities, while ignoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that sense perception is not the only place the mind might err.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope I've successfully addressed this above.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And this sword cuts both ways: Having absolute certainty regarding a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; state does not always translate into something useful in the external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here you hint, again, that somehow external reality matters.  I think it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does, but I come from the Aristotelean-Objectivist tradition, which does
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; deny sense perception.  In fact, I see sense perception as the
</EM><BR>
foundation --
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in fact, the only possible foundation -- for knowledge.  However, if sense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perception is flawed and flawed in the way you hint -- which leads,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ultimately, to skepticism -- then no statements about external reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should matter.  After all, its very existence, by your reckoning, is
</EM><BR>
called
<BR>
<EM>&gt; into question.  Ergo, arguments about mental states being useful or about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them helping one to survive or even about the evolution of mind are thrown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similarly into doubt.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  Again, I am comfortable proceeding in the face of ambiguity.  Since I
<BR>
don't hold to an absolute view of reality, it makes perfect sense for there
<BR>
to be existence in the face of doubt.
<BR>
<P>Damn it Daniel, ya got me talking about this again!  :)
<BR>
<P><P>I'm going to try a little thought example, try this on for size:
<BR>
<P>We have two boxes: A) existence, and B) the mind.
<BR>
<P>Imagine if you will, an arrow in motion from A to B.  This is an arrow of
<BR>
increasing certainty (I'm basing this on previous arguments that you appear
<BR>
to have objections to, but let us proceed in any case:)  The arrow passes
<BR>
through a sensory state and delivers information to its destination, B, the
<BR>
mind.  The arrow is possessed of the property of absolute certainty only
<BR>
once it has reached its destination, but the nature of that certainty has
<BR>
been in a state of change.  Having certainty that there is an image of an
<BR>
orange pen in your mind does not directly translate back into the object you
<BR>
are looking at.
<BR>
<P>To restate: as that little arrow moves from A to B its degree of certainty
<BR>
approaches 100%, while simultaneously the subject of that certainty becomes
<BR>
altered.  In fact, the subject of that certainty has less and less to do
<BR>
with A and more and more to do with B.  This means that you're attaining
<BR>
certainty over something that doesn't exist in the world of A.
<BR>
<P>B, after all, is where certainty exists.  (Certainty = the mind knowing
<BR>
something)
<BR>
<P>There is a reverse arrow to the arrow of certainty.  I'm going to call it
<BR>
the arrow of functionality.  This arrow moves from B to A and as it moves,
<BR>
its degree of functionality increases.
<BR>
<P>A, after all, is where functionality exists.  (Functionality = something
<BR>
happening in existence)
<BR>
<P>Essentially, existence sends signals to my mind,  where they increase in
<BR>
certainty, but decrease in functionality, and in reverse, my mind sends
<BR>
signals to existence (taking action) that decrease in certainty (did I
<BR>
really pick up the pen, or was it VR?) but increase in functionality
<BR>
(something actually changes in the external world.)
<BR>
<P>Notice, however, in this model, you do not get absolute functionality and
<BR>
absolute certainty at the same time.  This is the model of reality that I am
<BR>
challenging-- that there is a real real world and we can be certain of it
<BR>
and it 'works,' both at the same time.  Instead I see reality as an arrow,
<BR>
pointing at the mind.
<BR>
<P>Many arrows in fact-- perhaps, if you'd like, in our universe, many arrows
<BR>
pointing from the same A, to different Bs.  The certainty of that reality
<BR>
lives in the Bs (and so there are many realities,) but the source of those
<BR>
realities lives in A (and so there is one reality.)  The Bs communicate
<BR>
action back to A and have a common realm into which they all interface.
<BR>
<P>I probably haven't done a very good job of describing this, so I've probably
<BR>
lost you already, but I just don't have the time to apply greater rigor to
<BR>
this.  Argh.
<BR>
<P><P>If you have followed me this far, however, I'd like to add a wrinkle:
<BR>
<P>There's doesn't really need to be an A to make this model work.
<BR>
<P>All you need are the arrows.
<BR>
<P><P>Consider, for instance, the possibility that 'reality' is just mind.  It's
<BR>
simpler actually.  If I want to build a world for a computer mind to
<BR>
inhabit, why bother to create the physical universe?
<BR>
<P>Yes, but what is the software running on?  (Again, an appeal to a physical
<BR>
universe-- throw it out for a minute!)
<BR>
<P><P>Okay, I'm going to stop this 'insanity' here-- people seem to get mad when I
<BR>
suggest there's actual rational thought behind this.
<BR>
<P>I don't suppose you live in the Greater Vancouver area?  This is definitely
<BR>
a sit down conversation.  It's easier to convince people I'm not a total
<BR>
lunatic in person.
<BR>
<P>Mm, no, scratch that, that's clearly not the case, otherwise my friends
<BR>
wouldn't look at me so weird.
<BR>
<P><P>I think you're probably going to say lots of good things that refute the
<BR>
above, but I really -really- have to stop talking about this now.
<BR>
<P><P>Thanks.
<BR>
<P><P>(You have a second post in which you make lots of good comments that
<BR>
generally lead me to believe that we disagree less than we think we do.
<BR>
That is to say-- in some cases the flaws you point out in my arguments
<BR>
generally have more to do with the way in which I have phrased them and less
<BR>
to do with the actual idea that I'm pointing at.)
