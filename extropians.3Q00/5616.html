<EM>&gt; &gt;To carry a lethal weapon, as others have pointed out, means adjusting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;your thought processes to the point where you are prepared to exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lethal force.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't see the necessity of that relation.  One might be quite willing to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carry a lethal weapon and yet be quite unwilling to use it.  By far the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of defensive uses of firearms involve mere brandishing them.  It 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffices to give the impression that you can and will use deadly force.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that carrying a weapon without intent to use it (such as carrying
<BR>
an unloaded weapon) does not raise the moral issues I was concerned about.
<BR>
If you have no intention of taking another life in response to robbery or
<BR>
rape then you are not in danger of depersonalizing criminals.  There are
<BR>
some practical dangers in brandishing a weapon without being prepared
<BR>
to use it, but I suspect that Tom is right, and most of the time this
<BR>
would be an effective strategy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;impersonal and hard-hearted? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To the contrary, I would argue that a person unwilling to conceive of using 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deadly force in defense of self and loved ones lacks both self-regard and a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; callous attitude toward the very people who most deserve protection.  Imagine 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a father who says, &quot;Oh, my, no!  I would not shoot someone even if it were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the only way to stop them from raping my wife and killing my children!  That 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be so, so . . . cruel!&quot;  I think we would rightly regard that fellow as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not just a coward but as morally culpable for failing to shoulder his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsibilities.  Would he nonetheless seem admirably warm-blooded, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal, and soft-hearted to Hal?  If so, I aver that one can take such 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traits, however virtuous in moderation, to unvirtuous extremes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would not view such a person with condemnation.  There are those,
<BR>
Quakers and such, who have taken a vow of non-violence and would not
<BR>
apply lethal force even against such provocation as Tom describes.
<BR>
These are peaceful people and I would hesitate to call them unvirtuous
<BR>
because they will not kill.
<BR>
<P>It's important to keep in mind that the chances of actually facing
<BR>
such a situation are minute in the extreme.  Most of the cases I was
<BR>
describing were the far more common (but still rare) situations of
<BR>
ordinary violence.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, given the uncertainties arising in a crisis, it seems
<BR>
unlikely that you can wait to pull your gun until you have determined
<BR>
that a violent situation is about to escalate to a lethal level, where
<BR>
your children are about to be killed (it's questionable whether killing
<BR>
would be justified in order to prevent rape).  This means that you have
<BR>
to threaten to kill at an earlier point in the interaction.  And most
<BR>
other commentators seem to agree that you should take threaten to kill
<BR>
only if you are convinced that killing would be justified.
<BR>
<P>On this basis I think the real issue is not whether one would kill in
<BR>
response to the worst possible lethal threat imaginable, but whether one
<BR>
is prepared to take a life in response to a lower level of violent attack.
