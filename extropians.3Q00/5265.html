<EM>&gt; &gt; What is being ignored? The fact is that the people who create stuff need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; live. The inscentive of wealth is ONE tool that is useful to to encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; creativeness. Historical analysis suggests that to date, it seems to be one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the most effective tools to do so. So the better question is: Do we need the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; current or higher levels of creativity, or can we survive in societies of lesser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; creativity before we engulf the planet? I say we need as high a level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; creativity as possible. It is understood, that at some point, there are only so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; many boats and cars you can park in your garage to make you happy, however a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; creative person can ALWAYS, I think, find something new and better to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more wealth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is being ignored is that to date we have been living largely in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scarcity.  As our tech advances rapidly toward singularity we live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comparative abundance.  It literally takes less and less human labor to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce most of our needs and many of our wants.
</EM><BR>
<P>Less labor, but more capital. Every new generation of computer chip from Intel,
<BR>
AMD, etc requires twice the capital of the previous to develop and build the
<BR>
plants to manufacture. While operational costs of manufacture drop due to
<BR>
automation, there is still front loading costs of capitalization which need to
<BR>
be paid for.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, in the case of Napster, I think we need to ask whether it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense to accuse people who simply use the internet to share music that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they would share with friends anyway to be actual &quot;pirates&quot; in any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaningful sense.  It also has been pointed out that most muscicians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never get rich at all from their work no matter how well received it is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The lion's share of most music revenues goes to the recording industry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In this day and age of nearly instant global communication most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recording industry's advertising and distribution costs are simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; archaic and highly overpriced overhead.
</EM><BR>
<P>Music companies spend many millions of dollars not only recording and producing
<BR>
the musician's CDs, but in generating the media hype with advertising and other
<BR>
marketing expenditures. That is tantamount to venture capitalists backing a
<BR>
high-tech startup. They need to be paid back for their investment. Idiot
<BR>
musicians like Courtney Love bitch about musicians being 'raped' by the music
<BR>
companies, but the music companies deal with 9 of ten bands they sign breaking
<BR>
up or failing long before the money invested in them is paid back. They have to
<BR>
deal with covering up the damages and rude behavior of spoiled brat musicians
<BR>
who get rock star head cases as soon as their first single hits the top 40,
<BR>
bailing them out of jail, and paying for the extravagant stage shows the
<BR>
musicians want to put on, where the musicians are too stupid to realize that all
<BR>
the money they are blowing is coming out of their own pockets, one way or
<BR>
another.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The dumbest thing to me about Napster is that the recording industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't embrace the idea as free advertising and take it a step further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by offering custom CDs containing your favorite music as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anywhere availability of your music and perhaps per play micro-charges.
</EM><BR>
<P>If what you say is true, they could easily have used the CD-Card format (the
<BR>
size of a credit card) for this purpose. They did not. Giving away digital
<BR>
quality music for the price of FM quality music (radio transmissions) is a
<BR>
really really really DUMB idea from both the point of the artist and the music
<BR>
company. Justifying the looter mentality with the claim that you'd never have
<BR>
been a looter if they had just given it to you for free is a bullshit cop out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, artists deserve to make a living.  But it doesn't require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protecting an outmoded way of publishing and distribution to take care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of that.  Most artists do not create to get rich.  They create because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they love to create.
</EM><BR>
<P>Most artists I know do have that as their prime motivation. They would also love
<BR>
to be able to create art for a living, rather than having to keep some schmuck
<BR>
job to pay their bills.
