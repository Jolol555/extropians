<P><EM>&gt;Per the Australian government:  ~150k out of 20M people are currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;classified as homeless by the Australian government.  Note that this is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worse than it used to be; the number of homeless were marked at about half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that number a decade earlier. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I wondered about definitions. Here's some interesting material on that, at
<BR>
an insane url:

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A landmark research report released today by the Australian Bureau of
</EM><BR>
Statistics estimates that on 6 August
<BR>
<EM>&gt;1996 there were 105,304 homeless people in Australia.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The report by Dr. Chris Chamberlain, Head of Sociology at Monash
</EM><BR>
University, analysed data from the 1996
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Census, from Supported Accommodation Assistance Programs (SAAP) throughout
</EM><BR>
Australia and academic
<BR>
<EM>&gt;research. 
</EM><BR>
<P>...&gt;The definition of homelessness used in the study goes beyond those
<BR>
people without a roof of any sort. Of those
<BR>
<EM>&gt;defined as homeless on census night, nearly half (48,500) were staying
</EM><BR>
temporarily with other households;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;one-fifth (20,600) were in improvised dwellings, tents or sleeping out.
</EM><BR>
Another 22 per cent (23,300) were staying
<BR>
<EM>&gt;in boarding houses on either a short-term or long-term basis. Finally
</EM><BR>
another 12 per cent (12,900) were staying
<BR>
<EM>&gt;in accommodation funded under the SAAP, such as hostels, refuges, night
</EM><BR>
shelters and other types of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;emergency accommodation.
</EM><BR>
<P>...
<BR>
The situation in individual States and Territories was as follows:
<BR>
<P>NSW	 29,608 
<BR>
VIC 	17,840  
<BR>
SA 	6,837 
<BR>
TAS 	2,014  
<BR>
WA 	12,252  
<BR>
Qld 	25,649 
<BR>
NT 	9,900 
<BR>
ACT 	1,200 
<BR>
<P>This is quite revealing. The two populous States with big cities are NSW
<BR>
and VIC, yet sparsely settled WA and Qld have nearly as many `homeless'. I
<BR>
suspect this is because those are the States with the largest number of
<BR>
aborigines living in some approximation of their traditional lifestyle -
<BR>
much more unhappily, of course, since they don't go hunting and gathering,
<BR>
but neither do they much like living in western houses, even when these are
<BR>
provided. Queensland is also a benign place to hang out if you're young, on
<BR>
the dole, doing some weed, surfing on the glorious beaches... and therefore
<BR>
homeless. Not quite what I had in mind.
<BR>
<P>Two other considerations: I wonder if some of what would notmally be the
<BR>
`homeless' in the USA are disguised as part of the immense jail population
<BR>
which seems to be replacing dismantled social service and mental
<BR>
institutions - 2 megahumans - 25% of the global prison population,
<BR>
according to one site, which notes:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;About 1.3 million of the current jail population have been imprisoned for
</EM><BR>
non-violent crimes, usually drug offences.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The annual bill for their incarceration is almost $26bn - about 50% more
</EM><BR>
than the government's entire spending
<BR>
<EM>&gt;on welfare and social security programmes. 
</EM><BR>
<P>And the rise in homeless in Oz has been attributed to the conservative
<BR>
govt's growing crackdown on dole benefits, and closures of services.
