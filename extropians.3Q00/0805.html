<EM>&gt; What does the list think of Napster? Is ethical or non-ethical? Do you use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ethics is a really personal, varying thing. I can tackle this from the point
<BR>
of view of practicality.
<BR>
<P>1. IP laws were brought into existance on the assumption that society needed
<BR>
them as an incentive for progress.
<BR>
<P>2. IP laws used to be enforceable, when copying equipment was bulky and
<BR>
expensive. Anybody who bought enough equipment to make a serious dent
<BR>
in the royalties would a) get noticed and b) would lose a lot of investment
<BR>
when the Feds came to kick down their door.
<BR>
<P>Today
<BR>
<P>1. A number of factors, including the increasing acceptance of
<BR>
anti-authoritarian ideologies (like ours) a healthy economy, and
<BR>
improved communications have made a 'gift economy' possible as
<BR>
described by ESR. Suddenly, there is a much more complex system of
<BR>
incentive for creating software and other intellectual work.  These
<BR>
incentives persist regardless of whether an author stands to collect
<BR>
royalties. Indeed, royalties create an irritating (but circumventable
<BR>
through reverse engineering) source of friction in the open development
<BR>
process.
<BR>
<P>2. A law that cannot be enforced is not much of a law, and is not long
<BR>
for this world. When all you need is a $1500 computer with a cable
<BR>
modem and a copy of Napster (or better yet, GNUtella) to commit
<BR>
'copyright infringement' on a monumental scale... when you can upload
<BR>
and download thousands of supposed dollars worth of 'intellectual
<BR>
property' in one evening... and maybe 0.1% of the time you'll get
<BR>
caught... and even if you are, they'll have a hard time making it stick
<BR>
if you wipe your drive and play dumb.
<BR>
<P>2A. Correction, IP can be enforced, but at severe cost to our digital
<BR>
freedom and privacy. If ISP's are required to sniff your packets, if
<BR>
your computer use gets logged and escrowed, if you are prohibited from
<BR>
being anonymous and from using crypto... perhaps then the fiction of 
<BR>
intellectual property will continue for a while. I don't know if the
<BR>
voters of the free world would knowingly make such a tradeoff.
<BR>
<P><P><P>I don't own my ideas. My ideas own me, and if I'm not the best vehicle 
<BR>
for their propogation and evolution, they will find someone who is.
