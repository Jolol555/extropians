<P><EM>&gt; Oh, why bother.  I really am starting to get a bit frustrated over here.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been talking about this for weeks and it doesn't seem to have any effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatsoever.  Nobody is even bothering to distinguish between subgoals and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supergoals.  You're all just playing with words.

<P>Hey!  Wait a second.  If you are going to be a leader in the greatest
<BR>
project in human history (or in any project for that matter) you have to
<BR>
learn and learn damn fast to be able to motivate and enroll people.  You
<BR>
don't do that by voicing your frustration every few attempts at
<BR>
explanation or by effectively washing your hands of people when they ask
<BR>
questions or accussing them of either stupidity or &quot;playing with
<BR>
words&quot;.  You may believe the AI Sysop is the only viable solution and
<BR>
you might even be right.  But you badly need some human beings enrolled
<BR>
in the dream for this thing to ever get built. You need other human
<BR>
beings to understand enough to keep you from getting lynched or shut
<BR>
down for trying such a thing.  
<BR>
<P>You are so brilliant is so many ways but I think you have a lot to learn
<BR>
about reaching and working with people.  The success of the project
<BR>
depends hugely on you learning that.
