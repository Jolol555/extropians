<P>I think that its been pretty fairly shown from Speer and Hayek that Hitler was,
<BR>
in fact, a socialist, but he was also a madman. Speer said that Hitler was odd
<BR>
in that he was the only person Speer has ever known in his life who was
<BR>
completely dead in the eyes, like he was some sort of soulless automaton. The
<BR>
only times he saw him get excited was when the two of them were going over
<BR>
architectural plans (Speer came into the Nazi Party in 1930 only as a result of
<BR>
his architectural work for several party halls, and reached prominence when he
<BR>
designed the set of the famous/infamous Nuremburg Rallies at the approval of
<BR>
Hitler, and Hitler would often refer to Speer as 'my architect', even in the
<BR>
late war years when Speer was the head of Arms and Armaments (essentially the
<BR>
whole economy)), especially when they were going over plans for his new capital
<BR>
city of &quot;Germania&quot; that they would build after the war. He also noticed this odd
<BR>
thing about Hitler at rallies, that he would come in, and speak quietly,
<BR>
emotionally at first, then this switch would occur, where he would light up into
<BR>
this preacher-like sermonizing of hysterical proportions. When Hitler would have
<BR>
social get togethers at Birktesgarten, Speer observed that Hitler seemed to act
<BR>
the dutiful host, serving others, pouring drinks, etc. in some detached
<BR>
automated way, like he knew that that was what real people did and he was trying
<BR>
desperately to act human.
