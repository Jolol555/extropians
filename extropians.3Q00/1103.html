Okay, I've managed some serious posts on this topic in the last two days and
<BR>
I want to add a general comment about the major issues here.
<BR>
<P><P>As I see it, technology is enabling the ease of distribution of information.
<BR>
If we then argue this as a reason for the removal of ownership of
<BR>
information, it is only a technological hop, skip and jump before we remove
<BR>
ownership of material goods as well.  This is not some sort of arbitrary
<BR>
slippery slope argument:  I don't draw strong distinctions between
<BR>
information and matter because, frankly, I believe matter -is- information.
<BR>
<P>Right now we download music from the net... tomorrow, we're downloading
<BR>
automobiles.
<BR>
<P>If I can point a device at an Intel factory and then go print out their
<BR>
latest super chip on my deluxe household NanoMax!(tm) I think it becomes
<BR>
clear that relgating theft to the realm of forcible entry or
<BR>
non-reproducible goods is *really* short sighted.
<BR>
<P>Why don't we like theft?  Because if I don't get to see reward for a
<BR>
particular type of work, I'll stop doing it.  Positive feedback is not only
<BR>
necessary for our economy, it is, in my opinion, the defining motivator of
<BR>
the auto-evolutionary movement.  We have to continue to engineer selection
<BR>
forces to create favorable environments for the production of things we
<BR>
want.  Nature can take care of us only so far... making sure we feed
<BR>
ourselves and mate with each other.  It is our responsibility now to create
<BR>
our own environment, custom built to reward behavior that we desire.
<BR>
Arbitrary removal of reward systems is not a good idea!  If we don't want
<BR>
something, fine, but our desire for information and our desire for the
<BR>
evolution and refinement of information is only going to increase.  Let's
<BR>
continue to motivate people to produce the most innovative stuff possible.
<BR>
<P>I've never considered myself a capitalist per se, but I think it's quite
<BR>
clear what humans are capable of producing in the pursuit of wealth.
<BR>
