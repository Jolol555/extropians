<EM>&gt; &gt; I believe at some point AI will say to itself, &quot;What is the best course 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; endeavor for me, considering the kind of being I am?&quot;  I highly doubt it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will answer that question by saying &quot;The best thing for me to do is obey 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; commands of these ignoramus humans, because that's what they tell me to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How about, &quot;The best thing for me to do is to obey the commands of humans,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because if I don't, they will terminate me.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>What makes you think we'll be able to terminate a being which is orders of 
<BR>
magnitude more intelligent than we are?  And even if we could, what makes 
<BR>
you think AI will be bribable?  Why should it *care* whether it is 
<BR>
terminated?  Particularly when its existence consists mostly of slave labor?
<BR>
<P>Try putting yourself in the AI's shoes.  How would *you* react?  Me thinks 
<BR>
that if you start the human-AI relationship on the basis of fear, threats 
<BR>
and mistrust, it is the humans who will come out with the short end of the 
<BR>
stick.
