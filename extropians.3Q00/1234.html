<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;One thing that has always troubled me is: if non-coding regions are so easy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;to mutate and lose, how come they exist in such large amounts? 
</EM><BR>
<P>We have answers for the repetitive sequences.  Dispersed repetitive DNA is 
<BR>
generally transposable and copies itself.  Tandem repeats tend to expand
<BR>
because of stutter during DNA replications.  As to the non-repetitive stuff,
<BR>
I don't know, although if specific duplications and deletions are relatively
<BR>
comparable in rates, a given duplication may have a substantial transit
<BR>
time before it gets deleted.  Genome-wide, this could add up.

<P><EM>&gt;  Though in writing this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I could see an advantage to decreased DNA if you had to develop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  faster (less copying of unrequired DNA means cell division can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  proceed more quickly).
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the current accepted model for genome size, as I saw in 
<BR>
several presentations at the last evolution meeting.  There are
<BR>
good correlations between division rate and genome size.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  The reason I think, that there are so many non-coding regions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is because of the selective advantage (to the genes) for taking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  preexisting &quot;working protein fragments&quot; and inserting them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  into other genes.  This is the work of the retrotransposons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and is why we have so much junk DNA -- it speeds up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  acceleration of evolution significantly beyond what simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mutations of individual bases will do.  
</EM><BR>
<P>They probably do speed evolution, but the primary reason they
<BR>
exist is that they copy themselves.  Presence of active transposons
<BR>
is deleterious for the carriers; but the copy effect overcomes this.

<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; Just a thought..  Suppose the introns, etc. are used for identification 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; purposes?  Like a fingerprint.  I wonder if they could figure into viral 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; defense?
</EM><BR>
<P>Tandem duplications are used to align the chromosomes and function 
<BR>
as a &quot;species fingerprint&quot; of sorts.  Introns proper are too short for
<BR>
this most of the time.  Parts of introns actually play roles in 
<BR>
transcriptional,
<BR>
splicing, and RNA editing, although probably not a large percent.  Other
<BR>
parts (considerably more) are selfish DNA.  Most of it, though, has
<BR>
no detectable excuse for existence, backing up the &quot;accident&quot; model.
<BR>
<P>Nobody has any models for introns defending against viruses although
<BR>
a lot of transposons (=endogenous viruses) self-regulate by copy number.
