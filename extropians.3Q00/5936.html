<EM>&gt;As a first point, many of the libertarian principles that I have seen seem to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be a slightly repackaged form of some of the more practical theories of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarchism.  In this case, it almsot seems libertarianism is an example of
</EM><BR>
both
<BR>
<EM>&gt;predictive anarchism and possibly a series of templates for the construction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of social temporary autonomous zones (and here is where I fail in
</EM><BR>
attribution;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;this idea is NOT mine).
</EM><BR>
<P>Libertarianism taken to its logical extreme does indeed lead to anarchy, or
<BR>
&quot;anarcho-capitalism&quot; to be exact.  Some of your further comments suggest
<BR>
that you don't appreciate that there is a whole spectrum of political
<BR>
thought among anarchists:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;But as such, I see the problems that associate with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarchism raising their heads:  The difficulty of organizing projects that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;require more than one or two indiviuals and/or more than the standard 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lifetime of the project organizer
</EM><BR>
<P>This would seem to be aimed at leftist anarchists, who imagine a world
<BR>
where there are no corporations or employers, just communes and
<BR>
worker-owned collectives.  Anarcho-capitalists, OTOH, don't think that
<BR>
things will work out like that when people are free: instead they suspect
<BR>
that people will continue to pool their resources and form corporations,
<BR>
with many people preferring to be employees rather than having to start
<BR>
their own business or live on a stinking communal farm.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;...the issues raised under the heading &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tragedy ofthe Commons&quot; (including and especially environmental effects),
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, anarcho-socialists are the ones who want everything to be held in
<BR>
common, as they don't believe in the institution of private property.
<BR>
Anarcho-capitalists are big believers in private property, indeed they
<BR>
would privatize damn near everything.  No commons, no tragedy....
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;and the strong potential for pockets of tyranny and other social systems to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rise and slowly absorb and perhaps subjugate those neighboring., either 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cognitively or grographically.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a problem that any system has to face--so the question really is:
<BR>
would an anarcho-capitalist country be exceptionally easy to invade or
<BR>
pervert?  With the wealth that such a social system would allow to be
<BR>
generated, it could defend itself with the best mercenaries and weaponry
<BR>
that money could buy (Mike Lorrey's protection agency might not allow their
<BR>
subscribers to keep and bear nukes, but mine would), and in facing an
<BR>
invader, they would be fighting not just for their freedom, but for their
<BR>
wealth! (talk about a motivating factor).  I admit that this is a very
<BR>
subjective answer, but it's a hard thing to quantify....

<EM>&gt;My problems are really three-fold here as to specifics.  #1:  I'v ebrought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up the environmental issue before.  Group A may wish to simply be left
</EM><BR>
alone, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;but they're deforesting a hillside above Group B's settlement, causing the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;water to be fouled and increasing the damage of floods in the springtime.  To
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fix the flood problem, Group B builds a dam to moderate flooding - but now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Group C isn't getting enough water.  How do you resolve this in a libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fashion, if negotiation fails?
</EM><BR>
<P>[Run-of-the-mill libertarians often speak of the justice system as one of
<BR>
the few things worth keeping a government around for, so I assume that you
<BR>
are looking for the radical anarcho-capitalist view here:]
<BR>
<P>The contracts that your three groups have with their insurance/protection
<BR>
agencies would probably stipulate that in the event of a conflict with a
<BR>
different agency, the issue would be settled by binding arbitration.  A
<BR>
mutually acceptable arbitrator is selected, and issues a ruling specifying
<BR>
what each group owes the others (pretty much like the present system, but
<BR>
you don't have to wait two years to get a ruling).  Monetary settlements
<BR>
would probably be handled by the insurance companies.  For the sake of
<BR>
argument, let's say it was ruled that Group B had no right to stop the
<BR>
water flowing to Group C, and both a retroactive and ongoing fine was
<BR>
levied.  Group B's insurance company pays the retroactive fine, but tells
<BR>
Group B that they must remove their dam or look for another provider.  They
<BR>
balk, lose their insurance and protection, and eventually Group C's
<BR>
protection agency shows up in force to remove the dam and seize the assets
<BR>
of Group B to pay for the fines, enforcement costs, etc.
<BR>
<P>Yes, even in an anarcho-capitalist utopia, things can come down to
<BR>
force--however the financial incentives are against it, unlike out present
<BR>
system where government cops can commit murder and get a raise.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;#2:  Not everyone will play by the &quot;non-coercive&quot; rule.  Simply look at how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powerful a memetic structure religion is.  I would love to be left alone -
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt;a group of people reading one of a handful of passages from Leviticus
</EM><BR>
suddenly 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;gets this idea that I am less deserving to live than they are.  One of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tradeoffs in modern western political systems is that this sort of
</EM><BR>
activity is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;mostly curtailed.
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems to be another case of your assuming all anarchists are alike.
<BR>
While there are some anarchists who claim to want chaos,
<BR>
anarcho-capitalists want law and order--we just want it privatized and
<BR>
de-monopolized.  If that group of fanatics lynched you for your sinful
<BR>
ways, they would face similar consequences under anarcho-capitalism as
<BR>
under US law.  The advantage of an anarcho-capitalist system is that those
<BR>
fanatics wouldn't be able to run to the polls, out-vote your group by 1,
<BR>
and make your life-style illegal.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;#3:  Markets are wonderful, btu I doubt withotu a regulatory regime that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be as resistant to fraud and manipulation as they are now.
</EM><BR>
Market-based
<BR>
<EM>&gt;systems work, but I don't know if I could trust a mechanism that operates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the honor system to play such a vital role in my life
</EM><BR>
<P>The market is wonderful--no sooner do you express a thought like the above
<BR>
then people start to look at it as an indication of a new market niche:
<BR>
private certification agencies to keep an eye on the markets for nervous
<BR>
customers like yourself.  No honor system involved--they earn your money or
<BR>
you take your business to their competition....
