<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; hat is not the same thing. Yes, you can move around the matter in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  universe quite a bit using small impulses and a lot of time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cleverness. But the theorem actually says you cannot close an open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  universe no matter what, it has to do with the spacetime topology and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cannot be changed by merely (say) piling all the matter into a big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ball or something similar. To make matters worse, we have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cosmological constant to deal with too. Of course, quantum gravity and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  such things may complicate things enough to enable closure, but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  remains in the realm of wishing for the moment. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh yes, I never said that Tipler's Cosmology, which is merely a compilation 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the work by J.A. Wheeler at U of Texas as well as the late Charles 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Meissner from MIT, was a complete theory, merely a very strong hypothesis. I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wonder why, we give all of eternity over to these universal constants and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then say it shall be so forever? Like Ray Kurzweil, I hold that intelligence 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (meat or silicon) is a decent way for the universe or ensamble of universes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to change things.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, I have no disagreement with that. I'm actively promoting it. But
<BR>
the problem is: can intelligence convert an open into a closed
<BR>
universe? Even if intelligence acts on the largest scales and has all
<BR>
available physical knowledge it may not be able to do such a thing. It
<BR>
may of course be that we will soon discover an easy trick of doing it
<BR>
(just involving 10^12 galaxy-masses of relativistic neutronium or
<BR>
something other easily obtainable :-). But you cannot build a very
<BR>
believable theory on the *possibility* that the laws we know are wrong
<BR>
(it would be like a theory that began &quot;Assume relativity doesn't
<BR>
hold...&quot;). That the laws of physics seem to evaporate in the presence
<BR>
of intelligence doesn't mean everything will become possible even for
<BR>
superbeings.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;Well, a neuron star is a nice thing when you want to resurrect your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   relatives all the way back to pre-dynastic Egypt and other small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    projects :-) But it doesn't give you the real, infinite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    calculations/memory storage, Omega Point. Accept no substitutes :-)  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anders please!  We mammals and other carbon/water forms are indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being forced to accept the subsititute called mortality. Along the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way many people may achieve the ecshaton through cryo- or NeoBio, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploading to Stellar Mindplaces or the Linde Scenario; but right now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its the big sleep, for all of us, unless evidenced otherwise. Keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working lads and lasses!!
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, I would gladly settle for a neuron brain in the interrim, no
<BR>
question about it. But it is *so much simpler* than the Omega Point
<BR>
(we can at least imagine how a nanotech version of it might work
<BR>
according to known physics).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;That plasma can be chaotic does not prove that it can be used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perform useful calculations. I'm not aware of any proofs that plasma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chaos is of the right kind to be Turing-complete, but I can imagine it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is. However, a real physical (nuclear) plasma is a different thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and may very well have diffusion or randomness effects that disrupts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the computations. &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am guessing you are correct, but then who the heck really thinks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about even considering using plasma as a subsitiute for computation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; except a minority of people pn this list? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it might be useful for a lot of pre-omega things (like
<BR>
colonising the stars, literally). But of course, Tipler was really
<BR>
talking about interacting modes of the Higgs field for his
<BR>
OP-computer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Maybe we need some insight from plasma physicists?  Oh, if Hannes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Alfvens were only here!
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess he would have told you to read his novel &quot;The Tale of the Big
<BR>
Computer Machine&quot; he wrote in the 60's, where he warned of
<BR>
superhumanly intelligent computers and human overdependency on them
<BR>
:-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, I was looking at the chaos (poops in the plasma) as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a potential off-on function.
</EM><BR>
<P>What would be suitable storage units? I have been thinking about
<BR>
vortex loops, they look nice and ought to be useful for something.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To sum it up, I aggree with the notion that Tipler doesn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything, just a decent round about notion. Will other concepts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like an accelerated expansion wipe out Tipler's thesis? No, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the expansion is, from what I understand, going at speeds very much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under lighspeed. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that it is accelerating due to the cosmological
<BR>
constant. The horizons are creeping closer and closer...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Given even 10 billion years to over-take the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expansion and I believe we've (whomever we've become or merged with)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will modify the cosmological environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure. I hope to be there (two ancient posthumans still debating
<BR>
cosmology - &quot;See? That cluster was not relativistic either! Told you
<BR>
so back in last eon!&quot; :-) )
