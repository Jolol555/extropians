<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;so I changed my surname. It's worked out very well. Changing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;name, like getting rid of all your crap and moving somewhere with nothing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is a very cleansing experience; highly recommended.
</EM><BR>
<P>...Or even moving somewhere else with a fair bit of stuff is a very
<BR>
cleansing experience ...! (me: moving to another country two
<BR>
years ago, next week moving to another city, both with my small
<BR>
library in tow). Yes, Highly recommended.
<BR>
<P>The Sufis have an intriguing idea of getting rid of baggage (material
<BR>
or psychological) *continually*, so that one is always killing a part
<BR>
of oneself off, i.e. &quot;making a space&quot;.  A space to think and to be and
<BR>
to be open to new elements in one's life.
<BR>
<P>I see Eli's name quest as a fundamental quest for putting a label
<BR>
on one's identity. It's something that every human everywhere must
<BR>
come to terms with, yes? (Unless you choose to be not part of any
<BR>
society and be Nameless), So then, these sorts of questions
<BR>
arise in a name change:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What parts of myself do I want to reveal to the world?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What parts do I wish to keep private?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(both of these are about what masks, if any, to wear)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What is unique about me, that I wish to show?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* What are my strengths?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* How do I view myself presently?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* How do I see myself in the future?

<EM>&gt;My name seems to fit all of criteria in your post, i.e.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Weird
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Confusing to spell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Mistaken for another gender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Only one in the phone book
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Not listed on any off-the-shelf &quot;personalised&quot; merchandise
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Do you find this a helpful thing?
</EM><BR>
<P>Mostly, since the oddities nudge people in remembering me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The gender confusion is sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;annoying, sometimes useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which depends on the context, right?
<BR>
<P>I receive random pieces of mail in  my  postal mailbox addressed
<BR>
to &quot;Herrn&quot; Graps, instead of &quot;Frau&quot; Graps, but that mail goes
<BR>
into the trash anyway.
<BR>
<P>On the Internet, The gender confusion can work as a good filter,
<BR>
because usually strangers that write me want some assistance with
<BR>
something. I figure if the person wanting my help and addressing
<BR>
me as &quot;Mr.&quot; isn't spending the 30 seconds to learn my gender,
<BR>
then their requests are usually not worth my time to which to
<BR>
respond, anyway.
<BR>
<P>In my career, I much prefer that the random stranger get my
<BR>
gender right, because the number of women in astronomy is much
<BR>
less than the number of men (and 100 times less in Germany than
<BR>
in the US), and, since I'm a noncompetititve person, and
<BR>
I have other things working against me in science (I'm a
<BR>
generalist rather than a specialist, I'm older, and my career
<BR>
path has been unusual), then my name and gender gives me
<BR>
something distinctive that is helpful.
<BR>
<P>I think that the people on this list are special- many are
<BR>
following nontraditional paths, thinking unusual things, so
<BR>
the name-label, i.e., the way that each chooses to show their
<BR>
face to other humans, then involves a process to figure out
<BR>
how to put a label on their natural ways of being.
<BR>
<P>Now Eli was talking about wanting to put some distance between
<BR>
himself now, and some posts that he wrote some years ago to the
<BR>
Internet that he'd rather not be identified with.
<BR>
<P>I have some bad news for you Eli-
<BR>
<P>**** The Internet is a strange, very large, sometimes wonderful,
<BR>
sometimes tragic beast, that WON'T FORGET what you wrote, no matter
<BR>
when you wrote it, and no matter what name under which you wrote it.
<BR>
It WILL REMEMBER you, and sometimes it will shape you into a
<BR>
different lifeform.  ****
<BR>
<P>The following is my very strangest Internet-name experience.
<BR>
<P>Three years ago, a woman at a department at the Carolinas HealthCare
<BR>
System in Charlotte, NC, wrote me, in quest of some background information
<BR>
for a quotation that the Vice President made in a presentation. The V.P.
<BR>
found the quotation in material he had from his previous job at
<BR>
a management consultant company: Ernest and Young.
<BR>
<P>The women told me that the quotation is called &quot;Amara's Law&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In reacting to change, there is a tendency to overestimate the
<BR>
impact of change in the short run and underestimate its long term impact.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I thought: HOLY-MOLEY!! (as Batman says). This quotation was taken
<BR>
from a post I made to the sci.physics Usenet group 1 1/2 years earlier,
<BR>
about the &quot;Physics of Traffic Flows&quot;, where I said:
<BR>
<P>&quot;One rule-of-thumb in responding to any stimulus that one does not want to
<BR>
become unstable is: the longer one waits in response to a stimulus, the
<BR>
strength of that response should be exponentially less with respect to
<BR>
that time.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(which was paraphrasing my old physics prof, Dr. Elliot Montroll,
<BR>
at UC Irvine)
<BR>
<P>So my Usenet post surfaces in a slightly different way as &quot;Amara's Law&quot;
<BR>
in a management department in a health care company in South Carolina?!!
<BR>
(EEEK)
<BR>
<P>I gave the woman my post that began the whole
<BR>
thing,(<A HREF="http://www.amara.com/ftpstuff/traffic.txt">http://www.amara.com/ftpstuff/traffic.txt</A>), I asked her
<BR>
to please get the attribution right (to Elliot Montroll), and
<BR>
then I asked myself whether it was time to quit Usenet.
<BR>
<P><P>So you see Eli, Real Life is Stranger than Fiction.
