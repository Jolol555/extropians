<P>Hmm.
<BR>
<P>I'm a bit involved in the Open Source scene.  (From what I read on
<BR>
this list I gather that for most participants here the Open Source
<BR>
movement is rather obscure.)  Collaborative projects there are
<BR>
typically developed by teleworking only.  Social interaction in
<BR>
the flesh just isn't an option, so it works without.
<BR>
<P>As an example, let's consider the OpenBSD project, which provides
<BR>
a full-fledged unix operating system widely considered to be the
<BR>
most secure one around.  There are a few dozen developers, i.e.
<BR>
people with write access to the source tree, who are spread all
<BR>
over the globe.
<BR>
<P>Communication is done synchronously by way of a private chat system
<BR>
and asynchronously by E-mail.  Occasionally, developers bump into
<BR>
each other at trade shows and have a beer together.  Once or twice
<BR>
a year, some developers manage to meet somewhere for a few days to
<BR>
hack (i.e. develop) together.  But for practical purposes, and when
<BR>
compared to usual office interactions, developers simply don't meet
<BR>
each other in person, and many never ever do.
<BR>
<P>Despite these circumstances, work progresses.
<BR>
<P>Of course, Open Source projects are hardly representative of the
<BR>
common workplace.  We're dealing with highly motivated and highly
<BR>
qualified people who *want* to collaborate, rather than a set of
<BR>
so-so employees who do the minimum required to get the next paycheck.
<BR>
<P>The personal distance introduced by teleworking may also have
<BR>
advantages.  There's little gossip.  Who's sleeping with whom isn't
<BR>
an issue and doesn't alienate co-workers.  Some people still can't
<BR>
work with certain others--it would be interesting to see whether
<BR>
personal contact would lead to the same groupings.
