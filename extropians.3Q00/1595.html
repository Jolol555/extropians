<P>
What I'd like to do is something really simple initially, you know, keep the
<BR>
scope limited until we could prove we could manage to do anything at all.
<BR>
Most likely if the initial concept to be implemented is too big (read &quot;more
<BR>
than quite tiny&quot;), there's about a 0% chance of us actually succeeding in
<BR>
doing it.
<BR>
<P>Often if you come up with a really complex game idea, you find that it can
<BR>
be decomposed into several standalone subgames; like the combat system might
<BR>
standalone as a little arena bash game, or a travel/trade subsystem might
<BR>
stand alone, or a roleplaying aspect might stand alone. If we did come up
<BR>
with a complex idea, I'd seriously suggest  breaking it into atomic
<BR>
subgames, and implementing those one at a time, hoping to tie them together
<BR>
at some point in the future.
<BR>
<P>I'd be looking at a strategy style game, html based (that's the modern
<BR>
equivalent of text based), same tech as some of the existing browser based
<BR>
games. This has many advantages;
<BR>
<P>1 - No client software to write
<BR>
2 - Easy access; people don't have to buy stuff or download software or
<BR>
whatever
<BR>
3 - Required server resources is relatively small, allowing you to run the
<BR>
thing on a reasonable server(s), rather than having to spend a fortune.
<BR>
<P>Something like this, if it's good, and attracts a lot of players, might even
<BR>
carry itself financially, because you'd carry ads in the game. No one will
<BR>
mind; people understand where free beer comes from these days. I don't know
<BR>
what revenue you could expect (lots of continued views by a fairly definable
<BR>
demographic), I'd be proceeding on the basis that we'd hope to defray costs
<BR>
at some time in the future, and that some support in the future might even
<BR>
be paid (some miserable pittance) for. Basically, I want to make a game, if
<BR>
I wanted to make money I'd do something else. If it makes money enough to
<BR>
pay for itself, then that's a huge, unexpected bonus.
<BR>
<P>On the subject of ongoing support (thanks for raising it Ryan); I'm happy
<BR>
with that. I'd really like to get a game to the point where it had a
<BR>
(growing) userbase, and I was providing ongoing support. With the online
<BR>
strategy game genre, this is not so onerous a task I think; certainly
<BR>
nowhere near as bad as writing the thing in the first place! You don't even
<BR>
need to build in intensive &quot;quest&quot; type stuff; just make a minor rule change
<BR>
now and then, and watch the entire landscape change!Anyway, that support
<BR>
part is a really fun stage; the community grows, which you are an important
<BR>
part of, and you respond to what they are doing. It's like the meta game for
<BR>
the support crew.
<BR>
<P>Trying to tie back to list subject, an important part of the game would be
<BR>
that it was a TH meme propagator of the first order. These people who'll
<BR>
play a cerebral online game (no fancy graphics, just a really challenging
<BR>
mental environment) are, I think, ripe for transhumanism. I've noticed that
<BR>
many people are very strongly influenced by the more subtle ideas that
<BR>
perfuse their gaming environment.
<BR>
<P>Also, a thread or two back I mentioned the possibility of putting real
<BR>
economic and/or political models to the test in an online game, with lots of
<BR>
players as willing guinea pigs (I'm not suggesting any deviousness). Some
<BR>
real value could be gained from such work, especially if a &quot;bought from the
<BR>
shop&quot; social scientist, like Robin, were to get involved.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, no rush, there is much blabbing, grumbling, mumbling and ranting to
<BR>
be done before anything crystalises. No reason to force it.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>(ps: Even though I said no fancy graphics, that doesn't mean no fantastic
<BR>
artwork; let's hear from interested artists. Musos too)

<EM>&gt; &gt; I know it's been tossed about before, but I'm wondering if the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; computer geeky extros might like to put together a TH game? Between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; those with coding skills, artists, musicians, and game design talent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (anders, that's you), we've got the right people. I know none of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has a lot of time, but together maybe we can make something. I'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thinking an opensource project (via sourceforge). I'm sure I contacted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someone here about doing a game some time ago, and never followed up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (sorry). If there were a few of us, we'd all be comitted (to each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; other).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That sounds like a great idea - I'd love to see what you have in mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps the first thing to do is get setup at sourceforge: That'll give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you a place to start posting some ideas, and set up a couple of discussion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lists to get some brainstorming going. If you're doing something exciting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd be interested in getting involved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been interested, on and off, in some sort of distributed mud-like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system. I'd like, for instance, to be able to walk through a door and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seamlessly be talking to another server. Or manipulate objects whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior is being computed on another machine somewhere else. You'd figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out some system where by objects (a stove, a book, etc.) declare the ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which they can be manipulated (open, close, read, etc.), along with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verb mappings, then anyone can drop new objects in, run it's innards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anywhere, and let people play with it. Some sort of Corba'ish/RMI deal.
