<EM>&gt; If, as Rand argues, man - or any uploaded or SI progeny he may produce -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a specific nature - like every other thing in the universe - then he needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific kinds of things to survive as the kind of being he is.  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; objective reality is the foundation for any discussion of objective value

<EM>&gt; and thus what really constitutes selfishness.

<P>I was going to comment on all of your stuff, but most of your post is laying
<BR>
out a position I would disagree with in one paragraph, then refuting it in
<BR>
the next paragraph.  So, we are in general agreement, which is something to
<BR>
be frightened of.  I don't recall any previous time on this list someone has
<BR>
agreed with me for such a long stretch.
<BR>
<P>As for Kant, I'm not the only person under Objectivist influence who does
<BR>
not agree with Rand's unrelenting bashing of him.  See, e.g., George Walsh's
<BR>
&quot;Ayn Rand and the Metaphysics of Kant&quot; at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/objectivity/walsh1/walsh.html">http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/objectivity/walsh1/walsh.html</A>  (For
<BR>
the record, I don't agree with all he has to say here.  I won't go over that
<BR>
here.  Just wanted to point out that I'm far from being alone.)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!

<P>A Poison Tree
<BR>
<P>I was angry with my friend:
<BR>
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
<BR>
I was angry with my foe:
<BR>
I told it not, my wrath did grow.
<BR>
<P>And I watered it in fears,
<BR>
Night and morning with my tears;
<BR>
And I sunned it with smiles,
<BR>
And with soft deceitful wiles.
<BR>
<P>And it grew both day and night,
<BR>
Till it bore an apple bright.
<BR>
And my foe beheld it shine.
<BR>
And he knew that it was mine,
<BR>
<P>And into my garden stole
<BR>
When the night had veiled the pole;
<BR>
In the morning glad I see
<BR>
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
<BR>
