Regardless of what we may think of Rifkin he seems to be one of the
<BR>
people who Get It when it comes to upcoming changes in the human
<BR>
condition and our relationship to nature. That doesn't preclude him
<BR>
from making huge mistakes (like the fourth law of thermodynamics), but
<BR>
he seems to share an understanding with us what technology may be able
<BR>
to achieve. The same goes for Bill Joy.
<BR>
<P>The big difference is basic values: we embrace change and
<BR>
possibilities and think that a dynamist process can solve problems,
<BR>
while Rifkin (and Joy to some extent) instead see these changes as bad
<BR>
and undesirable, and that they pose threats that can only be dealt
<BR>
with using technocratic or reactionary methods. The values are basic
<BR>
and not likely to go away just by some side having good arguments,
<BR>
what can be dealt with is how they are expressed and implemented.
<BR>
<P>There are a lot of people out there who Don't Get It, of course. When
<BR>
they hear about nanotechnology they say 'Oh, a better way of making
<BR>
stuff. So what?' since they don't see the vast mesh of drastic changes
<BR>
such a technology would lead to. Maybe they are a bit imagination
<BR>
challenged :-) Also, we should remember that they are a necessary
<BR>
antidote to the 'foo-tech will change *everything*!' meme that easily
<BR>
enraptures us (and our opponents) - if we have to explain clearly and
<BR>
rationally just why a certain technology or trend will be likely and
<BR>
cause major changes, there is a higher chance that we will be believed
<BR>
and that our ideas subjected to the critical examination (by ourselves
<BR>
and others) they need.
