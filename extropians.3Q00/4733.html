<P>
Chaitin's paper is at the same time much better and much worse than I
<BR>
was expecting.
<BR>
<P>I was expecting bad philosophy which relied heavily on resemblances to
<BR>
make its inference.  This is bad philosophy in the same way that
<BR>
Hofstadter's GEB is bad philosophy: he draws your attention to a
<BR>
number of interesting things that have a certain resemblance, and then
<BR>
goes on to suggest that this resemblance is more than superficial.
<BR>
(Yes, look, they ALL have STRANGE LOOPS; therefore, er, therefore
<BR>
they're all very interesting.)  [Good books may nonetheless contain
<BR>
bad philosophy.]
<BR>
<P>Chaitin's paper relies heavily on an equation he's cooked up which
<BR>
takes parameters.  Pop in the parameters and you get equations which
<BR>
either have a finite number of solutions or an infinite number of
<BR>
solutions; you can't tell which, of course, without solving the
<BR>
halting problem.  Accepting as an axiom that one of them has a finite
<BR>
number of solutions (or an infinite number of solutions, your pick)
<BR>
doesn't help you to derive the solutions to any of the others, at all.
<BR>
Their solutions are formally independent, just as it is independent
<BR>
whether, when you flip a coin, the next toss will be heads or tails.
<BR>
No amount of reasoning will yield the next result.
<BR>
<P>Yet, interestingly, you can also show that in half of the cases, the
<BR>
equations will have a finite number of solutions, and in the other
<BR>
half, they'll have an infinite number of solutions.  Thus, he can make
<BR>
a provable statistical claim about these things, despite the fact that
<BR>
he can't formally derive any one of them on the basis of the others.
<BR>
That, he says, is just like the statistical result that half your coin
<BR>
flips will be heads.
<BR>
<P>He suggests a new course of research: that we should check out these
<BR>
arithmetical coin tosses, yielding a branch of statistical arithmetic
<BR>
just as we have statistical mechanics.
<BR>
<P>The relationship to epistemology, though, looks rather weak to me.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-unless you love someone-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-nothing else makes any sense-
<BR>
