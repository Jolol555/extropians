I am grateful to the Extropian Institute for a number of things.  I have gotten so much pleasure from this list which seems to always have something to spark my interest.  I feel honored to be allowed to be here and in my own small way contribute.  Only in the internet age does a person of relatively humble circumstances get to mingle with people of such educated, accomplished and varied backgrounds as I have found here.  I am grateful to call many of you friend.
<BR>
<P>In some groups I might have been censored, but I find my various views and beliefs have been allowed here.  People may disagree with me at time, but in a respectful way.  Some talk about the &quot;close-mindedness&quot; of extropians, but I see a very open forum for discussion here.
<BR>
<P>I have read in fascination about the Extro conventions.  I hope dearly that I am able to attend the next one.  That ExI can assemble such an array of incredible people to speak on such enthralling subjects just astounds me.  And I am very grateful(as Natasha brought up) that these conferences are actually quite inexpensive as compared to others out there.  This is one poor guy saying, &quot;thanks!&quot;
<BR>
<P>I am also grateful to ExI for wading into the depths of the mass media to fight for the advancement and not hinderence of technological and social progress. Max, Natasha, Nick, Damien and others have tossed their hat into the ring with good results.
<BR>
<P>I have been able to view the world outside the way I was raised largely due to ExI and this list.  Attending college was the other thing that allowed for introspection.  This has caused me much pain but also benefitted me also.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John
