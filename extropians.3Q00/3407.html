<P><EM>&gt; The thing with the perp is that he likely doesn't have two bits to his

<EM>&gt; name, so going after him in court would be a waste, though if he truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is in school, then ruining his academic career would be nice and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rewarding. Perhaps the perp is a former student of Max's? Perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone who has been rather virulent about getting a bad grade from Max?
</EM><BR>
<P>Wait, slooooow down Hoss.  Recall the original post mentioned Keith
<BR>
Henson.  Why would one of Max's disgruntled former students do that?
<BR>
Keith scarcely ever posts to extropians, maybe half a dozen times in
<BR>
the 3 yrs Ive been reading it daily.  How would a former student of
<BR>
Max even know Keith?  If Max were the primary target, why wouldnt
<BR>
the perp have taken a swipe at one of the other prominent extropians?  If
<BR>
one reads the original post, one gets the impression that the primary
<BR>
target is Keith, and the rest of it is more like a pox on anyone who is
<BR>
his friend.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, we know plenty of people who would have a base
<BR>
motive to attack Keith Henson in any reprehensible way possible.
<BR>
We might want to ask Ralph Merkle and the cryonics group if they have
<BR>
heard from the perp.  What think ye?  spike
