Subject: Britain to allow human cloning for research
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON, Aug 13 (AFP) - The British government is set to give its  
<BR>
cautious go-ahead this week to the cloning of human embryos for 
<BR>
therapeutic research, according to media reports here Sunday. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report by the government's chief medical officer, Liam  
<BR>
Donaldson, is due to be published Wednesday, three months after it 
<BR>
was handed in. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers are expected to agree with its recommendation to allow  
<BR>
cloning, but only for research purposes, the Sunday Telegraph 
<BR>
reported. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such are the moral and ethical dimensions of the case  
<BR>
that MPs will be allowed a free vote on the issue, the paper said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, MPs vote along party lines.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing cloning of human embyro cells for research would accord  
<BR>
with the opinion of many scientists, who believe it will pave the 
<BR>
way to new cures for many illnesses. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other groups and religious organisations say cloning for  
<BR>
experimentation breaks the sanctity of human life. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the matter is the removal of pre-programmed  
<BR>
cells, called stem cells, from embryos less than 14 days old. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists have discovered that such stem cells are capable of  
<BR>
developing into any kind of tissue, including nerves, muscle, organs 
<BR>
and bone. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, one day, it was possible to direct stem cells to become  
<BR>
selected types of replacement tissue, it could be used to treat a 
<BR>
host of diseases which at present are incurable. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the embryos are cloned from a patient's own cells, it  
<BR>
would solve the serious problem of transplant tissue rejection. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research needed to bring about such a medical revolution is  
<BR>
currently banned in Britain, however. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law stands, scientists can only work with stem cells less  
<BR>
than 14 days old to carry out research into understanding fertility, 
<BR>
reproduction or congenital disorders. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using stem cells for any other purpose is outlawed, as is the  
<BR>
cloning of human embryos. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1998 two research watchdogs recommended the law be  
<BR>
relaxed to allow therapeutic cloning for medical research. Last year 
<BR>
the government set up an advisory group under Donaldson to examine 
<BR>
the issue. 
<BR>
