It sounds really cool; similiar to Utopia. Looks like they stole a time
<BR>
machine, came forward and saw Utopia, then went back in time and made their
<BR>
own copy. Or else Utopia is a rippoff.
<BR>
<P>I didn't see anything about the usual number of players per game. This power
<BR>
of having so many players was the gist of my previous posts.
<BR>
<P>I get the impression that people run little (relatively speaking) games of
<BR>
empire all over the place. I really must try it out sometime (no, no, bad).
<BR>
However, Utopia is a single game (actually two games now; they had to split
<BR>
the game for performance reasons, looks like their code isn't so scalable).
<BR>
It's entirely web (html) based, I don't think it does any client side stuff
<BR>
beyond using cookies, so you can play it from wherever you can get onto the
<BR>
net.
<BR>
<P>Utopia is not a great game. It's fairly mediocre in my reckoning; it's full
<BR>
of clunky fixes to try to retain game balance, each such resulting in rule
<BR>
changes so that each round, the rules have been changed to stop an
<BR>
unbalanced tactic from the round before, and which invariably introduce
<BR>
their own new problems.
<BR>
<P>But it is 60,000 players, and an entirely simplistic abstract geographical
<BR>
model (if you want to think in terms of a map, it is as if you were adjacent
<BR>
to every other player), that makes the game incredible. It is just soooo
<BR>
many people; such a game is qualitatively different from any small scale
<BR>
game. Strategies that work for 2 adjacent opponents, or 4, or 20, do not
<BR>
work for 60,000; new strategies emerge which are innapropriate in games with
<BR>
smaller numbers of players.

<P>I loved this quote from the Empire description:
&quot;To prevent the more fanatical Empire players from staying logged on all the
time, Empire places a limit on the amount of time you may be logged in per
day. This limit is settable by the deity, usually 1000 minutes. If you run
out of time, too bad! You can't log in again until the counter resets itself
(usually at midnight). &quot;
<P>If you use 1000 minutes in a day, you are in serious, serious, serious
trouble!!! I don't think I've racked up that much time on Utopia in a day -
too often.

&gt;
&gt; Take the advice of your elders Emlyn, dont go there.  Save yourself
&gt; while you can!  World conquest simulations are just too much fun to
&gt; resist.  spike
