<P>True, no there are no *god given rights*.
<BR>
<P>Empathy may change a persons *bad* behaviour, a person may refrain from rape
<BR>
or killing because of empathy yet the *stealing* of intellectual property
<BR>
may or may not be stopped by empathy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In essence, &quot;might makes right.&quot;  For instance, at one point in time it was
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;law in the U.S. that the black man &quot;had no rights which the white man was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bound to respect.&quot;  Why?  Because the black man was utterly without any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;power to enforce any rights he might like to take unto himself.  Did the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;black man like that state of affairs?  No.  Was it fair, perhaps not.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that's the way it was.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you abandon the concept of *fair* and the rather flaccid view of *well,
<BR>
that's just the way things are.....&quot; and instead ask &quot;What are the
<BR>
consequences of this state of affairs and how can things be made better?&quot;
<BR>
you may well improve a situation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And that's the way it is.  If you have no power to prevent me from making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use of content you create, you have no &quot;right&quot; to do so either.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have no right to *make* you leave *my stuff* alone......and I personally
<BR>
(being poor and all that!!!) have no power. But should I lack any empathy
<BR>
and sympathy plus be rich (and very pissed off) I could hire an assassin to
<BR>
change your mind.
<BR>
<P><P>You can
<BR>
<EM>&gt;piss and moan all day about what rights you think you have, but its no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different from me claiming that I have the right to inherit the moon.  Get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used to it and get over it.
</EM><BR>
<P>A belief that one has rights is not the cause of the problem. In the case of
<BR>
*intellectual theft* or simply car theft someone may be seriously pissed off
<BR>
because money may well be lost as a result (money = food, security and
<BR>
choice in most societies) so unless this person is a saint, she will be in a
<BR>
very bad state of mind!
<BR>
<P>The person put in this bad state of mind will not be able to think straight,
<BR>
will act in a pissed off way and piss others off too.
<BR>
<P><P>This isn't useful to anyone.
<BR>
<P>But I suppose that if everyone in the world could be broad minded enough to
<BR>
accept that their property (how ever they define it) is available for any
<BR>
man, woman and child to take away and use in any manner ......oh what a nice
<BR>
place this world could be (pass the sick bag)
