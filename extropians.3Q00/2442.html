<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My little sister worked part time for a local dairy farmer (she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; found dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with cows very relaxing after a long day dealing with hospital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; morons' self
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; generated problems with their computers) and is of the opinion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and the guy she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worked for is also of the opinion based on his own research, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BGH is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threat, that its all just scare tactics by 'organic' farmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; trying to boost the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; market for their higher priced products.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What sort of research did the guy your sister worked for do? I haven't seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any research on BGH, but I've looked at the research on 2,4-D, which is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synthetic plant growth hormone.  Some of the research concludes that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; causes cancer in mammals; other research says it doesn't, and it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always obvious from the published papers why there should be such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discrepancies. Possibly there's some factor that wasn't controlled for, such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as the presence or absence of other synthetic hormones in the animals'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diets, possibly some of the data was faked--who knows?
</EM><BR>
<P>I suggest you read the book _Science Under Siege_. Its very good at
<BR>
illustrating how environmentalists and 'consumer advocates' use
<BR>
fraudulent science, or misuse actual scientific data to support their
<BR>
unsupportable positions. Essentially, EVERYTHING causes cancer, if you
<BR>
feed rats enough of just that substance. Bran can be made to cause rats
<BR>
cancer, vitamins, life extension drugs, EVERYTHING. What you need to
<BR>
look at is the discrepancy between what is called the LD50 point (where
<BR>
50% of test animals died), and what the normal dose is. If the normal
<BR>
dose is 10 milligrams per day, and the LD50 dose is 2 kilograms per day,
<BR>
thats a significant difference, and does not provide any rational
<BR>
scientific data on its actual carcinogenic risk. The greens think that
<BR>
if any animals at all die in the test, no matter how much they were
<BR>
force fed or injected with, then its a 'carcinogenic substance'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My basic strategy is to err on the side of caution when it comes to eating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potentially powerful chemicals, whether they be naturally occurring or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; synthetic.   I don't, for example, eat datura seeds or mescal beans or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glandular secretions of frogs. Clearly, 2,4-D and BGH are not as toxic as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those things.  I may be silly to avoid them, and in fact I don't always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; avoid them. I DO sometimes eat in restaurants or at the homes of people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't as picky about their food as I am. But I don't think I'll feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfortable eating these hormones regularly until I'm able to figure out why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are such differences in the research results.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is the LD50 dose for 2,4-D, and what is the typical level found in
<BR>
a normal serving of your garden vegetables when they have been raised
<BR>
fertilized with this chemical???
