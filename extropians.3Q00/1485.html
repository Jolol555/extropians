</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't view it as adversarial. I view it more as an attempt by all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parties to discover something new, together. More of a cooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; push/pull towards some undiscovered country of the mind (and all it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entails), rather than a here's my opinion, bow down. If you'd rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have an &quot;argument&quot; I'll oblige, but I'd rather not if it's all the same

<P>Ha. Well, I understand that some people view my conversational manner as
<BR>
confrontational or argumentative. I know that in plenty of my posts, I do lose
<BR>
patience with opinions or statements that I see as uninformed or in willful
<BR>
denial of the facts, even after the facts have been clearly posted and
<BR>
referenced. People who prefer to think the best of themselves obviously resent
<BR>
when I call them by their proper names, names they deserve if they are to
<BR>
beleive the things they do without significant thought. Other people who do not
<BR>
like to have their most cherished misconceptions challenged dislike dealing with
<BR>
myself, or Lee, or others on the list who do not suffer fools so gladly as
<BR>
others seem willing to do. Being of the school that 'that which does not kill
<BR>
you makes you stronger', I look at my adversarial manner, which IMHO I actually
<BR>
rarely release in full force, as a tool by which others may improve themselves.
<BR>
I know that when others come back at me to bring my own misconceptions to my
<BR>
attention, it does improve me as well.
<BR>
<P>That being said, I do not come to the list 'looking for an argument', however,
<BR>
as seen in the stats posted regarding the percent of the population that
<BR>
beleives in creationism, there is obviously a large chunk of the population that
<BR>
is living in Egypt at any given time...
