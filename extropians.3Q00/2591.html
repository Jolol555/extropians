<EM>&gt; This is from the Seeds of Change eNewsletter #12 I was tempted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post the whole thing, but restrained myself, it can be found at

<EM>&gt; *A farmer's lament
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Don Dunklee, an organic grower in Michigan, submitted the following
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; article to our eGroup Forum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Roundup Ready genetic engineering, it was difficult to kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; milkweed in crops. My milkweeds are gone. My neighbor's milkweeds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are gone. Farmers using Roundup Ready genetics in soybeans, cotton,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corn and sugar-beets are eradicating milkweed from their field
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nationwide, forcing the monarch butterflies to lay their eggs on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; milkweed in field borders and ditches. Have we done well? Perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not by the butterflies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who ever said they deserved a free lunch? A better question: what amount
<BR>
of milkweed is usually found in natural prairie? Much as a second growth
<BR>
forest is much different from an old growth forest, a natural original
<BR>
prairie is far different from a field left fallow for a few years.
<BR>
Milkweed is not typically that prevalent in natural unirrigated prairie,
<BR>
so consequently the natural population density of monarch butterflies
<BR>
should actually be lower than the level at which we 'subsidize' their
<BR>
current population, so reducing the available food supply for them
<BR>
should only bring them back to their more natural population levels...
<BR>
<P>Moreover, although some people have wondered whether corn pollen caught
<BR>
by the milkweed strands is eaten by the butterfly caterpillars, but no
<BR>
mention is made of any facts about whether the pesticide is actually
<BR>
present in the pollen, since the crops are not sprayed during pollen
<BR>
season, but earlier.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RoundUp?

<EM>&gt; &gt;From the Organic Trade Association comes this report:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Glyphosate (commonly known as Roundup) linked to Non-Hodgkin's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Lymphoma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A population-based case-control study conducted in Sweden between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1987 and 1990 by oncologists Dr. Lennart Hardell and Dr. Mikael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eriksson concluded that exposure to herbicides and fungicides
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resulted in significantly increased risks for non-Hodgkin's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lymphoma (NHL), a form of cancer. In the study, published in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; March 15 Journal of American Cancer Society, the researchers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concluded that in particular, exposure to glyphosate &quot;yielded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increased risks for NHL&quot;. Glyphosate is the world's most widely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used herbicide. It is estimated that over 112,000 metric tons were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used worldwide during 1998. Companies developing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; herbicide-resistant crops also are increasing their production for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; herbicides such as glyphosate and requesting permits for higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; residues of these chemicals in genetically engineered food.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Monsanto, for instance, has received permits for a threefold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase in herbicide residues--from 6 parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; per million to 20 parts per million on genetically engineered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soybeans in Europe and the United States.
</EM><BR>
<P>I notice that there was no mention by the writer about what levels of
<BR>
exposure the Swedish oncologists found to be contributory toward
<BR>
increased NHL. There had to be some level of exposure they determined
<BR>
was bad, but I imagine that the bad exposure level is probably at the
<BR>
very least several times, if not hundreds of times, higer than the 6-20
<BR>
ppm level Monsanto is talking about, but if they actually admitted that,
<BR>
the greens would have to admit that its not actually a threat to human
<BR>
health.... See, thats the sort of way that these greens twist facts in
<BR>
lies.
