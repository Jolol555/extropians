<P>I know Max isnt jesus.  I am.  Or no, wait, Im satan.  I get confused.  {8^D

<P><EM>&gt; The only negative possibility I see here is if some overambitious legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement person decides to investigate Max.  That would suck.

<P>Hey, this gives me an idea.  We have gone on and oooonnnn about
<BR>
transparency, have we not?  Well here we go, this is where the rubber
<BR>
meets the road.  We have a use now, a job for those who are willing
<BR>
to have every aspect of their lives open to the brightest light of day.
<BR>
Meeeeeeee!  Im willing!  Im happy to let someone, encourage someone
<BR>
to burn their resources investigating the hell out of every aspect of my
<BR>
life.
<BR>
<P>Finally!  I recognize a possible use for having a totally G-rated life
<BR>
{tho not necessarily by choice always...  {8^D}  I and other
<BR>
extropian info-nudists can form a smoke-screen for those who
<BR>
prefer a more private life.  Anyone who wants to can hire an
<BR>
army of private investigators to watch me around the clock.
<BR>
Id be better than sominex.
<BR>
<P>I am willing to have opened every medical record, every tax return,
<BR>
every bank account, every traffic or arrest record {I have 5 speeding
<BR>
tickets, 4 of which were from overenthusiastic enjoyment of
<BR>
motorcycles}, every internet post I ever made, anything else anyone
<BR>
wants to know, honest to god, I volunteer *Everything*.
<BR>
<P>How can this be used?  spike
