<P>
I've belatedly had a chance to read Robin's futarchy paper,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf</A> or .ps.  In it Robin proposes a
<BR>
political system based essentially on Idea Futures.  Any policy for
<BR>
which an IF market predicts a substantial increase in adjusted future
<BR>
GDP would automatically be put into force.
<BR>
<P>It's a fascinating idea, although one for which people seem to come up
<BR>
with a great many objections on first exposure.  Most of Robin's paper
<BR>
is taken up with answering various objections.  At the end he gives a
<BR>
proposal for a specific form of futarchy.
<BR>
<P>I had a few concerns which may not have been clearly addressed.  The first
<BR>
is, what evidence is there that futures market predictions can work over
<BR>
the time scale envisioned for futarchy?  The paper talks about 50 year
<BR>
time horizons.  But most futures markets only predict prices a few months
<BR>
out.  Even the long-term LEAPS options are only good for a year or two.
<BR>
<P>Along these lines, can any conceivable system estimate GDP over such a
<BR>
long time frame?  Robin's specific proposal is to average log of GDP over
<BR>
the next few decades, discounting by a few percent a year.  What if we
<BR>
combine this with Robin's estimates from his paper on long-term growth,
<BR>
which envisions one or more transitions to much more rapid GDP growth,
<BR>
within this time frame?  We could see the economy doubling over periods
<BR>
of weeks, and later even hours.  I think with Robin's formula you'd
<BR>
get a divergent series; at a minimum, the sum would be dominated by the
<BR>
ultra-explosive growth we hit during the Singularity.
<BR>
<P>I was somewhat confused by the futarchy descriptions of the legal
<BR>
structure as being composed of nested policies, with more fundamental
<BR>
policies authorizing less fundamental ones.  This does describe the
<BR>
current regime to some extent, but how would it work with futarchy?
<BR>
Would more-fundamental policies constrain less-fundamental ones?  How
<BR>
would this be enforced, by the courts?
<BR>
<P>The other point that seemed troublesome to me was the tremendous
<BR>
complexity of current laws.  A recent widely debated case was
<BR>
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which put forth new forms
<BR>
of intellectual property protection.  The DMCA is available at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/ip/DMCA/hr2281_dmca_law_19981020_pl105-304.html">http://www.eff.org/ip/DMCA/hr2281_dmca_law_19981020_pl105-304.html</A>.
<BR>
It is 24 sections in 5 titles; a total of 4570 lines long.  This is 90
<BR>
pages of dense text.
<BR>
<P>I don't see how such a complex document could successfully make it through
<BR>
a futarchy process.  How would the text be developed?  Currently a process
<BR>
exists in which various competing interests influence legislatures
<BR>
to try to get language the way they want it.  But presumably &quot;pure&quot;
<BR>
futarchy doesn't want to retain this kind of lobbying.
<BR>
<P>At the other extreme you could let anyone propose any law, but there
<BR>
would be so many possible variations on even a simple 5 or 10 page
<BR>
law that it's hard to see how the market could work.  Every different
<BR>
clause or section could be reworded, added or removed.  You'd have a
<BR>
combinatorial explosion of possible documents.
<BR>
<P>DMCA may not be a great example because many people oppose it, but
<BR>
probably even its opponents would agree that it ought to be offered as a
<BR>
possibility in a futarchy system.  There are substantial issues at stake
<BR>
regarding the economic impacts of intellectual property protection, and
<BR>
if futarchy could shed light on these issues that would be a valuable
<BR>
contribution.
<BR>
<P>I'd say that with examples like this, the less extreme forms of futarchy
<BR>
could work well.  Answer the question, would the DMCA help or hurt
<BR>
economic growth over the next five or ten years.  Getting a market
<BR>
consensus on this issue would be helpful.  But it's harder to see how
<BR>
the pure futarchy system could generate such laws.
<BR>
<P>Robin's document is somewhat sparse in its description of these
<BR>
procedural issues.  He suggests using the futarchy market itself to
<BR>
evaluate different ways of handling these matters.  This is a consistent
<BR>
viewpoint but it makes it harder to evaluate the system because we can't
<BR>
know in advance how the specifics would work.  I'd like to see futarchy
<BR>
details fleshed out a little more as a straw man proposal.
