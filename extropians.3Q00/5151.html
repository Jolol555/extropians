<P>I previously worked for a startup; ouch, ouch. The correct euphemism would
<BR>
be &quot;an important learning experience&quot;. Ouch.
<BR>
<P>I'm currently working for a company that I don't think calls itself a
<BR>
startup, but it's kind of close (I think it's main differences from a
<BR>
startup might be profitability &amp; an unlikeliness to explode in flames at any
<BR>
second - a good thing!)
<BR>
<P>I do like the world of startups; I don't think I could work for a large org
<BR>
again in a hurry; my personality is only just growing back as it is.
<BR>
Startups of course are not some glorious paradise; they have some rather
<BR>
thorny aspects. However, it's the kind of environment I'd expect to suit an
<BR>
extrope - what's the old cliche? &quot;Rugged individualist&quot;? If you can add
<BR>
&quot;thick skinned&quot; to that, it's the way to go.
<BR>
<P>The idea of working with people from these virtual parts is a big drawcard
<BR>
for me. You have to spend a lot of time with people you work with; best if
<BR>
they're not total arseholes (a big ask). I like you guys, even the ones that
<BR>
piss me off!
<BR>
<P>So, my five spare minutes a day is up for grabs; anyone?
<BR>

<BR>
(translation: I'm not available, but hey, I'd still like to know what's
<BR>
going on if anyone organises something)
