<EM>&gt;  Illinois scientists on Friday said they have successfully implanted 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;silicon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  microchips beneath human retinas for the first time, a procedure that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;holds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  promise for millions of people with failing eyesight... &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Howsomever....I have higher hopes than is mentioned in the article.  I not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only want my vison restored to it's former greatness...I want it improved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Super-man/ 6million dollar man (that's enough to buy lunch after taxes)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sight.....higher and lower freq.   Custom Preprocessing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;routines......&lt;shade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all dopplered &quot;incoming&quot; to red for instant recognition....receding to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blue&gt;....and various other things I haven't thought of yet....
</EM><BR>
<P>I feel ya EvMick.  I'm thinking I'd really like to be able to see the entire 
<BR>
EM spectrum.  But it would probably have to come with an on/off switch or 
<BR>
radio dial-like selector.  Seems like if you saw the entire spectrum *at the 
<BR>
same time*, it would be pretty difficult to differentiate anything.  Perhaps 
<BR>
everything would look bright white?
