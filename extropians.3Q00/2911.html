<EM>&gt; &gt; scary.  My &quot;guardian,&quot; my &quot;protector?&quot;  It will bring good things to me?

<EM>&gt; &gt; Did these guys ever read _Brave New World_ or _1984_?  -Zero

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Zero, you and I were among those who were advocating a more transparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society.  This latest little girl who was kidnapped Thursday and was recovered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yesterday could be the poster child for open society.  How about it, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parents?  Would you be in favor of ID implants for your kids?  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem here is that such a thing could become compulsory.  The problem with a
<BR>
transparent society are twofold.
<BR>
<P>One, there is no guarantee that everyone will be equally transparent.  I see it as
<BR>
perfectly reasonable that only the rich will afford privacy, making it instead a
<BR>
totalitarian nightmare.  If it's not equal across the board then its tyranny,
<BR>
because it gives a select few unequal advantage. The same could be said of guns
<BR>
(ouch!  sorry to bring this up again).  If disarmament is not omni-lateral, then
<BR>
those with the guns make the rules - period.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, assuming a transparent society becomes completely omni-lateral, instead
<BR>
of everyone being forced to tolerate everyone else's ideosynchrocies, a backlash
<BR>
could happen where societies norms are even more oppressive, as everyone is forced
<BR>
to &quot;behave&quot;  in the what was the sanctuary of their once private homes.  Imagine
<BR>
loosing that great job you've had for 5 years when your prudish boss finds you
<BR>
like a little S&amp;M on occasion.
<BR>
<P>Until I see proof that transparency fosters a more liberated society, I'm not
<BR>
buying this crap anymore.
