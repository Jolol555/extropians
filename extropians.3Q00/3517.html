<EM>&gt;EvMick, hauling a load of computers stops for a beer. As he approaches
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the bar he sees a big sign on the door saying &quot;NERDS NOT ALLOWED ENTER AT
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;YOUR OWN RISK&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mickey goes in and sits down. The bartender comes over to him, sniffs, and
</EM><BR>
says
<BR>
<EM>&gt;he smells kind of nerdy, then asks him what he does for a living.  Everett
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;says he drives a truck and the smell is just from the computers he is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hauling. The bartender says OK, truck drivers aren't nerds, and serves him a
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;beer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As he is sipping his beer, spike Jones walks in white tape around his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;glasses, a pocket protector with 12 kinds of pens and pencils in it and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;belt at least a foot too long. {Every belt ever made is at least a foot too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long for spike.}  The bartender, without saying a word, pulls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out a shotgun and blows spike away. {8-[
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;EvMick, in total shock, asks him why he did that.  The bartender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said not to worry, the nerds are overpopulating the Silicon Valley and are
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt;season now, you don't even need a license.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;EvMick finishes his beer, gets back in his rig and back on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freeway. Suddenly he veers to avoid an accident and the computers spill out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all over the freeway. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming,
</EM><BR>
grabbing
<BR>
<EM>&gt;up the computers. They are all engineers, accountants, and programmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Wanting to protect his cargo and remembering the bar incident, EvMick pulls
</EM><BR>
out
<BR>
<EM>&gt;his gun and starts blasting away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;at him to stop.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Everett asks, &quot;What's wrong? I thought nerds were in season.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Well sure,&quot; said the patrolman, &quot;...but you aren't allowed to use bait.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>{8^D  couldnt resist.  spike
