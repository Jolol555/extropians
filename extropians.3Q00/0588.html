<P>
This thread leads me to repost something I sent to the list back in January:
<BR>
<P>The recent discussion of theism prompts me to dust off a theory that has been 
<BR>
germinating in my head for some time about the human animal's seemingly 
<BR>
hard-wired propensity to find the action of supernatural beings in nature and 
<BR>
to accept such explanations so readily.  
<BR>
<P>Consider that primates are innately social beings and that primate societies 
<BR>
are inherently hierarchical.  Our ancestors followed a path of radically 
<BR>
successful evolution in the area of social organization; so much so that we 
<BR>
could be quite correct to say that the human brain is an organ specialized to 
<BR>
the task of organizing social behavior among humans.  Our brains are 
<BR>
exquisitely adapted to perceiving and interpreting the signaling of intention 
<BR>
in others of our kind.  We see this in the innate propensity of people to 
<BR>
&quot;see faces&quot; in everything from cloud formations to the pattern of the grain 
<BR>
of wood.  Even the least intelligent humans are quite adept at discerning 
<BR>
facial expressions and discerning minute variations in the shape of human 
<BR>
faces as a cue to individual identity.  Likewise the auditory apparatus of 
<BR>
the human brain is highly sensitive to detecting human vocal output and 
<BR>
interpreting its meaning and emotional tone.
<BR>
<P>All of this evolved mechanism seems aimed at facilitating the activity of 
<BR>
humans in social groups, and is built on a pre-existing suite of capabilities 
<BR>
that is already very highly refined in the general primate stock from which 
<BR>
our species evolved.  Observing even the most &quot;primitive&quot; of our ancestors 
<BR>
(for instance, my little lemur companions), one sees intelligence devoted in 
<BR>
large measure to the perception and interpretation of fine gradations of 
<BR>
social behavior, especially of detecting and predicting INTENTION.  
<BR>
Individual members of primate species are highly rewarded in the reproduction 
<BR>
process for the ability to create and maintain accurate models of social 
<BR>
intention.
<BR>
<P>These internal cognitive models of social intention are, among our particular 
<BR>
evolutionary antecedents, highly hierarchical.  Primates seem to devote a 
<BR>
large proportion of their physical and mental energy to establishing, sorting 
<BR>
out and maintaining a pecking order.  Being good at figuring out the social 
<BR>
hierarchy of one's companions was one of the primary determinants of 
<BR>
reproductive success of every single one of the ancestors of every single 
<BR>
human being alive today.  Thus the recurring theme in our art, literature and 
<BR>
myth of conflict over the social appropriateness of would-be mating partners, 
<BR>
a subject that seems to be of never-ending interest to human beings.
<BR>
<P>In sum, there seems to be a hard-wired structure to our cognitive apparatus 
<BR>
to see the intentional action of others of our kind and to interpret that 
<BR>
action in terms of social hierarchy.  That all &quot;primitive&quot; religions are 
<BR>
animistic, therefore, shouldn't surprise us.  Seeing the action of 
<BR>
intentional actors in natural phenomena is simply what we are programmed by 
<BR>
evolution to perceive.  Ranking the hierarchical position of real or imagined 
<BR>
intentional actors is likewise the natural pathway of thought in our brains.
<BR>
<P>Perceiving that anthropomorphic gods are the cause of any dynamic activity we 
<BR>
perceive in the world around us is therefore the most natural outcome of our 
<BR>
brain's response to that activity.  Sensing a hierarchical relationship to 
<BR>
those perceived beings is likewise the most probable response to that 
<BR>
perception of anthropomorphic gods.  Reverence toward such imagined actors 
<BR>
is, furthermore, the result of our innate social characteristics - Successful 
<BR>
primates are ones who respond to social hierarchies correctly (although note 
<BR>
that &quot;correct&quot; responses can be quite varied: Thus a suave, i.e. socially 
<BR>
adept, trickster may be perceived as more reproductively attractive than a 
<BR>
potential mate who responds to dominant individuals in a simple submissive 
<BR>
way, viz. James Bond).  
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, this theory would explain much of the emotional reaction that 
<BR>
humans have to challenges to religious constructs current in their particular 
<BR>
social group.  Heresy, apostasy and atheism elicit the same emotional 
<BR>
reaction that all challenges to the existing hierarchical ordering of a 
<BR>
primate group causes.  Observe the behavior of any primate troop when a 
<BR>
challenge occurs in the hierarchy: All members of the group become agitated 
<BR>
when, for instance, a member defies the current &quot;alpha&quot; in some way, because 
<BR>
a challenge to any part of the existing hierarchy sets off a whole cascade of 
<BR>
re-ordering throughout the troop, and may ultimately threaten the survival of 
<BR>
the whole group.  The higher in the hierarchy the challenge takes place, the 
<BR>
more re-ordering is necessary and the greater the threat to the group, since 
<BR>
there is a downward spiral of challenges to &quot;legitimacy&quot; as a result.  In 
<BR>
fact, in general, ANY behavior involving high-status group members attracts 
<BR>
the attention of most of the members of the troop, since any interaction with 
<BR>
high-status members potentially effects the social relationships of ALL of 
<BR>
the members.  Thus , primates are naturally drawn to observe and judge the 
<BR>
social surroundings of high-status members of their group (explaining in 
<BR>
large part our fascination with celebrity, as well as our seemingly innate 
<BR>
attention to the ritual propitiation of imagined &quot;alphas&quot; of the spiritual 
<BR>
kind).
<BR>
<P>I'm sure this idea has been put forward by someone else before.  It seems 
<BR>
like a patently obvious explanation for what appears to be the universal, 
<BR>
instinctive religious activity of our kind.
