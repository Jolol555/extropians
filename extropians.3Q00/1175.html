Hello All,
<BR>
<P>I'm reporting from the SmartCard-run Sun Microsystems Net Terminals on the
<BR>
main floor of Cisco Networkers.  Just prior to lunch I was lucky enough to
<BR>
attend a keynote from author/columnist/advisor Peter Schwartz on the subject
<BR>
of where we've come and where we're going.  
<BR>
<P>Like most &quot;visionaries&quot; the results of his visions are beyond his life span
<BR>
and therefore default his responsibilities to them.  However he made some
<BR>
interesting points that I will categorize in a longer e-mail later.
<BR>
<P>Never having read any of his stuff, I walk away from his speech with the
<BR>
feeling that he's a rich optimist -- and I don't have to wonder which came
<BR>
first...
<BR>
<P>However I got a chance to briefly meet with him afterward and introduced
<BR>
myself in the name of my company and -- just to test the waters -- the
<BR>
Extropy Institute, which brought what seemed to be a rare sort of smile to
<BR>
his face. 
<BR>
<P>Anyway, all's well here and I hope the same goes for wherever you all are as
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P>-crw.
