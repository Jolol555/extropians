<EM>&gt;How on Earth do they judge the significant effect size without a control

<EM>&gt;randomly selected photograph as well as the target?  Not as far as I can

<EM>&gt;tell.  If so, the whole experiment is entirely meaningless.

<P>Well, not *entirely*. We can still make informed but informal assessments
<BR>
of apparently gobsmackingly unlikely phenomena, assuming that the report is
<BR>
trustworthy. If it's not, there's no point discussing the topic - or any
<BR>
topic making unusual claims.
<BR>
<P>But of course I agree with Eli. The significance estimates are based on
<BR>
procedures usually found only in the technical papers, not on informal web
<BR>
sites. Here's my own recent exchange with Joe McMoneagle, raising the same
<BR>
issue:
<BR>
<P>==========================
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My lifetime [23 year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;record] for good guesses in free-response RV type tasking is about 55% --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which I figure is pretty good guessing.
</EM><BR>
<P>How should we calibrate this, Joe? Against what mean chance expectation? 
<BR>
<P>I assume by `free-response' you mean that you could have generated *any*
<BR>
description of *anything*, which makes your results seem incalculably
<BR>
impressive. 
<BR>
<P>But I suppose in reality, even with such a protocol, there are only so many
<BR>
likely descriptors - you're not, presumably, about to describe a sky made
<BR>
of purple rock, or a giant green grasshopper with Elvis's head. I would
<BR>
hope your success in a given task is therefore assessed by blind judging
<BR>
against a small random selection of your previous RV reports, or against a
<BR>
set provided by others. (The former method might have the advantage of
<BR>
tapping your idiosyncratic image bank, which might help compensate for
<BR>
personal response biases.)
<BR>
<P>=================================
<BR>
<P>But by all means, let's not look through the telescope. He might be lying,
<BR>
and his claims fly in the face of... of... Oh, that's right, we don't
<BR>
actually have a Holy Book in science, just a series of mutable if robust
<BR>
hypotheses within paradigmatic frameworks, and observations of varying
<BR>
degrees of reliability and salience.
