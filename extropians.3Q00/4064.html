<P>
I'm still overtaxed at work, so I'm only partially plugged in here, but 
<BR>
thought I'd pass on a question that's been buzzing through my head during my 
<BR>
morning commute for the last couple of days.
<BR>
<P>Being a commercial lawyer in Houston over the last 15 years, I've naturally 
<BR>
had a lot of involvement with the energy industry.  As much as I think that 
<BR>
eco-doomers overhype both the rate at which we are depleting natural 
<BR>
hydrocarbon reserves and the impact of fossil fuel use on the environment, 
<BR>
there is no question that natural hydrocarbons are a limited resource and 
<BR>
that they have some negative impact on the environment and the quality of 
<BR>
human life.  In the long run, fossil fuels are a dead end.
<BR>
<P>Driving along the freeway on many of these 106 degree (that's 50, for you 
<BR>
progressives), cloudless days, I can't help but be struck by the obvious 
<BR>
direction we should be going, which is solar energy in the most direct 
<BR>
fashion.  So how are we doing?  Can someone point me to good resources to 
<BR>
quickly get up to speed on the state of the art in direct photovoltaic 
<BR>
technology and the rate of progress in that field?  How close are we to 
<BR>
practical industrial-scale photovoltaics?
<BR>
<P>The &quot;independent power&quot; industry that is one of my main clienteles is moving 
<BR>
rapidly to dismantle the old, lumbering institutional machinery of regulated 
<BR>
monopoly electric utilities and, in the process, is making the power market a 
<BR>
fluid and flexible transmission system for inputs from lots of different 
<BR>
generating technologies at a broad range of scales.  It strikes me that we 
<BR>
might see a beneficial &quot;line crossing&quot; of two trends soon: The rebuilding of 
<BR>
our power grid in a more rational fashion and the coming of new generating 
<BR>
technologies that can be plugged into that grid.  I know what the line is 
<BR>
like on the business front, but what's the line really like on the technology 
<BR>
front?
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
