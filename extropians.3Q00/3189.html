<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; wo, the Kosovar refugee problem starting only after the bombs began

<EM>&gt;  dropping.  Recall, the &quot;genocide&quot; that took place in Kosovo totalled
</EM><BR>
under
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  60 deaths.  Granted, any death is bad, but this hardly smacks of genocide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and looks more like what the Serbians originally said, viz.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  counter-terrorism and police operations.  (If you disagree, then remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  three things.  First, Serbia, then and now, had the military might to
</EM><BR>
kill a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  lot more people.  Second, why weren't there huge refugee movements before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the bombing began.  Did the Kosovar Albanians only decide to start
</EM><BR>
fleeing
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  when the bombs started to drop?  Third, where is the evidence for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pre-bombing mass graves in Kosovo?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am not sure I disagree with your premise,
</EM><BR>
<P>What premise is that?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; however, I see the response to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kosovo really being a too little, too late, for Bosnia in 1992 where
</EM><BR>
genocide
<BR>
<EM>&gt; was undertaken by the Milosevic government and security forces. That was
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; time to darken Belgrade with hig explosives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Problem one: Serbia was not the only side doing such things during the
<BR>
Bosnian war.  In fact, Croatia got off pretty clean given its actions then,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Our
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is this &quot;our&quot;?  Were you there?  Or where you at the Pentagon?  The
<BR>
White House?  Perhaps the UN?  I just want to get an idea of your
<BR>
involvement in this process.  My role in all of this has been as the
<BR>
_unwilling_ source of funds for foreign adventurism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; effort should have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (then) to depose the Chetnik government. I am a big fan of Low Intensity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Warfare, or High Intensity-short duration warfare.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm a big critic of warfare in general, though I do allow for exceptions.
<BR>
I'm not against anyone volunteering to go over there and fight as a private
<BR>
soldier.  I think the US government should stay out of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why? Because its costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less lives and has the chance of removing dictatorships that cause mass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; murder. These are no absolutes, and the morality is questionable; but so
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; being a by-stander while the Gulag churns out corpses.
</EM><BR>
<P>The easiest way to remove a dictator: one bullet right through the brain.
<BR>
That doesn't take a massed army.  It doesn't take a concerted alliance
<BR>
against him or her.  Just one bullet from one gun.  Game over.
<BR>
<P>I have to get back to making sure things happen, especially with a name
<BR>
like,
