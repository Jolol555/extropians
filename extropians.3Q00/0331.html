You might clarify this by explaining why you unnecessarily conjoin belief in 
<BR>
a spiritual reality with a belief in god, as one could have a belief in a 
<BR>
spiritual reality without believing in god (I do)

<EM> &gt; [sorry - but really, John, you've got to *get over
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; this pathetic kindergarten fantasy*]
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been making a list of the reasons why I suspect
<BR>
people are prone to believe in deities.  This has
<BR>
probably been covered before but I missed it.
<BR>
<P>BTW, this doesn't mean I'm an atheist.  It means that
<BR>
I see lots of reasons why we are predisposed to
<BR>
believing in god(s). This makes me pretty skeptical of
<BR>
any human-generated belief system regarding a creator.
<BR>
<P>I'd be interested in hearing about any possible
<BR>
reasons that I've missed.
<BR>
<P>---------------------------------------
<BR>
1.  To deal with the loss of loved ones
<BR>
<P>Earliest beliefs may not have centered so much around
<BR>
god as they did an afterlife.  The belief that there
<BR>
is a life beyond this mortal one is a natural response
<BR>
to the feelings of grief experienced by those who have
<BR>
lost a child or a spouse.  These losses are still the
<BR>
most devastating emotional experience a human being
<BR>
typically has in his/her life.  It is certainly no
<BR>
surprise that primitive people created the concept of
<BR>
an afterlife as a coping mechanism to deal with death
<BR>
of their loved ones.  It is much more comforting to
<BR>
think of our dead as still alive ... somewhere.
<BR>
Weren't flowers laid upon neanderthal graves believed
<BR>
to be the first signs of religious ritual?
<BR>
<P>2. Personal Death Anxiety
<BR>
<P>Our general instinct to survive carries over from the
<BR>
physical domain into the psychological. I suspect that
<BR>
this reason is actually secondary in importance to the
<BR>
loss of loved ones.
<BR>
<P>3. To make sense of the universe
<BR>
<P>Moon gods, sun gods, wind gods, etc.  We are curious
<BR>
monkeys, compelled to make meaning out of our
<BR>
experiences.  When confronted with apparently
<BR>
unexplainable phenomena, we tend to generate stories
<BR>
which substitute for true understanding (aka &quot;pathetic
<BR>
kindergarten fantasies).
<BR>
<P>4. An attempt to manipulate the environment
<BR>
<P>Experiencing threatening elements in an environment
<BR>
which seem beyond our control generates anxiety
<BR>
(earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, etc.)  The solution
<BR>
is to create gods who are in control.  This allows us
<BR>
to pray to those gods and to at least have some
<BR>
indirect influence/control over the elements.
<BR>
<P>5. The Parent Figure
<BR>
<P>We are psychologically attracted to the idea of the
<BR>
ultimately wise, forgiving, protecting, beneficent,
<BR>
and benevolent parent. (our heavenly father, holy
<BR>
mother).
<BR>
<P>6. Let God Decide
<BR>
<P>Many people appear to relish the idea that they can
<BR>
relinquish responsibility for their lives by placing
<BR>
it in God’s hands.  This tends to happen when
<BR>
decisions are very difficult to make either due to
<BR>
complexity or to insufficient information.  This
<BR>
strategy once again serves to relieve anxiety and
<BR>
provides hope to those who perceive themselves to be
<BR>
in hopeless situations.
<BR>
<P>7. We like rituals.
<BR>
<P>We’re attracted to the rituals and the structure of
<BR>
religious organizations.  These institutions provide
<BR>
us with formulas for salvation.  In addition, they
<BR>
provide the moral guidance that many have problems
<BR>
developing for themselves.
<BR>
<P>8. Social conformity
<BR>
<P>Many believe in god because all their neighbors
<BR>
believe in god, and it would not be in their best
<BR>
social interests to eschew those belief systems.
<BR>
<P>9. Our anthropomorphic tendencies
<BR>
<P>People tend to anthropomorphize things around them
<BR>
because it is a useful strategy with survival value.
<BR>
Assuming that the things you come across are animate
<BR>
and purposeful is a safer mistake to make than the
<BR>
converse. We have evolved to see persons everywhere.
<BR>
With typical sloppiness, our brains use the &quot;dealing
<BR>
with people&quot; faculties to handle interactions with
<BR>
things that are not people at all.
<BR>
<P>Identifying the personality behind a phenomena gives
<BR>
us the illusion that we can then predict what that
<BR>
persnality will do next.  And being able to anticipate
<BR>
the future helps to relieve anxiety.  Stewart Gutherie
<BR>
has a book on this idea ... that religion, all
<BR>
religion, at it's core is nothing other than applying
<BR>
this useful and important survival strategy to the
<BR>
world at large.  Anthropomorphism is not an error that
<BR>
the religious sometimes fall into. It is the very
<BR>
essence of religious thought and feeling.
<BR>
<P>The problem, of course, is that it is all a very
<BR>
reasonable and safe mistake. There is no God. There is
<BR>
no consciousness behind nature. But we persist in
<BR>
seeing it anyway, just as we persist in seeing
<BR>
humanlike figures in inkblots. That's why religion is
<BR>
so pervasive. That's why it seems so natural. That's
<BR>
why &quot;so many people&quot; can be so wrong. (I'm mostly
<BR>
quoting Gutherie here)
<BR>
<P>10.  Altered states of consciousness
<BR>
<P>It so happens that humans experience a wide variety of
<BR>
psychologically anomalous experiences.  Maslow called
<BR>
one class of them “peak” experiences, heightened
<BR>
levels of consciousness, suggesting that every
<BR>
religion’s founder probably had a peak experience of
<BR>
some type.  Whatever is responsible for out-of-body
<BR>
experiences, near-death experiences, and other altered
<BR>
states tends to convince those who have them that
<BR>
there is a spiritual reality.
<BR>
<P>11. The Observer Illusion
<BR>
<P>We have a long history of separating the mind from the
<BR>
body because it often seems to us that we are
<BR>
observing and controlling ourselves to one degree or
<BR>
another.  This leads us to think that there is a
<BR>
separation between the mind (i.e. the spirit) and the
<BR>
body (i.e. the brain).  We naturally enough conclude
<BR>
that the observer, the narrator in our head is
<BR>
evidence for god and a spiritual reality.
<BR>
<P>12. Ignorance
<BR>
<P>There is a tendency for humans to conclude that
<BR>
unknown things are also unknowable things (i.e.
<BR>
ignorance is rationalized by attaching the notion of
<BR>
inexplicability).
<BR>
<P>13. The Power of Myth
<BR>
<P>The story of Jesus is a classic tale of the hero.
<BR>
There’s the prophecy, the chastity, the pureness of
<BR>
character and deed, the betrayal and the denial by
<BR>
those he loved, the self-doubt but finally facing his
<BR>
fear and sacrificing his life for his beliefs, and
<BR>
finally ... the resurrection ... the transformation
<BR>
into the true savior, proving he was right all along.
<BR>
What a great story to tell around the campfire.
<BR>
<P>The hero myth is the most powerful myth in the human
<BR>
psyche and has been told over and over.  The biggest
<BR>
religions have a hero story don't they? ... Muhammad,
<BR>
Buddha, Jesus?
<BR>
