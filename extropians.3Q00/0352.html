<EM>&gt; &gt; Any of our rocket experts heard about this?:  Inventor building

<EM>&gt; &gt; rocket in back yard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; BEND, Ore. - Brian Walker, a toy inventor with no college degree and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; almost no flight experience, plans to blast himself into space next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; summer in a rocket he is building in his back yard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The numbers look about right, 7k pounds of H2O2 to get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 30 miles up, but the forward thruster arrangement looks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prone to oscillating instability.  But perhaps hes worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out a tricky way around that problem.  If he just wants a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 30 mile straight up joyride, seems like he might be better off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buying a spare sounding rocket from one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commercial outfits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyhows, good luck and nobodyspeed, Mr. Walker!  spike

<P>I've corresponded with Brian, suggested a few reference books for him to
<BR>
read, and strongly urged him to do some subscale experiments.  He's
<BR>
laboring under the mistaken impression that a rocket backpack is
<BR>
inherently stable, while in fact it is continuously guided by small
<BR>
movements of the pilot, just like a standing person.  Remove (or
<BR>
blindfold) the pilot and it will crash in seconds.  His vehicle layout
<BR>
is definitely aerodynamically unstable, so it would tumble out of
<BR>
control quickly.
