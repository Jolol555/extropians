<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Do you believe birth control is wholly effective?  No?  Do you believe

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nearly must have sexual activity to stay sane for part of their lives?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe yes?  Then it is obvious that women cannot fully claim to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; chosen to get pregnant every time they do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No more and no less so than the male who is 'irresponsible'.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bull.  Males don't have to carry babies.  They don't have to be more
<BR>
careful in their partners lest one leave them pregnant or a parent with
<BR>
no support.  At least not in the &quot;wild&quot;.  It is a bit different now
<BR>
days, for better or worse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Males, in case you haven't noticed, are much more irresponsible, er
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; driven to have sex as often as possible and with less consideration of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consequences (as a gender based generality) than females.  A male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't have to stick around to bear any consequences and it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ludricrous to claim that he generally has as much say in whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; woman decides to abort as she does.  Especially if there is no binding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; contract between them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If there is no binding contract, then it should be a two way street. The concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of equal protection applies. If the woman has the right to choose to bind the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; male into an 18 year indenturment for the support of the child, then the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should have the same legal right to indenture the female.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Much of the time a male cannot be bound to support successfully even if
<BR>
there was a binding contract.  No one has any honest right to indenture
<BR>
anyone.  Except if both people agreed beforehand to produce a baby (not
<BR>
a fetus) and to raise it to maturity.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; All three bodies do not have equal stakes and one of those bodies is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even a person but a fetus.  So what is it with this wierd position?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Callous my ass.  Carry around a fetal parasite within you that you never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wanted at the insistent of people who claim the right to pressure you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do so and then tell me all these other people and psuedo-people have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; same right and stake.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, with the woman, its merely a matter of 9 months of discomfort and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medical risk. With the fetus, its a matter of life and death, literally, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the male its a matter of 18 years of unconsented indenturement. Any claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the stakes for the mother are greater than the stakes for the fetus is, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its core, its own proof of selfishness and callousness. Any claim that 18 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of financial indenturement is a miniscule violation of one's rights is also its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own proof of selfishness and callousness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Merely&quot;?  What bloody right do you have to tell any human being that
<BR>
you can force ver to endure one day of this much less 9 months? 
<BR>
Pregnancy takes a fairly considerable toll on the body.  And it fills
<BR>
the woman with all kinds of deep emotional attachments through hormonal
<BR>
changes.  Evolution programs human beings for these things.  The fetus
<BR>
is not a human being (at least not unambiguously) so speaking of its
<BR>
life and death as if on the same footing with the mother is quite
<BR>
disingenous.  The male involved has zero rights to force the woman to
<BR>
bear his child if that is not what she wants.  I don't believe in the
<BR>
financial or physical indenturement of anyone.  And additional wrongs
<BR>
(some of the current laws) do not make it right in any way shape or form
<BR>
to force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think the self-centeredness selfishness goes two ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think so, and since you don't know anything about that particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationship of mine, your comments are unfounded and merely ad homenim.
</EM><BR>
<P>If all you see is self-centeredness in what was not your decision to
<BR>
make and for all you know may have been pretty difficult to live with
<BR>
then  that on the face of it looks a bit closed-minded to me.  I could
<BR>
be wrong.
