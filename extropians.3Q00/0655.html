&lt;I don't know if it's fair for someone to term Extopianism as Reactionary,
<BR>
Libertarian, for sure. The Libertarian aspect is that technology and money
<BR>
come together best under capitalism.  They does not mean that dictatorships
<BR>
cannot achieve grand things as for as technical development goes, but to
<BR>
keep an open society, capitalism, so far, seems to facilitate it best.&gt;
<BR>
<P>I agree, it is not fair. Unfortunately we had (in Italy) a kind of
<BR>
socialism, in the '20s, which changed into fascism, in the '30s, which
<BR>
changed into a catholic-democracy, in the '50s, which changed into a
<BR>
catholic-communism, in the '70s, which is changing now into a sort of
<BR>
plasma-politics (about 48 parties!). So we use political terms in a strange
<BR>
manner, now. Any way the writer there was just saying that the extropian
<BR>
individualism seems to be very strong (or provocative) and reacts to the
<BR>
political constraints. (In Italy this reaction is reactionary).
