|For example, one piece of information that would be valuable for every

<BR>

<BR>
|hard physically to hurt someone else (esp. in their vulnerable places).
<BR>

<BR>
|In my opinion, the hard part of that action is actually in one's mind-
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
|action against you, then that person has lost all rights, and it's
<BR>
|morally OK to take action against them. That exercise must be worked
<BR>
|through far in advance of any real-life threatening situation, so that
<BR>
|if, or when, it happens in one's life, then you can act
<BR>
|*instinctively*, without thinking (the mind would then just get in the

<P>If an animal attacks me, then I feel obligated to neutralize it.
<BR>
Whether the animal is human or not is totally irrelevant.
<BR>
Morals never come into it, just simple neutralization of an attacker.
<BR>
<P>In non-technological combat, the easiest way of neutralization is
<BR>
to hurt the attacker physically in an efficient manner so it cannot
<BR>
continue the attack, e.g. by breaking a leg so it cannot move itself,
<BR>
or taking out its nervous system by making it unconscious.
