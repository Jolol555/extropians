<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The &quot;owning&quot; is not all on the part of the men, of course.  Many women want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to &quot;own&quot; their spouses or SO's as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I know. I don't think I had a &quot;thing&quot; with ownership.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What I found difficult to bear about marriage, and why I bailed even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my husband was a wonderful person, was the way in which it made life...how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can I say this?...predictable? stable?
</EM><BR>
<P>This was not an issue for me. I did like the companionship and
<BR>
some basic stability. The companionship was especially nice, maybe
<BR>
because my spouse and I shared 95% of my hobbies and interests. But
<BR>
common interests are not enough to make a marriage.
<BR>
<P>I stopped my marriage for several reasons: some things intrinsic to
<BR>
he and I, and, it was not possible for me to follow my biggest dreams
<BR>
in that marriage, and, it was bad for me financially. I learned many
<BR>
important things about myself in the marriage, though.
<BR>
<P>Where the cultural aspect comes in was a strong voice (meme?) in my head
<BR>
saying that I *should* be married or that I can't stand strong on my own
<BR>
without a partner. Or maybe this was not cultural and simply part of
<BR>
my psychological makeup? Whatever the reason, it took a while for me
<BR>
to overcome that voice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Did you find yourself falling into the roles on your own, setting yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up, so to speak, or did your husband steer you into the roles?
</EM><BR>
<P>It was both.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Along these lines, I remember my mother saying to me when I was 12 or 13,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;You're probably going to have a hard time finding a husband.  It'll be hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for you to find a man who's smarter than you.&quot;  At the time I thought, &quot;Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the heck would I want to find a man who's smarter than me?&quot; but later, of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course, I realized it was because the man was supposed to be the boss, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who wants to be bossed around by someone who's not as smart.
</EM><BR>
<P>He would have to be at least as smart as me or smarter.
<BR>
<P>Here's one issue that is a tangent to the smartness issue, that I
<BR>
want to mention.
<BR>
<P>My career path (passion) is in a field where there are mostly folks
<BR>
of the other gender. It's not something that I can do anything about,
<BR>
and it's not even something I notice. After the third week of working
<BR>
homework sets as a freshman with my male classmates, the fellows become
<BR>
simply classmates (or like &quot;brothers&quot;). After 20 years of working
<BR>
with mostly fellows, it's even less of an issue for me.
<BR>
<P>However for several of my romantic interests, this aspect of my
<BR>
career was a major problem. One fellow that I was deeply in love with
<BR>
even told me that he didn't want to see me any more because there were
<BR>
too many men in my field for him (and he was a scientist himself). Since
<BR>
my cultural/psych. meme was telling me that I should have a partner,
<BR>
and my emotions were telling me to sacrifice myself to the relationship,
<BR>
I faced a distressing conflict with my career choice. Leaving my
<BR>
passion (astronomy) would be like cutting off 1/2 of my body.
<BR>
<P>I've since learned that I can't do very much about other people's fears,
<BR>
and now looking back, the situation looks silly, (or maybe it's a good
<BR>
litmus test), but at the time, I know it was difficult for me. And I
<BR>
wonder if I would have had the same kind of insecurities if my partner
<BR>
worked in a female-dominated career field?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I always fancied Artemis, goddess of hunt and moon.  And Inana. &quot;Inana,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great light, lioness.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I HAVE found the old myths empowering.
</EM><BR>
<P>I use the mythical archetypes sometimes as yet a different
<BR>
personality-typing system to see which part of me I'm expressing, and
<BR>
how much of those different types. It helps me see areas in my life where
<BR>
I am not paying attention.
<BR>
<P>Artemis is by far my strongest archetype. It's persisted strongly
<BR>
over the last 25 years. I like my Athena and Aphrodite sides too
<BR>
though. A four-week-old homeless black kitten arrived out of nowhere
<BR>
on my doorstep this week. Irresistable and adorable. Now my Demeter
<BR>
side is kicking in.
<BR>
<P>The Artemis archetype needs a lot of solitude. I used to need to schedule
<BR>
&quot;alone time&quot; when I was married. It never felt like it was enough
<BR>
alone time, though: I really wanted one or two weeks alone a year.
<BR>
<P>(ooops, typed too much again. 300 hours of work in June were bad
<BR>
for my hands.. flareups this week)
