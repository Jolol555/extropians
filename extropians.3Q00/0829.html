<P>True.

<P>Well, no. In *some* species (or sub-species), it has worked out that way.
<BR>
But puppy dogs and pussy cats have ample frequent litters, while humans
<BR>
tend only to have singletons (and, if the nursery story tale is correct, so
<BR>
do lions - `Just one... but he is a *lion*'). Many fishies spawn like mad
<BR>
things. So there are lots of different strategies in the phase space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    &gt;*unless* the costs of maintaining its numerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &gt;and specialised tissues are very much greater than throwing an adult
</EM><BR>
soma
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    &gt;away and starting with ignorant near-copies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think that's exactly why evolution never thought it was worth the bother to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come up with an immortal animal. Why do you think that explanation for aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is insufficient?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd like to see the mechanism, and the explicit cost/benefit chart. It
<BR>
needs to show exactly why different critters sharing the same indices can
<BR>
vary in lifespan by huge ratios - 1:10, etc. Maybe it's all in the ecology
<BR>
and variant risks of predation. Or maybe it's mainly drunkard's walk - with
<BR>
the geneplexes of many beasties staying back near the wall because, yes,
<BR>
that's one viable way to do it, but more elaborate solutions are doing
<BR>
quite okay too, way out there past the kerb.
