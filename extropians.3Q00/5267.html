<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, what Samantha describes is what is known as a hypnogogic trance, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; same sort of phenomenon that is now thought to trigger sleepwalking, OOB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experiences, and alien abduction experiences (which used to be thought of as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; visitations from the eldritch fairies). It has more, I think, to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; narcolepsy than epilepsy (having had two rather odd experiences myself once, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; being a known narcoleptic from excessive caffiene use (its an odd allergy, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only comes up when I am taking about a half a pack a day of no-doze).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike, that ain't an allergy, that's an *overdose*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Been there, done that, broke the coffee mug.
</EM><BR>
<P>I first noticed the overt symptoms while at tech school while in the Air Force.
<BR>
We were outside Champaign-Urbana, at Chanute AFB. A hot muggy, corn pollen
<BR>
filled summer (AH AH AAACHOOOO). Classes were from 8 am to 5 pm. 50 minutes of
<BR>
class, 5 minute quiz, 5 minute break. Old air conditioning (but effective). I
<BR>
was popping a no-doze every hour trying to stay awake during class, but I'd
<BR>
always fall asleep at least 10-15 minutes into it. Of course it was a
<BR>
narcoleptic seizure, not really sleep, as I was fully aware of what was going on
<BR>
in class. They'd wake me up for the quiz, expecting me to flunk it, but I'd ace
<BR>
it every time. The instructors, of course, hated me, but so long as I kept
<BR>
getting A's, there was little they could do. I think I finished the four month
<BR>
course (aircraft electrical/electronic systems) with an average of about 98,
<BR>
which was one of the top 5 class averages ever, most of it 'asleep'.
<BR>
<P>It was only about 6 months later that I read of a medical study that showed that
<BR>
some people have an allergic reaction to excessive caffeine that manifests as a
<BR>
narcoleptic seizure....
