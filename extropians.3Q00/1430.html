<EM>&gt; No its not. A copyright is an unsigned social contract enforced by law,
</EM><BR>
where
<BR>
<EM>&gt; private use contracts where the parties explicitely agree to the terms
</EM><BR>
prior to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the release of information are entirely different. Your failure to
</EM><BR>
understand
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this difference is exactly why you continue to try to argue these points.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I don't fail to understand this difference-- you just fail to
<BR>
accept that I don't attribute your distinction with relevance to this
<BR>
discussion.
<BR>
<P>As you say: &quot;A copyright is an unsigned social contract enforced by law.&quot;
<BR>
In essence it is a social agreement to attribute ownership and/or control
<BR>
and/or rights of usage to an intellectual property.
<BR>
<P>Which is exactly what a private use contract between two parties would be.
<BR>
Unlike your assertation above, they are -not- entirely different, in fact
<BR>
they are fundamentally alike in terms of their nature-- they are arbitrary
<BR>
agreements about the rights associated to a particular piece of information
<BR>
or product.  They both propose to control your use and rights by recourse to
<BR>
legal means.
<BR>
<P>The reason I found it odd that you introduced the concept at all, is because
<BR>
of this reliance on the control of an individuals rights over their usage of
<BR>
a piece of intellectual property.  A copyright law simply says that my ideas
<BR>
are -always- protected---- independent of me signing an exclusive legal
<BR>
document with you, I have ownership over what comes out of my head.  If you
<BR>
allow that it is in people's best interests to sign the sorts of contracts
<BR>
that you introduced to this discussion, (and if it wasn't a good idea to
<BR>
make such a contract, why did you bring it up?) then it would therefore
<BR>
follow that they would always be signing them.
<BR>
<P>I suppose a filmmaker then could just put up a webpage promoting a new
<BR>
movie-- and ask that prospective patrons sign a contract agreeing to pay for
<BR>
said movie if and when they decide to go see it.
<BR>
<P>Since most people would like to retain some sort of ownership over their
<BR>
intellectual property, shouldn't we make that the default state?  It is
<BR>
trivial for me to reliquish control over my intellectual property.  If there
<BR>
are really advantages to the content being free, then people will pick up on
<BR>
that and make their content free.  Which they are already doing.
<BR>
<P><P>Again, to be clear, if you grant that there is a good reason for us to sign
<BR>
a contract restricting your use of my content, then you are recognizing the
<BR>
value of controlled usage and/or ownership.  Which is, of course, my
<BR>
argument.
