<EM>&gt; Very small indeed. Sadly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are some really dynamite old games around,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which wont work in current OSes. I keep &quot;Tie 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fighter&quot; around, because I just loved that game - I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know the flight model is naughty, but the game 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself is fantastic. 
</EM><BR>
<P>True. Too true.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Doom (I) is another big one (maybe that will work 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under windows?).
</EM><BR>
<P>Works for me... I run it on my Win95 box quite
<BR>
frequently, with nary a problem thus far, and on the
<BR>
Win98 one occasionally, no problems there yet
<BR>
either...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I've given up trying to get those games to run under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; win 9x 
</EM><BR>
<P>When they aren't happy in a DOS session from in
<BR>
Windows, I just reboot into DOS-only mode and they
<BR>
work fine.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (actually I use NT, which makes possibilities really
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; remote).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, maybe you could create a seperate partition (DOS
<BR>
doesn't like NTFS) and install DOS on it (party!
<BR>
party!), and then dual-boot into it...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What I'm intending to do is get a really hot little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 486 together, or maybe a low end pentium, with heaps
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; of memory &amp; HD space, totally over specced. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know, like 16 meg of ram and maybe even a 1 gig hd.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wow! 
</EM><BR>
<P>Honestly, my 95'er isn't much better than that!! :)
<BR>
Got it only a month or two after Win95's first OSR;
<BR>
originally equipped with 1.2 GB HD (now 6.4, but only
<BR>
because the old one died-- luckily I was able to
<BR>
rescue my &gt;3 yrs of data and programs from it before
<BR>
it went completely), 90MHz Pentium I (both processor
<BR>
and motherboard still not upgraded, sadly), 6x CD-ROM
<BR>
(now 48x - fastest thing in the whole system, lol...
<BR>
when the 6x died, the 48x was the slowest model (other
<BR>
than the DVD drives of varying speeds) the local
<BR>
computer store had in stock! same with the harddrive,
<BR>
it was the smallest there), mediocre soundcard (now on
<BR>
the third upgrade-- they just keep dying! ;) ), 2MB
<BR>
video card (still the same... ~sigh~), a 3.5&quot; diskette
<BR>
drive (at least *that* still works, lol), and a 17&quot;
<BR>
(wow those were expensive back then, lol) monitor from
<BR>
some company I've never heard of anywhere else named
<BR>
&quot;Shamrock&quot; (oddly, the best thing in the whole
<BR>
system-- haven't had a single problem with it yet,
<BR>
either). All that for only ~US$3K! (urk, really stings
<BR>
now, in the age of fully-loaded GHz systems for less
<BR>
than that...) Hey, don't laugh *quite* so hard, that
<BR>
was top-of-the-line back then!! ;) Ah, witness Moore's
<BR>
law in effect! :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Then pop DOS 6 on, config it to do all kinds of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tricks so that there's upwards of 700K of base
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memory available, and away we go! 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep. Vroom vroom. :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There are a whole bunch of excellent games from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; era when that was state of the art, which I could 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never play properly because my machine wasn't top of
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; the line; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Heh, at least I was &quot;top-of-the-line&quot; for a while...
<BR>
okay, for a little while, at least... okay, years and
<BR>
years ago... aaaah, never mind ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I always wanted to come back to them in the future 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and give it a real go. I guess I'm in the future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now (Year 2000!), so it's time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, it's The Future(TM) now, all right... and just
<BR>
think, in a year we'll have interplanetary
<BR>
spaceflight, AI, widely-used vidphones, and perfect
<BR>
speech-recognition! ;) Either that, or the
<BR>
Apocalypse(TM) that we missed Jan 2000 is waiting till
<BR>
the *real* First Day Of The New Millennium (don't
<BR>
believe what Prince says! LIES! nothing but lies!)
<BR>
...as determined by our arbitrary system of measuring
<BR>
time... and will strike in ~162 days (heck, it's not
<BR>
even nessecarily the same day in different parts of
<BR>
the world at any given time! what, is it going to
<BR>
strike 24 seperate times, in clearly defined areas of
<BR>
the planet as designated by the time-zones? if not,
<BR>
then which time-zone's time will it go by? ;) ) when
<BR>
the 21st century actually *does* roll around...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is anyone actually doing this? Is it as fun as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect?
</EM><BR>
<P>lol, it's about all the gaming complexity the Win95
<BR>
system can handle, so it's never seen much more than
<BR>
old DOS games anyhow... still have quite a collection
<BR>
of 'em (the ones I haven't lost the disks/CDs for, at
<BR>
least!)... One of my favorites is &quot;Cyberia&quot;; dude, now
<BR>
*that* is awesome DOS graphics!! ;)
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
Woah. I think I've rambled on long enough now. :)
<BR>
<P>Onward,
<BR>
