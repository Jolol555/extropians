Thank you for your response, Cymm.

<P><P><EM>&gt; First, biological coevolution benefits the genes - not the species 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (...it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also tends to generate environmental complexity...)
</EM><BR>
<P>But the carrier of the genes (as a species) benefits as well, as do
<BR>
individual members of the species.  At this moment, I am personally
<BR>
benefitting from the preservations of genes which allow me to read and
<BR>
think.
<BR>
<P>... conceivably, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could have memetic coevolution... but...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...that assumes that the timescales of the coevolving species are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comparable... there's a big mismatch between rates of human memetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;You're certainly right about the mismatch in rates of evolution, and
<BR>
it's true that the EA's in the papers I linked to were written for the
<BR>
purposes of evolving such things as sorting networks and job scheduling
<BR>
programs which operate at computer speeds.  But I'm not sure that the
<BR>
rates of evolution must be the same in order for coevolution to take
<BR>
place.  For example, humans and bacteria evolve (biologically) at very
<BR>
different rates, and yet if you look at the history of epidemics caused
<BR>
by bacteria  it's clear that coevolution between the bacteria and the
<BR>
human hosts does take place--one reason is that susceptible humans die
<BR>
off (as I said in one of my earlier posts, it's likely that some humans
<BR>
would die as a result of having to contend with AI).  Another reason is
<BR>
that the bacteria evolve towards being less lethal to their hosts. 
<BR>
<P>You might say that the difference in rates of evolution is greater
<BR>
between humans (and other biological entities) and AI's than between
<BR>
bacteria and humans.  But we were discussing the AI's interaction with
<BR>
the environment outside the computer or network of computers. Part of the
<BR>
EA would include monitoring the outside environment and deciding on
<BR>
desirable changes--it shouldn't matter to the AI if such changes in its
<BR>
behavior towards these other organisms take place at a slower rate than
<BR>
the AI's general rate of cognitive evolution.
