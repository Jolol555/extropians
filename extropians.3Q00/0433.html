</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm. I would hazard that there are many things, I call them pet peeves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; =), that all people who live in proximity do (or don't do) that make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life a little bit of a chore. By the same token, there are probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little things that both men and women do that you would find extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pleasant in your living arrangement. Indeed, you've mentioned some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true.  But I've had 2 fairly long-term female housemates--one I
<BR>
lived with for 7 years, the other almost 10.  Sure, there were things we did
<BR>
to get on each other's nerves, but we were always able to talk about it and
<BR>
work it out. And above all, we were free of each other.  We did things
<BR>
together sometimes; other times we did things separately.  No big deal.
<BR>
OTOH, with the men (I use the plural because, although I've only had the one
<BR>
husband--unless you count the Sicilian guy I was married to for 6 months
<BR>
when I was 26 whose family turned out to be mixed up with the Mafia--I lived
<BR>
with two other guys without marrying them and dated lots of guys over the
<BR>
years)there always seems to be more of an obligation to do almost everything
<BR>
with them, go almost everywhere with them, BE there for them all the time.
<BR>
And when I would go my own way anyhow, I'd either have to put up with
<BR>
moaning or violent ranting (not all the guys I've been with have been as
<BR>
nice as my husband, and though none of them ever hit me or anything, some of
<BR>
them got mad and yelled and threw things.  Highly unpleasant).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I've heard this claim many, many times. In fact, you could say this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about any aspect of your life that needs to have consistency. When you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide to enter into an entertwined life arrangement, you need quite a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bit of consistency, that is predictability, in order for that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationship to function.
</EM><BR>
<P>But I've been in many other intertwinements:  employer/employee; business
<BR>
partner; housemate; mother/daughter.  And never in any of these others have
<BR>
I felt stifled the way I've felt in sexual relationships with men.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;Now, you can (with some work to be sure) make
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a relationship more dynamic, more chaotic, but what this needs is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; primarily two things: 1) A strong understanding of the *type* of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commitment you and the other want to have, and 2) Communication. I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stress number two enough. It is the only route by which problems will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever be resolved.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I understand #2 and agree completely. But I'm not sure what you mean by #1.
<BR>
Could you elaborate a bit more, maybe give an example of what you mean?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pardon my presumption, but if you honestly talked to him about this and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no progress was made, you made the rational choice by vacating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationship. Regret shouldn't ever enter into it. And, imo, as a side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; note, regret is a useless concept in general.
</EM><BR>
<P>I couldn't agree more that regret is useless. So is guilt.  So is a sinus
<BR>
allergy.  But that doesn't mean I don't succumb to them from time to time.
<BR>
I only pretend to be perfect. I'm not really.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It doesn't. There are people out there who have what they consider to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfect relationships (marriages even) where they frequently go days
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without seeing or speaking to one another.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard of people with perfect marriages, but I don't think I've ever
<BR>
actually met any.  I had a friend, M, who's dead now so I'm sure she
<BR>
wouldn't mind if I write about her. She was around 20 years older than I,
<BR>
and everyone held her marriage up as an exemplary marriage, as proof that
<BR>
marriage DID work sometimes.  Her husband was devoted to her.  One evening I
<BR>
was sitting around talking to her, and she said (out of the blue it seemed),
<BR>
&quot;Bonnie, you know, I've hated being married.  It's like I've never lived.
<BR>
But I didn't know what else to DO!  Getting married is what women DID in my
<BR>
day!&quot;  I almost cry now thinking about her wasted life.
<BR>
<P>Bonnie
