Thanks Michael. Yes, in the end I we were just quibbling over details.
<BR>
Still, it was interesting - better than this endless gun crap, no?

Subject: Re: Ye Are Gods
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; In a long response to Samantha Atkins on this thread, Emlyn concluded
</EM><BR>
with:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;As an aside, I think it's funny that transhumanism, which purports to
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about moving away from humanity, is actually more about what it is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fundamentally, to be human, than any other belief
</EM><BR>
system/philosophy/vision
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that I can think of. Its about us merging more fully with our tools,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;believing more strongly in our ability to reshape the universe, believing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ourselves rather than some unknowable greater force(s). What is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;essentially human, than the intimate relationship we have with our tools,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and our desire to reshape our environment using them? To lose that focus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and that ability, makes us less human; so to strengthen it, makes us more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so. The posthumans of our vision, supposedly having left humanity behind,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will be paradoxically, maximally human. Possibly not organic, but 100%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;natural, certainly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Emlyn, although I am only quoting the final paragraph of your message, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consider the message as a whole to be your best, most direct and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comprehensive statement in this discussion. I think - no, I know - that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are in greater agreement than I had previously recognized. Leaving aside
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; god-talk for the moment, and focusing on the human part of Transhumanism,
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; see that what we have each been saying in our own way is that we wish for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the best within us to be increased, maximized and extended into some form
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is more long-lived and altogether greater than we are now. Yet at the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same time, the essence of what we are now will not be changed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some would call this essence &quot;mind,&quot; or &quot;spirit,&quot; or &quot;Consciousness.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether that human essence is empowered to fantastic levels or becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something as ethereal as electrical patterns uploaded into a
</EM><BR>
Supercomputing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Object really does not matter. Call it a god or a guy, it's still one of
</EM><BR>
us.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My use of the g-d word in this discussion seems to have been a tactical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error on my part, as it pressed the emotional buttons of too many people.
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; would have been well advised to speak of Powers and potential so as not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offend atheist sensibilities.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
