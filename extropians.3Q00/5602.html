<P>I checked US crime statistics at <A HREF="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm">http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</A>,
<BR>
and I find that in the most recent year shown, 1998:
<BR>
<P>Violent Crimes:   1,531,044
<BR>
Murder:              16,914
<BR>
<P>Only 1% of all violent crimes lead to murder.  Also, I believe I've read
<BR>
elsewhere that a substantial fraction of murders do not occur in the
<BR>
context of a robbery, but rather are crimes of passion committed by people
<BR>
who know the victim.  This would further lower the chances that a mugging
<BR>
or similar violent encounter with a criminal could lead to your death.
<BR>
<P>If you're prepared to kill in response to robberies and other violent
<BR>
crimes against yourself (as I believe Mike and others advocate) then you
<BR>
must accept that there is a 99% chance that you are NOT defending your
<BR>
life, you are rather applying the death penalty to a sub-lethal crime.
<BR>
<P>I am curious, do people who advocate using guns against robbers also
<BR>
support the death penalty?  And would they support expanding the range
<BR>
of crimes which deserve death, since they are personally willing to kill
<BR>
in response to sub-lethal crimes?  Would they even go to the point that
<BR>
they would support the death penalty for robbery?
