Permanent life support by kidneys perfused with a
<BR>
vitrifiable (7.5 molar) cryoprotectant solution
<BR>
<P>Transplantation 70(1): 51-7 July 2000
<BR>
<P>Kheirabadi BS, Fahy GM
<BR>
<P>BACKGROUND: Vitrification (glass formation) is a
<BR>
potential method for indefinite term organ preservation
<BR>
that eliminates all of the conventional problems of
<BR>
freezing and thawing. A 7.5 M mixture of cryoprotectants
<BR>
known as VS4 is sufficiently concentrated, in combination
<BR>
with applied pressure, to preclude ice formation entirely
<BR>
during cooling to below the glass transition temperature
<BR>
(about -125 degrees C), at which point vitrification takes
<BR>
place, arresting further changes over time.
<BR>
METHODS: Rabbit kidneys were perfused with VS4
<BR>
according to three different protocols. The kidneys were
<BR>
evaluated using an autograft model with immediate
<BR>
contralateral nephrectomy.
<BR>
RESULTS: All three methods permitted long-term
<BR>
survival, but the best results were obtained when the
<BR>
highest concentrations were perfused at about -3
<BR>
degrees C. Using the latter protocol, the survival rate
<BR>
was 10/10, serum creatinine returned to a normal
<BR>
baseline after transient elevation, other clinical chemistry
<BR>
results normalized, and no histological damage was
<BR>
apparent 3 weeks after autografting.
<BR>
CONCLUSIONS: The results described provide the
<BR>
strongest evidence to date that it may be possible to
<BR>
bank kidneys for unlimited periods in the absence of
<BR>
ice for later transplantation.
