<P><EM>&gt; Okay, so why would I necessarily need more than a finite and limited amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charisma to handle that?  If I needed incredibly skilled and talented hackers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to act as janitors, then yes, I (or someone) would need a lot of charisma.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But attracting people to the most important job in the entire world?  How much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leadership talent do you need for *that*?
</EM><BR>
<P>Little would be needed if it was as obvious as it appears to be to you. 
<BR>
A great deal is needed to make it more obvious in actuality.  There is
<BR>
no reason to believe that all persons bright enough and motivated enough
<BR>
to be useful to the work will &quot;get it&quot; the first time around.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually herding the cats once you've got them, now, that's another issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So's PR.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>OK.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wish I knew more about dealing with people, but I no longer give it as high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; a priority as I once did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How can that be anything but a mistake when you require people, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they are the only intelligences to use in getting this thing off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ground, and their resources in order to produce the Seed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My purpose, above all else, is to design the Seed.  Other people can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; persuade.  I have to complete the design.  If being charismatic requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patterns of thought that interfere with my ability to complete the design, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if it starts taking up too much time, then forget charismatic.  I'll stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the basement and someone else will be charismatic instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That's fair enough.  As long as you have some people to do the necessary
<BR>
job of explanation and persuasion all should be reasonably well on that
<BR>
score.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Do you really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believe that all of those you need will just automatically think enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like you or agree enough with your conclusions that little/no effort is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; necessary on your part to understand and deal with them further?   What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kind of model leads you to this conclusion?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Past experience, actually.  The people I need seem to Get It on the first try,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generally speaking.  I'm not saying that they don't argue with me, or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they don't ask questions.  Mitchell Porter has been right where I have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong, on a major issue, on at least two separate occasions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Or at least all the people you know you can work with and/or are on
<BR>
board today got it quickly (or at least seemingly so in hindsight).  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; The difference is pretty hard to put into words.  I am not the judge of who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or isn't asking &quot;intelligent questions&quot;, and that's not what I'm trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say.  What I'm trying to say rather is that there is a pattern.  Mitchell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Porter groks the pattern; if he says, &quot;Eliezer, you're flat wrong about X&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then at least we're both arguing within the same pattern.  People who Get It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may agree or disagree with me, but they understand the pattern.  Rarely, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ever, do I see someone who didn't get the pattern suddenly get it after long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and acrimonious argument; the only person I can ever recall seeing do that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eric Watt Forste, which still impresses me.
</EM><BR>
<P>But it is certainly within the possible that the basic pattern itself
<BR>
has some flaws or at least reasonably questionable spots.  Then anyone
<BR>
who can or tries to point those out would be excluded if you were overly
<BR>
attached to this past-exerience based notion.  I trust that you are not
<BR>
so overly attached since it would be counter-productive to your central
<BR>
goal and I am certain that you are dedicated to that goal and aware of
<BR>
the possible problem.  
<BR>
<P>For myself I think one reason I question this so much is because it both
<BR>
is something that strongly appeals to me for several reasons and
<BR>
something that repels me simultaneously.  It is not an easy or easily
<BR>
accepted thing to believe you can in large part decide for the entire
<BR>
world by building that which out-thinks the world.  I and I am sure many
<BR>
of us doubt that humanity, without at least massive augmentation can and
<BR>
will grow up fast enough for what is coming.  Many of us also doubt that
<BR>
such a powerful AI, even as a seed, can successfully be built very soon 
<BR>
and that even if built, it would actually be a viable solution or
<BR>
outcome.
