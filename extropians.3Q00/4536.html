<P><P>Actually, it is fairly consistent.  Most western European countries appear
<BR>
to have a homeless rate more in line with Australia than the U.S.  IIRC, a
<BR>
few countries, such as Germany, actually have more homeless people in
<BR>
*absolute* terms (as I recall, the stat for Germany was 850k homeless,
<BR>
with a third of those being immigrants).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I mentioned `visible hungry homeless people'. I wonder if the definitions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vary between continents. I don't see that many filthy, demented people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wandering the streets here, panhandling and just looking awful. Admittedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't get out of the suburbs much these days, but Melbourne or Sydney
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; city proper aren't anything like I recall seeing in Manhattan, say. (The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; density of people doesn't feel all that different on the ground, especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Sydney.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the standards are about the same, but the situations are
<BR>
different.  Because much homelessness is taken care of by private
<BR>
charities in the U.S., the subpopulations of homeless people are not
<BR>
evenly distributed, as different populations tend to concentrate in areas
<BR>
that service their homeless situation best.  In contrast, in countries
<BR>
where homelessness is serviced largely by the government, I would expect
<BR>
that the subpopulations of homeless people to be distributed about the
<BR>
same as there is no significant differentiation in aid availability from
<BR>
one locale to the next.  In other words, in the U.S., people homeless by
<BR>
reason of drug addiction, mental illness, unemployment, etc. have different
<BR>
distribution patterns respectively, so you end up with concentrations in
<BR>
certain areas of some of the more overtly homeless people (e.g. the
<BR>
mentally ill homeless population), whereas you may not notice the
<BR>
homeless in other areas, such as the unemployed homeless common in rural
<BR>
areas.  It does seem that some of the more overt homeless populations
<BR>
(addiction, mental illness, and similar) tend to concentrate in the
<BR>
cities.  Many rural counties have a large homeless population because of
<BR>
low employment availability, but those homeless are outside most people's
<BR>
experience and they are not so obviously homeless (they are also typically
<BR>
taken care of quite well by the local communities).
<BR>
<P>Some cities in the U.S. do have a lot of homeless, but these are also the
<BR>
cities that have very generous social programs, lots of handouts, and very
<BR>
lenient vagrancy laws.  Around where I live, that would be places like San
<BR>
Francisco and Santa Cruz, where not surprisingly, you see most of the very
<BR>
obviously homeless people, most with addiction or mental illness problems. 
<BR>
On the other hand, some cities have essentially no visible homeless
<BR>
population.
