<P>Yes, that sounds like it would work, in as much as bureaucrats have very little
<BR>
stealth and rarely if ever do anything suddenly. If they had the capability, I
<BR>
don't doubt bureaucrats would deal with us as you describe dealing with them.
<BR>
The SIs will surely punish them. &lt;gloat&gt;

<P>&quot;Since the general civilization of mankind, I
<BR>
believe there are more instances of the
<BR>
abridgment of the freedom of the people, by
<BR>
gradual and silent encroachments of those in
<BR>
power, than by violent and sudden usurpations.&quot;
