<EM>&gt; False.  You first have to get there.  A design does not a working system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make.  And even after the working system is in place there is a non-zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amount of time when the active cooperation of others is still needed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After that there is an even longer period where charisma is needed in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; order to sell humanity on whatever decisions the Seed is making.  Or is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it planned simply to give humans no choice at all?  If so, then I have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to ask again.  In what way is this good for or even compatible with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of human beings?
</EM><BR>

<P>I surmise that the Seed has been planted.
<BR>
Koza et al. cite 24 instances where genetic programming has produced
<BR>
human-competitive results.

<BR>
<P>How is this good for humans, you ask.
<BR>
I quote from the cited work:
<BR>
&quot;Fifteen of the 24 instances... involve previously patented inventions. Six of
<BR>
these automatically created results infringe on previously issued patents... One
<BR>
of the genetically evolved results improves on a previously issued patent. Nine
<BR>
of the genetically evolved results duplicate the functionality of previously
<BR>
patented inventions in novel ways. The fact that genetic programming can evolve
<BR>
entities that infringe on previously patented inventions, improve on previously
<BR>
patented inventions, or duplicate the functionality of previously patented
<BR>
inventions suggests that genetic programming can potentially be used as an
<BR>
'invention machine' to create new and useful patentable inventions.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Get it?
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&quot;But what ... is it good for?&quot;
