</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If women did not have a reasonable option of choice due to legal or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems, as would have been the case 50 years ago in this country, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could make a different argument, certainly. 
</EM><BR>
<P>There was a film made a few years ago directed by Cher.  It consisted of
<BR>
3 short segments representing different time periods.  I found the first
<BR>
segment, early 1950's to be quite powerful.  Demi Moore played a nurse
<BR>
whose husband had been killed in WWII and who had subsequently become
<BR>
pregnant as a result of a grief-induced one-nighter with her late
<BR>
husband's younger brother.  
<BR>
<P>I came of age during this period when a woman had to risk her life in
<BR>
order to go ON with her life.  We were lucky here in Texas, because we
<BR>
could go across the border into Mexico and get abortions at
<BR>
well-maintained clinics staffed by MD's and trained nurses.  But even
<BR>
that took SOME money; and the non-rich women who didn't live close to a
<BR>
border were SOL.  
<BR>
<P>Nothing chills me more than the thought of returning to those conditions.
<BR>
&nbsp;I can think of few laws that could be more damaging to women. (The
<BR>
beginning of _If These Walls Could Talk_ is a collage of images from the
<BR>
various time periods and includes Gloria Steinham's (spelling?) classic
<BR>
line: &quot;If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.&quot;)
