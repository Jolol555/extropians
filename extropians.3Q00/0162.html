<P><EM>&gt; The techniques described in the book have been extensively used in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; third-world countries by people who were not getting enough to eat using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other methods of food production and acquisition.  The book is not so much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a how-to-do-it manual for specific techniques as a meta-design manual that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; describes how to go about turning a small piece of land into an efficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life-support system.  One of Bill's &quot;rules&quot; (which has also long been one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of my own) is that everything should have at least 2 different purposes.
</EM><BR>
<P>This meshes well with a wonderful book I own called &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; 
<BR>
by Christopher Alexander. The book gives an hierarchical set of rules for 
<BR>
constructing living areas ranging in size from a single room up to a city. 
<BR>
The author believes (and provides a fair amount of references to 
<BR>
supporting studdies) that most architecture today is far too 'single-
<BR>
purpose' and barren. He recommends that every piece of architecture must 
<BR>
at the least fulfil two purposes at its level, and be an integral part of 
<BR>
its context at the next higher level up. To aid in this, the book is a 
<BR>
list of 256 cross-referenced patterns that one should try and 
<BR>
simultaneously fulfil when building.
<BR>
<P>I fear that I am not given a very good description of the book, but I did 
<BR>
find it a real eye-openner. I should caution any Extropians who might read 
<BR>
it that Alexander doesn't seem to GET technology. For example, he gives 
<BR>
studies showing that people who live more than four floors above a public 
<BR>
thoroughfare seldom interact in a neighborly way with folks on the street. 
<BR>
He therefore assumes that appartment buildings should be no more than four 
<BR>
floors tall. He never considers what would happen if he put thoroughfares 
<BR>
through the upper stories of buildings. There are many similar lapses 
<BR>
throughout that can annoy one. I've always thought that someone should 
<BR>
update his work with a clear eye towards technological approaches to 
<BR>
fulfilling his patterns.
