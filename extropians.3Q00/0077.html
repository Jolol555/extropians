<P>Yeah - after the longest time, we're very belatedly starting to escape from
<BR>
the almost universal cultural rule that men own women.
<BR>
<P>There's been a lot of woo-woo bullshit mythologising of the wondrous sexual
<BR>
equality of `primitive' cultures such as traditional Australian aborigines.
<BR>
This latter instance seems at first glance to have some plausibility,
<BR>
because men and women have powerfully policed separate `sacred business',
<BR>
rituals, liturgy, tasks, etc. But the evidence is that these archaic
<BR>
cultures were brutally patrist anyway. Women had a tough time, unless they
<BR>
knuckled under. It's not an accident that so many legends and folk tales in
<BR>
so many cultures are about rape and other sexual property infringements...
