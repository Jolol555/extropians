<EM>&gt; Even ignoring speed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantages of uploads, since it is cheap to create uploads, the supply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increases quickly, which lowers the market wage.  I did try to explain this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff at <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>That URL is working now, and I recommend it to those interested in this
<BR>
discussion, as Robin is able to go into much more detail there.
<BR>
<P>I am still concerned about the quality of life of the uploads in this
<BR>
scenario.  Robin writes in his paper:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If level heads can be found, however, they should be told that if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uploading and copying are allowed, it is possible to make almost
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone better off. While an upload transition might reduce the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market value of ordinary people's human capital, their training and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ability to earn wages, it should increase total wealth, the total
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market value of all capital, including human capital of uploads and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others, real estate, company stock, etc. Thus it can potentially make
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each person better off.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The per-capita wealth of highly-copied uploads might decline, but that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not be a bad thing from their point of view. Their choice would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicate that they prefer many poorer copies to a single richer copy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as parents today prefer the expense of children to the rich life
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of leisure possible without them.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure you can conclude that highly-copied uploads favor
<BR>
the outcome to which their choices have led them.  It seems to me
<BR>
there are externalities in each upload's decision to reproduce itself
<BR>
which can negatively effect the other uploads by driving wages down.
<BR>
<P>Each upload may prefer the situation where there are a thousand copies
<BR>
making a million dollars each, to the one where there are a million
<BR>
copies making a thousand dollars each.  Yet each one is willing to
<BR>
make one or two copies of itself (perhaps it gets compensated by third
<BR>
parties for making those copies).  The net result is an outcome which
<BR>
is undesirable for the uploads, while each one of them made a rational
<BR>
decision in terms of his own decision.
<BR>
<P>So it seems that uploads could find themselves trapped in a situation
<BR>
where the incentives force them to sacrifice quality of life, while
<BR>
non-uploads benefit (if proper distribution methods are in place).
<BR>
<P>What happens to this scenario if the welfare of uploads is weighted
<BR>
equally with that of non-uploads, and the political system includes
<BR>
uploads in the redistribution of wealth?  Does the ease of copying
<BR>
still make everyone rich?  Or did the riches come from the fact that
<BR>
each upload copy has value, and that value was being transferred from
<BR>
the copied uploads to non-uploaded individuals?
<BR>
