&lt;snipped the preceding stuff; not so important, for here is the crux:&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; You may not like the world we have now, Emlyn, or the one we are building.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But likes and dislikes won't change a thing. Only actions matter. So tell
</EM><BR>
me
<BR>
<EM>&gt; what you propose, and what you oppose. Does only life-extension suit you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Would you oppose true immortality? The same questions apply to the godly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; levels of power and knowledge. Would you want or permit others to have
</EM><BR>
such?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Or are you simply unwilling to consider a really unbounded future?
</EM><BR>
<P>I love the world we have now... it's a crazy place. The very coolest thing
<BR>
about it, also the root of most of the bad elements (you get that), is the
<BR>
electrifying rate of global technological, and the social &amp; ideological
<BR>
change which are necessarily following from this. Every day really is a new
<BR>
day!
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong; I don't oppose any of the technologies being developed.
<BR>
I take issue only with the top level goals in some cases. Particularly, this
<BR>
goal of godhood leads to an arrogance which I can't condone. It leads to
<BR>
believing that you know better than the other six billion people kicking
<BR>
around on this planet, and that can direct actions which are not morally
<BR>
supportable; for instance, the attempt to build a guardian - I haven't
<BR>
noticed any step in the plans for such creations, which involves obtaining
<BR>
broad consensus before &quot;flicking the switch&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I should just say &quot;what the hell&quot;. After all, the more high and mighty
<BR>
the top level goals of a particular effort, the less likely they are to
<BR>
succeed, I'd intuit, and the failed journey will most likely have
<BR>
marvelously useful side products.
<BR>
<P>This is a time of unparalleled change, and will look like a walk in the park
<BR>
next to the times to come. It is a time for humility in our approach, and
<BR>
special concern for the other beings that inhabit the planet; as it becomes
<BR>
easier for the few to ignore the wishes of the many, it becomes no more
<BR>
tolerable to do so.
<BR>
<P>Also, we are playing with fire - well, actually fire is a baby's toy
<BR>
compared to the stuff we are messing with now. It's not a good time to get
<BR>
complacent and arrogant - &quot;we are as gods, ha ha ha!&quot;. It's time to be more
<BR>
humble than ever, to be open-system, to take in information from our
<BR>
environment. It's been discussed on the list just how dangerous some of the
<BR>
coming technologies are (ai, nanotech, etc), and if you go over the posts,
<BR>
you'll see that most of the danger is attributed to use of that technology
<BR>
by humans infected with the God meme. People who think that they know better
<BR>
than everyone else, who feel justified in producing externalities (like grey
<BR>
goo).
<BR>
<P>To your question - the whole point of not supporting the God meme, is that I
<BR>
don't feel I'm in any position to permit/deny any particular course of
<BR>
action to anyone (although of course I can defend my own interests, when
<BR>
threatened by people who would unleash externalities on me). I don't think
<BR>
that anyone else has any higher claim, either. We are a bunch of brainy
<BR>
monkeys, or lizards, depending how you look; we are all fallible, and always
<BR>
will be, to some extent.I'm not proposing to limit the future, I'm
<BR>
recommending a particular attitude to take with you into that future;
<BR>
recognise your essential finite nature. Fight against it, but never assume
<BR>
you've won.
<BR>
<P>I probably don't need to ramble on about this. The rate of change increases,
<BR>
and as it does, the need for openness and humility will become more evident
<BR>
to everyone, or everyone who is keeping up. Gods today, dead next week.
