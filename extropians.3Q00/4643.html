<EM>&gt; Incidentally, I find &quot;antioxidant&quot; as a generally poor excuse to take

<EM>&gt; something.  A fair percentage of all chemicals that have been described by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science could be characterized as &quot;antioxidant&quot; in nature, and most are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; toxic.  It is akin to when food companies started putting big &quot;cholesterol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free&quot; stickers on all their vegetable base products, with the apparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implication that someone else was making orange juice or cold cereal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a ton of cholesterol in it.  Or when health food companies fortify a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food product with a couple common vitamins, but use longer technical names
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and tout it as having some type of scientifically engineered supernutrient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is unique to their product (actually, my favorite is the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clever names they come up with for &quot;starch&quot; in their ingredient lists).

<P>Sorry if this is off-topic, it has to do with product ingredients.  I want to
<BR>
know exactly what goes into cigarettes that I smoke.  (Whether that is a habit
<BR>
completely without benefit is an open question.  Certainly, some choose the
<BR>
nootropic, among other, effects, in light of knowledge of absolutely proven
<BR>
health harms.)
<BR>
<P>It was on a news channel that some Mass. state law which required cigarette
<BR>
manufacturers to divulge product additives was stricken (struck?), after some
<BR>
tobacco companies filed suit.  The reason for the judge's decision was allegedly
<BR>
that requiring the cigarette manufacturers to divulge their products' ingredients
<BR>
would be the release of trade secrets.  Well, so it would be.  I think that the
<BR>
average user is not aware that there is anything besides tobacco in a cigarette.
<BR>
<P>In the U.S., it is so that tobacoo products are not governed by the Food and Drug
<BR>
Administration, otherwise they would not be allowed under current rules.
<BR>
<P>Tobacco supposedly falls under the jurisdiction of the bureau of alcohol,
<BR>
tobacco, and firearms.  That federal bureau should be restructured into two
<BR>
actually unrelated entities, the bureau of firearms and the separate bureau of
<BR>
alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco.
<BR>
<P>A pack of cigarettes costs about a quarter to manufacture, and a dollar is spent
<BR>
for each one on advertising.  There are of course distribution, stocking, and
<BR>
transaction costs, the rest is profit or tax.
<BR>
<P>About the tobacco lawsuits, damaged users haven't gotten any money from them,
<BR>
basically.  They are a ploy to avoid future litigation.
<BR>
<P>Here's a question:  if a class-action suit is judged or settled, can others not
<BR>
part of the class-action suit file their own?  That is to say, there is a group
<BR>
called class A that files suit, the suit comes and goes.  Group B later files
<BR>
suit, what does that situation entail?  Does B lose legal footing for not being
<BR>
part of the intial litigants for conditions?
<BR>
<P>My logically legal side says class B can slightly modify the suit, thus it would
<BR>
be a new suit.  To gain class-action footing for the suit under similar
<BR>
circumstances would logically follow to be feasible.
<BR>
<P>Any product with a complete list of ingredients along with complete disclosure of
<BR>
its known medical effects should be available legally without prescription to
<BR>
adults that have (anonymously) agreed to be aware of its known effects and
<BR>
disclaim damages from use.  As far as I know, no one ever signed or verified a
<BR>
waiver before lighting up.
<BR>
<P>If this is about melatonin, automatic web-search tells it to be a
<BR>
neurotransmitter affected by exposure to sunlight that affects or is an indicator
<BR>
of sleep cycles.  I was confusing it with melanin, which has to do with skin
<BR>
pigmentation.  Of course, regular exposure to sunlight is good, too much of it is
<BR>
bad.  Like any other not absolutely inert substance introduced to the body, it
<BR>
has various and complex effects.
