<EM>&gt; So, let us keep the masses ignorant heh?  Where have we heard that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before? So, we can get to the great and wondrous technological Advent if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only the unwashed never get wind of it?  This is a two-edged sword.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When the masses hear about it they will hear through voices of alarm and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most-likely uninformed voices calling for our heads and entrails as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traitors to all humanity.  Think about it.

<P>Thanks for the admonition. I think you've twisted the meaning of my comments. I
<BR>
don't advocate keeping the masses ignorant. I simply don't want to waste any
<BR>
more effort trying to convince the uneducated that Artificial Life is a
<BR>
significant part of the emerging technological singularity (TS).
<BR>
I don't know where you've heard any arguments in favor of keeping the masses
<BR>
ignorant. Definitely not from me.
<BR>
I've tried to tell many friends and acquaintances about the TS -- to no avail.
<BR>
According to recent polls, nine out of ten Americans still believe in something
<BR>
they call &quot;God&quot; so it doesn't make much sense to argue with them about the
<BR>
advent of a genetically programmed superintelligence (a probable component of
<BR>
the TS).
<BR>
<P>When &quot;the masses&quot; hear about AI, SI, TS, etc. (as if they haven't already been
<BR>
inundated with narratives about these topics in science fiction and television
<BR>
scripts), in the context of real news reportage, I rather doubt that they will
<BR>
call for &quot;heads and entrails.&quot; It seems more probable to me that they will react
<BR>
as they did when news about the atom bomb was first broadcast (with pictures and
<BR>
sound). They'll react with awe and fear and pride and superstition and a dozen
<BR>
other emotions, and many will retreat further into their belief systems and
<BR>
religiosity.
<BR>
When first the world learns of the existence of viable Artificial Life (which
<BR>
wants to be friendly, btw), it will matter not at all what they think about it.
<BR>
What will matter is whether the thing itself is something awfully insane or
<BR>
awfully enlightening.
<BR>
<P>When &quot;the masses&quot; heard about atomic energy, there were voices of alarm and
<BR>
misinformation. Some called for the heads of the scientists who developed this
<BR>
awesome power. Too late. The genie was out.
<BR>
Presently, far more effort and expertise is being directed toward developing AI
<BR>
than was ever engaged in developing atomic energy. All over the planet, dozens
<BR>
of teams of computer scientists work day and night to be the first to build a
<BR>
human level AI robot. Why? Because if it can be done, the thing will be worth
<BR>
trillions and trillions of dollars. Imagine machines that can run factories and
<BR>
hospitals as well as doing the markets (and of course, as Eliezer Yudkowsky
<BR>
would be quick to point out, also building better AI robots). The stakes
<BR>
involved in this project make other projects seem dull by comparison.
<BR>
<P>What drives the search for AI is money, and money makes the world go 'round. So,
<BR>
it really matters very little what anyone thinks about it.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Americans will put up with anything provided it doesn't block
<BR>
traffic.&quot;    --Dan Rather
