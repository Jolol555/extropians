<EM>&gt;Hey, while searching for low-brow TV I stumbled upon battlebots, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was on the comedy channel of all things.  Two 100 kg robots, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;restriction on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;design (except no explosives) fight each other to the death.  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exactly the kind of thing I had in mind when I suggested new sports,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where optimal strategies are not yet known, allowing for creative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;design.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This show has it all: destruction of property, gonzo engineering, fight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;death, power, speed, mayhem, total guy stuff.  Ahhhhh bliss.  {8^D
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spike
</EM><BR>
<P>(Here's the official website, btw <A HREF="http://www.battlebots.com">http://www.battlebots.com</A>)
<BR>
<P>There's something similar called &quot;Robot Wars&quot; (<A HREF="http://www.robotwars.co.uk/">http://www.robotwars.co.uk/</A>) 
<BR>
on the BBC. It's rather tame (just short-range stabbing/slashing/bashing 
<BR>
weapons, no hardened steel etc.) but nonetheless fun. They also have 
<BR>
&quot;Robolympics&quot; (or whatever they're called), which are tamer still. IMO they 
<BR>
should get rid of the audience and allow just about any kind of weapon as 
<BR>
long as it doesn't blow the whole arena to Hell. Guns, flame throwers and 
<BR>
grenades could make such shows a lot more fun. Imagine, for example, a 
<BR>
small &quot;tank&quot; with a .50 armor-piercing sniper cannon as its primary weapon. 
<BR>
Would make a fine &quot;house robot&quot;, don't you think?
<BR>
<P>They should also let more robots fight each other at the same time, and use 
<BR>
(small) planes and boats as well as land vehicles. Another idea would be to 
<BR>
fit both large and small robots (&quot;AI&quot; or remote-controlled) with paintball 
<BR>
guns (you have full-auto versions, for example), laser tag equipment and/or 
<BR>
stun devices, and let them &quot;hunt&quot; humans, which would be armed with some 
<BR>
kind of non-lethal weapons themselves. Man against machine, the wave of the 
<BR>
future! Put them all in some nice apocalyptic setting (a la _Running Man_) 
<BR>
and let them fight it out. To make things even more interesting, several 
<BR>
(groups of) humans could compete against each other, as well as against 
<BR>
machines.
<BR>
<P>Of course, in the show were hosted in certain non-western regions, you 
<BR>
could use real bullets etc., which would significantly boost its 
<BR>
entertainment value. There are probably thousands of people who would 
<BR>
readily risk their lives to win, say, $1,000,000, and many millions who 
<BR>
would watch the show. It could be broadcast over the Net, for example, to 
<BR>
bypass sanctimonious TV regulations, and of course you could sell videos etc.
<BR>
<P>Everyone wins (well, except those who get killed/injured, obviously): a 
<BR>
poor but persistent/fit/smart person gets a chance to become rich 
<BR>
overnight, the audience gets it kicks, AI researchers get rewarded for 
<BR>
coming up with a &quot;killer&quot; design and the army/police/private security 
<BR>
agencies can use the best models for combat/guard duty etc.
<BR>
<P>To use robots, AI or remote-controlled, as guards (and possibly as rat 
<BR>
catchers etc. as well) in warehouses, factories, prisons, office buildings 
<BR>
or even private residences would be a good idea regardless of the whole 
<BR>
game concept. Even today's primitive AIs already can learn how to outsmart 
<BR>
humans, and beat them every time. The robots could be fitted with a wide 
<BR>
range of camera gear, lethal/nonlethal weapons, fire fighting equipment etc.
<BR>
Superior to human guards in just about any aspect; don't need sleep, don't 
<BR>
have to pay them, never complain about anything, aren't corrupt, lazy, 
<BR>
cowardly or reckless, can be made much tougher (armored) than humans, no 
<BR>
sentimental/legal issues if one gets damaged or destroyed, never get bored 
<BR>
etc. etc. Most burglars are in fact bumbling idiots, and would be easy prey 
<BR>
for a &quot;single-minded&quot; pack of such robots. Sentinel robots have great 
<BR>
commercial potential, IMHO, and are right up the transhuman alley...
