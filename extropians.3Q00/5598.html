<EM>&gt; Maybe it is really time to fire up the text editor to begin with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; architecture outline. Look at packages which adaptively rewrite parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of their source (maybe James Rogers will part with some of his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proprietary magick), at the way they do it, and on their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limitations. Because the system will have to be distributed, and hence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; portable, it is probably a good idea to use Java. Latest compilers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to have reduced the performace gap to just a factor of 2-3. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might want put it up at SourceForge, or keep it closed source,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever makes more sense.

<P>Java?  Eeek!  Why use Java when Lisp is and has been for sometime many
<BR>
times more powerful, faster and the king of AI languages?  If you aren't
<BR>
going to use Lisp then use something better for the purposes at hand. 
<BR>
Java is a seriously limited toy language in comparison.  Why would you
<BR>
cripple an AI and the coding effort and the conceptual space by using
<BR>
such a puny tool?
