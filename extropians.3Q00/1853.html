<EM>&gt;     &gt; U.S. Shoots Down Cruise Missile in Defense Test
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; John Clark wrote:  This has nothing to do with ABM's... I don't know what all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excitement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is about,
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually there wasnt that much excitement about this firing.  Nobody
<BR>
made much to-do about it.  I only heard it in passing: &quot;oh by the way,
<BR>
theres a PAC3 firing tomorrow, but its just a cruise missile...&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for ICBM's, it seems to me that the only hope of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stopping one is to shoot it down during the boost phase,
</EM><BR>
<P>And in fact boost phase deterrence will likely by the second
<BR>
line of defense, the first being diplomacy.  Everyone recognizes
<BR>
the advantages of boost phase intercept strategy.  As you might
<BR>
expect for something so important as stopping a nuclear
<BR>
doomsday, the defense system has may layers.  If the
<BR>
first layer fails (as it has been known to do) the boost phase
<BR>
takes over, then if that fails, the coast phase intercept kicks
<BR>
in, etc.  We keep fighting back all the way to the radioactive
<BR>
bitter end.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...and you don't have to worry about decoys.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well actually we do.  The commies could fire a number of identical decoy
<BR>
rockets simultaneously, and those decoys *really would* be impossible to
<BR>
distinguish from the real one.  If they fire even one at the U.S, they
<BR>
might as well fire everything they have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So if you're really bothered by North Korea's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ICBM's (which the don't have)
</EM><BR>
<P>They dont have *now*.  We are hoping they will stop
<BR>
developing one, so it will take the time pressure off the
<BR>
U.S. to deploy an anti-Korean ICBM system before 2005.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; then just convince China to let you build the ABM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system on the China-Korea  border.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or on the South Korean border.  They might be a bit
<BR>
more open to negotiation than the Chinese.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually I think ICBM's are an obsolete means of delivering a warhead, it's like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spending a lot of money on a anti Zeppelin system, except that system would work.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure but what if we had no way of defeating a Zeppelin?
<BR>
That would become the means of choice for delivering
<BR>
WMDs, would it not?  If we take the long view, the threat
<BR>
of WMDs will never go away until we manage to defeat
<BR>
*every* means of delivery, and no one suggests that will
<BR>
be easy, or that it will happen soon.
<BR>
<P>But do consider this: as we move into the future, more
<BR>
and more of the underdeveloped nations will see our
<BR>
every action as hostile, bullying, etc.  To those nations
<BR>
where people do well to live 50 years, even our discussing
<BR>
radical life extension must be seen as appalling.  Look at
<BR>
some of the stuff we talk about on this list, then try to
<BR>
imagine what this looks like to people whose governments
<BR>
are trying to starve them into submission, but somehow
<BR>
manage to convince the people they are poor because the
<BR>
great satan is gobbling up all the resources.
<BR>
<P>Consider the recent statements by Rwanda: they wanted
<BR>
to sue the U.N. because we *failed* to intervene in their
<BR>
civil war!  They want reparations for that.  What if we
<BR>
*had* intervened?  I guess they would want reparations
<BR>
for that too.  Is it not clear that as time goes on, the more
<BR>
advanced parts of the world, the U.S., Australia, Europe,
<BR>
Japan, etc, will be blamed for *everything*?  And as often
<BR>
happens, the richer and more advanced become still
<BR>
richer and still more advanced.  If we do manage
<BR>
to achieve radical life extension, we will become
<BR>
the object of intense hatred for those who have not even
<BR>
achieved freedom yet.
<BR>
<P>When that day comes, we will need the best negotiators,
<BR>
boost phase intercept, space based laser, airborn laser,
<BR>
brilliant pebbles, THAAD, Navy Theatre Wide, PAC3,
<BR>
universal surveillance, several convents full of fervently
<BR>
praying nuns, and a ton of good luck.  spike
