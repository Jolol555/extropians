I don't know about you guys, but a development like would seem to substantially
<BR>
lessen our odds of making it off this rock.  I can think of several different
<BR>
types of individuals who would have no qualms about developing and releasing
<BR>
something like this:
<BR>
<P>1) Radical Environmentalists - the ones who believe humanity is a virus that
<BR>
needs to be wiped out.
<BR>
<P>2) Terrorist organizations without sufficient foresight to see this will destroy
<BR>
their plans as well.
<BR>
<P>3) Deeply disturbed individuals who became that way because of a personal
<BR>
tragedy - like the character in 'The White Plague'.
<BR>
<P>and finally
<BR>
<P>4) All the other psycho's who don't fit into any of these categories.
<BR>
<P>With the tools to make such nasty viruses getting cheaper all the time, I'd say
<BR>
there at least a 1000 people in the world with the motivation and knowledge to
<BR>
pull something like this off - that would seem to make an outbreak a near
<BR>
certainty.
<BR>
<P>So the golden question is - can we really survive one of these plagues, let
<BR>
alone dozens of them?  And if a few of us did manage to survive, would it
<BR>
matter?  Would there be any modern civilization left?  Would the transhuman
<BR>
ambition become a bygone fantasy no longer capable of being pursued in any
<BR>
practical manner?
