<BR>
<EM>&gt;...  However the reason is that there is an escape clause: anyone can give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up a baby.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No one is forced to keep a child.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where did you get the absolutely dumb idea that 'anyone can give up a baby'
<BR>
...you think babies are sme generic commodity??  Like, anyone can be
<BR>
stripped clean of heritage, ancestry, tribe, relatedness, family,
<BR>
identity...... to be made into a fake someone never born.
<BR>
<P>Everyone born deserves to be wanted, welcomed, loved by their very own
<BR>
mother, (father too). The idea that a mother is replaceable and that babies
<BR>
are interchangable is fundamentally ignorant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;...You can have an abortion any time you want, but you must do it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-destructively.
</EM><BR>
There is no such thing, there is only the least amount of suffering.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The unwanted fetus will be transfered to another womb, perhaps artificial.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In effect you are giving it up for adoption.
</EM><BR>
<P>Adoption? As in, destroying one's identity? The 'civil death' of the
<BR>
mother? No one wants to be a replacement/adoptee, that is, a grateful slave
<BR>
to infertile adopters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Could this be a compromise on the abortion issue acceptable to many parties?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not a chance in Hal. In future, I hope we'll fully recognize the magnitude
<BR>
of genetic ties and the ease and importance of 'uploading' into our own
<BR>
flesh and blood.
<BR>
<P>DNA - You can't adopt it.
