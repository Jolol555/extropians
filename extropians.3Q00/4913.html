At 01:17 PM 13/09/00 -0400, Mike wrote of my comment:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; greater than chance tendency of psychiatrists and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; health professionals to go crazy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; leading to standard jibes about `physician heal thyself'
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I was under the impression that most, or at least many, shrinks go in to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;business as a result of their own mental illness.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's what I just said, dismissing it: standard jibes about `physician
<BR>
heal thyself'. 
<BR>
<P>It might even be true in some measure, in the same way that it might be
<BR>
true surgeons are lightly-disguised sadists with a deep-seated wish to hack
<BR>
and mutilate human flesh. Then again, that claim, while perhaps so in small
<BR>
part, might be a rather silly and cheap Freudianism.
<BR>
<P>But what's interesting about the viral model is that it lacks the jeering,
<BR>
sneering connotations of this sort of suggestion. (I realise that Mike
<BR>
might have been offering it as a simple statement of cause-and-effect, with
<BR>
no added editorializing--but that's not the way it's usually raised.) 
<BR>
<P>I think, along parallel lines, of the cases of teaching members of Xian
<BR>
religious orders who end up fondling their hapless charges, or worse. You
<BR>
could speculate that they entered this supposedly celibate company of men
<BR>
because of their crypto-homosexuality/fear of sex/etc, and then found
<BR>
themselves in pig heaven. It seems to me much more likely that most of the
<BR>
poor sods joined up prior to a full unfolding of their own sexuality, and
<BR>
in this demented social construct found their sexual urges rising to the
<BR>
surface in `deviant' and indeed actually quite repellent ways. In that
<BR>
case, their paedophilic yearnings are presumably neither in-born nor
<BR>
`memetic'; they're a sort of bent adjustment to an intolerable deprivation
<BR>
of warmth and sexual bondedness.  I do doubt, though, in this case, that
<BR>
it's viral. :)
