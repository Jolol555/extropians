<P>We here have ways a person can access the internet from the
<BR>
public library without a scrap of personal identification.  So
<BR>
lets go ahead and recognize that the current level of our
<BR>
society's opacity allows people to post on the internet
<BR>
without the slightest fear of repercussions.
<BR>
<P>Let us look at how such a situation could be used as a
<BR>
political tool or weapon.  Suppose someone hated both the
<BR>
extropians and posthumanists, for instance, and wanted
<BR>
to see both groups vitiated.  This could be accomplished
<BR>
by getting each to use up their energies and creativity trying
<BR>
to tear down the other.  This would create a most pleasing
<BR>
and amusing situation to political opponents, would it not?
<BR>
<P>I can imagine any number of groups that would try to
<BR>
accomplish something like this by tossing a meme-bomb such
<BR>
as yesterday's misadventure:  fundy christian groups,
<BR>
scientologists, ultragreen terrorists, etc.
<BR>
<P>Allow me to add my support to those who have suggested
<BR>
filtering posts from any anonymous remailer.  This would
<BR>
filter out the meme-bombing while still allowing newbies,
<BR>
outsiders and non-members to post.  I suppose it is another
<BR>
step towards greater transparency, but of course Ive no
<BR>
problem with that.  {8^D  spike
