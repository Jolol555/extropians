<P><EM>&gt;we do have one noncopyright strategy; publish work that's important

<EM>&gt;enough and maybe someone will pay you to keep doing it.

<P>Hmm. This might apply to the odd mutant supergenius programmer, but doesn't
<BR>
port well to many artists. I seem to recall Brian Atkins explicitly
<BR>
suggesting that artists ought to go seek out wealthy patrons. (I might have
<BR>
the ascription wrong.) Clearly, the history of painting and sculpture in
<BR>
the 20th century (and most of the preceding epochs a fortiori) is a tally
<BR>
of initially unpopular work funded by rich connoisseurs. I've never heard
<BR>
of this working for novelists, although some poets might get away with it.
<BR>
*Institutional* patronage and elite awards, of course, support a large part
<BR>
of highbrow art of all kinds. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Damien Broderick is fortunate and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*rare* in being able to make a living at skiffy (sci-fi)
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha! &lt; quiet choking sounds &gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;the very existence of SF magazines 
</EM><BR>
<P>Which appear to be on the way out; certainly their print runs are shrinking
<BR>
at a shocking rate, something like 20 percent a year I seem to recall.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Writing short stories doesn't pay - 
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course it does. 5 cents a word or more, isn't it? $375 for a 7500
<BR>
worder. True, it doesn't pay *much*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;writing novels does 
</EM><BR>
<P>For anyone less than a bestseller, $7500 for a 150,000 word novel, average
<BR>
length by today's bloated standards, would not be especially low. Besides,
<BR>
plenty of sf novels (at any rate) are `fix-ups' - compiled from shorter
<BR>
linked stories, most previously published.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; just pointing out that your empirical evidence is not especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; representative of the way most artists need to make a living from their
</EM><BR>
work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yes, I believe I said as much in my original message (&quot;you can't run an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;industry that way&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<P>You *can* run an *industry* by ripping off (in a financial sense) the work
<BR>
of people who are weirdly skewed toward wanting to produce creative work,
<BR>
or by publishing out-of-copyright classics, etc. You just can't easily run
<BR>
a *life* that way if you're one of the sheep begging to be shorn.
