<P><EM>&gt; We are consistently losing the battle for public opinion.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll cite an interesting example.  I was in London last week and
<BR>
went out to diner with friends.  On the menu were several &quot;organic&quot;
<BR>
selections, e.g. &quot;organic salmon&quot;.  After some comments on my part
<BR>
(&quot;Oh, a restaurant that supplies more expensive food for no rational
<BR>
reason...&quot;) a discussion ensued as to exactly *what* &quot;organic salmon&quot;
<BR>
could be.  This turns out to be salmon grown on farms using &quot;organic&quot;
<BR>
methods (organic food???).  I can't imagine anything less &quot;natural&quot;
<BR>
given the fact that wild salmon presumably mature on a diet of &quot;raw&quot; meat.
<BR>
Now, one could argue that given the chemical residues in (wild) fatty fish
<BR>
that the &quot;organic&quot; salmon were healthier than the wild form.  (Of
<BR>
course the carcinogenic potential of even highly chemically polluted
<BR>
wild salmon is significantly less than that of the wine we were
<BR>
consuming with diner but that is another discussion...)
<BR>
<P>The interesting thing was the assumption by several college educated,
<BR>
moderately techno-literate (American) people at diner that the &quot;organic&quot;
<BR>
kind, &quot;had&quot; to be healthier for you.  So Greg is correct in that the
<BR>
horse is out of the barn and is slowly eating the grass in our yards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Genetic engineering technologies are advancing WAY faster than its 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proponents are realizing, in an important sense -- and that sense is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public at large's acceptance of the technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  This seems like a contradiction.  Do you mean &quot;lack of acceptance&quot;?
<BR>
<P>At any rate, the technologies are advancing and it looks like in
<BR>
western societies there will be an interesting quandry developing.
<BR>
As I've pointed out before it looks like there may be a lack of
<BR>
acceptance for AgBio since it has little impact on our actual health
<BR>
or pocketbooks.  In contrast progress on the MedBio front is continuing
<BR>
at a blistering pace.  I simply cannot see the most green Green saying
<BR>
&quot;No, you can't use that angiogenesis inhibitor anti-cancer drug on
<BR>
my mother because its produced using biotech...&quot;.  So sooner or later
<BR>
the greens are going to have to confront the good biotech/bad biotech
<BR>
conundrum.
<BR>
<P>If the animal rights activists (a separate group from the greens, but
<BR>
at times similarly irrational), had their act together, they would
<BR>
be demonstrating loudly against all of the transgenic mice activities,
<BR>
particularly any plans to knock-out all of the genes in mice or zebrafish
<BR>
(some small fraction of those knockouts are presumably not going to live
<BR>
pleasant lives).  They don't seem to be doing much of that yet, so I
<BR>
consider most of their efforts noise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The luddites are well organized, have a simple, consistent theme and are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting better and better at getting themselves insserted into every single 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; news item announcing any progress.  I'm sorry to say it, but as someone who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works in the arena of public persuasion, I have to say we're losing -- and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; badly.
</EM><BR>
<P>You make the case that they are inserting bad memes into public minds.
<BR>
Can you make the case that the attention or actions they are taking is
<BR>
significantly slowing down progress?
<BR>
<P>If annually there is $70 Billion in VC, some fraction of which (1-5%) has
<BR>
to flow into healthcare/biotech, and more than $15 billion each in both NIH
<BR>
and Pharma research -- how can the greens &amp; warm-n-fuzzy animal people
<BR>
hope to compete with that?
<BR>
<P>I kind of liked the article re: &quot;low mow&quot; and/or glowing grass.
<BR>
Its an example of what the average person can see as being useful
<BR>
for themselves that no amount of green politicing will offset.
<BR>
The glowing grass is particularly &quot;green&quot; as it would allow the
<BR>
grass to store solar energy and release it at night allowing
<BR>
people to reduce outdoor lighting leading to reductions in
<BR>
power plant CO2 emissions.  Of course the astronomers may not
<BR>
be happy due to the light pollution.
<BR>
<P>Regarding going off to Minnesota and standing in front of the
<BR>
activists, I'm not sure I can see myself doing it.  What would
<BR>
I do -- hold up a big sign that says &quot;Go Biotech&quot;???
<BR>
<P>It seems what ExI should do is write a position statement on the
<BR>
advantages of Biotech and GeneEng to offset the Green/AnimalRights
<BR>
position and publish it on the web site.  Then we should make sure that
<BR>
reporters at the major papers know how to contact us for pithy 
<BR>
comments about how ill-conceived the positions of the demonstrators are.
<BR>
<P>The reporters are just doing their job (documenting newsworthy
<BR>
controversy that sells papers) -- we should assist them in that area.
<BR>
<P>We aren't just standing by twiddling our thumbs, I finished my BBC
<BR>
interview last week, and the reporter hopes to catch Nick &amp; Anders
<BR>
in a few weeks.  Unfortunately, the show doesn't air until next year
<BR>
and is more about nanotech &amp; uploads than biotech.  But we are making
<BR>
progress.
