<EM>&gt; &gt;The one thing you can never, ever do is condescend to your audience.  Do so,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and you lose the empathy that lets you communicate effectively; you lose the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ability to transfer thoughts from yourself to the audience, and are left with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;nothing but a few lifeless tricks of propaganda.
</EM><BR>
<P>Problem: how can we tell when we're condescending?  The fact of the
<BR>
matter is that we *do* know more about this than most people; that's why
<BR>
we're discussing it.  How do we get people to know as much as we do,
<BR>
without rubbing in their faces that we know more (or otherwise
<BR>
condescending)?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One must also remember that the &quot;masses&quot; are comprised of individuals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any appeal to them must acknowledge that fact, and both address and be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tailored to (each of) them as the individuals that they are.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaders include the individuals as a subclass; if we can get them on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; board, the herdish followers will do what they do best, the only thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they know how to do, and follow.
</EM><BR>
<P>Problem: this is almost a contradiction.  If we appeal straight to the
<BR>
leaders, then our actions advertise that we view the followers as
<BR>
sheeple, rather than individuals.
<BR>
<P>Partial solution: make sure to craft the appeal to the leader in such a
<BR>
way that the leader can regurgitate to the masses, so as to advertise
<BR>
that we really do want to tell everyone and we're just being efficient
<BR>
about it (and/or going through trusted channels, so that their
<BR>
information can be pre-judged in the way they want).
