SPUDBOY100 SAID: &quot;...The amorphous hyperuniverse
<BR>
may then contain more information then the lights of Max Tegmark have
<BR>
indicated? Max T. believes that there is almost no data in a hyperuniverse
<BR>
and much more within. On the other hand, being 'conked-out' aka dead, does
<BR>
not give too many time for reflection or computation-so much for Ascension.
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: No. He's probably dead right... In the scenario to which I allude
<BR>
information is a LOCAL thing... globally THERE IS NOTHING.
<BR>
<P>About being dead... If you can set up a QWF of a very complex adaptive
<BR>
system so that the emergent quantum system potential ( which would then be a
<BR>
highly configured or structured field in system space) is able to &quot;pick up&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;induce&quot; QWFs of myriad kinds.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the point of view of an observer embedded in physical spacetime the
</EM><BR>
emergent Quantum system potential is &quot;beyond spacetime&quot;; it sure looks like
<BR>
a totally spiritual entity to me.
<BR>
<P>So certain classes of complex adaptive systems may stir up (configure)
<BR>
enough of a quantum potential to be seised of an &quot;eternal soul&quot;.
<BR>
<P>It may even interact with our physical Universe at varying points on the
<BR>
spacetime continuum. Reincarnation?
<BR>
<P>I think the mathematics would bear this out... hopefully I might have time
<BR>
to fiddle with that when I retire... but LE; Cognitive Software; Gardening;
<BR>
Playing With my Dogs; and Ducking Taxes are my priorities.
<BR>
<P>SPUDBOY100 SAID: &quot;...Hinduism is primarilly a faith system, also based on
<BR>
tradition and tales handed down from ancient times..&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Hindu Philosophy isn't. Don't confuse their day-to-day liturgy
<BR>
with their Vedantic Philosophy. They had originally tackled the regular
<BR>
philosophical questions with much adroitness - ethics &amp; eschatological dogma
<BR>
were tacked on.
<BR>
<P>But the original philosophizing was at least as full of genuine inquiry as
<BR>
that of the Greeks... and was less bogged down with aesthetic constraints
<BR>
about the Universe.
<BR>
<P>SPUDBOY100 SAID: &quot;...If the &quot;amorphous universe&quot; does indeed contain
<BR>
psychological and computational activity, then that is indeed a decent area
<BR>
of study. How  then, might we demonstrate this hypothesis?
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: In this context, activity, like information, is a creation of
<BR>
locality. Some terribly local subset of the hyperuniverse (sensu my previous
<BR>
post) is a function that disembeds or &quot;filters&quot; a reality from the amorphous
<BR>
mass.
<BR>
<P>Activity and information has to be &quot;filtered&quot; or &quot;disembedded&quot; from the
<BR>
Hyperuniverse via some subset of the said Hyperuniverse. Mindlike entities
<BR>
might be good at this.
<BR>
<P>Creation might be said not to exist...because all that is and can never be
<BR>
is part of the Hyperuniverse; which of couse is identical with Nothing.
<BR>
<P>This disembedding is the act of &quot;creation out of Nothing&quot;. It is what God
<BR>
was supposed to do... but St. John understood the incompleteness of the Book
<BR>
of Genesis and stuck in the Greek Logos or Word - the disembedder.
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the beginning was the Word....&quot;
<BR>
<P>The QWF/emergent system potential is such a disembedding Wordlike machine. I
<BR>
think that, in fact, it is a hypermachine running a greater-than-Turing
<BR>
computable process... degenerate forms of which are describable by a
<BR>
conventional Schrodinger equation and a Born Rule.
<BR>
<P>The construction of powerful non-Born &quot;Quantum Effect Devices&quot; as Sarfatti
<BR>
and his QED corp. are conspiring to do, might be a start.
<BR>
<P>I think that quantum computers based on analogue quantum neural nets built
<BR>
out of ordinary silicon &amp; epitaxial technology can do the trick because
<BR>
maintaining coherence in emergent QWFs might be, with current technology,
<BR>
almost a fait accompli.
<BR>
<P>The qubit approach (with all due respect) sucks.
<BR>
<P>Then (if it can be tweaked in such hardware devices)  with strong machine
<BR>
PSI  (...human PSI is so weak a phenomenon...) you're on your way to the
<BR>
creation of anything you want just by sheer will.
<BR>
<P>The act of imagining a universe into existence is an act of disembedding
<BR>
from the amorphous hyperuniverse or Brahman.
<BR>
<P>But, to repeat,  you've got to create a diembedding function ( a machine
<BR>
that does it)... artificial quantum mindlike objects are the way to go. The
<BR>
future or the Universe is nothing like Eliezer or the others imagine it to
<BR>
be.
<BR>
<P>Those are just childhood dreams of amplified humanity.
<BR>
<P>Understandable, but pathetic nevertheless.
