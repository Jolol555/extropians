<EM>&gt; &gt; writes:  &lt;&lt; Okay, but you started off with this stuff about being created by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; God  who gave us rights. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Given that we know the Washington, Jefferson and many others were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somewhat indifferent to organized religion was that phrasing literal or just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exhoratory?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My point was that we should respect the reasoning of Washington,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jefferson, etc. only if it makes sense to us.  Just because they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great Men whom we were taught to worship in state-sponsored schools is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no reason to give special credence to what they say.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Forrest began by writing, &quot;The reason for an armed populace is very,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very fundamental:&quot; and then he quoted the Declaration of Independence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which starts off by talking about God and how our rights come from him.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again Hal, you are reading into it. It does not say 'god' it says 'creator'. It
<BR>
is you who are equating the two.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why should we, who by and large reject theism, pay attention to a document
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has this as the foundation?  Whatever the authors thought about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God and organized religion, if they base their theory of natural rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the principle that we are endowed with them by our Creator with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capital C, they aren't going to convince me.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is your creator?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If someone wants to advance the idea that owning weapons is beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it makes it harder for organized groups to impose their will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on individuals, that's fine.  But quoting Jefferson isn't productive,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least not in this forum, at least not for me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why, because he's not politically correct any more? Because he is considered to
<BR>
be the 'first libertarian', its rather obvious why the media and the left would
<BR>
need to smear his name on both sides of the aisle, with the fact that he kept
<BR>
slaves, and kept his own children as slaves when they were born to slaves, to be
<BR>
some sort of evil thing to abhorred by freedom lovers, while promoting the fact
<BR>
he had a love affair with his slave and had children by her as a means to get
<BR>
more bigoted right wing people disliking him. Its been a rather well crafted
<BR>
propaganda campaign, I must admit, because it alienates him with many groups
<BR>
across the board, and disparages anything else he ever did or said by its smear
<BR>
of his person. Hal certainly has bought into it.
