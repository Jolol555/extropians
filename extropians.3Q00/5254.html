<P>
It is commonly held that we ought to try to choose careers and
<BR>
lifestyles which make us happy, rather than those which are
<BR>
productive.  That is, if you give me the choice between Door #1,
<BR>
behind which lies a happy life, but also a less important, less
<BR>
productive, less useful life, and Door #2, behind which lies a
<BR>
considerably less happy but considerably more important, productive,
<BR>
and useful life, I ought to choose Door #1.
<BR>
<P>[For now, I'll assume that such a choice actually exists and is a
<BR>
relevant decision.  The argument that &quot;happiness makes you more
<BR>
productive&quot; is a point well taken.  Nonetheless I assume that, despite
<BR>
the fact that happiness can make you more productive, sometimes there
<BR>
is a (potentially rather large) tradeoff between happiness and
<BR>
productivity.]
<BR>
<P>The argument for choosing a happier life over a more productive life
<BR>
makes a great deal of sense in the face of impending mortality.
<BR>
You're bound to die eventually, the argument goes, so you might as
<BR>
well get as much out of life as you can before that happens.
<BR>
Productivity, it might be argued, is only there so as to bring about
<BR>
happiness; if you spend your whole life being productive, you may
<BR>
never get around to being happy.
<BR>
<P>This argument, as I say, is certainly right if I'm going to die.  But
<BR>
what if I'm not?  What arguments might I bring to bear if I know that
<BR>
there's a chance that I'll live?
<BR>
<P>Or, to make the choice more difficult, what if I'm more likely to live
<BR>
by choosing productivity over happiness?
<BR>
<P>Clearly, if I set the imaginary payoffs of my imaginary Doors just
<BR>
right, choosing productivity behind Door #2 over happiness behind Door
<BR>
#1 might not only be a good idea, it might be downright irrational to
<BR>
the point of stupidity to choose today's happiness in exchange for the
<BR>
free time of an eternity.
<BR>
<P>Though I have begun this question (perhaps) unnecessarily
<BR>
theoretically, I ask for rather concrete reasons: I'm graduating from
<BR>
Yale this year.  I'm a biomedical engineering / philosophy double
<BR>
major.  There are a number of potential career opportunities before
<BR>
me, some of which, it seems to me, would make me substantially more
<BR>
likely to survive than others; unfortunately, it also appears to me
<BR>
that the career opportunities which have the potential for reaping me
<BR>
the most happiness right now are not the opportunities which maximize
<BR>
my fitness.
<BR>
<P>This leaves me wondering: is there really a tradeoff between happiness
<BR>
and productivity?  Just how important is it that I tradeoff happiness
<BR>
for productivity right now and in the years ahead?  Just how likely is
<BR>
it that I'll make it?  How does a 21st century fellow go about living
<BR>
a good life?
<BR>
