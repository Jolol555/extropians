<EM>&gt;&gt; To be honest, these folks don't KNOW they  need it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and often they *like* themselves the way they are... so *someone*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; has to take them in and get them started, because they haven't the mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; faculties to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; it themselves!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It makes me uncomfortable to think that if I happen to be sitting out on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a curb looking weird and unkempt I could be forcibly picked up and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;injected with psychoactive drugs.  So there are people who like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves as they are, are happy as they are, and are not hurting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyone.. (You know what?  This is more than I can say for a lot of  solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citizens. )
</EM><BR>
<P>It makes me uncomfortable too.
<BR>
<P>Let's further this discussion because there's a lot of issues
<BR>
involved. I think that this is a good arena to think creatively of
<BR>
some solutions that lie between the &quot;forcibly picked up&quot; route, and
<BR>
the &quot;leave them alone&quot; route.
<BR>
<P>Let's assume that that person is acting and talking in ways that are
<BR>
&quot;harmful&quot; (huge spectrum of meaning from harrassment and verbal
<BR>
abuse to others, destroying one's own life goals, etc.), and at the
<BR>
same time that person: 1) is convinced that they are perfectly fine
<BR>
(as Nadia says: they *like* themselves the way they are), and 2) are
<BR>
good at convincing any social worker or neighborhood policeperson
<BR>
that they are fine.
<BR>
<P>If you are unsuccessful at convincing them to voluntarily admit
<BR>
themselves to a hospital/institution, then, today, there is very
<BR>
little that one can do. You would have to petition the courts, in
<BR>
order to have the person put in a hospital, and it's often a messy
<BR>
and long process.  If the police stepped in and determined that the
<BR>
ill person is a danger to himself/herself or others, then that person is
<BR>
put in jail.  Next, a psychiatric evaluation is performed and that
<BR>
person is held for a few days.  If the person is determined to be
<BR>
ok, then he/she is put back on the streets.  If not, then he/she is
<BR>
put in the hospital.
<BR>
<P>It might be better for the ill person and the family members/friends
<BR>
if the involuntary committment process could be changed so that
<BR>
friends and family members are given a larger role and the
<BR>
random-ignorant-policeperson given a smaller role. That might might
<BR>
make the process less vulnerable to mistakes or to overzealous
<BR>
actions by single individuals. For example, if, 3 family members and
<BR>
3 friends/colleagues/neighbors could give statements about the
<BR>
mental state of ill person, then perhaps the committment process
<BR>
would be quicker and less cumbersome. And if the forced hospital
<BR>
stay was just a few days (until other tests and evaluations
<BR>
determined that more time was needed), instead of weeks (with that
<BR>
person being lost in the beaucratic maze), then less mistakes might
<BR>
be made too. Any solution that weighs in favor of (&quot;individually
<BR>
adapted to&quot;) the ill person's local environment would be better than
<BR>
all-encompassing laws and mandates.
<BR>
<P>Another issue involved here is what constitutes an &quot;mental illness&quot;.
<BR>
In the 1960s a well-known libertarian and psychoanalyst named Thomaz
<BR>
Szaz held that mental ilness was a social constract rather than a
<BR>
symptom of disease. (_The Myth of Mental Illness_) His view was that
<BR>
the mentally ill person is expressing their difficulty with a
<BR>
situation in their own life, in their &quot;own language&quot;, which might or
<BR>
might not be understandable by any other person around. His theory
<BR>
was widely circulated, and is discarded now. As much as I respect
<BR>
Szaz for his other opinions and ideas, and I offer that he may have
<BR>
explanations for some of what he's seen in the psychiatry field,
<BR>
he's wrong in big ways with some of the diagnosed mental illnesses.
<BR>
For example, the evidence that schizophrenia is a brain disease is
<BR>
overwhelming.
<BR>
<P>Probably most people here (including myself) would cringe at the
<BR>
idea of &quot;forced 'anything'&quot;, but in the situation of a person with
<BR>
an acute mental illness (such as schizophrenia), the benefit to the
<BR>
person and friend/family is overwhelmingly large. The
<BR>
hospitalization accomplishes several things. It enables the health
<BR>
professionals to observe the person in a controlled setting, so that
<BR>
other medical illnesses, that might be causing the symptoms can be
<BR>
ruled out. If medication is started, then the medical staff can
<BR>
watch for side effects. Also the hospital stay offers the family and
<BR>
friends a brief rest from what is often extremely stressful and
<BR>
harrowing days/nights leading up to the ill person's hospital stay.
<BR>
<P>I know that it's dangerous when oppressive governments see mental
<BR>
institutions as a convenient tool with which to supress
<BR>
&quot;indesirable&quot; voices in the population. The former Soviet Union was
<BR>
probably best known for using mental institutions this way. Because
<BR>
the concept of forced institutionalism is such an fragile (and
<BR>
emotional and dangerous) concept, it's a perfect example for
<BR>
libertarians and anarchists to think about and address in order to be
<BR>
prepared for the future when we have more minimal government (call
<BR>
me an optimist).
<BR>
<P>To close this note, some of you may or may not know that John Forbes
<BR>
Nash, Jr., the mathematical genius and winner of the Nobel Prize in
<BR>
Economics (1994, for work in &quot;Game Theory&quot;) was a paranoid
<BR>
schizophrenic for about 30-40 years of his life. He received his
<BR>
Nobel prize when he was approaching age 70, for work that he did in
<BR>
his 20s and 30s, with long periods of his illness in-between. He
<BR>
benefited from early traditional antipsychotic drugs (and he refused
<BR>
any drugs after 1970), but for him, it was an episodic illness, with
<BR>
periods of acute psychosis followed by periods of relative calm when
<BR>
the symptoms diminished dramatically. He was involuntarily committed
<BR>
several times by family members or colleagues, he never voluntarily
<BR>
went to the hospital. I wonder alot what his life would have
<BR>
been like if he was not been involuntarily committed to those institutions
<BR>
by the people who cared about him. His years from age ~60 show his
<BR>
illness in a dramatic remission and  his colleagues call him &quot;recovered&quot;.
<BR>
He is perhaps, one of the rare schizophrenic cases that goes into
<BR>
remission. (The initial diagnosis by doctors of his illness can be
<BR>
trusted.) He believes that he willed his own recovery: &quot;Gradually I
<BR>
began to intellectually reject some of the delusionally influenced
<BR>
lines of thinking which had been characteristic of my orientation.
<BR>
This began, most recognizably, with the rejection of
<BR>
politically-oriented thinking as essentially a hopeless waste of
<BR>
intellectual effort.&quot; The book: _A Beautiful Mind_ by Sylvia Nasar
<BR>
is a really nice story about his life.
