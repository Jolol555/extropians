<EM>&gt;John, no offense, but that is a really lousy idea.  It would defeat &gt;the purpose of the entire exercise.  And would you stop changing the

<EM>&gt;bleeding subject lines?
</EM><BR>
<P>I was just putting out some food for thought.  I was simply a little shocked at the idea of you changing your name.  It's a big decision and I wish you luck with it.  
<BR>
<P>I agree with others that an unusual name can have a strength, catchiness and charm that a &quot;mundane&quot; name just won't have.  Again, it is your choice.  I thought Max, Natasha and John gave good counsel on the matter.
<BR>
<P>I do feel changing a subject line can be good now and than.  So often the subject lines stay the same while the actual topic veers all over the place! lol  I realize many people like subject lines to stay the same for the sake of sorting things for their files.
<BR>
<P>best of luck to you,
