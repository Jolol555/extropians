<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So I set about at age 15 to induce &amp; train the hallucinatory modalities. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;started via the hypnagogic &amp; hypnopompic states that border sleep.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Within 3 weeks I could induce such states ...and cultivate auditory &amp; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;visual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hallucinations while awake but relaxed. Extremely lucid dreaming came my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way... if I were religious... I could well imagine that my experiences 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compare in depth with Joan of Arc's or the Fatima trio.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I had a similar experience.  In college in the late '60's, I worked as a 
<BR>
night watchman at dorms.  To stay awake, I resorted to diet pills - 
<BR>
dexadrine mainly.  I would be SO tired, however, that often I would fall 
<BR>
into a dream that was identical - at first - to the reality of the lobby 
<BR>
where I sat alone with my texts.  Then, shortly, I would hear a knock at the 
<BR>
door or people would appear and I would find myself in a full-fledged dream 
<BR>
and realize that it was a dream, at which point the problem was how to wake 
<BR>
up.  I found that the only thing I could actually control was my breathing, 
<BR>
and that by increasing my breathing wake sufficiently, I could force myself 
<BR>
awake.
<BR>
<P>However, it seemed obvious that what I was experiencing was what the more 
<BR>
credulous called &quot;astral projection.&quot;  I became curious as to what kind of 
<BR>
capabilities existed for using this lucid dreaming to examine reality itself 
<BR>
- and also what kind of recreational possibilities...  So, for a while, I 
<BR>
did the same thing you did, at my leizure training myself to go into these 
<BR>
states.  I found one thing that I couldn't do, BTW, while in one of these 
<BR>
lucid dreams.  I couldn't turn around and look at myself.  It seemed to take 
<BR>
an infinite amount of will.  I could get to the point of seeing my feet, and 
<BR>
no further.
<BR>
<P>Once I stopped - for the same reason, lack of time - they didn't stay with 
<BR>
me, however.  Wonder why they stayed in your case?
