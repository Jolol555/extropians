<EM>&gt;it really isn't really a religion or cult. I say this because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;religious groups usually take themselves very seriously.

<P>I guess it depends upon how narrowly you define &quot;the religion&quot; per se.
<BR>
I know several devout catholics, for example, who *love* to tell
<BR>
catholic jokes.  These are not cynical catholics, the ones who are only
<BR>
catholic-by-association.  My former office mate, for example, just
<BR>
finished a first-rate Ph.D. in discrete mathematics and computer
<BR>
science.  He's also a devout catholic.  He doesn't take the bible
<BR>
literally, of course.  He's intelligent, informed, and a wonderful
<BR>
debater.  We often discussed religion in the office.  (I don't
<BR>
subscribe to any of the recognized organized religions.)  It was
<BR>
*fun*.  But I digress.
<BR>
<P>The point is that this guy, who devoutly believed in God and the
<BR>
Catholic church, told me some of the *best* religious jokes I've ever
<BR>
heard---including jokes against Catholics and the Catholic Church.  And
<BR>
if the Roman Catholic Church isn't a &quot;serious&quot; religion, I don't know
<BR>
what is.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the jokes were good.  :-)
