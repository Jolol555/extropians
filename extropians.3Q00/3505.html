<EM>&gt; &gt; What do we mean by &quot;brainpower&quot;?

<EM>&gt; Primarily, I think the term refers to the ability to solve problems or answer

<EM>&gt; questions.

<P>It is very difficult to pass these concepts out to the public while maintaining
<BR>
the vital context.  To have the power to solve complex problems we need a
<BR>
combination of processing units, and an effective arrangement of such units.
<BR>
Back in the 50's people observed that it was unreasonable to expect to build a
<BR>
computer out of millions of vacuum tubes (the basic units of processing) to rival
<BR>
the human brain, even if only a tiny fraction of the neurons of the brain were
<BR>
needed to do thinking.  This is a strong argument, even though it does not really
<BR>
prove anything.  It may be possible to reproduce the problem solving power of the
<BR>
brain with just the right arrangement of vastly fewer processing units.
<BR>
<P>As time has gone on, the number of artificial processing units has grown
<BR>
exponentially.  At the same time, biologists have found vastly more cellular
<BR>
processing activity.  The point of all this is not to say that when the
<BR>
artificial processing capability exceeds the cellular processing capability we
<BR>
will have intelligent machines, but rather, that at that point the &quot;we will never
<BR>
have an equivalent number of vacuum tubes&quot; argument goes away.  This is the
<BR>
removal of a negative, not necessarily the demonstration of a positive.
<BR>
<P>Although we want to jump to the ultimate conclusion, what Moravec is actually
<BR>
saying is that the extrapolations of the trends show that soon you will have one
<BR>
less reason for calling his work &quot;unreasonable.&quot;  It does not say anything about
<BR>
when we will, or will not, have intelligent machines.
