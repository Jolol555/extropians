<P>Maybe &quot;figures&quot; would be better, or something else.  I had difficulty when
<BR>
wanting to include Raquel Welch and the &quot;thinkers&quot; didn't apply.  However,
<BR>
she is very bright (she often acts as her own attorney), but this is not
<BR>
why I wanted to include her.  It is because she has defied the myth about
<BR>
beauty and age as has several other pioneering sex symbols.  And, her book
<BR>
on Yoga is excellent - we worked out together in Yoga, so I know she walks
<BR>
her walk.   I definitely don't want only scientists and technologists!!
<BR>
This is most important.  I'm trying to wake up the mainstream about
<BR>
superlongevity and the best way to do it is to combine scientific advocates
<BR>
with cultural communicators.
<BR>
<P>Good catch Damien.  Max just suggested the &quot;figures.&quot;  I'll toss it around
<BR>
and see how it comes together.  Maybe the best (working) title subtitle for
<BR>
it is just to use &quot;Cracking Myths of Mortality.&quot;
<BR>
<P>best,
<BR>
