People comparing duplication to theft
<BR>
<EM>&gt; are plain wrong.  If I were to steel your car,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would be theft.  After all it would cost you a substantial amount
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of money to replace it.  But what if I gained the ability to duplicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your car at no cost to you?  This would not be theft, because quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply your car would still be there!  Yet this argument fails to sway,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because those in power have managed so far to use fictitious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual property ideas to make money off of information.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, actually this argument fails to sway because it defines theft in very
<BR>
simplistic terms.  You might not be stealing my music if you copy it, but
<BR>
you certainly are stealing my profit.  If you desire something that I have
<BR>
spent energy producing, then it is clear that we should come to some
<BR>
arrangement by which I should end up with something that you have spent
<BR>
energy producing (like, er, money for instance.)
<BR>
<P>By your argument, it should be legal to counterfeit money.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Understandably this was done in an era when duplication costs were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high.  Now that costs of duplication have fallen close to zero,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual property arguments are loosing their strength.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, why even bother with intellectual property laws if something is really
<BR>
hard to duplicate?  Intellectual property laws -gain- relevance as a
<BR>
particular thing becomes easier to copy.  In fact, intellectual property
<BR>
laws protect... intellectual property, which by definition, has always been
<BR>
tremendously easy to duplicate.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which brings us to the crux of the issue -  intellectual propertarians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fear that cheap duplication threatens their ability to make money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly, and they better get used to it!  That's the nature of advancing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology.  Their argument is the same as blacksmiths during the 1920's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complaining that the proliferation of the automobile was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; putting them out of business, or typists when the copy machine came into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; widespread use.  The only difference here is blacksmiths and typists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weren't a very powerful lobby.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, actually, the real difference here is that blacksmiths were being
<BR>
replaced by something that did their job better.  That's called progress.
<BR>
No one has proven that Napster is going to result in better music or that
<BR>
the removal of copyright is going to result in better drugs, coca-cola,
<BR>
filmmaking, literature, automobile design, etc.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Their next line of argument is the claim that without financial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incentives made possible by intellectual property protections, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overall level of creativity will suffer.  This is the most bogus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument of all.  Can anyone say Linux?!
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, Linux is not the only example of something really cool that people have
<BR>
made without getting paid for it.  There will likely continue to be many
<BR>
shining examples of what humans will do for free.  And humans will continue
<BR>
to do really interesting things for free.
<BR>
<P>Its just that they still have to spend a lot of their time doing things they
<BR>
get paid for.
<BR>
<P>And just because an operating system is better when lots of people can get
<BR>
in there and move things around doesn't mean that, oh, say, a movie will be
<BR>
better if lots of people can get in there and move things around.
