<EM>&gt; &gt; Are animals as legitimate an artform as orchids and rainbow corn?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would question &quot;orchids and rainbow corn&quot; as forms of art.  What seems
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be lost in this question is the distinction between [fine] art and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decoration.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Where are the ethical boundaries?  What are the ethical considerations?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What would you create?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have concerns about using any conscious life form -- which I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rabbits are -- for such experiments, especially in this case where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit is pure entertainment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cheers!

<P>I think the bunny is a very good idea, and counts as art.
<BR>
<P>That artist is attempting to bring the issues of genetic modification to the
<BR>
fore. He's saying This is really happening. Right now. Look, a glowing
<BR>
bunny. Deal with it.
<BR>
<P>All sorts of extra concepts come with this. Like, for instance, one
<BR>
immediately imagines GM pets in general. It can happen right now. Deal with
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>And, for a frankenstein bunny, it's pretty cute. It's got a positive aspect;
<BR>
the bunny isn't a malformed monster which will devour the world, it's a cute
<BR>
little regular bunny which happens to be phosporescent (yowsa). So there is
<BR>
some comment about genetic modification not being automatically evil. Just
<BR>
because it can't occur &quot;naturally&quot;, doesn't mean it is bad.
<BR>
<P>So yes, I think this has been entirely justifiable as a form of art. As
<BR>
ever, the ethical boundaries are something like, yes, you can do this for
<BR>
art, but it's got to be good art. There's the problem...
