<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But never fear, I'm sure there will always be something for you to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your money on in order to get the sort of exclusivity you're after.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I'm not interested.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think it's cool that you're not interested-- obviously each of us is free
<BR>
to ascribe value to things by whatever criteria we choose.  However
<BR>
exclusivity -does- hold tremendous value for lots of people other than you,
<BR>
and as a result, motivates them to contribute to achieve it.
<BR>
<P>I'll grant that exclusivity can be extremely arbitrary-- but I fail to see
<BR>
how that's even a factor.  I am, in fact, in favor of 'artificial'
<BR>
conventions that create interesting markets-- but that's because I don't
<BR>
really believe in the word artificial.  (Ok, that's probably another
<BR>
conversation.)
<BR>
<P>The fact of the matter is that one tends to automatically take for granted
<BR>
those things that are plentiful and easy to achieve.  You personally may be
<BR>
in favor of more free stuff, but I am a really ambitious person... and I am
<BR>
interested in very exclusive, very difficult to achieve goals.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If something only holds value for you because it serves as a status
</EM><BR>
symbol,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; showing that *you* can afford goodies that are unattainable to the lumpen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; masses, that's fine.  For me, I appreciate things for the use I can make
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; them, regardless of the cost.  I suppose you are the kind of person who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would rather pay for a web browser like Opera, than get a more powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program like MSIE for free.  Not so for me.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>God, you make it sound like humans would have made it this far without bait.
<BR>
<P>What frightens me most about the sort of future you want is its apparent
<BR>
desire to eliminate the positive feedback loops that have driven our species
<BR>
for so many years.  It doesn't bother me at all that there are lots of young
<BR>
people out there hungry for status, or money, or recognition, or fame or
<BR>
whatever.  I happen to be tremendously ambitious myself--  I'm simply not
<BR>
going to be content under those circumstances.
<BR>
<P>And, yes, I -do- seek status.  In fact, I'm looking for massive recognition.
<BR>
I'm an artist and I'm hungry for an audience.  I love creating interesting
<BR>
experiences for people.  I get a warm glow in my stomach when someone says
<BR>
something really nice about my work.  Fame is good too.  It's a good
<BR>
currency to have on this planet.  It's not for everyone, I'll grant that,
<BR>
and it's a type of power-- and as such, it tends to corrupt.  But I'm
<BR>
interested in having power.  In being able to choose my own destiny.  In
<BR>
being empowered to do the sort of work that I love.  In owning an Aston
<BR>
Martin DB7 Vantage Volante.
<BR>
<P>Ah, the Volante...
<BR>
<P>Damn, I am one superficial dude.
<BR>
<P>Okay, okay, but just one more time... Ah... the Volante...
<BR>
<P><P><P>But you know, it doesn't bother me that, for instance, some scientists might
<BR>
be hungry for recognition.  I don't require that people contribute out of
<BR>
the goodness of their hearts.  If a bunch of kids wanna get together and
<BR>
decide that Action Comics #1 is worth thousands and thousands of dollars, I
<BR>
say: cool!  You can't just say to me: &quot;But Jason, wouldn't it be a nicer
<BR>
world if every little boy and girl out there could have an Action Comics #1
<BR>
of their own?&quot;  Come on!  I don't want to live in even-world!
<BR>
<P>In fact, I *hate* even-world!  Damn you even-world!  I curse even-world and
<BR>
all the evil even-worldlians!
<BR>
<P>Oo... that's kinda fun to say: &quot;evil even-worldlians.&quot;
<BR>
