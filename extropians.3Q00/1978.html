Well, I'm certain to get tag teamed again on this one, but its far too juicy
<BR>
to resist.

<EM>&gt; try to understand what their audience wants and provide that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than for those who think that art has some nebulous &quot;higher&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose beyond simple entertainment.  Shakespeare's greatest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strength was that he wrote simple entertainment for simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks; he wasn't afraid to go for the cheap laugh of a dirty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joke or a pun where needed, and his brilliant use of language
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and poetic form wasn't to challenge his audience's mind, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply to entertain them.  He juggled the language like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; street performer juggles torches, as deftly and for the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purpose.  /That/ is the highest form of art.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately art truly -is- nebulous... not because of some sort of hocus
<BR>
pocus, but due to the simple fact that it is necessarily subjective.  The
<BR>
term 'art' is often and variously described as an appeal to aesthetics, a
<BR>
reflection or mutation of nature, or a work of the imagination designed to
<BR>
affect the sense of beauty.
<BR>
<P>Challenging or appealing to one's sense of aesthetics is a far cry from
<BR>
simple entertainment.  The two needn't be mutally exclusive, but it's a very
<BR>
simplistic viewpoint to be unable to see the distinction.
<BR>
<P>'Good' art rarely has mass appeal and the vast majority of what we would
<BR>
consider to be the great artists of this planet did not achieve critical
<BR>
recognition in their lifetimes.
<BR>
<P>In fact, it is in the very nature of innovative thought that it typically
<BR>
does not receive mass public acclaim.  It is fortunate that artists and
<BR>
innovators do not pursue their work on the basis of your criteria above,
<BR>
Lee, for surely some of the greatest innovations of all time would never
<BR>
have taken place.  It's nice to have inventors and entertainers making
<BR>
product that everybody's going to want, but I'd also like to encourage those
<BR>
people who just say, 'screw what everyone else thinks, I'm going to do 'B,'
<BR>
who cares if it seems outrageous.'
<BR>
<P>Understanding what your audience wants makes one a great entertainer, but
<BR>
daring to produce that which they have never seen is the seed of progress.
<BR>
<P>What you deride as a 'nebulous &quot;higher&quot; purpose' represents something
<BR>
fundamental about the human quest-- our thirst for creation, for invention,
<BR>
for &quot;newness.&quot;  Suggesting that we should use as a criterion for success
<BR>
ones ability to cater to the masses is a sure-fire guarantee to select for
<BR>
material that is good at catering to the masses.  But do -you- really care
<BR>
about that?
<BR>
<P>I may be a solipsist, but frankly I am not overly concerned over the success
<BR>
of 'Who Want to Be a Millionaire,' amongst the common person of planet
<BR>
earth, and the mere fact that lots of people want something doesn't make me
<BR>
believe that we should have more of it.  I'm not suggesting that people
<BR>
should or should not pursue certain forms of entertainment, on the contrary
<BR>
I think its very nice that lots of people are pleased by their televisions.
<BR>
<P>But here's a thought, in art, as in everything, don't we want to also induce
<BR>
a selection pressure -against- what everyone wants?  In this context, you
<BR>
might think of art as complex noise in a model of increasing fitness.  From
<BR>
a strictly utilitarian standpoint, you might look at it as a good way to
<BR>
kick oneself out of a negative attractor state.
<BR>
<P>There will always be lots of people around appealing to the lowest common
<BR>
denominator-- hey, there's lots of cash in it.  Even -they- don't pretend
<BR>
that that's the highest form of art.
