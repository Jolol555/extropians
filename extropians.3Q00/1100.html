<HR NOSHADE><P>

<P>
Ah, the game is afoot!
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; No, we don't agree here at all.  Information has no inherent value at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all.  Bits are just bits.  Value is created by the act of people /wanting/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the information, in a certain form at a certain time for their specific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not a distinguishing characteristic of information.  -Nothing- has
<BR>
inherent value independent of our want of it.  Value for cars and
<BR>
electricity and medicine and drooling pets and angora sweaters is created
<BR>
because we want those things.  They don't have 'inherent' value-- we pay
<BR>
because we want, just like everything else.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, that's not the difference at all.  The essential difference is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that freely-copied instances of the same piece of information can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be used to serve two people's goals simulatanously.
</EM><BR>
<P>And why is this an argument in favor of freely copying them?  If it were
<BR>
possible to freely copy computer chips, would it then follow that we should
<BR>
do so because they could be used to serve two people's goals simultaneously?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But information is fundamentally different: it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just that copying is cheap, it's that copying actually does double
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the utility (not value--utility, though utility may lead to value)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because my use of the information does not in any way interfere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with your use of the information
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, receipt of information can have lot's of auxiliary impact and my
<BR>
use of information -can- interfere with your use of information.
<BR>
<P>Information is a &quot;real&quot; thing.  Information directly influences behavior.
<BR>
Copying information doesn't always double it's value-- sometimes weird
<BR>
things happen: if everybody knows the ending to 'The Sixth Sense,' the movie
<BR>
is going to lose a lot of its impact.  You see, there's value in secrets,
<BR>
and there's value in you and I knowing something that Jack doesn't know and
<BR>
there's value in you and I -and- Jack knowing something, and all sorts of
<BR>
permutations.  It's not just a frictionless ghostly vapor that passes freely
<BR>
through society without real consequences.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The rest of this argument proceeds from your flawed assumption, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I won't address it more specifically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I think your assumptions are flawed too, but I'll continue to address
<BR>
them.  On:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; (1) No, a performance is not &quot;information&quot;, it's a unique event
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in time, and as such, cannot be duplicated.  It's value (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember, value is created by comsumers, not producers) might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in some small way the information presented, but it is also in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sensual experience, the gathering of friends, the building
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of memories, &quot;hipness&quot;, and many other things.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, we're getting into tricky territory here and I don't want to spin this
<BR>
off into an experientialist debate, but I would argue that the sensual
<BR>
experience is *only* information and will eventually be able to be
<BR>
replicated freely.  Clearly good VR will enable me to capture the
<BR>
particulars you describe above.  I'll grant that we currently aren't capable
<BR>
of doing so, but this only makes it clear that the scope of information is
<BR>
only going to grow larger and larger in the future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (2) CDs most definitely should /not/ be free and I never said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything of the kind.  What I'm saying is that Metallica should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be able to sell CDs of their music, and I should be able to buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one, press my own CDs of their music, and sell them too.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the music itself that shouldn't be ownable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, this is an example of indirect rewards.  I shouldn't have to rely on
<BR>
making profits off of the medium on which I distribute my data.  CDs are
<BR>
going to be irrelevant fairly soon here.  The value is in the music.  That's
<BR>
what people want, and therefore that's what they should pay for.  Why should
<BR>
we give somone for free what they're willing to pay for?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Exactly.  This method works best for the famous--the less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; famous will have to use other methods, or find ways to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves famous enough to fill concert halls (like using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the net to distribute their music).  The not-so-famous may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to use other methods as well, and actors generall use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work-for-hire (but that's off topic here).
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, famous people are a tremendously small sliver of the population at
<BR>
large and are unlikely to appear in significant numbers at all in an
<BR>
environment without monetary reward.  You seem to have little awareness of
<BR>
the thousands and thousands of working artists who make a living producing
<BR>
content.  Of course, they aren't famous after all, so why would you know
<BR>
about them?  :)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; If you can fill stadiums playing someone else's music, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deserve the money.  Somehow, I suspect authenticity will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a selling point.  Otherwise, why did Milli Vanilli drop out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of existence when it was revealed they weren't singing?  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; music didn't change any.  Well, their value wasn't just in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the music, was it?
</EM><BR>
<P>You got me here.  Authenticity -is- important to us.  We want to know that
<BR>
the people singing the music actually are the ones who made it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Popular movies make millions of dollars on ticket sales in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theaters, which are basically live performances (copying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; among the theaters themselves can be managed by contract).
</EM><BR>
<P>We'll call this market 'spectacle distribution.'  We're paying for the
<BR>
spectacle of sitting in a theatre with stadium seating and surround sound
<BR>
and smelly popcorn.
<BR>
<P>Theatre's &quot;buy&quot; movies in order to make a profit, but why would they bother
<BR>
buying them if they could download them from the Internet for free?  If I
<BR>
can't sell my movies to theatres, I'm not going to spend millions making
<BR>
them anymore.
<BR>
<P>Ah, so maybe you think the filmmakers should get into the 'spectacle
<BR>
distribution' business.  Again, this is an example of indirect rewards.  If
<BR>
it is necessary to own a theatre to make money off of a movie, the business
<BR>
is going to collapse.  You simply can't remove value from a link in the
<BR>
chain here.
<BR>
<P>A simple example:
<BR>
<P>You and I are filmmakers.  We can't sell our films, so we decide to buy
<BR>
movie theatres and sell the 'movie spectacle' instead.  Now, we've got a
<BR>
major problem with distribution right off the bat, 'cause I'm not going to
<BR>
be able to spend a lot of money on my movies with only one theatre to show
<BR>
from.  (My budget will have to go down to the level of live theatre events,
<BR>
and speaking from direct experience, that really sucks.)  But let's pretend
<BR>
I don't care-- I'm happy making just a little bit of money off of the cheap
<BR>
films I shoot and show in my one theatre.
<BR>
<P>You, however, decide to save all that money of actually making the film
<BR>
yourself so you send a guy over to my theatre with a really good copying
<BR>
device and you bring a copy back to your theatre and start showing 'my'
<BR>
movie without having to pay for it.  Remember, I don't have any ownership
<BR>
over that film so it's totally legal for you to do this.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Then, they make millions more with merchandising.  Finally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they make more millions with copyright--by licensing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; TV and video rentals.  This last revenue stream will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bitten into without copyright, but the first two won't.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't be weeping for Paramount if Star Trek XXI makes only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $100 million instead of $200 million.  Jon Williams will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still have been paid up front.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, you're fixating on a tiny sliver of the actual business.  An
<BR>
infintesmal fraction of films make any significant revenue on merchandising.
<BR>
<P>However, it doesn't matter:  you won't have any exclusive rights to your
<BR>
merchandising, so I'll just start making 'better' Star Trek t-shirts than
<BR>
you and I'll make all the money.  The rewards are going to the best
<BR>
merchandiser, not the best filmmaker.
<BR>
<P>To be clear:  There is -no- good reason for the merchandiser to be the same
<BR>
entity as the filmmaker!  Any Joe off the street (or multinational
<BR>
corporation) can start creating product for your film, so this whole concept
<BR>
of exclusive merchandising is going to evaporate.
<BR>
<P>There's not even a good reason to make a Jurassic Park movie for
<BR>
merchandising reasons because if it is a genuinely profitable plastic
<BR>
dinosaur market, everybody's going to get into it.  My best strategy would
<BR>
be to just sit back and wait for a property to come along and make toys to
<BR>
go along with it.  The reward is going to the merchandiser and not the
<BR>
filmmaker.  Now, if I had to -pay- the filmmaker for the right to
<BR>
merchandise off of their product...
<BR>
<P>Sigh.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; You don't have to be very famous at all to make a living.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even a fan base as small as 50-100,000 (small potatoes for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any group with an Internet presence) should be able to earn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a decent living on merchandise if it's sufficiently &quot;hip&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to generate demand, and if the music is good enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintain the fan base.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you vastly underestimate the incredible difficulty musicians face in
<BR>
making a living.
<BR>
<P>And, once again, if there's money in your merchandise market, I'll just come
<BR>
along and snap it up.
<BR>
<P>I'm starting to repeat myself here, so I'll skip ahead a little:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  Neither
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of those things is true: there are lots of other ways to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money, and you can still sell books and records without copyright
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (which is manifestly true from the simple observation that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people still make money selling Shakespeare and Mozart).  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is an entirely consistent point of view.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it's not.  Shakespeare and Mozart are existing properties-- will
<BR>
the market support the creation of additional properties in the absence of a
<BR>
reward system for the creators?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; That's true, but that's also the way it is now: most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rewards of copyright, /by far/, go not to the artist, but to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company that makes the artist popular by controlling marketing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and distribution.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a problem with the system and not the concept of copyright.  In
<BR>
fact, this is the primary reason that I am optimistic about the digital age
<BR>
insofar as it is empowering artists to reach their audiences directly.
<BR>
<P>I'm snipping the rest of this section in the interest of brevity which this
<BR>
post is already sadly lacking.  You talk a bit about how publishers give
<BR>
audiences a good place to go for reliable material and I agree that this is
<BR>
a promising future market.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Those who absolutely cannot make a living by /any/ of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; methods here or others I haven't thought of would really be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing better for themselves and us by earning a living in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some other way.  Doing what you want is a luxury--just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because someone wants to be a musician doesn't mean I should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pass laws to help him.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ugh.
<BR>
<P>I'm not suggestion that people should simply do what they want and get
<BR>
magically rewarded for it.  I'm suggesting that we maintain the free
<BR>
market-- I create something you want, you trade me equivalent goods for it.
<BR>
Plain and simple.  You want music, I spend effort making music, you spend
<BR>
money for my music.
<BR>
<P>Do you believe that passing laws making the theft of automobiles illegal is
<BR>
an example of passing laws to help the automobile industry?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I don't want to destroy the market--I want to fundamentally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change it in a way that will probably put some of them out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of work, and employ 10 times as many in the new economy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unrestricted information.  Demand is there, and will always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be met, so there will always be people making music and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people willing to pay for getting music they like.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry will never go away.  It will just change the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it does business, and eliminating the last shackle on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free exchange and use of information will unleash a flood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of new industries and opportunities that have never existed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow.  Where's all this extra money going to come from?
<BR>
<P>Okay, that was flip, but you sound like you've been swept up into the dot
<BR>
com bubble or something.
<BR>
<P>There's another big post below that I've snipped that sounds like the
<BR>
beginning of a manifesto, and it seems really positive and momentuous like
<BR>
we're just going to be so powerful if we could only cast off the bonds of
<BR>
ownership and I can't help but wonder if you are also in favor of communal
<BR>
ownership of property, commodities, energy and goods, etc?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Neither do I; see my other message on this thread about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confusion among copyright, trademarks, and fraud.  I totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support both trademarks and criminalization of fraud.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?  And what value do you envision a trademark having?
