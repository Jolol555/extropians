<EM>&gt; &gt; So frustrating to find that the names Drexler, Merkle and Freitas are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nowhere to be found in this 144 page document.

<EM>&gt; Guess the whole theory of &quot;Be public and open, so that you have some

</EM><BR>
<P>Folks, I've been as frustrated by certain of the science media's
<BR>
pseudoanalysis of nanotech theory as anyone. At the same time however,
<BR>
without sugar-coating any erroneous anti-nanotech arguments, it's worth
<BR>
noting that some of the opposition to Drexler was probably pretty honest
<BR>
in intent originally, even when mistaken. For instance, _Nano_, Ed
<BR>
Regis' book on the subject, is seemingly quite accurate in depicting
<BR>
the heady atmosphere generated by Drexler's ideas back in the 1980's.
<BR>
Generally, it would be rare for scientists such as Drexler and company
<BR>
to see themselves as in charge of quite such an  earth-shaking
<BR>
revolution -- and of course this was going to generate some kind of
<BR>
determinedly &quot;rare&quot; sorts of opposing views. Even relatively recently,
<BR>
such a far-out scientific visionary as Freeman Dyson can say that he is
<BR>
in some way &quot;skeptical&quot; of Drexler. So if Mr. &quot;Astro-Chickens will
<BR>
explore the solar system&quot; Dyson can express general skepticism, we can
<BR>
only imagine what what the regular, staid, back-of-the-laboratory
<BR>
science worker must think!
<BR>
<P>Anyway, as far as the United States NNI program outline document is
<BR>
concerned, it is not so surprising that the initiators of the key ideas
<BR>
would not be mentioned in the document. Historical analogy: if extremely
<BR>
high-level government committees had been in charge of checking
<BR>
Einstein's theories, would the directives have even mentioned Einstein,
<BR>
or just some of the people who might be sent on eclipse viewing
<BR>
expeditions? More to the point, if someone started handing out lifetime
<BR>
acheivement awards, and they ostentatiously missed Drexler, that *would*
<BR>
be something remiss -- but beaurocratic program outlines aren't really
<BR>
about that, right?
<BR>
<P>Say, *here* is a nice media report on nanotech, in RealAudio format,
<BR>
from the Dec 11, 1999 edition of the Canadian weekly science show
<BR>
&quot;Quirks and Quarks&quot;. It's at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.radio.cbc.ca/programs/quirks/archives.htm">http://www.radio.cbc.ca/programs/quirks/archives.htm</A>. If I recall right,
<BR>
the report is near the beginning of this 50 minute long science program,
<BR>
so you should be able to click right on it and hear the nanotech
<BR>
comments of Richard Smalley and Nadrian Seeman right away -- though
<BR>
Drexler wasn't in this report, and neither, I think, were Merkle nor
<BR>
Freitas, &quot;sigh&quot; :^) .

<P><P>&quot;Astrochicken will not be built, it will be grown . . . its blueprints
<BR>
will be written in the convenient digital language of DNA . . . to
<BR>
receive instructions from earth and transmit back the results . . .&quot;
<BR>
