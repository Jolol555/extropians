<P>I've gotten interesting results by combining an IR image with a normal
<BR>
light image in a novel way- substituting the IR channel for the
<BR>
luminance in an HSL image instead of one of the RGB channels.  This
<BR>
doesn't introduce huge color shifts, but black (opaque) glass becomes
<BR>
gray, blue skies are dark with vivid blue clouds, and plants are light
<BR>
green.  I'll post a trio of pics on alt.binaries.pictures.misc (I gotta
<BR>
make a webpage one of these days).
<BR>
<P>Similarly, a color image + thermal IR would have normal color balance,
<BR>
but the hot spots would be bright- giving people a raccoonlike effect, I
<BR>
think, since noses are cold and eyeballs hot...
