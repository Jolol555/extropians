<P>&lt;&lt; I presume that one of Zubrins frustrations with the 'nano-santa' premise
<BR>
&nbsp;is that it breeds an atmosphere of complacency, where anything hard to
<BR>
&nbsp;do now in space will be put off until the nanites can do it for us. Such
<BR>
&nbsp;an attitude can derail and end manned exploration once and for all, for
<BR>
&nbsp;starters. What this attitude will lead to in the future as well is for
<BR>
&nbsp;it to devolve from acceptance of using robot probes, to merely
<BR>
&nbsp;acceptance of remote observation by telescope, as people get more fat
<BR>
&nbsp;and happy on their couches. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
I wonder if fat and happy people would like to explore the surface of mars, 
<BR>
and that the disatisfied people never would?
