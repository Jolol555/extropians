<P>
The concept of physical beauty is a weird one. I'd be surprised if it has
<BR>
much to do with our physical bodies in the future.
<BR>
<P>I find myself spending ever more time in the weird disembodiment of online
<BR>
life. I like it, I think, but it does conflict with the physical realm
<BR>
somewhat; each competes for limited attention.
<BR>
<P>I remember reading some predictions by Faith Popcorn (geez, where did she
<BR>
get that name?), that the near future would be marked by people retreating
<BR>
into the home-fortress, venturing out less and less often, having everything
<BR>
delivered to them via the wonderful internet. Although I was dubious at the
<BR>
time, I can see it more now. Recently I've had a few friends raving to me
<BR>
about a new Home Shopping service introduced by one of our biggest
<BR>
supermarket chains; you do your grocery shopping online, and it turns up at
<BR>
the front door. As someone who relies on walks to the local shops for
<BR>
exercise (and generation of vitamin D), it doesn't appeal. But then again, I
<BR>
spend a lot more time at home than most people (teleworking - actually most
<BR>
of my time is on the 'net, of course, which is not much like being home at
<BR>
all).
<BR>
<P>I see two convergent trends. The first is that noted above; the retreat from
<BR>
interaction, into the home. The second is stronger global service markets,
<BR>
implying larger distances between supplier &amp; consumer, and so more reliance
<BR>
on advanced information &amp; communication technology, and less reliance on
<BR>
travel. That's in its early days still, but is increasing rapidly. As
<BR>
bandwidth increases and latency falls, as the tools improve and we become
<BR>
more comfortable with them, how does physical travel (slow, disruptive,
<BR>
expensive) compete with electronic communications (fast, easy, cheap)?
<BR>
<P>Back onto the topic of beauty... Maybe I hang out with too many geeks, but I
<BR>
notice more concern with appearance of people's cars than with their own
<BR>
appearance (my car is a broken down '81 ford laser, and I think it still
<BR>
might have the upper hand). The power of the car in the modern psyche (what
<BR>
does psyche mean again? ergh, well, you know) is immense. I'd imagine that
<BR>
TH types tend to underestimate the strength of the car as a symbol of
<BR>
identity in competition with the body itself. It seems to be about trying to
<BR>
get security &amp; freedom in one package, a little travelling embassy of the
<BR>
home fortress.
<BR>
<P>I'm  convinced that &quot;telepresence robots&quot; will be a future move. One path is
<BR>
as a natural evolution of the car. People love their cars, but they don't
<BR>
necessarily like being in them. Much better if you could stay at home, and
<BR>
drive your car from the safety of your loungeroom over your web tv (maybe
<BR>
the next version of the playstation will support this).
<BR>
<P>Of course, when it arrives, your car would have to be able to do the things
<BR>
that you would do, if you had been in it. Not so hard to make it talk, and
<BR>
listen (speakers and microphones, big deal). It'd have to get a lot smaller,
<BR>
but that's ok, because there's no passengers in it any more. So it would be
<BR>
able to go into buildings, talk to people (probably other &quot;cars&quot;). It'd need
<BR>
to be able to manipulate things, and navigate weird terrain, so it might
<BR>
have robot arms and legs.
<BR>
<P>You can see where I'm heading. I think you might find that there is a
<BR>
significant movement, before body mods are possible, towards external
<BR>
bodies. You stay at home, and send your personal avatar out into the world.
<BR>
It interacts with other avatars and those few souls still out there in
<BR>
person. These things would be quite amazing visually, I think; people would
<BR>
take great pride in them. Although I wonder if they'd all be same-same, much
<BR>
like modern cars.
<BR>
<P>You can see it would meet all kinds of needs; fear of the outside world, a
<BR>
powerful feeling of not being in danger of physical violence, yet an ability
<BR>
to interact with the world using a suped-up body which far excedes the
<BR>
capabilities of the flesh form. Security and freedom, together at last. Or
<BR>
that's how I'd sell it, anyway.
<BR>
<P>It's just an intermediate step, on the road between here and an utterly
<BR>
virtual existence (where b2b means brain 2 brain). But all the steps are
<BR>
intermediary in reality; life is about the journey, given the uninspiring
<BR>
destination.
<BR>
<P>I know it seems like a weird vision of the future. Next time you see a
<BR>
couple of younguns sitting near each other, communicating by sending text
<BR>
messages to each other on their mobiles, think about this again.

another excellent topic, Natasha
<BR>
<P>I love what you say about have a beautiful psychology. As one goes
<BR>
&quot;out-of-body&quot; by going on line, all that is visible (other than a typeface)
<BR>
is one's psyche. Sure we can go to a website, look at a picture, and
<BR>
sometimes the beauty inside is reflected outside. But. Too many times ugly
<BR>
people have beautiful skins, and they show their &quot;true colors&quot; on a list
<BR>
forum or in posts...  or a person who seems frumpish and drab in person may
<BR>
have Beautiful Emotions and lovely thoughts, images...words flowing as an
<BR>
online entity...
<BR>
this &quot;inside out&quot; approach is what first fascinated me about meeting people
<BR>
thru the net.
<BR>
<P>As one who is vividly enthusiastic about beauty, I think one of the things
<BR>
you might explore is pushing the envelope of *what* we accept as beauty. As
<BR>
you know, I believe advertising has much to do with what we commonly eat -
<BR>
visually as well as actual fuel nourishment. With your background and
<BR>
knowledge of aesthetics and ads, and your cool art series about body
<BR>
enhancement, what can you see being needed...
<BR>
<P>... as the new beauty alarms, repels, attracts, ...look, if people start to
<BR>
modify... leopard skins, diamond nails, fish scales, translucent eyeballs,
<BR>
extra long limbs, extreme thickness of muscles, etc. Some people won't know
<BR>
how to react, will they?
<BR>
<P>Things that NOW look freakish, because they'd be impossible naturally.
<BR>
Will there be prejudice against mods? I think so.. unless....
<BR>
People will accept it ... surely they need to be re-educated... will it be
<BR>
cool? Wil it be a trend? um...sure...if it's presented well, and backed by
<BR>
sponsorship and ads?
<BR>
public awareness? endorsments? what....
