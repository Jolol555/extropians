I've got to ask a really naive question.
<BR>
<P>What's the point of a CBD? Why do all these companies that do whitecollar
<BR>
work pay the exorbitant sums to have buildings smack in the center of town,
<BR>
forcing their employees consequently to either pay sky high rents
<BR>
themselves, or to commute long distances? What advantage does this confer on
<BR>
the employer?
<BR>
<P>Similarly, why is silicon valley the place to be? Why would I set up
<BR>
business there, with all the attendant cost, if I was running an essentially
<BR>
whitecollar (knowledge work) business? Is it so important to be
<BR>
geographically close to my complementors, and my competition?
<BR>
<P>I realise there's probably a simple answer to this, but for the life of me,
<BR>
I can't work it out.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt; who are truly bums, unwilling to work because most can scam better

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wage...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The latest societal convulsion in the SF Bay area has created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some oddities.  During the bad old days of the late 80s, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had a great number of signers: these guys holding signs insisting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they would WORK for FOOD, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, unfortunately for them, prosperity intervened (Clintonomics?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and even they must have recognized the absurdity of the notion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; holding such a sign on the street corner, when all the local fast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food places had *permanently mounted* their HELP WANTED
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signs in the window.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last year, the government issued a very large number of visas,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to pretty much anyone who could pay taxes on 60k, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just about the starting wage around here for anyone who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place one line of code in front of another, so as one might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect we had a massive influx, which caused the apartment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vacancy rate to drop to a few parts per million, which caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rent prices to skyrocket to the point that the &quot;homeless-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will-work-for-food&quot;ers were in danger of actually becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; literally without a home.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All the local fast food joints have raised the starting wage to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about $9/hour, still not really competitive with what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; signers can earn, but as high as they can pay selling 3 dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hamburgers, but at $9/hour a person would need to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 60 hours a week to cover the rent alone on a typical studio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apartment in Sunnyvale, consequentemente...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the employees leave.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then, the fast food joints start asking their employees to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work longer hours, forgetting why people take those jobs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the first place: they allow people to work part time.  When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are asked to work full time, they figure they might as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well get a *real* job, which they do, and now the Burger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; King is in even worse straits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The will-work-for-fooders stand out there on the corner,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with all limbs in apparent working condition, while Burger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; King is *crying out* for someone willing to just push a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mop and wipe tables.  And they will hire *anyone* no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions asked, dog kickers, mass murderers, whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They hire the mentally retarded, but oddly enough, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arent enough of them either.  And the fast food gets steadily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slower, because there arent enough people working the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kitchen.  Meanwhile the floors and tables get ever dirtier.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Engineering teams dissolve because the young PhDs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot afford the rent.  Those who argue that National
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Missile Defense is an impossible task never do site the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *real* most difficult hurdle facing it: keeping teams together
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in areas that are too expensive for those working the project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For those who have managed to acquire a home, of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is like winning the lottery in slow motion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So here in Silicon Valley we see a foretaste of a future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in which wealth is distributed ever more based on technical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability and insight, steadily less on the number of hours worked.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can see that what must happen here is that the techno-have-nots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must abandon the valley, being replaced in the short run by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commuters from the outlying areas, these being replaced in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the long run by androids.  All this looks great from the point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of view of a techno-have, but I can scarcely imagine the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anguish of the other half.  My solution is to not be one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.  Other ideas?  spike
</EM><BR>
