<P>Plant Oils Will Replace Petroleum In Coming Years 
<BR>
<P>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – When Bernie Tao talks to farmers, he tells them that 
<BR>
although they may not realize it, they're oil barons. 
<BR>
The oil they control isn't below the ground, however. It's growing on top, 
<BR>
contained in the corn and soybean plants in their fields. 
<BR>
<P>It may be green gold instead of black gold, but Tao predicts that over the 
<BR>
next several decades, plant oil will become just as essential to everyday 
<BR>
life as fossil fuels are today. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the 1970s we got our first taste of what it was like when the fuel begins 
<BR>
to go away,&quot; Tao says. &quot;Three decades later we're beginning to see the start 
<BR>
of another large petroleum crunch. And part of that is consumer demand, which 
<BR>
has greatly increased. Consumers like this stuff!&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Anyone standing at a gasoline pump this summer watching the digits scroll by 
<BR>
may wonder whether prices are going to go down. Over the long-term, Tao 
<BR>
points out, they won't. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;One-time-use resources, which are also known as non-renewable resources, 
<BR>
such as petroleum, are a problem because you eventually run out,&quot; he says. 
<BR>
&quot;Eventually we will have to switch from using non-renewable resources to 
<BR>
using renewable resources.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>But Tao and others say that the potential is already there for common field 
<BR>
crops, such as corn and soybeans, to replace petroleum oil as the driver of 
<BR>
our economy within a few decades. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;With a biobased economy, you can produce new raw materials every year, so 
<BR>
you don't have this type of problem,&quot; he says. 
<BR>
<P>Although most biofuel discussions center on ethanol, that's not the only 
<BR>
option, Tao says. &quot;The obvious substitutes for petroleum are plant oils and 
<BR>
fats because they have the same base chemical structure as petroleum,&quot; he 
<BR>
says. 
<BR>
<P>Ethanol is a type of alcohol made by fermenting plant material. Although it 
<BR>
makes a good fuel, it has drawbacks, Tao says. &quot;The economics of ethanol 
<BR>
production are improving as the technology improves,&quot; he says. &quot;But ethanol 
<BR>
has two problems: It doesn't explode like gasoline, and it can absorb water, 
<BR>
which can cause oxidation, rust and corrosion.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>By manipulating plant oils, Tao says it may be possible to create a petroleum 
<BR>
substitute. 
<BR>
<P>Fossil fuels were plants once, millions of years ago, and so it makes sense 
<BR>
that both the fossil fuels we use today and oils produced by plants are 
<BR>
chemically similar. Both are made up of chains of chemicals known as 
<BR>
hydrocarbons. 
<BR>
<P>A hydrocarbon is a carbon atom surrounded by hydrogen atoms. Methane, the 
<BR>
simplest hydrocarbon, is a single carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen 
<BR>
atoms. Gasoline varies from seven to 10 hydrocarbons long. &quot;In fact, the word 
<BR>
'octane' means eight carbons in a chain,&quot; Tao says. 
<BR>
<P>The shorter the chain of carbons, the more explosive the fuel is, and the 
<BR>
more power it offers an engine. 
<BR>
<P>The problem is that plant oils are 14 to 18 carbons in length. &quot;Diesel fuel 
<BR>
is 15 carbons long, which is close to the same size as plant oils. That is 
<BR>
why the first applications are as biodiesel fuel,&quot; Tao says. &quot;You couldn't 
<BR>
burn vegetable oils in today's gasoline engines because their hydrocarbon 
<BR>
chains are too long.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Tao says the possibility exists to make a type of plant gasoline from plant 
<BR>
oils that have shorter carbon chains. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Not surprisingly, shorter-chain vegetable oils do exist,&quot; he says. &quot;Coconut 
<BR>
oil, tropical oils and similar plant oils might make a reasonable 
<BR>
gasoline-like fuel. It might also be possible to transgenetically modify 
<BR>
crops to produce plants with those lengths of fatty acids.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Tao says future scientists could genetically modify corn and soybeans – which 
<BR>
are already two of the highest oil-yielding plants – to produce plant oils 
<BR>
that could be converted into a type of gasoline. &quot;Could you produce a fuel by 
<BR>
combining vegetable oil and ethanol? Actually, the combination of those would 
<BR>
seem to fit nicely into today's engine structures,&quot; he says. 
<BR>
<P>Fuels aren't the only uses of petroleum, Tao says. &quot;If you look at where 
<BR>
petroleum is used, the largest number of applications is in inks, paints and 
<BR>
coatings.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Chemists have known for decades how to alter the hydrocarbon chains in 
<BR>
petroleum through processes known as cracking and reforming. Shortened 
<BR>
hydrocarbon chains are used as solvent bases for paints and chemicals. Longer 
<BR>
chains – as many as 200 hydrocarbons – are known as plastics. But these 
<BR>
products also can be made from plants. 
<BR>
<P>According to Tao, before World War II, most paints, coatings and adhesives 
<BR>
were made from vegetable oils or other plant products. &quot;In the very near 
<BR>
future, some of these products will go back to using vegetable oils instead 
<BR>
of petroleum,&quot; Tao says. &quot;There are latex paints that will be appearing on 
<BR>
the market very soon.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>This isn't a new idea: Henry Ford famously made everything from clothing to 
<BR>
automobile bumpers from vegetable oils just to show that it could be done. 
<BR>
And this past January, Dow Chemical Co. and Cargill Inc. announced that they 
<BR>
will begin production of new plastics made from corn. 
<BR>
<P>Despite this, most products are still made from petroleum instead of plants. 
<BR>
Tao says a look around will show thousands of products that were once made 
<BR>
from plants that are now made from petroleum products. &quot;Candles, for one,&quot; he 
<BR>
says, holding up a blueberry-scented candle made from soybean oil. &quot;It's only 
<BR>
been in the last 60 to 70 years that paraffin wax candles were common.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>As part of an annual contest sponsored by the Indiana Soybean Board, students 
<BR>
at Purdue have created a variety of products that replace petroleum products 
<BR>
with soybean oil, such as candles, crayons, ski wax and fire starters. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;There isn't a huge demand for scientists to develop soybean oil birthday 
<BR>
candles or crayons,&quot; he admits. &quot;But these products are safe for the students 
<BR>
to work with. And once they know how to work with the plant oils, they'll be 
<BR>
better positioned to help create other new products over the next 40 years. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;As we change from a black gold economy to a green gold economy, we'll need 
<BR>
engineers who know how to make products out of plant materials. That's why we 
<BR>
work with these students to make these types of products now.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The need for petroleum is never going to go away, but the question is, how 
<BR>
are we going to use it, Tao says. &quot;Plastics are made from petroleum chains 
<BR>
200 carbons long,&quot; he says, tapping the case of his computer monitor. &quot;We'll 
<BR>
be saving petroleum to make things that we can't make in any other way.&quot;
