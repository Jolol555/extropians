<P>
I was being 'orrible and flippant. But I had a point...
<BR>
<P>Firstly, all this &quot;mysticism&quot; stuff. Gag me with a spoon! Special spiritual
<BR>
insight, grokking the nature of reality; where does that really get you? You
<BR>
feel like it does something positive, but I think it's really just feelgood
<BR>
crud; I'd say you'd be hard pressed to show any measurable benefit of such
<BR>
epiphany. It sounds suspiciously like the idea of psychedelic drugs
<BR>
&quot;expanding your consciousness&quot;. The idea appeals (at least under the
<BR>
influence of them, as far as I recall), but it's pretty much meaningless in
<BR>
any tangible context. In the end, this stuff is the enemy of rational
<BR>
thought, basically by definition.
<BR>
<P>Secondly, and more importantly; this idea of building God for ourselves is
<BR>
downright dangerous. The god meme has appeal; it's nice to believe that
<BR>
there's a point to the universe, after all (delusional as that may be). By
<BR>
extension, when you decide there isn't a God (or a Sysop), then it can seem
<BR>
like a good idea to make one, or become one.
<BR>
<P>What does that mean, though? If you are going to build a do-it-yourself
<BR>
guardian (in the sense of Plato - it was Plato, wasn't it?) then I think
<BR>
that's bad news; the best outcome we can hope for is failure. It's also
<BR>
bloody arrogant.
<BR>
<P>If you are going to become one, you either envisage being such a guardian,
<BR>
or maybe raising everyone up to equal status. In the guardian case, the same
<BR>
arguments apply as above. In the egalitarian case, where is godhood? It's
<BR>
more powerful beings, sure, but a society of such. So the concept of God is
<BR>
not useful in that context.
<BR>
<P>Basically, the concept of God is all about authority, control, dominance.
<BR>
The ideas of benign rule, divine right, perfection. If you have any kind of
<BR>
individualist streak, these are anathema.
<BR>
<P>Gods will not help us where we are going. But they could seriously stuff
<BR>
things up.

<P><P><EM>&gt; Emlyn,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you missed Mitch's point. He is not praying to God for help to
</EM><BR>
cure
<BR>
<EM>&gt; us; he is asking for help in building God to be us.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not to get holy-roller on anyone here, but I agree with Samatha's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conjecture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that if there is no God, then there is certainly room for one in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Universe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that includes suffering. What Samantha gets when she &quot;recieves a lift&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reading certain religious tracts is one of the religious experiences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; described by 19th century psychologist Willam James.  Having a God
</EM><BR>
module
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; good if it connects one up with a sense of a better ethical system. If
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; leads only to the Inquisition torture chamber, then it's a bad bet.  So
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; talking 'outcomes' here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ultimately, it may turn out that some advanced primate species (humans)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had a God module as part of their brain, and it helped them develop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that colonized the cosmos, which in the end leads to an ultimate Mind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (God)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which fixed things that needed fixing (since it has ultimate computing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and help resurrect people such as Samantha! This is more inspired from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reading of Julian Barbour (The End of Time)  as well as Tipler and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Barrow's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Final Anthropic Principle. Talk amongst yourselves, i'm getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ver-klempt!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (sob!)
