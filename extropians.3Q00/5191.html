Basically, it is a really bad implementation of CYC.  Before the whole
<BR>
MindPixel thing became a media sensation, I tried to see if I could get a
<BR>
good explanation from McKinstry regarding how he was going to solve some
<BR>
of the hard problems that aren't resolved by his design, since he was
<BR>
constantly touting it over email.  I didn't get much more than some vague
<BR>
handwaving, which I assumed meant that some real issues weren't even being
<BR>
addressed and at which point I pretty much dismissed the whole &quot;mindpixel&quot;
<BR>
thing.
<BR>
<P>Of course as chance would have it, he became a momentary media darling
<BR>
many months later, though the hype is lost on me.  The only thing clever
<BR>
about his design is that he got tens (hundreds?) of thousands of people to
<BR>
participate in his silly experiment.
