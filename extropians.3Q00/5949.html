<EM>&gt; &gt; I would also point out that making humans smarter may well be necessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in order for us to be capable of making a fully functioning AI (or seed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of one).

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think you've made an excellent point here. Do you think making humans more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; friendly may also be necessary for us to be capable of making a friendly and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sane AI (or Seed AI)?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes.  Directly and by implication.  If, as we get more intelligent we
<BR>
don't find good reasons to be more &quot;friendly&quot; it is more doubtful that
<BR>
an AI that is more intelligent will come up with such reasons.  It[the
<BR>
AI] also has less species bonding if you will.  Also, if we don't come
<BR>
up with a &quot;friendlier&quot; society then a less friendly society will be the
<BR>
background in which the first AIs develop and find themselves.  It is
<BR>
more likely they will get less &quot;friendly&quot; initial imprints.  If the
<BR>
society for instance is massively competitive over cooperative then the
<BR>
AI will be more likely to be strongly competitive, perhaps to our and
<BR>
its detriment.
