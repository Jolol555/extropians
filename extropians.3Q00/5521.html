Mike Lorrey wrote, quoting me:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And for it to be useful in the examples cited, you have to be ready to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kill in response to an assault of less than lethal magnitude.  You need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be ready to kill in response to robbery, for example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hal, thats clearly false, since she did say one person was beaten to death,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and given the statistics of risk of being killed during a rape, robbery, etc,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is a significant probability of deadly harm in such events, and given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that its been proven that you are at least 30% more likely to survive such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crime if you are armed with a gun, then not carrying one is simply stupid.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think what I said is false.  In most cases a rape, robbery,
<BR>
etc., is &quot;an assault of less than lethal magnitude&quot;, don't you agree?
<BR>
And by being armed in case of such confrontations, &quot;you have to be ready
<BR>
to kill in response&quot;, don't you agree?  This is exactly what I said.
<BR>
<P>Don't you agree that if you are carrying a gun and will use it in
<BR>
case you are robbed, then &quot;you need to be ready to kill in response
<BR>
to robbery&quot;, as I said?  As you and others have stated many times,
<BR>
you should not carry the gun unless you are willing and ready to kill.
<BR>
And if you are going to carry and use it in cases of robbery, then you
<BR>
must be ready to kill in response to robbery.
<BR>
<P>Or have I misinterpreted you?
