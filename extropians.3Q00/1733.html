<P>&quot;Like the open source movement, there should be an open science movement.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Sasha Chislenko, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conversation in restaurant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after Extro 4
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Where I think there is legitimate disagreement with transhumanist ranks is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over what the appropriate and necessary conditions are for the safe use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; new technologies. We are beginning to see that debate in the discussion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over gray goo. I support the necessity of a consumer and environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movement, working to make sure that pressure is kept on to ensure the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safety of new technologies. And I believe we need federal agencies whose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job it is to regulate for safety and efficacy.
</EM><BR>
<P>We have a tricky path to walk, and yet a rewarding one. Tricky because
<BR>
there is a tendency to think in dualistic terms-- big evil corporations 
<BR>
versus courageous ELF terrorists. Rewarding because the average, undecided,
<BR>
moderate person who's following the issue might be facing a lesser of 
<BR>
to evils dilemma. They will therefore welcome a third option, a balanced
<BR>
alternative.
<BR>
<P>I think those interested should get together and write a Transhumanist
<BR>
position paper. Yes, yes, I know that any time you have N
<BR>
Transhumanists together you have two to the power of N opinions. When I
<BR>
say position paper I mean a document summarizing a consensus view of
<BR>
the movement, and if there are several schools of thinking that 'agree
<BR>
to disagree', then representing each school. It is possible to do--
<BR>
after all, not everyone here participated in the writing of the
<BR>
Transhumanist FAQ or the Transhumanist Principles (v 1.0 was that?
<BR>
Hello, who's the lazy bum who started and abandoned THAT project? :-) )
<BR>
and there are probably quite a few people who haven't gotten around to
<BR>
reading them so far. Yet those documents still give a reasonably
<BR>
accurate idea of Transhumanism. What I have in mind is something like
<BR>
that but specific to genetic engineering.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact Alex Bokov's response shows that he, and perhaps many others in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhuman circles, have many concerns about corporate-directed research:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On many issues, I am opposed to the agenda
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the agricultural industry, including terminator seeds and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patenting of genes. For that matter, I question the continued value of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patents and copyrights in general, but that's a different discussion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; However, when genophobes try to make this into a black and white issue,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it becomes an assault on science and rationality, and I am forced to ally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with whomever else happens to be against them. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And that I think is the key strategic question: what is the best way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defend scientific progress and promote transhumanist ideas?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think we would do well to advance the cause of transhumanism by not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; veering off into a technophilic mirror-parody of the Green's Luddism, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to steer closer to a rationalistic, future-minded, techno-realism. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You know, their stubborn absolutism may be ruining the Greens just like
<BR>
religious fundamentalism threatens to ruin the republican party. That's
<BR>
certainly what made me decide that they aren't the way to go (I care
<BR>
care deeply about preserving the Earth *for* humans, not *from* them).
<BR>
Absolutist memes are simple and addictive, but they tend to isolate
<BR>
their carriers from mainstream public support, at least in democratic
<BR>
cultures.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Bioengineered critters could wreak havoc, and here's how we prevent that...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GM food could be dangerous, but it hasn't been, and here's how we make sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it isn't...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and at least in Alex and my cases apparently) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No genes shouldn't be patentable, but that will actually accelerate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific progress and the development of new  applications, not impede
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them...
</EM><BR>
<P>Intellectual property issues would definitely be a crucial topic a &gt;H
<BR>
position paper. In fact, I think how we resolve the IP debate may be a
<BR>
deciding factor in whether we evolve into a humans-first society or a
<BR>
humans-are-superfluous society. But, that's a topic for a future essay
<BR>
I have simmering on the back burner.
<BR>
<P>So, then, here's what I'm doing. I've written a seed document which over
<BR>
time we can develop into a transhumanist position paper using the Crit 
<BR>
mediator. Here is the URL (no it's not a typo; paste it in as shown)--

<BR>
<P>I invite everyone, including Alias. Especially Alias, if he is willing to
<BR>
engage in good faith debate aimed at actually uncovering answers.
