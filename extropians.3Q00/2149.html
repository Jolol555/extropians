<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please, napster fans, how do we motivate people to do things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; like writing The Spike if their blood, sweat and tears can so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; easily be copied free?  ...

<EM>&gt; In addition to the evidence adduced by Eliezer, I would like to add
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the complete works of Shakespeare.  Under your hypothesis he could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never have written his works or they couldn't be very good...
</EM><BR>
<P>James I do hope you are right, for I am not arguing that the tide
<BR>
of &quot;information-freedom&quot; can be held back. Of course, every
<BR>
generation will produce a few Eliezers, a few Shakespeares,
<BR>
A few Linux developers, many other notables who will post good
<BR>
stuff for free.  But what if guys like Damien had to get a day
<BR>
job flipping burgers to pay the rent?  The Spike could not have
<BR>
been produced in his spare time after a 9 to 5.
<BR>
<P>I am uncharacteristically pessimistic perhaps because I see
<BR>
what kinds of information are free now.  You sited BSD, GNU
<BR>
and Linux, but most of the free info out there is advertisement,
<BR>
lame sit-coms and religious propaganda.  The problem will be
<BR>
not just figuring out how to reward the good information providers,
<BR>
it will be in finding the good information under mountains of
<BR>
jesus-is-coming-soon memes.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, I may sound more like my Tiggeresque self when
<BR>
I say such a thing is conceivable: there have been systems
<BR>
before in which good content providers were rewarded.  The
<BR>
commies underwrote composers for instance.  Russia
<BR>
in the 19th and 20th centuries produced some truly great
<BR>
classical compositions.  The US during the same period
<BR>
eventually developed rock and roll, so that shows to go ya,
<BR>
art for the proletariat masses isnt all bad.  {8-]
<BR>
<P>This crit tool which I am just now coming to appreciate might
<BR>
be a means to help identify good content by allowing users
<BR>
to identify who has written commentaries on any given piece
<BR>
of content for instance.  Pay Pal might be used as Eliezer has
<BR>
suggested to send someone a buck if you like their site.  I
<BR>
mentioned some months ago a guy who was an expert in
<BR>
transmissions, who wrote and posted articles thereon, and
<BR>
said he would continue to do so as long as he got enough
<BR>
donations in the mail to make it worth his time.  I havent
<BR>
checked to see if he is still there.  spike
