<EM> &gt;Do you think that these several devout catholics are typical?
</EM><BR>
<P>St. Anslem's College (near me in Southern New Hampshire) has just
<BR>
done one of those wonderfully weird things that the Catholic church
<BR>
does sometimes through having the goal of being catholic.  In full
<BR>
understanding, they hired an atheist friend of mine who just got her
<BR>
theology Phd, to teach theology.   Theology with an outside
<BR>
perspective.   That's the kind of thing you don't see &quot;insecure&quot;
<BR>
faiths doing. 
<BR>
<P>I agree about education making a difference.  Catholicism has a much
<BR>
stronger intellectual bent than most religions, though you don't tend
<BR>
to run into it in the average adherent, who is, in fact, allowed
<BR>
to be quite ignorant even of the faith itself, which I find
<BR>
completely amazing.
<BR>
<P>It's interesting, by becoming focused on itself rather than
<BR>
scripture, Catholicism has become one of the most versatile of the
<BR>
major religions, but that self-focus is also really vulnerable to
<BR>
horrifying abuses like the Inquisition, since it weakens the original
<BR>
meme-set.
