<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Tipler et al. actually once proved some powerful theorems about open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  universes, showing that it was not possible to close them by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rearranging the matter inside. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In his Theory of Immortality, though, he does give an example of how very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tiny amounts of energy, over a very long time can rearrange matter in order 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to close the universe in  two directions. That example was using a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; butterfly's energy to move the earth from one side of it's orbit around the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sun to the other side-in about 500 million years!
</EM><BR>
<P>That is not the same thing. Yes, you can move around the matter in the
<BR>
universe quite a bit using small impulses and a lot of time and
<BR>
cleverness. But the theorem actually says you cannot close an open
<BR>
universe no matter what, it has to do with the spacetime topology and
<BR>
cannot be changed by merely (say) piling all the matter into a big
<BR>
ball or something similar. To make matters worse, we have a
<BR>
cosmological constant to deal with too. Of course, quantum gravity and
<BR>
such things may complicate things enough to enable closure, but that
<BR>
remains in the realm of wishing for the moment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;Sure, but that is not good evidence for Tiplers position. If he had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made a plausible sketch of such a system or showed some theorem that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implied the existence of high-energy complex systems he would be on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much steadier ground. Now he is just assuming that it must be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible, a bit like a space program assuming that before landing we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will have come up with a way of landing softly...&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, what Tipler left out, Hans Moravec put in, with his Neutron Star 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computers-or neutronium computations-however one wants to state this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, a neuron star is a nice thing when you want to resurrect your
<BR>
relatives all the way back to pre-dynastic Egypt and other small
<BR>
projects :-) But it doesn't give you the real, infinite
<BR>
calculations/memory storage, Omega Point. Accept no substitutes :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One of the great failures over the last 55 years has been the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failure to produce a successful, commercial, fusion power plant. My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point is that at least with tokamaks and stellerators, the greatest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical problem is plasma &quot;turbulence&quot; or variation of the plasma
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stream; which tends to quench the super-hot reactions needed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce workable reactors. Call this a serendipity of scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discovery; but such turbulence or variations, can be considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;primordially&quot; to be usable as a kind of super-hot computer--in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great, great, distant future. Its utility today might be analogous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to an antimatter-powered pacemaker; doable, but why-ever-fore?
</EM><BR>
<P>That plasma can be chaotic does not prove that it can be used to
<BR>
perform useful calculations. I'm not aware of any proofs that plasma
<BR>
chaos is of the right kind to be Turing-complete, but I can imagine it
<BR>
is. However, a real physical (nuclear) plasma is a different thing,
<BR>
and may very well have diffusion or randomness effects that disrupts
<BR>
the computations.
