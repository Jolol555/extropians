[Non-member submission]
<BR>
<P>I'm participating in another BBC TV documentary; this time it's on the
<BR>
future of work. The programme is about know how technology will change
<BR>
the way people work and how they relate to work. They seem to have in
<BR>
mind a timeframe of 10-15 years, but I don't think I'm strictly bound to
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P>Are there any points that anybody here thinks that I should make? (You
<BR>
can either email me privately or dicsuss it here on the list.)
<BR>
<P>I'm planning to talk about virtual reality: how teleworking may become
<BR>
popular when VR gets good enough that you can get those social
<BR>
interactions with office mates that seem to be so essential. When that
<BR>
stage is reached (I'm reckon this could implemented on a large scale in
<BR>
about fifteen years) then there seems to be no reason why anybody who
<BR>
works only with information would need to be physically present in the
<BR>
office. Life guards on beaches etc. are a different matter, since it is
<BR>
doubtful that robots will be good enough and cheap enough to replace
<BR>
manual labour within that time scale.
<BR>
<P>AI (and uploading) is a big and important topic, which I might or might
<BR>
not go into - I tend to doubt that it will have a huge effect until it
<BR>
gets smarter than humans, and when it does that it may quickly change
<BR>
almost everything. Performance-enhancing drugs, or drugs which could
<BR>
make us enjoy work more, is another interesting topic. Other ideas?
