<P>&lt;&lt; In that way, and in that way only, god does exist. Not because there 
<BR>
really 
<BR>
&nbsp;is anything out there &quot;shaping&quot; things, but because for so damn long, our 
<BR>
&nbsp;existance has been infinitely shaped by the thought(s) that he/it does. And 
<BR>
&nbsp;the following mayhem or order depending on your world view. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Things would be very very different if the &quot;god modules&quot; weren't installed 
<BR>
in 
<BR>
&nbsp;us. Unimagineable to say how.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;No one can say that a thought is reality,  yet to deny it's existance is 
<BR>
&nbsp;lunacy. There lies the conundrum.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Jeepers, like ya never heard of platonism? Lots of scientists like this 
<BR>
concept and so do mathematicians and they wonder where the numbers come from 
<BR>
and how they relate. Having said that, remember we are not just working in 
<BR>
the happy realm of logical positivism, my friends, but that funny subset of 
<BR>
the universe that appears when our instruments to measure reality improve. 
<BR>
Many hard-assed astronomers back in the 1950's for example, did not even 
<BR>
consider the existence of planetary bodies circling other stars, because they 
<BR>
(except for a fringe), didn't consider it worthty of study. The same occured 
<BR>
with the notion of blackhole physics and neutron stars. Logical positivists 
<BR>
state that all we can meaure is what actually exists.
