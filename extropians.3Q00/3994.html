<EM>&gt; Excuse me, I misunderstood, given that the fictional argument  he used was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political/socio economic, I assumed he was assigning mathematical values to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real social problems.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't think it is necessarily appropriate to assign mathematical values
<BR>
to real social problems, rather it is a matter of selecting a
<BR>
mathematical model based upon personal values.  Which mathematical model
<BR>
is &quot;optimal&quot; is predicated on whether one decides that the future of any
<BR>
given individual is more important than the future of the entire
<BR>
population of individuals.  Once such a distinction has been made, the
<BR>
choice is relatively obvious, though still complex.
<BR>
<P>The biggest problem I think many people on this list have with controlled
<BR>
markets in solving socio-economic problems is that where there are floors,
<BR>
there are also ceilings.  Suggesting that such a solution is optimal will
<BR>
obviously grate against people who don't believe in arbitrarily imposed
<BR>
limits on their own personal expansion.  In other words, a lot of people
<BR>
here are the people who would suffer most in a more controlled economy.  A
<BR>
real socio-economic floor and virtually infinite opportunity are mutually
<BR>
exclusive concepts, unless the floor is so low that there is essentially no
<BR>
floor either.
<BR>
<P>I imagine that switching from a free market to a totally
<BR>
centralized planning would generate no net decrease in suffering. 
<BR>
Instead, one would merely be shifting the suffering from one set of
<BR>
individuals to another, though perhaps in a different form.
