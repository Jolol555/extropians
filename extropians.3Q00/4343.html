<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That said, I find your reaction, Paul, to be out of proportion. Clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something else is going on here, and Mike's comment just triggered it. As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hal noted, several people had engaged you on this issue in a perfectly calm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and reasonable manner.
</EM><BR>
<P>For starters everyone, and I mean everyone I tell about Extropy, and who then seek
<BR>
it out on this list and elsewhere has almost always come back to me and said and I
<BR>
quote, &quot;These people are a bunch of fascists!&quot; or words to that effect.  I'm not
<BR>
kidding when I say this is by far the most common reaction.  And I always get very
<BR>
defensive at this response, and usually reply by saying, &quot;how can you have a
<BR>
problem with people trying to better themselves, to extend their lives, to reach
<BR>
for the stars?!&quot;.  And their response, &quot;Paul, it has nothing to do with these
<BR>
things, it has to do with their strong stance on free-markets and an almost
<BR>
religious reverence for all things Randian&quot;.  Since I am not a Randian scholar all
<BR>
I can do is ask them to be more specific from which they sigh and say, &quot;I have yet
<BR>
to hear a clear and concise way how free-markets beyond any economic prosperity
<BR>
they are likely to bring can rigorously be applied to the political and legal
<BR>
arena such that basic civil rights protections and liberties can be guaranteed for
<BR>
everyone rather than those with the most money to afford it&quot;.  Or arguments to
<BR>
that effect.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Paul, your comments here puzzle me. You yourself have just stated that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strongly favor free markets. So do most of us here.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll will be more clear.  I would like to see a liberalization and privatization
<BR>
of everything if possible including civil protections.  For example, I've
<BR>
personally been convinced of the efficacy of decentralizing the creation of new
<BR>
competing currencies.  I have also been convinced that free-markets if left to
<BR>
their own guises will likely increase overall economic prosperity for everyone.
<BR>
Issues which I, and apparently everyone else have failed to demonstrate, is how
<BR>
such free-market principles can be applied to solve such cases such as the DeCSS,
<BR>
and basic civil rights protections for the poor.  That is the crux of my issue
<BR>
here - I do not hate the poor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your rhetorical question &quot; Ever wonder why the majority of people who come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; across so called Extropian(TM) thinking run away?&quot; seems to express your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; personal frustration.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is not an accurate assessment - it more accurately expresses my frustration
<BR>
at having supported this movement both publicly and privately despite tremendous
<BR>
opposition (described above) only to stubbornly realize after all these years that
<BR>
what they were saying all along was right .
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Of course extropian thinking is not for everyone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That hardly makes it dogmatic. Yes, there have been some unpleasant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exchanges on this list, but they are generally milder and less frequent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that on many email lists. The recently reissued List Rules are designed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; further enforce civility.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is *not* about civility.  Sure, it gets very tiresome.  No, what it's really
<BR>
about *is* the calm and rational posts advocating a system where only the wealthy
<BR>
can afford basic civil protections.  As several have repeatedly said - &quot;The poor
<BR>
by definition do not deserve anything&quot;.  I find such a position entirely
<BR>
despicable and I  no longer want any part of it!   Such a position is so revolting
<BR>
and disgusting that I can no longer be associated with anyone advocating it,
<BR>
regardless of how calm or they might present it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Paul, you go on to mention some unspecified &quot;intelligentsia&quot; who have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; written off Extropy Institute as a joke. I must say that, coming out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blue, this seems like a mean-spirited comment.
</EM><BR>
<P>No it is not a mean spirited comment since I wasn't the one who said Extropy
<BR>
Institute was a joke.  That would be like shooting myself in the foot.  I'm simply
<BR>
echoing the sentiments others have made.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would like to know who are these people who regard ExI (or just the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; List?) as a joke and why.
</EM><BR>
<P>Naming people in a public forum like this without their permission would be a
<BR>
gross violation of their trust.  The list of people I know for sure hold this
<BR>
opinion would include at least two people from the original counter-culture
<BR>
movement, a founder of a now defunct cyber-cultural magazine (any guesses?), 2
<BR>
with Ph.d's in computer science of which one is a researcher in Artificial
<BR>
Intelligence, and several others who I have forgotten by name over the last
<BR>
several years.  Believe it or not there are a lot of other people out there
<BR>
working on extropian ideas and technology who you probably do not know simply
<BR>
because they are too busy or unsatisfied with the Extropy(tm) in particular.  The
<BR>
Ph.D working in Artificial Intelligence has been a close and personal friend for
<BR>
over 10 years and mentioning his name here would be a violation of his trust.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I'm sorry to hear that and hope you will reconsider. I find your response
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be disproportionate. If you find the List discussions to be excessively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pro-free market, why reject everything else about the Institute--the Extro
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conferences, the local lists and meetings, the website, extrodot.org, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropian Principles (which nowhere demand acceptance of specific economic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or political systems), and our forthcoming knowledge management tool?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't reject those things Max.  And I do believe that my initial call to boycott
<BR>
Extropy(tm) might be an overreaction.  However what I am trying to do (admittedly
<BR>
on the fly) is show my public disgust at what I see as the dominating disdain so
<BR>
many people have in this community for the poor and less fortunate.  Call it my
<BR>
moral duty to cry &quot;Foul!&quot; when I can no longer remain silent.
