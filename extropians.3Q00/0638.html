<EM>&gt;Subject: human/world interfaces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Date: Thu, 6 Jul 2000 13:10:24 -0500
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In going through the list archives I came upon a thread which began as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion of &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; and evolved through mathematical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability and on to the ability to form visual images from memory.  Later,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after I'd subscribed to the list, I rambled on about my weird way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interfacing with the world and some people commented on my apparent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;synethesia (eg. I see leaves swirling from a tree in the fall, and the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the leaves falling is translated in my mind into music and often touch 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well, as though I'm feeling the swirl of the leaves against my skin).  At
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the time, I hadn't read the earlier thread, so I didn't know if other 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be interested in this sort of stuff; so I didn't say anything more at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the time.  Now that I know there's an interest, I'd like to open the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion up again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My original reason for being interested in the human/world interface is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self-curiosity.  I realized from an early age that my mind didn't work like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other people's, and that as a result it was hard for me to communicate with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them, and I've often felt lonely. When I was a kid I thought I'd been put 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the wrong planet by mistake, and when I heard stories of UFO's, I hoped one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would come and get me and take me to my proper home.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a science fiction novel whose title I've forgotten - Something like 
<BR>
&quot;.... (maybe Saving) Saint Germ&quot; which deals with precisely what you're 
<BR>
saying.  Female author, recent...... Rather nice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Later, I expanded my selfish motivations to include the possibility of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improving my communications skills.  If I could figure out how most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interfaced with the world, I'd be able to imagine how it felt to be them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and then I'd stand a better chance of saying the right things to them.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't mean right as in politically correct but rather, right as in &quot;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crazy.&quot;  (people used to say of me that I was off in my own little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;god-knows-where world)(my brother once suggested that I might be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic, but I don't think I quite fit that category
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[the following from message sent to extropian list by altamira 6/17/00]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for example, looking at clouds and seeing hundreds of different shades of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;white and at the same time hearing (in one's mind) all these shades of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;white
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;translated into corresponding frequencies of sound; or listening to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rumbling of a machine and suddenly hearing intensely beautiful music in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;combination of sounds and seeing (in the mind) the sounds translated into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something like graphs of mathematical functions, weaving in and out of each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I think that some of this is simply the willingness to allow ones mind to 
<BR>
produce those permutations.  It takes an act of will - for me, at least.  
<BR>
However, my recollection is that mariuana vastly enhanced the ease of doing 
<BR>
that sort of thing - both for me and for the people with whom I otherwise 
<BR>
might have found rather dull.
