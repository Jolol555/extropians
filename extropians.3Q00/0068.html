</EM><BR>
<P>A technique that falls under the category of &quot;how to defeat
<BR>
penetration aids.&quot;  Please allow me to punt that one for now
<BR>
and share what looks to me like a much more forbidding problem.
<BR>
<P>The skills required to build the NMD are the same skills required
<BR>
to design commercial systems which are worth more.  In Sunnyvale
<BR>
the local companies can offer young engineers a lot more money to
<BR>
start, higher raises, plus stock options and a BMW, things that
<BR>
defense companies cannot do and will not be able to do any time
<BR>
in the foreseeable.
<BR>
<P>Defense systems evolve.  If a system is put in place and does not
<BR>
constantly change and improve, it will eventually be defeated, as
<BR>
ignominiously as was the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line.
<BR>
In order for a national missile defense system not follow the same
<BR>
fate, it must continue to evolve, even after it is deployed.
<BR>
<P>We dont have enough people.  That situation is getting worse as
<BR>
time goes on, for several reasons, such as:
<BR>
<P>1)  We are imagining more and more applications for advanced
<BR>
control systems.  For instance, we want robots that can  go out
<BR>
and wash our cars, mow the yard, change the baby's diapers, etc.
<BR>
In those examples, the actuation systems are easy, the control
<BR>
systems are difficult.  But possible.
<BR>
<P>2)  The payoff for advanced control systems is getting ever greater.
<BR>
We sited earlier the difficult situation of janitors in the Silicon Valley,
<BR>
as rents go up 20% a year while their salary goes up 5%.  They
<BR>
already cram 8 to 10 of them in a 2 bedroom apartment.  What to
<BR>
do?  Some lefty politicians have suggested rent controls for those
<BR>
in the service professions, but that will be only a temporary band-aid.
<BR>
What we really need to do is invent robots that clean offices at night.
<BR>
Again actuation easy, control difficult.
<BR>
<P>3)  No one has yet figured out what to do with the children while
<BR>
both parents are at their jobs.  We need robo-nannies in the worst
<BR>
way, preferrably ones that can drive.  As soon as such things are
<BR>
available, soccer moms will be instantly replaced by soccer robots.
<BR>
<P>4)  Robots as servants and companions for the elderly, again
<BR>
preferrably with drivers licenses.
<BR>
<P>5)  Robots as sexual companions for nerds and the kinky.
<BR>
<P>6)  Robots to clean and maintain everything, including themselves
<BR>
[especially if they are used as in application 5 above.]
<BR>
<P>If a young PhD has the skills to guide an orbitting robot capable
<BR>
of identifying a threat and focusing a laser on it, then she can
<BR>
also tackle any of the above example problems, and make
<BR>
a lot more money doing it [especially if she can do a convincing
<BR>
job with application 5 above].  This I see as the biggest difficulty
<BR>
in making and keeping a National Missile Defense.  On the
<BR>
other hand, those capable of building threats may also realize
<BR>
they could do muuuuch better building plowshares than swords.
