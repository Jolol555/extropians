<P>
We want to change ourselves, to make ourselves richer, smarter, and more
<BR>
able.
<BR>
And others don't seem terribly excited by this.  Why?  One simple theory is
<BR>
that
<BR>
they are afraid of what we would do with such powers.
<BR>
<P>If you need a vivid demonstration, try the following question on people you
<BR>
know:
<BR>
<P>&quot;A random person in the world will be chosen, and you get this choice:
<BR>
a) Let them have $X more worth of real resources (such as by telling them
<BR>
where
<BR>
to find an oil reserve that would otherwise remain unfound.)
<BR>
b) Nothing happens.
<BR>
Which do you choose?
<BR>
<P>Caveats:  You don't get to learn who it is before you choose.  They never
<BR>
learn
<BR>
that it was you that allowed them this benefit.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If you let X be a million or more dollars worth, most people will choose
<BR>
nothing.
<BR>
They will explain that it could be another Hitler, and they wouldn't want
<BR>
to be
<BR>
responsible for that.  Which I find pretty amazing.
<BR>
<P>Interesting variations:
<BR>
1) How large would X be before you switch to picking nothing?
<BR>
2) Let the choice be about whether to give one &quot;wish&quot; (where the standard
<BR>
restrictions apply, e.g., no wishing for more wishes).
<BR>
3) Instead of choosing to increase their wealth, let the choice be about
<BR>
whether to increase their looks, charisma, intelligence, or lifespan.
