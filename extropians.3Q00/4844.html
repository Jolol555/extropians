<EM>&gt; There is less scope for being &quot;right&quot; in disagreements about values. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once we understand what we want, and opponents decide they don't want 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, there isn't that much more to say to them. 
</EM><BR>
<P>People's values seem to be derived from some set of fundamental values,
<BR>
and the facts that they believe to be true. So we can convince people
<BR>
that we are &quot;right&quot; about values in two ways. The first is to convince
<BR>
them of a new set of facts, and the second is to convince them that their
<BR>
derived values are not consistent with their fundamental values and their
<BR>
beliefs about facts. As an example, if you convince a theist that there
<BR>
are no gods, that would probably change a number of his values.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure if there is a standard theory of how values change, but it
<BR>
isn't hard to construct one that fits in nicely with the standard theory
<BR>
of how beliefs about facts change (i.e. the Bayesian theory of
<BR>
probability). Start with a utility function U that describes the
<BR>
fundamental values. U maps a state of the universe x to a real number
<BR>
U(x) representing how desirable that state is. Define V(U,P,K) to be sum
<BR>
over all x of U(x)*P(x|K). We can now compute someone's value on any
<BR>
statement s (i.e., how much he desires that statement to be true) as
<BR>
V(U,P,K and s) where U is his fundamental values, P is his prior
<BR>
probability distribution, and K is all of his past experiences.
