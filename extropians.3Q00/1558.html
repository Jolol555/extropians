<P><EM>&gt; I'm pretty sure it gets explained by the costs exceeding the benefits.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  You have to sacrifice a huge amount (imagine the rate of change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  post-singularity) to go off and colonize another star system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It probably effectively exiles you from the original stellar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  economy (whatever that looks like).  Sure, you can be a hermit,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  go off and live quietly in the forrest, but you don't run around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  building megacities in the forrest because you know that has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  already been done and the people who have done it are way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ahead of you on the curve.  Robin might disagree with this however. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Robert, this has always been one of the things in your otherwise impressive 
<BR>
&quot;theory of SIs&quot; that I can't buy.  I think you're missing an essential 
<BR>
element of WHO does the colonizing (and also, how much it costs).  
<BR>
<P>Let's say that the solar-system-scale SI you've designed gets built.  Now, 
<BR>
just how much investment DOES it take to colonize another star system?  While 
<BR>
I've become convinced that it's more than a pea-sized probe that has to be 
<BR>
spit out at the next star system, it doesn't take THAT much mass or energy, 
<BR>
compared to what your mega-super-duper SI has at its disposal.  What if it's 
<BR>
something with the mass of an asteroid?  So what?  Big deal, when you've got 
<BR>
everything out to the Oort cloud to play with.
<BR>
<P>But more important, the factor you talk about here doesn't work the way you 
<BR>
seem to assume.  Let's say I'm the mega-super-duper SI.  I build my 
<BR>
comparatively cheapo colony-seed ship.  I put some subminds into it.  
<BR>
Inactive.  They won't wake up until they get to Epsilon Eridani or wherever I 
<BR>
decide to spew them.  What have *I* lost in the process?  Essentially 
<BR>
nothing.  What do the &quot;colonists&quot; have to say about it?  Absolutely nothing.  
<BR>
Maybe they won't be happy when they wake up 100 light years from Daddy.  But 
<BR>
maybe they will - because I make them that way.  Either way, the motivations 
<BR>
you posit for not wanting to be cut off don't apply.
<BR>
<P>If I'd do this as an SI, so would at least some other SIs.  And it only takes 
<BR>
a spark to start a prairie fire and we're back with the logic of Robin's 
<BR>
&quot;Burning the Cosmic Commons&quot; and the basic problem of the Fermi Paradox.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  One way to look at it would be -- would the colonists have left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  England if they *knew* all they would ever be able to achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  would be a pale reflection of whatever England would come to be?
</EM><BR>
<P>Some would have.  Certainly the Quakers.  And probably others who felt 
<BR>
stifled by the class structure that made their immediate social surroundings 
<BR>
less attractive than life in &quot;the wilderness&quot;.
