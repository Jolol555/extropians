<EM>&gt;&gt; positions but I'm sure they are all things most Socialists of the period

<EM>&gt;&gt; would have supported or been concerned about)
</EM><BR>
<P>I have to ask - what's &quot;very bad&quot; about &quot;legalized&quot; birth control? Once 
<BR>
upon a time in America you could be arrested if unmarried and attempting to 
<BR>
buy a condom. Do you mean abortion?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;. If people had voted consistenly for major parties, this would not have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;happened. And if a Libertarian candidate consistently got 3%-10% of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;vote, and if (s)he ever broke the double digits, this certainly would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;lead to a Libertarianization of both wings of the Republicrat party. If 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;you voted for Browne, you would be contributing to this. I'd say that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;realistically I wouldn't even expect him to get 1% of the vote. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Nevertheless, one individual's vote for him is another grain of sand on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the scale. Your vote may be worth 0.0001% of the future policies of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;main parties.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Voting for either of the two main parties however, has absolutely zero 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;influence. If you vote for Bush or Gore, your vote is 100% worthless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and there's not even the slightest remotest chance it will contribute to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;anything. If your vote were the deciding vote, the vote would be close 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;enough that it would go to congress and they would decide it.
</EM><BR>
<P>It appears you are saying in the first paragraph that if everyone voted for 
<BR>
the Republicrats or Demicans, the socialist agenda would never have been 
<BR>
adopted by the mainstream - and then say that voting for either party now 
<BR>
has zero influence.
<BR>
<P>There is a slight, but significant pull of votes from the Republicans to 
<BR>
the Libertarians and Reform parties - but no symmetrical loss to the 
<BR>
Democrats - they get the labor vote, the teacher vote, etc. regardless of 
<BR>
what idiocy they expound. Perot indeed did spoil the election for the 
<BR>
Rebublicans - and we got Klinton.
<BR>
<P>If not for this, I would vote Libertarian in the next election - but I 
<BR>
consider the possibility of getting Gored just tooo scary - so I am voting 
<BR>
for Bush. Perhaps the state elections that bring in Libertarians - and 
<BR>
there should be at least a few who win, or show large voter turnout - will 
<BR>
moderate his and the next congress' thinking.
