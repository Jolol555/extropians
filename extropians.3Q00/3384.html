<EM>&gt;  I personally think we should keep the entire conversation intact, as is.  
</EM><BR>
We
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  know they're ridiculous, and I'd rather have a complete history to look 
</EM><BR>
back
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  on in 20 or 30 years, warts (and worse) and all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>No. Get rid of it. Now.
<BR>
<P>The Internet has search engines which can call up a name and an archive -- BY 
<BR>
SUBJECT. We wouldn't want this to pop up by someone doing research on this 
<BR>
topic. The lies shouldn't be allowed to stand, because someone might use them 
<BR>
someday later to their own purpose. Whoever the sick bastard is.
<BR>
<P>Actually, the lie is not as innocuous as it seems - posts can be quoted 
<BR>
without being researched. Here's how come I know this: 
<BR>
<P>One day I had the odd surprise of being told &quot;You're in Mensa's magazine.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Yep, that's right, anti-intellectual Queene. Naah.... but they showed me it. 
<BR>
<P>Some chick was writing and article about Sex and Intelligence. She must have 
<BR>
done a search for those two words, and Bingo: Some quip I tossed off one late 
<BR>
night probably, and had no memory of writing. Never aware they had a 
<BR>
publication. 
<BR>
<P>She listed QueeneMUSE from the ExI forum as a source *in her article* 
<BR>
(without my permission). I have no qualifications to speak about the subject, 
<BR>
but this seemed to make no difference to the readers or the writer.
<BR>
<P>I am sure this has happened to many of you.
<BR>
<P>If this can be done so casually - please, let's not let this fake &quot;fact&quot; 
<BR>
appear in any of our archives. It could only be harmful, not informative.
