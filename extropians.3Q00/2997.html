While I share some of your sentiments, I fail to see how an implant is going to
<BR>
succeed when green cards fail. How is an implant going to make sure illegals
<BR>
don't get jobs, when they get paid under the table most of the time (which means
<BR>
that $10k they make is actually worth the $16 a legal worker makes, because all
<BR>
that under the table cash is tax and SS free) with cash. Do you want to do away
<BR>
with cash? Sorry, not something I'm interested in.
<BR>
<P>Frankly, in todays economy, having people willing to still do grunt work for
<BR>
grunt work wages does not bother me at all. I can't find teenage kids anymore to
<BR>
mow the lawn, they are either always at camp or working at internet jobs (or at
<BR>
McDonalds for $9.00 an hour plus benies, no kidding). I don't want to be forced
<BR>
to hire a professional landscaper who has a degree in horticulture and charges
<BR>
$50 an hour. Thats like paying a heart surgeon to take a look at my sore throat.
<BR>
If you don't want so many immigrants wherever you are, send some up here to New
<BR>
Hampshire. There's plenty of work for them, unemployment is below 1% in my area.
<BR>
Yeah, yeah, mow your own lawn, you say. Frig, I only do non-job work myself if
<BR>
hiring someone else is more expensive than my own hourly rate.

<EM>&gt; I have a completely different take on implanted ID's: I hope we get them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and soon.&gt; &gt; You see, I see this country (USA) as our property; it's our asset. We all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; derive our living from it. The benefits from our work here accrue to us (in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large part).&gt; &gt; And even the taxes benefit us, if unevenly.&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that my view is not the commonly held one, but is is the one that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMO defines the situation best. The benefits accrue to this who live and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work here (although I agree that some do not work, when they could). But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some come here to &quot;steal&quot; the benefits that accrue to us, the owners. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may well come here to work, and there is work here, and often it is good.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That work is here because of the benefits of investing capital here versus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere else. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But that right --the right to our jobs, which are available here because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the qualities of this country (our property)--are available only to us, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; owners. Therefore many &quot;steal&quot; our property by working here, when they did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not &quot;buy in&quot;.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh, yes, they DO bring their brains, but the quality of brains varies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; widely. Some brains are well-educated, others are not, and many of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; riding the buses these says do not appear to want to be such (educated).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They have allowed the upper classes in their own countries to rob them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blind, and they will likely do so here as well. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many of these immigrants send much of their money home, to be spent in some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other country. Who benefits from these immigrants? The wealthy west side of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Houston certainly does! Now they can get a maid for $10,000/yr instead of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $16,000. Also, the tabs at the foo-foo westside eateries are not quite so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high, thanks to the cheap dishwashers. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can do without these benefits, myself. Convince me otherwise... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Until then, I say bring on the ID implants...
