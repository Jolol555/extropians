<P>The Palo Alto seventh day adventist church oftenasks me to teach
<BR>
a doctrine class, even tho I have stated very publicly there my
<BR>
atheism.  The atheist provides a very educational perspective
<BR>
for believers.  Im a very popular teacher there.  As we have
<BR>
pointed out before, the fundamentalist and the atheist are more
<BR>
or less adjacent to each other on the ideological scale. spike
