How prophetic that just a week or two ago I watched a Stossel show on
<BR>
&quot;What Has Happened To Free Speech In America&quot;. IMO he has pointed to a
<BR>
kind of &quot;administrative fascism&quot; under the guise of a democratic system
<BR>
and that is why they must stop him. This whole code of &quot;Totem and Taboo in
<BR>
America&quot; has gone too far and is destroying lives and careers. Isn't it
<BR>
time for Congress to conduct an investigation, starting with Stossel's
<BR>
program on the kind of tyranny against free speech which is being fostered
<BR>
especially by petty despots in academia? Let's start by examining those
<BR>
free speech codes on campuses. And let's not stop with the letter of those
<BR>
codes. Are they being SELECTIVELY enforced to the benefit of some and the
<BR>
detriment of others to add to the injustice which they perpetrate?

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; several readers have brought to my attention what appears to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; coordinated attack on John Stossel, intended to force his dismissal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; or at least permanently damage his standing at ABC. John Stossel is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the most influential libertarian journalist out there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Here's the background, per the Associated Press: In a segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; questioning the health benefits of organic foods, first aired in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; February and then repeated in July, Stossel reported that a test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; conducted on vegetable produce for ABC News found that there was no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; pesticide residue on either conventionally-grown samples or organic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; ones. But after an investigation, ABC concluded that no such test had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; been done.  ABC has stated that Stossel was relying on inaccurate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; information that had been provided by a staff member.  The segment's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; producer apparently mistakenly believed that a test done on chicken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; had also been done on vegetables.  The producer has reportedly been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; suspended for thirty days and Stossel himself will make an on-air
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; apology on Friday. (Hence the rescheduling of his documentary &quot;Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; America Number One?&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; In short, it was an innocent mistake that is being dealt with to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; highest standards of journalistic integrity.  We all know that much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; of what passes for news and information on television is tainted by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; more than just moments of uncharacteristic sloppiness, so this error
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; would hardly seem to justify a major response.  And yet this mistake
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; has stimulated a drumbeat for Stossel's dismissal, showing up both on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the ABC bulletin board site, and here and there in the press.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Why this kind of response?  Because Stossel has made a career out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; exposing hypocrisy and falsehood among some of the most powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; groups in America -- the eco-Left, the moralistic Right, trial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; lawyers, career politicians, and the media itself.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; arrayed against him a virtual who's who of modern collectivism.  No
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; wonder they call it a drumbeat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Why should you care about all this?  Because John Stossel isn't just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; another major libertarian TV journalist.  He's the *only* major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; libertarian TV journalist.  His recent free speech special commanded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; an audience of over 11 million.  His previous specials have touched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; upon and argued for decriminalization of victimless crimes (&quot;Sex,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Drugs &amp; Consenting Adults&quot;), defended capitalism (&quot;Greed&quot;), and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; exposed the self-serving nature of the child welfare system (&quot;Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Don't the Kids Have a Voice?&quot;).  These kinds of points are dear to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; the hearts of libertarians, and they are seldom seen elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; That's why it's important to voice your support.  Here are four ways to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; do so:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 1) Participate in ABC's online bulletin board on this subject.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; board is currently dominated by Stossel's enemies.  That's bad
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; because it may be seen as an indicator of public sentiment on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; subject.  The board is here: <A HREF="http://www.abcnews.go.com/onair/">http://www.abcnews.go.com/onair/</A>.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; (Select the &quot;Stossel: Organic Food Feedback&quot; link under LIVE EVENTS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; at the top.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 2) Send an email of support via the ABC feedback system.  You can do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; so here: <A HREF="http://www.abcnews.go.com/onair/email.html">http://www.abcnews.go.com/onair/email.html</A>.  (Be sure to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; select the &quot;John Stossel Reporting&quot; button.)  This only takes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; minute!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 3) Mail a letter of support regarding Stossel to ABC.  Physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; letters take more time but they're also taken more seriously for just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; that reason.  Here's the address:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Network Programming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; ABC Inc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 77 West 66th Street
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; New York, NY 10023
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 4) Forward this email to friends.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; There's a reason why attacks like this take place.  It's because they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; work.  Please take just a moment to voice your support for John
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Stossel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Thanks!
</EM><BR>
