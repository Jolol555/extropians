<P>
The reason insurance makes sense is that financial utility is
<BR>
nonlinear.  A $125,000 bill is much more than 1000 times as awful as a
<BR>
$125 bill, so it makes sense to pay $125 to offset a 1/2000 chance that
<BR>
you'll have a $125,000 bill.  It looks like the insurance company is
<BR>
scamming you, since they're making 50% profit.  Well, so they are.  But
<BR>
it's still a rational decision to buy the insurance.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, the utility of having $250,000 may be more than 50% the
<BR>
utility of having $500,000 - I personally would put it at 70% to 80%. 
<BR>
If you have a 50% chance of winning $500,000, it may make perfect sense
<BR>
to sell the ticket to someone for $200,000, even though it looks like
<BR>
you're &quot;losing money&quot; on the deal.  If you're a billionaire, of course,
<BR>
so that $250K makes no difference to your quality of life, then the
<BR>
utility of $250K is almost precisely 50% of the utility of $500K, and it
<BR>
makes sense to buy the ticket from me.
<BR>
<P>Because quality of life doesn't scale linearly with money, and because
<BR>
different individuals and corporations have different utility functions
<BR>
for gains or losses of a given quantity, there's room for mutually
<BR>
beneficial, utility-maximizing trades.  That's how insurance ought to
<BR>
work.  It's not about spreading risk between individuals, it's about
<BR>
spreading risk between probable futures.  From that perspective, there's
<BR>
nothing antisocial about having tightly partitioned groups.
