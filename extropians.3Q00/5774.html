<P><EM>&gt;  The best bad option is better than the rest, I suppose, and if seed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  AI ends up being the way that works then it certainly can't hurt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  program some affection into it. But it's rather like thinking a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  friendly, symbiotic, strain of bacteria is likely to eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  evolve into friendly people. The first few steps might preserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  something of our initial intent, but none of the well-meaning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intermediates is going to have any more luck anticipating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  behavior of a qualitatively better brain than you or I.
</EM><BR>
<P>We really can't *know* if a friendly strain of bacteria is likely to eventually
<BR>
evolve into friendly people without actually conducting an experiment along
<BR>
those lines. Plainly, such an experiment with artificial digital life forms
<BR>
would take minutes instead of millenia, so that's not a problem.
