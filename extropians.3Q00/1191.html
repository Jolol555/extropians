<EM>&gt; &gt;Nothing stopping people, except perhaps that they've already been taxed for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;as much money as they can afford to support the less responsive government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;system.  All this does is allow a narrower segment of the well-off to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;able to afford high-quality treatment than would otherwise be the case.

<EM>&gt; The welfare state is strangely enough more beneficial to the wealthiest in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society. They can still choose and demand quality, since they have the money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to pay for the service twice. Once for the coertive service, that they don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use, and second for the REAL service.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The rest of us are stuck with whatever we're given.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you didn't pay for it, you really can't complain whats given you, can you?
<BR>
BTW: The wealthy in welfare state countries typically don't get their quality
<BR>
health care there, they fly to the US and get it here, where they know people
<BR>
understand the link between quality service and the quantity of their pay. Even
<BR>
people who AREN'T wealthy typically come here to get treatment that is normally
<BR>
rationed in welfare states, whenever their life expectancy is anywhere near or
<BR>
longer than the average wait time (typically in years) for a procedure, they
<BR>
scrounge up the money wherever they can, come here, and get the work done on
<BR>
demand. Thus your welfare state health systems are externalizing the cost of the
<BR>
most expensive cases onto the consumer, much like any monopolist/mercantilist
<BR>
tries to externalize his costs onto the rest of society.
