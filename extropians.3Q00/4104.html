<P><EM>&gt;  Is it evil to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
</EM><BR>
<P>To be honest, sometimes, yes. Although evil is a big word, and highly 
<BR>
subjective.
<BR>
<P>I would instead suggest the term &quot;opportunistic.&quot; Like an infection that 
<BR>
wouldn't occur if the host was not weakened. If I go to you out desperation 
<BR>
and you use that as leverage, you can take advantage of me. This can be my 
<BR>
fault but it can also be can be manipulated in advance, by you, if you have 
<BR>
enough force, or power, so desperation is a manufactured tool used by large 
<BR>
powers against pre-weakened constituencies.
<BR>
<P>This is the meaning of the old union song &quot;I owe my soul to the company 
<BR>
store&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Use the example of a drug addict who's dealer begins with free samples, then 
<BR>
keeps raising the fix price but gives him credit (if he will steal or pimp 
<BR>
for him). Eventually he &quot;owns&quot; the addict. 
<BR>
<P>Or if I can isolate a person so that I pay his wages and I also control the 
<BR>
price of his living costs, I can always keep him just a little bit behind, so 
<BR>
he can't leave. I can extend credit to him. He would &quot;prefer that I did&quot;. Me 
<BR>
too. Otherwise what happenes? His family starves. This of course presupposes 
<BR>
that I am able to hog the market. In olden days small mining towns, for 
<BR>
example, I can make my goods the only goods available by burning down his 
<BR>
buildings or whatever. 
<BR>
Suppose today I'd just need billions of dollars and a politician's ear.
<BR>
<P>Even simpler, if I just plain say I'll break your legs if you don't let me 
<BR>
take advantage of you, you might say &quot;OK, I'd prefer you to&quot;.
