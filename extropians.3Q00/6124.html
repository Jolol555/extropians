<P>
This essay is a fantastically good piece of work, a really excellent
<BR>
summary of the phenomenon he's talking about.
<BR>
<P>He's also right that what he calls &quot;cybernetic totalism&quot; has no formal
<BR>
name; the name &quot;cybernetic totalism&quot; certainly won't catch on.  (He's
<BR>
using &quot;cybernetic&quot; to refer to the complex systems studied by Weiner,
<BR>
though I agree with Lanier in thinking that Weiner would be
<BR>
flabbergasted at what some people think can be done with his research.)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Here is a partial roster of the component beliefs of cybernetic totalism:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       1) That cybernetic patterns of information provide the ultimate and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;          best way to understand reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       2) That people are no more than cybernetic patterns.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       3) That subjective experience either doesn't exist, or is unimportant
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;          because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       4) That what Darwin described in biology, or something like it, is in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;          fact also the singular, superior description of all creativity and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;          culture.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       5) That qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;          information systems will be accelerated by Moore's Law.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; And finally, the most dramatic:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       6) That biology and physics will merge with computer science
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       (becoming biotechnology and nanotechnology), resulting in life and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       the physical universe becoming mercurial; achieving the supposed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       nature of computer software. Furthermore, all of this will happen
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       very soon! Since computers are improving so quickly, they will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       overwhelm all the other cybernetic processes, like people, and will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       fundamentally change the nature of what's going on in the familiar
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       neighborhood of Earth at some moment when a new &quot;criticality&quot; is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       achieved- maybe in about the year 2020. To be a human after that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       moment will be either impossible or something very different than we
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;       now can know.
</EM><BR>
<P>I found myself nodding to most of these, with some qualifications.
<BR>
<P>For example, I'd put more emphasis, in #3, on the idea that subjective
<BR>
experience is &quot;unimportant&quot; than on the idea that such experience does
<BR>
not exist.  There are a variety of ways that subjective experience
<BR>
(or, more to the point, the fact that we know basically nothing about
<BR>
subjective experience or how it comes about) could turn out to be
<BR>
unimportant: subjective experience might not exist, it might exist but
<BR>
fail to act causally on the world in any way, or it might just happen
<BR>
to follow along with anything that we'd call intelligence, as a sort
<BR>
of mysterious package deal.  It'd be &quot;unimportant&quot; because it would
<BR>
cast aside the only significant philosophical obstacle to artificial
<BR>
intelligence.
<BR>
<P>Similarly, I found myself marginally agreeing with #4, but only
<BR>
because he put in the caveat &quot;or something like it.&quot;  I don't think
<BR>
that memetic theory is a good way of describing most of our
<BR>
cognitions, though it works pretty well with some of them.  While
<BR>
evolution certainly made me, and thereby generated all my good ideas,
<BR>
I don't take evolution itself to be a very good way to approach most
<BR>
problems, though some sort of cybernetic &quot;spontaneous order&quot; approach,
<BR>
one with a whole ecology of &quot;thermostats,&quot; IS what I'd take to be the
<BR>
best descriptor of both creativity AND culture.
<BR>
<P>#5 won't be true unless and until we can cram human-equivalent
<BR>
intelligence into a computer, either via AI or uploading; this is to
<BR>
say that #5 is not true today, but will be.  (Of course, this can't
<BR>
happen unless creativity can be digitized and experience can be
<BR>
explained away.)
<BR>
<P>And #6, Singularity?  #6 happens at some point after #5 turns true.
<BR>
<P>OK, so, let's take a look at where he goes with this.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Cybernetic Totalist Belief #1: That cybernetic patterns of information
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; provide the ultimate and best way to understand reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Belief #1 appeared on the stage almost immediately with the first
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; computers. It was articulated by the first generation of computer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; scientists; Weiner, Shannon, Turing. It is so fundamental that it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; isn't even stated anymore within the inner circle. It is so well
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; rooted that it is difficult for me to remove myself from my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; all-encompassing intellectual environment long enough to articulate an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; alternative to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; An alternative might be this: A cybernetic model of a phenomenon can
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; never be the sole favored model, because we can't even build computers
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that conform to such models. Real computers are completely different
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; from the ideal computers of theory. They break for reasons that are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; not always analyzable, and they seem to intrinsically resist many of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; our endeavors to improve them, in large part due to legacy and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lock-in, among other problems. We imagine &quot;pure&quot; cybernetic systems
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; but we can only prove we know how to build fairly dysfunctional
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ones. We kid ourselves when we think we understand something, even a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; computer, merely because we can model or digitize it.
</EM><BR>
<P>The notion that cybernetics might be a good way to understand reality
<BR>
relies inherently on the idea that the laws of physics, such as they
<BR>
&quot;really&quot; are (or, at least, as close as we'll ever get) could be
<BR>
simulated on a sufficiently powerful computer/Turing machine, or a
<BR>
computer equipped with a random number generator.  This is certainly
<BR>
true of our physics now.  Some of us argue about whether we need the
<BR>
random number generator.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, barring a Kuhnian scientific revolution, no new
<BR>
scientific discovery is forthcoming which will change this, on account
<BR>
of our requirements that for something to count as a scientific
<BR>
discovery, it must make precise quantitative predictions as good as or
<BR>
better than its predecessor(s).  These quantitative predictions are
<BR>
described in our math, tested by our symbolic logic, and they can all
<BR>
be simulated on a computer of sufficient power.  No discovery arguing
<BR>
for non-computability could be considered scientific if presented
<BR>
today; we'd reject it out of hand.
<BR>
<P>Because, for non-computability to turn out to be true, the laws of
<BR>
physics would have to be totally undescribable by any logic with an
<BR>
algorithmic syntax.  For this to turn out to be right would require
<BR>
something deeply mystical about the laws of physics, far beyond our
<BR>
capacity to understand them or express them in any language.
<BR>
<P>The pragmatist in me says: &quot;If THAT'S what the laws of physics are
<BR>
like: uncomputable, undescribable, and unknowable, then I'LL never
<BR>
have to worry about those!&quot;  Lanier professes to be a kind of
<BR>
pragmatist; for his argument to hold, he'll have to argue from a
<BR>
pragmatic stance that the REAL laws of physics, despite the fact that
<BR>
we can never know about them or understand them, are non-computable in a
<BR>
rather rigorous way.  I can imagine a lot of different kinds of people
<BR>
holding a view like that, but not a pragmatist.
<BR>
<P>So, as it turns out, the best physics we'll ever get a handle on
<BR>
happens to be cybernetic in nature.  That's part of what Lanier calls
<BR>
the &quot;elegance&quot; of this view; it's also part of what worries him.  This
<BR>
concern is understandable.  We *should* worry that we're getting too
<BR>
proud of ourselves.  But, with that in mind, he'll have to take
<BR>
potshots at our current standard of what makes something &quot;scientific&quot;
<BR>
in order to make his supposedly &quot;pragmatist&quot; argument go through.  I
<BR>
just can't imagine how this argument would go.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; There is also an epistemological problem that bothers me, even though
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; my colleagues by and large are willing to ignore it. I don't think you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; can measure the function or even the existence of a computer without a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cultural context for it. I don't think Martians would necessarily be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; able to distinguish a Macintosh from a space heater.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why are we willing to ignore it?  Simple: &quot;cultural contexts&quot; happen
<BR>
within the laws of physics.  Not reduced to the laws of physics, but
<BR>
happening within them, failing to do anything which the laws of
<BR>
physics forbid.
<BR>
<P>But the cultural point might have some deeper validity than I'm
<BR>
currently giving credit.  I'd be hard pressed to explain why a theory
<BR>
that failed to make quantitative predictions would be worse than a
<BR>
theory which didn't, except by appealing to the cultural value
<BR>
itself.  We think it's important that our scientific theories make
<BR>
precise falsifiable predictions.  Our culture has largely agreed on
<BR>
this, and I see nothing exceptional with it.  But I can provide no
<BR>
better argument for it than that.
<BR>
<P>So, yes, our current ideas about what the laws of physics are, and
<BR>
even what could &quot;count&quot; as a competitor, are culturally determined.
<BR>
So are all of our other beliefs, to the pragmatist.  This outcome is
<BR>
uninteresting.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Belief #2: That people are no more than cybernetic patterns
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; We have caused the Turing test to be passed. There is no
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; epistemological difference between artificial intelligence and the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; acceptance of badly designed computer software.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have NO idea what the man's talking about here.
<BR>
<P>The Turing test is a kind of cultural trial by fire: it is the trial
<BR>
which a machine must pass before we'll accept it into our &quot;circle of
<BR>
empathy,&quot; as he calls it.  As a descriptive claim, I think it's
<BR>
basically right; once a computer can act like us in all of the
<BR>
relevant ways, it will have passed our little hazing ritual and made
<BR>
it into the Thinker's Club.  Sure, there will be some bigots who don't
<BR>
trust those &quot;bots,&quot; but the bigotry will end to the extent that the
<BR>
machines prove themselves as worthy members.  (Or maybe bots will kick
<BR>
us out.)
<BR>
<P>The Turing test is NOT the test to see when we'll &quot;put up with&quot; the
<BR>
technology at hand.  What the heck is he saying here?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The AI belief system is a direct explanation for a lot of bad software
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; in the world, such as the annoying features in Microsoft Word and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; PowerPoint that guess at what the user really wanted to type. Almost
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; every person I have asked has hated these features, and I have never
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; met an engineer at Microsoft who could successfully turn the features
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; completely off on my computer (running Mac Office '98), even though
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that is supposed to be possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah!  And EVERYBODY hates Google!  What morons they were, trying to
<BR>
design a system that would find RELEVANT hits for you.  Don't they
<BR>
know that trying to mimic what a human can do only results in bad
<BR>
software?  Don't they REALIZE that there's no difference between
<BR>
clicking on &quot;I feel lucky&quot; and accepting google.com as a moral agent?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Belief #3: That subjective experience either doesn't exist, or is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; unimportant because it is some sort of ambient or peripheral effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I propose to make use of a simple image to consider the alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; points of view. This image is of an imaginary circle that each person
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; draws around him/herself. We shall call this &quot;the circle of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; empathy&quot;. On the inside of the circle are those things that are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; considered deserving of empathy, and the corresponding respect,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; rights, and practical treatment as approximate equals.  On the outside
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of the circle are those things that are considered less important,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; less alive, less deserving of rights. (This image is only a tool for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; thought, and should certainly not be taken as my complete model for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; human psychology or moral dilemmas.) Roughly speaking, liberals hope
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to expand the circle, while conservatives wish to contract it.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; So let us pretend that the new Kant has already appeared and done
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; his/her inevitable work. We can then say: The placement of one's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; circle of empathy is ultimately a matter of faith. We must accept the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; fact that we are forced to place the circle somewhere, and yet we
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cannot exclude extra-rational faith from our choice of where to place
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very well.  Androids are the compelling argument for letting computers
<BR>
into your circle of empathy.  Androids that pass for humans.  Androids
<BR>
that don't know they're not born like regular people, who live lives,
<BR>
go to school, then go to work; androids who make love, make sacrifices
<BR>
for the people closest to them, follow their dreams, etc.  If you
<BR>
wish, cybernetic androids, with metal brains hooked up to bodies of
<BR>
flesh.
<BR>
<P>Now I suppose your 21st century Kant will calmly explain to these
<BR>
androids: &quot;You THINK you're a human, but you're not.  You've been
<BR>
designed as an android.  Therefore, you don't deserve moral
<BR>
consideration or practical treatment as an equal.  Sure, you're crying
<BR>
now and begging me not to take you away from your family, but you're
<BR>
only doing that because we PROGRAMMED you to do that!  You have no
<BR>
subjective feeling of terror at the thought of my enslaving you!  In
<BR>
fact, your words can't possibly MEAN anything, your thoughts can have
<BR>
no content, because you have no Intentionality with with to make them
<BR>
meaningful.  Take it away.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This is no Java applet, Lanier.  Androids like that DO get in my
<BR>
circle of empathy, as a matter of personal faith.  I'd say that
<BR>
there's something deeply incommensurable between your personal faith
<BR>
and mine if they don't get into yours.  I might even go as far as to
<BR>
say that your faith is so far from the norm as to be deranged and
<BR>
wrong.
<BR>
<P>You can't deny the possibility of androids that act like this;
<BR>
you don't.  So how can you not let them into the circle?  By what
<BR>
right of birth do you assert bigotry like that?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm going to skip Belief 4, since it's levied mostly against people
<BR>
who think memetics is a great way to model the whole brain, and
<BR>
against evolutionary psychologists, who he misinterprets as claiming
<BR>
that rape is good because it's natural.  (If anything, the correct
<BR>
conclusion to draw here is that nature is bad because rape is
<BR>
natural.)  I don't believe either of these are true.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; So, while I love Darwin, I won't count on him to write code.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me neither, though a more complex cybernetic algorithm (or
<BR>
computer+RNG) will do nicely.  I say that only because creativity
<BR>
happens under the laws of physics, so SOME computer or other can do
<BR>
the job.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Belief #5: That qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; information systems will be accelerated by Moore's Law.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said, this isn't true now.  It will be true later, when human
<BR>
equivalent AI or uploads happen.  Then, a qualitative increase in
<BR>
computing power means a quantitative increase in the number/speed of
<BR>
the people thinking about qualitative increases.  I have every reason
<BR>
to believe that this will result in rather rapid qualitative
<BR>
increases.
<BR>
<P>Then again, there might be something rather fundamentally hard about
<BR>
qualitative increases in intelligence.  If so, then #6, the
<BR>
Singularity, won't happen any time soon.  Immortality will come, but
<BR>
gradually.  The revolution won't be televised, it'll have to be
<BR>
remarked upon by historians looking backwards and saying: &quot;Look at how
<BR>
far we've come in such a short time!&quot;  I hope that Singularity happens
<BR>
sooner than later.  But I can't say for sure.
