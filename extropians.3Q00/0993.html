<EM>&gt; &gt; in the distribution of MP3 tracks for profit, it produces software that

<EM>&gt; &gt; they are charging a fee for the distribution of MP3 files via the Napster

<EM>&gt; &gt; software, which Metallica and the rest of the recording industry has not

<EM>&gt; &gt; able to prove.

<EM>&gt; As I understand it, you don't have to charge money to violate copyright,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just damage the author's ability to make money from their work by it's use.
</EM><BR>
<P>This isn't true. You have to be actively charging money for providing others
<BR>
with the specific enjoyment of its use and NOT paying Metallica or its record
<BR>
company a royalty. Playing Metallica in your backyard for a cookout is not a
<BR>
violation of copyright, even though your use of their CD in providing free music
<BR>
to other people who might not own their CD. The recording industry would love to
<BR>
force everyone to pay for every single instance that they listen to a song, but
<BR>
there is no practical means to force this, and that is not what copyright is
<BR>
for. Copyright protects the uncompensated copying of an officially published
<BR>
version of the music in any hard media format, like records, CDs, sheet music,
<BR>
etc. that is reproduced for the purposes of earning money for or via that
<BR>
reproduction. For example, when I was in the school band in high school, we once
<BR>
had to throw away all of our xeroxed copies of a Beatles tune and buy a copy of
<BR>
sheet music for each member of the band because a record company exec that
<BR>
attended one of our concerts had threatened a lawsuit if we didn't, simply
<BR>
because we charged admission for the concert. If the concert had been free, we
<BR>
would have been ok...
