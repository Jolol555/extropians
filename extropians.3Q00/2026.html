</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Yes, that's true.  Here's the issue, say that I trust anyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;borrows my copy not to sell it to anyone, nor to send it to anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;else without destroying the copy.  If I do that, then it is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;honest and legitimate transaction, and as long as it is reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that it is not observed simultaneously, then the copyright has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;been preserved and I can send my friend an mp3 (MPEG I Layer III
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;audio).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Putting on my juror hat (large black cone shaped wizard thing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starts and planets).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, you may loan it to your friend even as an MP3, You may not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give your friend a copy, it must be loaned with the intention of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; returning it. You may make one copy only, any additional copies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be violations, and yes, copies of a copy are also violations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;There is an issue about it being copied, but it appears that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;issue is how many people are listening to it at the same time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Consider, for example, if I had a collection of Savoy Brown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;albums, which perhaps few these days spend much time playing, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;perhaps not, I do not track them.  I might make ten thousand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;copies yet only one or less are listening to a copy at a time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So, it is about the music being freely copied, which is allowed as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we see by the availability of VHS and cassette tape recorders,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;along with the various other forms of audio dubbing, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;satisfactory precedence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;So, as long as any number of people make any number of copies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any recorded music that they have purchased and they make an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;effort in good faith to ensure that it is not being overplayed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;then they can trade their music.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't agree as I stated above, one copy for personnal use only.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The issue is indeed copying and distribution. It is my current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpretation that existing copyright law permits neither without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; permission.

<P>Hi,
<BR>
<P>I go to the code to see what it says about it.  I find a copy of U.S.
<BR>
Code Title 17 on the Internet
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/index.html">http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/index.html</A>.  It shows a last modified
<BR>
date of March 2000 on some articles.  Also
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.gpo.ucop.edu/catalog/uscode17usc.html">http://www.gpo.ucop.edu/catalog/uscode17usc.html</A>.
<BR>
<P>Here's an  interesting one:
<BR>
&quot;CHAPTER 10 - DIGITAL AUDIO
<BR>
§1002. Incorporation of copying controls
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prohibition on importation, manufacture, and
<BR>
distribution. No person shall import, manufacture, or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribute any digital audio recording device or
<BR>
digital audio interface device that does not conform to--&quot;
<BR>
<P>[ various copy control systems].  Basically, every single PC is
<BR>
infringent of this, as any one can copy any digital file exactly,
<BR>
although that might not apply as they are not dedicated digital sound
<BR>
systems, except for those for which they are.
<BR>
<P>I am looking for where it says what rights the purchasor who has paid
<BR>
for their music has with regards to making copies of it.  By fair use,
<BR>
copies of the works can be made as part of any kind of critical analysis
<BR>
of the work, although there is interpretable leeway in how much of the
<BR>
work can be copied.
<BR>
<P>Songs can be copyrighted (anyone ever pay &quot;Happy Brithday to You&quot;
<BR>
royalties?), as can signature elements of songs (presumably samples),
<BR>
perhaps even basslines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From Chapter 1,
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;§109. Limitations on exclusive rights: Effect of transfer of particular
<BR>
copy or phonorecord
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3),
<BR>
the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this
<BR>
title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the
<BR>
authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the
<BR>
possession of that copy or phonorecord.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Thus, once you buy a CD, cassette, minidisk, DVD, or vinyl album it is
<BR>
yours to do with as you please.  You can melt it or seal it in a vacuum,
<BR>
you can sell it, barter it, or give it away.
<BR>
<P>This leads me to turn to 106(3), the notwithstanding clause.  It's quite
<BR>
significant in this context:
<BR>
<P>&quot;§106. Exclusive rights in copyrighted works
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to sections 107 through 121, the owner of
<BR>
a copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to
<BR>
authorize any of the following: &quot;
<BR>
...
<BR>
&quot;(3)
<BR>
to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
<BR>
public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
<BR>
lending; &quot;
<BR>
<P>So, except in cases noted in sections 107 through 121, there can be no
<BR>
redistribution of the CD, and as we see 109(a) says the purchasor of the
<BR>
physical media can do with it as they please, largely.
<BR>
<P>Section 106 has further express copyrights, including
<BR>
<P>&quot; (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;&quot;
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>&quot;    (6) in the case of sound recordings, to perform the copyrighted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Section 106(6) would apply in our context except that we are talking
<BR>
about private transmission and play.
<BR>
<P>Section 107 is about fair use. Basically, a fair use implies
<BR>
non-commercial, non-entire, and non-market affecting use, open to
<BR>
interpretation.  You can still quote the lyrics.
<BR>
<P>This section appears to have some relevant information in this context:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/115.html">http://www.bitlaw.com/source/17usc/115.html</A>
<BR>
<P>What I hope to find is the wording on what personal copies are allowed.
<BR>
Physically, any digital media playback device will pass an
<BR>
interpretation of the data through various components of the device,
<BR>
thus copies exist.  I hope someone of a more scholarly bent can tell us
<BR>
what the actual rules are about copying purchased media.
<BR>
<P>Noone ever signed an agreement when they bought an album from the record
<BR>
store.
<BR>
<P>I think copyrights are good, but only to prevent actual commercial
<BR>
exploitation.  I think those on the commodity level are in it to make
<BR>
money off of the artists and consumers, and they are the primary
<BR>
proponents of even furtherly restrictive laws preventing the copying of
<BR>
bits.
<BR>
<P>I read about this some more.  Basically, my understanding was that more
<BR>
than one copy of the media can be made by the purchasor of the media for
<BR>
private use.
<BR>
<P>Even if not, there are ways to get about, and there could be an online
<BR>
web service where people can check in their albums when they are not
<BR>
listening to them, with a priority to check them back out personally
<BR>
when they would, thus that there could be a completely legal online
<BR>
music lending library with distributed contributors, if there isn't
<BR>
already.  Badda boom, badda bing.
