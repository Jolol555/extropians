<EM>&gt; I am baffled by this degree of faith in the power of information.  There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no evidence that people are so malleable.

<P>In further support of your comments, I'd add that malleability is one of the
<BR>
attributes of intelligence. Obstinacy (rather than malleability) is a
<BR>
characteristic of ignorance and/or stupidity.
<BR>
AI, and the SI that follows, will not cling to superstition, mythology, and
<BR>
belief systems as humans are wont to do. (Hurray!)

<P><P>“Truth is a pathless land”
<BR>
Man cannot come to it through any organization, through any creed, through any
<BR>
dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophic technique. He has to find
<BR>
it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents
<BR>
of his own mind, through observation and not through intellectual analysis or
<BR>
introspective dissection. Man has built in himself images as a fence of
<BR>
security - religious, political, personal. These manifest as symbols, ideas,
<BR>
beliefs. The burden of these images dominates man’s thinking, his relationships
<BR>
and his daily life. These images are the cause of our problems, for they divide
<BR>
man from man.
