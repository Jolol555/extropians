<EM>&gt;&gt;- - The criminal knows that you are armed, so preys on others instead. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;altercation &gt;between you is avoided altogether. (See Bastiat, &quot;What Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Seen And What Is Not Seen&quot;.)  &gt;If enough people are armed, the criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;finds something else to do for a living.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, criminals look for victims who won't put up a defensive fuss, that is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the unwarry, naive, physically weak, defenseless...    women and children?
</EM><BR>
<P>Criminals prey on the weak and defenseless.  Yes, women and children, but also
<BR>
the poor, of all colours and ethnic background, the aged, the infirm, the
<BR>
politically powerless.  Ghod help you if you are an elderly, black woman with 
<BR>
arthritis in a poor neighbourhood.  
<BR>
<P>There's a good book on the subject, edited by Don Kates -- _Restricting 
<BR>
Handguns: The Liberal Skeptics Speak Out_.  He gathered people with impeccable
<BR>
liberal credentials, from a variety of categories -- Hispanic, black, American
<BR>
Indian, female, Jewish, ACLU, etc. -- to write essays on behalf of gun rights.
<BR>
<P>It is the weak who are most in need of Sam Colt's &quot;Great Equalizer&quot;, to 
<BR>
defend themselves against two-legged predators.  
<BR>
<P>I wonder what would happen if the NRA or GOA set up shop, offering free firearms 
<BR>
training to Watts, the South Bronx, and Roxbury?  Perhaps initially restricted to 
<BR>
women and to men over 60?  Perhaps selling them concealable firearms at cost?
<BR>
<P>Imagine the reaction from the general public, gun control advocates, the target 
<BR>
community, and self-appointed blowhard representatives of the target community.
<BR>
<P>Now, imagine the NRA program is co-sponsored by AARP, NOW, and NAACP.
<BR>

[ Context for non-US readers:  ACLU = American Civil Liberties Union, NRA =
<BR>
National Rifle Association, GOA = Gun Owners of America, AARP = American 
<BR>
Association of Retired Persons, NOW = National Organization for Women, NAACP =
<BR>
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Watts (Los Angeles), 
<BR>
the South Bronx (New York), and Roxbury (Boston) are all relatively dangerous,
<BR>
poor, minority neighbourhoods.  Watts was the site of massive riots in 1968. ]
