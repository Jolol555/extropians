<P>Fearing Control by Microsoft , China Backs the Linux System
<BR>
<P>By CRAIG S. SMITH
<BR>
<P>HANGHAI, July 6 -- Janet Reno is not the only one worried about Bill 
<BR>
Gates's software monopoly. China's leaders are, too.
<BR>
<P>They are concerned that the country is growing overly dependent on 
<BR>
the Windows operating system, which controls computers running 
<BR>
everything from banks to President Jiang Zemin's e-mail box. But the 
<BR>
Chinese government, itself a master at monopoly, is taking its case 
<BR>
against Microsoft not to the courtroom but to the marketplace, albeit 
<BR>
with a bit of administrative fiat. It is backing the Linux operating 
<BR>
system, which was created by a Finnish university student in 1991 and 
<BR>
is distributed free to anyone.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We don't want one company to monopolize the software market,&quot; said 
<BR>
Chen Chong, a deputy minister of information industries who oversees 
<BR>
the computer industry in China. With Linux, &quot;we can control the 
<BR>
security,&quot; he added, so &quot;we can control our own destiny.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A growing number of Chinese have likened dependence on Microsoft to 
<BR>
leaving the keys to the country's increasingly computerized economy 
<BR>
in the hands of a potential enemy. Some warn that secret holes in 
<BR>
Microsoft's computer code might allow the United States access to 
<BR>
Chinese networks or even enable it, in time of war, to shut those 
<BR>
networks down.
<BR>
<P>Such concerns were only heightened last year when a cryptographer for 
<BR>
a Canadian software firm working in the United States said he had 
<BR>
found a feature in Windows called an NSAKey -- as in National 
<BR>
Security Agency, the United States government agency that gathers 
<BR>
electronic signal intelligence worldwide. Though Microsoft said the 
<BR>
key was innocuous and no support has been found for any sinister 
<BR>
explanation, &quot;no one can guarantee that Windows does not have back 
<BR>
doors,&quot; said Liu Bo, a former Microsoft executive who is now chief 
<BR>
executive of Red Flag, a government-backed company set up to create 
<BR>
software based on Linux and to encourage a homegrown software 
<BR>
industry.
<BR>
<P>In addition, various arms of the government have been warning of the 
<BR>
security risk posed by the country's reliance on Microsoft. &quot;Without 
<BR>
information security, there is no national security in politics, 
<BR>
economics and military affairs,&quot; declared an editorial in People's 
<BR>
Liberation Army Daily earlier this year.
<BR>
<P>Microsoft calls such fears nonsense and says it continues to enjoy a 
<BR>
strong working relationship with the government. &quot;We have shared 
<BR>
product information with them,&quot; said Michael Rawding, Microsoft's 
<BR>
regional director in China, &quot;and I believe that their comfort with 
<BR>
our product information led them to allow the launch&quot; of Windows 
<BR>
2000, Microsoft's new business-oriented operating system, in China 
<BR>
last spring.
<BR>
<P>Unlike the Windows source code, which Microsoft keeps secret, the 
<BR>
Linux code is open for all to see and is freely distributed with the 
<BR>
stipulation that anybody can improve it as long as any modifications 
<BR>
are shared with the rest of the world. The almost communistic &quot;from 
<BR>
each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; 
<BR>
approach appeals to China's Marxist leaders.
<BR>
<P>Despite the government's stand, no one is suggesting that Microsoft 
<BR>
is finished in China. Though it will not provide specific sales 
<BR>
figures, the company says its software sales in China surged 80 
<BR>
percent last year and continue to grow. But the government's move to 
<BR>
diversify reflects a broader dissatisfaction with the company and its 
<BR>
founder, Mr. Gates, who just a few years ago was hailed as a hero by 
<BR>
China's young technology enthusiasts.
<BR>
<P>The turning point in Microsoft's image was the introduction of its 
<BR>
Chinese-language Windows 95 operating system, which was programmed to 
<BR>
display references to &quot;Communist bandits&quot; and to exhort users to 
<BR>
&quot;take back the mainland.&quot; Beijing, infuriated to learn that Microsoft 
<BR>
had used computer programmers in Taiwan to write the software, 
<BR>
demanded that the company hire mainland programmers to fix it.
<BR>
<P>Chief among the company's critics is its former general manager for 
<BR>
China, Juliet Wu, who has become a national celebrity with her 
<BR>
withering, best-selling expos&amp;#0233;, &quot;Up Against the Wind: 
<BR>
Microsoft, I.B.M. and Me.&quot; The picture she paints of Microsoft as an 
<BR>
arrogant Goliath feeds into the irritation many Chinese computer 
<BR>
users feel toward the company.
<BR>
<P>Ms. Wu and other critics say Microsoft's pricing -- a software 
<BR>
program can cost as much as an average office worker's monthly salary 
<BR>
-- forces users to buy pirated copies of the company's software. (The 
<BR>
Business Software Alliance, a nonprofit trade group, estimates that 
<BR>
as much as 95 percent of all software in China is pirated, though the 
<BR>
industry hopes China's expected admission to the World Trade 
<BR>
Organization will change that.)
<BR>
<P>Liu Dongli, an Internet entrepreneur in the southern province of 
<BR>
Fujian, was so enraged by having to pay $241 for Windows 98 that he 
<BR>
sued the company for unfair pricing. The suit was withdrawn when Mr. 
<BR>
Liu realized that Microsoft charges no more for its products in China 
<BR>
than it does elsewhere. &quot;But that doesn't mean we lost the case,&quot; he 
<BR>
fumed, vowing to bring suit again when he has more evidence. 
<BR>
&quot;Monopoly is not a good thing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The news media, meanwhile, have criticized Microsoft for suing a 
<BR>
company last year over the sale of pirated software. Microsoft, which 
<BR>
was asking for $200,000 in damages, lost the case because the Chinese 
<BR>
court ruled that it had sued the wrong company. The defeat only 
<BR>
darkened Microsoft's ominous silhouette in the eyes of many Chinese.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Microsoft is a bully,&quot; said Hua Yuqing, a young Internet 
<BR>
entrepreneur, who complains that Microsoft's high prices and 
<BR>
proprietary computer code squelch creativity. He is building a 
<BR>
business creating software programs that run on Linux. &quot;I don't want 
<BR>
to feel that I'm subconsciously controlled,&quot; Mr. Hua said, referring 
<BR>
to the dependence on Microsoft that comes with using its products.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Hua and a half-dozen computer programmers peck away at their 
<BR>
keyboards here in a drab office empty except for computers, desks, 
<BR>
chairs and a shelf stocked with bottles of orange soda and boxes of 
<BR>
chocolate milk. He and his colleagues are using Linux to start a 
<BR>
company that provides services to subscribers over the Internet -- in 
<BR>
this case, the use of accounting software and sales-tracking 
<BR>
software. The software stays on Mr. Hua's server computer, and 
<BR>
customers rent it rather than buy their own.
<BR>
<P>Microsoft's public relations disaster has been a boon for Linux. So 
<BR>
far, several companies -- including Red Flag, which is backed by 
<BR>
President Jiang's son, Jiang Mianhang, and TurboLinux, based in San 
<BR>
Francisco -- have introduced Chinese-language versions of the Linux 
<BR>
operating system in China. Many other companies have started to 
<BR>
provide software and services for China's Linux users.
<BR>
<P>The Chinese government tried for more than a decade to develop an 
<BR>
operating system of its own, but was unable to keep up with the 
<BR>
fast-changing industry. Linux gives the country the tools to build 
<BR>
that system now -- and, in the Chinese view, the fact that the Linux 
<BR>
code is not privately held assures that any security it wants to 
<BR>
build into its computer systems will not have undetectable 
<BR>
vulnerabilities.
<BR>
<P>But even Linux enthusiasts profess ambivalence about the government's 
<BR>
interest. Linux developers in China say some overseas colleagues 
<BR>
worry that China may not play by the rules for collaborating and 
<BR>
sharing and may adapt Linux to create a proprietary system instead.
<BR>
<P>In any case, China represents a market potential of such size, and 
<BR>
government influence over the market is still so strong, that 
<BR>
Beijing's support can turn almost any product into an industry 
<BR>
standard domestically. By the end of next year, the country may well 
<BR>
be the third-largest PC market in the world, and software sales are 
<BR>
expected to grow more than 30 percent a year for the foreseeable 
<BR>
future.
<BR>
<P>As China's economy becomes increasingly integrated with that of the 
<BR>
region and the world, much of Asia is likely to follow its lead.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Liu, the chief executive of Red Flag, says a third of the 
<BR>
country's Internet servers -- the computers that power Web sites -- 
<BR>
are already using Linux operating systems. He estimates that by the 
<BR>
end of next year Linux will run half of all servers in China and as 
<BR>
much as a third of the country's desktop computers.
<BR>
<P>Those estimates may be overblown; the technology research firm IDC 
<BR>
Asia-Pacific says its data shows less than 3 percent of all servers 
<BR>
shipped to China last year were loaded with Linux. But IDC expects 
<BR>
the number to more than double this year, and Linux's real market 
<BR>
share is most certainly higher because the operating system can be 
<BR>
downloaded free from the Internet.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Linux, without doubt, has gained some headway among software 
<BR>
developers in China,&quot; Mr. Rawding said. &quot;However, I have yet to see 
<BR>
any mission-critical organization deploy Linux because the truth of 
<BR>
the matter is that in businesses, you want the support and service to 
<BR>
be available to you instantly when something does go wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Nonetheless, Great Wall Computer, one of China's biggest PC makers, 
<BR>
has already shipped 200,000 desktop computers loaded with the Linux 
<BR>
operating system, which looks much like Windows though it cannot yet 
<BR>
match all of Microsoft's features.
<BR>
<P>Ma Li, marketing chief at Great Wall, says his company shifted toward 
<BR>
Linux at Beijing's urging. &quot;As a leading enterprise,&quot; he said, &quot;we 
<BR>
should respond to the call of the government.&quot;
