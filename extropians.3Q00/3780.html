<P>Title:          Biological Utilisation of Quantum NonLocality[1]
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Abstract: The perception of reality by biosystems is based on
<BR>
different, and in certain respects more effective principles than
<BR>
those utilised by the more formal procedures of science.  As a
<BR>
result, what appears as random pattern to the scientific method can
<BR>
be meaningful pattern to a living organism.  The existence of this
<BR>
complementary perception of reality makes possible in principle
<BR>
effective use by organisms of the direct interconnections between
<BR>
spatially separated objects shown to exist in the work of J.S. Bell.
<BR>
<P>1. INTRODUCTION
<BR>
<P>Bell(1,2)[4] has given arguments that appear to demonstrate
<BR>
the existence of direct interconnections between spatially separated
<BR>
objects.  But at the same time there are arguments(4-6) that appear
<BR>
to show that no real physical manifestations of these
<BR>
interconnections actually exist. The thesis developed in this paper
<BR>
is that it is only from the point of view of quantum mechanics that
<BR>
these connections appear to be unphysical, and that there is a
<BR>
different, complementary point of view, one associated specifically
<BR>
with the activities of living organisms, in terms of which the
<BR>
interconnections may be very concretely real, and capable of being
<BR>
put to practical use.
<BR>
<P>The logic of the complementary point of view to which
<BR>
reference has just been made is that the activities of living
<BR>
organisms are governed by predominant principles (survival, and
<BR>
optimality of the conditions of life) different to those of the
<BR>
scientist (conformity to certain restrictions that are considered
<BR>
necessary for &quot;good&quot; science).  The perceptual processes of
<BR>
organisms (e.g. processes such as vision) perform their functions in
<BR>
general very effectively, but in a way that is hard to delineate in
<BR>
rigorous scientific terms.  It will be argued that as a result of
<BR>
this difference the knowledge possessed by biosystems and the
<BR>
knowledge possessed by science are qualitatively different, leading
<BR>
to an ability of life to make use of Bell's non-locality in a way
<BR>
that is not possible in the different situation of a controlled
<BR>
scientific experiment.
<BR>
<P>The discourse that follows begins (Sec. 2) with a review of
<BR>
Bell's theorem, discussing in particular the antithesis between the
<BR>
way that Bell's argument appears to demonstrate the existence of
<BR>
direct action at a distance, while at the same time quantum
<BR>
calculations lead to the result that any such effects will disappear
<BR>
under statistical averaging.  Experiments on certain unusual human
<BR>
abilities(7,8) suggest that the non-local effects do not invariably
<BR>
disappear under averaging, a result that the present paper seeks to
<BR>
explain.
<BR>
<P>The explanation proposed here involves the issue of exactly
<BR>
what kind of randomness is being presupposed when one performs such
<BR>
statistical averaging.  An answer to this question in general terms
<BR>
is provided by causal (non-statistical) models of the phenomena of
<BR>
the quantum realm such as that of Bohm(9).  This kind of
<BR>
interpretation assumes the relevance of particular probability
<BR>
distributions in an appropriate phase space.  The possibility that
<BR>
one needs in general to deal with coexisting multiple
<BR>
representations of reality (complementarity) is then considered, the
<BR>
implication being that different kinds of probability distributions
<BR>
to those relevant to quantum mechanical predictions may be
<BR>
appropriate in cases such as those involving biosystems.  From the
<BR>
point of view of a biosystem itself, this possibility translates
<BR>
into one that biosystems can have more discriminative knowledge of
<BR>
nature than is obtainable by quantum measurement.  As a result of
<BR>
this higher degree of discrimination, the evolutionary and
<BR>
developmental processes characteristic of biosystems can, given
<BR>
suitable initial conditions, lead to focussed probability
<BR>
distributions that make possible the kind of human abilities (i.e.
<BR>
psi functioning) to which reference has been previously made.
<BR>
<P>2. BELL'S THEOREM AND NONLOCAL CONNECTIONS
<BR>
<P>We first review Bell's theorem.  Its domain of relevance is
<BR>
of a type of system, which we shall refer to here as an EPR-type
<BR>
system, first discussed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen(10).
<BR>
EPR-type systems are systems wherein a quantum object breaks up into
<BR>
parts which after separating are observed by measuring instruments
<BR>
that have no links of a type that can transmit information by normal
<BR>
means to each other.  A typical example of such a system, which has
<BR>
been studied experimentally(11), involves measurement of the
<BR>
correlated polarisations of the photons emitted in a two-photon
<BR>
decay sequence. Bell's theorem consists of an inequality applicable
<BR>
to the correlations observed in a range of different measurements,
<BR>
and from it one can derive the corollary that no local model of
<BR>
physical reality can exist whose statistical predictions would be in
<BR>
agreement with those of quantum mechanics: in Bell's own words(1),
<BR>
if nature behaves in accordance with the statistical predictions of
<BR>
quantum mechanics then &quot;there must be a mechanism whereby the
<BR>
setting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another
<BR>
instrument, however remote&quot;.  Experimental results, while not being
<BR>
totally conclusive, are such as to point towards this conclusion
<BR>
being valid.
<BR>
<P>The existence of such remote influences or connections is
<BR>
suggested more directly by experiments on phenomena such as
<BR>
telepathy (the direct connection of one mind with another) and
<BR>
psychokinesis (the direct influence of mind on matter), both of
<BR>
which are examples of so-called psi functioning or psychic
<BR>
phenomena.  The reader interested in learning about these phenomena
<BR>
(which are often disregarded by orthodox science) is referred to the
<BR>
recent article by Radin and Nelson(8) which analyses experiments
<BR>
relating to them, as well as to the references cited therein (and
<BR>
especially those relating to the publications of R.G. Jahn and
<BR>
collaborators, and of H. Schmidt), and to Ref. 7[5].
<BR>
<P>3. DO THE INTERCONNECTIONS PERSIST UNDER STATISTICAL AVERAGING?
<BR>
<P>Ordinary quantum mechanical calculations, if one excludes
<BR>
from consideration proposals such as that of Walker(12) that contain
<BR>
special ad hoc modifications to the conventional theory, do not seem
<BR>
to provide any clear mechanism leading to the occurrence of
<BR>
phenomena where the effects of non-local connections are manifested
<BR>
directly. Indeed, conventional quantum mechanical calculations(4,5)
<BR>
suggest that whatever effects changing the setting of a measuring
<BR>
device may have on _individual_ remote events, the _statistical
<BR>
distribution_ of such events remains unaltered.  Mermin(6) concludes
<BR>
as a result that &quot;The manifestation of this 'action at a distance'
<BR>
is revealed only through a comparison of the data independently
<BR>
gathered at A and at B&quot; (the locations of the two measuring
<BR>
instruments).  He characterises the measurements carried out at the
<BR>
remote location as being &quot;entirely random&quot;.
<BR>
<P>But what is &quot;entirely random&quot;?  What appears to be random in
<BR>
a given situation depends on the context, on what one knows and on
<BR>
one's point of view. Coded messages, the roll of a die, output from
<BR>
a computer, or the movements of a person operating a piece of
<BR>
machinery may all appear random if one does not know the relevant
<BR>
details (the code that is used in the coded message, the exact
<BR>
manner in which the die is thrown, what the computer program or
<BR>
piece of machinery is and what it is doing) and yet if one knows
<BR>
this information many of the details of such phenomena can be
<BR>
understood. An alternative description of microphysical reality to
<BR>
that provided by quantum mechanics, if any such exists, may be
<BR>
associated with a different kind of statistical average.  What seems
<BR>
to be noise may no longer be noise, and the theorem implying no
<BR>
manifestations of interconnectedness for the statistical average may
<BR>
no longer apply.
<BR>
<P>But do situations actually exist in nature whose
<BR>
descriptions involve less randomness in particular aspects than
<BR>
quantum mechanics implies?  In the past, it might have been stated
<BR>
unconditionally that von Neumann had under very general conditions
<BR>
disproved the existence of such a possibility, but it is now
<BR>
recognised(13) that the supposed proofs of these assertions
<BR>
contained assumptions that are in fact unjustifiable.  There exist
<BR>
arguments(14-17) that complementary descriptions to those of quantum
<BR>
mechanics can and in all probability do occur. Detailed discussion
<BR>
of this issue will play a central role in the analysis that follows.
<BR>
<P>4. CAUSAL INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
<BR>
<P>In the context of the present problem it is useful to think
<BR>
in terms of causal interpretations of quantum mechanics.  These are
<BR>
models where the observed indeterminacy is a consequence of
<BR>
uncertainty of the actual state of a system whose dynamical laws in
<BR>
themselves are completely deterministic.  Bohm's causal model(9)
<BR>
involves an ensemble of particles distributed in phase space with a
<BR>
particular self-consistent probability distribution function and
<BR>
moving in accordance with certain deterministic laws.  The
<BR>
statistical predictions of quantum mechanics are reproduced exactly
<BR>
in a way that avoids the usual introduction of unclear and arbitrary
<BR>
assumptions concerning measurement, wave function collapse, or
<BR>
separation of a system into observer and observed.  The non-locality
<BR>
which Bell showed to be implicit in quantum mechanics is _explicit_
<BR>
in Bohm's causal model, in that the motion of the particles in the
<BR>
model is governed by an interaction, determined by the quantum wave
<BR>
function of the system, that is non-local.
<BR>
<P>In most common situations, averaging over the particle
<BR>
positions in the causal model makes the mean direct influence of one
<BR>
particle on another at large distances negligibly small. This is not
<BR>
so, however, in EPR-type situations where the wave function has a
<BR>
non-decomposability property which makes this interaction at a
<BR>
distance significantly different from zero even at long range(13).
<BR>
But, even in these situations, once we take an ensemble average,
<BR>
using the special distribution function in phase space that assures
<BR>
the statistical equivalence of the causal interpretation and quantum
<BR>
mechanics, we revert to the quantum mechanical prediction that
<BR>
statistically no influence at a distance can be demonstrated.  One
<BR>
may ask, however, why only these special distribution functions
<BR>
should apply.  Is there anything absolute about the ignorance
<BR>
implicit in the use of these particular distribution functions? The
<BR>
argument will be made in the following that other distribution
<BR>
functions, with different statistical properties, are relevant in
<BR>
other contexts, especially those associated with life.
<BR>
<P>Situations where a change in context leads to a new kind of
<BR>
statistical distribution becoming relevant are indeed commonplace in
<BR>
science: they occur for example whenever a phase transition occurs
<BR>
that leads to a breaking of symmetry.  As a result of symmetry
<BR>
breaking, statistical distributions that are &quot;asymmetric&quot; with
<BR>
regard to this symmetry may come into existence in situations where
<BR>
previously only symmetric distributions were observable or relevant.
<BR>
Analogously, it can be anticipated that special situations will
<BR>
exist whose natural description involves probability distributions
<BR>
other than the particular ones that arise in the &quot;quantum
<BR>
formalism&quot;.
<BR>
<P>5. MULTIPLE DESCRIPTIONS OF REALITY
<BR>
<P>We now discuss in some detail this idea that rather than a
<BR>
single, universal, description of reality (such as that provided by
<BR>
quantum mechanics) being appropriate in all circumstances, more than
<BR>
one complementary or alternative form of knowledge may exist(14-17).
<BR>
This state of affairs is most simply understood with reference to a
<BR>
special feature of the quantum domain related to quantum
<BR>
indeterminism, which we shall characterise as the _loss of universal
<BR>
determinism_.  This latter term is intended to reflect the fact that
<BR>
in this domain quantum indeterminism renders impossible the making
<BR>
of exact predictions on the basis of a _universal formula_ (which
<BR>
would be possible in principle in classical physics if the relevant
<BR>
dynamical laws such as Maxwell's equations or Newton's laws were
<BR>
known).  We hypothesise that two alternative strategies are possible
<BR>
for dealing with the loss of universal determinism. The first, the
<BR>
method of science, is to retain conformity with the demands of
<BR>
reproducibility and universality by the device of replacing the no
<BR>
longer possible strict determinism by _statistical determinism_.
<BR>
The outcome of this approach is quantum mechanics.  The second, a
<BR>
method that is in general terms favoured by life, involves
<BR>
renouncing the demand for universal knowledge in favour of more
<BR>
specialised and purposeful adaptations to the more limited class of
<BR>
situations that the organism or organisms concerned is liable
<BR>
_naturally_ to encounter in the course of its life.  A human being
<BR>
learns, for example, the language that is spoken in his or her own
<BR>
particular environment, rather than language in general.
<BR>
<P>These two strategies lead in different directions.  The
<BR>
strategy of science leads towards the accurate specification of
<BR>
form, while that of life leads in the direction of meaning.  These
<BR>
two directions, form and meaning, are the two components of David
<BR>
Bohm's concept relating to the universal nature of things,
<BR>
_soma-significance_(18).  Meaning is an aspect of reality tied to
<BR>
the achievement of goals and to specific context that is
<BR>
sufficiently subtle and complex as not to be representable by any
<BR>
closed formula. Furthermore, the technique of statistical averaging
<BR>
is especially irrelevant in the context of meaning, since its
<BR>
influence in general is to transform the _meaningful_ into the
<BR>
_meaningless_.  It is not useful to consider the meaning of a
<BR>
particular word averaged over all languages, and computing the
<BR>
statistics of word order and frequency in a discourse tells one very
<BR>
little about the meaning of the discourse.  Investigations into
<BR>
meaning(18,19) are investigations in a different direction to that
<BR>
in which one is led by scientific investigations into reproducible
<BR>
form.
<BR>
<P>But science is involved with the accurate specification of
<BR>
form, and this enforces the kind of _formal_ specification of nature
<BR>
characteristic of quantum measurement theory.  This contrasts with
<BR>
the philosophical informality of classical physics with its naive
<BR>
realism.  The perceptual and interpretative processes of living
<BR>
organisms do not admit of the formal specifications demanded by
<BR>
quantum measurement theory.  Therefore, as discussed in Ref. 17,
<BR>
there is no good reason to identify the class of experiments defined
<BR>
according to the precepts of quantum measurement theory with the
<BR>
category of all investigable phenomena.  Indeed, the quantum
<BR>
formalism does not apply in any obvious way to _natural_ situations,
<BR>
situations such as those of the phenomena of life that come into
<BR>
being by chance rather than by scientific design, and the common
<BR>
belief that it should be possible in some way to apply quantum
<BR>
mechanics to natural situations just as readily as to the controlled
<BR>
experiment is one that seems to owe its existence to an
<BR>
extrapolation that cannot, under close examination, be justified.
<BR>
<P>6. RANDOMNESS AND FOCUSSING
<BR>
<P>These arguments lead us to the conclusion that, because of
<BR>
the different kind of perceptual and interpretative processes
<BR>
characteristic of life compared with those of science, living
<BR>
organisms can possess knowledge that is more detailed in certain
<BR>
aspects than is the knowledge specified by the quantum theory.  One
<BR>
may talk in terms of higher discrimination and selectivity, which
<BR>
improvements can be attributed a different kind of contact with
<BR>
nature. By way of analogy, it can be compared to a process that
<BR>
makes contact with individual atoms, relative to one that makes
<BR>
contact with the macroscopic aspects of a system only.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the point of view of a causal model such as that of
</EM><BR>
Bohm's, alternative kinds of probability distribution in phase space
<BR>
become relevant. In general terms, these distributions can be
<BR>
characterised as being highly focussed in relation to the organism's
<BR>
specific goals.  Such focussed behaviour in living organisms is
<BR>
typified by, for example, the activities of a tightrope walker, or
<BR>
of a darts player.  Efficient focussing comes into being naturally
<BR>
over the course of time as the consequence of processes of trial and
<BR>
error learning occurring during the developmental process.  Our
<BR>
assumption in relation to psi functioning is that here also the
<BR>
relevant probability distributions are highly focussed in relation
<BR>
to goals, in a way that may become more effective over time as
<BR>
development through learning takes place.
<BR>
<P>6.1.  AN ILLUSTRATION
<BR>
<P>The kind of focussing process involved can be illustrated
<BR>
with a simple example.  This consists of a coil attached by a length
<BR>
of wire to an ammeter a short distance away.  The meter needle can
<BR>
be caused to deflect by moving a magnet in the vicinity of the coil.
<BR>
A person who does not understand the facts of magnetism and
<BR>
attempting to produce a meter deflection in a particular direction
<BR>
will at first move the magnet randomly and hence produce deflections
<BR>
in a random direction.  But he may in time discover the principle
<BR>
that is involved and utilise the magnet in a non-random way, and
<BR>
gain thus the ability to produce deflections in a prescribed
<BR>
direction at will.  In exemplification of the processes discussed
<BR>
above, his learning process changes an initially random distribution
<BR>
of magnet movements into one focussed with regard to the goal, the
<BR>
principles referred to above. The proposal being made here is
<BR>
essentially that mechanisms of a similar kind may be operative at a
<BR>
_microscopic_ level in biosystems.
<BR>
<P>7. SPECULATIVE MODELS
<BR>
<P>In the biological world, evolution through natural selection
<BR>
tends to give rise to adaptive elaborations of preexisting
<BR>
phenotypes (manifest behaviour).  Thus a primitive sensitivity to
<BR>
light becomes elaborated into more discriminating sensitivities and
<BR>
ultimately into fully detailed vision.  In the case of psi one may
<BR>
similarly anticipate the development of forms of organisation of the
<BR>
nervous system capable of interacting non-locally with other
<BR>
systems.  Such organisation has been discussed by C.N. Villars(20),
<BR>
who starts with the assumption that in a number of types of
<BR>
situation encountered in a quantum mechanical context, including
<BR>
EPR-type situations, microphysical objects function as &quot;centres of
<BR>
perception&quot;, acting as if sensitive to non-local information.
<BR>
Villars hypothesises that somewhere within the nervous system forms
<BR>
of organisation of microphysical objects exist capable of
<BR>
amplifying, selecting and combining the perceptions through
<BR>
non-local connections of individual microphysical objects, in a way
<BR>
analogous to the way in which the ordinary senses function through
<BR>
the working together of many subunits.  As a result we can have
<BR>
perceptions of distant objects and events through the non-local
<BR>
connections in the same kind of way as we acquire perception of the
<BR>
more local environment through the ordinary senses.  The scope and
<BR>
form of such perceptions at a distance would be a function of the
<BR>
particular forms of organisation and activity present in these
<BR>
postulated sense-like processes.  Except for the absence of a
<BR>
theoretical mechanism for overcoming the limitations of ordinary
<BR>
quantum descriptions by making use of an underlying causal model,
<BR>
Villars' proposals are similar to those advocated here.
<BR>
<P>Further similar proposals have been made by Bohm(21) also,
<BR>
based on his causal interpretation.  His conclusion is that while,
<BR>
in principle, coherent non-local effects of one system upon another
<BR>
are possible, in practice such connections are &quot;fragile, and easily
<BR>
broken by almost any disturbance or perturbation&quot;, and that they
<BR>
would occur only at very low temperatures or under special
<BR>
conditions such as those pertaining in the EPR situation.  But in
<BR>
the picture advocated here, life has the ability, exemplified by the
<BR>
example of the tightrope walker, to learn under conditions that are
<BR>
not excessively unfavourable to it to neutralise of compensate for
<BR>
the effects of external disturbances.  Such compensation capacity we
<BR>
assume to be functionally effective in respect to the &quot;fragility&quot;
<BR>
referred to by Bohm also.
<BR>
<P>A comment by Bohm et al.(9) regarding the understanding of
<BR>
superconductivity in the causal interpretation provides a clue as to
<BR>
what kind of overall organisation might be relevant for psi
<BR>
functioning.  This situation is described in the following terms:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In the superconducting state of a many-electron system,
<BR>
there is a stable overall organised behaviour, in which the
<BR>
movements are coordinated by the quantum potential so that the
<BR>
individual electrons are not scattered by obstacles.  One can say
<BR>
indeed that in such a state, the quantum potential brings about a
<BR>
coordinated movement which can be thought of as resembling a 'ballet
<BR>
dance'.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The assumption of a superconducting-like state provides an
<BR>
example of a context where different organisms can be highly
<BR>
correlated.  Such a state may be relevant to the origin of life, or
<BR>
to the Gaia hypothesis of Lovelock and Margulis(22).  Perturbations
<BR>
such as an increase in temperature cause the coordinated
<BR>
organisation to break up, and this would provide a mechanism by
<BR>
which the amount of linking of an individual organism to other
<BR>
systems through non-local interconnections could be adjustable.  One
<BR>
may imagine that life may exist from the beginning (cf. Ref. 22) as
<BR>
a cooperative whole directly interconnected at a distance by Bell
<BR>
type non-local interactions, following which modifications through
<BR>
the course of evolution cause organisms to be interconnected
<BR>
directly with each other and with objects to an extent that is
<BR>
adapted to circumstances.  One can see conceptual similarities
<BR>
between psi skills and ordinary skills, e.g. between the perceptual
<BR>
skills of hearing and telepathy on the one hand, and between the
<BR>
forms of control of matter involved in the control of the body and
<BR>
in psychokinesis on the other.  From this point of view, it is only
<BR>
in regard to the mode of interaction that the ordinary phenomena and
<BR>
the analogous paranormal ones differ from each other.  These
<BR>
analogies will be discussed in more detail elsewhere.
<BR>
<P>The theories discussed here have the feature, in contrast to
<BR>
that of quantum mechanics, of being qualitative rather than
<BR>
quantitative.  This may be an unavoidable correlate of such aspects
<BR>
of nature, stemming from a fundamental irreproducibility of biology
<BR>
and of the phenomena connected with the indeterminism of the quantum
<BR>
domain.
<BR>
<P>8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS
<BR>
<P>The goal of this paper has been that of gaining some
<BR>
understanding, within the framework of conventional science, of
<BR>
phenomena such as telepathy and psychokinesis which (particularly in
<BR>
terms of the actual experience(23,24)) seem to involve some form of
<BR>
direct contact at a distance.  While the non-local correlations
<BR>
found in EPR-type systems seem at first sight(20) to provide a
<BR>
scientifically valid basis for such direct contact (particularly for
<BR>
the case of telepathy which has many features that parallel those of
<BR>
EPR-type correlations), calculations using the formal apparatus of
<BR>
quantum theory suggest that any such connections will be purely

random and thus unusable.  But the self-consistent and completely
<BR>
logical multiple-description view of knowledge advocated here, an
<BR>
alternative to the conventional view that all knowledge may be
<BR>
reduced to quantum mechanical knowledge, allows life to have its own
<BR>
potentialities, beyond what the constraints of &quot;good scientific
<BR>
method&quot; will allow, for knowing and for acting on the basis of such
<BR>
knowing.  Included in these categories of acting and knowing are
<BR>
psychic functioning.
<BR>
<P>The present theory parallels in a number of respects the
<BR>
theory of Walker(12) with its postulate that the statistical
<BR>
outcomes of quantum phenomena can be modified by consciousness, and
<BR>
the paper of Stapp(25), in which creative mind has a similar
<BR>
function. These different approaches may all be representations of
<BR>
slightly different aspects of the same underlying truth, gained by
<BR>
taking as a starting point a range of different points of view.
