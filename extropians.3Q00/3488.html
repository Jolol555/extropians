<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
I'm working on a British documentary today for Discovery Channel on &quot;Raw
<BR>
Beauty&quot;, or more recently titled &quot;Science of Beauty.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If anyone has any suggestions for the future of physical beauty, mental
<BR>
aesthetics, or any area of the science of perceptions of beauty and
<BR>
recognition, please send me your comments for inclusion!
<BR>
<P>I'd really appreciate input from the technological and scientific oriented
<BR>
extropians and other transhumanists.
<BR>
<P>I will be focusing on transhumans and posthumans.  Here is some of my topics:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * * * * * * * * *
<BR>
<P>As cogently as possible from general to specific:
<BR>
<P>(A.)	Extropic Art - genre of art that is an aesthetic take on the future.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)	Automorph Art - shaping the self.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a.)	Technologies:  nanotechnology, AI, genetic engineering,
<BR>
human/computer interfaces, virtual reality, virtual selves.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.)	Physical beauty:  outer appearance, emotional appearance. Changing
<BR>
body and brain to extend our lives.
<BR>
<P><P>(A.)  	My thoughts stem around the art concept of Extropic Art which
<BR>
incorporates the aesthetics, the science and the technologies of
<BR>
superlongevity.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My deep interest in pursuing knowledge about life extension sciences and
<BR>
technologies is steered by a practical optimism.  It is essential to
<BR>
continue evolutionary advances by using technology to extend life, augment
<BR>
intelligence, optimize psychology, and improve social systems.  We are
<BR>
changing and we will continue to acquire greater capabilities with which to
<BR>
enjoy our lives and the universe around us.  In doing so, I find it
<BR>
advantageous to challenge conventional thinking about human limits and
<BR>
think about how technologies will improve our future.  The footnote here is
<BR>
that attempting to change conventional thinking requires both sensibility
<BR>
and understanding.  Many people find it difficult to adapt to new ways of
<BR>
thinking, especially when it involves biotechnology.  Rather than alienate
<BR>
those who question the ethics or the direction of science and technology, I
<BR>
try to understand opposing views and deal with information on advanced
<BR>
technologies and their positive potentials, their challenges, and their
<BR>
possible dangers.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the concept is to seek the continuation and acceleration of the
<BR>
evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human form and limits.
<BR>
The integration of technology seems to be a positive way to do this as
<BR>
evidenced by any heart transplant and prosthetic limb.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.)  Automorph  Art is the Extropic Art of consciously and
<BR>
comprehensively sculpting one's physiology and psychology.   The focus of
<BR>
Automorph Art is shaping appearance, the mind, feelings, intellect,
<BR>
identity to make one's whole self an object of beauty, not just physical
<BR>
appearance, although this is part of it. (general philosophy)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a.)	In explaining what this means:  shaping entire identity:  physical
<BR>
appearance, identify, emotions.  This will be enabled by new technologies:
<BR>
nanotechnology, genetic engineering, computer interfaces.  The technologies
<BR>
that will make this a reality.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.)  Physical possibilities:  superlongevity.  The particular is the
<BR>
physical beauty.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stress the uniqueness of using advanced technologies to alter ourselves
<BR>
in ways not possible before.  If we are not psychologically beautiful, we
<BR>
can alter our brain and our genes.  To be ethically beautiful by shaping
<BR>
psychology and behavior through modifying psychology by responding with
<BR>
emotional refinement.  (Rewiring the way the brain works.)  Put in context
<BR>
that beauty is more than skin deep.  I take this very seriously.  Beauty is
<BR>
the whole self and by sculpting the whole self, one can be dimensionally
<BR>
beautiful.  Aesthetic means healthy, vigorous, strong, elegant.
<BR>
<P><P>In summation:  If we can choose what our individual beauty is: we can
<BR>
determine what we want to look like and such is my perspective about beauty
<BR>
and superlongevity.  
<BR>
<P>Further, my future body design Primo 3M+ is an artistic vision of what
<BR>
types of changes could be made to alter our bodies (located at

occur in the future.  This mock up design would put good use to

nanotechnology, genetic engineering, and artificial intelligence with

prosthetic parts and augmentations.
