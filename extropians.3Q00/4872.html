<EM>&gt; we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get more powerful computers at lower cost with more AIish abilities 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and more jobs will fall to them.  We had best be thinking really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right now about how we plan to have people have a decent life 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regular for pay job. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This sort of concern seems to have come up with every major advance in
<BR>
technology.  But historically  there's always been a shift in the sort of
<BR>
work roles available with no net loss of opportunity to work.  
<BR>
<P>The greatest problem I foresee is educating the workforce quickly enough
<BR>
to keep up with changes in work roles available.  I'm troubled by the
<BR>
inflexible way of thinking kids are being taught in USA schools.  Don't
<BR>
know about schools in other parts of the world. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Probably the most valuable education a kid could have today, given the
<BR>
rapidly changing social environment, would be basic reading skills,
<BR>
exposure to basic math concepts,  practice at  learning new skills, and
<BR>
exposure to the basic techniques of finding novel methods of improving 
<BR>
imperfect situations.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This technology is supposed to be about a more abundant life for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beings.  When the technology takes over what the human beings had 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing to support themselves the human beings must still be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supported. 
</EM><BR>
<P>The above statement seems to be based on the premise that most of the
<BR>
paid jobs people currently do are directly related to the production of 
<BR>
the basic necessities.  I don't have exact statistics, but I'm fairly
<BR>
certain that most of the work people are doing today is NOT directly
<BR>
related to fulfilling the basic needs of food and shelter (possibly
<BR>
medical care should be classified as a basic need) . Much of the work is,
<BR>
if you look at it objectively, &quot;busy-work.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Apparently during the first half of the 20th century people believed that
<BR>
labor-saving devices really WOULD result in more leisure time, and they
<BR>
looked forward to a 30 hour (or fewer) work week and housework that could
<BR>
be completed in a couple of hours per week.  Instead, people have ended
<BR>
up working longer hours at jobs; in the area of housework, standards of 
<BR>
&quot;cleanliness&quot; have changed such that a white shirt with one tiny spot of
<BR>
dirt is considered dirty and must be washed; floors with a few specks of
<BR>
dust must be cleaned, and so forth.  
<BR>
<P>I would guess that one of the greatest challenges confronting people in
<BR>
the coming few decades will be changing their attitudes towards the use
<BR>
of time.
