I am very saddened and quite honestly shocked that FM-2030 has left us.  I had hoped over the next few years to actually meet the man in person.  But, at least he was cryonically suspended and so we have strong reason to believe he will be among us again sometime in the future.  
<BR>
<P>Natasha, I realize how much you deeply cared for him and so my heart goes out to you.  Please know my thoughts are with you in this difficult time.  
<BR>
<P>Considering the level of sophistication which probably went into his suspension; those of us living now will probably be reanimated a number of years before he is.  That will give us time to prepare him a place in the new world he will awaken in.
<BR>
<P><P>very best wishes,
