<EM>&gt; &gt; Of course, by expressing the planned behaviour, we're collectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; changing the state of the system, and hence introduce an additional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; uncertainty. The others constitute a major part of the fitness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; function, which has to move when their strategies move. For instance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all the fat dotcom fishes in a tiny pond create a lot of ruckus, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; muddy the waters. Mutually making planning more difficult. Time for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some dynamite fishing ;)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Or to answer it in a different way than I originally did, one makes
<BR>
projections under the assumption that state changes will occur.  Most
<BR>
games (e.g. chess) are played in this way.  The real trick is accurately
<BR>
predicting complicated state changes several manipulations later.  As has
<BR>
been shown in games such as chess, technology can be quite adept at
<BR>
accurately forecasting and manipulating state changes in games, given
<BR>
sufficient information about the system it is observing.  I can choose to
<BR>
attack individual fish or the entire school of fish; the strategy is
<BR>
different in each case, but the principles are the same and only the
<BR>
resolution really varies.  Determining the better strategy depends
<BR>
strictly on my goals.
