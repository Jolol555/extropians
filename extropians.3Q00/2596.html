</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; modified  organisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Sellafield? Nothing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BNFL has paid out millions of pounds in compensation to its workers for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; range of cancers, including leukemia, on a probability of just 20% that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cancers were caused by radiation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;TMI? Not one fatality. Chernobyl? A system purposely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;overloaded with all safety systems turned off, as some sort of stupid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'test' by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;your socialist buddies. The lesson of Chernobyl is that socialists can't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;trusted with nuclear power. The lesson of TMI is that US nuclear plants are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;systems even under the worst failure conditions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If socialists/ 3rd world countries can't be trusted, then they shouldn't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; built! Chernobyl affected quite a few (non-socialist) countries as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ..... there was a ban on consumption even of British lamb directly because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of it for several years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you telling me that there are no stupid jerks/ human incompetents in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; USA (no matter what their politics)?
</EM><BR>
<P>The AEC does not allow the sort of 'tests' that caused Chernobyl, nor
<BR>
did the communists have the sort of computer ability we have to simulate
<BR>
all possible situations. Additionally, their plant construction, a
<BR>
graphite core, gas cooled reactor, is far more dangerous than our light
<BR>
water reactor designs. We don't allow graphite core designs in the west.
<BR>
One of the reasons we were so adamant about the North Koreans giving up
<BR>
their own nuclear program and buying light water reactors from us is
<BR>
because they are just as, if not more, screwed up than the USSR was, and
<BR>
if their plants failed, the fallout would fall on Japan, the US, and
<BR>
Canada.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So the safety of tests *can't* be guaranteed then?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Nothing in life is guaranteed. Get out of your cradle and give up the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safety
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;blankee. Mommy ain't nursing you no more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, am not disagreeing that the world is a dangerous place ..... but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prats I don't even know making it *unnecessarily* more dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The greens that you hate are just taking steps on their own behalf against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what they feel is a direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threat to their survival ... not relying on some governmental nanny safety
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blanket.
</EM><BR>
<P>Could have fooled me. Their idea of a safety blanket, though, is to
<BR>
strangle the other kids in the nursery, like typical closet fascists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, so you question the motives of &quot;greenies&quot; who may have left-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; politics. But for sure the motives of Monsanto and the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agri-businesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pushing this GM thru as fast they can *ARE* motivated solely by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-interest and financial gain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What is your reply to this point?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;How do you know what their interests are? Their stockholders are interested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;making money, surely, or else they would not be investing in those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fail to see why such an obviously obsolete socialist argument needs any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reply,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;at least on this list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obvious point ..... yes, even you seem to accept &quot;stockholders are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in making money.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But only an *obsolete* argument if wrong ... are you claiming that Monsanto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are acting out of altruism??
</EM><BR>
<P>The news speaks for me. Since they just released the rights to vitamin A
<BR>
enriched rice, the greens don't have much of a leg to stand on here, do
<BR>
they?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Which has shown tons of evidence that it is perfectly safe there. Humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;been introducing genetically modified agricultural species into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;for millennia. The only difference between then and now is then we were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rolling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the dice with the genes in our breeding programs, while now we have a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;idea of what we are getting. Its quite clear that GE programs are far safer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the hybridization programs humans have been running for thousands of years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Anyone who knows ANYTHING about agriculture knows that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think one danger of GM strains is it will lead to monoculture ... the new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GM seeds might well replace the variety of (less efficient yielding)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strains, and cut down on biodiversity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Our agricultur is ALREADY a monoculture. What GM technology will
<BR>
actually do is create a multiculture, because if Monsanto has the patent
<BR>
on genome A to enrich rice with vitamin A, then Genex has to figure out
<BR>
another way to accomplish the same thing with a different genome map, so
<BR>
the free market will encourage diversity of varieties between companies
<BR>
that produce them, so the concerns of 'monoculture' are not valid.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;What is your answer to the question, though??? What is permaculture?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="http://csf.colorado.edu/perma/">http://csf.colorado.edu/perma/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Permaculture values and validates traditional knowledge and experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Permaculture incorporates sustainable agriculture practices and land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; management techniques and strategies from around the world. Permaculture is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bridge between traditional cultures and emergent earth-tuned cultures.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which is semantically meaningless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Permaculture promotes organic agriculture which does not use pesticides to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pollute the environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since many plants produce their own pesticides (broccoli, etc..) I fear
<BR>
that this irrational obsession about pesticide will result in plant
<BR>
species being made extinct because they produce their own pesticides
<BR>
naturally. Not a very tolerant point of view. Did you know that broccoli
<BR>
causes cancer?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Permaculture aims to maximize symbiotic and synergistic relationships
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between site components.
</EM><BR>
<P>So they beleive in crop rotation, just like any farmer does (even
<BR>
corporate farmers). They just try to say it in that blathering
<BR>
feel-good-speak I would actually expect to hear from a corporate
<BR>
manager, or a Dilbert cartoon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Permaculture is urban planning as well as rural land design.
</EM><BR>
<P>Zoning and landscaping, big freaking whooopeee doooo....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Permaculture design is site specific, client specific, and culture specific.
</EM><BR>
<P>In other words, politically correct floral fascism
