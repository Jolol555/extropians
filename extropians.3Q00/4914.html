<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But:  Just as we should go to space in part to avoid putting all our
</EM><BR>
eggs
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in one basket, I think we should also have some solutions that
</EM><BR>
fail-safe.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of us sentients should live in habitats that are not dependent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; advanced technology.  That come with a biosphere that is capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; sustaining organic, sentient life without use of technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How on earth (or off) would you do that?  There is no place on earth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is not vulnerable to natural or manmade catastrophe.  We don't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vingean bobble fields after all.  And there is no place off of earth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that supports a human compatible biosphere without the use of LOTS of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology.  So I am having trouble understanding what was meant.
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess David Lubkin with have to answer that one.  My guess, though, is
<BR>
that he would say that we already have sentient life living on one planet
<BR>
and small scale disasters have no wiped it out.  Some of these small scale
<BR>
disasters would have destroyed a space colony.  (Of course, my counter
<BR>
argument would be: only one?  I mean if we have hundreds of small colonies,
<BR>
a collision or a solar flare might hurt one or a few, but not all.)
<BR>
<P>Also, on the technology front, sentient life has lived on Earth for a long
<BR>
time without any technology about fire and rocks.  I'm speaking of most of
<BR>
human existence here.  Wherever experts put the dividing line between human
<BR>
and non-human -- 100K years or 3M years -- it's only recently -- the past
<BR>
10K years or less -- that humans have used and needed large amounts of
<BR>
technology to survive.  Granted, at any time, humans could've been and
<BR>
almost were wiped out by several different types of natural disasters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You got me there!  This is true.  I just wonder about the cost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Terraforming Mars without nanotech will take a long, long time and lots
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; resources.  Terraforming it with nanotech seems pointless, because if
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can do that, then you probably don't need to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It will take a lot of tech to maintain an human supportive atmosphere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and temperature on Mars even with nanotech.  And what is this hangup on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human (as we now know them) life support anyway?  I would rather be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to morph my body or better still design one I could &quot;step into&quot; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best suits the environment and needs at hand.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have no such hangup.  My point, however, is that if you have that level of
<BR>
technology, living on Mars is trivial because you can either change yourself
<BR>
or your environment to a much greater extent.  (Granted, you might not be
<BR>
able to live in the Sun's core, but just about every else in the solar
<BR>
system will then be habitable.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; The price of one terraformed world is high compared with many space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stations, space cities, hollowed out asteroids, and all manner of small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; scale space colonies.  Space is a pretty big and cheap basket.  Mars is
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; small and expensive one that requires one to cook many of the eggs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; beforehand.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, we can seed Mars with various low-level organics over decades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that will produce most of the intended transformation.  That is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; costly at all compared to building a space station, much less a space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; city.  A human mission to Mars will run at least 50 billion for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first dropping down to perhaps 20 billion by the third or so according
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the most optimistic well-engineered plans I've seen.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it will take less if done privately and competitively, but I've no
<BR>
interest in colonizing planets or going to Mars.
<BR>
<P>And even with seeding Mars to terraform it, it still costs lots of money to
<BR>
get there.  One will not only have to get stuff there to do the
<BR>
transformation, but also monitoring equipment there to make sure the process
<BR>
is moving along correctly.  Probably not as expensive as moving humans
<BR>
there, but by no means costless.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It will be even more expensive to set up human infrastructure in Near
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Earth space.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only reason I can see for the current slow pace and high cost is
<BR>
government inefficiency at doing such things.  The External Tank idea of
<BR>
building space stations could've put several small scale, cheap stations in
<BR>
orbit by now.  (Not small compared to the ISS.  In fact, an external tank
<BR>
alone has an order of magnitude more volume than the projected size of the
<BR>
ISS.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But subsequent Mars flights and other works will be much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheaper subsequently.  The cost can be defrayed by using robotics as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much as possible to start processing the most accessible space resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have, the near earth asteroids.  The NEAs contain several orders of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; magnitude more wealth than is needed to exploit space and most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propulsion products, building materials and shielding and even rare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; earths needed.  But we need enough presence to start the process of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extracting this wealth economically.  That is the big initial monetary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; priming of the pump.  But we shouldn't set up human habitats as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first major goals.  Humans are relatively difficult and expensive to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support in orbit and need to be returned to earth periodically (in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginning at least).  Robots can stay in space and even assemble (a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stage or two out) more robots in space.  Only when space operations are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already in the black can building large human habitats be justified.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Small habitats for highly skilled personnel needed to get the operation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started and rolling are justifiable earlier.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't disagree.  See my essay on space colonization at my site.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Personally I would consider turning gleisner at the first opportunity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with high capacity core uploads soon following (preceding if possible).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I like human bodies but they are a terrible thing to die in or to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuck exclusively in.
</EM><BR>
<P>The technology still needs to be developed.  It's nice to pretend, but it
<BR>
ain't here yet.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
