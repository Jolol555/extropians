Eugene Leitl writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only realistic way how to get at that initial set of data is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either growing it with an evolutionary algorithm (here the exact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of the computational engine is less crucial) or scanning a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; critter. In latter case you'll have to write a very very precise yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high-performance neuronal emulation engine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly right, and as a consequence, no one is going to write that neuronal
<BR>
emulation engine when the alternative (growing an initial set of data with
<BR>
evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming) obviously surpasses manually
<BR>
coding an AI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure why many apparently smart people still want to do it the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cyc way. Codify everything explicitly, using an army of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmers, until the thing can limp off on its own. I just don't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it work, because even groups of people are just not smart enough for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.
</EM><BR>
<P>Precisely so... What the Cyc way ends up with is a vast (but manageable) data
<BR>
base that does what its namesake implies: It renders encyclopedic knowledge.
<BR>
Like the human caricature of a &quot;walking encyclopedia&quot; it is full of facts and
<BR>
information, but it can't do any real or original thinking. If Cyc passes the
<BR>
Turing test, it does so as a result of the incompetence of human interviewers,
<BR>
not because of Cyc's artificial thought processes. IOW, just because Cyc has all
<BR>
the answers, that doesn't mean it can formulate an intelligent question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your average is not my average. Apart from the bootstrap problem,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which can take arbitrarily long, no one has still validated whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mechanosynthetic reaction repertoire executed by a nanorobot is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficient for a full closure.
</EM><BR>
<P>What do you mean by a full closure?
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The world will witness future discoveries even more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;startling than that of nuclear fission. The question is:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will we be the ones to make them?&quot;
<BR>
