<EM>&gt; I suppose if you start from the ground up fresh this would be an appropriate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement. However I predict that the first SI will be largely structured on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many processes inherent in the human mind, since it is an example that we do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know of that works...and programmers hate to have to do something from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ground up when existing code is already present....
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I use a lot of stuff that I got from looking at the human mind.  I don't
<BR>
use it blindly.  The observer-biased stuff isn't exactly subtle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am of course assuming that any SI would have a characteristic curiosity, like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any being of higher intelligence (basing this on more than just humans, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dolphins, apes, etc).
</EM><BR>
<P>You just cited a bunch of evolved organisms.  Non sequitur.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You are erroneously assuming that an SI would be allowed to develop hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capabilities in the physical world consistent with its capabilities in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtual.
</EM><BR>
<P>An SI *has* capabilities in the physical world, as long as even one binary bit
<BR>
of information is allowed to escape the computer.  This includes a single line
<BR>
of text on a computer monitor in a locked and guarded research laboratory. 
<BR>
You don't have to give the SI full access to Zyvex for it to get loose.  Do
<BR>
you think that because there are none of the objects that humans call &quot;tools&quot;
<BR>
that the SI has no capabilities?  To any sufficiently advanced intelligence,
<BR>
the external Universe is a manipulable continuum.  The parts of that continuum
<BR>
called &quot;humans&quot; are not distinct from the rest of it.  Do you think that
<BR>
because you have placed a lot of objects you call &quot;locks&quot; and &quot;guards&quot; near
<BR>
the SI that it is locked and guarded?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eli, one does not hand a three year old the controls to nuclear bombs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mikey, we don't have a choice.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; One does not perform &quot;research&quot; in this area.  One gets it right the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; time.  One designs an AI that, because it is one's friend, can be trusted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recover from any mistakes made by the programmers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What about programming the SI does to itself?
</EM><BR>
<P>If it's smart enough, then it won't make mistakes.  If it's not smart enough,
<BR>
then it should be able to appreciate this fact, and help us add safeguards to
<BR>
prevent itself from making mistakes that would interfere with its own goals.
