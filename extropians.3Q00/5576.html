Emlyn, breaking himself away from all that sports action

on the telly, wrote:

<P><EM>&gt; Working on GM food is good. Great! Designing crops to feed more people,

<EM>&gt; excellent. Designing crops with terminator genes, dodgy, but still ok, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe. Releasing self replicators into the general environment without 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safeguards, not so good. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I just knew if I waited long enough people would come round
<BR>
to my point of view.  I believe scientists feel currently that
<BR>
the largest amount of biomass on the planet *is* self-replicators
<BR>
*in* the general environment, *without* safeguards.
<BR>
<P>Quoting the Nobel Prize winner, Joshua Ledeberg
<BR>
(Science 288(5464):291 (14 Apr 2000)):
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5464/291">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5464/291</A>

<P>&quot;The Microbial World Wide Web&quot;:
<BR>
: &quot;Mutators (genes that enhance variability) abound and may be
<BR>
:  switched on and off by different environmental factors. The germs'
<BR>
:  ability to transfer their own genetic scripts, via processes such
<BR>
:  as plasmid transfer, means they can exchange biological innovations
<BR>
:  including resistance to antibiotics.&quot;
<BR>
<P>: &quot;Many viruses can integrate (download) their own DNA into host genomes,
<BR>
:  which subsequently can be copied and passed on: Hundreds of segments
<BR>
:  of human DNA originated from historical encounters with retroviruses whose
<BR>
:  genetic information became integrated into our own genomes.&quot;
<BR>
<P>: &quot;What makes microbial evolution particularly intriguing, and worrisome,
<BR>
:  is a combination of vast populations and intense fluctuations in those
<BR>
:  populations. It's a formula for top-speed evolution. ... A year in the
<BR>
:  life of bacteria would easily match the span of mammalian evolution!&quot;
<BR>
<P>I would add to that note, that my news trailer this morning informs
<BR>
me of that a 12th case of West Nile Fever has been discovered.
<BR>
Then of course we should not forget ~40 million people infected by HIV
<BR>
that more recent studies seem to be confirming originated from natural
<BR>
sources and wasn't transfered into human populations by the polio
<BR>
vaccine.  Add to that, several hundred million infected with Malaria,
<BR>
causing ~4,000 deaths *each* day.  That number is exceeded by TB
<BR>
which killed ~3 million people in 1995.  A number that is likely to
<BR>
increase as drug resistant strains spread.  All that caused by
<BR>
4 species of microorganisms out of the millions that are believed
<BR>
to exist.
<BR>
<P>So, Emlyn, for this to be an ultimately safe transhuman world, we
<BR>
clearly need to fix this problem.  I doubt using all of our nukes
<BR>
to sterilize the planets surface would accomplish this the problem
<BR>
because of the really deep rock protected microorganisms that would
<BR>
still harbor retroviruses.  Its probably going to require dumping
<BR>
a number of 50-100 km asteroids onto the surface to boil the oceans
<BR>
and heat the continental crust up to 300-400 deg. for a week or so.
<BR>
Then we can rebuild life from the ground up using entirely engineered
<BR>
as safe (Transhuman Laboratories Approved) organisms that don't shuffle 
<BR>
their information code, transfer it hither, thither and yon and don't
<BR>
replicate unless they say &quot;May I?&quot;.
<BR>
<P>It would make a good debate for the next Extro conference:
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;Reconstructing Nature: Pros, Cons and Preferred Methods&quot;
<BR>
<P>Thanks for coming over to my side... It warms my heart.
<BR>
