<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,37610,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,37610,00.html</A> describes some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of Greg Benford's visions of future software, a marketing war between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems that try to build dossiers about consumers that are used for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;customized sales pitches, and interface software which will attempt to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;protect consumers' privacy.  Benford also predicts the advent of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;comfy culture&quot;, a futuristic world where everything is customized to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;match the preferences of users.  In his vision, the natural world will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem boring and unresponsive compared to cities, where everything will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be alive and alluring.  However there may be an increasing movement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to extreme and dangerous sports in order to escape from the coddling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of civilization.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sounds like it was quite a talk.  I wonder if Benford has any essays
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elaborating on these points in more detail?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
There was a short story that Benford did for a local publication - OC Metro 
<BR>
or OC Weekly, I forget which - five years or so ago, in which he envisioned 
<BR>
a day in the life of a couple of mid-21st Century OC (Orange County, CA) 
<BR>
yuppies who make their living as I recall as 
<BR>
marketing/procurement/investment specialists in CyberSpace.  The CyberSpace 
<BR>
he envisioned was a kind of Gibson takeoff, but with full immersive VR, 
<BR>
bodysuits, etc.
<BR>
<P>The really important point of the story, however, was the economics.  The 
<BR>
main character, the woman of the man/wife team, was acquiring her critical 
<BR>
market information via trading on &quot;credibiity,&quot; not as an abstract normative 
<BR>
judgement, but as a quantifiable web currency.  The only other mention I've 
<BR>
seen of this major conceptual breakthru is in Sterling's novel 
<BR>
&quot;Abstraction.&quot;
<BR>
<P>There are, however, ways to do this.  I briefly discussed a system for 
<BR>
instituting the basis of a credibility-based net economy with Esther Dyson 
<BR>
in the early '90's, as a money-making product.  I also attempted to bring 
<BR>
this up at Extropy meetings in that period, but I think that the NIH 
<BR>
syndrome got in the way.
