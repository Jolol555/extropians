<P><P><EM>&gt; Sinfo and Dinfo?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yeah... what, you've never heard of Sinfo and Dinfo?  You really should
<BR>
catch their show sometime, they're freakin' hilarious.  Especially that
<BR>
little Dinfo... always bumping into stuff... hehehe.... Dinfo....
<BR>
<P><P>I -know- all the major complaints are going to come from the technical
<BR>
angle.  As stated, I really wanted to just engage in the mind experiment: IF
<BR>
it were possible, would it result in a desirable state of affairs?
<BR>
<P>But I'll hypothesize nonetheless:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ok, I gotta ask: if I &quot;buy&quot; a piece of music online, dowload it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and play it on my computer; and, if it is &quot;protected&quot; so that i
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can not make extensive copies of it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  What's to keep me from playing it (I'm still allowed to listen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to it, right?), recording it on a cassette recorder, re-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; converting that to a digital format, and distributing thousands
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of copies free?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, well this is the issue-- you can't encrypt the last link in the chain.
<BR>
Maybe music will always be 'Dinfo.'
<BR>
<P>Or maybe not.
<BR>
<P>I'm trying to consider the concept of a fundmentally different type of
<BR>
information-- this is wildly speculative stuff here, so lets just think
<BR>
outside the box for a minute:
<BR>
<P>The sort of information I'm talking about is likely to be extremely complex
<BR>
and represent full blown human experiences and the like, but let's just deal
<BR>
with a primitive little sensory experience like music or the movies.
<BR>
Firstly, the future means of distribution of these experiences may not be
<BR>
over 'material' substrates like the air of your living room.  But secondly,
<BR>
with only a little sprinkle of imagination, isn't it possible to envision a
<BR>
type of experiential information that is protected against analog capture?
<BR>
My digital video camera, for instance, doesn't like capturing footage off of
<BR>
a television screen or computer monitor-- the refresh rates don't match.  If
<BR>
we start with a different set of assumptions and different starting
<BR>
conditions I think we can imagine a scenario in which your music capturing
<BR>
equipment knows whether or not its allowed to duplicate my music data.
<BR>
Think of the empowerment of privacy in a world in which I can send you an
<BR>
audio message that can't be surreptitiously recorded.  Hell, maybe we'll
<BR>
have such fine grained control over -reality- that I'll be able to play a
<BR>
message in a crowded room and only you will hear it.
<BR>
<P>Okay, so, it's pure speculation.  I'll grant that.  I'm talking about
<BR>
imaginary technology here folks.
<BR>
<P>So, I don't need to hear about how it can't be done-- but I would be
<BR>
interested to hear some intelligent discussion on whether such a thing would
<BR>
ever be possible.
<BR>
<P><P>Cheers.
