<EM>&gt;From: Brent Allsop &lt;<A HREF="mailto:allsop@fc.hp.com?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;F80wY0VnkB4ltFlmmlQ000056ce@hotmail.com&gt;">allsop@fc.hp.com</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt;	Also, communism is forced cooperation, which I don't believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is good at all.  I believe the more we progress the more volunteer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;charity work is done.  This is true even if we are spending less of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;percentage of our total output on charity and philanthropy, the total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work is still growing exponential along with everything else.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must admit that even in free market countries, there is ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;increasing amount of charity work going on.  Such provides a kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minimum standard to all beings which is ever growing and improving.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Hopefully this safety net will soon cross an important threshold and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be able to guarantee at least survival for all sentient beings.  Heck,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think even the Amish will be guaranteed their ability to remain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human, live short suffering lives without technology, and so on and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so forth for as long as they choose such, thanks to the supper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advanced and intelligent beings very small charitable contributions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which will make living lake that much easier than it is today?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	At the top end, though, let the competition continue, and may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the best be that which is eventually adopted and chosen by all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rest.  This isn't communism is it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, yes and no.  Ideally communism is a system in which all goods are 
<BR>
equally shared by the people.  That sounds pretty close to the system you 
<BR>
are describing to me.  Keep in mind that the social systems in China and the 
<BR>
former USSR are severely corrupted iterations of communism at best.  
<BR>
Communism doesn’t inherently require an iron curtain through which no 
<BR>
communist citizen can pass, or militaristic, repressive totalitarian 
<BR>
regimes.  All you need for “pure” communism is a system by which each member 
<BR>
produces according to ver ability and consumes according to ver need.  Isn’t 
<BR>
that what you are describing?
