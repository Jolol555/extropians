<EM>&gt; &gt;  No, I don't; rational thinking is not inspiration, and can never
</EM><BR>
substitute
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  for it. Well, maybe a more intelligent being can use rationality to do
</EM><BR>
what
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  a less intelligent being would have to use inspiration/intuition for,
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the more intelligent being can still use inspiration to reach even
</EM><BR>
further.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  But this is still in the context of, and entirely bounded by, rational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  thought. You can use inspiration to decide what to prove/test, but
</EM><BR>
rational
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  thought must do the proof/testing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ...this is a very keen paragraph.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Forms of thought. The exploration of the effect of thoughts (of god or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise) is a far more productive exploration that the exploration of
</EM><BR>
proof
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for (or against) god.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The thought forms we create  -- literally shape our existance. Like a blue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; print, inspiration or rational, we make our thoughts into buildings,
</EM><BR>
churches
<BR>
<EM>&gt; or garages, into skyways, teleportation devices or microwaves....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In that way, and in that way only, god does exist. Not because there
</EM><BR>
really
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is anything out there &quot;shaping&quot; things, but because for so damn long, our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existance has been infinitely shaped by the thought(s) that he/it does.
</EM><BR>
And
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the following mayhem or order depending on your world view.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Things would be very very different if the &quot;god modules&quot; weren't installed
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; us. Unimagineable to say how.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No one can say that a thought is reality,  yet to deny it's existance is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lunacy. There lies the conundrum.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I guess that talking about God at this level is a matter of aesthetics. I
<BR>
find it faintly distasteful to refer to my inspiration as coming from God;
<BR>
like eating burnt soup.
<BR>
<P>I don't think there's any supernatural element to the inspiration/creative
<BR>
bits of the thought processes. Just nonlinear wet stuff, slapping together
<BR>
weird, disconnected ideas in weird, difficult to fathom ways, such that you
<BR>
can't explain the derivation to any useful degree. When your brain comes up
<BR>
with something out of left field, the only derivation for which would be
<BR>
some kind of neural trace showing neuron firings in painful detail, from
<BR>
some distant past up to now, well, just forget the explanation. Just think,
<BR>
instead, &quot;aha!&quot;. A bolt from the blue; it's really a bolt from the grey.
<BR>
<P>But I can't prove that. I can't say for sure that every part of the
<BR>
inspirational process comes from less than a bucket full of sloppy brain
<BR>
stuff. It's Ockham's razor, which boils down to purely subjective aesthetic
<BR>
sense. One person's god is another person's epilepsy.
