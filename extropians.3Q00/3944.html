<P><EM>&gt;Only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at a very fundamental, arational level--seek social status, maximize 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pleasure/pain ratios, reproduce, and so forth--do values not rely on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beliefs about facts.  And at that level, almost everyone agrees.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  I think our values are profoundly shaped by the
<BR>
&quot;values&quot; of the genetic and memetic replicators which produce so
<BR>
much of us.  Those &quot;values&quot; are, of course, to replicate, and so
<BR>
each replicator has a different value (replicating itself).  Hence,
<BR>
at that level, we don't agree, because my memes and genes aren't 
<BR>
the same set as yours.
<BR>
<P>Taking a memetic view, the distinction between facts and values
<BR>
becomes less clear.  Humans have beliefs, and hold them for varied
<BR>
reasons.  When the reason is that the belief has undergone scientific
<BR>
tests, we call it a &quot;fact&quot;; otherwise we call it a &quot;value&quot;.  However,
<BR>
a &quot;fact&quot; must also have some memetic replication or nobody will
<BR>
bother to remember it - there's lots of ultra-trivia nobody cares
<BR>
about.  How many cornflakes were in your cereal last week?
<BR>
Who cares?  Nonetheless, no matter how
<BR>
much something is a &quot;fact&quot;, it must also be somewhat a &quot;value&quot; to
<BR>
play a part in society. Unfortunately, the reverse doesn't hold.
