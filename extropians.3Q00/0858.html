<EM>&gt; I'm afraid you'll have to spell it out for me, I'm suffering from a pathetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lack of imagination. If my entire audience has the idea that they need never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (and should never) pay to listen, and reality maps onto this by way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pirated material which is incredibly easy to access (easier than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paid-for stuff), then how do I get paid?
</EM><BR>
<P>One proposal turns art from a product into a service.  That is, you pay
<BR>
the artist for his time, not for each copy of the output.  An artist
<BR>
would agree to release a new artwork only when enough people had pledged
<BR>
to pay for it.  Once it was released, it would be freely available.
<BR>
He might release a partial or low-quality version ahead of time to show
<BR>
people what the final product would be like.
<BR>
<P>Now there are obvious problems with this, and I will mention one or two.
<BR>
However, the important thing to keep in mind is, this is not intended to
<BR>
maintain the status quo.  It may turn out that not as many artists (or
<BR>
programmers) get paid as much as they get paid today.  We don't know the
<BR>
shape of the future, but obviously things will be different, and this may
<BR>
be an area where things change.  If it seems that this system will cause
<BR>
less art to be produced, we know that supply and demand will drive the
<BR>
price of the artist's labor upward.  The net result is hard to predict.
<BR>
<P>The first objection is the &quot;free rider&quot; problem.  Why should anyone
<BR>
pledge if they know they can get the work for free once others have
<BR>
pledged enough?  The reason is because if everyone thinks this way, they
<BR>
won't get any art.  So sooner or later people will break down and pledge.
<BR>
People pay money now for PBS and other services they could get for free,
<BR>
for exactly this reason.
<BR>
<P>The second objection is how new artists get started.  Why should anyone
<BR>
pay for the work of an untried artist?  New artists would have to release
<BR>
their works for free, initially.  Novelists could publish the first half
<BR>
of their novel freely, then demand payment to finish it.  Musicians could
<BR>
release some songs, then demand payment to make more.  This is really
<BR>
not all that different from the current system.  Artists seldom make
<BR>
much money right off the bat.  They need to build up a reputation first.
<BR>
<P>Another problem is whether people could get advance payment on unpublished
<BR>
works, as established artists can do today from their publishers.  I would
<BR>
think the same system could work in the future, with a middleman acquiring
<BR>
the legal rights to the payment for the released work in exchange for
<BR>
granting an advance fee.  Another way to look at it is as an unsecured
<BR>
loan, based on the reputation of the artist.  The economics of such
<BR>
advances wouldn't be all that different from today.
<BR>
<P>Horror author Stephen King has been proposing an experiment along these
<BR>
lines, where he would offer a novel online if he got enough people to pay.
<BR>
Then they would be free to share the novel with others.
