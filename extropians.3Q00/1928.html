<EM>&gt; &gt;I looked, but am disappointed in Eidolon. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I could buy a big fat physical book for $11 plus postage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I passed on this customer reaction to Steve at Fictionwise, who made the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following response, which he's allowed me to repost here: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ============= 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, there are people like that. But there are plenty others who don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feel this way. The price we've posted is a bit less than the australian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; newsstand price, so I don't understand the price issue. The purpose of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ebooks is definitely not to offer books at a &quot;fraction of the cost.&quot; This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is really a fallacy. An ebook should be priced a little lower than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; print edition, but not at &quot;a fraction&quot; of the cost. (Unless the fraction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you are talking about is 9/10.)  The printing costs for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a physical paper back book are only about $1 out of a list price here in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the usa of about $8. So by any reasonable logic the price should be about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10 percent less for an ebook with the same content. What people are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paying for is the *content* not much the package.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah Phooey. What we are paying for with real books is the book makers,
<BR>
distributors and sellers cost to print, store, process, ship, inventory,
<BR>
process, ship, inventory on retail shelves (at retail real estate costs), and
<BR>
for the incremental cost of that nice bookstore infrastructure and the people
<BR>
who work in it (oh yeah, and the three or more tiers of profit as well, which we
<BR>
shouldn't have to pay for with ebooks either).
<BR>
<P>What Eidolon and Fictionwise are doing is making you pay for the cost of their
<BR>
exhorbitant dot com advertising budgets, and the amortized cost of developing
<BR>
their server system software (if its custom). The majority of the cost of a
<BR>
successful or semi-successful dot com is advertising: getting your brand
<BR>
recognised on TV, Print, radio, and web media. Web portals make you pay an
<BR>
exhorbitant amount of money to have an agressive presence on their sites, where
<BR>
every keyword you want to control (i.e. when people use that keyword in the
<BR>
search engine, your ad pops up on the response page) costs between $600-2000 per
<BR>
month (where they estimate your keyword will get between 15,000-35,000 'hits' in
<BR>
that month usually, and they never guarrantee any kind of 'click thru'
<BR>
percentage, because its usually less than 0.1%)
<BR>
<P>Its not you Damien. You are as much a pawn in this as the rest of us. What this
<BR>
is is the new economics of the 'free content' marketplace externalizing its
<BR>
costs onto the 'not free' content, along with the Advertising/PR industry making
<BR>
us pay for their repeated attempts to program our consumer choices from the old
<BR>
market to the new. If it were so great, then it should stand on its own merits
<BR>
and not require so much hype.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have over 2,100 readers at Fictionwise right now, and that is growing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by about 1,000 per month. Most of these people read on Palm Pilot and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rocket Ebook platforms and are quite happy to pay what we're asking. And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have ample repeat sales to prove that this is not just a fluke. Currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nearly 25% of all our sales are repeat customers. We have several customers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who have come back 4 or more times (and we've only been open about six weeks).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We have several customers who have bought more than 60 titles and have spent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; close to $100.
</EM><BR>
<P>So they've been in business for two months? Sounds like a LOT of market
<BR>
experience this guy has to go on.. ;)
<BR>
<P>I'd LOVE to hear what he would say in response to my comments, but I would not
<BR>
want to put you out into irritating him too much...
