ELF Targets GE Research at Johns Hopkins Research Hospital
<BR>
<P>Johns Hopkins Research Hospital, Baltimore, MD - On Sunday July 23, the Earth 
<BR>
Liberation Front (ELF) claimed responsibility for anti-biotech direct actions 
<BR>
at the Johns Hopkins Research Hospital (JHRH) in Baltimore, Maryland, the 
<BR>
first known incident of such action against a research hospital.  Under cover 
<BR>
of night and through use of all-natural wooden clubs, the activists 
<BR>
overwhelmed security and destoyed two wards of genetically engineered 
<BR>
children.  They also monkeywrenched several research monkeys.
<BR>
<P>JHRH has won notoriety as an institution that has pioneered the science of 
<BR>
genetic engineering.  Its labs are responsible for research related to the 
<BR>
&quot;discovery of genetic therapy techniques that show great promise in curing a 
<BR>
variety of formerly untreatable, and often terminal, childhood diseases.&quot;  
<BR>
The ELF is an international organization that uses direct action to stop the 
<BR>
systematic exploitation and destruction of naturally occurring genes.  ELF 
<BR>
activists have  flagged JHRH as a key component in &quot;the genetic-medical 
<BR>
industry&quot;, where the natural evolution of humans is dissected and manipulated 
<BR>
to fit the market demand generated by desperate parents.
<BR>
<P>Regardless of the non-profit nature of JHRH, the research conducted there in 
<BR>
the name of modern progress only serves to deepen the biodiversity crisis by 
<BR>
replacing the rare genes of ill children with those of homogeneously healthly 
<BR>
humans. The quest for funding and thirst for more knowledge that drives the 
<BR>
genetic-medical industry toward a redesigning of life, rather than 
<BR>
researching solutions based on respect for natural processes, are arrogant 
<BR>
and dangerous.  ELF has thus decided to end such research by violent means.
<BR>
<P>A communiqué sent by the E.L.F. stated, &quot;Over 30 research children and 5 
<BR>
research monkeys were cut down trampled.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The communiqué continued,  &quot;At JHRH, researchers were modifying DNA to 
<BR>
prevent a variety of painful and ultimately fatal childhood diseases.  The 
<BR>
work of these capitalist doctors threatened to create a whole generation of 
<BR>
disease-resistant children able to live productive and happy lives.  Some of 
<BR>
the children might have themselves become scientists and doctors, thus 
<BR>
continuing the cycle of anti-environmental activitiy.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The ELF added, &quot;Searching for super-technological solutions to problems 
<BR>
caused by human reproduction does a great disservice to the future of our 
<BR>
planet by ignoring the reciprocal and highly probable effects of tampering 
<BR>
with basic life processes. Direct actionists such as ELF have demonstrated 
<BR>
that they believe in going beyond the legally sanctioned forms of protest, to 
<BR>
draw attention to the grave dangers of GE and to ensure that children suffer 
<BR>
and die as nature intended.&quot;
