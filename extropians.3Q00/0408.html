I wish people would give a little more content than a URL, as it

makes it easier to talk about:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOSCOW, July 5 -  His fashion sense isn't as elegant as Gucci's, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roman Kunikov says his gasoline-powered boots are a step forward in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;footwear - as much as 13 feet per stride.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KUNIKOV IS ONE of the professors at a Russian engineering institute
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who designed the boots that were tested Tuesday in a public square in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ufa, 750 miles southeast of Moscow.  The test showed that wearers can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achieve speeds of up to 25 mph, Kunikov said in a telephone interview.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boots incorporate one-foot pistons that strap along the calf and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire downward after the wearer steps down, pushing a metal plate away
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the bottom of the shoe - and the wearer up into the air.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoe works in a rhythm with the wearer's step. As he steps down,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his body weight resets the piston, which then fires and pushes him
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on his way. The plate is connected to the sole of the shoe by metal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rods that work as shock absorbers. The shoes use ordinary gasoline,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunikov said.
<BR>
<P>These sound like fun, if they could be mass produced.  It would be
<BR>
great to be able to run along at 20+ mph with these pistons hurtling you
<BR>
forward with each stride.  Imagine entering the local road race wearing
<BR>
these things and running rings around the winners (of course your results
<BR>
would not count).
<BR>
<P>Probably would never happen though, too hard to make them safe.
<BR>
<P>Reading this reminded me of an old product from the 70s, the gasoline
<BR>
powered pogo stick.  Kind of a similar idea, each time you came down the
<BR>
piston fires and shoots you back up.  Always sounded like a bumpy ride
<BR>
though.
<BR>
