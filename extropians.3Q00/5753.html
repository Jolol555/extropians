<P><EM>&gt; I do get this.  And yet it still seems that even if we can't convince
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them its coming or get them to really understand what that means (though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who knows?) if they are convinced, that we owe it to them to do our best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make sure they aren't run over and that they are actually benefitted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (as a minimum).
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;we owe it to them&quot;? And what do they owe us? What have they done (lately) to
<BR>
promote and extend the cognitive sciences? What have they done to advance and
<BR>
enlarge the store of human knowledge? Never mind... Forget them... let's ask
<BR>
ourselves what *we've* done to bring the world closer to TS.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, the extremes are both unlikely.  I would suspect it is somewhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in between, it will make its own mistakes.  But I find it very unlikely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the masses will not be manipulated against those &quot;selfish,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; egotistical scientists&quot; who let this thing loose in their midst.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who will do the manipulating? ...and how will they manage to manipulate &quot;the
<BR>
masses&quot; more effectively than the AI can do so?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure.  But what of the humans who will be even more largely out of work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and feel/be even more redundant?  How will you organize society so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these folks get taken care of so that they don't see this as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tremendous threat and possibly the end of their own means of survival?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's called capitalism. Buggy whip makers had to adjust to the invention of the
<BR>
automobile, and tomorrow's workers (especially knowledge workers) will need to
<BR>
adjust to the invention of AI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If that is and continues to be *all* that makes the world go 'round then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we all end up on the trash-heap of history in the very short run.  A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great motivation to do the R&amp;D isn't it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not the way I see it. Since money is what makes the world go 'round, best get to
<BR>
making plenty of it. The very best motivation to do the R&amp;D that will enable you
<BR>
to make the most of it. (Max More seems to have grok'd this long ago.)
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>&quot;The history of woman is the history of the worst form of tyranny the
<BR>
world has every known; the tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is
<BR>
the only tyranny that lasts.&quot;
