<EM>&gt;  I don't think this is entirely true:  There have been &quot;official&quot; 
</EM><BR>
definitions 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of art, high and low, in many other periods, from the influence of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  National Academies in France and the UK in the 18th-19th centuries back to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the impact of royal or ecclesiastical patronage in earlier times.  Those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  institutions sought to create a bright line between art/not-art.  
</EM><BR>
<P>True Greg, true. And those standards were severely challenged when the camera 
<BR>
was invented. Even the camera obscura (15th century) made realism less of an 
<BR>
art and more of a science. 
<BR>
<P>My point is: Technology lead us out of classical art, which went in search of 
<BR>
the perfection in 2 dimensional representational imagery. When the color 
<BR>
camera was able to take far better images of &quot;reality&quot; with just the click of 
<BR>
a button, mere copying became boring. People's attention turned back to 
<BR>
composition, form.. and abstract expression. 
<BR>
<P>Technology today will also lead us out of our current narrow views of art. 
<BR>
It's best to observe, learn..or more exciting - to explore. &quot;What is&quot; (was?) 
<BR>
art (when the rapid changes in mediums present a landscape in wild upheaval) 
<BR>
has been left behind in the 20th century, or discussed in the far far future.
