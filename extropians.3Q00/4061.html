<P><P><EM>&gt;Hah, I can top that- back in 1980, I was employee #2 at Otrona (Ron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Lingemann &amp; I working in his basement workshop), and I wirewrapped the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prototype of the Attache portable computer.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(Otrona went belly up in 1984. Ancient history...)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Doug, you should feel proud. My former boss at JPL *loved* his
<BR>
Otrona computer. He was Principal Investigator for the Voyager 2
<BR>
spacecraft photopolarimeter instrument, and he travelled with that
<BR>
computer everywhere: to NASA meetings and workshops, conferences,
<BR>
etc. It was the first time I'd seen a &quot;portable&quot; computer, and how
<BR>
useful it could be for a scientist. I finshed my B.S. degree and
<BR>
left JPL in 1984, so I don't know how much longer he kept that old
<BR>
computer.
<BR>
<P>Permit me a walk down memory lane for some other old computers...
<BR>
<P>In the summer of 1977 my father took a digital electronics course in
<BR>
San Diego, and received, in the course, a 6502 processor board (same
<BR>
as in the original Apple) of 1975/76 vintage. I think it was called
<BR>
a &quot;KIM&quot; computer. He built the power supply and the connections and
<BR>
encased it in plexiglass. It had 8K of RAM, and a hex keypad for
<BR>
communication and an edge connector for power and the data
<BR>
connections and a LED six digit display. To program it, one used
<BR>
hexidecimal commands and a cassette recorder.
<BR>
<P>My sisters and I used to play the game &quot;Wumpus&quot; (&quot;Find Wumpus or
<BR>
he'll find you!&quot;) on this strange little KIM computer. We had
<BR>
learned how to play the computer game Wumpus in the late 1960s when
<BR>
I was a kid in Hawaii and my parents had volunteered their time to
<BR>
help in the Transpacific Yacht race, and the handicap calculations
<BR>
for the yachts were performed daily. My parents dialed the large
<BR>
mainframe computer in Honolulu on a 300 baud acoustic modem and
<BR>
entered boat positions, and when the mainframe was not being used
<BR>
for the yacht calculations, my sisters and I played Wumpus or
<BR>
Blackjack.
<BR>
<P>My father gave me his old KIM about 5 years ago, and I tried to play
<BR>
Wumpus, but I was disappointed to learn that the &quot;Run&quot; button was
<BR>
kaput, so I left the computer with one of my Silicon Valley friends
<BR>
a couple of years ago when I moved to Germany. I'm looking forward
<BR>
to learning if he was able to fix it.
<BR>
<P>An Apple II and a Commodore 64 played a part in another part of my
<BR>
science past in the later 1980s and early 1990s. Even though these
<BR>
computers were not state-of-the art at that time, they were
<BR>
*portable*, and ideally suited to astronomers who travelled with
<BR>
their instruments to different telescopes to acquire data. The
<BR>
aspect that I liked about these little computers were that these
<BR>
simple, historic computers were in control of the key parts of our
<BR>
observations.
<BR>
<P>In the mid-80s to early-90s I worked for an infrared astronomer who
<BR>
provided one of the &quot;facility&quot; infrared instruments for the Kuiper
<BR>
Airborne Observatory (KAO). The KAO is a converted C-141 military
<BR>
cargo plane carrying a 36-inch reflecting telescope.
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://jean-luc.arc.nasa.gov/KAO/homepage.html">http://jean-luc.arc.nasa.gov/KAO/homepage.html</A>)
<BR>
<P>You can see a picture of the KAO telescope here:

<BR>
<P>and a view from the top:

<BR>
<P>I flew about a dozen times on KAO. The observing runs were about 6.5
<BR>
hours each, leaving from Moffett Field, California, and flying in a
<BR>
series of &quot;legs&quot;, dependent on the location of the objects that we
<BR>
were observing, but usually we would fly about half-way to Hawaii,
<BR>
in a triangle route, before turning around and flying home.
<BR>
<P>We attached our infrared spectrometer and guide-star hardware to the
<BR>
telescope, and the rest of our computer hardware, and us, were
<BR>
sitting in a few seats near the telescope and our bank of equipment.
<BR>
The cargo plane was very loud and therefore we communicated with
<BR>
each other through headsets throughout the night.
<BR>
<P>A long view inside the KAO:
<BR>
(the far end is the telescope, our computers were housed in the bank
<BR>
to the left in the next photo)
<BR>
<A HREF="http://ails.arc.nasa.gov/Images/Astrobiology/jpegs/AC90-0361-12_a.jpeg">http://ails.arc.nasa.gov/Images/Astrobiology/jpegs/AC90-0361-12_a.jpeg</A>
<BR>
<P>An  Apple II and a Commodore 64 controlled our KAO observations
<BR>
in the following way.
<BR>
<P>The KAO telescope rides on a cushion of air, so while the plane was
<BR>
flying, the telescope stayed fixed to the guiding star, and the
<BR>
plane &quot;revolved&quot; around the telescope. [When a person would watch
<BR>
the telescope, they would see an illusion of the telescope
<BR>
revolving/rotating, when actually it was the plane that was
<BR>
rotating.] The KAO operators had reasonable hardware and software to
<BR>
track on a guide-star while we observed our infrared objects, but our
<BR>
CCD camera hooked up to a Commodore 64, did a much better job.
<BR>
Therefore, we used our own system to track on a star, bypassing the
<BR>
plane's tracking system, which meant that a little Commodore 64 was
<BR>
providing the information to the rest of the plane for the
<BR>
navigational adjustments. In a sense, a Commodore 64 was controlling
<BR>
the directional movement of the plane during our observations!
<BR>
<P>Our infrared data was aqcuired by a vintage 1980s Apple II computer,
<BR>
with an A/D board inside that converted the data and then sent it to
<BR>
the Macintosh Plus (later a Mac II), housed next to the Apple in the
<BR>
bank; there my Mac Quickbasic software summed the photons,
<BR>
calculated fluxes and stored the data on a floppy disk. Even though
<BR>
Apple IIs were considered a small joke because of their processing
<BR>
power by the time that we were using them, we had very simple
<BR>
requirements for that computer, and it served our needs for a very
<BR>
long time. In fact other groups at NASA-Ames knew to give their old Apple
<BR>
IIs to us, so we usually had about 4 Apple IIs around, in various
<BR>
states of assembly, to use in our observing runs.
<BR>
<P>We used the same Apple II/Mac system of hardware and software for
<BR>
observing from ground-based telescopes too. I once talked to some of
<BR>
the managers at Apple, telling them how we used their computers,
<BR>
because I thought that it would be neat promo material for them, but
<BR>
they weren't particularly interested.
<BR>
<P>Thanks for the old computer memory lane walk. It's Labor Day weekend
<BR>
now in the States. Happy Labor Day weekend, everyone.
