Interesting analysis as always, Corwyn!
<BR>
<P>When thinking of how the changed technological and economical climate
<BR>
has affected the environmentalist movement, it makes sense to think
<BR>
about how it has affected transhumanism. Compare the transhumanism of
<BR>
the 80's and early 90's with today, and you see many changes there
<BR>
too. The old megascale projects and grand space colonisation plans
<BR>
have been replaced by bottom-up nanotech and infotech processes, just
<BR>
to point at an obvious example.
<BR>
<P>One could argue that the religionising of the environment is the
<BR>
result of many people being spoiled to some extent by a long period of
<BR>
peace, prosperity and good environment - it is always possible to
<BR>
demand a bit more than we have right now, and it often seems
<BR>
reasonable. Especially when people are not aware of the complex web of
<BR>
economic, social and technological relations that make up our society.
<BR>
Why have all those nasty nuclear power plants when we have electricity
<BR>
in the wall socket?
<BR>
<P>I think transhumanism can do a great deal of good by pointing at these
<BR>
interrelations, making people realise that they cannot have (say)
<BR>
advanced medicine without genetic engineering or a complex chemical
<BR>
infrastructure or their favorite foreign foods without a globalised
<BR>
market (or introduced species at home). This is the practical part,
<BR>
but we should not be afraid of dealing with the ethical/spiritual side
<BR>
too - we must be able to make a convincing argument for the ethics of
<BR>
our ideas.  Let's remind people that we are not just children of
<BR>
Mother Earth but of Father Sun too - and in the long run we might want
<BR>
to visit him.
