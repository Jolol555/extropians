<EM>&gt; &gt; You see, I see this country (USA) as our property; it's our asset. We 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; derive our living from it. The benefits from our work here accrue to us 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; large part).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think you need to add much more clarification to this concept.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, then...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it mean that the USA is our property?  What parts of the USA?  The land?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you saying that my land belongs collectivelly to the people of the US?  Or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do you just mean the businesses?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My company is owned by everyone else?
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps you are familiar with a certain business model:
<BR>
A group of people buy a piece of property. They own it *jointly*.
<BR>
They make improvements. They build facilities. It's a good location. They 
<BR>
prosper!
<BR>
<P>Each one is allocated a certain area, and there is also a common area. Each 
<BR>
sets up shop in his area, and they each obtain a living thusly. If there is 
<BR>
sufficient leftover common area, they may allow outsiders to become 
<BR>
partners. Newcomers must &quot;buy in&quot;, or perhaps they offer other inducments to 
<BR>
partnership; perhaps they will bring in additional business. The partners 
<BR>
may vote on allowing newcomers. Some partners may argue for, or against, 
<BR>
etc.
<BR>
<P>In any event, the current partners *decide* whether any newcomers are 
<BR>
allowed in.
<BR>
It is a (not necessarily equal) partnership.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then you suggest that if someone comes here and works, they're stealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my property?  What exactly are they stealing?  Suppose some guy stands on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the other side of the border and makes a basket, and I buy it from him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He is still stealing?  I don't see how it can become stealing simply if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he steps over the border before making his basket.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Back to the aforementioned business model:
<BR>
Suppose some Joe sneaks onto the property, and he sets up shop. He does 
<BR>
business. He makes money. Maybe he gives it to his wife, who knows.
<BR>
But he hasn't obtained permission; he is deriving benefits from the 
<BR>
partnership, but he hasn't obtained *permission*. He is, in the commonly 
<BR>
accepted parlance, a *thief*.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Even if you could come up with a principled reason to oppose immigration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(were your own immigrant ancestors stealing, BTW?),
</EM><BR>
<P>Different legal system. Why stop there? Go all the way back to monkeymen...
<BR>
I prefer to work towards a better future.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;would it still follow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that implanted IDs are a good idea?  Wouldn't you have to consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;costs and disadvantages of that technology before jumping in and saying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it is good?
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly it should be evaluated. Let's do so.
