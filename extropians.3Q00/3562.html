<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Any anabolic substances that promote extreme thickness of muscles
</EM><BR>
may/will be threatened to be made illegal, we have a serious
<BR>
anti-metahuman bias here..

<BR>
<P><P>This is an excellent example of how enhancing the body could
<BR>
become a legal battle when the world-wide interests of society
<BR>
along with enormous amounts of money are invested in the business
<BR>
of the human body and its physical capabilities under the umbrella
<BR>
of sports. 
<BR>
<P>The issue of where or not an athlete's enhancing her or his body
<BR>
while competing is a very involved issue.  What is enhancing?
<BR>
&nbsp;If a person performs TM (meditation for lowering he heart rate)
<BR>
prior to a competition is that person enhancing his/her body?
<BR>
&nbsp;What about an athlete who wears contacts, or puts extra padding
<BR>
in his sneakers?  Such are very mundane enhancements, but enhancements
<BR>
are relative.  What about the athlete who takes HRT or the diabetic
<BR>
who needs medication, the long distance jumper who wears knee
<BR>
pads, or the swimmer who wears a suit that glides through the
<BR>
water without friction.
<BR>
<P>The Olympic council will work around enhancing supplements and
<BR>
augmentations as the years unfold.  I envision a time when the
<BR>
Universal Olympics will be held off-planet and the athletes,
<BR>
human and transhuman, will be poster entities for body replacement
<BR>
parts, upgrades and advanced prosthetics.
<BR>
<P>But, getting back to this article, there is a part of me that
<BR>
understands why this is such a strong issue.  Yesterday at Gold's
<BR>
Gym I saw several human bodies that looked very steroid induced.
<BR>
&nbsp;While it wasn't particularly attractive to me, the few I saw
<BR>
thought they looked pretty darn good.  Should steriod bodies
<BR>
compete with non-steriod bodies?  Common sense would deem it
<BR>
an imbalance, and for good reason.  It would be more balanced
<BR>
if they competed with others who were taking the same enhancing
<BR>
substances and make this a separate event.
<BR>
<P>The future Olympics will be different and more varied. There
<BR>
is no way that in the year 2030 that the Olympics will be solely
<BR>
and exclusively for biological humans.
