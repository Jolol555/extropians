<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE SEPTEMBER 29 2000
<BR>
<P>OCTOBER IS BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH!
<BR>

<BR>
<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<BR>
Computer technology aids mammogram screening 
<BR>
<P>Widespread use of mammograms are in large part to thank for earlier breast
<BR>
cancer detection, however, according to a study published in the May 2000
<BR>
issue of the journal Radiology, up to 21 percent of early stage breast
<BR>
cancers are missed by routine mammography. A new service called CloserLook
<BR>
can help radiologists diagnose 15 to 20 percent more of these cancers. 
<BR>
<P>CloserLook, which will be available through many mammography centers in
<BR>
this country and via internet through iMammogram.com, provides computer
<BR>
aided detection (CAD) analysis of mammograms. This technology marks
<BR>
suspicious areas, aiding radiologists in their examination of the
<BR>
mammogram. The Radiology study examined prior mammograms from women whose
<BR>
current mammograms resulted in a biopsy that confirmed cancer. The CAD
<BR>
system correctly indicated cancer in 89 of 115 of the prior mammograms
<BR>
determined by a panel of radiologist to indicate early cancer, and which
<BR>
were missed by the patient's original radiologist. 
<BR>
<P>Women who wish to have their mammograms evaluated by CloserLook can go to
<BR>
the www.imammogram.com and arrange to have their mammogram films released.
<BR>
The mammogram is computer analyzed, and the mammogram returned to the
<BR>
center that performed it. The patient's radiologist can then compare his
<BR>
diagnosis to the computer analysis. 
<BR>
<P>iMammogram.com founder Larry Chespak MD commented, &quot; CAD is becoming
<BR>
widely recognized in the medical community as an effective means of
<BR>
identifying subtle abnormalities that the naked eye might miss. Mammograms
<BR>
are very difficult to interpret, and CAD is a tool to help radiologists
<BR>
decrease errors due to oversight . . . At iMammogram.com, we want to make
<BR>
CAD technology available to women everywhere.The earlier breast cancer is
<BR>
detected, the earlier treatment can begin and the more lives we can save.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>WHAT'S HOT
<BR>
Breast Cancer Detection Breakthrough
<BR>
A few drops of blood can now tell if a woman has the most aggressive type
<BR>
of breast cancer and to what extent metastasis has occurred. In only a few
<BR>
hours, an automated test can tell breast cancer patients how much of a
<BR>
particular protein shed by cancerous cells exists in the blood, which
<BR>
greatly aids physicians in their treatment approach. 
<BR>
<P>One third of the 900,000 breast cancer patients worldwide have aggressive,
<BR>
invasive breast cancer. The new test, which even detects free floating
<BR>
cancer cells in the body, will help to determine the extent of treatment
<BR>
that will be used after the primary tumor has been surgically excised. The
<BR>
test will also enable physicians to monitor the progress of patients'
<BR>
chemotherapy treatments, so that they may alter the dosage or medication
<BR>
if it is not providing the desired anticancer effect. 
<BR>
<P>The test works through the use of cloned mouse antibodies to Her2/neu
<BR>
proteins, which are fragments of cancer cells. Test developer Bayer
<BR>
cultures the antibodies and adds iron to part of them, to the others is
<BR>
added a colored marker. If the patient's serum (the liquid portion of
<BR>
blood which is separated from red blood cells) contains Her2/neu proteins,
<BR>
the antibodies to these proteins will adhere to them, both color-marking
<BR>
them and making them magnetic by the presence of iron. The cells to which
<BR>
the antibodies have adhered can be separated from the serum by a magnet
<BR>
and the color intensity is examined which when evaluated can indicate the
<BR>
total amount of cancer cells in the blood.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This blood test will help the physician to detect the breast cancer
<BR>
earlier, and will allow the physician to tailor the treatment for each
<BR>
individual woman differently and specifically,&quot; commented Dr Walter P
<BR>
Carney, of Bayer.

<BR>
<P>Fewer mastectomies needed
<BR>
<P>The July 19 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute
<BR>
published the long term results of a randomized multicenter trial in which
<BR>
868 women with breast cancer were given either breast conserving therapy
<BR>
(BCT) or a modified radical mastectomy. Breast conserving therapy
<BR>
consisted of a lumpectomy with removal of a margin of one centimeter
<BR>
around the tumor and radiation. The trial was conducted between 1980 and
<BR>
1986 and the patients were followed up for a median of 13.4 years. Eighty
<BR>
percent of the women in the study had tumors measuring between 2.1 and 5
<BR>
centimeters. At the present, only women with tumors 2 centimeters or
<BR>
smaller are routinely given breast conserving therapy, while women with
<BR>
larger tumors are advised to undergo mastectomy. Prior research has
<BR>
demonstrated BCT to be as effective as mastectomy in women with these
<BR>
smaller tumors. 
<BR>
<P>After ten years, survival was 65% in those who received BCT and 66% in
<BR>
those receiving the mastectomy, considered to be statistically the same.
<BR>
Women who retained their breasts had a somewhat higher rate of recurrence,
<BR>
but this still had no effect on their survival rate. The two groups also
<BR>
experienced approximately the same rate of metastasis, with 66% of those
<BR>
undergoing a mastectomy remaining free of metastasis in distant locations
<BR>
as compared to 61% of those who received breast conserving therapy.

<BR>
<P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Breast cancer
<BR>
<P>Like most other cancers, once breast cancer has been detected there is
<BR>
already the chance that the disease has spread. Once a lump has been
<BR>
discovered on the breast or even discovered early on a mammogram, there
<BR>
may already be an average of 45 billion cancer cells present, and some of
<BR>
these malignant cells may have metastasized to other parts of the body. As
<BR>
in other types of cancer, conventional medicine stages the disease based
<BR>
on certain factors including tumor size, presence of lymph node
<BR>
involvement, or distal spread. Depending on the stage, the oncologist may
<BR>
recommend a number of options and combinations ranging from simple
<BR>
lumpectomy to complete mastectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy. 
<BR>
<P>Although the cause of breast cancer has not been found, it has become
<BR>
clear that hormonal manipulation may have a therapeutic impact on the
<BR>
course of the disease. This is why the tumors, when removed during
<BR>
surgery, are studied to find whether or not they are so-called
<BR>
estrogen-receptor positive or negative. If the cancer is estrogen-receptor
<BR>
positive, theoretically there should be a response to manipulation of
<BR>
estrogen. This is exactly the role tamoxifen has played as an adjuvant
<BR>
drug therapy in the treatment of the disease.
<BR>
<P>Melatonin and vitamin D3 have been shown to synergistically enhance the
<BR>
beneficial effects of tamoxifen, and for this reason, women taking
<BR>
tamoxifen should also take 4000 to 6000 IU of vitamin D3 and 3 to 50 mg of
<BR>
melatonin nightly. While tamoxifen's side effects may limit its use to 2
<BR>
years, most people can take melatonin and moderate doses of vitamin D3
<BR>
indefinitely. A few people experience kidney toxicity and abnormal calcium
<BR>
metabolism when taking high doses of vitamin D3, and breast cancer
<BR>
patients are also at a high risk for developing blood calcium disorders.
<BR>
For all these reasons, breast cancer patients who use therapeutic doses of
<BR>
vitamin D3 (4000 to 6000 IU a day) should have a regular blood chemistry
<BR>
panel that will reveal kidney toxicity and calcium imbalances while these
<BR>
problems are still reversible. 
<BR>
<P>Vitamin A and vitamin D3 inhibit breast cancer cell division and can
<BR>
induce cancer cells to differentiate into mature, noncancer cells. Vitamin
<BR>
D3 works synergistically with tamoxifen (and melatonin) to inhibit breast
<BR>
cancer cell proliferation. Breast cancer patients should take 4000 to 6000
<BR>
IU of vitamin D3 every day on an empty stomach. Water-soluble vitamin A
<BR>
can be taken in doses of 100,000 to 300,000 IU every day. Monthly blood
<BR>
tests are needed to make sure toxicity does not occur in response to these
<BR>
relatively high daily doses of vitamin A and vitamin D3. After 4 to 6
<BR>
months, the doses of vitamin D3 and vitamin A can be reduced.

<P><P>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<BR>
<P>Vitamin A liquid drops
<BR>
<P>Cancer patients whose doctors will not prescribe Vitamin-A analog drugs
<BR>
often turn to a liquid emulsified Vitamin-A. Vitamin-A and its analogs
<BR>
have shown specific cancer cell differentiation enhancing properties and
<BR>
inhibitory effects on the proliferation of some cancer cell lines,
<BR>
especially leukemia and certain head and neck cancers. Cancer patients
<BR>
often take four to eight drops a day, six out of seven days. Cancer
<BR>
patients are urged to follow the Vitamin-A precautions to help guard
<BR>
against potential Vitamin-A overdose and toxicity. Vitamin-A precautions
<BR>
are available by calling 1-800-544-4440 and are automatically sent with
<BR>
each bottle of Emulsified Vitamin-A Drops. Thyroid cancer patients, or
<BR>
anyone with severe thyroid hormone deficiency should not take Vitamin-A
<BR>
supplements. 
<BR>
<P>Each drop of Emulsified Liquid Vitamin A contains: 20,000 iu of vitamin-A
<BR>
(palmitate).
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/prod_hp/php401.html">http://www.lef.org/prod_hp/php401.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Vitamin D capsules 1000 iu
<BR>
<P>Vitamin D is necessary for the utilization of calcium and phosphorous, and
<BR>
for the assimilation of vitamin A. This synthetic form of vitamin D has
<BR>
been used to prevent and treat breast cancer and prostate cancer. 
<BR>
<P>When taking more than 1300 IU of vitamin D3 a day, periodic blood tests
<BR>
should be done to make sure too much calcium is not being absorbed.
