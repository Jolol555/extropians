</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't you do some calculations on conversion of grain to ethanol a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; short while back?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, but it was just a back of the envelope calc.  I got the numbers
<BR>
from a site that was unapologetically pro-farm.  For instance, they
<BR>
often used the phrase &quot;will help corn prices&quot; and &quot;improve corn
<BR>
prices&quot; to mean *increase* the price.  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What conversion efficiency were you talking about and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what technology were you basing that on?
</EM><BR>
<P>All standard nothing-tricky today-tech, no GM.  In rough numbers it
<BR>
was 150 bushels per acre-year, 2.5 gallons ethanol per bushel,
<BR>
then figuring closed loop (using ethanol in the harvesting, processing,
<BR>
water delivery and fermentation etc, you get about 38% as I
<BR>
recall, so it comes out to about a gallon per bushel of corn or
<BR>
about 150 gallons per acre year, which in understandable units
<BR>
comes to about 1400-ish liters per hectare year.  So I figure
<BR>
all the land under cultivation in the US, if planted in corn and
<BR>
fermented would take care of about a third of our energy use,
<BR>
which gave me a new respect for how much energy we devour.
<BR>
Those were outdated (1989) numbers for energy use, and
<BR>
Barbara pointed out that it is probably higher now with the
<BR>
popularity of Detroit urban assault vehicles.
<BR>
<P>I did have a kind of disturbing thought about this as I imagined
<BR>
converting some of the unused American open space into
<BR>
corn fields: if we did do something like that, we might need to
<BR>
come up with some tricky new technology to kill birds!  Perhaps
<BR>
a radar tracking system with a pulse laser or something.  The
<BR>
greens wouldnt like that one damn bit.  Im thinking something
<BR>
like that could be adapted for popping locusts outta the air too,
<BR>
which actually sounds like it would be kinda cool to work on.
<BR>
Our military high energy lasers and tracking systems could be
<BR>
adapted I would think.  I havent a guess on how to keep the
<BR>
green vandals from destoying the things.
<BR>
<P>Im looking at buying a hybrid car.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are you aware of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technologies that would be more efficient than yeast based fermentation?
</EM><BR>
<P>Havent looked into it.  How about if you find us a site with
<BR>
some numbers?  spike
