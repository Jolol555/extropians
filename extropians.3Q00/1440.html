My friend Michael Goldfarb sent me this well-written review
<BR>
today, and with his permission I'm re-posting it here, since the
<BR>
movie deals (however fantastically) with issues of relevance to
<BR>
this list, and since Michael's review complements Robert
<BR>
J. Bradbury's post from last Friday.
<BR>

<BR>
Subject: X-Men... in a word, eXcellent!
<BR>
<P>Friends - If you've ever enjoyed a Marvel comic, there is cause
<BR>
for rejoicing this weekend: the new X-Men film represents
<BR>
Marvel's long-delayed arrival as a purveyor of classy film
<BR>
material. Whereas DC got there decades ago with the '78 Superman
<BR>
and '89 Batman films, Marvel's wondrous creations haven't fared
<BR>
very well in film or TV adaptations... until now.
<BR>
<P>What is most impressive about the medium-budget (around $75 or
<BR>
$85 million) film is that absolutely captures the heart and soul
<BR>
of X-Men comics both old and recent, and the &quot;realistic&quot; Marvel
<BR>
approach in general. As opposed to the
<BR>
flashy-spectacle-and-almost-nonexistent-substance of last year's
<BR>
far more expensive and higher-profile Star Wars Episode I, this
<BR>
film has a high degree of solid characterization, and a
<BR>
discernible story and moral. Sure, there are also way-cool
<BR>
special effects, makeup, sets, and action sequences... but they
<BR>
serve the story, rather than being the raison d'etre for the film
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P>X-Men distills almost 40 years of X-lore into a new synthesis
<BR>
that keeps the best aspects of each approach, a la the recent
<BR>
animated Batman series, and quickly gets to the ideas that are at
<BR>
the center of the X-Men's attraction: the pain of being
<BR>
different, the horrors of baseless fear and prejudice, the threat
<BR>
of power corrupting, and the awful spectacle of man's inhumanity
<BR>
to man... not to mention all those cool mutant powers. Along the
<BR>
way, it skillfully sketches in the familiar characters, some in
<BR>
brief but effective strokes (Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey) and some
<BR>
in substantial detail (Wolverine, Rogue, Professor X and his
<BR>
friend/adversary Magneto). The character writing is very well
<BR>
done, with the essential &quot;reality&quot; aspects that are the highlight
<BR>
of the Marvel approach (e.g., superpowers don't make it easier to
<BR>
be a success with the opposite sex or pay your bills) very much
<BR>
in evidence.
<BR>
<P>The performances are excellent right down the line, with Patrick
<BR>
Stewart - as expected - as fine a Prof. X as he is a
<BR>
Capt. Picard. (He actually has far less screen time than you
<BR>
might expect, but he certainly makes the most of it.) Ian
<BR>
McKellen brings a dignity to Magneto that you may not expect -
<BR>
this is not the original Lee/Kirby supervillain, but a later
<BR>
variant that contains many shades of gray. Anna Paquin's young
<BR>
Rogue is very touching, and Famke Jansen's Jean Grey, Halle
<BR>
Berry's Storm, and James Marsden's Cyclops are all
<BR>
good. Magneto's henchmen are mostly far less interesting, though
<BR>
Ray Park's acrobatics as Toad bring his performance last year as
<BR>
Darth Maul into sharper focus.
<BR>
<P>Then there's virtual unknown Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in a
<BR>
performance that can only be described as &quot;star-making&quot;. This guy
<BR>
commands the screen whenever he's in sight, and more than holds
<BR>
his own against heavyweight thespians Stewart and McKellen. He is
<BR>
the central character in the film, and he carries if off
<BR>
beautifully. Though his Wolverine is a bit less larger than life
<BR>
than the comics version, he absolutely makes the film... it's not
<BR>
unlike when Christopher Reeve first played Superman, a wonderful
<BR>
revelation.
<BR>
<P>To be sure, the film isn't perfect: the pacing is sometimes off,
<BR>
some of the pseudoscience is questionable even in comic-book
<BR>
terms, and there are plot twists that don't make much sense. And
<BR>
at 95 minutes, it's just not long enough, with a &quot;big&quot; ending
<BR>
that doesn't play out all that well, and a very rushed
<BR>
resolution. Even with these minor problems (which I still think
<BR>
are smaller than those of the '78 Superman and the '89 Batman
<BR>
movies), the film is a total joy to the 10-year-old in all of us,
<BR>
and I just can't wait for the sequel(s).
<BR>
<P>Stan Lee is reportedly thrilled with the film (and supposedly has
<BR>
a cameo as a hot dog vendor, though I didn't spot him), as are
<BR>
more recent X-creators Chris Claremont and others. And somewhere
<BR>
in the big bullpen in the sky, Jack Kirby is definitely
<BR>
smiling...
<BR>
<P>Bryan Singer and company have done a fine job with this film. It
<BR>
certainly bodes well for the upcoming big-budget Spider-Man and
<BR>
Fantastic Four projects now getting into production. (And the
<BR>
other dozen Marvel adaptations in various stages of preproducton
<BR>
planning as well.) It's high time that these 20th-century
<BR>
classics came to the screen in their full glory. Find yourself a
<BR>
10-year-old to see it with (or just access your inner
<BR>
10-year-old) and enjoy. Excelsior!
<BR>
<P>Nuff said. - MSG
