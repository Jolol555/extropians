<EM>&gt; If I was in a position to be cryonically suspended (which I don't think I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Oz), I think I would make it very, very clear that I *volunteer* for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first uploading experiments. All the better if the general public thinks I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dead, it is likely to be very difficult to organise if you fit the more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commonly accepted definition of being alive. I would hope that someone alive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at the time of the experiments actually gave a damn about me, and where I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually ended up, but if not, well, I'd still rather be on the front
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line. Exploit me, I don't care; becoming one of the first few Posthumans has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; got to come with a price tag. And ye gods, the payoff...
</EM><BR>
<P>But can this be considered *informed* consent?  You don't know anything
<BR>
about the procedure, you don't know what the risks are.  Would you
<BR>
volunteer if there was a 99%+ chance that your brain would simply be
<BR>
destroyed and we'd get some partial information out of it, that might
<BR>
guide future uploads?  Would you volunteer if there was a large chance
<BR>
that a successful upload would be inordinately unpleasant, full of
<BR>
sensory deprivation, madness and pain?
<BR>
<P>At best, someone considering using an old cryonic suspension patient for
<BR>
these experiments would need to see a full legal document, laying out all
<BR>
possible circumstances, and describing whether the patient would permit
<BR>
the experiment in each case.  Even then it is questionable whether the
<BR>
subject could fully understand the ramifications of what he is agreeing
<BR>
to, without having up to date information on the details of the procedure.
<BR>
<P>I believe a superior approach, if you want subjects for a destructive
<BR>
upload, would be to use people on their deathbeds.  Promise to pay
<BR>
their families millions of dollars if they agree; give them all kinds
<BR>
of documentation on the procedure and the possible consequences, good
<BR>
and bad.  Give them tomes by philosophers and ethicists which will debate
<BR>
whether an upload could be alive, whether it would be the &quot;same&quot; person
<BR>
as them, whether it would suffer or rejoice at its new life.
<BR>
<P>In this way you can get fully informed consent to the procedure, and you
<BR>
can probably get a brain which is in much better shape than dragging out
<BR>
a decades old cryonics patient from the 20th century.
