<EM>&gt; &gt; Okay, so why would I necessarily need more than a finite and limited amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; charisma to handle that?  If I needed incredibly skilled and talented hackers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to act as janitors, then yes, I (or someone) would need a lot of charisma.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But attracting people to the most important job in the entire world?  How much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; leadership talent do you need for *that*?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Little would be needed if it was as obvious as it appears to be to you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A great deal is needed to make it more obvious in actuality.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no reason to believe that all persons bright enough and motivated enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be useful to the work will &quot;get it&quot; the first time around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually herding the cats once you've got them, now, that's another issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So's PR.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wish I knew more about dealing with people, but I no longer give it as high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a priority as I once did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; How can that be anything but a mistake when you require people, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are the only intelligences to use in getting this thing off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; ground, and their resources in order to produce the Seed?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My purpose, above all else, is to design the Seed.  Other people can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; persuade.  I have to complete the design.  If being charismatic requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; patterns of thought that interfere with my ability to complete the design, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even if it starts taking up too much time, then forget charismatic.  I'll stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the basement and someone else will be charismatic instead.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's fair enough.  As long as you have some people to do the necessary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job of explanation and persuasion all should be reasonably well on that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; score.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that all of those you need will just automatically think enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; like you or agree enough with your conclusions that little/no effort is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary on your part to understand and deal with them further?   What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of model leads you to this conclusion?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Past experience, actually.  The people I need seem to Get It on the first try,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; generally speaking.  I'm not saying that they don't argue with me, or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they don't ask questions.  Mitchell Porter has been right where I have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wrong, on a major issue, on at least two separate occasions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or at least all the people you know you can work with and/or are on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; board today got it quickly (or at least seemingly so in hindsight).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The difference is pretty hard to put into words.  I am not the judge of who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or isn't asking &quot;intelligent questions&quot;, and that's not what I'm trying to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say.  What I'm trying to say rather is that there is a pattern.  Mitchell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Porter groks the pattern; if he says, &quot;Eliezer, you're flat wrong about X&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; then at least we're both arguing within the same pattern.  People who Get It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; may agree or disagree with me, but they understand the pattern.  Rarely, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ever, do I see someone who didn't get the pattern suddenly get it after long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and acrimonious argument; the only person I can ever recall seeing do that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Eric Watt Forste, which still impresses me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But it is certainly within the possible that the basic pattern itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has some flaws or at least reasonably questionable spots.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's certainly within the possible that *I* have some flaws or at least
<BR>
reasonably questionable spots, and indeed people like Mitchell Porter have
<BR>
spotted flaws and questioned questionable spots.
<BR>
<P>That the pattern is wrong - that Mitchell Porter and I are both totally
<BR>
off-base and J.R. Molloy is right - is rather less likely.  Imagine you toss
<BR>
back three physicists into the fourteenth century.  Some alchemist spots them
<BR>
arguing and decides to propound his own theory about a world built on five
<BR>
mystical elements.  The physicists may argue with each other, but they share a
<BR>
single pattern, and the alchemist doesn't have it - and either you see it or
<BR>
you don't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For myself I think one reason I question this so much is because it both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is something that strongly appeals to me for several reasons and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that repels me simultaneously.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure I can help you with that one, but it sounds to me like you're
<BR>
making the decision a lot harder than it is.
