<P>
<EM>&gt;Froim: Paul Hughes
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;why are the only paying these poor bastards less than a dollar per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CD?  Where is all that other money going.  Lets see, I'm thinking for a
</EM><BR>
moment -
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I got it - the executives paychecks!! 
</EM><BR>
<P>In the music industry like any other kind of business 90% of everything is a
<BR>
flop. Probably even more so in the music industry. 85% of all music you see
<BR>
in the stores never makes back the production costs.
<BR>
<P>Oh and there is adult people in the music business making money .. uhhh bad
<BR>
bad.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Lets not forget those multi-million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dollar hyping budgets in order to get N'Sync and Brittany Spears albums to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;market.  Give me a friggin break!
</EM><BR>
<P>Is marketing Unethical? You are not allowed to tell that you have something
<BR>
to sell .. it is evil ???
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, actually, the real difference here is that blacksmiths were being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; replaced by something that did their job better.  That's called progress.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Exactly!  The internet is progress
</EM><BR>
<P>Not if we let it destroy the economical system.
<BR>
<P>If it is possible and legal to just copy something for free we will never
<BR>
know it's actual worth. How much would people be willing to pay for it. And
<BR>
also how much is it worth for society. Forget about the free market. There
<BR>
will be no market... only free.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;He made it, he promoted it, I listen to it.  I hear it on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the radio, I hear it on MTV.  I recorded it on MTV.  I play it whenever I
</EM><BR>
want.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Then along comes Napster and I can find the same song and record it on my
</EM><BR>
hard
<BR>
<EM>&gt;drive - and now it's a crime?  This is the most convoluted crap I have ever
</EM><BR>
been
<BR>
<EM>&gt;dis-privaleged to expose my brain to.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh but you are not able to listen to it on a walkman. You have to use a
<BR>
videotape to play it back which is a hassle. And there are several other
<BR>
reasons why you would want you music on a CD. Those reasons sort of
<BR>
dissapear on MP3. It is a better medium in many regards than any other there
<BR>
has been for music. Excluding sound quality. In short in the other mediums
<BR>
there are barriers to entry that most people don't record their music that
<BR>
way. At least not in a big way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; No one has proven that Napster is going to result in better music or ...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No one has proven that its going to make music worse either. Nothing can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worse than the over-marketed hype they call music now-a-days.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is your taste you are stating. Not really a valid argument.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Then of course we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have all the extremely talented musicians that I hear at small concerts
</EM><BR>
around
<BR>
<EM>&gt;this part of the country.  They have not inked million dollar contracts,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;their music is easily as good as the rich pop stars.  So what's motivating
</EM><BR>
them
<BR>
<EM>&gt;- perhaps the pure love of music?  Oh I forgot, its not about the music in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;end - its the money, money, moneyaaa, .....moneyaaaaa!
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh artist cannot make money???
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Hey, Linux is not the only example of something really cool that people
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; made without getting paid for it.  There will likely continue to be many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; shining examples of what humans will do for free.  And humans will
</EM><BR>
continue
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; to do really interesting things for free.
</EM><BR>
<P>Linux is very nice but it is a tool somebody has made so they don't have to
<BR>
pay for the tools from other. Free hammers would also be nice for the
<BR>
carpentry business but would destroy the hammer business. So you can turn it
<BR>
around and say that if people want free music they should make it themself.
<BR>
Just like the Linux crowd supposedly does.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For now yes, but thats the whole point of my argument.  There is going to
</EM><BR>
come a
<BR>
<EM>&gt;point, when nanotechnology really hits hard and all this IP hogwash has to
</EM><BR>
go.
<BR>
<P>Oh yeas ... let's destroy the economic system right now, so that we can
<BR>
prepare for something that might happen sometime in the future. Remember
<BR>
Nano is not here yet. It might never be or maybe only partial.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Ah yes, but intellectual property is being used to squash new technologies
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;eliminate the real potential of what the internet is.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is a big world with many people making a living in different stages of
<BR>
technological savy. We have to change the system slowly enough as not to
<BR>
destroy it.
<BR>
