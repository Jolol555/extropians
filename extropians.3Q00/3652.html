<EM>&gt; I've done a fair amount of desert hiking (including a solo hike across Joshua 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tree in late July without caches and in about 54 hours) and quite naturally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought a good bit about equipment.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Just to throw in my two cents, I concur with what Tom suggested.  I've
<BR>
spent a lot of time in the deep desert and dress in a similar fashion,
<BR>
with minor differences.  A big thumbs up for the military surplus desert
<BR>
pants.  However, I would recommend selecting the lightweight cotton
<BR>
ripstop fabric instead of the heavier polyester/cotton fabric.  The
<BR>
polyester blend provides much better insulation and doesn't breathe as
<BR>
well, whereas the ripstop cotton is designed for hot weather use at the
<BR>
expense of durability.  Both fabrics are military issue and are used for
<BR>
all standard military patterns.  I personally go for straight khaki color,
<BR>
without a desert camo pattern.
<BR>
<P>For shirts, I use long-sleeve cotton mock turtlenecks in a light color. 
<BR>
However, actually finding one of these shirts in a lightweight fabric with
<BR>
a loose cut takes some searching, as most people assume turtlenecks will
<BR>
be worn in cold weather and design them accordingly.  Occasionally, I will
<BR>
wear two layers of shirts, a relatively tight inner one (e.g. a cotton
<BR>
tshirt) and a baggy button-down outer layer.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I've experimented with a couple of hats, neither of which I rate as ideal.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The standard-issue army desert cap works OK, but has a fairly narrow brim 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that won't protect you from sidelong light and reflected glare.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There are actually multiple &quot;army issue&quot; caps, so I am not sure which one
<BR>
is being referred to.  I personally use military issue &quot;boonie&quot; hats,
<BR>
though I tend to put the sides up using the retention strap.  I've found
<BR>
this to work reasonably well for me, giving me front and back cover in the
<BR>
way that I wear it and keeping the head cool quite well (it has vents near
<BR>
the top).  I do wear appropriate sunglasses, so glare is not too much of a
<BR>
problem.
<BR>
<P>And plenty of water.
<BR>
<P>I've settled on this general configuration for most of my desert time. 
<BR>
The most extreme conditions I've put this through was four days in the
<BR>
desert south of Tucson, Arizona last summer with the temperature doing
<BR>
120+F during the day.  Hot but comfortable.
