<EM>&gt; Yes, the 10 lines/day metric includes all direct and indirect development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and support costs, so it doesn't really reflect coding speed per se.  Note
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this type of accounting is how you apparently have the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spending $400 on a hammer and similar; they include the direct and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indirect costs at all steps of acquisition/production rather than using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;on paper&quot; purchase price.  While arguably more accurate, it isn't an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intuitive accounting methodology for the layman.
</EM><BR>
<P>Life would be very easy if I could bill a ten hour day against ten lines of
<BR>
code.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, 80k lines of good code in 3 months does sound a bit far-fetched.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 30k LoC in 8 months is very reasonable though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I bet that 30,000 or 80,000 lines of code was riddled with bugs!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It depends on the programmer and the environment.  For example, I write
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nearly bug-free code using C on UNIX at an extremely high number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; LoC/day, but tend to have much buggier code and program at a slower
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rate if I do something in, say, Perl.  For me, these two environments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty much represent both the best and worst case scenarios for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environments that I commonly use.  C++, Java, and various 4GLs fall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere in the middle.  I'm sure there are programmers whose coding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preferences with respect to bugginess are exactly opposite of mine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Everyone creates bugs. When you are really good in a particular environment,
<BR>
you end up attempting more complex systems; just as many bugs. I find it
<BR>
entertaining that people pay you to create bugs, then pay you more to remove
<BR>
them. It's like a job digging holes and filling them in again.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a suspicion that people who are really good at programming have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brains that are wired slightly differently than the rest of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population.  Every really good natural programmer I have known was able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to write nearly bug-free code very fast in their preferred environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This doesn't actually speak for the efficiency of the environment, only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the particular way a programmer is wired.  However, in my experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the majority of people working as programmers don't have an innate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognitive ability with respect to programming and tend to write relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buggy code in any environment by comparison.  Every successful development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; team seems to have at least one &quot;natural&quot; programmer on board, and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disproportionate percentage of the final codebase is typically written by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these individuals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Like an idiot savant, it's a mixed blessing.
