<EM>&gt; The question though, if you are going to maintain that the 'death squads'
</EM><BR>
(they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; obviously don't call themselves that, its a moniker applied by leftist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propagandists), especially considering the marxists have killed far more

private
<BR>
<EM>&gt; citizens than the 'right wing death squads' have, yet I don't see the
</EM><BR>
media
<BR>
<EM>&gt; complaining about 'left wing death squads', as if the people they kill

deserve

<P>While I rarely agree with you on political issues, this is a fine point.  I
<BR>
once watched a documentary on the Phillipine guerilla movement on PBS in the
<BR>
early 1990s.  It talked about how the Right wingers were killing people.  It
<BR>
also showed a heavy Nazi influence on the Right wingers and their &quot;God
<BR>
centered ideology.&quot;  (This, in itself was scarey enough.  The appeal of
<BR>
Naziism extends far outside White supremacists, you know?)  Then it actually
<BR>
showed a Leftist group, which during the filming killed someone.  The
<BR>
killing was done by capturing the person, carrying him up into the hills,
<BR>
trying him (only guerillas at his trial, if my memory's correct), then
<BR>
executing him and returning his body to his family.
<BR>
<P>While this was a nice gesture, the documentary did not question the fact
<BR>
that they [the Leftists] murdered someone.  The documentary tried to make it
<BR>
look like due process, like, as you put it, the guy deserved it.  You're
<BR>
dragged from your bed in the middle of the night and some people take you
<BR>
out into the woods and decide your fate.  Sounds like a mockery of justice
<BR>
to me.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
