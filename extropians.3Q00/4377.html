A few questions remain
<BR>
<P>1: what were the results of HI
<BR>
2: what is the result of occlusion + HI
<BR>
3: what were the Percent increases in both cross-sectional area and 
<BR>
isokinetic strength of elbow flexor muscles, and what exact physiogical 
<BR>
change(s) occured, and how long did it last.
<BR>
4: what was the total time under tension, an what was the rest between sets
<BR>
5: was this a full range or partial range of motion movement
<BR>
6: what were the insulin and glucagon levels
<BR>
7: were these trained or untrained subjects?

<P>Effects of Resistance Exercise Combined With Moderate
<BR>
Vascular Occlusion on Muscular Function in Humans
<BR>
<P>Journal of  Applied Physiology 88(6): 2097-106 June 2000
<BR>
<P>Abstract:  Acute and long-term effects of resistance exercise
<BR>
combined with vascular occlusion on muscular function were
<BR>
investigated. Changes in integrated electromyogram with
<BR>
respect to time (iEMG), vascular resistive index, and plasma
<BR>
lactate concentration were measured in five men either during
<BR>
or after elbow flexion exercises with the proximal end of the
<BR>
arm occluded at 0-100 mmHg. The mean iEMG, postexercise
<BR>
hyperemia, and plasma lactate concentration were all elevated
<BR>
with the increase in occlusion pressure at a low-intensity exercise,
<BR>
whereas they were unchanged with the increase in occlusion
<BR>
pressure at high-intensity exercise. To investigate the long-term
<BR>
effects of low-intensity exercise with occlusion, older women
<BR>
(n = 24) were subjected to a 16-wk exercise training for elbow
<BR>
flexor muscles, in which low-intensity [approximately 50-30%
<BR>
one repetition maximum (1 RM) exercise with occlusion at
<BR>
approximately 110 mmHg (LIO), low-intensity exercise without
<BR>
occlusion (LI), and high- to medium-intensity (approximately
<BR>
80-50% 1 RM) exercise without occlusion (HI) were performed.
<BR>
Percent increases in both cross-sectional area and isokinetic
<BR>
strength of elbow flexor muscles after LIO were larger than those
<BR>
after LI (P&lt;0.05) and similar to those after HI. The results suggest
<BR>
that resistance exercise at an intensity even lower than 50% 1 RM
<BR>
is effective in inducing muscular hypertropy and concomitant
<BR>
increase in strength when combined with vascular occlusion.

<P>Rapid Increase in Plasma Growth Hormone After
<BR>
Low-Intensity Resistance Exercise With Vascular Occlusion.
<BR>
<P>Journal of Applied Physiology 88(1): 61-5 January 2000
<BR>
<P>Abstract:  Hormonal and inflammatory responses to low-intensity
<BR>
resistance exercise with vascular occlusion were studied. Subjects
<BR>
(n=6) performed bilateral leg extension exercise in the seated
<BR>
position, with the proximal end of their thigh compressed at 214
<BR>
+/- 7.7 (SE) mmHg throughout the session of exercise by means
<BR>
of a pressure tourniquet. Mean intensity and quantity of the exercise
<BR>
were 20% of 1 repetition maximum and 14 repetitions x 5 sets,
<BR>
respectively. In each set, the subjects repeated the movement
<BR>
until exhaustion. Plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH),
<BR>
norepinephrine (NE), lactate (La), lipid peroxide (LP), interleukin-6
<BR>
(IL-6), and activity of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) were measured
<BR>
before and after the exercise was finished and the tourniquet was
<BR>
released. Concentrations of GH, NE, and La consistently showed
<BR>
marked, transient increases after the exercise with occlusion,
<BR>
whereas they did not change a great deal after the exercise without
<BR>
occlusion (control) done at the same intensity and quantity. Notably,
<BR>
concentration of GH reached a level approximately 290 times as
<BR>
high as that of the resting level 15 min after the exercise. IL-6
<BR>
concentration showed a much more gradual increase and was
<BR>
maintained at a slightly higher level than in the control even 24 h
<BR>
after exercise. Concentrations of LP and CPK showed no significant
<BR>
change. The results suggest that extremely light resistance exercise
<BR>
combined with occlusion greatly stimulates the secretion of GH
<BR>
though regional acculation of metabolites without considerable
<BR>
tissue damage.
