<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Whyncha come clean and publicly admit what you, as an NRA member,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must already know - that the emotional appeals to the second half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the second amendment are meant to inflame the faithful, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to convince the courts?  You know full well that the NRA has never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contested a gun regulation on second amendment grounds - because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they know that it's a losing judicial argument, since the courts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will not recognize your organization's particular eisegesis as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;either relevant or valid.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many gun laws have been contested Joe, the FACT is that the Supreme
<BR>
Court has always ducked this issue.
<BR>
<P>The so called second half of the Second Amendment is actually the
<BR>
first, the so called first part is conditional on the second.
<BR>
Try reading U.S vs EMERSON for a federal judge's opinion.
<BR>
<P>Actually thanks to the efforts of a Federal judge, we may finally
<BR>
have a resolution to this. By rejecting the government's case on
<BR>
Second Amendment grounds in U.S. vs EMERSON, a case now headed for
<BR>
the Supreme Court, we may finally get a ruling on this.
<BR>
<P>I predict the court will duck the issue once again.
<BR>
<P>By the way, the people you are collaborating with are not
<BR>
interested in &quot;sensible&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot; gun laws, they are
<BR>
interested in eliminating all guns except for the military and
<BR>
police.
<BR>
<P>That includes yours.
<BR>
<P>Todays AWAD also applies to you:
<BR>
<P>palilogy (puh-LIL-uh-jee) noun
<BR>
<P>The technique of repeating a word or phrase for emphasis. Also,
<BR>
palillogy.
<BR>
<P>[From Greek palillogia recapitulation, equivalent to palin again,
<BR>
back + -logia -logy.] 
<BR>
<P>&quot;What Highet calls a tricolon we may today call a palilogy, the
<BR>
deliberate repetition of words and grammatical presentations, a
<BR>
sort of parallelism in threes.&quot;
