<EM>&gt; &gt; The only realistic way how to get at that initial set of data is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; either growing it with an evolutionary algorithm (here the exact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nature of the computational engine is less crucial) or scanning a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; critter. In latter case you'll have to write a very very precise yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; high-performance neuronal emulation engine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Or you could start with humans and continuously augment (voluntarily)
<BR>
with first external but more and more integrated and then internal
<BR>
hardware and software.  This seems to me the best way to keep humans in
<BR>
the loop and to end up with something human compatible and reasonably
<BR>
likely to be friendly and caring about humanity.  
<BR>
<P>And this is inline with the main track of human augmenting computer
<BR>
work.  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Exactly right, and as a consequence, no one is going to write that neuronal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emulation engine when the alternative (growing an initial set of data with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming) obviously surpasses manually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coding an AI.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Starting with that net and concept formation skills and building up that
<BR>
and surpassing it should also work. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure why many apparently smart people still want to do it the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Cyc way. Codify everything explicitly, using an army of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; programmers, until the thing can limp off on its own. I just don't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it work, because even groups of people are just not smart enough for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Precisely so... What the Cyc way ends up with is a vast (but manageable) data
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; base that does what its namesake implies: It renders encyclopedic knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like the human caricature of a &quot;walking encyclopedia&quot; it is full of facts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information, but it can't do any real or original thinking. If Cyc passes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Turing test, it does so as a result of the incompetence of human interviewers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not because of Cyc's artificial thought processes. IOW, just because Cyc has all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the answers, that doesn't mean it can formulate an intelligent question.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>But what a great resources to hook into the WebMind or to have at the
<BR>
disposal of more capable AI!  Don't throw that work out.  It is a useful
<BR>
piece.  If nothing else it is a huge glob of training material.
