Friends,
<BR>
<P>Name of the game is Effing Quale. (Well, maybe not, but I love the phrase.)
<BR>
<P>Awaken to &gt;H. Then LE, then cryo, then bio, then upgrades, then self rep,
<BR>
then ai, then off planet locally, then nano, then augmentation, then si,
<BR>
then uploads, then off to deep space in search of the wherewithal to
<BR>
transcend. 
<BR>
<P>Find transhumanism.  Find your fellow transhumanists.  Forge the bond.
<BR>
Work to develop the tech.  Race against time to get it before you die,
<BR>
and/or work on a scheme to get to the future (cryo) while preserving your
<BR>
competitive resources (your surviving transhumanist pals may be of
<BR>
assistance here, so you socially challenged,
<BR>
I-want-the-Jupiter-brain-all-to-myself-geek-boys might just want to
<BR>
consider working on your geniality a tad) .  Fight the luddites for your
<BR>
right to the tech.  Fight the govt for your right to freedom.  Fight the
<BR>
ruthless and mighty corporate competitors (or join them is that feels like
<BR>
a winning strategy) for your place in the race.  Dodge/survive biowar,
<BR>
nanowar, old paradigm revanchists, rogue ai/si, ill-chosen strategies of
<BR>
self-enhancement, and finally, the siren perils of the galactic vastness.
<BR>
Onward! 
<BR>
<P>In an ordinary game when you lose, you--the game character-- very often
<BR>
die.  Then you --the game player--go to a saved version of the game--if you
<BR>
were mindful to make one--and resume play.  In this game, the same
<BR>
functionality would be required of course, but your &quot;return&quot; to the game
<BR>
could be &quot;explained&quot; as the consequence of having &gt;H &quot;life insurance--saved
<BR>
backups of yourself.  If the game consists partly in learning what a
<BR>
transhuman is, how to think like one, and how to act like one, then early
<BR>
on in the game you discover there is no &quot;save game&quot; functionality.  In its
<BR>
place you must learn to equip yourself with a synaptic inventory-and-state
<BR>
recorder /transmitter--a &gt;H &quot;flight data recorder&quot;(&gt;Hfdr)--which records
<BR>
and broadcasts updates of your vital identity data to a remote secure data
<BR>
haven.  In the event of lethal misadventure that you see coming, there's a
<BR>
final burst transmission which gives you, upon &quot;reboot&quot; into your
<BR>
reinstantiated self, a high definition replay--complete with optional
<BR>
true-fidelity physical discomfort metric--of your most recent terminal
<BR>
screw-up.  If on the other hand, you get terminated so abruptly that the
<BR>
data record is truncated, then you might have to make do with your most
<BR>
recent data update.  If it were particularly important to your future
<BR>
success that you have a detailed record, then you might upgrade yourself
<BR>
with a whoopass robust &gt;Hfdr,  go back to the scene of your last
<BR>
deanimation, and sift through the debris for your last &quot;flight data
<BR>
recorder&quot;.  Or, you could just send a remote.  Naaah.  You got backups, use
<BR>
'em.  Toss another shrimp on the barby, *be* the shrimp.  Onward!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P><P>at your  would be polled for the &quot;most recent data&quot;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
