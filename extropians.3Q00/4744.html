<EM>&gt; I'm a Nader Extropian. Since all the major candidates have such strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-Extropian positions, I'm for Ralph. His stance for legalizing Pot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and most other drugs, Gay Marriage liberatarianism, Environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protection, and ending corporate wealfare. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Not just no, but *HELL* no.  Nader has an absolutely vile agenda.  It
<BR>
boggles the mind that you could consider almost total regulation of the
<BR>
economy to be even vaguely extropic.  And I find his concept of
<BR>
&quot;diversity&quot; (which looks suspiciously like government mandated conformity
<BR>
i.e. the legal exclusion of any lifestyles or life choices he doesn't like)
<BR>
to be absolutely sickening.  The Ralph Nader platform reads like what
<BR>
every socialist uber-paradise was *supposed* to be (not that he would be
<BR>
any more successful).  Hardcore socialism through and through.  With Nader
<BR>
you can throw things like &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; out the window. 
<BR>
Who is going to fund your technology venture when he puts a $200k/yr cap
<BR>
on income? The government?  Things would only happen if the government
<BR>
decided that it was good for you and good for the government.
<BR>
<P>If the only things I lose by not voting for Nader are legalized pot,
<BR>
environmental &quot;protection&quot; (arguable), and few other issues that the
<BR>
government shouldn't be involved in in the first place, I find that very
<BR>
acceptable in exchange for not utterly destroying progress as we know it.
<BR>
<P>So what exactly *is* a &quot;Nader Extropian&quot;?
