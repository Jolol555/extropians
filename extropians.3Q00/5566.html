<EM> &gt; Oh, why bother.  I really am starting to get a bit frustrated over here.  I've
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; been talking about this for weeks and it doesn't seem to have any effect
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; whatsoever.  Nobody is even bothering to distinguish between subgoals and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; supergoals.  You're all just playing with words.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahem. Pot calling the kettle black.
<BR>
<P>The reason we can't connect is, well, because you seem to be just
<BR>
playing with words. There are serious objections to the way you want
<BR>
to build the thing and what the thing is supposed to do which can only 
<BR>
be resolved by showing evidence.
<BR>
<P>Maybe it is really time to fire up the text editor to begin with the
<BR>
architecture outline. Look at packages which adaptively rewrite parts
<BR>
of their source (maybe James Rogers will part with some of his
<BR>
proprietary magick), at the way they do it, and on their
<BR>
limitations. Because the system will have to be distributed, and hence
<BR>
portable, it is probably a good idea to use Java. Latest compilers
<BR>
seem to have reduced the performace gap to just a factor of 2-3. You
<BR>
might want put it up at SourceForge, or keep it closed source,
<BR>
whatever makes more sense.
<BR>
<P>But whatever you do, your ASCII should come as specs and source, not
<BR>
posts, if you want to convince us.
<BR>
<P>And nothing convinces like a killer demo.
