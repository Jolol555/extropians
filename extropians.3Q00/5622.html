writes:  &lt;&lt; There are some practical dangers in brandishing a weapon without 
<BR>
being prepared to use it, but I suspect that Tom is right, and most of the 
<BR>
time this would be an effective strategy. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young man I worked my way through engineering partially by carry a 
<BR>
.38 and investigating burgular alarms that were sounding off.  There is 
<BR>
something I sense you are overlooking.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many criminals that will attempt to take your weapon if they do 
<BR>
not believe you will use it.  The weapon is worth a fair amount of money on 
<BR>
the street and the macho value of having taken it from you is also rather 
<BR>
high.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also criminals that will attack you if you if you pull a gun 
<BR>
because they simply do not believe you will shoot them.  For that reason I 
<BR>
also carried a nightstick because those same idiots always seemed to believe 
<BR>
I would brain them.  In my view carrying the stick was a small price to pay 
<BR>
if it bought me peace while I was doing my job.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary what I am saying is that if you decide to carry a gun, as you 
<BR>
have a right to do, then think it all through ahead of time; otherwise you 
<BR>
could either get badly hurt or be pushed into doing something you would be 
<BR>
unwilling to do after reflection.
