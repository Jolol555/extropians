<P><EM>&gt; All in all a rather strange article, mundane in places with a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  bizarre sections to keep us on our toes.  Perhaps the dual authorship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  is showing here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not dual authorship, but dual culture.  The passages you found notably odd, 
<BR>
Hal, arise from having one foot in the past and one in the future.  You say 
<BR>
you can't see why anyone would object to an adult choosing to alter their 
<BR>
genome for purely decorative purposes.  I agree - I can't understand why 
<BR>
anyone would object, either.  But LOTS of people would - probably the 
<BR>
majority of people able to grasp the basic concept.  
<BR>
<P>Most of the human animal's period on Earth - and an even larger portion of 
<BR>
its duration if you count our immediate biological ancestors - was lived in 
<BR>
an environment in which humans had no control over biology.  Instead, biology 
<BR>
completely controlled humans.  Ten thousand years ago, we began to work with 
<BR>
selective breeding as a technology to gain some slow mastery over some 
<BR>
aspects of biology; a technology that produced results only over a period of 
<BR>
decades to millennia.  Evolutionary psychology is giving us insights into the 
<BR>
fact that we have only begun to come to terms with this technology in terms 
<BR>
of our psychology and culture.
<BR>
<P>In the blink of an eye, we have stepped across a new threshold.  The cultural 
<BR>
and psychological tools we have to deal with the power of genengineering are 
<BR>
only a couple of centuries old, dating really only from the 18th century 
<BR>
Enlightenment; again, the blink of an eye in terms of the speed with which 
<BR>
most of human culture changed.
<BR>
<P>It shouldn't surprise us that the people who are having to come to terms with 
<BR>
the new power of genengineering are ill-equipped to deal with it, in terms of 
<BR>
psychology, philosophy and culture.  Yesterday we were neolithic 
<BR>
hunter-gatherers.  At dawn we developed agriculture.  A few minutes later, we 
<BR>
invented writing.  It's not even breakfast time yet, and we have to deal with 
<BR>
controlling the human genome.  Most of humanity is barely awake.
