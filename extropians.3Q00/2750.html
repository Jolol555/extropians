<BR>
<EM>&gt; I just wanted to let you know that the story will be out in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; September issue, and it's a pretty amazing exposé of how a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Net-powered pyramid scheme -- apparently run by a mysterious Russian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fugitive through offshore servers in Dominica -- attracted nearly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 275,000 players worldwide. The person whose message on this list 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; originally caught my eye -- Rick Potvin -- is now convinced that SG 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a scam, too.
</EM><BR>
<P>I followed some of those Ponzi schemes for a few months early this year
<BR>
after they were described here.  StockGeneration did crash around March
<BR>
or April, devaluing everyone's &quot;stock&quot; but then trying once again to
<BR>
drum up business for people to get in and take advantage of the new low,
<BR>
low prices.  Other schemes with names like DigitalStocks and EMutualFun
<BR>
have stepped in to offer alternatives.
<BR>
<P>The basic idea of all of these is you buy a &quot;virtual stock&quot; (for real
<BR>
money) which is more or less guaranteed to go up in value.  The way
<BR>
they achieve this is by using the money from later investors to pay off
<BR>
those who want to withdraw early.  They hope that most people will be
<BR>
satisfied with paper profits and stay in the game long enough to bring
<BR>
in more suckers by telling tales of riches.
<BR>
<P>That's the really sad part of all of this; there is a multi-level
<BR>
marketing angle by which you bring people into the game via referrals,
<BR>
and get bonuses as a result.  Plus, most investors realize that the only
<BR>
hope they have of seeing real money is if they can get more people to
<BR>
come in.  So the players find themselves essentially forced to become
<BR>
hucksters for the games.  Even if they come to realize that the games
<BR>
are essentially fraudulent, the only hope they have to get their money
<BR>
out is to suck in more people.
<BR>
<P>There were a number of sad posts on the Delphi message boards where the
<BR>
players congregate in which people turned against the games and admitted
<BR>
that their previous postings, full of glowing hucksterism, were fraudulent
<BR>
and only motivated to try to raise interest in the games.  In some cases
<BR>
players admitted to having misled potential investors with stories of
<BR>
how much money they had made and successfully withdrawn from the game.
<BR>
Once they realized that no amount of promotion was going to work, they
<BR>
gave up and came clean.
<BR>
<P>I was especially disappointed by the posts here by Frederick Mann,
<BR>
a well known &quot;freedom entrepreneur&quot;.  By promoting these Ponzi schemes
<BR>
(especially on his bigbooster.com web site) he is essentially enriching
<BR>
himself at the cost of those he suckers in to feed his downline.  Even as
<BR>
one game after another collapses, he continues to try to draw people in.
<BR>
Presently he is promoting DigitalStocks, as StockGeneration has fallen
<BR>
off his radar, conveniently forgotten.  He has very little credibility
<BR>
in my book.
