<P><EM>&gt; One of the great things about libertarianism is consent. I don't care if YOU
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to live in a repressive communal society, so long as you don't force ME to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do the same, or if I want to try it out, you can't force me to stay if I change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my mind. The consent of the individual in all matters is its core ethic, and one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I think that extropy shares. Any philosophy that shares that ethic as well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can peacefully co-exist and co-operate with libertarians and a libertarian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society. If you can accept that, then you really should not have any trouble
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with extropy OR libertarianism. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You talk of your problems with implementation of libertarianism, but you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not stated what your problems are with such implementation. Do you think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people should be allowed to force others to do what they do not wish to do? Do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you mistakenly think that libertarians would initiate force to make others live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as libertarians wish to? Please explain....
</EM><BR>
<P>My problems are really three-fold here as to specifics.  #1:  I'v ebrought
<BR>
up the environmental issue before.  Group A may wish to simply be left alone, 
<BR>
but they're deforesting a hillside above Group B's settlement, causing the 
<BR>
water to be fouled and increasing the damage of floods in the springtime.  To
<BR>
fix the flood problem, Group B builds a dam to moderate flooding - but now
<BR>
Group C isn't getting enough water.  How do you resolve this in a libertarian
<BR>
fashion, if negotiation fails?
<BR>
<P>#2:  Not everyone will play by the &quot;non-coercive&quot; rule.  Simply look at how
<BR>
powerful a memetic structure religion is.  I would love to be left alone - but
<BR>
a group of people reading one of a handful of passages from Leviticus suddenly 
<BR>
gets this idea that I am less deserving to live than they are.  One of the 
<BR>
tradeoffs in modern western political systems is that this sort of activity is
<BR>
mostly curtailed.
<BR>
<P>#3:  Markets are wonderful, btu I doubt withotu a regulatory regime that they
<BR>
would be as resistant to fraud and manipulation as they are now.  Market-based
<BR>
systems work, but I don't know if I could trust a mechanism that operates
<BR>
on the honor system to play such a vital role in my life
<BR>
<P>The other issue here is the ability of a libertarian society or culture to 
<BR>
resist the influence of a better organized, more coercive society.  My concern
<BR>
is less the libertarian society acting in a physically coercive way (One could
<BR>
argue abot memetic coercion, such as a proselytizing meme, but I don't know
<BR>
how that fits into a libertarian view) but more a non-libertarian society
<BR>
acting in a coercive manne rtowards the libertarian one.  The closest thing 
<BR>
we have to a guattantor that this won't happen is the presence of nuclear
<BR>
devices, and to a lesser extent the ability to locate in a place beyond 
<BR>
traditional borders and geographic pressures (i.e. space)
