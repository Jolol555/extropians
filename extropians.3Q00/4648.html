[As happens in more than 99% of all civil cases, the one I was taking to 
<BR>
trial last week settled - unlike most, though, at the last minute.  So, I'm 
<BR>
playing catch-up.]

<EM>&gt;  &gt; Paul, please tell me how I can make this true for my clients.  Many (but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; all) of my clients are these &quot;big corporations&quot; you've been talking 
</EM><BR>
about.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; My client in the trial I'm starting on Wednesday would certainly 
</EM><BR>
qualify.  
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; suppose I've been wasting all the work I've done over this holdiay 
</EM><BR>
weekend,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; since our victory is assured .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Assured?  Never once said it was assured.  However, when you take into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  case law throughout the 20th century, I'd be very surprised to learn that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  larger and more well financed legal team is not the victor in the majority 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cases - *especially if the corporation is the plaintiff.*   The most 
</EM><BR>
obvious
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  exceptions are ones involving corporations as defendants in liability 
</EM><BR>
cases. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  those cases the potential payoff to the plaintiff lawyers could be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substantial,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  thereby increasing the chances of the little guy gaining the support of an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sizable legal team.   Sounds to me like you are representing the 
</EM><BR>
corporation 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  defendant in this case, yes?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes - right on the latter count, and right in large part on the former.  As 
<BR>
I've commented before, one of the things my increasingly libertarian 
<BR>
political philosophy has done is transform me from an opponent of contingency 
<BR>
fees to a proponent of them, precisely as a protection for &quot;the little guy&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [snip] . . . what your missing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  when the tables are turned, and the corporation is the plaintiff.  What 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chances
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  does the little guy have then?  Unless that person is also an 800lb 
</EM><BR>
gorilla, 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the lawsuit is clearly frivolous, that little guy will have no choice but 
</EM><BR>
to 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in fear of an expensive lawsuit they cannot afford, or get lucky enough to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the support of an expensive legal team due to any potential landmark 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; precedents it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  might set.  The most recent and poignant case is Eric Corley of 2600 who is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  getting the support of the EFF because of its landmark implications on the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; First
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Amendment.  I can tell you right now, if it wasn't for the support of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EFF,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Eric Corley would be probably br history regardless of the intrinsic 
</EM><BR>
justice 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the case.  And that is the injustice of the system - those who can't 
</EM><BR>
afford 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  money for a defense against a corporate plaintiff have little chance at 
</EM><BR>
all.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Overwhelmingly when an individual citizen or smaller organization or 
</EM><BR>
company
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  receives a cease and desist letter, they are going to comply regardless of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  might be legal or just, simply because they cannot afford emotionally or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  financially the alternative.  So where is the justice in that?
</EM><BR>
<P>There isn't, which is why support for &quot;public interest law firms&quot; is so 
<BR>
important.  Pioneered by Thurgood Marshall's NAACP &quot;Inc. Fund&quot; group and 
<BR>
carried on by the ACLU, there are dozens of such entities.  Check out this 
<BR>
directory:

Center:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.splcenter.org/">http://www.splcenter.org/</A>

<P>regarding the SPLC's victory last week over the Aryan Nation.
<BR>
<P>As part of a vital justice system that is truly bound by the rule of law and 
<BR>
which protects the rights of individuals, such institutions are at least as 
<BR>
important as an independent judiciary.  Are public interest law firms a 
<BR>
panacea to the problem you identify, Paul?  No, almost certainly not.  At 
<BR>
least as important is general civic education that gives people the knowledge 
<BR>
that just receiving a cease-and-desist letter isn't the end of the game.  
<BR>
Unfortunately, the presence of a &quot;nanny state&quot; tends to lull people into 
<BR>
complacency about their legal rights, with the refrain that &quot;there ought to 
<BR>
be a law&quot; really meaning that &quot;my interest should be preferred by the state&quot;.
