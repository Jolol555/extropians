<P><EM>&gt; I'm always stunned to find that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; financial planning, basic logic, and evolutionary

<EM>&gt; theory, are almost never taught in schools, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least based on the many hundreds of students 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have surveyed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree wholeheartedly Max. Especially about logic and
<BR>
critical thinking not being systematically offered in
<BR>
the public school systems. I have asked many
<BR>
administrators why this is so and they simply shrug
<BR>
their shoulders.
<BR>
<P>As a school psychologist, most of the children I work
<BR>
with are referred to me because they are considered to
<BR>
be &quot;behavior problems&quot;. I've found that many of them
<BR>
are having difficulties for the same reason that many
<BR>
adults have difficulties.  They are making poor
<BR>
decisions.  They're making poor decisions because they
<BR>
have weak reasoning skills, because they repeatedly
<BR>
employ logical fallacies, because they have distorted
<BR>
perceptions of themselves or others, becaause they
<BR>
lack training in logic and critical thinking skills.
<BR>
<P>I'm currently consulting for the Science Education
<BR>
Department of a State University who is working with
<BR>
NASA on various projects designed to help pre-service
<BR>
teachers develop more effective instructional
<BR>
strategies in the sciences.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://education.nasa.gov/nova/">http://education.nasa.gov/nova/</A>
<BR>
<P>During the latest workshop, one professor informed me
<BR>
that he had given the Myers-Briggs to about 250
<BR>
pre-service teachers and 70% of those assessed were
<BR>
identified as &quot;Guardians&quot;.  This is purported to be a
<BR>
personality temperament that tends to be enculturating
<BR>
as parents, helpmates as spouses, and conformity
<BR>
oriented. There are at least 40 percent and as many as
<BR>
45 percent of the general population. These are the
<BR>
security-seeking personalities, the keepers of the
<BR>
status quo. They give little more than lip-service to
<BR>
the idea that students should critically examine
<BR>
everything for fear that their own teaching styles
<BR>
might come under scrutiny. This would be incongruent
<BR>
with a security-seeking personality.
<BR>
<P>So these appear to be the people who are
<BR>
self-selecting to be the ones who indoctrinate our
<BR>
children. I suspect that many well-reasoned efforts at
<BR>
educational reform have been undermined by the
<BR>
excessive number of teachers in the system that are
<BR>
simply predisposed to resist change. Perhaps
<BR>
universities need to consider recruiting individuals
<BR>
who will be more amenable to the more effective
<BR>
teaching styles that have been developed.
