<P>From: Roland Baddeley &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rjb@biols.susx.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20This%20looks%20like%20a%20fun%20way%20to%20spend%203%20years...&In-Reply-To=&lt;4.2.2.20000806041818.00af3850@cassius.its.unimelb.edu.au&gt;">rjb@biols.susx.ac.uk</A>&gt;
<BR>
Three year postdoctoral position funded by the BBSRC to work on the
<BR>
computational analysis of visual signalling in cuttlefish, to work in
<BR>
collaboration with Dr Daniel Osorio and Dr Roland Baddeley at Sussex
<BR>
University.
<BR>
<P>Cuttlefish have a remarkable ability to change their skin coloration
<BR>
patterns giving them amazing camouflage abilities, and a very
<BR>
effective visual communication channel. Previous work on cuttlefish
<BR>
has relied on qualitative classification of their body patterns, but
<BR>
by using digital video cameras, image warping techniques, and
<BR>
statistical pattern analysis, it is now possible to quantitatively
<BR>
analyze these changing skin patterns. Doing this we hope to understand
<BR>
their role in camouflage and communication. We are therefore looking
<BR>
for a postdoctoral researcher (for up to 3 years) who will:
<BR>
<P>1. Analyze the skin patterns generated by the cuttlefish. We have
<BR>
developed warping and independent components analysis software. The
<BR>
researcher would be expected implement additional means of analysis
<BR>
that would shed light on the dimensionality, any clustering of the
<BR>
patterns (expected), and implement methods to study the dynamics of
<BR>
the change.
<BR>
<P>2. Conduct experiments on camouflage. The animals are kept in tanks
<BR>
where ``textures'' can be inserted underneath. We can therefore
<BR>
analyze camouflage by quantifying how the cuttlefish maps the texture
<BR>
pattern inserted, onto its skin patterns. This will give unprecedented
<BR>
insight into texture and form perception by a non-human animal. As
<BR>
well as conducting the experiments, the researcher would be expected
<BR>
to maintain the animals. No previous experience is required as
<BR>
training will be provided.
<BR>
<P>3. Conduct experiments on communication. The cuttlefish communicate by
<BR>
generating stereotypical patterns on the skin. As well as analyzing
<BR>
these patterns on their own, given a quantitative description, the
<BR>
relationship between the patterns of two communicating animals can be
<BR>
analyzed (information capacity, relationship to behavior). Again the
<BR>
researcher would be expected to collect data and analyze the results.
<BR>
Applicants should have a strong background in statistical/neural
<BR>
network techniques and an interest in applying them to real world
<BR>
problems. The candidates will be experience in programming (MATLAB
<BR>
preferred) and mathematical analysis.
<BR>
<P>Enquiries are welcome and can be made to Daniel Osorio
<BR>

<BR>
The salary will be on the standard BBSRC scale starting from 19,428
<BR>
p.a. plus benefits.
<BR>
<P>Applicants for this position should submit C.V., relevant reprints,
<BR>
and 3 letters of references. Letters of recommendation can be sent
<BR>
electronically (plain text, word, or PDF) to <A HREF="mailto:rjb@biols.susx.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20This%20looks%20like%20a%20fun%20way%20to%20spend%203%20years...&In-Reply-To=&lt;4.2.2.20000806041818.00af3850@cassius.its.unimelb.edu.au&gt;">rjb@biols.susx.ac.uk</A>
<BR>
Applications can also be sent by mail to: Roland Baddeley, Laboratory
<BR>
of Experimental Psychology, Sussex University, Falmer, Brighton
