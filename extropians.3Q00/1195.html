<EM>&gt; &gt;I agree. However, that process of learning and incemental improvement will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;almost certainly take several decades if it is done using extensions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;current techniques. That makes the resulting brain simulation a 2030 -
</EM><BR>
2050
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;era technology, vs 2010 - 2030 for basic nanotech manufacturing, sensing
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;computing devices.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While it can see how it might take some time to learn how local things
</EM><BR>
work,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I think it takes much less time to compile that more abstractly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would you think that?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  And since I tend to think of nanotech as more of a gradual increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturing abilities, I don't think specifics of nanotech progress matter
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; that much here.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nanotech also offers qualitiatively new abilities that can significantly
<BR>
affect the development of other technologies. Without nanotech you aren't
<BR>
going to see cheap uploads in this century - the computers will be too slow,
<BR>
and it will take too long to do the optimization research.
<BR>
<P>But with nanotech, you can have neural interfaces and limited IE before you
<BR>
can do an upload, based  on partial understanding of particular portions of
<BR>
the brain. You can build cheap computers that have the power to run uploads,
<BR>
but those same machines are availible for AI research. The relative rates of
<BR>
progress of these different technologies all change significantly, which gives
<BR>
you a very different world when it comes time to predict what will happen when
<BR>
those first uploads happen. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think neural interfaces will be very useful,
</EM><BR>
<P>Neural interfaces would make truly immersive VR and ER environments possible,
<BR>
which would in turn lead to the appearance of large new markets for virtual
<BR>
goods and services. The hard distinction between things that are &quot;inside a
<BR>
computer&quot; and &quot;outside here in the 'real' world&quot; would vanish, leaving society
<BR>
much more willing to acknowledge that someone who lives inside a computer
<BR>
might be a real person. And, of course, the fact that an upload has no
<BR>
physical body would no longer constitute a significant limit on its ability to
<BR>
interact with normal humans.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and don't think substantial intelligence enhancement is that relevant -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever enhancements humans have uploads can use too.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we should expect that uploads will be able to use most enhancements that
<BR>
would work on humans. But that doesn't mean IE doesn't matter. What it implies
<BR>
is that, as IE and related technology advances, the difference between an
<BR>
upload and a 'normal' human dwindles to insignificance. If IE gets going
<BR>
relatively quickly, and uploading takes longer, it is entirely possible that
<BR>
uploads per se will never be an important factor.
<BR>
<P>To put it in concrete terms: Does an upload that does a hundred jobs at the
<BR>
same time, some virtual and some via teleoperated drones, have any particular
<BR>
competitive advantage over an enhanced 'human' who can do the same things? I
<BR>
would say, only if you don't have to pay the upload - and at that point it
<BR>
will be obvious to everyone that you are practicing slavery.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sentient AI seems very unlikely to me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen before uploads, being a vastly harder problem.
</EM><BR>
<P>On what basis do you assume that it is 'vastly harder'? I have considerable
<BR>
respect for the difficulty of duplicating the human mind in software, but you
<BR>
don't have to do that to make significant breakthoughts in AI.
<BR>
<P>Acheiving animal-level intelligence seems to be a much more tractible problem,
<BR>
and it would enable us to build robots good enough to automate almost all
<BR>
physical labor. Building specialized programs capable of superhuman
<BR>
performance on narrow problems is obviously feasible, and seems likely to
<BR>
become increasingly common in the near future. But these kinds of advances
<BR>
would significantly affect the usefullness of upload slavery (since humans
<BR>
would primarily be usefull for general-purpose decision making, and you can't
<BR>
trust a slave to do that for you), and would have many of the
<BR>
wealth-multiplying effects that pie-in-the-sky types usually atribute to
<BR>
nanotechnology.
<BR>
<P>---------
<BR>
<P>Having written all that, I have two general observations to make about your
<BR>
particular upload scenarios:
<BR>
<P>1) Slave labor is generally not profitable, because of the size of the
<BR>
investment required to ensure that the slaves don't revolt (and, more
<BR>
generally, that they actually obey your orders instead of just doing what they
<BR>
want to do). I don't see anything about upload slavery that would make it
<BR>
immune to this problem - unless you want to posit effective mind control
<BR>
technology, in which case it is fairly obvious that the mind controllers will
<BR>
end up either dead or in control of the entire economy.
<BR>
<P>2) Creating an upload doesn't just increase the labor supply. It also
<BR>
increases demand, since the upload will want to spend his wages on something.
<BR>
Upload copying is thus exactly analogous to ordinary population growth - it is
<BR>
just a faster, potentially less costly way of doing the same thing. Now, it is
<BR>
obvious that ordinary population growth hasn't driven wages down or led us to
<BR>
enslave unpopular segments of the population, so why should the situation with
<BR>
uploads be any different?
