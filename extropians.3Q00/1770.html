<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I've given up trying to get those games to run under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; win 9x
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (actually I use NT, which makes possibilities really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; remote).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
&lt;Ziana&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, maybe you could create a seperate partition (DOS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't like NTFS) and install DOS on it (party!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; party!), and then dual-boot into it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
&lt;Mike Lorrey&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; My recommendation based on my own experience is to create a DOS boot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disk with the CDROM drivers on it, and boot from the floppy and run the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game off the CD. This leaves your resources available for the game.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>What I used to do was to set up elaborate boot menus in DOS 6+, to allow me
<BR>
to boot into big ems setups, or no ems setups, or whatever, and then
<BR>
autostart a given game; I had a bunch of batch scripts to generate
<BR>
autoexec.bat and config.dat files, where I could specify code to start the
<BR>
game (usually a batch file name), and which of my standard memory configs I
<BR>
wanted to use for that game. The generated files would implement a set of
<BR>
custom boot menus to do the job rather nicely.
<BR>
<P>What I'd like to do now is to do the same kind of thing, as a seperate
<BR>
bootable OS on an NT machine, then have dos choosable from the NT boot
<BR>
loader in the usual way; no 'orrible boot floppies. I think my old batch
<BR>
files still exist, on a 100mb harddrive in my brother's computer (he lives
<BR>
interstate), which is not connected up (just sits there dumbly inside the
<BR>
box). His other HD is a couple of gig, so we never bothered to hook up the
<BR>
littlun, thus my hope that my old files live on in the computer form of
<BR>
cryo.
<BR>
<P>Of course, I'll do no such thing. Not only would it take ages, but I really,
<BR>
really can't afford to have dedicated games machines sitting around,
<BR>
beckoning!
<BR>
<P><PRE>
----
<P>All this multiple OS stuff is getting to me; I've recently come to have a
need to run Linux, which means I've probably got to upgrade my (sorry, my
wife's) desktop machine &amp; dual boot it between NT &amp; Linux, or get another
machine just for that purpose; my notebook has room, but after the fight I
had to install NT &amp; 95 on it in a stable configuration, I'll be damned if I
go upsetting things trying to get Linux to multi-boot &amp; support obscure
hardware. I can't have a CDROM &amp; floppy disk drive connected simultaneously;
I doubt I could even shoehorn Linux in at all.
<P>Then I've got to bite the bullet and put a network in (my machines are
currently totally seperate). It's a world of pain.
<P>Is it just me, or is this kind of system setup stuff a true nightmare for
everyone (well, except Harvey)?
