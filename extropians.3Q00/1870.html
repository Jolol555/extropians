<EM>&gt;ROBERT BRADBURY SAID: &quot;...There is no clear way of knowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if lifespan decreasing genes are defective variants of lifespan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;extending genes...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;CYMM SAYS: In fact they may not be defects at all... but simply genes that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are selected for - or not selected against - under a harsh regime... like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the archtypal sickle cell gene.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The apo polymorphisms might be placed here...as might be the various genes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for type II diabetes; that gene variant... damn I forgot ...for platelet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aggregability; and of course the Mt5178 complex.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
You know, there is a wealth of literature  - the Bible, the tale of 
<BR>
Gilgamesh, the Shah Nama, etc., which describes individuals living for 
<BR>
centuries, followed by a slowly declining lifespan leveling out where we are 
<BR>
now.  Of course, it is possible and even likely that this is just mythology. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not likely enough to totally discount...
<BR>
<P>Considering that native intelligence X accumulated knowledge X informational 
<BR>
technology expertise provide for an exponential advantage to long-lived 
<BR>
individuals, it seems possible that a period in human history could actually 
<BR>
have produced some very long lived genotypes.
<BR>
<P>In such really primitive societies as we have good information on, such as 
<BR>
the paradigm New Hebrides tribes, it is typical for those males that do 
<BR>
survive to their 50's or 60's to dominate the local gene pool, with access 
<BR>
to several generations of multiple wives over their lifespan, while the 
<BR>
non-Alpha males rarely reproduce at all.  This again would give a tremendous 
<BR>
genetic advantage to an exceptionally long life.
<BR>
<P>The New Hebrides tribes have their genetic roots in an apparent shipwreck 
<BR>
about 2000 years ago.  Today, many of them are clearly differentiated by 
<BR>
physiologically distinct traits.  There is a tribe of near pigmies, for 
<BR>
example, as well as a tribe of near giants - in only 2000 years!  This 
<BR>
should not be so surprising, however, considering the variations in dog 
<BR>
species over a similar period.
<BR>
<P>What would have happened to genes for a lifespan of hundreds of years, 
<BR>
assuming that the tales have a root in truth?  I suspect that a culture 
<BR>
dominated by such people would have quickly, due to the inherent 
<BR>
informational advantages, dominated the human scene, both genetically and 
<BR>
otherwise.  Like many of the early human cities, however, they would 
<BR>
ultimately have been devastated by encountering a plague to which, because 
<BR>
of their common genetic heritage, they would have been particularly 
<BR>
vulnerable.
<BR>
<P>This factor is what kept the New Hebrides tribes from ever uniting or any 
<BR>
one tribe from dominating, or, for that matter, from ever reaching a 
<BR>
Malthusian population problem.  According to McNeal (sp?) in his Plagues and 
<BR>
Peoples, there is a natural limit - I believe he put it at about 500 - to 
<BR>
the sustainable size of primitive human contiguous populations, because of 
<BR>
the disease factor.  Those tribes that did develop some technological or 
<BR>
genetic advantage that enabled them to grow beyond that limit would 
<BR>
inevitably succumb shortly thereafter to a plague of some kind.
<BR>
<P>It was apparently only the lifting of the last ice age and the migration 
<BR>
northward into relatively sterile and safe environments - i.e., N. Europe - 
<BR>
that allowed for the development of permanent sustainable cities that did 
<BR>
not get periodically devastated.  This also roughly coincides with the 
<BR>
emergence of the epics citing the long-lived heros.  And the immunity from 
<BR>
plagues of the Northern cities was neither absolute nor permanent, although 
<BR>
it did give humanity a major leg up in the development of sustainable 
<BR>
civilization.
