&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....ART IS NOT PAINTINGS
<BR>
<P>Non-tolerance vs. too much tolerance. YEAH yeah yeah ..YahdeYADA - either way 
<BR>
one man can't be in control of defining the large mechanism that is &quot;art&quot;..  
<BR>
I ask: why does one need to be self proclaimed Hottentot of that is which is 
<BR>
not one's arena?
<BR>
Get busy. Marvel at the running river that is freedom of expression. Pull it 
<BR>
into you like air and breath deeply, drink deeply... my watch IS a piece of 
<BR>
art, trust me on that.
<BR>
<P>!!! This thread annoys me because it falls into the trap of minding other 
<BR>
people's art, initiating attacks, and issuing proclamations. Someone sent 
<BR>
some interesting &quot;other&quot; stuff to the list, Coolio! 
<BR>
<P>Pshaw. Defining &quot;what is&quot; art. Yucko. That is nonproductive. At the very 
<BR>
least, there are so many better qualified people that I'd ask. 
<BR>
<P>Have fun with it, make fun of it. Wear it lightly, like a gown you can take 
<BR>
off and throw aside.
<BR>
<P>Defining art within known boundaries is uninteresting and rigid. 
<BR>
<P>Instead of being rigid and uninteresting, play in fields of color and form 
<BR>
and unity -- delight yourself with intricacies. Blow your own mind. Be 
<BR>
fruitful and sensuous. Eat of new mediums until you gorge yourself on images, 
<BR>
sound, senses and tonality. Taste the bitter beingness that other people 
<BR>
present you. Massage ideas into your temples and lay back and look/listen 
<BR>
to/at the hierarchies and systems.
<BR>
<P>Enter. Do not Enter.
<BR>
<P><P>N
<BR>
<P>PS:
<BR>
If you are wondering what transhuman art is, get Natasha's book, it's that 
<BR>
simple!
