<P>&lt;&lt; Sure, I have no disagreement with that. I'm actively promoting it. But
<BR>
&nbsp;the problem is: can intelligence convert an open into a closed
<BR>
&nbsp;universe? Even if intelligence acts on the largest scales and has all
<BR>
&nbsp;available physical knowledge it may not be able to do such a thing. It
<BR>
&nbsp;may of course be that we will soon discover an easy trick of doing it
<BR>
&nbsp;(just involving 10^12 galaxy-masses of relativistic neutronium or
<BR>
&nbsp;something other easily obtainable :-). But you cannot build a very
<BR>
&nbsp;believable theory on the *possibility* that the laws we know are wrong
<BR>
&nbsp;(it would be like a theory that began &quot;Assume relativity doesn't
<BR>
&nbsp;hold...&quot;). That the laws of physics seem to evaporate in the presence
<BR>
&nbsp;of intelligence doesn't mean everything will become possible even for
<BR>
&nbsp;superbeings. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Well said, however the 'realm' of the universe exists where even hysterically 
<BR>
speaking, it just might ( 1 x 18 million chance) that the testing at Los 
<BR>
Alamos in New Mexico in July, 55 years ago might have ignited the entire 
<BR>
planetary oxygen on fire. Also, the fear last February, that the New Collider 
<BR>
at Brookhaven Labs would pierce the 'false vacuum' that outer space consists 
<BR>
of and the universe poop out. Playing an actuarial game, one may almost 
<BR>
conclude that given a universe where intelligence might persist into the 
<BR>
billions of years, a kind of convergence of capability to manipulate  even 
<BR>
phyiscal laws would 'naturally' occur.
<BR>
<P>&lt;OK, I would gladly settle for a neuron brain in the interrim, no
<BR>
question about it. But it is *so much simpler* than the Omega Point
<BR>
(we can at least imagine how a nanotech version of it might work
<BR>
according to known physics).&gt;
<BR>
<P>Precisely, but its good to remember that Tipler was playing a decent, mental 
<BR>
exercise on how things could happen, not an absolute guarantee that they 
<BR>
would, or that it axiomatically has to happen in this way. Tipler is speaking 
<BR>
to the Eshaton, the absolute of absolutes. Or would the last intelligence in 
<BR>
the universe please turn off the lights? 
<BR>
<P>&lt;Well, it might be useful for a lot of pre-omega things (like
<BR>
colonising the stars, literally). But of course, Tipler was really
<BR>
talking about interacting modes of the Higgs field for his
<BR>
OP-computer.&gt;
<BR>
<P>The Higgs feild research seems full of a kind of awe-inspiring content, 
<BR>
rather then some of the other papers that are to be obtained at the 
<BR>
LANL-Archives under High Energy Physics-Phenominology (a website I see you 
<BR>
have visited frequently!) Pre-Omega things are teriffic, and the descendents 
<BR>
(ascendents of ours) will likely fine-tune mattter/energy/info to suit their 
<BR>
needs--their may be several ways to the Eshaton-whatever the heck they/we 
<BR>
call it.
<BR>
<P>&lt;What would be suitable storage units? I have been thinking about
<BR>
vortex loops, they look nice and ought to be useful for something.&gt;
<BR>
<P>Hmmm. Sounds somehow, profound.
<BR>
<P>&lt;The problem is that it is accelerating due to the cosmological
<BR>
constant. The horizons are creeping closer and closer..&gt;
<BR>
<P>That is beyond my level of understanding.  If the horizons or boarders of the 
<BR>
universe are creeping closer, then it sounds like its a heat death colapse no 
<BR>
matter what?
<BR>
<P>&lt;Sure. I hope to be there (two ancient posthumans still debating
<BR>
cosmology - &quot;See? That cluster was not relativistic either! Told you
<BR>
so back in last eon!&quot; :-) )  &gt;
<BR>
<P>I am guessing that we will not be alone in this and that the ensamble of 
<BR>
universes in the  Max Tegmark sense, will supply entertainment and 
<BR>
stimulating conversations for
<BR>
Yotta-Epochs to come.
