no, there should be heavily color-driven, geometric games where
<BR>
average kinetic energy, and total capacity take stage center.  do the
<BR>
olympics have to be knocked over in order to reoptimize and place new
<BR>
games?  or are these games that we speak of already in place in
<BR>
industry-society?  the gay man won because he had the highest 'index
<BR>
of effectiveness' (see andromeda strain, again) :)

<EM>&gt; As we go into this Olympic season we are again reminded of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traditional nature of sports.  All the games have had the optimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strategies long since worked out, the athletes have honed all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same skills to within a hairs breadth of perfection, all the competitors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in each event look alike, all doing the same tricks, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Booooorrrrringggggg.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What we need now are new sports, where the optimal strategy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is still debatable.  Consider the Survivor game, which you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surely  heard about.  I didnt see any but the last half hour of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last show, but I understand there were three remaining players
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who participated in a challenge, the winner given the opportunity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to vote off one of the others.  The last three included an unpopular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man, a moderately popular woman and a very popular man.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There is a strange loop here, for the unpopular man must have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realized that the only possible way he could win the prize is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to lose the challenge!  Reasoning:  if he won the challenge, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he would face a vote by the last 7 contestants between himself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and either the moderately popular woman or the highly popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; man.  So, he lost the challenge, which was won by the woman,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who acted in her own best interest in voting off the popular man
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (to whom she would have lost in the final election) but in so doing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; she lost popularity with the jury of seven and so lost the final
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; election to the unpopular man!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now thats a cool strange-loop.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the spirit of survivor, I propose a new sport, the optimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strategy of which is unclear.  The game is to see who can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; walk (or run) the greatest distance, assuming that the competitor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must carry *all* necessary supplies, food, water, whatever else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be needed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To make the competition end in a reasonable time, we would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make the competition in Death Valley in the early fall, so its not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so very hot, but is very dry.  This means most of the payload
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be water.  Again to speed the competition, the walk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ends if the competitor stops for more than 5 minutes.  All the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitors get a GPS receiver connected to a phone.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that receiver gets the same number for 4.5 minutes, a warning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tone sounds, and if it hasnt changed 30 seconds later, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pickup crew is called.  This of course would preclude sleeping,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so the contest is unlikely to last more than about 30-40 hrs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the winners having traveled perhaps 150 km.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Under those conditions, men and women could compete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equally, for it is unclear what advantage, if any, accrues to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the biggest.  Also, there may be an advantage to the tall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skinny people, for they would cover more real estate with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each step, yet throw off access heat efficiently, thereby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making the best use of their water and food.  For this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason, it may be clear why I like this game.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anyone ideas or suggestions?  spike
