<P>Wow Emlyn thanks!  I didnt know there were those dirty THers

<P>Im back.  Ive even decided to cut down on the silliness, such
<BR>
as the above.  Went on vacation, had a great time.  My mailbox
<BR>
filled up after the first 3 days, so I missed out on the chatter from
<BR>
a week ago last Wednesday until last night.  {8-[
<BR>
<P>I shall get over it however.  {8-]  Soon as I fry those THers.

<P>What is a THer?  spike
