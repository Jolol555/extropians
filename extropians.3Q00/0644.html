<P><EM>&gt; An interesting post, which led me to consider an issue I've never seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussed in the literature (although this is doubtless due to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignorance): selective differentials from secular variations in sunlight,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperature etc and their impact on creatures with variant breeding and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mortality patterns.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suspect that the long term variations are effectively &quot;noise&quot; compared
<BR>
with short term variations driven by the chaos in the system.  The
<BR>
energy differentials from the sun are probably small compared with
<BR>
the local effects of tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, etc.
<BR>
<P>Energy input significantly effects breeding ability.  Environmental
<BR>
hazards are the determinants of the hazard function that drives the
<BR>
engineering of greater or lesser &quot;anti-aging&quot; genetic programs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If this has any bearing upon which phenotypes are best adapted at any given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slice across the cycles, I can imagine that critters which store food might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tend to live longer than those which don't;
</EM><BR>
<P>Rose's long-lived flies have a characteristic of having greater fat reserves.
<BR>
This allows them to live longer after their mouth/feeding parts wear out.
<BR>
You can imagine that prehistoric humans suffered nutritional deficiencies
<BR>
after they lost all their teeth that would contribute to decreased longevity.
<BR>
Elephants die because their teeth wear out.
<BR>
<P>However -- it is difficult for me to connect these things with long-term
<BR>
climate cycles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; long-distance north-south migratory beasties might live longer than others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the same metabolic indices;
</EM><BR>
<P>Birds live longer because they have a generally lower hazard function
<BR>
(very few predators).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and fish, lobsters or other critters in the stabilised environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the sea might produce some species that escape mortality entirely (as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Joao was suggesting, I think).
</EM><BR>
<P>The two species that Kirkwood suggests escape mortality entirely are
<BR>
sea anenomies and hydra.  Sturgeon, Rock fish, lobsters and giant clams
<BR>
probably all benefit from the stable environment and/or good defenses
<BR>
that allows nature to evolve their programs towards slowly aging
<BR>
phenotypes.  It is likely to be impossible to get a completely non-aging
<BR>
phenotype because you cannot grow large enough to produce ever more
<BR>
offspring to maintain the fraction of &quot;longevity&quot; genes in the
<BR>
overall species gene pool.  Subsets of the species that divert energy
<BR>
for maintenance and repair into reproduction will eventually
<BR>
out reproduce those that sacrifice reproduction for repair.  This
<BR>
results in species longevity averages that are shorter than what
<BR>
could be possible.
