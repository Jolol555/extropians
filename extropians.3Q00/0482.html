You can change the world a lot faster with a Singularity. Can you make an
<BR>
argument showing that it would be better to spend my time having political
<BR>
discussions, and generally &quot;working within the system&quot;, rather than &quot;playing
<BR>
a bit with computers&quot; as you so unbiasedly put it?

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; What I suggest, is to &quot;cheerfully&quot; explain to the merely curious or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the misinformed that the universe is way-big enough for all kinds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; religions and plenty of room left over for atheists to. Baring that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; if they are persistently obnoxious, give their nuts a healthy tweak.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Unfortunately I think you miss Waldemar's point. The misinformed will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;simply believe that we are some sort of cult, and then not listen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;us (how often do we *listen* to religious fundamentalists, and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;just picking up stuff to make fun of?).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks Anders!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the above shows that the transhumanist movement today lacks a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; analysis of its present environment that my point didn't go through. What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are we perceived as, by the current mainstream? In what ways is it possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for transhumanism to be negatively/ positively perceived? What are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinions of the mainstream on the topics we are discussing?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Those are important questions! This because transhumanism is an ideology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with far reaching implications, a system building philosophy! With deep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implications also in the field of political theory, and ethics, this as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain kinds of politics and ethics will work to the advantage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanism, and others certainly wont.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If we don't care about these issues we are just playing a bit with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computers, or having dreamy discussions about physics. But these things are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not INHERENTLY transhumanist, they could be discussed otherwise. And if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't have the tools to bring forward the societal change most will soon get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disillusioned BECAUSE THEY RIGHTLY NOT FIND TRANSHUMANISM PRACTICAL, it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just a pasttime. But with the right tools, right analysis, and right
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguments we can change the world to a society that fits our ideas better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sincerely,
</EM><BR>
