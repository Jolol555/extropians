<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Capitalists have never:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;a) operated concentration camps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;b) exterminated people they refused to do business with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ever heard of a group of folks called &quot;Native Americans?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since when are Native Americans Socialists or Communists?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm.  They hunted together and shared the spoils with the entire tribe.  
<BR>
Each one worked according to his own ability, and consumed according to his 
<BR>
need.  What would you call that, capitalism?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If they were exterminated, how come they're still around?
</EM><BR>
<P>Learned your American history from Lone Ranger re-runs, eh?  Many tribes are 
<BR>
no longer around.  If what happened to the natives doesn't qualify as 
<BR>
&quot;extermination&quot; because there are still some people left on the planet who 
<BR>
refer to themselves as Native Americans, then there has never been an 
<BR>
exterminated people in all of human history.
