<P><EM>&gt; You know, there is a wealth of literature  - the Bible, the tale of

<EM>&gt; Gilgamesh, the Shah Nama, etc., which describes individuals living for

<EM>&gt; centuries, followed by a slowly declining lifespan leveling out where we are

<EM>&gt; now.  Of course, it is possible and even likely that this is just mythology.

<P>I can imagine a mechanism whereby such accounts would have gotten
<BR>
recorded: as the stories and legends were passed down verbally thru the ages
<BR>
each generation perceived the fathers and grandfathers as much older
<BR>
than the teller perceived himself, even when the teller reached the same
<BR>
age the ancestor was at his passing.  For that reason, since the teller
<BR>
knows his own age but is unsure of the age of the ancestor, he would
<BR>
simply add ten or twenty years, or perhaps fifty.  The process is repeated
<BR>
until the advent of writing, and you end up with 900+ year lifespans.  spike
