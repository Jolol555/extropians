<P>
<EM>&gt; Destructive:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Like Punk rock, which saw rock as pompous and arrogant and overblown; who's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sole goal was to dismantle the mechanism of that genre __ and this is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important, Lee: 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's partly a misunderstanding on your part.  We do not seek
<BR>
the destruction of governance, only the elimination of monopoly
<BR>
governance by force.  Even the most radical anarchist libertarians
<BR>
want a government, we just want to be able to chose which one
<BR>
among several competing for our business.  We seek not to destroy
<BR>
anything, but to provide a moral foundation for governance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Libertarians have yet to show me any solid evidence that their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antigovernment deconstructivist theories will actually work.
</EM><BR>
<P>So what?  If you need absolute proof that something will work
<BR>
before you even consider it, you're no Extropian.  What we /have/
<BR>
shown your proof of is that the welfare state is a miserable
<BR>
failure, and that freedom in general produces good results.
<BR>
There is also ample evidence that many of the services provided
<BR>
by governments now can be better provided privately.  If you can't
<BR>
see that, then you're willfully ignoring the facts.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am a constructionist. I prefer to make -- not break. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Good, so are we.  This is meaningless drivel.  We want to
<BR>
build a system of governance--with most of the same services
<BR>
that governments provide today--but on a moral foundation.
<BR>
We only seek to destroy those functions of government that
<BR>
are positively evil, and which no sane human being could
<BR>
possibly support.  The rest we hope will become irrelevant
<BR>
as those services are provided privately.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Lacking in Compassion:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I am an advocate of a kind of love called &quot;tough love&quot;. This means that in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some cases, I agree with some of the thoughts of libertarians. But-- I said 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it before Lee, you look to me like you are always saying &quot;tough shit&quot; about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how anyone else feels, both in your social interactions and your political 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones. You don;t give a rats ass about me, you call me your enemy, you say 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being rude is a tool -- you do not display a caring attitude about people. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Emotion has its place, but if you think that making important
<BR>
decisions about life--and particularly about other people--should
<BR>
be made emotionally we'll just have to disagree.  I believe I have
<BR>
a moral obligation to use solid reason to determine my choice of
<BR>
action with others.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is a constant bitter nattering about how people don't deserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to share anything you have, and this &quot;stealing at gunpoint&quot; attitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when tax time comes around. That's one way of looking at it, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not the only way.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have no resentment at all to sharing as such, but I /do/ resent
<BR>
very strongly the gun pointed at me, and that's not just an &quot;attitude&quot;
<BR>
or point of view.  It is a simple, undeniable fact.  Monopoly
<BR>
government exercises its madates by FORCE, period.  If you deny
<BR>
that, you are simply ignoring reality, and no amount of argument
<BR>
is worth wasting on you.  No amount of justification for the ends
<BR>
of this violence hold any water for me.  The means matter: if you
<BR>
have to use violence to accomplish your goals, I don't care how
<BR>
otherwise worthy they might be.  Find another way.  We have offered
<BR>
some /possible/ solutions for how to accomplish your ends with
<BR>
moral means--you only whine that we haven't proven that they'll
<BR>
work.  SO WHAT?  To me, it is /your/ moral obligation to fully
<BR>
justify /your/ use of violence as absolutely necessary before I'll
<BR>
even consider it an alternative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is a general laissez faire - no pity- no sorrow - about the hurt 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feelings of others. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's just me, not the philosophy.  Please don't confuse my
<BR>
personal crusade for the value of rudeness to reflect upon rank-
<BR>
and-file libertarians.  I'm sure most of them think I'm as obnoxious
<BR>
as you do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But when difficult social and protection issues (crime and punishment, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institutionalized racism, indigent childcare, hospitailztion for the poor,  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feeding and care of mentally ill, elder care, public transportation costs, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support for the handicapped, language anomalies, sexual abuse, etc., etc.) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are brought to bear, libertarians get pissed and won't talk about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complexities. It's either: I'm sick to death of being told: Oh, &quot;it will work 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; itself out in the free market -  or:  Let them vote with their pocketbooks OR 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rich people will give money instead of the govt (yeah right) OR angry 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spitfire and a total denial of the situation at hand. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Libertarians are tough, oh yes, but I fail to see the love shining in their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eyes.
</EM><BR>
<P>But we /do/ talk about the complexities all the time.  There are
<BR>
hundreds of detailed papers on every one of those topics.  We don't
<BR>
generally bring them up here because that's one of the &quot;basics&quot;
<BR>
that we've earlier agreed not to waste time on.  But if you can't
<BR>
be bothered to read and understand our positions on these matters
<BR>
when all that information is easlily available, then don't complain
<BR>
that we don't deal with the hard issues.  We do deal with them, and
<BR>
there is ample literature and study to prove it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  And I really can't watch the decay and despair of the population above 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without &quot;feeling their pain&quot;. I really could not. When they suffer, so do I. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Good.  So do I.  And so do most people.  That's precisely why it
<BR>
isn't necessary to MANDATE empathy or compassion.  Most people are
<BR>
pretty good anyway, and will help where there is need, just as I'm
<BR>
sure you and I do every day.  I don't want to abolish humanity; I
<BR>
want to free it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You seem to think it's you vs. them, I see us as the same. 
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not us (the rich) vs. them (the unfortunate), it's us
<BR>
(the knowledgeable compassionate libertarians) vs. them (the
<BR>
compassionate but misguided advocates of force).  We really do
<BR>
have the same ends, no matter how much you protest otherwise.
<BR>
It's just that the means to gettng there /do/ matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; SO you see... the crux of the paradox lies here: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to honor the parts of your chatter that will bring about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change, but totally disavow the parts that are destructive,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean and bitter.
</EM><BR>
<P>More vagueness and evasion.  If those parts of my argument
<BR>
that you consider mean and bitter are actually debateable
<BR>
facts, then debate them.  If they are merely your impression
<BR>
of my rehtorical style, then just call me a cranky old
<BR>
bastard and be done with it.  I concede that point.  After
<BR>
hashing over these old arguments for 20 years and still
<BR>
being confronted with misunderstandings, misrepresentations,
<BR>
and irrelevant emotional asides, I've gotten pretty cranky.
<BR>
If those parts are merely your speculation about my motives,
<BR>
then they're irrelevant.
<BR>
