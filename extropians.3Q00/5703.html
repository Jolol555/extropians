Michael S. Lorrey writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Primarily because it is on a virtual system that is dependent upon us in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real world to maintain. Just as I would not let a child loose in the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without supervision, I would not let a new AI loose on the net or have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capabilities in the real world which limited our ability to supervise it. Once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it has proven its ability and good will, controls may be loosened, but every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such entity should always have an off switch of some kind, just as humans do.
</EM><BR>
<P>In further support of your comments, I'd add that the &quot;off switch&quot; for an AI
<BR>
could actually terminate or delete it. This means that it would be *much* easier
<BR>
to control unruly AIs than to control human children, since we (unfortunately?)
<BR>
can't actually terminate recalcitrant or sociopathic (i.e., unfriendly) human
<BR>
children.
<BR>
Furthermore, AIs could compete with each other to see who could be the
<BR>
friendliest, and only the most friendly would be allowed to replicate -- the
<BR>
rest being discarded. Similar treatment of human child populations might meet
<BR>
with resistance from their mothers (to say the least).
<BR>
As a result, we can deal much more severely and harshly with Mind Children than
<BR>
we can deal with human children. Bottom line: I think we have more to fear from
<BR>
fiendish human hackers than from Spiritual Machines, Robo sapiens, Artilects, or
<BR>
Mind Children.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Really, Zero, do you still beat your parents for being so fearful of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tyranny, or are they already buried in the back yard?
</EM><BR>
<P>Really, Michael, you have a way of summing up a topic with wickedly incisive
<BR>
sagacious brevity.
<BR>
Bravo!
<BR>

<P>&quot;Artists can color the sky red because they know it's blue.
<BR>
Those of us who aren't artists must color things the way they
<BR>
really are or people might think we're stupid.&quot;
