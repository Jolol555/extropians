<EM>&gt; I am sorry if my last post has been upsetting to all of you. However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you carefully read what I said in the part that triggered your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reactions, it was the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;I know from personal research that several extropians or transhumanists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are guilty of ....
</EM><BR>
<P>Read your own writing. You are specifically NOT saying that these are
<BR>
allegations, nor are you posting your sources. You are making claims as to
<BR>
actual facts. To claim that you are not doing so is a lie.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words, I said I had come across a verbal accusation from a trusted source. I openly admit that I do not at this point have legal evidence, but have strong enough indications to make me suspicious or curious.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you said &quot;I know&quot;, not &quot;I've read reports&quot; or &quot;I've seen allegations&quot;. These
<BR>
are very different things. You also say 'are guilty', not 'alleged'. These are
<BR>
also very different things. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When I bring this up here, I get attacked, pushed into weird pseudo-philosophical corners and threatened with all kinds of legal and semi-legal attacks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One poster in fact goes as far as using the word &quot;lynch&quot;. All I hear from Mr More is I am a liar and he wants to sue me. Others want to remove the whole thread from the archive, thereby censoring free speech.
</EM><BR>
<P>Free speech does not include the right to scream FIRE in a theater.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The whole outrage is not directed at the despicable action I wonder about, but against my wondering in public. And then you are surprised that I do not wish to reveal my identity at this point?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unjustly accusing a person of a despicable crime is one of the cardinal sins of
<BR>
our civilization. Since we know Max, and you, as far as we are concerned, are
<BR>
absolutely nobody, it is you upon whom the outrage rests and the burden of proof
<BR>
lies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not that I don't agree that there could have possibly been a better way to sort this out. I simply did not foresee the fury I created, and for this I am sorry.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bullshit. If it was unintentional, then you must be functionally illiterate with
<BR>
the IQ of a casava melon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the rumor is false, and if Mr More is not in support of such behavior, all that is necessary is a clear statement to that effect, not retaliation for an imagined wrong. All this excitement only makes me wonder...
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah bullshit again. You're just trying to keep the friggin thing going. 
<BR>
<P>Here's some info about where this Bozo is posting from, and the relatively close
<BR>
proximity of significant Scientologist facilities:
<BR>
<P>2 miles away:
<BR>
HGB, the Hollywood Guarranty  Building, a twelve story office building at
<BR>
Hollywood Boulevard and Ivar formerly owned by the Bank of America. It is an old
<BR>
building that was constructed in the 1920s and purchased by Scientology with
<BR>
cash in the mid-'80s. All International management (upper middle management
<BR>
above continents and below *INT* - see Int) is located in this building. It is a
<BR>
twenty minute walk from the Cedars Complex, and houses IHELP, OSA Int, and the
<BR>
CMO IXU (Internal eXtension Unit), WISE Int, ABLE Int, and more. The various
<BR>
orgs on different floors in 1993 looked like this: 12th floor - OSA Int
<BR>
(includes office of the President of CSI). 11th - CMO IXU, AVU Int, confidential
<BR>
space. 10th - FCB, Networks. 9th - FB. 8th - FB, IHELP Int, SMI Int. 7th - WISE
<BR>
Int, ABLE Int. 6th - Dining room, canteen. 5th through 1st - ITO. 1st - LRH
<BR>
Exhibit, lobby. Basement - HGB Estates, FB's mimeo collection, INCOMM office. 
<BR>
<P>Other locations:
<BR>
~2000 feet from the Los Feliz Library
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY ADVANCED ORGANIZATION

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone: (323) 953-3200 
<BR>
<P>Less than 1 mile away:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY CELEBRITY CENTER INTERNATL
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5930 FRANKLIN AVE,  LOS ANGELES,  CA  90028
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P>It seems to me as though there is significant support for the Co$ theory. There
<BR>
is no listing at www.whitepages.com for a 'Jamrio Miller', though there are a
<BR>
number of 'J Miller' listings in the Hollywood area. There is a James R Miller
<BR>
in the 90024 zip code.
<BR>
<P>Here is a challenge: retract your statement in its entirety, and post the
<BR>
'trusted sources' you claim are making the accusations so that they may be
<BR>
examined as any evidence properly should be.
