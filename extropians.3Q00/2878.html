<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20Critique%20of%20Current%20GM%20Technology&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGEENOGAAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.org</A>
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The following critique of the current Ag/Bio GM technology and its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation was forwarded to me on an &quot;anti-GM&quot; mailing list:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     <A HREF="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dcandmkw/ge/gebrown.htm">http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~dcandmkw/ge/gebrown.htm</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd be very curious to see what sort of reaction it sparks from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who are more knowledgable about molecular biology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The greatest concerns of the &quot;public&quot; in general seem to have to do with
<BR>
immediate harm they, or other organisms such as butterflies, could suffer
<BR>
due to exposure to GM foods. The following passage from Patrick Brown's
<BR>
article was highlighted on the web page: &quot;Indeed, it can be argued that gene
<BR>
transfer via rDNA techniques resembles the process of viral infection far
<BR>
more closely than it resembles traditional breeding.&quot;  This sounds scary,
<BR>
and given that the highlighted portions are the only parts of the article
<BR>
that many people will read, it's probably safe to conclude that many people
<BR>
will come away from the article with a bit more convinced of the
<BR>
advisability of strict government controls on genetic research.
<BR>
<P>The following paragraphs from PB's article nicely summarize my main
<BR>
concerns:
<BR>
<P>&quot;The real threat to the future of plant biotechnology is the irresponsible
<BR>
and premature releases of the first generation of GMOs that are full of
<BR>
unsound scientific assumptions, rife with careless science, and arrogantly
<BR>
dismissive of valid concerns.
<BR>
<P>The current generation of GMOs provide little real benefit except corporate
<BR>
profit and marginally improved grower returns, while at the same time
<BR>
introducing a host of poorly studied human and ecological risks. Not
<BR>
surprisingly, many have questioned the value of these crops and the
<BR>
integrity of those who support their use.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The current state of research in the field of plant genetics (I'm speaking
<BR>
here only of US research; I'm not as familiar with reserach elsewhere) has
<BR>
been brought about largely by the high level of involvement of the federal
<BR>
government, and government-assisted corporations such as Monsanto, in
<BR>
agricultural research of all sorts. Most agricultural schools push the
<BR>
concept of farming-be-formula as the only possible way to go; and every
<BR>
formula will naturally involve the use of the commercial products offered by
<BR>
Monsanto.
<BR>
<P>Most US farmers rely heavily on various subsidies provided by the federal
<BR>
gov't, and again at the level of local agricultural extension services,
<BR>
farming-by-formula is pushed as the only sensible way to go.  This isn't
<BR>
surprising given that the extension service agents have been educated in the
<BR>
schools which teach this same thing.
<BR>
<P>The conclusion drawn by the &quot;public&quot; seems to be that we need MORE gov't
<BR>
involvement in agricultural.  The only way I can see that someone could
<BR>
logically arrive at this conclusion is by ignoring most of the available
<BR>
data.
<BR>
<P>The greatest threat I see from the current direction of GM technology is
<BR>
widespread famine in the not so distant future as a larger and larger
<BR>
proportion of the world's agricutural lands are planted in genetically
<BR>
almost-identical cultivars of a few staple crops. This same danger existed
<BR>
with the use of hybrid corns produced the old-fashioned way; it's not unique
<BR>
to GM crops.  What disturbs me is that GM technology is being used to push
<BR>
world agriculture farther along that same path rather than along a more
<BR>
healthily branching path of genetic diversity.
<BR>
<P>The 1970 corn leaf blight epidemic, which destroyed half the corn crop from
<BR>
Floria to Texas, should be heeded as a warning.  In this case a new strain
<BR>
of the fungus which causes southern leaf blight was able to spread unchecked
<BR>
through fields of genetically identical hybrid corn. This would not have
<BR>
been nearly so likely to happen with wider genetic diversity in corn
<BR>
cultivars and smaller fields of corn interplanted with other crops. As the
<BR>
shift is made world-wide from thousands of local cultivars to the
<BR>
farming-by-formula use of a few GM cultivars, the danger increases of a
<BR>
larger-scale version of the corn blight catastrophe. I'd go so far as to say
<BR>
it's inevitable if the agricultural industry continues its present course.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see more pure research being done, more effort put into
<BR>
UNDERSTANDING genetics.  There are so many questions that are interesting in
<BR>
and of themselves--such as, for instance, how transposons fit into the
<BR>
process. But most of the money that's available for genetic research is
<BR>
funneled through the federal gov't and corporations and universities
<BR>
controlled by the same ideas and often the same people.
<BR>
<P>One solution I see is to set up research facilities that are not associated
<BR>
in any way with any gov't or gov't assisted corporation. As I've mentioned
<BR>
before on this list, an &quot;underground&quot; economy with &quot;underground&quot; research
<BR>
facilities.
<BR>
