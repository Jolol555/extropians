<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism often falls into the trap of discussing VERY remote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technologies, while completely neglecting the present. I think it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because, if we're discussing the present topics like economics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; philosophy, sociology etc come into the forefront. But those are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; topics that people in general discuss at all- they are so mired in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what is considered &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;moral&quot; today that transhumanists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even adopt the stasist point of view towards them (comes with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fact of a hegemony being present in these topics).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yes, I have noted this too (and often contributed to it - omega point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;physics is so much simpler than economics!).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The problem is that most of us are not well educated in economics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophy and sociology, and that it often doesn't seem they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessary. After all, the system largely works, doesn't it? We miss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the obvious stuff just because it is right under our noses, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concentrate on the rest.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, it is not only a question about being educated in those 
<BR>
matters. It is a question about attitudes, ideas, and reference systems.
<BR>
<P><P>But transhumanism is very much about
<BR>
<EM>&gt;questioning the way things have always been, *all* of the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;condition - including how we relate to the current philosophical,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political, social and economical systems. If we don't question things,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to come up with new solutions and then test them to see if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are better than the current ones we will be dependent on the solutions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other groups produce, solutions which may not just be bad but also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;based on fundamentally incompatible values.
</EM><BR>
<P>And one of the main problems is that these things go hand in hand. Or would 
<BR>
really absolute monarchy work in the information era?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I find reading the journal &quot;Futures&quot; valuable, as there I often
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;encounter radically different ideas about what a desirable future
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be like. There have been papers discussing how to get *out* of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this spiral of technological advancement and into some nice, &quot;more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human&quot;, static world - an idea I find abhorrent as stated (because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implies that *everyone* must do it), but is widely accepted in many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circles. If we don't learn to deal with the real world issues well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from *our* philosophical point of view, the above view might well be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what spreads into most economical and political solutions, badly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cramping us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yup, what is the transhumanist future in the short span? I have often 
<BR>
wondered about that, and I have found really no answers from the movement 
<BR>
(so I thought up my own).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;On the other hand, in the latest issue of the journal (Futures 32
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(2000) 603-612) there was also &quot;Millennium Project's draft scenarios
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the next 1000 years&quot; by Jerome C. Glenn, which contains some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long-range future scenarios from the Millennium Project. These three
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scenarios contained many elements we are used to: nanotech, AI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cyborgization, radical changes in the human condition. One of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scenarios was a very nice and somewhat Star Trek-esque united Earth in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;3000 (but with some problems), another was the extinction of humanity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and the subsequent evolution of AI and the third dealt with a humanity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;splitting between people for or against radical technological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;changes. The interesting thing was that these ideas are now part of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;serious future studies, and they will percolate outwards from there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is of course great, but it gave me pause to find that in the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of factors most likely to affect the next 1000 years immortality was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the second last place!  Also, note the relative ranking here (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think the index is simply the product of the probability, importance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and priority if they occur):

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the ranking tells us much about general opinions on what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;important.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which of these factors are we discussing the most? Human genetics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nanotech, increasing intelligence, human extinction, conscious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology, conscious evolution, space migration, extraterrestrial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contact, immortality and interspecies communication - yes. That mainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leaves out human-environment dynamics, safe energy, forms of movement,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;collective futures, climate change, gender relations, philosophy and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;global ethical systems. Sure, we have discussed all of these too, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with far less rigor (and in many cases with more rancor :-) - but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is almost half of what the Project considers important for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;millennium! And this is an admittedly hubristic super-long-range
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;study, a near-term study would almost certainly put a much greater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weight on these issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is controlling the hegemony?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To continue, there is another paper in that issue: (Futures 32 (2000)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;595-602) &quot;The twilight of the Baconian age and the future of humanity&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by Francisco Sagasti. This paper claims that the Baconian program is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;running out (it can be seen as the program Francis Bacon began 400
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years ago with his idea that technology and science can be used to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improve the human condition, that progress is possible, desirable and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nearly inevitable etc), both due to increased internal and external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criticism (that is, the stuff we usually dismiss as &quot;luddites&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;conservatives&quot; and &quot;postmodernist fluff&quot;) and the fact that we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;now approaching a state where we are changing the human condition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;itself through a very changed view of physics, new discoveries in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ecology, biotechnology, psychology, anthropology, AI, virtual reality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and whatnot that are undermining the old notions of the human as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;center of the universe, or even an individual thing. The paper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concludes that we need a new direction for the post-Baconian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;era.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;While I dislike the tone of the paper a bit I think it says something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;directly to us transhumanists. We are already thinking *partially* in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this post-Baconian world, and we do have the chance to be the ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that explore it, set the agenda, come up with the influential myths!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But to do that we have to give up the default assumptions of the old -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without falling into a postmodern mist of relativism and hidden
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;authority worship.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, we have to formulate a philosophical system and an explanation 
<BR>
system of our own (damn, that sounded bad in English. I think you get my 
<BR>
point though and can explain it better in English)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This was just two papers from a single issue, but both suggest that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;1) have a problem and 2) that we have a wonderful opportunity! So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;let's start educating ourselves even more in everyday psychology and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophy, in economics and ecology, in politics and physics. We need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the practical *combinations*, good ideas like Idea Futures, WWW and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tupperware marketing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, it is not as much an educational problem per se, as an educational 
<BR>
problem of transhumanist ideology, isn't it?
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar
