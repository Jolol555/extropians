<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ah, you see, now you've started this conversation down what I consider
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the interesting road.  I -do- believe in a type of reality-- the realm
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I -am- going to respond briefly to this.
<BR>
<P><P>Let us say that I look at an orange pen.  There a few claims that I am able
<BR>
to make about that orangeness, and each claim can be rated by degree of
<BR>
certainty.
<BR>
<P>1.)  The pen is orange.  (appeal to the reality of existence)
<BR>
<P>This is a problematic statement for deeper reasons I've already given, but
<BR>
let's simply deal with the basics: perhaps a light source is altering the
<BR>
appearance of the pen, perhaps it's virtual reality, or perhaps a piece of
<BR>
orange gel has been placed between me and the pen.  In any case I cannot
<BR>
have absolute certainty regarding such a statement.
<BR>
<P>2.)  I see the color orange.  (appeal to the reality of the senses)
<BR>
<P>This has much greater certainty.  You can't say to me: &quot;Aha, no, the pen is
<BR>
really blue!  I was just bouncing orange light off of it!&quot; because I wasn't
<BR>
claiming that the pen was orange, I was claiming that I perceived the color
<BR>
orange.  This statement is -almost- 100% absolutely true.  Why 'almost?'
<BR>
Well, it -is- possible that I was hallucinating-- that the pen was a mental
<BR>
construct and my eyes were actually perceiving nothing at all.
<BR>
<P>3.)  I have a mental construct of the color orange.  (appeal to the reality
<BR>
of the mind)
<BR>
<P>It is possible to have absolute, 100% certainty regarding the realm of the
<BR>
mind.  You cannot be shown to have been in error.  If you were
<BR>
hallucinating, if it was virtual reality, if the image was placed there by
<BR>
aliens from another planet, you are still 100% correct to state that you
<BR>
experienced a particular brain state.  Currently this is the only realm in
<BR>
which we are able to make absolute statements of reality.
<BR>
<P><P>I -do- believe in the mind.
<BR>
<P>I link the reality of my mind functionally to my external environment-- this
<BR>
way I don't bump into sharp objects.
<BR>
<P>Also, the mere fact that there is a possibility that I can be incorrect in
<BR>
the first two statements doesn't mean that I am.  I'm simply recognizing
<BR>
that there is a possibility-- and that these are not absolute reality
<BR>
states.
<BR>
<P>And this sword cuts both ways: Having absolute certainty regarding a mental
<BR>
state does not always translate into something useful in the external
<BR>
environment.
