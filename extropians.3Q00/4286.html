I asked:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Under standard accounts, decisions are made by combining positions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on values and beliefs about facts.  ... So which is it, do our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disagreements with opponents tend to be more about values, or more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about facts?
</EM><BR>
<P>Many people here don't seem to accept the standard account of decisions.
<BR>
John Clark is the only one who gave a straight answer: &quot;Values I think.&quot;
<BR>
<P>QueeneMUSE replied &quot;Obviously it's both,&quot; and Eugene Leitl said &quot;it can
<BR>
only be decided from case to case.&quot;  So I guess they reject the idea that
<BR>
a set of cases can &quot;tend&quot; more in one direction than the other.

<EM>&gt;I doubt that the fact/value distinction holds up under close scrutiny.  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem like values almost always represent positions held only contingent on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;certain factual assumptions.  Take, for example, valuing &quot;the environment.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Though proponents of environmentalism often present it as a per se good, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in truth accept certain claims--industrialism increases human suffering,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ecosystems exist in balanced harmony absent human intervention, population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;growth increases pollution, and so forth--that may or may not be facts.  Only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at a very fundamental, arational level--seek social status, maximize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pleasure/pain ratios, reproduce, and so forth--do values not rely on beliefs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about facts.  And at that level, almost everyone agrees.
</EM><BR>
<P>T. appears at first to reject the fact/value distinction, but as far as I can
<BR>
tell then embraces it as holding at a fundamental level.  And I agree that
<BR>
decision making often uses multiple levels of beliefs, where beliefs at each
<BR>
level are built on beliefs from the level below, and that beliefs above the
<BR>
base level are often mixtures of facts and values.  If every disagreement at
<BR>
a higher level can be traced to disagreements about lower level beliefs,
<BR>
however, then it seems we can still talk about how much a disagreement is
<BR>
due to facts versus values.  In principle, we just trace disagreements back
<BR>
to the fundamental level belief disagreements they are due to, and see how
<BR>
much of those are values versus facts.  And given T.'s last statement, it
<BR>
seems that T. thinks most disagreements are about facts, presumably including
<BR>
our disagreements with opponents.
