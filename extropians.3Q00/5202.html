<EM>&gt; Dear List Members
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of these posts are disturbing - I cannot descern sarcasm from factual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statement; the women from the righteous males. In short, I cannot believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what I'm reading.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a human who happens to reside in female form, I am most interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your personal pov on forced-pregnancy and abortion. Perhaps you would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to share your feelings and experiences:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1. Do you think a female should be forced to endure every pregnancy?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think a female should be forced to get pregnant. Anything else that
<BR>
happens is a result of either consensus decisions between her and the male
<BR>
involved, or a negotiated settlement or ruling enforced by courts if complete
<BR>
consensus is not reached prior to conception. Note that while two people may be
<BR>
consensual about having sex, they very likely have not reached a consensus about
<BR>
what to do for the next 18 years if she gets pregnant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2. If so, what should happen to them, that is, mother and child?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3. Do you support absolute dominion over one's own body?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but a pregancy does not involve just one body. You are dealing, in fact,
<BR>
with three bodies (at a minimum), and any woman so callous as to totally
<BR>
disregard the rights and concerns of the other two very likely would be a very
<BR>
poor candidate for motherhood anyways, not to mention for being human, but of
<BR>
course, there is a matter of context/circumstances, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4. As a female, would you terminate an untimely pregnancy?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since I'm not, I don't have to worry about that, as a female. As a male, I've
<BR>
already once been through an experience where a girlfriend got pregnant, did not
<BR>
tell me, went off and got an abortion, and I did not hear about it for a couple
<BR>
years from a third party. We broke up before I found out, for likely the same
<BR>
reasons she got the abortion: She was an extremely selfish, self-centerd,
<BR>
materialistic woman. When I later found out what she did, I cannot say I was at
<BR>
all surprised, though I was rather bothered by what she did.
