I would just write linux to &quot;d or whatever&quot; and let the boot write to the 
<BR>
mBR
<BR>
<P>Mandrake linux is fairly easy to install (If I can do it anyone can)
<BR>
<P><P><P>Emlyn complained:
<BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; All this multiple OS stuff is getting to me; I've recently come to have a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; need to run Linux, which means I've probably got to upgrade my (sorry, my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; wife's) desktop machine &amp; dual boot it between NT &amp; Linux, or get another
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; machine just for that purpose; my notebook has room, but after the fight 
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM> &gt; had to install NT &amp; 95 on it in a stable configuration, I'll be damned if
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM> &gt; go upsetting things trying to get Linux to multi-boot &amp; support obscure
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hardware. I can't have a CDROM &amp; floppy disk drive connected
</EM><BR>
simultaneously;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; I doubt I could even shoehorn Linux in at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Then I've got to bite the bullet and put a network in (my machines are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; currently totally seperate). It's a world of pain.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Is it just me, or is this kind of system setup stuff a true nightmare for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; everyone (well, except Harvey)?
</EM><BR>
<P>it's not too bad.  i used to have nt, 95, linux and dos all multibooting but
<BR>
i stopped needing nt and dos  (i originally dropped 95 too, but it crept
<BR>
back in by game force, even if it doesn't get much use).  the main problem
<BR>
is that NT wants to be booted from its own loader so you can either hook the
<BR>
nt loader off lilo (preferably on it's own hard drive), or add the kernel to
<BR>
the choices in the NT boot loader.  the main problem with the second option
<BR>
is that it is a pain to update your linux kernel because you have to make a
<BR>
new bootsector image and copy it to an NT visible partition (but if you are
<BR>
going to use the stable linux releases, you won't need to do this very
<BR>
often).  look up the NT-WIN95-Linux mini howto (say here:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Multiboot-with-LILO.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Multiboot-with-LILO.html</A>)  for a better
<BR>
explanation.
<BR>
good luck.
