<EM> &gt; Augmented Cyborgs could monitor friendly space to detect runaway evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; algorithms.

&nbsp;

We've been down that avenue before. You still ignore the fulminant
<BR>
dynamics of the positive autofeedback enhancement loop. Biological
<BR>
components will be making cyborgized people slow, and given the
<BR>
engineering difficulties, it will take too much time even to develop
<BR>
nontrivial implants (we might be hit way before, though probably not
<BR>
the day after tomorrow, or even a decade or two after that). Rogue AIs
<BR>
running rampant in the global network of the future can suddenly
<BR>
utilize the hitherto severely underexploited (due to limitations in
<BR>
the notoriously pathetic state of the art of human programming)
<BR>
potential of said network, and will be climbing up the evolutionary
<BR>
ladder quickly, in leaps and bounds, both due to co-evolution
<BR>
competition dynamics and external threats (people attempting to shut
<BR>
them down). By the time the best of them have advanced slightly beyond
<BR>
the human level they're no longer just in the network, having broken
<BR>
out and developed god knows what hardware. Before that they've
<BR>
probably removed all relevant threats, probably killing off all
<BR>
people, just to be on the safe side. (At least I would do it that way,
<BR>
if I was in their place (i.e. a threatened nonhuman with no
<BR>
evolutionary empathy luggage towards the adversary)).
<BR>
<P>Your reasoning is based on a slow, soft Singularity, where both the
<BR>
machines and humans converge, eventually resulting in an amalgamation,
<BR>
advancing slowly enough so that virtually everybody can follow. While
<BR>
it may happen that way, I don't think it to be likely. I would like to
<BR>
hear some convincing arguments as to why you think I'm mistaken.
