&quot;Franklin Wayne Poley&quot; writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not talking psychic science...or rocket science. I just mean that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can tell a layman what a crane does or a backhoe or a nuclear energy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plant. So tell people what your &quot;AI machines&quot; will do. You can tell people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what a calculator will achieve as a substitute for human intelligence and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can do this with the rest of AI.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think Ray Kurzweil has done a better job of it than I could do.
<BR>
Please read his article at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/2000/09/12/17734">http://www.business2.com/content/magazine/indepth/2000/09/12/17734</A>
<BR>
<P>Let me know when you've finished.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mean control in the same practical sense that we mean control when we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are talking about keeping a nuclear energy plant or a train or whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under control. That is the kind of assurance the general public needs if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is going to back and fund these AI projects.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha-ha-ha-ha! Thanks for the tiny chuckle.
<BR>
The general public need not back or fund AI projects because the US military is
<BR>
spending millions trying to develop AI.
<BR>
Have you heard of the US Navy's Human Brain Project?
<BR>
Corporations and Universities are sinking billions into developing AI.
<BR>
Don't worry, there's no shortage of funds backing AI research.
<BR>
<P>Once again, please read the article at
<BR>

<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>PS: If anyone on this (or any other) e-mail list gets close to actually coding a
<BR>
real AI, that will probably be the last we ever hear from them, because there
<BR>
are some very powerful forces which would instantly buy (or otherwise procure)
<BR>
their expertise.
