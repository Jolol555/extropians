Subject: Re: GUNS: Why here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Corey asks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; What exactly IS the relevance of the gun discussion to Extropianism?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think many contemporary issues have great relevance to Extropianism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not only guns, but abortion and drug policy as well.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With guns, we have a dangerous technology.  Should it be in the hands
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;private individuals?  Or should society reserve access to the
</EM><BR>
government?
<BR>
<EM>&gt;This question is going to arise more and more in the future.
</EM><BR>
<P>The reason for an armed populace is very, very fundamental:
<BR>
<P>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
<BR>
equal, that they are
<BR>
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
<BR>
these are
<BR>
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these
<BR>
rights, Governments
<BR>
are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
<BR>
the governed,
<BR>
--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these
<BR>
ends, it is
<BR>
the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
<BR>
Government,
<BR>
laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in
<BR>
such form, as to
<BR>
&nbsp;them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
<BR>
Prudence, indeed,
<BR>
will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for
<BR>
light and
<BR>
transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that
<BR>
mankind are more
<BR>
disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
<BR>
by abolishing
<BR>
the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses
<BR>
and
<BR>
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to
<BR>
reduce them
<BR>
under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw
<BR>
off such
<BR>
Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--. ...&quot;
<BR>
<P>This is the purpose of the Second Amendment, which is taken from the
<BR>
The Virginia Declaration of Rights
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/billrights/virginia.html">http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/billrights/virginia.html</A>
<BR>
<P>&quot;Section 13. That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the
<BR>
people,
<BR>
trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free
<BR>
state; that
<BR>
standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to
<BR>
liberty;
<BR>
and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination
<BR>
to, and
<BR>
governed by, the civil power.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Something well over 50 million state-sponsored deaths in various regions
<BR>
<P>occured during the 20th Century as the direct result of gun control,
<BR>
often within
<BR>
a few years after a general confiscation. This 'experiment' has been run
<BR>
enough
<BR>
times to form a postulate:
<BR>
Guns don't kill people, despotic governments do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Another common thread in all of these issues is that not only will
</EM><BR>
there
<BR>
<EM>&gt;be new challenges, but they will become much more difficult to detect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and control.  Today you can theoretically catch someone who is buying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guns, getting an abortion, or purchasing drugs.
</EM><BR>
<P>All of which are microscopic issues compared to the manifold crimes of
<BR>
the state.
<BR>
Detecting a US-operated regional death camp in Iraq, or the
<BR>
mass-drugging
<BR>
of schoolchildren (Ritalin, crank) in the US, just for a couple
<BR>
examples, does
<BR>
not require very advanced technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The issues we face today, difficult as they are to deal with, are only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a taste of the problems ahead.  We need to identify sound philosophical
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;principles which can guide our decisions on these matters, in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chart a consistent course through the issues we will soon be dealing
</EM><BR>
with.
<BR>
<P>See above, also Federalist papers, other writings of Jefferson, etc.
<BR>
<P>I hope this is quite clear.
<BR>
