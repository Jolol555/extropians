<P>Subject:    David Bowie/Cher  -Poster Children for the &quot;almost
<BR>
transhuman/extropian&quot;
<BR>
<P>Are the superstars of today the natural precursors to the
<BR>
transhumans of tomorrow?
<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>&quot; There's the conundrum of how one is supposed to , as they say,
<BR>
&quot;stay young&quot; Well I don't believe it has anything to do with young -
<BR>
because I know a lot of young people who have absolutely no enthusiasm
<BR>
for life whatsoever - and deal with it very passively.....
<BR>
I believe it has to more to do with staying in touch with the
<BR>
society in which you live and not loosing  sight of those
<BR>
things that keep you excited&quot;  - David Bowie
<BR>
<P>This from a man who is looking veery good at age +/- 54 years, is wealthy,
<BR>
married to a supernmodel, has his own Internet ISP site (BowieNet),
<BR>
involved with fine arts, stage productions, has released three albums
<BR>
in the last few years and the list goes on and on ... despite the fact that
<BR>
he smokes, gallons of coffee and doesn't enjoy exercise! I wonder if this
<BR>
longevity has anything to do with the fact that he was known as the &quot;Thin
<BR>
White Duke at one stage. Could this be the result of unintentional calorie
<BR>
restriction - despite the periods err experitments with mind expanding
<BR>
substances ;-)
