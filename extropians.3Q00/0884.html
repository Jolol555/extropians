<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
Since I've been asked to give some ideas of how artists
<BR>
might go about making money in the absence of copyright,
<BR>
which makes the old business model of selling little
<BR>
disks of information obsolete, I'll lay out a few ideas
<BR>
here.  I'll limit the scope of discussion to musicians,
<BR>
which is what brought up the subject (different models
<BR>
might work better for things like books and software).
<BR>
<P>- The most obvious: live performance.  Music can be copied.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People can't (yet).  Your physical presence is therefore
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unique and valuable.  Back before FCC-monopolized radio,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this was how most musicians made money (even some of us
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on this list are old enough to remember when it was the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height of crassness to have recorded music at a party).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grateful Dead--the most financially successful musical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;group in history--proved that this model works.
<BR>
<P>- The second most obvious: work for hire: write songs for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people who pay you to write songs.  Folks like Mark
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knopfler and Jon Williams get millions for a movie
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;soundtrack.  Write commissioned pieces for commercials.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sell product placements in your lyrics.  (Neil &quot;Ain't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;singin' for Pepsi&quot; Young contributes to the poverty of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;musicians by giving them an idiotic ethic that making
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;money is bad).
<BR>
<P>- Personal appearance: even non-performing appearances can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be a revenue source for someone well-known enough.  Famous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;musicians make money endorsing products, appearing on talk
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shows, speaking at conferences, etc.  You can even sell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;small bits of personal access to fans, say by charging to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;answer email or phone calls about your music.
<BR>
<P>- Merchandising.  Just as your physical presence is unique
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and valuable, so is your name and reputation.  Sell T-Shirts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and mugs and posters on your website.  Sell memberships to a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fan club with benefits like a newsletter, entry to private
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;clubs or special seating at performances, limited-edition
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and autographed merchandise.  Sell &quot;authorized&quot; recordings
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that come with autographs or extra perks like discounts on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;performances, access to private clubs, etc.  Sell autographed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pictures and lyric sheets.
<BR>
<P>- Hipness/Timeliness: Even if the music can be copied, it can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;only be copied /after/ it is released, and there is value in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;being first on the block or &quot;hip&quot;.  Even an album that every-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one knew would be downloadable from the net January 2 would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sell copies on January 1, especially if it were arranged as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a premiere event, or as a perk for club members.
<BR>
<P>- Adaptation: Don't forget that without copyright, artists are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;also more free to draw upon previous work to create collages,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;adaptations, and other derivatives of other work.  Specialize
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in doing Disco or Reggae versions of pop tunes.  Make MIDI
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;transcriptions of other tunes.  Translate lyrics into other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;languages.  Make new arrangements for small bands to perform.
<BR>
<P>- Convenience: Even when information is cheap, /finding/ it is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not.  Consumer attention is valuable, so make the most of that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by making it easy for people to buy authorized recordings on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the authorized site and other easy-to-find locations.  Give them
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lots of versions of everything at good prices.  Capitalize on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their attention by selling advertising on the website and in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;your liner notes and on your merchandise.
<BR>
<P>- Voluntary contributions: I don't personally think much of this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;method, but a lot of people seem to so I'll mention it: solicit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;contributions based solely on goodwill.  Things like &quot;Street
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Performer Protocol&quot; make this easier.  This is the business
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;model for public television, for the most part.
<BR>
<P>That's a pageful off the top of my head; I'm sure there are more.
<BR>
So the next person who brings up the &quot;artists will starve without
<BR>
copyright&quot; meme will be fined the total of Micheal Jackson's
<BR>
interview fee, Barbara Streisand's performance fee, Jon Williams'
<BR>
movie soundtrack fee, and the total revenues from Back Street
<BR>
Boys' merchandise.
<BR>
<P>I'll anticipate a few possible counter-arguments:
<BR>
<P>- &quot;Those methods won't work/won't make enough money&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll make different people different amounts of money, that's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;true.  I am indeed proposing a major change in the laws, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that will affect a lot of people; some worse, some better.  But
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the same can be said of any change in law or technology.  Some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people will be better off and some worse.  Machines put a lot of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people out of work, as does ending a subsidy program.  But the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;benefits to the economy and society as a whole weigh strongly in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;favor of ending subsidies and automating production.  For every
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one put out of work, two or three get hired in other jobs by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;new expanded economy.  The benefits to the economy and society
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as a whole of totally unfettering all communication of information
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't even begin to calculate, but I can't imagine a greater
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;single thing we could do to encorage development of culture and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;technology.
<BR>
<P>- &quot;Artists shouldn't sell out&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tough.  Snobbery costs money.  If you don't want to do what it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;takes to earn money in the free market, you deserve to starve.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a free market, money is earned, by definition, by doing things
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;/other/ people want, and will pay for.  Some of us are lucky
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to do things we also enjoy doing, but that's a luxury.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People want music around, so they will figure out ways to get it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and ways to pay for it.  But if that way is to offer a songwriter
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;money to do a commercial, and ey turns the offer down, ey has no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;right to complain that ey is poor, or that ey can't make enough
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;money doing what ey wants.
