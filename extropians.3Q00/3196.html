<EM>&gt; &gt;Being an unreconstructed aerospace nut (and spending way too much time on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;airplanes), I've followed the Concorde crash story with morbid fascination.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then you would probably find the following site of interest:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt; <A HREF="http://www.airdisaster.com">http://www.airdisaster.com</A> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>The recommended site was enormously informative, Zero, and
<BR>
I thank you.
<BR>
<P>Greg -- I share your fascination although I don't perceive it as
<BR>
morbid. I've no interest whatever in other types of transport
<BR>
disaster, or in generic disaster scenarios of any kind. It's true
<BR>
that &quot;nuts&quot; tend to have &quot;morbid&quot; interests, but I would describe
<BR>
myself as &quot;an unreconstructed aerospace fanatic&quot; so that my
<BR>
attention, while socially borderline, is otherwise asymptomatic.
<BR>
Seriously -- how do you interpret this specific interest?
<BR>
<P>And while I've got you on the line, Greg, please appreciate that
<BR>
I DO regard serotonin reuptake neuropathy as correlated with
<BR>
suicide, or an apathy sufficiently profound to justify a diagnosis
<BR>
of &quot;quasi-neonatal failure to thrive&quot; You see, we really have no
<BR>
category for this illness [c.f. involutional melancholia] and I
<BR>
regard the word &quot;depression&quot; as a metaphor rather than a
<BR>
satisfactory diagnostic category, supposing that phrases such
<BR>
as &quot;neurochemically induced mood disorder&quot; [in endogenetic
<BR>
cases] not only more accurate, but less prejudicial. One may
<BR>
consider this disorder as analogous to diabetes, either of
<BR>
which may or may not contribute to the death of an otherwise
<BR>
viable person.
<BR>
<P>My regards,
<BR>
<P>Bob

<P>------------------
<BR>
<P>I think Concorde can in some way be compared to the SR-71.  Two unique
<BR>
highspeed aircraft that will never be replaced, each have millions wanting
<BR>
or wanted them scraped, each are an excellent demonstration of what brains
<BR>
can achieve when you want them to!
<BR>
<P>As Kelly Johnson once said (wearing a very dodgy plaid jacket!) &quot;It'll be a
<BR>
long long time before they make another airplane that goes faster and higher
<BR>
then the SR-71&quot;  He said that in the 70s and its still true!!!!
<BR>
<P>-------------------
<BR>
<P>Provided we have enough brain-power and sufficient resources we can accomplish
<BR>
almost anything we set our minds to. If we wanted to we could develop a quiet 
<BR>
and economical SST to replace the Concorde and possibly many subsonic 
<BR>
transports. However, it is not in the industry's interest to do so, especially 
<BR>
given the huge investment they would have to make which would be considered very 
<BR>
risky and thus unprofitable. This aversion to risk has already been devastating
<BR>
in some respects. Our inability or unwilingness to innovate will come back to 
<BR>
haunt us some day.

<P>--------------------
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&gt; Despite having suffered through a transatlantic flight more times than I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can now count, I can't make myself believe that an SST with current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology makes sense.  It seems to me that the disruption of one's schedule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from crossing 6 or 8 time zones in 3 or 4 hours is just as great as doing it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in 9 or 10 hours.  Heck, just going back and forth between the US Middle and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Left Coasts is enough to kill the better part of two whole days for me.  With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the ability to keep a laptop computer running throughout the usable portion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the transatlantic flight now, I've come to actually be able to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; productive use of the trip if I want or need to.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I've read many businesspeople coming from Europe take the Concorde
<BR>
over (arriving in US around same time of day that they left), do their
<BR>
biz here, and then grab a normal slower flight back to sleep on. In that
<BR>
case I can see that it makes sense.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>According to this article America is not soooo unwilling to pursue new
<BR>
technologies
<BR>
in that field...

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMERICAS X-PLANES
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Christopher Hess
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other aircraft program illustrates the USA's strong will for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leadership in aerospace technology better than the X-Planes. In more
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than 50 years since the first supersonic flight of the Bell X-1, the X
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;designation aircraft have become the technological spearhead in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developing new aircraft and spacecraft.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including a few classified projects there are currently 12 active or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planned X programms which will fly in the medium term. However,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this number includes single projects, such as Boeing's or Lockheed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's Joint Strike Fighter prototypes (X-32 and X-35) which are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not X-Planes in the classical sense of technology driven experimental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vehicles.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X programm was initiated at the end of the Second World War as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a joint effort from NASA (back then NACA, National Advisory
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee for Aeronautics) and the US forces. The goal of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project was the exploration of the back then still unexplored speed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region of high subsonic (transsonic) and low supersonic.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier on 14 October 1947,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such accomplishing the near-term program goals, the flight
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiments did not stop but were intensified. Most interestingly the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;original XS aircraft designation (for eXperimental Supersonic) was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changed into X already at the very beginning of the program.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continous research of supersonic flight gave the Americans an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immense Knowledge about the flight in the high-speed region,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cumulating in the X-15 that reached a speed of more than six times the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed of sound and an altitude of more than 100 km.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This high-speed research was only the beginning. In the past 50 years,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most different aircraft configurations were tested under the X
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;designation. The spectrum reaches from a tailsitting vertical lift-off
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plane via a nuclear powered bomber and a gyro copter to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spaceplane of the future. Engines used in the projects include jet,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;propeller and rocket motors.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the role of the X-planes has changed significantly. While at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the beginning their purpose was mainly to give the US a technological
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lead (especially in the military aircraft sector), today's experimental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aircraft must have a commercial perspective as far as the potential
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;application of the tested technology is concerned. There is an obvious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shift from aviation to spaceflight in the research activities.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The USA see a big market potential in spaceflight. But in order to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exploit that market, the cost of transportation must be reduced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;considerably. However, the necessary technologies are not yet or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only little tested. Here, the industry needs support to take the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technological risk. This is the part the X-Planes must play today.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA has developed the Future-X concept in the frame of its Space
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation Program. According to this concept, new technologies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are tested with demonstrator vehicles in two classes. First the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pathfinder class vehicles which are focus on a very narrow
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology. Accordingly, these demonstrators are designed for a very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short development time of less than two years from program start to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flight tests. Also, the program costs should be less than 100 million
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dollars.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example for such a pathfinder technology demonstrator is the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X-34 which is currently undergoing integration tests with its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lockheed TriStar launch aircraft at NASA's Dryden Flight Research
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Center. The X-34 is supposed to start suborbital flights next year,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reaching Mach 8. The technologies to be demonstrated include an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autonomous flight control and landing system, as well as, an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integrated health monitoring system that is supposed to allow quick
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turnarounds between flights.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the pathfinders are focusing on specific technologies, larger
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vehicles, the so called trailblazers, will be used to validate the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integration of various technologies and systems. These experimental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrators almost look like the real vehicles. For example, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X-33 is a half-scale VentureStar which Lockheed projects as one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible successor of the Space Shuttle. The X-33 already features
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several design components of the VentureStar, such as new
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerospike rocket engines and a metal thermal protection system.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this approach, NASA together with the industry is making its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way towards the next generation of new space transportation systems.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also includes cost-sharing aspects of industry and government.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Europe has recognized the new X-attitude of the USA.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its Future Launchers Technologies Programme, which includes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small and large technology demonstrators, the European Space
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agency wants to create a technological basis for a competitive and at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least partially reusable space transporter.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From page 12 of FLUG REVUE 11/99
<BR>
<P><P>----------------------
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&gt; I understand why the engines have to be in closed nacelles tucked in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tightly to the body and wing, but why not on TOP of the wing, where debris
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from an exploding tire wouldn't be a problem?
</EM><BR>
<P>A few reasons come to mind.  The intake has access to less turbulent
<BR>
air {and so higher pressure} if they are below the wing, and secondly
<BR>
having the engines above the wing would raise the center of gravity, which
<BR>
is bad for stability.  Further, if the center of thrust were above the center
<BR>
of pressure, then getting on the gas would push the nose down instead
<BR>
of up.  The way it is, a pilot can control the aircraft in a hydraulics-out
<BR>
sitch to a certain extent as was demonstrated by the pilot in the Sioux City
<BR>
crash a few years ago.
<BR>
<P>The high mounted engines would still be vulnerable to exploding tires,
<BR>
perhaps less so.  Rubber frags would be thrown forward and ingested by
<BR>
the screaming engines on takeoff.
<BR>
spike
<BR>
<P>-------------------
<BR>
<P>My question is this:
<BR>
<P>Repeated news reports talk about the Concorde having difficulties
<BR>
with tires exploding on landing gear.
<BR>
<P>Military aircraft, the SR-71 in particular are considerably smaller
<BR>
than the Concorde but travel in similar regimes.
<BR>
<P>So why would the Concorde have tire difficulty and you never hear
<BR>
about tire problems on other supersonic aircraft.  Yes, they are
<BR>
smaller but you get the idea.  Since the Concorde is a civilian 
<BR>
airliner perhaps it's more noted.  Most military craft don't 
<BR>
report to the media that there were issues.
<BR>
<P>The news this morning discussed a &quot;cow catcher&quot; on the landing 
<BR>
gear coming loose, puncturing the fuel tank thus causing a leak
<BR>
and thus the fire..  Big ouch but it also appears that the British
<BR>
saw an issue with this and devices a leash to keep the catcher 
<BR>
affixed to the landing gear in the event it did come loose, a novel
<BR>
idea but one the french evidently didn't adopt.
<BR>
<P>I read Dan Zinngrabe's excellent article on Brilliant Buzzard on 
<BR>
his old website and it talked about very large aircraft having 
<BR>
landing gear requirements where manufacturers didn't want to have
<BR>
to re-invent the wheel if they didn't have to, thus re-using
<BR>
landing gear designs for other aircraft.   
<BR>
<P>I'm curious if indeed the Concorde used an existing design or
<BR>
if it was unique to that aircraft.  Might be an interesting read
<BR>
even though it's off-topic.  
<BR>
<P>Thoughts?
<BR>
<P>-------------------
<BR>
<P>You cannot compare military and civilian aircraft like that.
<BR>
As I understand it, the Concorde's flaw has to do with the placement of the 
<BR>
landing gear in front of the engines. In the event a tire explodes, debris from 
<BR>
the explosion will end up puncturing the skin and or being ingested by the 
<BR>
engines, causing FOD (foreign object damage) and possibly disabling one or more 
<BR>
engines, which is what apparently happened in this case.
<BR>
<P>In the SR-71's case the engine intakes are far away from the landing gear and 
<BR>
the gear is aft of the engines anyway (the engines are rooted in the wings).
<BR>
<P>In most military aircraft the landing gear is well aft of the engine intakes or 
<BR>
is placed far enough to the port or starboard of the intakes so that it does not 
<BR>
pose a risk to the engines or any critical parts of the airframe.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; So why would the Concorde have tire difficulty and you never hear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about tire problems on other supersonic aircraft.  Yes, they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smaller but you get the idea.  Since the Concorde is a civilian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; airliner perhaps it's more noted.  Most military craft don't

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes, it is quite possible.
<BR>

</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; landing gear designs for other aircraft.   
</EM><BR>
<P><P>It is common practice to re-use existing landing gear assemblies on new designs.
<BR>
However this does not necessarily impact the placement of those assemblies on 
<BR>
the airframe (placement is usually impacted by other factors such as 
<BR>
load-factors and balance and center of gravity issues).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm curious if indeed the Concorde used an existing design or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if it was unique to that aircraft.  Might be an interesting read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even though it's off-topic.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't know if they used an existing design or whether they designed one from 
<BR>
scratch, although I suspect they may have done so, since the Concorde &quot;probably&quot; 
<BR>
had rather unique requirements.
<BR>
<P>Sam
<BR>
<P>------------------
<BR>
<P>I couldn't tell from the video or front shot with at 
<BR>
least 1 engine on fire where the main landing gear was
<BR>
in relation to the nacelle's inlets.  It did seem like
<BR>
they &quot;about even&quot; with each other so if an engine blew
<BR>
some pieces out some might hit the tires.  I believe it
<BR>
is more likely that tire blowouts would have an
<BR>
unfortunately good chance of being ingested by the
<BR>
innermost engine or both.
<BR>
<P>Also I didn't know that the Concorde takes off at
<BR>
250mph!!!  That's pretty damn fast!  I believe the
<BR>
SR-71's usually rotated near 150 mph and got airborne
<BR>
before reaching 200 mph.  It's tires are pretty tough
<BR>
but someone mentioned that new tires are put on after
<BR>
10 flights...or sooner if major wear &quot;flat spots&quot; are
<BR>
discovered.  I have read that if one SR-71 main tires
<BR>
fails, the other 2 will fail also because the loads
<BR>
are too high for just 2 tires.  And usually the plane
<BR>
just grinds down the wheels and starts on the struts
<BR>
next!!  I believe these tires, which are very expensive,
<BR>
are rated for a maximum of 249 mph.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the SR-71's case the engine intakes are far away from the landing gear and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the gear is aft of the engines anyway (the engines are rooted in the wings).

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; report to the media that there were issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps not or maybe only in local newspapers.  I get
<BR>
most of my info from various books and info that is
<BR>
posted here.  I don't remember reading much about tire
<BR>
failure on the Concordes before the recent crash but
<BR>
I recall tv reports and articles about a Concorde that
<BR>
lost a major portion of the tailfin/rudder.  I thought
<BR>
that was attributed to the crew trying to set a speed
<BR>
record..
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
..snip...
<BR>
<P>---------------------
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also worthy of note that the Concordes have a shield on the gear that 
<BR>
is used to keep spray from being ingested.  The British experienced a problem 
<BR>
with the original design shredding and flying up and impacting the fuel tanks 
<BR>
and other areas.  They modified all of their Concordes and the problem has not 
<BR>
reoccurred.  Although they had the same data, the French chose not to perform 
<BR>
the modification on their Concordes.  Parts of the shield, as well as tires 
<BR>
were found on the runway...
<BR>
<P>---------------------
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ja, well Lockheed kicked Boeing butt that time.  Of course, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kicked ours in the 747 vs L1011 contest...  {8-[  spike

<EM>&gt; coach seats had was incredible (wide seats too).
</EM><BR>
<P>Mine too.  Even my modern standards it is a very comfortable aircraft
<BR>
for the long haul.  If you want an interesting discussion of the L1011
<BR>
vs its real competitor the Douglas DC 10, Ben Rich discusses it in his
<BR>
book Skunk Works.  The DC10 had the straight thru tail engine, which
<BR>
forced the rudder to be shorter, which required the wing engines to
<BR>
be closer inboard so that in a one-engine-out condition, the shorter
<BR>
rudder could overcome the resultant yaw.  The L1011 had the more
<BR>
expensive and complicated (Lockheed loves to do things this way
<BR>
whenever possible) S-shaped thrust duct, allowing a longer rudder,
<BR>
allowing the wing engines to be further outboard, so the passenger
<BR>
compartment is quieter.  The company calculated it would need to
<BR>
sell 250 of the 1011s to break even, and it sold 246 if memory
<BR>
serves correctly.  spike

<P>------------------
<BR>
<P>Robin sez:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I do have a lot of concern that the media tends to grab extremely firmly onto the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong ends of sticks and then worries it to death while the real story gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; submerged in the mire of obfuscation. Regarding Concorde, at the moment 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is no real confirmation of anything and there won't be at least until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Accident Investigation Board (AIB) has presented its findings. There's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a huge amount of information to examine before the actual cause of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accident can be proposed. In the meantime a fine aircraft with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previously excellent safety record is being tarred with accusations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it (and by association civil aviation in general) is fundamentally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unsafe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eyewitness accounts are notoriously inaccurate - the existence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of photographs and video of the event are powerful pieces of evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the accident investigation, but they are only symptoms of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accident, they do not usually point unequivocably at the actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cause. In this incident, the engines, in particular a rotor failure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was implicated - Rolls Royce would naturally be alarmed to find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the incident was blamed on their engines, from design to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacture and maintenance thereof. Ditto the thrust reverser,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problems with which were hilighted immediately before flight. (The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggestion that the maintenance crew &quot;rushed&quot; the repairs -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implying that they did a botched job - does them a huge disservice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robbing components from a &quot;christmas tree&quot; aircraft is common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practice and is a perfectly reasonable way to maintain a small 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fleet of aircraft whose spares are in limited supply.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The video and photographs have mostly put paid to the engine failure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  theory in showing that the fire appears to originate from the undercarriage 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bay, which is why the blame has shifted to a tyre-burst that has thrown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debris into the bay, puncturing fuel tanks and severing control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lines and triggering a fire away from the engine. This still doesn't mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the engine is entirely off the hook, and it will be examined as if still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a suspect just to make sure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even so, this doesn't actually identify the trigger for the accident, whatever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caused the tyre to fail in the first place, so we turn to examining such things as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the brakes. Concorde travelled two-and-a-half miles from the terminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building to the end of the runway - a binding brake would have caused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it to overheat. The heat takes a finite time to soak through into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wheel and wheel hub, the wheel and tyre overheating could cause a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failure of the tyre, which could have happened as the aircraft began
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's take-off roll applying the final amount of strain to an already overloaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tyre. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But (and it's a Big But) this is still all conjecture until the wheels, hubs and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brakes are recovered and examined, and it still doesn't explain why the tyre failed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when it did - aircraft tyres are expensive and undergo re-tread procedures. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cocncorde tyres are different from conventional civil aircraft tyres, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; markedly so. BA inspects after so many landings and allows (AFAIR) 8 retreads 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before scrapping  the tyres, AF performs a post-landing check after every flight 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and allows 15 re-treads (again, AFAIR - may have to check the actual figures, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it does represent a slightly different approach to tyre inspections by the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two companies.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are also different modification states to the undercarriages between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; two companies - BA have debris deflectors on their main u/cs, AF do not,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; despite there being a history of tyre failures on Concordes. The deflectors are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mainly there to protect the engines from ingestion of debris that causes foreign 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object damage (FOD) - in the case of the AF Concorde this may (note &quot;may&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have penetrated fuel tanks and service lines as well, as indicated by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pilot reporting the inability to raise the undercarriage and the roll stability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control problem (basically, it appears he only had control of the starboard side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the aircraft). This is *still* all conjecture until the control systems and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can be examined.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is also possible that Concorde ran over debris on the runway, which may have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damaged the tyre. This has implications for the operations procedures for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the airport itself. Again, all conjecture, but may have contributed to the incident.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It takes a long time to properly inspect and sweep a runway, and day-time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operations mean that it cannot be performed until the evening, or even at night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when the airport is quiet. Things can be missed, especially when you're more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerned with checking a runway when the debris might be on a taxiway or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the terminal apron. Aircraft safety is down to everybody involved, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just the designers, builders and operators!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It could even be something as simple as a flat-spot on a tyre caused by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accidental heavy braking, in which case the *actual* cause of the accident may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never be known. The fact that it is possible to check almost every other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cause is testament to how thorough the AIB's job has to be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Aircraft designers, manufacturers and operators do not fear the results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of an AIB. While we hope that they are never needed, when they are their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; findings contribute to the ever-expanding sphere of knowledge as to how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all machines (not just aircraft) function in adverse conditions. Hazard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evaluation is part of the safety analysis that is performed as part of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design of a new product. We need to find the actual causes of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incidents so we can protect against them happening again. We need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to find the real causes so we don't mislead ourselves into thinking that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we've fixed the problem when we might have made it worse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oops. Sorry. It's turned into a bit of a thesis. Hope this helps, illuminates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many thanks,
