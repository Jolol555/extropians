<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure that I agree that the hardware will need to be all that

special
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; purpose. You're basically looking at massive massively parallel
</EM><BR>
hardware,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which has got to be where hardware is heading in any case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not completely true.  Programming massive parallelism is not a mainstream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; application.  Human minds can't think that way so writing the software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is very difficult.  I would argue massive parallelism will remain a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special purpose application where it is almost always designed as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a model or simulation of some real world process (weather, buckytube
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bending, protein folding, etc.).  Either that or it will be parallelism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for doing identical stuff in multi-threads (e.g. web serving).
</EM><BR>
<P>The kinds of parallel applications which require true parallel
<BR>
architectures, rather than distributed computing (the latter being where Web
<BR>
servers, dbms's and the like tend to fall), will become more mainstream I
<BR>
think. For example, complex sims of real world behaviour are all going to
<BR>
need parallel architecture. Well, that's not entirely true; you can simulate
<BR>
parallelism on a sequential machine, but such applications will always run
<BR>
faster on an appropriately designed parallel machine; and speed is always
<BR>
the issue.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While general purpose hardware can simulate neural nets, to get to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real time or faster time scales that Robin requires, it has to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; special purpose (at least currently).  Ultimately it isn't computation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the brain is good at, it is evolving clever interconnects.  Almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *all* current hardware devices (transistors, FETs, etc) and communications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protocols are not optimal for brain architectures.  You need to change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1-to-1, 1 to few or 1-to-many strategies into many-to-many.  As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interconnected as the entire WWW is today it is still much less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a single human brain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Is it more likely that we'll get far faster massively parallel systems
</EM><BR>
(at
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cheapish prices) first, or that we'll be able to conquer the problems of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; high bandwidth connections between human &amp; machine, an area of
</EM><BR>
technology
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that could barely be said to have hatched?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We will have special purpose massively parallel systems (I would love
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to know what IBM thinks the market for Blue Gene is).  I suspect they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will not be particularly cheap (they have to sell 200 @ $1 million each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to recover their investment at a decent profit).  We will start with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; low bandwidth human-machine communications (think of the retraining you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do to scribble on a palm-pilot) that will jump significantly when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes feasible to implant devices into which neurons can grow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are linked to exo-GHz transceivers (think cell-phone or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Borgian exohardware).  With human &quot;eye&quot; &quot;input&quot; and an equivalent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optic-nerve sized &quot;output&quot;, you have the foundation for high bandwidth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; links.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So I see them both developing on separate paths, but the market size
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the massively parallel hardware is likely to be much smaller than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market for high bandwidth exolinks.  I can't win at Tetris anymore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the keyboard will not respond as fast as I can think.  Think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the protein folding market vs. the game playing market.
