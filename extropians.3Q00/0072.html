<P><EM>&gt;That's fine if you believe that [compulsory taxation in support of the

<BR>
<EM>&gt;- but what if you didn't believe it? 
</EM><BR>
<P>What if you don't believe in immunisation or fluoridation, or reading and
<BR>
writing, for your own children? This is obviously a highly vexed question,
<BR>
and I suppose most people here would fight to the death to allow a fellow
<BR>
citizen to keep her child as susceptible to disease and caries as possible,
<BR>
though possible not illiterate. I don't even know what my own opinion is -
<BR>
I suspect some kind of implicit `social contract' theory might kick in, in
<BR>
which, naturally, communal reinterpretation of the terms of the contract
<BR>
should be an on-going process. Humans are critters selected to live in
<BR>
*groups*, however individualistic we might be. The very language we use to
<BR>
debate such issues is a collective construct, not an idiographic one
<BR>
(however much playful wordsters like me might deform it).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should you be forced to contribute to that system? Why not have an option
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to not contribute and also be denied access to it? 
</EM><BR>
<P>In Oz, people who choose to send their kids to church or other private
<BR>
schools get a chunk of their tax money back in grants to those schools. Is
<BR>
it equal to the amount they pay? I don't know - possibly in toto it is,
<BR>
since it's mostly Catholics who support private church schools and they
<BR>
tend not to be the wealthy in Australia. On the other hand, the whole
<BR>
theory of the thing is that those who get side benefits of the system (all
<BR>
of us; the childless as well as the fecund, etc) also have to pay, just as
<BR>
law-abiding citizens shell out for the incarceration of criminals; it's
<BR>
presumably deemed a happier outcome than letting them run loose.
<BR>
<P>None of this is meant to suggest that there isn't `a Better Way'. But it
<BR>
does argue that this way of thinking about governance isn't `idiotic' or
<BR>
evil, or any other similar epithet likely to be heard in this forum.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It's like the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has chosen a religion for you, and you have no choice but to worship it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had the strong impression that in the States sanctimonious Xianity
<BR>
approaches that condition. :)
