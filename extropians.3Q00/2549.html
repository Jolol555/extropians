Re: Guns

I made a gun to fire a solder bullet from a firecracker. If those people who are want to harm others will find a way. Guns should;d be kept from the general public contrary to the right to bear arms. Guns do one thing very well: take lives. Guns should be abolished.

<P>Ed Case is a neophyte here who has reached out in what I considered a sincere way to Natasha, Max and others in regards to trying to quit bad health habits.  I was one of the people who gave a little advice and wished him well.
<BR>
<P>I think Ed may have been under the heavy influence of alcohol when he posted this.  I myself try to avoid posting when drunk out of my mind(just kidding)!!  
<BR>
<P>Or someone may be posting in his name as a stupid prank.  This is also a possibility we must keep in mind.  Things like that have certainly happened before.
<BR>
<P>I can understand some of Ed's sentiment here.  But in the world we live in I would not feel comfortable having the citizenry disarmed.  A whole planet disarmed would be cool but that is just not a realistic option...
<BR>
<P>Anyway, perhaps Ed Case will explain things later on.  I look forward to seeing what he will have to say.
<BR>
