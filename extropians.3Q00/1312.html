In the face of recent news, its sometimes hard to be optimistic.
<BR>
Whatever happened to private e-cash?  You know, that thing that was
<BR>
promoted optimistically within extropian circles.  It seems everyone who
<BR>
tried it folded up.  Worse still, people like the Dept of the Treasury,
<BR>
IRS, World Bank and others are actively attempting to prohibit its use.
<BR>
But even it were legal, most organizations capable of implementing it
<BR>
have no interest in doing so - like Visa, MC, American Express.  They
<BR>
would rather our transactions remain open to scrutiny for marketing
<BR>
purposes.  The government wants money to remain in their control for the
<BR>
ostensible purpose of tracking drug traffickers, money launders and
<BR>
terrorists.  Also recent legislation is passing through congress to
<BR>
re-enact the &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; plan for international transactions.
<BR>
The problem here, is once the system is in place to track that, its
<BR>
becomes that much easier for them to implement it domestically.
<BR>
<P>The problem  I see ultimately, is this allows the governments of the
<BR>
world to continue increasing their power at the expense of individual
<BR>
liberty.  Previous talk about how network economics would ultimately
<BR>
circumvent the state and render it powerless have failed to materialize
<BR>
at least in the US.  Perhaps this occurred on the scale of large
<BR>
corporations, but again this seems to have happened at the expense of
<BR>
individual liberty.
<BR>
<P>Of course some people will say &quot;Hey, now we have HavenCo&quot;.  But just the
<BR>
other day, one of its chief engineers was barred from entering the UK.
<BR>
I'm not optimistic this company will last very long.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I'm missing the big picture here.  Does anybody think overall
<BR>
individual liberty is increasing, particularly for US Citizens, or
<BR>
decreasing?  Please be as specific as possible.
