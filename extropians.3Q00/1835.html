<P>Yes, and converting a reasonable amount of agricultural land from

something like ~1% NatAg sunlight gatherers into ~30%+ nanotech

sunlight gatherers will leave a large amount available for

<P>Spike is correct.  Nanotech even more so.  Of course convincing
<BR>
people of that is the interesting problem.  I always wonder what
<BR>
the greens say when you say: &quot;Let me get this straight -- do you want
<BR>
to return the the planet to a wild state where dog-eat-dog is the
<BR>
dominant condition, i.e. where carnivores are ripping out the throats
<BR>
or entrails of their prey, allowing them to die relatively unpleasantly?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Techno-man has done a majority of species a favor by eliminating
<BR>
other predators and confining his predation to a limited set of
<BR>
animals which, *in theory*, are sacrificed with a minimal amount
<BR>
of suffering (though I'd *definately* prefer that all meat be
<BR>
grown in a vat).
