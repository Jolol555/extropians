<P>There are several additional problems that have to be solved.  The first
<BR>
is to have a good, nearly complete understanding of the dynamics of the
<BR>
brain.  Just knowing the shapes and positions of the neurons won't do you
<BR>
any good unless you know how the operate and how they change over time.
<BR>
We are still very far from understanding this area.
<BR>
<P>The second is the ethical problem of making sure it will work before
<BR>
killing a human being to try it.  This means that you will have to
<BR>
do work with animals first, and show that they are able to operate in
<BR>
uploaded form, and are not in distress.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, with animals it will be more difficult to come up with
<BR>
good tests for how well they function, until we are able to provide them
<BR>
with a relatively realistic simulated body and world to interact with.
<BR>
We can't just ask, are you okay.  We have to watch the uploaded rats
<BR>
running simulated mazes, eating simulated food, and so on.
<BR>
<P>As a result, it will be necessary to have a relatively mature simulation
<BR>
capability that goes beyond just running the brain.  The simulation will
<BR>
have to include the body and the environment, and will have to be complete
<BR>
enough that an animal can adapt to whatever differences are encountered,
<BR>
which means that it probably has to be pretty close to reality.
<BR>
<P>Also, Billy did some calculations a while back, and a low level neural
<BR>
simulation (as you'd presumably require, working with raw brain slices)
<BR>
requires more computing power than will be feasibly available in a
<BR>
non-nanotech world.
<BR>
<P>For these reasons I think there is a lot more to the problem than just
<BR>
being able to read out the brain and fit it into memory.
