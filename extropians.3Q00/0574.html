<P>If you are looking for short term, &quot;what do I do to change my life
<BR>
*right now*&quot; type of answers, you might not find them here.
<BR>
Transhumanism will not be achieved overnight.
<BR>
<P>However, there are always points in your life where you can make
<BR>
long-term decisions.  For instance, you are a businessman taking care of
<BR>
a store.  What products do you sell?  If you are interested in
<BR>
promoting the vision discussed here, perhaps you could add some of the
<BR>
types of products discussed here to your wares.
<BR>
<P>For instance: if you sell computer goods, perhaps you could add
<BR>
Xybernaut's stuff to your lineup, to introduce more people to the
<BR>
concept.  Ask here for ideas on the uses of augmented reality, so you
<BR>
can answer your customers when they ask why they would want to buy this
<BR>
gear.  (And, en route, make money for yourself: the relative scarcity of
<BR>
people selling these goods may give you a near-monopoly, at least in the
<BR>
short term, for local supply.  Your market has been created by legions
<BR>
of science fiction writers and others...but not that many have yet
<BR>
thought to actually serve it.)
<BR>
<P>Mining for ideas is perhaps the best way you can take advantage of
<BR>
transhumanism.  Whether you are one yourself depends on your personal
<BR>
point of view - but there is a difference between being part of a group,
<BR>
and getting benefit out of using what the group supplies freely.
