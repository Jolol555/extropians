Chris Heward spoke about this idea back at Extro-1 and Extro-2, and it has recently become the Kronos Group, based in Arizona, but with clinics planned to open in many cities. The program involves a full day of testing of numerous physiological functions, and then carefully personalized recommendations. They do not want to be described as a &quot;life extension&quot; group, but as involved in &quot;age management&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>Natasha and I will be going through the program next month. They will do a follow-up in six months, and then I think once a year. I'll be happy to report on my experience there in about a month.
<BR>
<P>Their web site is:

<P>I read over the website and found it fascinating to say the least.  I thought they had a very realisitic attitude toward managing aging in terms of it being inevitable(for now).  And yet making it a somewhat controlled process by personalizing a program to slow it and avoid debilitating diseases.  This organization is an idea whose idea has come.  
<BR>
<P>I can easily guess that the services of Kronos do not come cheap...  I am curious to know just how expensive they are.  These clinics will definitely be for those who have fought and succeeded in the economic arena.  Or at least had a wealthy mate/friend/relative who did and shared with them the bounty.  I wonder if even on a teacher's salary(should I ever graduate from college...) I could afford their services a decade from now?  I will than be an ancient forty-three year old.  
<BR>
<P>I was a little disturbed about the section of the website about executive fitness.  I can understand a corporation wanting to know the mental and physical fitness of their key employees but I could see this being abused.  &quot;Yep, this med report proves the old man is losing it, can him!&quot;
<BR>
<P>I really look forward to reading the accounts of you and Natasha visiting Kronos.  I would think both of you would get glowing bills of good health.  Or at least bills.. :)
<BR>
<P>best wishes,
<BR>
<P>John
<BR>
<P>P.S. At the rate cryonics research is going I definitely want both of you in this program! lol
