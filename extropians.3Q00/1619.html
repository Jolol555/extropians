</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to ram GMO down our throats whether we like it or not:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In 1999, genetically modified seeds designed to produce their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; insecticides or withstand powerful new herbicides comprised 57 percent of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's an updated quote for you: &quot;Science stops where politics [or marketing]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; begins.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My last post was labeled troll-work by someone who insisted I had no right to say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything until I had posted a certain (unspecified) number of posts first.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abrupt Catch-22 attack took me aback.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, I have something else to say.  If Catch-22 is still in effect, someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; else will have to set the server to delete my message.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been on the list for years, and I've NEVER heard of any such thing.
<BR>
Either you made it up or you deliberately misunderstood someones
<BR>
recommendation that you just listen for a while to get into the flow of
<BR>
the list.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question: are you folks familiar with the Bay of Mexico dead zone?  If not, here's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a basic reference...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.enn.com/enn-news-archive/1996/10/102196/feature.asp">http://www.enn.com/enn-news-archive/1996/10/102196/feature.asp</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now the article gives a simplistic &quot;nutrient overload&quot; view of the matter, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are those who look deeper.  And some of the better minds are wondering if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modern farming with its over-reliance on herbicides is causing problems much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bigger, and faster, than nature can clean them up.  I'm only using the &quot;Dead Zone&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as one illustration of non-thinking people pushing us into deep trouble.  There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are plenty more: the Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know many of you people are gizmo-heads and think technology is *the* answer for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything, but big-time messing with the environment can cause trouble that may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be impossible to back out of---emergency government funding to the contrary.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no *impossible*, only difficult, expensive, or time consuming.
<BR>
Tree huggers like you think something is *impossible* if the solution
<BR>
does not satisfy your &quot;I want it now&quot; spoiled brat baby boomer
<BR>
attitudes. Nature does heal. Its very good at it (just look at the Mt.
<BR>
St. Helens 'Dead Zone' for proof).
<BR>
<P>The anti-GMO side is ignorant to the extreme (hell, they can't even
<BR>
pronounce 'nuclear' right), their whole argument is based on ignorance,
<BR>
and a willful ignorance at that. Their science is pseudo-science of the
<BR>
worst sort, that any real scientist would laugh at as the product of a
<BR>
sixth grade student, with logical errors abounding and much unaccounted
<BR>
for evidence.
