<EM>&gt;I wish people would give a little more content than a URL, as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;makes it easier to talk about:
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, sorry about that.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    MOSCOW, July 5 -  His fashion sense isn't as elegant as Gucci's, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Roman Kunikov says his gasoline-powered boots are a step forward in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    footwear - as much as 13 feet per stride.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    KUNIKOV IS ONE of the professors at a Russian engineering institute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    who designed the boots that were tested Tuesday in a public square in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Ufa, 750 miles southeast of Moscow.  The test showed that wearers can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    achieve speeds of up to 25 mph, Kunikov said in a telephone interview.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The boots incorporate one-foot pistons that strap along the calf and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    fire downward after the wearer steps down, pushing a metal plate away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    from the bottom of the shoe - and the wearer up into the air.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The shoe works in a rhythm with the wearer's step. As he steps down,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    his body weight resets the piston, which then fires and pushes him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    on his way. The plate is connected to the sole of the shoe by metal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    rods that work as shock absorbers. The shoes use ordinary gasoline,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Kunikov said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These sound like fun, if they could be mass produced.  It would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great to be able to run along at 20+ mph with these pistons hurtling you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forward with each stride.  Imagine entering the local road race wearing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these things and running rings around the winners (of course your results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would not count).
</EM><BR>
<P>It kind of reminds me as an inspector gadget type contraption. When I read 
<BR>
it, the first thing that came to mind was someone like the joker using them 
<BR>
to run away from batman. Imagine the brutally comic things that could go 
<BR>
wrong, like landing on a poodle, or in a manhole.
<BR>
The best application - use them during a Lunar or Mars mission. You would 
<BR>
certainly be able to make more then 13 feet/stride in the low gravity 
<BR>
environment. You could fit several of them in the same volume as a rover, 
<BR>
and probably go almost as fast. You'd want to use something other then 
<BR>
gasoline - maybe hydrogen oxygen interaction. Is calcium/oxygen interaction 
<BR>
strong enough?
<BR>
You'd want to test them in a cratered, rock litered environment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Probably would never happen though, too hard to make them safe.
</EM><BR>
<P>The article said there has never been an accident.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Reading this reminded me of an old product from the 70s, the gasoline
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powered pogo stick.  Kind of a similar idea, each time you came down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;piston fires and shoots you back up.  Always sounded like a bumpy ride
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;though.
</EM><BR>
