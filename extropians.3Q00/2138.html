<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; You know Lee, here is a point I have never been satisfied with in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; Libertarian or free market approach. How is privately produced law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; enforcable?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  With guns, just like regular law.  How else?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; um... I supoose you are being sarcastic. Unless you are talking about some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; kind of paid gun for hire mafia or gangbanger hit squad.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I'm being as plain as I can be.  Isn't that what &quot;enforce&quot; means?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Isn't that exactly what a &quot;government&quot; is, a generally-agreed-upon
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun-for-hire?  Private protection systems will be no different--the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only difference is that there will be a market of competing ones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of a single monopoly.  If you wrong me, the agency I've hired
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to protect me will want to earn that fee by seizing you physically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and extracting whatever punishment its policies call for.  The agency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; /you've/ hired will want to prevent this, and the two will likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; negotiate a contract between themselves about how to settle the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dispute (which will probably involve arbitration by a private judge).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the end result is just the same as it is with a monopoly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government--eventually, whoever is judged wrong is seized physically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by armed agents and fined or jailed or whatever (in a private/civil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system, fines and property seziures will be more common than jail time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it is more economically efficient).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is all really basic stuff that's covered well by Friedman and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others, so I won't elaborate more.
</EM><BR>
<P>Friedman covers it all very well. I think though, that there will be far less
<BR>
outright force than Lee states, mostly likely only against those who try to O.J.
<BR>
and refuse to pay civil judgements. Private protection agencies will have
<BR>
agreements made between each other. There will likely be an industry association
<BR>
or two that have standards that all members must adhere to and require of their
<BR>
customers. Those individuals who don't like these standards could try to insure
<BR>
themselves through a 'fly-by-night' equivalent, which WOULD be goon-squad
<BR>
oriented, or else would 'go armadillo' where they are self insured.
<BR>
<P>There may be some market pressure for conglomeration of PPAs, but without
<BR>
government imposing barriers to entry, there will always be room for start-ups
<BR>
to gain customers who are dissastified with ACME Protection Racket, Inc.
