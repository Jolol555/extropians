<P>
Robert quotes the revised Amazon.com privacy policy:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amazon.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>He writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, I'd urge you all with Amazon accounts to write them a letter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; letting them know that you don't want to receive more unsolicited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mail if Amazon goes belly up.  My letter is attached below.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your letter asks for more than this, it asks for them to forget your
<BR>
name, your address, and your order history with them.  In effect they
<BR>
are supposed to wipe their books clean of all their customer information
<BR>
if they are ever acquired.
<BR>
<P>I don't think that is a reasonable request.  Much of a company's
<BR>
value comes from its customer base.  Whenever a company is acquired,
<BR>
it naturally brings along its customers.  When GTE (local phone company)
<BR>
merged with some others to become Verizon, should they have wiped their
<BR>
computers clean?  When paypal.com merged with x.com, should one of them
<BR>
have been compelled to erase knowledge of its customers' accounts?
<BR>
<P>This doesn't make sense to me.  I don't see what the concern is.
<BR>
<P>Hal
