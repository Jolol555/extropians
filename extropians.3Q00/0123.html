<P>Somatostatin: physiology and clinical applications.
<BR>
<P>Shulkes A
<BR>
<P>Department of Surgery, University of Melbourne, Austin Hospital, Victoria, 
<BR>
Australia.
<BR>
<P>Somatostatin (SOM) was originally isolated as the hypothalamic inhibitor of 
<BR>
growth hormone release but was subsequently shown to have a widespread 
<BR>
distribution including the gastrointestinal tract. In fact the 
<BR>
gastrointestinal tract contains about 70% of the total body SOM. SOM has 
<BR>
inhibitory actions on gastrointestinal exocrine and endocrine secretions, 
<BR>
motility and blood flow. Within the gut it functions as an endocrine, 
<BR>
paracrine, autocrine and neurocrine factor. SOM is released by a meal, and a 
<BR>
number of neurotransmitters and regulatory peptides also influence SOM 
<BR>
release. SOM is a key component of the gastrin-acid feedback loop as luminal 
<BR>
acid releases SOM, which in turn has inhibitory effects on both gastrin and 
<BR>
gastric acid. Consistent with the diverse functions of SOM, a number of 
<BR>
different although related SOM receptors with distinct distribution patterns 
<BR>
and intracellular mediators have been cloned and sequenced. SOM is the first 
<BR>
of the gut regulatory peptides to have a significant therapeutic use. By 
<BR>
inhibiting both the target cell (e.g. parietal cell) and the release of the 
<BR>
active agent (e.g. gastrin) the therapeutic potential of SOM is magnified.

<P>More specifically, somatostatin is also the feedback hormone which shuts 
down insulin release. Thus, it is possible that those taking an oral 
somatostatin inhibitor might suffer both gastritis and hyperinsulinemia.
<P><P><P><P><P>PHIL OSBORN SAID: &quot;...Thus, they utterly rejected out-of-hand any
arguments for the existence of a &quot;death gene,&quot; or &quot;aging clock.&quot;  Thus, no
research followup on Denkla's work...&quot;
<P>CYMM SAYS: Well the genes that regulate somatostatin come close to being a
&quot;death gene&quot;. Somatostatin which is upregulated as we grow older... has been
called &quot;enzymatic cyanide&quot;; it throws a spanner into almost any bochemical
works.
