Potatoes have already been designed to glow. (I tried to dig up the link in
<BR>
my Nanogirl news archives-result: impossible to locate) The green protein
<BR>
has been used as a marker in research for a long time, if you want to make a
<BR>
target protein fluorescent, you fuse the gene for the green protein to the
<BR>
gene for your target protein and you end up with a fluorescent target. (this
<BR>
green protein comes from a marine organism) This is of course on a smaller
<BR>
scale, but is now advancing to benefit the general population.
<BR>
As for as you stated &quot;those who fear an attract of killer tomatoes&quot;, I'm not
<BR>
sure what that means (tomato appeal?). But I did see the movie &quot;Attack of
<BR>
the Killer Tomatoes&quot; when I was a kid in the theater, and I wasn't truly
<BR>
frightened. As a matter of fact, I still appreciate, it's aloof, seedy,
<BR>
cheesy properties and have a link on my more serious (sarcasm) toons site.

<P><EM>&gt; I was wondering how long it would take for genetic engineering to move
</EM><BR>
into the area
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of ornamental plants and apparently it won't take long. A front page
</EM><BR>
article in today's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; New York Times says that in addition to developing a blue rose, the Scotts
</EM><BR>
Company
<BR>
<EM>&gt; has developed a grass that is drought resistant, immune to weed killer and
</EM><BR>
stops growing
<BR>
<EM>&gt; after it reaches a certain height so it needs little mowing. They have
</EM><BR>
even more ambitious
<BR>
<EM>&gt; plans, there is talk of red, orange, blue and purple grass, and Peter Day,
</EM><BR>
one of the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; company's scientists says: &quot; You might put a luminescent gene in so that
</EM><BR>
your grass might
<BR>
<EM>&gt; glow. Or, if your foot stepped on it , it would glow. You could also make
</EM><BR>
novelty grasses.&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; He didn't say what was more novel than glowing multicolored grass but I'd
</EM><BR>
love to find out.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jeremy Rifkin and others who fear an attract of killer tomatoes are
</EM><BR>
certain all this will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; bring an end to western civilization, they've already sabotaged some of
</EM><BR>
Scotts's test
<BR>
<EM>&gt; plots causing serious damage. Nevertheless my hope is that when people
</EM><BR>
start to bring
<BR>
<EM>&gt; beautiful plants into their home genetic engineering will shed its
</EM><BR>
fearsome image.
