<EM>&gt; &gt; The decision was certainly unjust and stupid, but I remind you it was

<EM>&gt;not made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; by a corporation, it was made by a judge appointed by a politician who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the job because of his white teeth, pleasant smile, and really nice 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;haircut.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So the question to you John, is what is your alternative?  Without the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;judge and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legal system and the Constitution, how would Eric Corley and the MPAA work 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;out their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;differences?  And in such a system, is there such a thing as free-speech? 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or is it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because the MPAA has more money than Eric Corley they decide what can be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;said and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what can't?  After all it was you who said that the *feature* of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free-markets is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such freedoms are open to the highest bidder.  Does this mean that that the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corporations who have the most money to purchase such commodities as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;free-speech,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mean that the rest of us loose that right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From where I'm sitting, you've painted yourself into a corner.  If you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can get out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this one, my hats will be off to you, as you will have successfully 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;answered all of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my reservations about free-markets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I eagerly await your answers, or anyone else who thinks they are up to it.

For purposes of maximum comprehension, it is probably useful to keep various 
<BR>
positions being expressed distinct and separate.  There are quite a few 
<BR>
&quot;anarchists&quot; who lean in the direction of saying that if we just eliminated 
<BR>
the state, then everything would take care of itself and we would reach 
<BR>
utopia.  To them, I pose the question, &quot;Why now?  Why not any of the ten 
<BR>
thousand times before when a state dissolved in ruin?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Somalia proved this past decade that even without any state at all people 
<BR>
are still capable of doing business and surviving - with fairly high 
<BR>
expenses in terms of hiring private guards, etc., but without crushing taxes 
<BR>
or stupid laws and bureaucrats.  However, this probably wouldn't have worked 
<BR>
where there were major historic ethnic animousities, as in former 
<BR>
Yugoslavia.
<BR>
<P>Most anarchists historically have made positive proposals as to the proper 
<BR>
organization of society.  Some of them have done rather well, at least until 
<BR>
stomped out of existence by overwhelming force - eg., the Spanish 
<BR>
anarcho-syndicalists (who have reemerged with the fabulously successful 
<BR>
Mondragon cooperative) or the Ukranian anarchists who came very close to 
<BR>
defeating the Bolsheviks in Russia.
<BR>
<P>As Spencer MacCallum points out in his seminal &quot;The Art of Community,&quot; the 
<BR>
state likely arose because of a lack of social/economic technology 
<BR>
sufficient to peacefully resolve disputes.  I would contend that we have 
<BR>
sufficient technology today to get rid of it.
