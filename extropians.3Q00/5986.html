Some excerpts from F.A. Hayek: _The Road to Serfdom_, 1944.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^

<P>(please note the date)
<BR>
<P>...quoting from the latest edition, 1994...
<BR>
<P>pg. 31
<BR>
In recent years, however, the old apprehensions of the unforeseen
<BR>
consequences of socialism have once more been strongly voiced from
<BR>
the most unexpected quarters. Observer after observer, in spite of
<BR>
the contrary expectation with which he approached his subject, has
<BR>
been impressed with the extraordinary similarity in many respects of
<BR>
the conditions under &quot;fascism&quot; and &quot;communism&quot;. While &quot;progressives&quot;
<BR>
in England and elsewhere were still deluding themselves that
<BR>
communism and fascism represented opposite poles, more and more
<BR>
people began to ask themselves whether these new tyrannies were not
<BR>
the outcome of the same tendencies. Even communists must have been
<BR>
somewhat shaken by such testimonies as that of Max Eastman, Lenin's
<BR>
old friend, who found himself compelled to admit that &quot;instead of
<BR>
being better, Stalinism is worse than fascism, more ruthless,
<BR>
barbarous, unjust, immoral, anti-democratic, and unredeemed by any
<BR>
hope or scruple,&quot; and that it is &quot;better described as superfascist&quot;;
<BR>
...
<BR>
pg. 32
<BR>
And Walter Lippman has arrived at the conviction that &quot;the
<BR>
generation to which we belong is now learning from experience what
<BR>
happens when men retreat from freedom to a coercive organization of
<BR>
their affairs. Though they promise themselves a more abundant life,
<BR>
they must in practice renounce it; as the organized direction
<BR>
increases, the variety of ends must give way to uniformity. That is
<BR>
the nemisis of the planned society and the authoritarian principle
<BR>
in human affairs.&quot; (Atlantic Monthly, November 1936, pg. 552)
<BR>
...
<BR>
pg. 34
<BR>
It is true, of course that in Germany before 1933, and in Italy
<BR>
before 1922, communists clashed more frequently with each other than
<BR>
with other parties. They competed for the support of the same type
<BR>
of mind and reserved for each other the hatred of the heretic. But
<BR>
their practice showed how closely they are related. To both, the
<BR>
real enemy, the man with whom they had nothing in common and whom
<BR>
they could not hope to convince, is the liberal of the old type.
<BR>
...
<BR>
pg. 39
<BR>
Planning owes its popularity largely to the fact that everybody
<BR>
desires, of course, that we should handle our common problems as
<BR>
rationally as possible and that, in so doing, we should use as much
<BR>
foresight as we can command. In this sense everybody who is not a
<BR>
complete fatalist is a planner, every political act is (or ought to
<BR>
be) an act of planning, and there can be differences only between
<BR>
good and bad, between wise and foresighted and foolish and
<BR>
shortsighted planning.  ... But it is not in this sense that our
<BR>
enthusiasts for a planned society now employ this term. ... What our
<BR>
planners demand is a central plan, laying down how the resources of
<BR>
society should be &quot;consciously directed&quot; to serve particular ends in
<BR>
a definite way.
<BR>
<P>The dispute between the modern planners and their opponents is *not*
<BR>
a dispute on whether we ought to choose intelligently betwen the
<BR>
various possible organizatons of society, *not* a dispute on whether
<BR>
we out to employ foresight and systematic thinking in planning our
<BR>
common affairs. It is a dispute about what is the best way of so
<BR>
doing. The question is whether for this purpose it is better that
<BR>
the holder of coercive power should confine himself in general to
<BR>
creating conditions under which the knowledge and initiative of
<BR>
individualsare given the best scope so that *they* can plan most
<BR>
successfully; or whether a rational of our resources requires
<BR>
*central* direction and organization of all of our activities
<BR>
according to some consciously constructed &quot;blueprint&quot;.

<P>This old classic _The Road to Serfdom_ should be on everyone's
bookshelf, IMO. It had more influence these last 10-30 years
in former-Soviet union and eastern Europe than any other
political treatise. (Ayn Rand's works never made it very far there.)
