J. R.
<BR>
<P>I am disappointed in your last post.  Not only is a patronizing in the
<BR>
extreme, but displays a level of rigid thinking that is practically
<BR>
anti-intellectual.  You're chastising me for questioning?
<BR>
<P>I've been remarkably patient with you throughout this conversation because I
<BR>
realize that we are approaching the problem from vastly different
<BR>
perspectives.  My patience is at an end.  I admit to being extraordinarily
<BR>
tempted to flame my way through your monotonous canticle, but despite
<BR>
evidence to the contrary, I have little love for such confrontation.  I am
<BR>
certain this little post will already throw all too much gas on that fire.
<BR>
<P>You seem to be purposefully blind to my arguments (you've repeatedly snipped
<BR>
all the core elements,) and you continue to make tautological arguments from
<BR>
authority.  You persist in interpreting my arguments in the context
<BR>
of -your- definitions, apparently not recognizing that I am talking about
<BR>
something else entirely.  The level at which you continue to come at this
<BR>
problem is obviously hard-wired.
<BR>
<P>... and I have little doubt that you are prepared to make an identical claim
<BR>
regarding my behaviour.
<BR>
<P>You appear to have taken on the role of the wise, illuminated authority
<BR>
figure here, and that is clear indication that rational conversation is
<BR>
OVER.  As fun as it would be to dissect your grumpy post at length, there
<BR>
would be little intellectual merit in it.
<BR>
<P>(Resist Jason, resist!)
<BR>
<P><P><P>I would like to apologize to list members for all the noise generated above.
<BR>
You might note that I have successfully slipped a few passing jabs into this
<BR>
post-- please believe that I am showing maximum restraint possible.  My mind
<BR>
is boggled.  (It really was a very small little mind to begin with.)
<BR>
<P><P>Thank you for the duel sir, it showed great merit, but ended messily.
<BR>

Subject: Re: One Reality
<P><P>&gt; Jason Joel Thompson indefatigably rejoined:
&gt; &gt; This is the false dichotomy I referred to earlier.
&gt;
&gt; Why do you call this equation a dichotomy?
&gt; Dichotomy means dividing in two parts.
&gt; The definition of reality as &quot;all that exists&quot; creates no dichotomy that I
can
&gt; detect.
&gt; Rather, it proclaims the unitary nature of reality.
&gt; If you imagine a dichotomy in this, then it is definitely a false
dichotomy, and
&gt; it is one that you have invented, not me.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; For instance, it's easy for me to say 'true' because the statement holds
no
&gt; &gt; meaning.  You're just switching titles-- instead of 'reality' you want
to
&gt; &gt; call it 'all that exists.'  Fine.
&gt;
&gt; No, I'm not switching titles, I'm offering the most concise definition of
&gt; reality that I can produce. If you think this amounts to switching titles
(or
&gt; more accurately, switching terms), then the dictionary is just a list of
&gt; switched terms.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Do I believe that there is only &quot;one&quot; 'all that exists?'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To me the statement is meaningless.  How can you apply 'oneness' to such
a
&gt; &gt; concept?
&gt;
&gt; In (very basic) mathematics it's known as defining a set. The set of all
that
&gt; exists is what is meant by the term reality. Since there is only one such
set in
&gt; existence, it becomes unavoidable to apply &quot;oneness&quot; to this concept.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The reason I challenged Elierzer's original statement was not that I was
&gt; &gt; saying, &quot;No, no, silly, there's actually SEVEN realities...&quot;  but rather
&gt; &gt; that I was questioning the concept of an absolute reality at all.
&gt;
&gt; OIC, so then it isn't that you disagree with the statement &quot;There is only
one
&gt; reality&quot; because you think there are multiple realities. You believe that
there
&gt; is no reality at all. But, you see, if there is no absolute reality, then
there
&gt; is no fact, state, or quality of being real or genuine, which is what
absolute
&gt; reality means. In that case, *you* are not real or genuine, and neither am
I.
&gt; So, in that case, you are not absolutely real and you do not absolutely
exist.
&gt; (This is elementary Cartesian logic.) I don't think your argument would
stand in
&gt; a court of law (or a court of common sense and reason, for that matter).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't see reality as a big, ubiquitous, tangible, static,
all-encompassing
&gt; &gt; absolute, but rather as a relative, interpretive, intangible, dynamic
&gt; &gt; interaction.
&gt;
&gt; I notice that you use the singular indefinite article (&quot;a&quot; instead of
&quot;some&quot;) to
&gt; refer to your &quot;relative, interpretive, intangible, dynamic interaction.&quot;
That
&gt; tends to indicate that you see it as ONE relative, interpretive,
intangible,
&gt; dynamic interaction. Which in turn reinforces the statement that there is
only
&gt; one reality.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It finds soldity as a mental contruct in the world of the
&gt; &gt; mind, but we cannot directly attribute greater 'existence' to it, as
yet,
&gt;
&gt; Again you use the singular &quot;it&quot; as if it is some absolute substance that
finds
&gt; solidity in the mind. Whatever &quot;it&quot; may be, it appears that you do,
indeed,
&gt; believe it absolutely deserves the attention you give to it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; J.R., I recognize where you're trying to go with this, and I understand
why
&gt; &gt; you accuse me of obstinancy.  You want reality to be the sum of all
sets-- I
&gt; &gt; get the feeling that you just want to shake me and say &quot;Yes, but
'reality'
&gt; &gt; includes that too!&quot;  What you have to understand is that I am
approaching
&gt; &gt; the problem from an entirely different direction.
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if you have any inkling of how sophomoric your position appears
to more
&gt; mature minds on this list who have already been where you're coming from,
and
&gt; who have done all of these exercises which seem so new and different to
you.
&gt; It's not simply a matter of accusing you of obstinacy. All you need to do
is
&gt; pick up a dictionary of the English language to ascertain that what people
mean
&gt; by the term reality is straightforward and plain, and everyone knows what
the
&gt; word means. I understand very well the direction from which you approach
this
&gt; subject. It is not a problem at all. What you need to understand is that
the
&gt; more you try to wiggle out of admitting that there is only one reality,
the
&gt; farther you run from the topic at hand.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; To me, belief in an external reality is the very human act of saying:
&gt; &gt; &quot;there -is- something out there real making all of this stuff happen.
We
&gt; &gt; can't directly see it yet, but we know it's there.&quot;  The belief system
has
&gt; &gt; passing similarities to a religion.  And, of course, the adherents say
that
&gt; &gt; they -can- see reality directly.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, puhleeeze! To refer to science and reason as a &quot;belief system&quot;
indicates a
&gt; level of hubris unbecoming of anyone who claims to have a hold on sanity.
Your
&gt; position reminds me of the Pope who refused to look through a telescope to
view
&gt; the moons of Jupiter on the grounds that whatever he might see there was
surely
&gt; the work of the devil.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; And, truth be told, I'm not even saying that those people are wrong.
&gt;
&gt; Oh, gee! Thank you *very* much! You're too generous.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; There
&gt; &gt; may very well be an external reality.  It certainly seems like there is.
I
&gt; &gt; agree that we should act like there is.  So, unlike religious belief,
belief
&gt; &gt; in reality has real, tangible, demonstrable benefits that accrue to all
&gt; &gt; believers.
&gt;
&gt; Wrong. Acceptance of reality (not &quot;belief in reality&quot;), is where you need
to
&gt; start if you are ever to attain a balanced and integrated perspective.
With
&gt; experience, I suspect you will someday learn to recognize and acknowledge
that
&gt; the people who have sent rockets to the Moon, and split the atom, and
discovered
&gt; DNA, and accurately measured the age of dinosaur fossils, are people who
accept
&gt; the existence of one (&quot;external&quot;) reality.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Essentially I have complete functional acceptance of the construct of
&gt; &gt; reality, but maintain mental skeptism.  Currently this has no impact on
my
&gt; &gt; life other than to make for interesting discussion.  Despite what you
were
&gt; &gt; hinting at earlier, this doesn't result in me swerving out in traffic.
&gt;
&gt; Glad to hear that. Of course, to have a &quot;construct of reality&quot; you have to
have
&gt; something to construct it with. That's what we call absolute reality. It's
real.
&gt; Get used to it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Can we agree to disagree now?
&gt;
&gt; No way! You must repeat after me:
&gt; &quot;There is only one reality.&quot;
&gt; Write it one hundred times every night before you go to bed.
&gt;
&gt; --J. R.
&gt;
&gt; There is a theory which states that if ever anybody discovers exactly what
the
&gt; Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be
replaced
&gt; by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory
which
&gt; states that this has already happened.
