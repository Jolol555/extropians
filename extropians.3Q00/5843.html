<P>I don't like laser sights for a couple of reasons:
<BR>
<P>1) like anything really technical, it's most likely to fail when
<BR>
you need it most.
<BR>
<P>2) It reveals your position and gives a sight vector back to you.
<BR>
<P>3) If you were to ever have to shoot someone, and they die, the
<BR>
relatives are likely to sue you under the guise that because you
<BR>
had a laser sight you should have been able to only wound them.
