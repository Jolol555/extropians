<EM>&gt; &gt; Standard economic theory and Paretian policy analysis is very general and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can speak to the future scenarios of interest to us.  It often, but far
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from always, supports the sort of policy conclusions that libertarians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; come to.  When they disagree, I tend to go with economic theory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;By itself economic theory cannot deliver a policy, as it is value neutral.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm not sure exactly what you mean by Paretian policy analysis ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;An economy lacks Pareto optimality if some people can be made better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;off without anyone being made worse.  This is a plausible candidate for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;providing policy guidance, but I suspect that it is weak in practice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Given the complexities of the world it will be hard to tweak a system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to make everyone better (or no worse) off.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps &quot;contractarian&quot; is a clearer descriptor.  When there is no
<BR>
uncertainty, it is usually relatively easy to figure out how to make
<BR>
everyone better off (from their subjective point of view).  And while there
<BR>
may be many ways to do this, they typically all have the same &quot;policy&quot; and
<BR>
differ only in who should transfer how much cash to who else in compensation.
<BR>
Economists are often willing to advocate that the policy be adopted even
<BR>
without the transfers, under the presumption if we averaged over enough
<BR>
policy issues, the transfers would tend to cancel each other, making
<BR>
everyone better off with the zero-transfer total policy.
<BR>
<P>When there is uncertainty, economists are typically willing to focus on
<BR>
the early viewpoint, where people do not know how the uncertainty will be
<BR>
resolved.  We look for policies which are better for each person on average,
<BR>
even though they might end up being worse for some people depending on how
<BR>
the uncertainty resolves itself.  This early viewpoint is mathematically
<BR>
equivalent to a situation without uncertainty when it contains no secrets
<BR>
(things some people know that others do not).
<BR>
<P>When there are secrets, economists typically focus on an even earlier
<BR>
perhaps imaginary situation where there were no secrets, i.e., when people
<BR>
did not know which particular secret they would learn.  This allows us to
<BR>
reduce situations with secrets to situations of no-secrets uncertainty,
<BR>
which are equivalent to situations without uncertainty, where it is
<BR>
relatively easy to find clearly best policies that make everyone better
<BR>
off.
<BR>
<P>Economists sometimes go even further, and focus on hypothetical early
<BR>
situations where there is greater symmetry across people.  For example,
<BR>
one way to compare a poor world with many people to a rich world with
<BR>
few people is to imagine that each possible person who might exist is
<BR>
uncertain about whether they will actually exist.  They then would face a
<BR>
choice between existing for sure in a poor world and only having a chance
<BR>
of existing in a rich world.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;... I would suggest that a substantial portion of government activities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;today do not flow from a simple Pareto optimality criterion.
</EM><BR>
<P>The field of law and economics attempts to understand much existing law
<BR>
in terms of the sorts of laws people would agree to if they sat down
<BR>
and drew up contracts about it long before getting into a dispute.
<BR>
People have also had some success, though limited, at understanding
<BR>
many other things governments do in similar terms.  But I certainly
<BR>
won't defend existing governments as being the best of all possible
<BR>
by these sort of criteria.
