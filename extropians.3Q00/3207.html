<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; The easiest way to remove a dictator: one bullet right through the

brain.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  That doesn't take a massed army.  It doesn't take a concerted alliance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  against him or her.  Just one bullet from one gun.  Game over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I have to get back to making sure things happen, especially with a name
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  like, &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As to who sat on their asses while massacres raged-basically we all did.
</EM><BR>
We
<BR>
<EM>&gt; being USA, Canada,Nato,France.
</EM><BR>
<P>There's that plural again!  I must be missing something.  Are you a member
<BR>
of the government?  Where did you affect the decision-making process?  Did
<BR>
Tony Blair or Bill Clinton consult with you before they decided to give
<BR>
authorization to bomb?  Or perhaps you flew missions over Belgrade?
<BR>
<P>As for me, I was a critic of the war, before, during, and after the war.
<BR>
(See below.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As for Croatia, please to let everyone know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I am not of fan of Utashis (adolph's ally in the balkans),
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay.  Hey, everyone!  Look who's not a fan of the Ustasha!  Done.  Max
<BR>
Power gets things done.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but I recall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the old Utashi dictator died recently, and was replaced by a much,
</EM><BR>
more,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; congenial government-as in non-massacre loving.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  Franjo Tudjman's died recently.  I.e., he lived a long and bloody
<BR>
life.  His party only lost power a few months ago.  The Mesic-Racan
<BR>
government seems much better and likely to reform in the direction away from
<BR>
nationalist authoritarianism.  Of course, the deed is done, so some might
<BR>
argue that Tudjman's group completed their mission.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For all their past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hideousness, the Croat-Utashi government did not draw first blood, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threaten that it would.
</EM><BR>
<P>That depends on when you start looking.  If you look in 1941, the Ustasha
<BR>
wins hands down.  If you look in the 1990s, surely, it's hard to say.  But
<BR>
even if they did not, killing innocents is wrong period, no matter who's
<BR>
doing it or when.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That was the Chetniks under Milosovich, who started
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off the camps and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Once fighting began, anything can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>The process was a little different.  I think, basically, all sides wanted
<BR>
regions wherein their ethnic group was a sizeable majority and no threat
<BR>
existed to its power.  (The same process, sadly, seems to be taken place in
<BR>
Ethiopia and Eritria right now, though, of course, no one is suggesting NATO
<BR>
get involved.)  Or, more likely, the leaders used ethnicity to stay in or
<BR>
expand their power with this kind of logic.  My point was merely Croatia
<BR>
gets a free pass here (as does just about every other nation state that
<BR>
plays the ethnic cleansing game), by the U.S. State Department and by
<BR>
Michael Lorrey.
<BR>
<P>In some cases, e.g., Indonesia, it would not even be a matter of going in
<BR>
and fighting against that government, but just of cutting of military aid.
<BR>
President Clinton had a chance to do that before the massacres in East
<BR>
Timor.  He did not and notably few people were vocal on this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As far as involvement in the process-I am just another ass-sitter who
</EM><BR>
lived
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their lives and essentially did nothing, just like everyone else.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's no one's responsibility to save the planet.  That said, if you feel the
<BR>
urge, do so, but leave those who just want to work on their small
<BR>
neighborhood alone.  Don't think you have the moral high ground because you
<BR>
want to save some strangers half a world away, regardless of whether it will
<BR>
work.  (Results are very important.  Here, we have lots of dead people and a
<BR>
region in shambles.  IMHO, the Kosovar Albanians were better before the war
<BR>
than now, especially the ones who are now dead.  Same for me.  I wouldn't
<BR>
want someone rescuing me by getting me killed.)
<BR>
<P>And I thought this list was full of libertarians, not war loving hawks!:)
<BR>
<P>Later!
<BR>
