<P><EM>&gt;I checked US crime statistics at <A HREF="http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm">http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm</A>,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I find that in the most recent year shown, 1998:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Violent Crimes:   1,531,044
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Murder:              16,914
</EM><BR>
<P>This is interesting, and useful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Only 1% of all violent crimes lead to murder.  Also, I believe I've read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elsewhere that a substantial fraction of murders do not occur in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;context of a robbery, but rather are crimes of passion committed by people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who know the victim.  This would further lower the chances that a mugging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or similar violent encounter with a criminal could lead to your death.
</EM><BR>
<P>And also logical.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If you're prepared to kill in response to robberies and other violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crimes against yourself (as I believe Mike and others advocate) then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must accept that there is a 99% chance that you are NOT defending your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life, you are rather applying the death penalty to a sub-lethal crime.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here's where you stray.  Being prepared to kill does not equate with killing.
<BR>
Just as most violent crimes do not lead to murder, most uses of guns in
<BR>
self-defense also do not lead to homicide.  Alternatives:
<BR>
<P>- The criminal knows that you are armed, so preys on others instead.  The
<BR>
altercation between you is avoided altogether.  (See Bastiat, &quot;What Is Seen
<BR>
And What Is Not Seen&quot;.)  If enough people are armed, the criminal finds
<BR>
something else to do for a living.
<BR>
<P>- The criminal attempts to assault/rob/rape you, or those in your vicinity.
<BR>
You brandish a weapon; he flees.  You let him.
<BR>
<P>- You brandish a weapon.  He stops.  The police are called.  He is arrested
<BR>
(or perhaps, these days, you are arrested for brandishing the weapon).
<BR>
<P>- You fire a warning shot to get his attention.  He flees or stops.
<BR>
<P>- He continues his attack.  You shoot to wound, despite my advice.
<BR>
<P>- He continues his attack.  You shoot to kill but do not succeed.  
<BR>
<P>- He continues his attack.  You shoot to kill, and succeed.
<BR>
<P>For many reasons, it is hard to obtain accurate statistics on incidents of
<BR>
self-defense.  Nonetheless, from what I have seen, it appears that approx.
<BR>
98% of the time, the presence of the weapon repels the attack.  And, of 
<BR>
course, many times when the weapon is fired, the perp is not killed.  My
<BR>
guess, folding in statistics on self-defense homicides, is that self-defense 
<BR>
results in the killing of the criminal far less than 1% of the time.
<BR>
<P>This correlates well with the statistics on police use of firearms.  Most
<BR>
police nationwide will never fire their weapons except at a range.  Many will
<BR>
not even have drawn their weapons.  And these are people whose central
<BR>
responsibility is to deal with criminals. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And would they support expanding the range of crimes which deserve death, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since they are personally willing to kill in response to sub-lethal crimes?  
</EM><BR>
<P>No one is advocating that if you see someone committing a crime, you pull out
<BR>
your pistol and blow them away, unless it is the only means of saving a life.  
<BR>
What is being argued is:
<BR>
<P>- You are entitled to defend yourself against violent attack.
<BR>
- We applaud people who are willing to defend others against violence.
<BR>
- Guns can be an effective means of defense, if one is trained.
<BR>
- There are alternatives to guns, like not being there in the first place, or 
<BR>
talking someone out of it.  They may be effective but are not guaranteed.
<BR>
- A necessary part of carrying a gun or knife is an honest acknowledgement that 
<BR>
this may result in taking a life.  Deal with this before you carry.
<BR>
- If you are adequately prepared, whether use of a gun in self-defense does
<BR>
take a life depends on the criminal's subsequent actions.
