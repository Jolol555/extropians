Corey asks:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Is the core idea of Extropy (as I understand it, summarized by &quot;Upward and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Outward&quot;) predicated on a libertarian philosophy?  Does one have to accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the other excess baggage that comes with libertarianism (i.e. absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom to own and use firearms, no centralized legal systems, decentralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or no environmental regulations, no public investment from non-private 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organizations, etc.) to be a true extropian?
</EM><BR>
<P>I do think that libertarianism is a natural political philosophy
<BR>
for an extropian to adopt.  Extropians believe in removing limits,
<BR>
and libertarianism is that philosophy which puts the fewest limits on
<BR>
people's actions.
<BR>
<P>Earlier I posed questions about how modern liberalism could coexist with
<BR>
an extropian philosophy.  What is the meaning of a minimum wage law,
<BR>
when there is a continuum of intelligences from AI through transhuman?
<BR>
How can the basic idea of social equality exist in a world where some
<BR>
beings think millions of times faster than others?  It seems to me that
<BR>
a laissez faire attitude will work best in the future we anticipate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I ask this question as a believer in the concepts of expanding beyond what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are accepted as &quot;common&quot; limitations - overcoming such barriers as aging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pathologies and death, limitations of the physical body (strength, endurance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc.), limitations of input bandwidth and storage, gravity wells, the speed of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light...  All of these things that we can and SHOULD overcome.
</EM><BR>
<P>Facetiously I said, &quot;we tell people that in 30 years everyone will be
<BR>
an immortal superman and they say, ho hum.  But suggest that someone
<BR>
ought to be able to work for less than the minimum age, and all hell
<BR>
breaks loose.&quot;  Seriously, I can't understand how you can accept the
<BR>
massive changes which the concepts above entail, while still being
<BR>
married to modern social government concepts.
