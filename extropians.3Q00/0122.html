<P><EM>&gt; No way, Bonnie, thats impossible, cant be done.  Just try to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an integral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while you are laughing, or even multiply two digit numbers in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; head.  You wont get there, you'll get the wrong answer.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, true. Not at the exact same moment.  Think first, then laugh, then
<BR>
think some more, then laugh some more. Like that. You might say, thinking
<BR>
and laughing at the same sitting. Or sometimes, think for half a day and
<BR>
suddenly &quot;it&quot; hits you and you laugh. Mathematically speaking, I've often
<BR>
been known to laugh with delight after working out an especially lovely
<BR>
proof.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The point of all this is:  sex selection and survival
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selection are two *different things* and in fact can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sometimes pull in different directions.  That particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; species of moose I used went extinct.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Whaddya think?
</EM><BR>
<P>First of all, what IS the plural of &quot;moose?&quot; Meese sounds good to me.  Or
<BR>
maybe meece.
<BR>
<P>Off hand, I would expect that the extinction of the big-antlered meese
<BR>
didn't happen all at once but rather took place over many generations (so
<BR>
that it wouldn't be a catestrophic sort of extinction but rather a
<BR>
transformational sort of extinction).  In each generation, the very largest
<BR>
of the large antlered meese would be unsuccesful at mating because they
<BR>
couldn't mount the females.  Thus, females who were willing to settle for
<BR>
smaller antlers would begin to contribute more genes to the pool, because,
<BR>
come on, you're not going to tell me the loser would NEVER mate, are you? We
<BR>
don't have meeses around here, but I've watched other kinds of animals, and
<BR>
while the loser may not mate right away (usually the loser's off licking his
<BR>
wounds) I guarantee you he's gonna get some on the sly later on if he
<BR>
possibly can. And some of the losers WILL find a way.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The largest-antlered meese might also die young because of the additonal
<BR>
survival cost of carrying around the big antlers.  During times of extended
<BR>
drought or other stress, the largest-antlered meese might die in droves, and
<BR>
during the time they were alive, they might be too weak to win fights, or if
<BR>
they did win they might have lower amounts of sperm, or unhealthy sperm.
<BR>
But there would be slightly smaller-antlered meese around who could take the
<BR>
place of the large-antlered ones.  And remember that sexual selection is not
<BR>
generally based on just one trait.  The visual signs like the large antlers
<BR>
are a sort of short-cut method of advertising fitness.  The underlying
<BR>
fitness values of physical strength, intelligence (eg to remember locations
<BR>
of food sources and to outwit predators by avoiding places where predators
<BR>
hide), intelligence of the immune system, etc. are still valid.  Probably
<BR>
some 2ndary trait, like coat texture would become more important as antler
<BR>
size became a less reliable sign.
<BR>
