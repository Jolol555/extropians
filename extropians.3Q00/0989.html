<EM>&gt;... nanotech is physical capital for manufacturing.   Manufacturing is about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;17% of the US economy.  All forms of non-human capital together get ~30% of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;income, so physical capital gets maybe ~20% of income.  So physical capital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for manufacturing gets ~ 3.5% of income.  So suddenly making that free, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nanotech might, is an improvement equivalent to one year's economic growth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now if you could make the labor and human capital of manufacturing cheaper,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that would be a bigger deal.  And making labor and human capital of all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;industries cheaper, as from AI or uploading, that is a huge deal.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;At the very least you'd have to add agriculture to that percentage since it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just more manufacturing to Nanotechnology. You'd also have to add in most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of transportation because there's little point in moving stuff around if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make it in place, add in construction too. You'd also need to include much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the service industry, no need for plumbers or mechanics or most repair men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for that matter because if something breaks just make a new one. We also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't need fast food workers or waiters or ...
</EM><BR>
<P>It seems your &quot;Nanotechnology&quot; is much better than my &quot;nanotech&quot;.  Your
<BR>
&quot;Nanotechnology&quot; can make just about everything so cheap you wouldn't think
<BR>
to just make another one if you ever saw any flaw in something.   And it can
<BR>
do this right next to anyone anytime.  It makes table-ready food from atoms,
<BR>
prepares table settings, recommends items, plans travel, gives haircuts,
<BR>
builds buildings, bridges, dams, and roads.  In contrast, my poor nanotech is
<BR>
just atomic-precision factories, which you'd have to figure out how to use 
<BR>
to do
<BR>
other useful stuff.
<BR>
<P>Yessiree, good idea; as long as Santa's around giving stuff out, why ask for
<BR>
&quot;nanotech&quot; when you can ask for &quot;Nanotechnology&quot;?
