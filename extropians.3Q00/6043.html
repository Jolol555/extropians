<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't know of any. The only thing which may work is not to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionary-algorithms utilizing AIs until we have mature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploads. Putting brakes on the speed of the transition, hauling as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many low-fitness folks as we can in the higher-fitness regime, before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; releasing the brakes, and speeding off. Hopefully, somebody of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks will take care of the diverse endangered species (Amish &amp; Co),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orelse they're just going to go extinct.
</EM><BR>
<P>Please be patient with me. What do you mean by mature uploads?
<BR>
(And what's wrong with letting the Amish go extinct?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Relinquishment doesn't work, at least not sustainably, but speeding up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some things while inhibiting another might save our ass in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end. (The emphasis is on *might*). As always, I welcome less brittle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solutions.
</EM><BR>
<P>So we should speed the occurrence of mature uploads. 
<BR>
(I need to know what a mature upload is first.)
