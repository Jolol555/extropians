<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; North Pole not as wet as reported
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; . . . Citing a report in The New York
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Times, The Associated Press erroneously reported Aug. 19 that open water
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had been spotted on the North Pole for the first time in 50 million years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a possible sign of global warming.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a correction Tuesday, the Times said it had misstated the normal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conditions of sea ice at the pole. It said open water probably has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; occurred there before because the Arctic Ocean is about 10 percent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ice-free during a typical summer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks, EvMick, for the info. I was wondering what was supposedly going
<BR>
on with this, having heard a report on on local CBC radio here in
<BR>
Saskatchewan, Canada. I'd note that if you follow up on the New York
<BR>
Times website, with a free account and searching for things like &quot;north
<BR>
pole ice melt&quot; you come up with a the seemingly very definite result
<BR>
that the Arctic ice pack has been reduced by 6%, just since 1978. At the
<BR>
same time, sea level is said to have been affected very little, owing to
<BR>
the fact that the reduced volume of sea ice changes total water volume
<BR>
very little, while land pack ice (Greenland, Antarctica) hasn't been
<BR>
reduced.
<BR>
<P>All of which seems a little confusing to me -- or to put it another way,
<BR>
I am not reassured that the &quot;stop global warming&quot; people really know
<BR>
what they are talking about yet. I mean, open water in the Arctic summer
<BR>
is not all that remarkable, it seems. At the same time, I have to worry
<BR>
that a 6% reduction in the ice pack overall now looks like a smoking gun
<BR>
for manmade global warming? Such a noticeable amount of melting on a
<BR>
large scale, and in only 22 years; this is more impressive than past
<BR>
computer projections of a couple of degrees warming in a century! Or, is
<BR>
it just the El Nino/La Nina ocean current changes messing with the ice
<BR>
in a way that has little to do with the overall world's temperature as
<BR>
such?
<BR>
<P>I am strongly tempted to say that the world should just *wait* on this
<BR>
problem *another* 22 years, to confirm if the actual overall world
<BR>
temperature is going up or not and also to confirm (as much as it can be
<BR>
confirmed) whether fossil fuel use is the most likely cause. At that
<BR>
point, if the *global* quality of any warming is confirmed, put a high
<BR>
priority on developing nano-engineered trucks, tractors, buses, etc.,
<BR>
that don't burn fossil fuels. For nano to get to the point of being a
<BR>
big help, this time frame seems about right -- or am I just
<BR>
oversimplifying, stalling, the enviros have it right, so that we really
<BR>
gotta *move* on this or *fry*, etc?
