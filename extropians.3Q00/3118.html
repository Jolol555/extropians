<P><EM>&gt; Good news! Progressive Insurance, based in Ohio, will now offer 25% to 50%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discount on car insurance if you fit their patented Autograph device in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; car.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great!  You mean I can give up all my freedoms and privacy, have complete and
<BR>
total surveillance over my entire life, camera's in my bedroom, a totalitarian
<BR>
status quo dictating every thing I do - and I don't have to pay anything?!  Wow,
<BR>
you mean, they will even pay me for this?!  That's great!  I get to be a slave
<BR>
to the corporations and the government and as a courtesy for my obedience
<BR>
they'll even give me discounts on consumer goods!  God, what a great time to be
<BR>
alive!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Before you immediately panic about this surveillance of your behavior,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember that your mobile phone is already (or very soon will be) providing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the authorities with very similar information.
</EM><BR>
<P>Wow, I shouldn't panic about all this, because its only going to get worse!
<BR>
This is such great news.  Pretty soon they will even know what I'm thinking.
<BR>
What a great society it's going to be - complete mind control over of all its
<BR>
citizens.  With nobody behaving or thinking outside of the status quo,
<BR>
everything will become safe and cuddly.  I can't wait!  I won't have to worry or
<BR>
even think about anything else every again.  The nanny state is going to put me
<BR>
into a cushy cocoon in which all my actions and thinking will be controlled by
<BR>
them. Ahh, the bliss!  Bring on the ID implants, the omni-surveillance, and
<BR>
don't forget those great discounts!!!
