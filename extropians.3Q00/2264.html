<EM>&gt;&quot;No longer will corporate media and big money be able to frame
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the discussion of music solely in terms of their industries,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as we draw together the strongest voices in the technology and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;independent music communities to address questions of music in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the marketplace with a clear-eyed focus on the interests of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artists.&quot;

Good link.  Another possibility, however, especially as bandwidth improves 
<BR>
and more stuff can be done live, is interactive music sessions, in which you 
<BR>
make direct requests and bid or tip as needed to get the music you want.  A 
<BR>
good model for this is the filk session.  A really good filker, such as 
<BR>
Leslie Fish, perhaps the pre-eminent filker of all time, can either pull up 
<BR>
a song from memory on just about any conceivable subject, or make up one to 
<BR>
fit on the fly.  When you've got a whole crew of filk musicians, odds are 
<BR>
that one or more of them will know exactly what kind of music fits your 
<BR>
needs.
<BR>
<P>Other possibilities include the expansion of Midi or programmed music to the 
<BR>
point that you can get any song or piece transposed on the fly to any style, 
<BR>
instrument(s) or artist.  One could also imagine a system that took fairly 
<BR>
simple readings of ones emotional state and learned how to optimally match 
<BR>
music to it - or alternatively to move one in the direction of a desired 
<BR>
state.  Such a system might utilized direct control as well, using emotional 
<BR>
parameters instead of musical notation.  Then the &quot;musician&quot; might be 
<BR>
someone who you expected - like the minstrels in the courts of old - to 
<BR>
weave an emotional spell or provide a background - like a movie soundtrack - 
<BR>
to your life.
<BR>
<P>Continuous realtime services along these lines would be prohibitively 
<BR>
expensive for most people (some of the new rich of the digeratti, however, 
<BR>
have full time musicians in their homes, I understand, for this very 
<BR>
purpose), but hiring someone like you would a therapist or a trainer or 
<BR>
gardener to create, monitor and optimize a semi-autonimous system that 
<BR>
created your personal music - pulled from the world library to fit your 
<BR>
mood, etc. - would be quite feasible.
