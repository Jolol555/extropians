Subject: Getting rich without copyright (was Napster...)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since I've been asked to give some ideas of how artists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might go about making money in the absence of copyright,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which makes the old business model of selling little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disks of information obsolete, I'll lay out a few ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here.  I'll limit the scope of discussion to musicians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is what brought up the subject (different models
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might work better for things like books and software).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - The most obvious: live performance.  Music can be copied.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   People can't (yet).  Your physical presence is therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   unique and valuable.  Back before FCC-monopolized radio,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   this was how most musicians made money (even some of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   on this list are old enough to remember when it was the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   height of crassness to have recorded music at a party).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   The Grateful Dead--the most financially successful musical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   group in history--proved that this model works.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Performance, yeah performance. You can assume people are doing this already.
<BR>
Problem is, it pays squat. It will continue to, because recordings compete
<BR>
in the same marketplace as live musicians, and they are much cheaper. Free
<BR>
recorded music is not going to help.
<BR>
<P>You can make lots of money from performing if you are already famous. Anyone
<BR>
famous can make money by standing up in front of people.
<BR>
<P>Performance at the moment is restricted by audience sizes; you've got to
<BR>
actually go around and do lots and lots and lots of gigs. Maybe as bandwidth
<BR>
on the net improves, something new will become possible; performing live on
<BR>
the net. I know people already do it, but it's pretty shite and not
<BR>
interactive; Need More Bandwidth (there's a mantra for you all to recite)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - The second most obvious: work for hire: write songs for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   people who pay you to write songs.  Folks like Mark
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Knopfler and Jon Williams get millions for a movie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   soundtrack.  Write commissioned pieces for commercials.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Sell product placements in your lyrics.  (Neil &quot;Ain't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   singin' for Pepsi&quot; Young contributes to the poverty of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   musicians by giving them an idiotic ethic that making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   money is bad).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Work for hire, yes, that's ok, it's currently available, it works. It's a
<BR>
pretty damned small market though (unless you count the stupid jingles and
<BR>
crap that pervades our media, then maybe you can say it's big). But this
<BR>
defeats much of the purpose of the work of many musicians; I might as well
<BR>
write software, because it really pays.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Personal appearance: even non-performing appearances can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   be a revenue source for someone well-known enough.  Famous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   musicians make money endorsing products, appearing on talk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   shows, speaking at conferences, etc.  You can even sell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   small bits of personal access to fans, say by charging to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   answer email or phone calls about your music.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>As above, yes, if you are famous you can make money from your personal fame.
<BR>
Standard approach for aspiring musos with any sense:
<BR>
1 - Get Famous
<BR>
2 - Get Paid for being Famous
<BR>
with the caveat
<BR>
1b - Stay alive whilst getting Famous, without overly impacting on the core
<BR>
business of Get Famous.
<BR>
<P>1b is the hard bit.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Merchandising.  Just as your physical presence is unique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and valuable, so is your name and reputation.  Sell T-Shirts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and mugs and posters on your website.  Sell memberships to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   fan club with benefits like a newsletter, entry to private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   clubs or special seating at performances, limited-edition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and autographed merchandise.  Sell &quot;authorized&quot; recordings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that come with autographs or extra perks like discounts on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   performances, access to private clubs, etc.  Sell autographed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   pictures and lyric sheets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Merchandising is good, yet again it already exists. If I wanted to make
<BR>
money from merchandising, I wouldn't go into the music business and make
<BR>
t-shirts with my ugly mug on them. It's just a tack-on tactic to try to
<BR>
scrape together a few extra bucks.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Hipness/Timeliness: Even if the music can be copied, it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   only be copied /after/ it is released, and there is value in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   being first on the block or &quot;hip&quot;.  Even an album that every-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   one knew would be downloadable from the net January 2 would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   sell copies on January 1, especially if it were arranged as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   a premiere event, or as a perk for club members.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This relates to Hal's excellent post on waiting for a certain number of
<BR>
pledges before releasing.
<BR>
<P>This is basically swapping information ownership with information hiding.
<BR>
This is a sticky point. Say you have already produced a work, and there is
<BR>
no information ownership. Is it actually legal or moral to keep that work
<BR>
hidden, until such time as you decide to release it? It looks almost like
<BR>
extortion; you are holding something which is not rightfully yours, until
<BR>
you are paid a certain amount of money.
<BR>
<P>A related problem is that someone can steal your work, and pre-release it.
<BR>
Happens now anyway I think. In a world of free accessible full quality
<BR>
recordings, this is a major, major problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Adaptation: Don't forget that without copyright, artists are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   also more free to draw upon previous work to create collages,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   adaptations, and other derivatives of other work.  Specialize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   in doing Disco or Reggae versions of pop tunes.  Make MIDI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   transcriptions of other tunes.  Translate lyrics into other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   languages.  Make new arrangements for small bands to perform.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>So I can take other people's work, adapt it, and also make no money from it
<BR>
just like them. Aw, shucks, that's just too generous.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Convenience: Even when information is cheap, /finding/ it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   not.  Consumer attention is valuable, so make the most of that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   by making it easy for people to buy authorized recordings on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the authorized site and other easy-to-find locations.  Give them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   lots of versions of everything at good prices.  Capitalize on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   their attention by selling advertising on the website and in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   your liner notes and on your merchandise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is why the big companies will stick around; see the reply to Hal's post
<BR>
for my rave about this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - Voluntary contributions: I don't personally think much of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   method, but a lot of people seem to so I'll mention it: solicit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   contributions based solely on goodwill.  Things like &quot;Street
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Performer Protocol&quot; make this easier.  This is the business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   model for public television, for the most part.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless you peg releases against donation thresholds, this has got to be a
<BR>
pretty marginal tactic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's a pageful off the top of my head; I'm sure there are more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the next person who brings up the &quot;artists will starve without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copyright&quot; meme will be fined the total of Micheal Jackson's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interview fee, Barbara Streisand's performance fee, Jon Williams'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movie soundtrack fee, and the total revenues from Back Street
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Boys' merchandise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll anticipate a few possible counter-arguments:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - &quot;Those methods won't work/won't make enough money&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   They'll make different people different amounts of money, that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   true.  I am indeed proposing a major change in the laws, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that will affect a lot of people; some worse, some better.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the same can be said of any change in law or technology.  Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   people will be better off and some worse.  Machines put a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   people out of work, as does ending a subsidy program.  But the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   benefits to the economy and society as a whole weigh strongly in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   favor of ending subsidies and automating production.  For every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   one put out of work, two or three get hired in other jobs by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   new expanded economy.  The benefits to the economy and society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   as a whole of totally unfettering all communication of information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I can't even begin to calculate, but I can't imagine a greater
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   single thing we could do to encorage development of culture and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>Unless no one can afford the luxury of producing anything anymore.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - &quot;Artists shouldn't sell out&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Tough.  Snobbery costs money.  If you don't want to do what it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   takes to earn money in the free market, you deserve to starve.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;That's an opinion, which only serves to justify the fact that if you don't
<BR>
do what it takes to earn money in the &quot;free&quot; market, you will starve.
<BR>
<P>Also, you must always qualify this statement with another truth: if you
<BR>
already have money, this doesn't apply to you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   In a free market, money is earned, by definition, by doing things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   /other/ people want, and will pay for.  Some of us are lucky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   enough to do things we also enjoy doing, but that's a luxury.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   People want music around, so they will figure out ways to get it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   and ways to pay for it.  But if that way is to offer a songwriter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   money to do a commercial, and ey turns the offer down, ey has no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   right to complain that ey is poor, or that ey can't make enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   money doing what ey wants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ey should be soundly flogged!
<BR>
<P>I've got no problems with selling out, I just want to own what I produce.
<BR>
<P>Or not. Actually, I agree quite strongly with you on this Lee; information
<BR>
should be free. But I think this is only half the picture, because I think
<BR>
everything should be free.
<BR>
<P>Seriously. To be more precise, I think that ownership is a seriously flawed
<BR>
concept that damages freedom, and has created the massively unjust world in
<BR>
which we now live, with a small minority of people making up the very rich
<BR>
(that's us westerners), and the large majority of people belonging to the
<BR>
legions of the mindnumbingly, incomprehensibly poor. This, because people
<BR>
own things, which means that others in turn are excluded from their use.
<BR>
<P>I detailed in a recent post one idea for a future market economy which did
<BR>
not include a concept of ownership (or more correctly, included the concept
<BR>
that everyone owns everything). In that scenario, I would have absolutely no
<BR>
problem with taking away copyright; it becomes meaningless.
<BR>
<P>In our current economy, however, taking away ownership from musicians is not
<BR>
reasonable. The only reason it can be done is because music resembles
<BR>
information, and can be transmitted as such. It's not really information; it
<BR>
takes sophisticated hardware to turn that music into information, and then
<BR>
back into music. Nanotech general assemblers are touted to do the same thing
<BR>
with material objects; it doesn't mean such objects are information, they
<BR>
just resemble and are encodable as such.
<BR>
<P>At such time as full nanotech arrives, then good, no more copyright. But
<BR>
now, it just damages the ability of people who create original knowledge
<BR>
objects to profit from that creation. I think people just see what they have
<BR>
the ability to get away with, and pick selected bits out of personal
<BR>
ideology to support that activity. It might help them sleep at night, but
<BR>
that doesn't make it ok.
