<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Except that linux is NOT free. It typically is sold on CD-ROM for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; $40-80, which is little different from other operating systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The only thing that buying the actual CD from RedHat gets you is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; according to the website:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Installation support 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Priority Online Access for software updates 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Printed manuals and Documentation CD 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A large collection of some of the most popular Linux applications on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; CD-ROM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Can I reproduce a Redhat CD-ROM and sell them for a buck if I want to? N
</EM><BR>
o, I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; can't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Um, actually, as long as it's all GPL software, under the terms of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; GPL, you can do so totally legally.  (There may be some non-GPL
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; software in there, I guess, that you'd have to leave out, though the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; core OS is all GPL.)  You can make all the copies of the GPL'ed code
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you want and distribute them for any price you choose.  That's kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the point of the GPL.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So what you are saying, is that I can copy the Redhat CD on my burners, sell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them and pocket the money, and RedHat will have to provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installation support,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; online access for updates, manuals and documentation, etc...
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>Well, no, and sorry if I phrased the &quot;what you get&quot; part incorrectly
<BR>
or ambiguously.  I believe the way it works is this:
<BR>
<P>By buying the shrink-wrapped RedHat box, you get the same software you
<BR>
can get for free from the FTP site.  You can legally distribute that.
<BR>
In fact, Red Hat is legally forbidden from stopping you -- it's mostly
<BR>
made up of stuff they merely bundled from someone else that comes with
<BR>
the GPL attached, and they'd be in trouble for trying to stop you from
<BR>
redistributing it, which is what they've done after all; redistributed
<BR>
somebody else's GPL'ed code.
<BR>
<P>However, the &quot;extra&quot; value you get for buying the actual CD from Red
<BR>
Hat in the nice Red Hat shrink-wrapped box for the full Red Hat price
<BR>
is their printed matter, installation support, the priority access for
<BR>
updates, etc.  I don't know if this comes in the form of a certificate
<BR>
with a unique RedHat cusomter ID #, or the proof of purchase number on
<BR>
the box or whatever, but this is the one thing that a reseller cannot
<BR>
provide.  (At least, not legally.)
<BR>
<P>So in some sense I won't get the same thing if I buy the &quot;Lorrey
<BR>
Special Edition Red Hat Linux&quot; distro for $5.99, act now, limited
<BR>
offer, sales tax may apply.   :-)  I certainly won't get all those
<BR>
items RedHat offers only to their own customers.
<BR>
<P>But I will get the core RedHat distro OS source and object code,
<BR>
suitable for installation on my PC.  And I don't think Red Hat can
<BR>
legally stop you from going into that business should you so choose,
<BR>
nor do I think they'd want to stop you.  Moreover, I believe some
<BR>
people are in that business -- cut-rate Red Hat CD's -- and Red Hat
<BR>
has not tried to stop them.
<BR>
<P>So Red Hat is not trying to stop people from getting their Linux
<BR>
distro for free, or even from redistributing it for money -- in fact
<BR>
they in some sense encourage this by making the code available for
<BR>
free FTP.  They are trying, however, to encourage people to pay the
<BR>
$40 or whatever for the support, manuals, etc.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James
