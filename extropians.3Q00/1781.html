<P>
In the 1986, &quot;Mandala&quot; appeared on the Amiga, the first &quot;videoplace&quot; to run 
<BR>
on a personal computer.  When the initial review appeared in the TPUG, the 
<BR>
magazine of the world's largest user group, the Toronto Pet User Group, I 
<BR>
and many other readers immediately forecast a world of applications.
<BR>
<P>Mandala, from The Vivid Group of Toronto, offered a completely GUI-based 
<BR>
authoring environment in which to create applications controlled via the 
<BR>
video input.  I.e., you saw yourself - or at least your silouhette (sp?) - 
<BR>
on screen, and it was the control object.  You could program any kind of 
<BR>
interaction based on contact, direction, velocity, etc. for real time 
<BR>
interactions with a virtual environment, and you could address and send or 
<BR>
receive from any device on the system - serial, parallel ports, etc., as 
<BR>
well as the Amiga's logical devices - which could be just about anything, 
<BR>
all from within the Mandala GUI.  The maximum interactive frame rate was 
<BR>
about 14, but that was good enough for a lot of applications.
<BR>
<P>One of the applications that a local user - a Mr. Salcedo, as I recall - 
<BR>
developed here in Orange County, CA was to use the drum set that came as a 
<BR>
demo app with a quadrapleagic kid at the Blind Children's Center.  This kid 
<BR>
could move one finger on one hand.  Using a camera with a macro lens, he 
<BR>
could now play the drums.
<BR>
<P>During this period, I owned an amazon parrot, which ultimately died from 
<BR>
neglect after pulling out all its feathers and becoming quite neurotic and 
<BR>
hostile.  This was my fault, but I just couldn't be there.  One of the 
<BR>
obvious applications which I thought of for Mandala was pet training and pet 
<BR>
games for animals like parrots who need constant interaction.  It also 
<BR>
occurred to me that a parrot network could be set up by which parrots could 
<BR>
call each other up for company, although I don't think that there was any 
<BR>
off-the-shelf software available then to support such a project.  (I did go 
<BR>
so far as to digitally record my parrot's flocking cry and would sometimes 
<BR>
set one of my Amigas to play it back at random intervals when I was not 
<BR>
there.)
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, Mandala and the necessary hardware to run it were expensive 
<BR>
and I couldn't afford it.  (Vivid originally offered the software quite 
<BR>
cheaply, but then kept raising the price, ultimately to $1,000, and then 
<BR>
discontinued it as a programmable system and went to selling $40,000 
<BR>
stand-alone compiled apps, meanwhile working on developing patents for 
<BR>
individual techniques.  Later Intel apparently entered into some kind of 
<BR>
arrangement with them as well.)
<BR>
<P>By the time I did get CyberScape, a Mandala clone, my parrot had departed 
<BR>
for the great flock in the sky.  I did write some articles about various 
<BR>
applications for Videoplaces, which appeared in various Amiga magazines and 
<BR>
later on a Web news service.  And I discussed my parrot or pet training 
<BR>
applications with numerous individuals, including pet store owners and vets 
<BR>
over the years.
<BR>
<P>Since then, CyberScape has appeared for the PC platform running a full 30 
<BR>
frames per second interaction - requiring a MATROX Meteor ($500) card, 
<BR>
unfortunately, and Reality Fusion, the first company formed under Guy 
<BR>
Kawasaki's Garage.com, has a product that overcome's one of the major 
<BR>
problems with previous products - backgrounds.
<BR>
<P>Other personal computer Videoplaces required a blank background or other 
<BR>
tricks to extract the control object for edge detection.  Reality Fusion's 
<BR>
product, which has appeared as compiled demo apps on various PC camera 
<BR>
packages from Intel and Logitech, uses some sophisticated processing to 
<BR>
extract the moving actor from any random background.
<BR>
<P>My understanding is that the algorythm is based on wavelet compression, 
<BR>
which is how I thought it should be done, and which I suggested to the 
<BR>
author of CyberScape some years ago.  However, it does really drag the 
<BR>
system down to add the additional layer of processing, based on the store 
<BR>
demos I've seen so far.  The actual interactive frame rate appears to be 
<BR>
about 1 or 2 per second on a 300Mhz PC.  The hardware will catch up, 
<BR>
however, now that the basic problem has been hacked.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;OC Register&quot; yesterday carried a story about a researcher at MIT's 
<BR>
Media Lab - Irene Pepperberg - who had trained a parrot to surf the web, 
<BR>
using a joystick type interface into which it inserts its head.  The article 
<BR>
cited the problems that many parrot owners have with keeping their birds 
<BR>
from pining away from loneliness.  This system allows a parrot at home to 
<BR>
call up the owner for a chat, or to visit with other parrots on the web.  
<BR>
The Media Lab website has further information on previous research done by 
<BR>
Ms. Pepperberg with parrots.
<BR>
<P>The odd thing, as it struck me, is that the Media Lab is allegedly one of 
<BR>
the hotbeds of VideoPlace development.  Scientific American's cover story 
<BR>
some years back was about their &quot;smart home&quot; project, involving some 60 
<BR>
researchers who were using - in about 90% of the cases described - 
<BR>
videoplace technology for interactions between the home 
<BR>
computing/entertainment/control/automation/alarm/communication system and 
<BR>
the inhabitants.  So why didn't Ms. Pepperberg use any of that technology 
<BR>
with her parrot?
<BR>
<P>There are other oddities connected with the Media Lab's videoplace 
<BR>
endeavors.  Myron Kreuger holds the patent on VideoPlace, and he literally 
<BR>
wrote the book on its use, potential and problems to be overcome.  He has 
<BR>
done decades of professional research on the technology, including thousands 
<BR>
of experiments in the psychology of interaction.  Yet the Scientific 
<BR>
American article never cited him.
<BR>
<P>I used to cover this stuff for various magazines, as I mentioned above.  
<BR>
When I would go to SIGGRAPH, Mandala would be there in some incarnation, and 
<BR>
MIT would always have a videoplace from the Media Lab.  However, the MIT 
<BR>
stuff was generally a total dog.  Despite all the hype, as in the Sci. Am. 
<BR>
article, it appeared that they couldn't even come close to Mandala in actual 
<BR>
performance.  According to Myron, they were lucky to get 1 or 2 frames per 
<BR>
second, even though they were typically running very powerful hardware - SGI 
<BR>
or the like.  He was also quite bitter about the fact that they never gave 
<BR>
him credit for inventing the technology, and completely ignored his patent.  
<BR>
(His actual stated opinions were quite a bit more harsh than this, but I 
<BR>
don't want to misquote him.)
<BR>
<P>So, this morning I called the Media Lab from work, with idea of having a 
<BR>
friendly chat with Ms. Pepperberg.  I wondered why she wasn't using 
<BR>
videoplace, but I also had a list of other related questions and 
<BR>
suggestions.  (The security systems manufacturing company for which I work 
<BR>
is planning on getting into CCTV and the smart home stuff at some point in 
<BR>
the future, but they are just looking around at this point, but this at 
<BR>
least gave me a legitimate excuse to call.)
<BR>
<P>When I got the Media Lab, I was informed that Ms. Pepperberg was travelling, 
<BR>
but I could leave a message.  However, when I mentioned that I was calling 
<BR>
from work, I was informed that in that case I should not expect a call back, 
<BR>
as Ms. Pepperberg was contractually bound not to discuss her research with 
<BR>
anyone except the companies providing the funding for the Media Lab.  Of 
<BR>
course, a lot of that funding, I'm sure comes from your and my tax dollars, 
<BR>
as well.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line:  As I have suggested for about a decade now, the VideoPlace 
<BR>
stuff as well as a host of other applications - many of them quite obvious 
<BR>
to anyone generally knowledgeable in the field - are being quietly 
<BR>
copyrighted or patented by the big players.
<BR>
<P>Five years or so from now, when the home level system finally gets past the 
<BR>
PC architecture / Windose bottleneck and Myron's patent expires, we'll see a 
<BR>
huge influx of proprietary apps from the big players and the lone inventor - 
<BR>
the Wozniak or Bushnell - or the small startup company will find themselves 
<BR>
completely shut out.  Even people like Myron, who has the very broad patent 
<BR>
on the entire field, will probably find, as he has, that the costs of 
<BR>
enforcing a patent can be prohibitive for an individual or small company.
<BR>
<P>So, I'm looking for a good place to locate my Free Idea Factory site 
<BR>
meanwhile, where  I will solicit people to post great ideas, for which they 
<BR>
would get credit for all posterity, but by which they would be rendered 
<BR>
permanently unpatentable.  If I do it right, it will be impossible to 
<BR>
ignore, and all the would-be patenters will have to check there first.  
<BR>
(Maybe I should patent this idea first?)
<BR>
<P>Suggestions?????
