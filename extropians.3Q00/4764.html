<P><EM>&gt;&gt; To close this note, some of you may or may not know that John Forbes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Nash, Jr., the mathematical genius and winner of the Nobel Prize in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; Economics (1994, for work in &quot;Game Theory&quot;) was a paranoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; schizophrenic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Another one would be Robert Pirsig, author of Zen and the Art of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Motorcycle Maintenance.  Dont know if it was P-S that he had, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he himself wrote that he was messed up psychologically, yet look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at the product.  John Steinbeck wrote East of Eden in an alcoholic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fog, along with who knows what psychological conditions.  Amazing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what a partially disfunctional brain can accomplish.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes.
<BR>
<P>(BTW, the first five Americans who won a Nobel Prize for literature
<BR>
were alchoholics: Sinclair Lewis, O'Neill, Faulkner, Hemingway, and
<BR>
Steinbeck).
<BR>
<P>Some famous creative individuals thought to have schizophrenia were
<BR>
Nietsche, Nijinksy, Van Gogh, Ezra Pound, Wittgenstein, Hoelderlin,
<BR>
Blake, Kafka, Joyce.
<BR>
<P>The biggest difference between a creative person and the
<BR>
schizophrenic person is that the creative person has his/her thought
<BR>
processes (relatively-speaking) under control, in the process of
<BR>
building of something creative.
<BR>
<P>The schizophrenic person, on the other hand, does not have their
<BR>
thought processes under control, and is at the mercy of
<BR>
associations, disconnected thinking; they frequently have an
<BR>
inability to sort, interpret and respond in ways typical to normal
<BR>
brains. An inner madness. Schizophrenia is the ultimate horror in a
<BR>
disease -- with this disease one cannot trust one's own brain.
<BR>
<P>Another illness- manic-depressive, is more conducive to creativity
<BR>
because the thinking process isn't as impaired, and because the
<BR>
manic-depressive person in their manic state has high levels of
<BR>
energy. Many more famous creative people are/were manic-depressive.
<BR>
<P>One of the things I find interesting in the schizophrenic illness,
<BR>
though, is that the internal world of a schizophrenic is
<BR>
self-consistent and extremely logical. They start from a premise,
<BR>
and then build an elaborate set of logical connections from that
<BR>
premise. To anyone on the outside, though, the premise is bizarre,
<BR>
crazy.
<BR>
<P>One has to be careful about the tendency to romanticize these
<BR>
people's great creative works. To a schizophrenic, especially,
<BR>
having this illness can be extremely unpleasant. Probably when they
<BR>
are gripped at the extreme of their altered state, they can't think
<BR>
of being any different, however leading into and out of that state,
<BR>
they often know that something is way off with how their brains are
<BR>
functioning. I suggest reading letters from schizophrenics to see
<BR>
how their inner world looks to them. Quite distressing.
<BR>
<P>&quot;As for me, you mush know that I shouldn't precisely have chosen
<BR>
madness if there had been any choice.&quot; (Vincent Van Gogh, 1889)
