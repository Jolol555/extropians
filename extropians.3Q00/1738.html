<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want the government to pay me to make part of the national ballistic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; missile defense.
</EM><BR>
<P>You and every other dogbert wannabe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My plan is to put up four or five thousand microsatellites in very plotted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orbits thus to not be space debris that at any time could be aimed at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hostile booster rockets on the way up thus to avoid the issue of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discriminating among multiple reentry warheads.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since you would need four or five thousand of your microsats in a
<BR>
trajectory locus with launchers likely positions at any given time,
<BR>
which would only cover a few percent of the globe, you would actually
<BR>
need about a hundred thousand such satellites.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That plan would cost less and subsidize the development of inexpensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; launch mchinery, perhaps even the National Aerospace Plane.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nah, if they are microsats, you only need microrockets (and you'll make
<BR>
microprofits, just ask Henry Ford III)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; So, this thread is telling me that to get business from the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires a lot of lawyers and contract writers.  The rest, of course, would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be subcontracted to real-world engineers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, a shower curtain might be fireproof and a hammer containing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; micrometers, but ut is still so that the government has paid thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollars for a single coffee machine to some green machine purpose.
</EM><BR>
<P>And teledesic thought they could put up their micro comsats for only $5
<BR>
million apiece. Bah!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, we could always encourage the military to subsidize itself with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bake sales, or, as in the case in which the commander of the U.S. military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Colombia has shown how to do:  coke sales.  Off topic:  the right wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paramilitary organization sponsored by the government, police, and coke
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sales in Colombia is probably guilty of the most human rights infractions in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this hemisphere in the last year.
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be counting on the human rights violations of former Seattle
<BR>
Police Cheif Norman &quot;stamp my little footie&quot; Stamper at the 'Battle in
<BR>
Seattle', I presume? ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's something to consider:  1/4 of all entire federal budget is military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or military-construction based.  That is to say:  about 25 cents of each tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollar, if anyone knew how many there were, are spent on military or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military construction accounts.  Yet, unless one is building things for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government ala high-speed low target offset tolerance research testbed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rockets and thus being paid in the name of that budget, or is otherwise in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the military, it doesn't do the country any good.  The last U.S. limitary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expedition was Serbia where the U.S. was part of the U.N. forces, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there were enough bombs sitting around requiring budget justification to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drop one on the Chinese embassy.  As well, for some time, the U.S. enforced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone over Iraq.  Still, we have hundreds of thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; active-duty troops who will never see combat.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, no. Current Military spending is now below 14 percent of outlays.
<BR>
Most active duty troops in ANY army never see combat, and that is by
<BR>
design. YOu CANT run a modern military where every member is a combat
<BR>
troop. Take the Air Force, for example. The average flight squadron is
<BR>
manned by between 350-800 people, depending on the number of planes in
<BR>
the squadron, the size of the planes, etc. The 318th Fighter Interceptor
<BR>
Squadron, for example, was 380 people or thereabouts, with 18 F-15A/B
<BR>
fighters. We had 24 pilots assigned to the squadron, ten of whome were
<BR>
in command positions, so they only maintained their ratings mostly, and
<BR>
did little extensive flying. We had about 12 security police assiged
<BR>
from the SP squadron on base to provide security (i.e. not counted in
<BR>
the 380). So 14-24 out of 380 people in the unit actually would see
<BR>
combat if the unit was called into action, or about 3-6%. The rest of us
<BR>
were weapons qualified, and a few were security adjutants, like me, to
<BR>
do anti-sniper support on the flight line in addition to our normal
<BR>
duties working on planes. If a war overseas came up, not all units would
<BR>
go, since we would need to keep some home and some in reserve to send to
<BR>
another hotspot if it sprang up in the meantime, so lets say 1 out of 3
<BR>
units gets sent overseas to a war, which means in a war, 1-2 percent of
<BR>
the manpower of the US Air Force Tactical Air Command would actually be
<BR>
'in combat', and thats the way it should be. Those 99-98% of the
<BR>
manpower are what enable that 1 or 2 percent to do their jobs flying
<BR>
those combat planes. The planes wouldn't fly if those ground people were
<BR>
also infantry troops sitting in a trench fighting the bad guys at the
<BR>
front.
