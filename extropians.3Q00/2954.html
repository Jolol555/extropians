<EM>&gt;From: Paul Hughes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:paul@planetp.cc?Subject=Re:%20Transparency%20(Was%20Human%20ID%20implant%20to%20be%20unveiled%20soon)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F83DgC81TbdkSmLAztx000009e6@hotmail.com&gt;">paul@planetp.cc</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The problem here is that such a thing could become compulsory.  The problem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transparent society are twofold.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One, there is no guarantee that everyone will be equally transparent.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see it as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perfectly reasonable that only the rich will afford privacy, making it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instead a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;totalitarian nightmare.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see it that way.  If only the rich and powerful were able to avoid 
<BR>
transparency, then that would truly be an Orwellian dystopia.  But how long 
<BR>
would you sit still for that state of affairs?  I am the *biggest* 
<BR>
transparency advocate I know.  But if transparency only applied to the weak 
<BR>
and/or poor, I would join in the revolution against the regime arm in arm 
<BR>
with the likes of Mike Lorrey and fight to the death.  I have a feeling Mike 
<BR>
and I would not be alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Secondly, assuming a transparent society becomes completely omni-lateral, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;instead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of everyone being forced to tolerate everyone else's ideosynchrocies, a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;backlash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could happen where societies norms are even more oppressive, as everyone is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to &quot;behave&quot;  in the what was the sanctuary of their once private homes.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;loosing that great job you've had for 5 years when your prudish boss finds 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like a little S&amp;M on occasion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I don't see it that way.  I think once transparency is in place it 
<BR>
will become apparent just how mainstream many &quot;alternative&quot; lifestyles are.  
<BR>
There's an S&amp;M club in Hollywood I've been to a few times and its not just 
<BR>
the leather clad and heavily-tattooed-and-pierced who are in attendance.  
<BR>
There are lots of folks who look like they could be your neighbor (or even 
<BR>
your boss) who are there gettin' their spank on.  I believe we will come to 
<BR>
view all manner of alternative pastimes just as most people now view 
<BR>
homosexuality: &quot;It's not my bag, but if it floats your boat, more power to 
<BR>
ya!&quot;
