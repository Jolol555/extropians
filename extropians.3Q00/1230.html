<BR>
Thursday's July 13,2000 edition of the
<BR>
Vancouver Sun
<BR>
<P>'Earn money while you sleep.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;London - Soon computer owners will be able to earn money in their sleep.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three companies plan to pay PC owners to leave their idle machines logged on
<BR>
to the Internet, the British
<BR>
magazine New Scientist reported on Wednesday.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. - based companies Parabon, Distributed Science and United Devices plan to
<BR>
chop up corporate
<BR>
computing tasks and farm them out to tens of thousands of personal computers via
<BR>
the Web, the magazine said.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make indolent computers earn their keep, owners simply have to download
<BR>
software and log on.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan may not offer much in the way of a high tech investment.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Albea, chief operations officer of Distributed Science, estimated that an
<BR>
average personal computer
<BR>
would earn at least $10 a month.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But people already appear to be doubling up on PCs to increase their income -
<BR>
Albea told New Scientist that 39,000 people with 77,000 computers had signed up
<BR>
so far.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;People are dragging old PCs out of the cupboard to get connected to the
<BR>
project,&quot; he said.'
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Distributed Science's webpage is still under construction
<BR>
(www.distributedscience.com). This business is currently
<BR>
operating from www.processtree.com. Another relevant website is www.parabon.com.
