<BR>
<EM>&gt; Just out of curiosity, the legal suit by Metallica,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was it discussed here? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so... I may have fwd'ed a few things
<BR>
about it a few months ago (or maybe not, I might be
<BR>
thinking of another list), but that's all AFAIK.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What does the list think of Napster? Is ethical or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-ethical? Do you use it? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I use it almost every day. I can't speak for anyone
<BR>
else, but in my opinion this whole thing (the
<BR>
lawsuits- RIAA, Metallica, Dre, etc) is ridiculous.
<BR>
Sure, there are some die-hards who will adamantly
<BR>
declare &quot;I'll never buy a CD again!&quot;, but they are
<BR>
quite the relative minority, and they probably
<BR>
wouldn't have bought but a few, if any, even without
<BR>
Napster. And I, as well as the great majority of
<BR>
people I have spoken with in Napster's chatrooms, and
<BR>
the website's messageboards, agree that Napster is
<BR>
only *helping* these people (artists *and* stores
<BR>
*and* the RIAA), not hurting them as has been so
<BR>
widely declared. I don't have the exact figures at the
<BR>
moment (but could go look them up again if you want),
<BR>
but I remember something along the lines of CD sales
<BR>
having increased by ~9% A.N. (After Napster)! Why?
<BR>
Well, at least in my case (and as I said, many of the
<BR>
people I have talked to), since beginning to use
<BR>
Napster, I have discovered many artists (&gt;50) whom I
<BR>
would probably have never heard of otherwise, and
<BR>
either have bought one or more of their CDs already or
<BR>
have them on my list of ones to buy as soon as I have
<BR>
the money to; listened to songs from different CDs by
<BR>
the same artist to decide which of them I'd rather
<BR>
buy; and bought/want quite a few compilations of
<BR>
various artists (whereas B.N. I had bought only two
<BR>
compilations, which I knew already that I liked
<BR>
most/all of the artists on it, so I wouldn't get stuck
<BR>
with a couple good songs and a bunch I didn't like,
<BR>
but now can check out the songs ahead of time). Due to
<BR>
lack of harddrive space, I compress any mp3s I
<BR>
download to 96kbps if they weren't already, to save
<BR>
space although the sound quality isn't very good
<BR>
(although I can't tell the difference between anything
<BR>
96kbps or higher on my speakers, with my headphones -
<BR>
the expensive ones or the cheap ones - I can barely
<BR>
stand the sound quality below 192kbps, even though I
<BR>
don't have room to store them like that), so I want
<BR>
the CDs anyway so that I get good sound quality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I would imagine many here believe it ethical, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should it be only recording industry issue... or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does that mean all software can also be put up for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grabs eventually? Books? Movies? Genomes? ;  - )
</EM><BR>
<P>Personally I don't have a problem with that,
<BR>
especially if/when &quot;full nanotech&quot; becomes widespread
<BR>
enough that money/capitalism becomes unnessecary
<BR>
anyway due to people not having to *pay* for stuff
<BR>
anymore, just assemble it :) I don't have the time and
<BR>
certainly not the knowledge to discuss this question
<BR>
in detail, but I'm sure someone else will do so and so
<BR>
I'll leave it to them ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am interested in thoughts on Napster. Not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Metallica, I think they're idiots to sue their own 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fan base....
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, definitely. I was one of the  banned (and one of
<BR>
the 'lucky' few who managed to get back on ;) ), due
<BR>
to one mp3 with Metallica in its name-- but it wasn't
<BR>
even one off any of their albums, just a remix of one
<BR>
of their songs a friend of mine did. I had even been
<BR>
planning to buy their new double-album (that symphony
<BR>
one, _S&amp;M_) soon as I had enough money, when they
<BR>
pulled out that lawsuit and ban stuff-- so much for
<BR>
that! :) IMHO any profits they've lost have been from
<BR>
that baaaad move, not from Napster itself! :)
<BR>
<P>Onward,
<BR>
