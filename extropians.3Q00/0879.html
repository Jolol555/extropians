<EM>&gt; No, suits are enslaved, artists are free.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You have it so backwards it's funny! 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We're doing what we want and getting paid.
</EM><BR>
<P>Go read Courtney Love's article in Salon sometime.  Most artists
<BR>
are getting toally screwed.  Yes, they're doing work and getting
<BR>
paid, but they're getting a very small percentage of the value
<BR>
they actually produce, and making a lot of other people rich who
<BR>
don't deserve it.  They also have next to no input into the process
<BR>
of how their work is sold and marketed.  In my dictionary, when
<BR>
you're producing millions of dollars of economic value to line the
<BR>
pockets of someone who's doing you no service, that's slavery, and
<BR>
I stand by that as a description of the music industry today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; An artist &quot;taking it laying down&quot; when we pay our manager or agent?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not if we're getting a very good service in return. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  And some agents and managers earn their money--notably
<BR>
those of professional athletes.  I'm not arguing from the mistaken
<BR>
labor theory of value that /all/ the value of an artwork comes
<BR>
from the artist--quite the opposite.  Information has /no/ inherent
<BR>
value at all, just as labor has no inherent value.  Marketers who
<BR>
create demand and execs who manage distribution and agents who
<BR>
negotiate deals create value just as the artist does.  But those
<BR>
words are meaningless without real numbers attached to them, and
<BR>
the numbers I've seen look to me like the record industry has in
<BR>
the past and is continuing to screw most artists.
<BR>
