<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Mark D. Fulwiler&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mdf1960@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Responsibility%20for%20children&In-Reply-To=&lt;F282sSVhGOD6gx3lKy80000232e@hotmail.com&gt;">mdf1960@yahoo.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Does anyone else here think is unfair and unjust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that a woman can always get out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsibility for a child (before birth by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aborting it and after birth by putting it up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;adoption), while a man can literally be held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsible for hundreds of thousands in expenses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just because he was careless enough not to use a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rubber
</EM><BR>
<P>Being a hetero man (and one who was once falsely accused of fathering a 
<BR>
child out of wedlock), your comments strike a chord with me.  However, I 
<BR>
think the current state of affairs is the lesser of two evils.  If men were 
<BR>
able to say &quot;OK, I fathered this child, but I want nothing to do with it, 
<BR>
and refuse to financially support it,&quot; I think that would impose an 
<BR>
unconscionable hardship upon single mothers and fatherless kids.  No matter 
<BR>
what, its not the kids fault and the kid deserves to be provided for.  If 
<BR>
not by his dad, then by the state, which vicariously makes *me* (as a tax 
<BR>
payer) financially responsible for his kid.  Thanks but no thanks.
<BR>
<P>So, yeah it might be rough on fathers of unwanted kids.  But, hey, if you're 
<BR>
a man who does not want to have kids there are ways to avoid it.  If you are 
<BR>
careless, or get duped, or are just terribly unlucky, them's the breaks.  
<BR>
When you get trimmed, just consider potential fatherhood one of the 
<BR>
potential costs.
