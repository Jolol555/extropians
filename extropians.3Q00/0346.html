1. Yes he hints at it strongly.
<BR>
<P>2. You state that there are solid reasons to scoff at Tipler. I read 
<BR>
Bostrom's and Cirkovic's paper on the FAP and found it inconsistent since 
<BR>
Tipler relies on Computational Life to alter the shape of the future, as does 
<BR>
Hans Moravec.
<BR>
<P>3. Max Tegmark finds it impossible to build Quantum computers out of plasma. 
<BR>
Yet, there is nothing in the universal constants to build non-Quantum plasma 
<BR>
computers. And who knows what we may learn in the future.  
<BR>
<P>4. As to what people do to scientific discoveries and their own belief 
<BR>
systems, adaptation or corruption has been happening for a long time. Shall 
<BR>
we disdain astronomy because the Applegate Cult used the focus on comets. Of 
<BR>
course not. Yet it will go on anyway.
<BR>
<P>5. Yes Tipler does conclude an Ontological Designer, but especially if you 
<BR>
read a recent article by Marcus Chown that even with advance in M-brane 
<BR>
theory ( I will try to look in up-came out in June) it does indicate the 
<BR>
plausibility of a designer. Yet, combined with other visions in cosmology, 
<BR>
one can also have variations in time as well as space. I am not going to 
<BR>
peddle my pamphlets at the airport and sadly concur with those who agree that 
<BR>
Mrs. God is far away in time and space and we better look out for ourselves 
<BR>
and each other. God's a few Peta-Years away, according to F.J. Tipler-don't 
<BR>
wait up.

<EM> &gt; Can't help you with this one. Tipler (in his reclusiveness) never
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; seemed to state that he believed in religion, merely that the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ultimate future appeared to closely resemble some religious aspects
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; regarding eschatology.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;He might not be saying &quot;Omega == God&quot;, but he definitely hints it
<BR>
&nbsp;extremely strongly. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Most dogmatic scientists, yes I do use that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; word, dogmatism, purposefully, simply disregard Tipler, because he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; messes with their world view. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Only partially; sure, there are plenty of physicists who think that
<BR>
&nbsp;there should be waterproof boundaries between physics and religion,
<BR>
&nbsp;but there are many other reasons to scoff at Tipler.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Of the attacks, I have seen in the last six years; most seem not to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; disagree with the physics behind it.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I have seen plenty of attacks that disagree with the physics, there
<BR>
&nbsp;are many very weak points and assumptions there. Most attackers are of
<BR>
&nbsp;course not very detailled, like the SciAm reviewer of PoI they just
<BR>
&nbsp;scoff at the notion of a supercomputer built out of nuclear plasma and
<BR>
&nbsp;simular undemonstrated wild stuff, but there has been many good points
<BR>
&nbsp;raised too (e.g. spacetime quantization, black hole horizons - and of
<BR>
&nbsp;course the open universe).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Of the attacks, I have seen in the last six years; most seem not to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; disagree with the physics behind it. But they are dead set against
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; making conclusions regarding the future universe, that might include
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; any resemblences to what religion had sugested. That is where Tipler
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; has gotten his chops busted.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Sure. But even if you disregard that, there is a lot of relevant
<BR>
&nbsp;criticism. In addition, the idea has now been adopted by many people
<BR>
&nbsp;who are twisting it to their own ends in science fiction, religion,
<BR>
&nbsp;new age or transhumanism - since it is not firmly based on observable
<BR>
&nbsp;facts, especially not in its mutated forms, it can become anything. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I *like* Tiplers calculations, they were what made me become a
<BR>
&nbsp;transhumanist. But when he tried to make the OP not just a possibility
<BR>
&nbsp;but a necessity in his cosmology, then he made a big mistake both from
<BR>
&nbsp;a science point of view and from a religious point of view.
