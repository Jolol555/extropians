</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good point!

<P>Boy you folks are making a lot of web references, no way I can currently
<BR>
spare the time for all that reading. However, Amara's reference
<BR>
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9804012">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9804012</A>, titled &quot;Consistency,
<BR>
Amplitudes and Probabilities in Quantum Theory&quot;, intrigued me. This
<BR>
paper seems to confirm what I said earlier, that the Schroedinger
<BR>
equation and other quantum ideas simply *can't* be derived by any sort
<BR>
of regular probability theory, whether cast in Bayesian logic terms or
<BR>
not! What the paper *does* say is that these quantum wave functions can
<BR>
be derived from consistency principles if the basic idea of quantum
<BR>
state vectors is first *assumed*. This derivation is meant as something
<BR>
analogous to a similarly neat derivation of Bayesian probability theory,
<BR>
but that analogy *doesn't* mean that quantum results can be completely
<BR>
derived *from* ordinary probabilities! As I mentioned before, this
<BR>
assumption that state vectors must be *squared* to get probabilities for
<BR>
the location of a particle, *this* is something strange in any regular
<BR>
probability terms, and hard to interpret, if you are wondering whether
<BR>
the state vectors, and the resulting waveforms, are real or not.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; - But Goldstein asks: Does Zeilinger truly believe that ``quantum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is about information''? Information is always information about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Therefore, shouldn't quantum mechanics then be regarded as being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about that something? And does Zeilinger really wish to deny that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; change of the state vector that occurs during the measurement process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is ``a real physical process,'' even when it leads to the destruction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possibility of interference? Can quantum interference be genuinely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understood by invoking a wavefunction that is nothing more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``a representation of our knowledge''?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, well, I'd have to agree with Goldstein, quantum interference and
<BR>
superpositions and such, they aren't really covered by standard methods
<BR>
of updating one's statistical knowledge, right (scerir's quotations from
<BR>
Heisenberg and others notwithstanding)? The question, I suppose, is
<BR>
whether we could regard the handling of quantum vectors as simply a sort
<BR>
of more generalized statistics method, so that &quot;possible positions&quot; of a
<BR>
particle can actually interfere, without the vectors that cause this
<BR>
being locally real at all! In other words, the quantum state vectors are
<BR>
only a particularly advanced kind of knowledge representation, a sort of
<BR>
pure math structure to help us to relate to real particles and their
<BR>
tricky quantum ways?
<BR>
<P>In response to this thought about quantum effects being &quot;only advanced
<BR>
statistics&quot;, it certainly occurs to me that the special quantum
<BR>
properties are said to be of use (at least in theory), in performing
<BR>
certain types of computations that would take far too long on any sort
<BR>
of regular, &quot;classical&quot; kind of computer. Apparently, special circuitry
<BR>
can be built to handle a great many digital numbers, all at once, all
<BR>
quantum superposed on the same register! The practical disadvantage here
<BR>
is that, to actually measure one number, you tend to cause all the
<BR>
others to decohere or &quot;collapse&quot;. Even so, it's said that this can be
<BR>
handled in such a way as to say, efficiently do an &quot;all at once&quot; Fast
<BR>
Fourier Transform on some sequence of numbers that might be generated
<BR>
from a number theory formula of some kind. Now, I'm not trying to get
<BR>
into great details, the reference here is a paper that I once
<BR>
downloaded, called &quot;Quantum Physics and Computers&quot; by Adriano Barenco,
<BR>
if anyone wants to look it up.
<BR>
<P>As I understand things, it happens that by the above mentioned methods,
<BR>
one ought to be able to efficiently factor very large numbers, and even
<BR>
break enciphered messages based on the difficulty of such factorization.
<BR>
Does this sound like the sort of thing that would come out of a mere
<BR>
&quot;gambler's computer&quot; of sorts, with probability analysis of a randomized
<BR>
computer circuit allowing great gains over conventional computers?
<BR>
Surely it sounds a lot more as though these &quot;qubit&quot; superpositions are
<BR>
going to be a very careful handling of *real* quantum state properties,
<BR>
with the quantum vectors as a *real* mechanism for doing real
<BR>
computations? In particular, the tendency of the quantum vectors to
<BR>
interfere at specific locations is very important, this in itself
<BR>
amounts to a kind of computation, and the computation has to be
<BR>
happening locally, where the vectors are located! In comparison, if one
<BR>
were simply classically uncertain about the position of a particle,
<BR>
let's say, there is no way that two possible different positions of the
<BR>
particle would go right out to some spot and partially or totally cancel
<BR>
one another! I'm being intuitive here, I suppose, much in the manner of
<BR>
Goldstein's comments above -- I just don't see that classical statistics
<BR>
uncertainties would amount to any such manner of local
<BR>
interference-based computing.
<BR>
<P>Classically, one could add all sorts of possible positions to a density
<BR>
function, but such additions wouldn't ever tend to create relatively
<BR>
blank spots, or interference bands. Again, remember that in quantum
<BR>
theory, one must square the magnitude of a complex vector in order to
<BR>
even begin to get a probability density. So the _idea that these vectors
<BR>
just represent a probability is wrong, both intuitively and
<BR>
mathematically_. The quantum vectors seem to be something mechanical or
<BR>
mechanistic in nature; you really have to add all the relevant vectors
<BR>
together *first* then *square* the final result to get any sort of
<BR>
probability for finding a particle as such. To put it another way, if
<BR>
you get more *out* of the quantum computer than you put *in*, that
<BR>
should surely prove that the real computing isn't all going on in your
<BR>
personal Bayesian viewpoint on the matter. If the &quot;qubit advantage&quot; is
<BR>
purely in the analysis of it, then why build a &quot;qubit computer&quot; at all?
<BR>
Why not just *imagine* the qubits, then, and factor large numbers by
<BR>
using just the imaginary Bayesian descriptions of this?
