INSTRUMENTS OF MIND

<BR>
<P>Cognitive Technology is concerned with the interaction between two worlds:
<BR>
that of the mind and that of the machine.
<BR>
In science and engineering, this interaction is often explored by posing the
<BR>
question: how can technology be best tailored to human cognition? But as the
<BR>
history of technological developments has consistently shown, cognition is
<BR>
also fashioned by technology. Technologies as diverse as writing,
<BR>
electricity generation and the silicon chip all illustrate the profound and
<BR>
dynamic impact of technology upon ourselves and our conceptions of the
<BR>
world. The instruments afforded by these technologies continue to evolve and
<BR>
to shape the minds that first conceived them.
<BR>
<P>The technologies of the third millennium promise mind-machine interactions
<BR>
of unprecedented intimacy and subtlety. These interactions embrace radically
<BR>
new kinds of experience that force us to re-examine fundamental concepts of
<BR>
embodiment and consciousness which frame our understanding of the
<BR>
relationship between minds and machines. The implications of these
<BR>
interactions will hinge on the ways in which humans make meanings out of
<BR>
these new experiences. This conference will address this issue using the
<BR>
diverse perspectives afforded by a wide range of disciplines, and evidence
<BR>
drawn from both contemporary developments and the history of technology. Its
<BR>
aim is to deepen our insight into the potential influence of current and
<BR>
future technologies over people and society.
<BR>
<P>The conference will focus on the core question of how technology contributes
<BR>
to the making of meaning. 'The making of meaning' is to be broadly
<BR>
interpreted as referring to all the activities by which significance is
<BR>
attached to the actions of people and machines engaging with a technology.
<BR>
For a new technology, meaning is in the first instance associated with
<BR>
intended and preconceived applications. The contribution of technology to
<BR>
the making of meaning through these processes has been analysed in many
<BR>
ways: in the design and creation of technologies and artefacts themselves;
<BR>
in the psychological, sociological and historical analysis of their
<BR>
individual and corporate use; and in the philosophical implications for our
<BR>
modes of thought and ways of communicating.
<BR>
<P>A proper understanding of the processes of mutual co-evolution and
<BR>
adaptation which shape our interaction with the technology of the computer
<BR>
age will ultimately require a holistic rather than a reductionist approach.
<BR>
Given our current understanding of these matters, an integrative and
<BR>
holistic account is inevitably a long term ambition, but it is an ambition
<BR>
which must not be forgotten. With this in mind, the organisers invite papers
<BR>
which address the core question of how technology affects the making of
<BR>
meaning from the following perspectives. Papers which take both an empirical
<BR>
approach and a more analytical or philosophical approach are welcome. For
<BR>
further information on relevant topics in the areas of &quot;The Personal and the
<BR>
Experiential&quot;, &quot;The Social&quot;, &quot;The History of Technology&quot;, &quot;Education and
<BR>
Individual Development&quot;, &quot;Creating, Designing and Engineering&quot;, please
