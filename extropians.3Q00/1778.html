<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In a discussion in another forum, the question of whether computers have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;found&quot; valid mathematical proofs has come up.
</EM><BR>
<P>The trivial example is chess, where modern computers have proven
<BR>
or disproven contentions by grandmasters about an unclear position.
<BR>
The classic example is the 20th game in the 1972 championship between
<BR>
Spassky and Fischer where Spassky suddenly resigned in a very
<BR>
unsettled situation.  The top guys argued about it for years, but many
<BR>
contended that Boris had a shot that would have given him an excellent
<BR>
chance for at least a draw.  Deep Blue &quot;proved&quot; by exhaustive 30 ply
<BR>
analysis (which is beyond human capacity) that the commie in fact
<BR>
resigned in a winning position, fully convinced that he was busted.
<BR>
Fischer had that effect on his opponents.  But he would *not* have
<BR>
so effected a cold blooded computer.
