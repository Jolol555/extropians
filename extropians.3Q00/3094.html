Well, it looks like Steve Moyer is gonna have me on his radio show in
<BR>
Burlington, VT on thursday afternoon (thats when the taping is, at
<BR>
least, not sure if its live). The show is Election 2000, and it turns
<BR>
out Steve is running as an independent against Senator Jeffords for the
<BR>
US Senate, and he host other politicians and pundits on his show. We've
<BR>
been talking over email about ethanol technology, education, health
<BR>
care, and other issues. One thing that interested him was the idea I had
<BR>
suggested that since many grain silos around the country tend to wind up
<BR>
with grain just rotting because the market  price is too low, that
<BR>
installing small 'microbrew' type ethanol distilleries at grain silos to
<BR>
supply local demand for fuel while helping to stabilize the grain market
<BR>
at the same time by eliminating any surpluses of unsalable grain might
<BR>
be a good market solution to the need for lower cost fuels and eliminate
<BR>
the need for subsidy. I'm aware that using standard
<BR>
fermentation/distillation sytems probably has significant losses. Spike,
<BR>
didn't you do some calculations on conversion of grain to ethanol a
<BR>
short while back? What conversion efficiency were you talking about and
<BR>
what technology were you basing that on? Are you aware of any
<BR>
technologies that would be more efficient than yeast based fermentation?

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)

never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
