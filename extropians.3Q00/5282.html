<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One of my side-lines, that I mentioned here a while back, is writing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; books for children, primarily aged 4 to 8, on extropian topics.  My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific reviewers love them, but I haven't found a publisher yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Way to go!  Good luck with finding a publisher!  I'd sure love
<BR>
to get a copy of anything you might have on those lines.  Please keep
<BR>
me posted about your work and progress!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me, this kind of work is the most important work
<BR>
any of us extropians could do.  Our children are depending on us to
<BR>
save them from this deathist society.  How will we feel if we are
<BR>
resurrected from cryonic preservation, and see how much we failed so
<BR>
many of our children and how much more we could have done to save so
<BR>
many more of them via this kind of work for our children?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dependent on them to resurrect us, but many of them are
<BR>
also depending on us!  We are all dependent on each other.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
