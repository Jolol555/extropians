Actually, I just remembered one of the best examples of teleoperation, which 
<BR>
was written up in the Orange County Register a few years ago.  Locally, Loma 
<BR>
Linda University worked with a quadrapleagic kid to give him mobility via a 
<BR>
4X4 battery-operated model, on which they mounted a camera, microphone and 
<BR>
speaker.  The kid could follow his mother around the house or neighborhood, 
<BR>
listening and carrying on a conversation, or play soccer with his buddies 
<BR>
outside, all while confined to his wheelchair.  Unfortunately, they ran out 
<BR>
of funding and had to discontinue the project.
<BR>
<P>It occurred to me years before that that you could mount a camera on one of 
<BR>
those trained helper dogs, and do the same thing.  As I recall, the Germans 
<BR>
tried that in WWI in trench warfare, with radio-controlled dogs carrying 
<BR>
bombs.  Unfortunately for the controllers, however, they had not trained the 
<BR>
dogs to ignore shells bursting around them at close range, so the dogs fled 
<BR>
back to the controllers.  The bombs were apparently on timers....
