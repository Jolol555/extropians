<EM>&gt; Yes, that makes sense; organizing in a group amplifies your power, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good or evil.  However corporations and other groups are not inherently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil or wrong, any more than are other power amplification systems like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science and technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>These power amplification systems aren't neutral. They amplify different
<BR>
powers differently and some people's power more than others. So I think
<BR>
there are two cases that can be made for the corporation (or science and
<BR>
technology for that matter) being inherently evil. First, one can argue
<BR>
that it amplifies the powers for doing evil more than the powers for
<BR>
doing good.  And second, they can increase inequality, which some
<BR>
consider an evil. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; A lot of evil contributed to big corporations seem to consist of
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
Of course I meant to write &quot;attributed&quot; here.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; situations where two parties voluntarily cooporate on some effort, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because one of the parties is in a significantly weaker bargaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; position (because of market conditions, lack of information, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whatever), most of the benefit deriving from the effort goes to the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; party (i.e. shareholders of the corporation). Is it evil to take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMO it is not evil to engage in interactions which are voluntary for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all parties.  As I understand these situations, the &quot;victim&quot; actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has his situation improved, but just not as much as the victimizer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However I know that many people have a different intuition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There was an article in the 3/28/98 issue of Science News about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiments in a game where there is a sum of money which will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; divided between two people.  The first person makes an offer to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; second person of how the money should be split, and the second person
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agrees or not.  If he agrees they both get the money and it is split
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; according to the offer.  If he disagrees, neither gets the money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The first person has all the leverage in this game; he can keep almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the money and offer a pittance to the second player, and it is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the second player's advantage to accept.  However in practice, if he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; offers too little, the second player will refuse.  Most people offer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a substantial fraction to the second player, 30% or more, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usually accepted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems that most people have instinctive beliefs about fair behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in situations of unequal power.  Applied to the case of corporations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they consider it wrong for corporations to use their market power to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; help themselves, even when they do so only by offering lesser advantages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to others.  Microsoft is a good current example.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that people have instinctive beliefs about fair behavior in
<BR>
situations of unequal power, but I'm not sure this experiment reveals
<BR>
much about them. I'll have to get the actual article from my
<BR>
library. A lot depends on the exact setup of the experiment. How much
<BR>
money was involved, whether it's completely anonymous, etc.  An
<BR>
explanation not involving fairness may be that the second player is
<BR>
trying to maintain his reputation for not being a pushover or has a
<BR>
behavior pattern that's primarily used for that purpose. In which case I
<BR>
would predict that the percentage offered to the second player would
<BR>
decrease as the total amount of money increased.
<BR>
<P>It's a good thing that these kinds of studies are being done though. 
<BR>
It would be interesting to know where people's instincts about fairness
<BR>
come from.
