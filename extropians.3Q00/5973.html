This article on Asian Swamp Eels struck me as one which some other 
<BR>
extropians might enjoy.  Specifically, I was wondering if anyone has any 
<BR>
ideas on how their expansion could be slowed or stopped.  They're amazingly 
<BR>
resilient, as you'll see below.

<P>A Plague of Asian Eels Highlights
<BR>
The Damage From Foreign Species
<BR>
By MARK ROBICHAUX
<BR>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
<BR>
<P>MIRAMAR, Fla. -- An aluminum boat carrying federal
<BR>
biologists roars down Canal C-9, a 20-mile-long
<BR>
waterway that passes a stone's throw from Pro Player
<BR>
Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.
<BR>
<P>The boat, which is equipped with an &quot;electro-fishing
<BR>
unit,&quot; slows to a stop, and one of the men lowers two
<BR>
chandeliers of thick wires into the water. With the
<BR>
press of a pedal, he unleashes up to 800 volts into
<BR>
the murky depths. The scientists are stalking one of
<BR>
the newest, most indestructible aquatic predators in
<BR>
the U.S.: the Asian swamp eel.
<BR>
<P>The more scientists learn about the eel, Monopterus
<BR>
albus, the more discouraged they become about stopping
<BR>
it. Here is what is known so far: It has a bottomless
<BR>
appetite for any aquatic life in its path -- fish,
<BR>
frogs, shrimp, crayfish and insects. A nocturnal
<BR>
hunter, it is rarely seen by humans. The
<BR>
three-foot-long adults have no known natural enemies,
<BR>
with the possible exception of alligators.
<BR>
<P>By Land or by Sea
<BR>
<P>The eel's most alarming trait, though, is its uncanny
<BR>
ability to survive extreme conditions. In one study by
<BR>
a Harvard zoologist, an Asian swamp eel lived seven
<BR>
months in a damp towel without food or water. The
<BR>
olive-brown creature prefers tropical waters, yet it
<BR>
can flourish in sub-zero temperatures. It prefers
<BR>
fresh water but can tolerate high salinity. It
<BR>
breathes under water like a fish, but can slither
<BR>
across dry land, sometimes in packs of 50 or more,
<BR>
sucking air through a two-holed snout. It breeds
<BR>
year-round, with one eel laying as many as 1,000 eggs
<BR>
at a time. No mates nearby? No problem: Almost
<BR>
magically -- scientists still don't know how -- the
<BR>
eel can change into a female from a male. Even more of
<BR>
a riddle is how to kill the eel: It thus far appears
<BR>
almost immune to poisons and dynamite.
<BR>
<P><P>Asian swamp eel
<BR>
<P>&quot;We can't find a chink in its armor,&quot; says Leo Nico, a
<BR>
biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, the
<BR>
nation's largest water, earth and biological science
<BR>
agency.
<BR>
<P>As if this weren't cause enough for concern, the eel
<BR>
is now within a mile of the ecologically fragile
<BR>
Everglades National Park, a 1.5 million-acre oasis of
<BR>
rare plants, animals and fish, and the subtropical
<BR>
jewel of America's park system. If the eels reach the
<BR>
park, there's a chance they could start gobbling their
<BR>
way through one of America's most-threatened
<BR>
ecosystems.
<BR>
<P>The tale of the eel's discovery in the U.S. offers a
<BR>
window into one of the most vexing problems facing the
<BR>
environment in America today, rivaling wildfires,
<BR>
logging, flooding, earthquakes or tornadoes in sheer
<BR>
economic damage -- the vast and silent explosion of
<BR>
invasive species. In a trend accelerated by the
<BR>
globalization of the world economy, about 50,000
<BR>
introduced and invasive nonnative species have entered
<BR>
the U.S. to date. Some, such as corn, wheat, rice,
<BR>
cattle and poultry, proved their value to the economy
<BR>
and culture long ago.
<BR>
<P>But the problems caused by other newer invaders are
<BR>
taking their toll. Introduced and invasive species
<BR>
cost the U.S. an estimated $138 billion annually
<BR>
according to a study last year by four researchers at
<BR>
Cornell University.
<BR>
<P>In Louisiana, for instance, Formosan termites chew up
<BR>
historic homes in the French quarter of New Orleans
<BR>
and a sheriff's SWAT team shoots beaver-size,
<BR>
nonnative swamp rats from South America overtaking
<BR>
drainage canals. Suppressing a 1996 infestation of
<BR>
Asian long-horned beetles in New York City cost the
<BR>
state and federal governments more than $4 million. In
<BR>
the Great Lakes, Zebra mussels introduced by Russian
<BR>
freighters in 1986 now cause an estimated $5 billion
<BR>
in damage annually to pipes, boats and other
<BR>
structures. Exotic weeds and plants -- a particular
<BR>
nuisance to Western ranchers -- are expanding their
<BR>
range at a rate of 4,600 acres a day.
<BR>
<P>The environmental cost, meanwhile, is incalculable.
<BR>
Nonindigenous species disrupt delicate food webs and
<BR>
upset rare breeding sites. About 42% of the species
<BR>
listed as endangered or threatened under the
<BR>
Endangered Species Act are there because of
<BR>
competition or predation by foreign species. And
<BR>
there's no end in sight: Every minute, 40,000 gallons
<BR>
of ballast water are dumped into U.S. harbors, some of
<BR>
it containing exotic organisms that could alter or
<BR>
destroy marine ecosystems, according to the Department
<BR>
of Commerce. Even baby's breath, the tiny white
<BR>
flowers from Eurasia that float on a bride's veil, is
<BR>
a menace to unique habitats in the West.
<BR>
<P>Concerned about the federal and state governments'
<BR>
scattershot and overlapping response to the problem,
<BR>
President Clinton 18 months ago signed an executive
<BR>
order creating the National Invasive Species Council,
<BR>
for the first time coordinating the efforts of 20
<BR>
federal agencies. In a detailed &quot;management report&quot; to
<BR>
be released next week for public comment, the council
<BR>
outlines ambitious plans to create an early-detection
<BR>
team, educate the public, strengthen import controls
<BR>
and design an online database of species where
<BR>
scientists around the world can share information.
<BR>
<P>&quot;America's landscape is being transformed by swamp
<BR>
eels, cheatgrass and a host of other creatures and
<BR>
weeds that don't belong,&quot; Secretary of the Interior
<BR>
Bruce Babbitt said in a written response to questions.
<BR>
&quot;The national invasive species plan now being proposed
<BR>
is a big, first step in turning back this unwelcome
<BR>
tide.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The Asian swamp eel would still be in hiding today
<BR>
were it not for the abiding curiosity of a Smithsonian
<BR>
Institution scientist named Wayne Starnes, who
<BR>
discovered the eel on the North American continent.
<BR>
Along the way, a hurricane, a part-time snail
<BR>
specialist, a student in Jakarta, and a spontaneous
<BR>
roadside stop by a piranha expert all played a crucial
<BR>
role in understanding what scientists know so far
<BR>
about the species.
<BR>
<P>In late September 1994, Mr. Starnes, an ichthyologist
<BR>
with a Ph.D. in ecology, flew to Atlanta from his
<BR>
Washington lab for a conference sponsored by the
<BR>
American Zoological Association, where he was eager to
<BR>
pitch a book project on freshwater fish. One evening,
<BR>
on a lark, he joined his co-author, a professional
<BR>
nature photographer named Dick Bryant, in a 20-minute
<BR>
drive north of Atlanta to judge a nature photography
<BR>
contest at the Chatahoochee Nature Center, a log-cabin
<BR>
style museum surrounded by ponds and winding trails.
<BR>
While touring the exhibits at night with a staffer, he
<BR>
noticed a dish on a table that held a three-inch worm
<BR>
as thin &quot;as a thick pencil lead.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Where did you get this?&quot; he asked the staffer.
<BR>
Earlier in the day, children were collecting bugs and
<BR>
crawfish and &quot;these worms&quot; to study in the center, the
<BR>
man replied. Mr. Starnes lifted the dish to his eyes.
<BR>
It looked like a tiny eel, he said to himself. But
<BR>
American eels wouldn't be this far inland -- they
<BR>
spawn in the ocean. Was it a siren, the eel-shaped
<BR>
salamander with no hind legs, or perhaps a Southern
<BR>
Brook Lamprey, which is native to the Chatahoochee
<BR>
River?
<BR>
<P>Dr. Starnes slipped the eel in a small vial with
<BR>
formaldehyde and carried it in his briefcase back to
<BR>
the lab at the Smithsonian in Washington. Adjusting
<BR>
the focus of the microscope, Mr. Starnes stared at the
<BR>
eel and whispered to himself, &quot;Oh man, I've seen this
<BR>
face before.&quot; It was the same family of eels he had
<BR>
seen on research trips to South America and Central
<BR>
America. This particular family of eels is also found
<BR>
in India, African swamps and flooded rice fields in
<BR>
Asia. The eels had been spotted in Hawaii years ago.
<BR>
<P>Crash Diet
<BR>
<P>To further educate himself, Mr. Starnes relied on
<BR>
several early eel studies, including one by a Harvard
<BR>
professor named Karel Liem, whose research reached
<BR>
back to the 1960s. Prof. Liem's own first encounter
<BR>
with the eels was memorable: As a graduate student at
<BR>
the University of Indonesia in Jakarta, he traveled
<BR>
one night in 1961 to a swamp to collect frogs for his
<BR>
thesis project. Suddenly, his headlamp lit up a herd
<BR>
of eels moving across land. Shocked and intrigued, &quot;I
<BR>
collected 87 live specimens in maybe less than an
<BR>
hour,&quot; he said. He's studied them ever since, focusing
<BR>
on their amazing resilience. In one landmark study, he
<BR>
starved 40 eels for as long as seven months to gauge
<BR>
their ability to survive prolonged drought and food
<BR>
deprivation.
<BR>
<P>Still curious about the eels, Mr. Starnes flew back to
<BR>
the nature center in Georgia in August 1996, where he
<BR>
met with two men from the Georgia Department of
<BR>
Natural Resources. They were armed with backpack
<BR>
electro-fishing devices, which momentarily stun fish.
<BR>
At the first crackle of electricity, Mr. Starnes
<BR>
quickly saw the orange bellies of three-foot adult
<BR>
eels as they turned rigid in the murky water. &quot;They
<BR>
were thick as hair on a dog's back in there,&quot; he
<BR>
recalls. After two hours, they collected 24 eels from
<BR>
three ponds. Mr. Starnes found sunfish and bass in the
<BR>
eels' bellies, and the ponds were depleted of smaller
<BR>
fish.
<BR>
<P>In the fall of 1997, Mr. Starnes returned to the site
<BR>
with the Georgia DNR, and shocked and scooped up 19
<BR>
eels. More troubling to Mr. Starnes, though, was the
<BR>
fact that the tropically inclined eels had survived a
<BR>
bitter winter in the Atlanta area that paved ponds
<BR>
with a foot of ice. Mr. Starnes, who by then had taken
<BR>
a job as research curator of fishes at the North
<BR>
Carolina Science Museum, put the eels in a large tank
<BR>
to observe. All of Mr. Starnes's notes jibed with Mr.
<BR>
Liem's observation 40 years earlier. &quot;The limits of
<BR>
their gluttony are hard to establish,&quot; he wrote in a
<BR>
paper with Mr. Bryant and others. In captivity, they
<BR>
will eat &quot;minnow after minnow.&quot; Particularly eerie was
<BR>
to &quot;walk into a room and have five ominous heads rise
<BR>
to the surface, orient your presence, and follow you
<BR>
about the room with almost demanding expectancy.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A second population wasn't revealed until three years
<BR>
later, in June 1997, nearly 700 miles southeast of
<BR>
Atlanta. A Florida International University student
<BR>
named Carol Curtis was studying electric knifefish,
<BR>
another exotic species. She netted several small baby
<BR>
swamp eels in a pond that drains into a waterway known
<BR>
as canal C-9, north of Miami. She was collecting
<BR>
samples of water hyacinth, an invasive flower species,
<BR>
for her aquarium. The eel found its way to FIU Prof.
<BR>
Joel Trexler, who has a doctorate in biology. &quot;The
<BR>
minute I saw it, I knew it was not from here,&quot; he
<BR>
said.
<BR>
<P>Yet another group of eels emerged around the same
<BR>
time. While driving home to Gainesville, Fla., from a
<BR>
boating seminar in St. Petersburg, Mr. Nico, the
<BR>
federal biologist, wondered if the roadside ditches
<BR>
held any Oriental weatherfish -- a peculiar specimen
<BR>
he was researching whose behavior allegedly can
<BR>
predict weather. In a rural area southeast of Tampa
<BR>
Bay, he eased onto the shoulder of the road and pulled
<BR>
out his pole-nets.
<BR>
<P>Killer Fire Ants
<BR>
<P>Mr. Nico, who wrote his thesis on piranhas in South
<BR>
America, knew the area held promise. South Florida is
<BR>
a mecca for more than 100 uninvited, or nonnative,
<BR>
species. Fire ants from South America, for example,
<BR>
harass homeowners, even killing an elderly woman there
<BR>
earlier this year. Melaleuca trees from Australia dry
<BR>
up the Everglades, lowering the water table and
<BR>
creating a fire hazard. In the ditch, Mr. Nico scooped
<BR>
up several Oriental weatherfish and two wriggling
<BR>
eels, each about a foot long. Fascinated, he took them
<BR>
back to the lab at the Florida Caribbean Science
<BR>
Center, where he correctly identified them as Asian
<BR>
swamp eels, a species he studied as a student in South
<BR>
America.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Nico's boss, USGS branch chief Jim Williams, made
<BR>
the connection with the Georgia eels immediately --
<BR>
Mr. Starnes was a buddy from years back. News of the
<BR>
eels spread slowly on the scientific grapevine, and a
<BR>
network of scientists formed. Mr. Starnes flew down to
<BR>
Florida to study specimens in the FIU lab. Meanwhile,
<BR>
Prof. Trexler asked his students visiting home in
<BR>
Southern China -- where eels are sold in baskets of
<BR>
grass as food items -- to bring back specimens for
<BR>
comparison. And Mr. Nico brought back some tissue
<BR>
samples of baby eels from Venezuela.
<BR>
<P>That spring, Mr. Nico sampled the C-9 canal in North
<BR>
Miami, a virtual freeway for exotic fish in Florida.
<BR>
Mr. Nico and his team found &quot;dozens of eels of all
<BR>
different sizes&quot; -- the biggest infestation yet. Mr.
<BR>
Nico began surveying every month with the
<BR>
electro-fishing boat, which stuns fish in a 10-foot
<BR>
radius long enough to net them.
<BR>
<P>Off With Their Heads
<BR>
<P>Even with all the technology, the eels are extremely
<BR>
difficult to grab. On a recent return to the site, the
<BR>
boat driver yelled directions to the two men manning
<BR>
the nets. &quot;There he goes! Behind that rock! On the
<BR>
bank!&quot; On a small table on the bank, Jeffrey Herod,
<BR>
clad in a long blue plastic apron, called out the
<BR>
weight and length of each eel. Using a small pair of
<BR>
shears, he cut off the heads, which are helpful in
<BR>
gauging the eels' age. &quot;Watch out for these boys,&quot; Mr.
<BR>
Herod said to his staff. &quot;They're bleeders.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Soon several agencies pitched in with research and
<BR>
sampling, including the Florida Fish and Wildlife
<BR>
Conservation Commission, the South Florida Water
<BR>
Management District, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
<BR>
Service, the National Park Service, as well as the
<BR>
USGS offices in the Caribbean Science Center and the
<BR>
Everglades.
<BR>
<P>Despite the number of experts involved, though, basic
<BR>
questions remained unanswered. How did the eel get
<BR>
here? How fast and how far can it spread? How do we
<BR>
get rid of it? Theories on their entry are many. The
<BR>
eels could be unwanted aquarium pets dumped into the
<BR>
wild -- pet stores sell baby eels nearby -- or
<BR>
escapees from an aquarium-fish farm, say, during a
<BR>
flood. Another theory is the eels were intentionally
<BR>
introduced as food by Asian immigrants. Considered a
<BR>
delicacy, the eels are cut up in sections, either
<BR>
grilled or stir fried, and served over rice, usually
<BR>
with a sauce.
<BR>
<P>On Sept. 23, 1998, the Florida scientists flew to
<BR>
Washington to inform executives at the Department of
<BR>
the Interior. Afterwards, the eels were listed by the
<BR>
Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, a group of seven
<BR>
federal agencies dedicated to control aquatic
<BR>
nuisances. &quot;The question everybody wanted answered is
<BR>
this: Is there any way to keep this from getting into
<BR>
the park? There was a real desire to contain it or
<BR>
even eradicate it,&quot; says Prof. Trexler, who attended
<BR>
the meeting. Among the ideas: a network of underwater
<BR>
electronic fences in strategic locations, similar to
<BR>
the ones used in the Great Lakes region to contain the
<BR>
spread of lamprey eels. The interior department &quot;took
<BR>
it seriously from the beginning,&quot; says Prof. Trexler.
<BR>
&quot;They said they'd do everything they can to keep it
<BR>
out of the park. I was amazed at the high level of
<BR>
concern.&quot; But the meeting didn't change Mr. Nico's
<BR>
mind. &quot;I just didn't think it could be contained.&quot;
<BR>
<P>'Snakes' in the Nursery
<BR>
<P>Hurricane Irene slammed the Florida keys in the fall
<BR>
of 1999, dumping more than a foot of rain in the Miami
<BR>
area. In Homestead, pastures turned into lakes. Canals
<BR>
flooded over banks. One alarmed owner of a nursery
<BR>
reported several &quot;snakes&quot; around his business, where
<BR>
large potted palms are sold. Bill Loftas, a senior
<BR>
USGS scientist in the Everglades, investigated. He
<BR>
found his first swamp eel run over in the nursery. The
<BR>
next day, with Mr. Trexler, Mr. Loftas found three
<BR>
dead eels and a live one. More questions demanded
<BR>
attention: Had the eel moved across land? Were these
<BR>
eels from the same family in Miami or in Tampa or even
<BR>
Georgia? Or were they a new population?
<BR>
<P>This past winter, concerned that the eel had already
<BR>
breached the park, Mr. Loftas took the electro-fishing
<BR>
unit in a marsh boat and searched for hours with an
<BR>
FIU postdoctoral intern. They found nothing. &quot;But that
<BR>
that doesn't mean they're not there.&quot; Like many of the
<BR>
scientists studying the eel, he believes quick action
<BR>
is critical. &quot;This is not a lot of arm waving,&quot; said
<BR>
Mr. Trexler. &quot;This is a real threat.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Over Christmas, Mr. Trexler kept the eel tissue
<BR>
samples from the nursery in his freezer and called Tim
<BR>
Collins, snail specialist and a molecular systematist
<BR>
at FIU. &quot;Could you throw this into your works?&quot; Mr.
<BR>
Trexler asked him. Mr. Collins conducted DNA tests
<BR>
through the Christmas break. &quot;When we found the
<BR>
answer, we were floored,&quot; said Mr. Trexler. The eels
<BR>
were a &quot;separate introduction&quot; from previously
<BR>
discovered populations in Georgia, North Miami, and
<BR>
Tampa. After extensive DNA testing, they concluded
<BR>
four different introductions of eels had occurred in
<BR>
the U.S.
<BR>
<P>After a flurry of exchanged e-mails, phone calls and
<BR>
faxes, state and federal biologists agreed to gather
<BR>
in January at FIU to draw up a plan to deal with the
<BR>
eel. Meetings continued through the winter and spring.
<BR>
Today, USGS scientists, working with researchers at
<BR>
FIU and biologists from the Florida Fish and Wildlife
<BR>
Conservation Commission, are actively and regularly
<BR>
searching waters where the eels were previously found.
<BR>
The USGS is preparing a rapid response team to find
<BR>
and &quot;contain&quot; the eel.
<BR>
<P>But killing the eels, which are estimated to number in
<BR>
the tens of thousands in the U.S. now, may prove
<BR>
tricky. Dynamite, a crude but effective way to kill
<BR>
fish, doesn't work well on eels because they lack the
<BR>
large air bladder that makes fish susceptible to
<BR>
concussion blasts, and they can retreat to their
<BR>
burrows. Poisoning the entire length of the infested
<BR>
canals still wouldn't kill all eels. In tests using
<BR>
rotenone, a poison that makes it impossible for fish
<BR>
to use oxygen, the eels simply raise their snouts
<BR>
above water and breathe air.
<BR>
<P>Any such efforts would certainly incite protest over
<BR>
the Everglades. Just two years ago in California, the
<BR>
state Game and Fish Commission poisoned Lake Davis --
<BR>
the entire lake -- to rid it of northern pike, worried
<BR>
they'd become a threat to native trout. Protests, loud
<BR>
and long, continue today. &quot;Which is worse?&quot; asks Mr.
<BR>
Trexler. &quot;The spread of the invader or the risk
<BR>
associated with containing it?&quot;
