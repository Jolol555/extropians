Emlyn has written,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is actually my full point that you can't grok your 3-month old self. Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't we have any memories of that age?
</EM><BR>
<P>Many people *do* have memories of that age. You might try hypnosis and age
<BR>
regression.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I wonder if we can't remember what it was like to be that age, because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points of view of an adult and a 3-month old are so disparate; maybe there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just no way to model what it is like to be 3 months old, so you lose the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information, save for the odd, mostly untrustworthy, flash or vision.
</EM><BR>
<P>A meditation exercise that some have found useful is to regress to 3-months or
<BR>
younger. The ability of the human brain to remember is surprising to anyone who
<BR>
hasn't tried it. People don't remember the first three or four years of life
<BR>
because, as you point out, those times are so very different from adult
<BR>
experience, and also because those years are painful in many ways. We tend not
<BR>
to remember pain.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm thinking that an SI, even one which is technically an augmented human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (ie: take raw human adult, add technology, iterate), may have the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble with grokking grown up humans, that we have with our littlest folk;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surely, after all, the gap in mental power is similar.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's right, and remember that an adult has a better concept of what it's
<BR>
like to be an infant than an infant has of what it's like to be an adult. An
<BR>
important element of enlightenment for people to consider is that enlightened
<BR>
masters understand the unenlightened infinitely more accurately than the
<BR>
unenlightened can ever understand enlightened masters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's pretty much impossible to understand/experience being smarter than you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are, to any large degree. Maybe it is likewise as difficult to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand/experience being dumber (outside of a small range)?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's like someone who has never had vision trying to understand what sight is
<BR>
like. Much easier for a sighted person to understand blindness.
<BR>

<P><P><P>WEDW 9/28/00 - 6:48 PM... to each other about what it was that they touched. The
<BR>
web is a lot of different things to a lot of different people. According to some
<BR>
it a communications device, according to others it's an information gathering
<BR>
system. It's the beginning of artificial intelligence. It's a huge
<BR>
communications vehicle. Maybe a direct marketing vehicle. What is the web? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
The web is just one part of something very radical that's happening and it's a
<BR>
changing civilization. It's about the fact that the human brain is very special.
<BR>
If you can get more content in the human brain, you don't saturate it, you can
<BR>
get more pretty. The web is more way, one way of getting more information. You
<BR>
have digital tv. You go back 50 years, you came into an accountant firm, you
<BR>
opened up ten letters in your mornings, that was your work. Now we all get vast
<BR>
amounts of e-mail, phone messages, it all about this fundamental change, which
<BR>
is using people's brains more because those are actually the scarce resource. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
So what is one of the outcomes of allowing more...
