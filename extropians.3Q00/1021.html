<P>Up to now, for cryoprotection Alcor has cannulated the heart, via median
<BR>
sternotomy (open chest surgery).  This was more difficult than cannulating
<BR>
the carotid arteries, but absolutely necessary to make sure that the brain
<BR>
was well perfused.  Even if both carotids are cannulated, only the front
<BR>
half of the brain is likely to be perfused in a large percentage of the
<BR>
population.  This is due to the fact that about 20% of the population does
<BR>
not have an intact Circle of Willis (vessels that feed other vessels in the
<BR>
brain, leading to complete brain perfusion).  In cryotransport patients,
<BR>
the percentage is likely to be far higher (according to the neurosurgeon
<BR>
that works with Alcor) due to the fact that elderly, diseased patients are
<BR>
more likely to have atherosclerosis or aneurisms causing damage to this
<BR>
rather small and delicate structure.
<BR>
<P>Because Alcor does not want to subject any of its patients to a large
<BR>
probability of not having a good perfusion and protection for the brain,
<BR>
the median sternotomy has been used.  By cannulating the heart, blood goes
<BR>
to the brain up both carotids and both vertebral arteries, making an intact
<BR>
Circle of Willis unnecessary for complete perfusion of the brain.
<BR>
<P>Up until now, we have had no choice but to cannulate the heart in order to
<BR>
perfuse the brain through both carotids and vertebrals.  This was the case
<BR>
because cannulating the vertebrals seemed impossible (they run through the
<BR>
vertebra, thus their name).  Due to (1) the surgical skills of Dr.
<BR>
Kanshepolsky, retired neurosurgeon on Alcor's team, and (2) the need to
<BR>
produce a more efficient surgical route for the new vitirification
<BR>
procedures coming on line (we hope within months) for neuro patients, Alcor
<BR>
has pioneered a new surgical procedure that allows highly skilled surgeons
<BR>
to do a four-point cannulation (both carotids and both vertebrals) that
<BR>
promises (if the results of the cryoprotection seen with FM-2030 are any
<BR>
indication) to give far superior cryoprotection of the brain than we have
<BR>
been able to deliver before.
