<EM>&gt; &gt; If laymen can't understand that they will become obsolete, then it has
</EM><BR>
already
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accomplished more than they ever can.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you please rephrase this? If you mean that Super-AI would make human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual activities largely obsolete, then that may be a major source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of resistance to any such project.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; FWP

<P>&lt;rephrase mode&gt;
<BR>
AI/SI/TS will accomplish (&quot;in terms which laymen can understand&quot;) the
<BR>
obsolescence of lay persons, and in fact it has already made them obsolete due
<BR>
to their inability to understand the process.
<BR>
&lt;/rephrase mode&gt;
<BR>
<P>Lay persons will not become a major source of resistance to this project because
<BR>
lay persons, for the most part, don't believe that machines can become truly
<BR>
intelligent. (Ask the lay person on the street if you doubt this.)
<BR>
Lay persons generally scoff at the idea of Artificial Life. They won't believe
<BR>
it until they see it happen. By then, it will be too late to put the genie back
<BR>
in the bottle.
<BR>
I don't recommend that extropians try to persuade the general public that
<BR>
Artificial Life is probable in our lifetime, because as long as they don't
<BR>
believe it's possible, they won't interfere with the project. What they don't
<BR>
know can't hurt us.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I have traveled the length and breadth of this country and talked
<BR>
with the best people, and I can assure you that data processing is a
<BR>
fad that won't last out the year.&quot;
