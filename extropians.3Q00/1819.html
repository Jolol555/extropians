<P>I've investigated this and many of the links are broken.
<BR>
<P>What I have extracted from the pointers there is enough to convince
<BR>
me that the PC version is not the &quot;original&quot; Empire game.  It may
<BR>
be a knock-off or an alternately evolved variant.
<BR>
<P>For the record, the original versions of Empire were circulating around
<BR>
USENET from ~1976 to ~1981 and primarily ran on PDP-11 hardware (because
<BR>
Peter Langston primarily distributed binary versions to my knowledge).
<BR>
Versions running on different hardware, networked versions, or substantially
<BR>
after that time period are likely to be knock-offs or parallel path
<BR>
developments.
<BR>
<P>I would agree with documents that the original versions dated back
<BR>
to circa 1972-1975 at Reed College, though I do not beleive these
<BR>
were written in C, nor were they widely distributed.
<BR>
<P>Regarding making &quot;good&quot; games.  It is an interersting question as
<BR>
to what seduces people into games -- currently the paradigm would
<BR>
seem to suggest good graphics is a necessity -- in contrast the
<BR>
1970's games had *no* graphics -- you had to map the game entirely
<BR>
in your head.  I wonder if there are two types of people -- those
<BR>
who can create mental images reflecting a reality and those who
<BR>
require the images to be painted for them who would be enrolled
<BR>
into very different game presentations.
