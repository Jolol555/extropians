<P><EM>&gt;To carry a lethal weapon, as others have pointed out, means adjusting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your thought processes to the point where you are prepared to exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lethal force.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see the necessity of that relation.  One might be quite willing to 
<BR>
carry a lethal weapon and yet be quite unwilling to use it.  By far the 
<BR>
majority of defensive uses of firearms involve mere brandishing them.  It 
<BR>
suffices to give the impression that you can and will use deadly force.
<BR>
<P>Even were that claim true, I question the rhetorical implications of Hal's 
<BR>
questions about the psychological effects of preparing to wield deadly force 
<BR>
in defense of loved ones and self:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impersonal and hard-hearted? 
</EM><BR>
<P>To the contrary, I would argue that a person unwilling to conceive of using 
<BR>
deadly force in defense of self and loved ones lacks both self-regard and a 
<BR>
callous attitude toward the very people who most deserve protection.  Imagine 
<BR>
a father who says, &quot;Oh, my, no!  I would not shoot someone even if it were 
<BR>
the only way to stop them from raping my wife and killing my children!  That 
<BR>
would be so, so . . . cruel!&quot;  I think we would rightly regard that fellow as 
<BR>
not just a coward but as morally culpable for failing to shoulder his 
<BR>
responsibilities.  Would he nonetheless seem admirably warm-blooded, 
<BR>
personal, and soft-hearted to Hal?  If so, I aver that one can take such 
<BR>
traits, however virtuous in moderation, to unvirtuous extremes.
