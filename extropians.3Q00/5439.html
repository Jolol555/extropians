<P>&lt;&lt; A good smaller scale treatment of this is Barnes' _Kaleidoscope Century_, 
<BR>
where
<BR>
&nbsp;the KGB creates a singularity at the Earth/Sun L3 point (opposite the sun 
<BR>
from
<BR>
&nbsp;us) in 1980 or so, and a KGB agent has gone through thousands of CTC 
<BR>
iterations,
<BR>
&nbsp;tweaking the 21st century, and dragging along her sidekick, who is the main
<BR>
&nbsp;character, a rather memory befuddled individual. &gt;&gt;

Steve Barnes (is it Steve Barnes?) of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle fame is 
<BR>
a very good writer and very libertarian. An earlier work was written by 
<BR>
Engineer/SciFi-er James Hogan who postulated a Universe where the Great 
<BR>
Depression never occured, and therefore nazi germany never happended, thus 
<BR>
the Soviet Union finally collpased under Stalin's mass murders and 
<BR>
industrial-agricultural ineptness decades earlier then 1990. The thrust of 
<BR>
book is that some of the brains that would have become engineers or 
<BR>
physicists never perished on the Russian front or went up the smokestacks of 
<BR>
Aushwitz, so there was an enormous scientific leap forward, including 
<BR>
time-travel technology The baddies in the book, from the tiny National 
<BR>
Socialist Partei, and some badboy industrialists steal the Time McGuffin 
<BR>
and...you get the idea. I like Closed Timelike paths theory, because it fits 
<BR>
pretty much of what we see the universe behaving. However there is always the 
<BR>
other 90% of reality of what we cannot as yet detect.
