<P>Okay, although you did compare corporations to dictatorships.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All I'm trying to do is open a can of worms that I think needs to be opened.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starters, when I use the word corporation I'm referring to ones large enough to influence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public policy and legislation at both the state and federal level. Companies with a legion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of lawyers the size of small cities.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are other ways too that people organize into large, influential
<BR>
groups.  Political parties, of course, essentially own political power.
<BR>
Lobbying organizations press for legislation on all kinds of issues.
<BR>
Labor unions, environmental groups, single-issue interests, regional
<BR>
associations, small business organizations, the list goes on.
<BR>
<P>Do you feel equally concerned about these other ways people organize?
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that it is inevitable that when people come together with
<BR>
common goals, that they will gain disproportionate political influence.
<BR>
A mass of people, disorganized and pulling in all different directions
<BR>
at once, will be relatively less effective than an organized group.
<BR>
<P>The saving factor is that all these different groups, corporations,
<BR>
unions, political pressure groups of all kinds, each have different
<BR>
agendas.  And they are largely competing agendas.  Even within
<BR>
one of these categories there will be competition.  (See the
<BR>
recent Wired article on business organizations supporting Napster,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,38456,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,38456,00.html</A>.)  The result
<BR>
is something of a stalemate, a rough balance of power which tilts only
<BR>
slightly one way or the other and provides reasonable political stability.
