I know it's been tossed about before, but I'm wondering if the various computer geeky extros might like to put together a TH game? Between those with coding skills, artists, musicians, and game design talent (anders, that's you), we've got the right people. I know none of us has a lot of time, but together maybe we can make something. I'd be thinking an opensource project (via sourceforge). I'm sure I contacted someone here about doing a game some time ago, and never followed up (sorry). If there were a few of us, we'd all be comitted (to each other).
<BR>
<P>I'd be most interested in doing a massively multiplayer online game; might even be able to provide hosting. If there's enough groundswell, however, I'll back whatever everyone wants to do; I must be involved in writing a serious computer game at some point before I die (hopefully that's not soon, but hey).
<BR>
<P>Anyone maybe interested?
