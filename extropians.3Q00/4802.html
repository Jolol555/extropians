The 58th annual World Science Fiction Convention was held over the
<BR>
Labor Day weekend in Chicago.  During the convention the Hugo awards
<BR>
for best science fiction of the year are announced.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Vernor Vinge's A Deepness in the Sky, much discussed here, won
<BR>
for best science fiction novel of the year.  It beat the fascinating
<BR>
past-and-future crypto novel Cryptonomicon, one of the Harry Potter books,
<BR>
and Greg Bear's Darwin's Radio, which I've been reading but which I find
<BR>
completely unbelievable.
<BR>
<P>In best dramatic presentation, Galaxy Quest beat out The Matrix, The
<BR>
Sixth Sense, Being John Malkovich, and The Iron Giant.  IMO any of those
<BR>
were better than Galaxy Quest, with The Matrix being the clear winner.
<BR>
Probably GQ benefitted by being about sci-fi fans and conventions,
<BR>
which is after all where most of the votes come from.
<BR>
<P>Congratulations to Vernor Vinge.  Someone said he had quit his day job
<BR>
to write full time, good news for fans.  This award should help validate
<BR>
that decision.  I'm certainly looking forward to seeing his next work.
<BR>
<P>Hal
