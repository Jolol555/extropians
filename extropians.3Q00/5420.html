<EM>&gt; &gt; writes:  &lt;&lt; Okay, but you started off with this stuff about being created by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; God  who gave us rights. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Hal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     Given that we know the Washington, Jefferson and many others were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somewhat indifferent to organized religion was that phrasing literal or just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exhoratory?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My point was that we should respect the reasoning of Washington,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jefferson, etc. only if it makes sense to us.  Just because they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Great Men whom we were taught to worship in state-sponsored schools is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no reason to give special credence to what they say.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>We give credence to what they say because of the stature of their ideas
<BR>
and the type of country those ideas gave birth to.  The cynical view
<BR>
above is quite irrelevant.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Forrest began by writing, &quot;The reason for an armed populace is very,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very fundamental:&quot; and then he quoted the Declaration of Independence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which starts off by talking about God and how our rights come from him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That is really irrelevant.  The argument for any rights must come from a
<BR>
grounded argument for rights in general and  for what rights human
<BR>
beings have by virtue of being human beings, the type of creatures we
<BR>
are, in particular.  That the founders included God in their documents
<BR>
says more about the times they lived in than about the validity or
<BR>
invalidity of what they believed are fundamental human rights.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Why should we, who by and large reject theism, pay attention to a document
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has this as the foundation?  Whatever the authors thought about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God and organized religion, if they base their theory of natural rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the principle that we are endowed with them by our Creator with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capital C, they aren't going to convince me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Irrelevant.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Arguments from authority are always suspect.  Arguments from authorities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whom we are taught practically to worship are especially so.  And when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those authorities base their philosophies on positions which I find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abhorrent, the arguments are virtually useless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>If you do not bother to think about the underlying concepts and whether
<BR>
they can be reasonably validated without God premises then this is so. 
<BR>
But that would be quite unimaginative and intellectually lazy.
