<EM>&gt;A singularity which is &quot;slow&quot;; can someone explain this to me?
</EM><BR>
<P>It would help to know who the author was, but it might not matter because
<BR>
he/she explains it in the paragraph.  A Singularity may not happen like the
<BR>
metaphor of &quot;hitting the wall.&quot;  A coalescing the interplay could occur
<BR>
without much hyperbolic fanfare. Please refer to
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/vinge.htm">http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/vinge.htm</A>.  A slow, soft Singularity
<BR>
could be a situation in which the machine and human interface in such a
<BR>
cooperative and non-conflicting manner..  In this case, alarms would not go
<BR>
off, humans would not run to the hills, and the machine would not reach
<BR>
superintelligence so far ahead of humans that we are left it its dust.
