<EM>&gt; Another matter is the continued development of non-petroleum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based transportation fuels...

</EM><BR>
research on growing
<BR>
<EM>&gt;appropriately GM plants for fuel.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did a back of the envelope calculation on this question:
<BR>
Assuming no GM, what if we used all the land now under
<BR>
cultivation to grow corn, which is then distilled into
<BR>
alcohol to burn in our guzzlers?  How much would our
<BR>
oil consumption drop?
<BR>
<P>Corn yield/acre about 150 bushels / acre:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.financialexpress.com/fe/daily/19990823/fec23064.html">http://www.financialexpress.com/fe/daily/19990823/fec23064.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Ethanol yield about 2.5 gal / bushel:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.stinker.com/ethanol/corn.html">http://www.stinker.com/ethanol/corn.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Energy consumed in corn production &amp; ethanol production:
<BR>
Agriculture: 25%
<BR>
Production: 33%
<BR>
Total:           58%
<BR>
<P>So net yield is 42% of gross yield, so
<BR>
<P>Net yield 150 * 2.5 * .42 = 157 gal / acre
<BR>
<P>Total US Farm land in 1990 from Almanac: 988,000,000 acres
<BR>
<P>Ethanol 7.6E4 BTU / gal
<BR>
<P>Imagine all US farmland in corn, 1.6E2 * 9.9E8 * 7.6E4 = 1.2E16 BTU
<BR>
<P>Total US petroleum products consumption in 1989:  3.4E16 BTU.
<BR>
<P>So if all the proles now growing anything grew corn instead, and we
<BR>
distilled
<BR>
it and burned it in our detroits, we would displace about a third of
<BR>
the oil currently being used.
<BR>
<P>We use a loooootta energy.  Note, however that in 1960 there was
<BR>
more land under cultivation than today.  Furthermore, if one ever
<BR>
takes a flight across the U.S. one sees vast tracts of land, vaaaast
<BR>
tracts, simply lying fallow, going to waste!  Not being used to make
<BR>
fuel for my guzzler at all, but rather simply being infested by wild
<BR>
beasts and filthy vermin!  Utterly deplorable.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, if we all went with the new highly efficient hybrid fuel autos,
<BR>
<P>our demand would drop dramatically.  Furthermore, with appropriate
<BR>
GM, {both Genetic Modification and General Motors} totally renewable
<BR>
energy transportation is within our grasp.  spike
