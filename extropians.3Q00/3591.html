<P>
As we go into this Olympic season we are again reminded of the
<BR>
traditional nature of sports.  All the games have had the optimal
<BR>
strategies long since worked out, the athletes have honed all the
<BR>
same skills to within a hairs breadth of perfection, all the competitors
<BR>
<P>in each event look alike, all doing the same tricks, etc.
<BR>
<P>Booooorrrrringggggg.
<BR>
<P>What we need now are new sports, where the optimal strategy
<BR>
is still debatable.  Consider the Survivor game, which you have
<BR>
surely  heard about.  I didnt see any but the last half hour of the
<BR>
last show, but I understand there were three remaining players
<BR>
who participated in a challenge, the winner given the opportunity
<BR>
to vote off one of the others.  The last three included an unpopular
<BR>
man, a moderately popular woman and a very popular man.
<BR>
<P>There is a strange loop here, for the unpopular man must have
<BR>
realized that the only possible way he could win the prize is
<BR>
to lose the challenge!  Reasoning:  if he won the challenge, then
<BR>
he would face a vote by the last 7 contestants between himself
<BR>
and either the moderately popular woman or the highly popular
<BR>
man.  So, he lost the challenge, which was won by the woman,
<BR>
who acted in her own best interest in voting off the popular man
<BR>
(to whom she would have lost in the final election) but in so doing,
<BR>
she lost popularity with the jury of seven and so lost the final
<BR>
election to the unpopular man!
<BR>
<P>Now thats a cool strange-loop.
<BR>
<P>In the spirit of survivor, I propose a new sport, the optimal
<BR>
strategy of which is unclear.  The game is to see who can
<BR>
walk (or run) the greatest distance, assuming that the competitor
<BR>
must carry *all* necessary supplies, food, water, whatever else
<BR>
might be needed.
<BR>
<P>To make the competition end in a reasonable time, we would
<BR>
make the competition in Death Valley in the early fall, so its not
<BR>
so very hot, but is very dry.  This means most of the payload
<BR>
would be water.  Again to speed the competition, the walk
<BR>
ends if the competitor stops for more than 5 minutes.  All the
<BR>
competitors get a GPS receiver connected to a phone.  If
<BR>
that receiver gets the same number for 4.5 minutes, a warning
<BR>
tone sounds, and if it hasnt changed 30 seconds later, the
<BR>
pickup crew is called.  This of course would preclude sleeping,
<BR>
so the contest is unlikely to last more than about 30-40 hrs,
<BR>
the winners having traveled perhaps 150 km.
<BR>
<P>Under those conditions, men and women could compete
<BR>
equally, for it is unclear what advantage, if any, accrues to
<BR>
the biggest.  Also, there may be an advantage to the tall
<BR>
skinny people, for they would cover more real estate with
<BR>
each step, yet throw off access heat efficiently, thereby
<BR>
making the best use of their water and food.  For this
<BR>
reason, it may be clear why I like this game.
<BR>
<P>Has anyone ideas or suggestions?  spike
