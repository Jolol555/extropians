Hixon-Riggs Visiting Professor in Science,Technology, and Society
<BR>
at Harvey Mudd College
<BR>
<P>The Hixon Forum of Harvey Mudd College is pleased to announce a search
<BR>
for a Hixon-Riggs Visiting Professor. For 2001-2002 we seek an
<BR>
established scholar in almost any discipline who has a demonstrated
<BR>
interest in the social and cultural dimensions of computer science
<BR>
and/or information technology, broadly construed. Concerns might
<BR>
include, but need not be limited to, issues of internet access, privacy,
<BR>
and/or security; social and economic issues associated with e-commerce;
<BR>
changing notions of intellectual property; general problems of balancing
<BR>
public and commercial interests in internet development and regulation;
<BR>
the promise and practice of net based education; or the possible
<BR>
psychological or social consequences of changing patterns of computer or
<BR>
internet use. The Hixon-Riggs Visiting Professor will be expected to
<BR>
teach in his/her special area of expertise, to play a mentorship role in
<BR>
the College's Hixon Forum for Responsive Technology, give public
<BR>
lectures or presentations, and organize a conference or program on a
<BR>
topic of current interest. The appointment is for either a semester or a
<BR>
full academic year, and its terms are negotiable. The Professorship
<BR>
resides in the Department of Humanities and Social
<BR>
Sciences.
<BR>
<P>Harvey Mudd College, a highly selective member of the Claremont
<BR>
Colleges, is one of the nation's premier undergraduate institutions
<BR>
specializing in science, mathematics, and engineering; and the Hixon
<BR>
Forum is closely associated with the STS Program of the Claremont
<BR>
Colleges. Harvey Mudd College is actively concerned with fostering
<BR>
diversity in its faculty, staff, and student body, and welcomes
<BR>
applications from women and underrepresented minorities.
<BR>
<P>Please address inquiries or nominations to Professor Richard Olson, The
<BR>
Hixon Forum, Harvey Mudd College, 301 East 12th Street, Claremont, CA
<BR>
91711 (or to <A HREF="mailto:olson@hmc.edu?Subject=Re:%20[Fwd:%20Job%20Listing%20-%20Harvey%20Mudd%20College]&In-Reply-To=&lt;39C95D81.4812@erols.com&gt;">olson@hmc.edu</A>). Since we are creating a long-term list of
