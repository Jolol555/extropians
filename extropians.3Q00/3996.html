<P>Dear Health Freedom Activist:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Members of The Life Extension Foundation received great news this Summer
<BR>
when they learned that both the House and Senate overwhelmingly passed
<BR>
legislation that legalizes the importation of drugs made in FDA-approved
<BR>
facilities in the US and abroad. President Clinton has said he will sign
<BR>
this legislation.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This drug importation legislation is included as part of the Agriculture
<BR>
Appropriations bill. If this final bill is signed into law, it will
<BR>
greatly reduce the cost of prescription medications to the consumer. The
<BR>
drug industry, on the other hand, is battling tooth and nail to convince
<BR>
Congress to drop the drug importation provision from the Agriculture
<BR>
Appropriations bill. The drug companies, of course, want to protect their
<BR>
illicit monopoly of the American marketplace.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
We are therefore asking those who cherish free choice to call their U.S.
<BR>
Representative and request that he/she sign a letter to the Agriculture
<BR>
Appropriations Conferees that is now being circulated by Congressman Gil
<BR>
Gutknecht. This particular letter (attached below) urges the Conferees to
<BR>
keep the drug importation provision in the final version of the
<BR>
Agriculture Appropriations bill.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
If you don't know the name of your Representative, please call the House
<BR>
switchboard at 1-202-224-3121 or access the House's Web site at
<BR>
(www.house.gov)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Please join the growing army of educated consumers that have discovered
<BR>
identical medications can be obtained from other countries at much lower
<BR>
prices. 
<BR>
<P>By asking your Congressional representative to sign on to the letter being
<BR>
circulated by Congressman Gil Gutknecht, you will help beat back drug
<BR>
industry lobbyists who are seeking to ensure that Americans keep paying
<BR>
the highest prices in the world for their prescription medications. 
<BR>
<P>Attached below is the letter by Congressmen Gil Gutknecht that you should
<BR>
ask your member of Congress to sign on to. You can ask your member of
<BR>
Congress to call Gil Gutkneck's office at 202-225-2472 to sign on to this
<BR>
letter.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For longer life,
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Faloon
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>(What follows is Congressman Gutknecht's letter that you will be asking
<BR>
your Congressmen to sign on to.)
<BR>
<P>Dear Agriculture Appropriations Conferees:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Based on the clear will of Congress demonstrated in overwhelming votes in
<BR>
both Houses during the past month, we are writing to underscore for you
<BR>
the crucial importance of including a strong provision legalizing
<BR>
importation of prescription drugs made in FDA-approved facilities in the
<BR>
Conference Report to the Agriculture Appropriations bill.  
<BR>
<P>As you know, drug importation votes in the House and Senate have made
<BR>
clear Congress' conviction that the world's best consumers should not be
<BR>
paying the world's highest prices. On June 29, the House passed
<BR>
legislation strengthening importers' due-process rights. 
<BR>
<P>Earlier this month, the House passed two measures, one offered by
<BR>
Representative Crowley, the other by Representative Coburn, effectively
<BR>
repealing a 1988 law against importing FDA-approved drugs originally made
<BR>
in the United States.  
<BR>
<P>The Senate also has made its will clear. On July 19, the Senate passed
<BR>
legislation by a vote of 74-21 reiterating the House position that the
<BR>
1988 re-importation ban should be overturned. In addition to explicitly
<BR>
legalizing the importation of drugs made in FDA-approved facilities, the
<BR>
Senate measure instructed the FDA to establish regulations to ensure the
<BR>
safety of such imports. 
<BR>
<P>In the light of these clear and definitive steps by both the House of
<BR>
Representatives and the Senate, we urge the Conferees to include
<BR>
legislation in the Conference Report to the Agriculture Appropriations
<BR>
bill repealing the 1988 re-importation ban and establishing the legality
<BR>
of importation of prescription drugs made in FDA-approved facilities in
<BR>
the United States and abroad.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
(Your Representative in the House)
