<P><EM>&gt;Yes, that makes sense; organizing in a group amplifies your power, for good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or evil.  However corporations and other groups are not inherently evil or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrong, any more than are other power amplification systems like science and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A lot of evil contributed to big corporations seem to consist of &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situations where two parties voluntarily cooporate on some effort, but &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because one of the parties is in a significantly weaker bargaining &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position (because of market conditions, lack of information, or &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatever), most of the benefit deriving from the effort goes to the
</EM><BR>
other
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; party (i.e. shareholders of the corporation). Is it evil to take &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;IMO it is not evil to engage in interactions which are voluntary for all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parties.  As I understand these situations, the &quot;victim&quot; actually has his 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;situation improved, but just not as much as the victimizer. However I know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that many people have a different intuition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely!  The bottom line is that a corporation, because it is bigger
<BR>
has
<BR>
the power of both money and armies of lawyers to screw everyone else.  Sure
<BR>
many companies are not malign.  But what about all the ones that are?  The
<BR>
problem that you continue to overlook is that the malign companies are
<BR>
often
<BR>
able to get away with their 'evil' acts because they have power to pay or
<BR>
legalize the problem away, as is now with the DMCA.
<BR>
<P>Here is my point - in an idealistic legal system you have an arbitrary case
<BR>
of
<BR>
Person X vs. Corp X where justice prevails every time.  But instead the
<BR>
legal
<BR>
system almost always favors the corporation, because they have more people,
<BR>
more money, and more lawyers.  That means that in any legal case, the
<BR>
probability of victory always sides with the one with the most money.
<BR>
<P>To reiterate what I said earlier - the biggest bug in our so-called
<BR>
free-market
<BR>
is that everything is up for grabs (freedom, justice), where he with the
<BR>
most
<BR>
money wins.

<BR>
<P><P>The whole point of having a legal system - whether via state fiat or some
<BR>
other means, such as a social contract - is to reduce as far as possible the
<BR>
ability of those with power or money to capitalize on it to steal from those
<BR>
less wealthy or powerful.  That's why we support legal systems.  That's
<BR>
their purpose.  &quot;A government of laws, not men.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The genius of the West, as one of the many offshoots of the concept of
<BR>
objectivity which European culture originated and refined, was to remove the
<BR>
influence of power from the adjudication of property disputes, via
<BR>
mechanisms such as the jury trial, the common law, the Unified Commercial
<BR>
Code, and the concept of a contract itself, as something that could be
<BR>
enforced.
<BR>
<P>Other cultures, such as the Chinese, have not come up through that long
<BR>
philosophical evolution, do not accept as part of their root Weltanshauung
<BR>
the concept of objectivity itself, certainly do not accept it in the Western
<BR>
sense of applying to social/ethical relationships, and thus have little
<BR>
inherent respect, in the Western sense, for such things as contracts.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, one of the essential flaws of the monopoly state is that it
<BR>
can and is always bought.  It is always at the service of the more
<BR>
concentrated, powerful interests, against the interests of truly objective
<BR>
justice.  The faster we can move the actual practice of justice away from
<BR>
state control, the better.  Peace follows from justice.  Where there is no
<BR>
justice, there can be no peace, but only war.  Witness Chinese history.
