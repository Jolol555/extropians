<EM>&gt;  &gt; CYMM SAYS: Eugene it won't work. Betcha writing hyperintelligent AI is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; addictive than heroin. If you can't stop people from writing klutzy computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; viruses - how are you going to stop them from writing AI?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can't stop them completely, but you can impose severe penalties,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; establishing deterrence, and create some infrastructure allowing you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to detect and truncate worms in an early stage. Simple traffic pattern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; analysis will already help a lot. You'll see a node hitting other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nodes with perversion packets (some of this will consist of varying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; traffic, trying to find a new hole), and some of those hit with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packet repeat same behaviour after a time. After it has found a good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solution, the system will use the same packet for the same system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; type, so you could in principle filter it in realtime. You'll have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segment the Net, and use sanity checks, and remote
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (crypto-authenticated) restore to sane state, and the like. Of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the worm will adapt to countermeasures, but at least you will make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less easy.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is simply all too easy to find a tiny door into a system and set up a
<BR>
tiny sleeper that awakens on some signal and reads instructions as to
<BR>
what to do somewhere else (like encoded in other data files already on
<BR>
the system and seemingly innocent).  Every system cracking work of any
<BR>
seriousness I have ever seen says it is literally impossible to 100%
<BR>
secure a system short of having it unplugged from the net entirely.  And
<BR>
even that may not be enough.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By reducing nucleation frequency and reducing the amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computational resources available you can obviously reduce the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; risk. Whether it will be enough in end, who knows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; And ...AI doesn't have to be very smart to be ultra destructive. The human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; authour just has to be a psychopath, is all.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In fact, a dumb yet truly mutable worm can sustainably shut down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; net essentially for good. As long as there's a single infected node,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reinfection is assured. The only way to combat this is 100% correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software (obviously impossible) or adaptively evolving immune system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software, which will be based on the same principle which has enabled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the worm, eventually ascertaining an equilibrium.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yep, you've got it. Basic evolutionary warfare scenario. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  &gt; CYMM SAYS: If he were a physical &amp; sovereign state, maybe. But such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I would literally nuke individual facilities, if a convincing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; threat is present. I'd say that should be a standard operating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; procedure in responses to Armageddon class threats. Colour me Vinge's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Peacer, I guess.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is one reason your little finger is not on the red button.  Your
<BR>
solution is gross, dangerous in the extreme to innocents and will really
<BR>
piss of any surviving relatives and progenitors of the nuked system[s]. 
<BR>
Not smart.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; strategy hasn't been deployed with the drug production of Andean South
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; America... and I daresay it never will. Far less for, say, 20,000 or so 21
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; year olds scattered through university dorms and living rooms the world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Did you knew that they've started outlawing free Unices in selected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; college dorms?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Really?  It is definitely time for the Church of the Hallowed Byte. 
<BR>
Time for revolution.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not. I don't like where the logics of it all is leading us. There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must be a more constructive way out.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure.  Start the Church of the Hallowed Byte or the equivalent and
<BR>
develop both a high tech centered movement that pulls in a lot of
<BR>
futuristic developers and open source people, futurist and so on and
<BR>
insists all information be open and that develops a strong morality for
<BR>
how to use this technological base in service of humankind.  Not
<BR>
fullproof but more positive than simply nuking folks who disagree with
<BR>
you.  :-)
