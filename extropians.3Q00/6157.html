Ron, its not a matter, I believe, of describing the nazis as capitalist. 
<BR>
Their economic systems were just like Mussolini's fascism. But I feel I need 
<BR>
to at least give history its due, and understand that many people who were of 
<BR>
capitalist bent, did business with the nazis, and were enthusiastic 
<BR>
supporters, and suppliers to the nazi movement; its policies, its 
<BR>
infrastructure, and so forth. Very few of the small shopkeepers, and 
<BR>
industrial barrons, contributed to this system, purely out of fear.

<P>&lt;&lt; No, my understanding of the practices in Nazi Germany were not the result 
<BR>
&nbsp;of business transactions but the practices of a National Socialist 
<BR>
&nbsp;Government.  Soldiers and policemen rounded up those prisoners, placed them 
<BR>
&nbsp;in custody and either killed outright or worked them to death.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Adam Smith, I am not aware that he ever described slavery as a 
<BR>
&nbsp;capitalist process.  However I think it is very unfair to have anyone define 
<BR>
&nbsp;capitalism other than its advocates.  Otherwise we end in a situation like 
<BR>
&nbsp;the one today where you are defining the practices of Nazi Germany as 
<BR>
&nbsp;Capitalism when in fact none of the advocates of Capitalism has ever 
<BR>
promoted 
<BR>
&nbsp;any such conduct.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only people running Nazi Germany were people describing themselves 
<BR>
as 
<BR>
&nbsp;socialist.
