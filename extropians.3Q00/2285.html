<EM>&gt; Robin's paper (<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf</A>&gt;  or .ps) presents an adaptation of his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Idea Futures proposal to government. The basic idea is that a proposed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policy should become law if it increases expected welfare, where the welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; measure is determined by democratic vote, and expected effect on welfare is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determined by the trading value of claims on what the welfare will be given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the proposed policy is accepted. I think the idea is very interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and definitely worth exploring further.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One point that I would be interested in seeing discussed in the paper is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether this system of decision-making is often used in corporations, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it isn't, what is the reason?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am still catching up on my reading after returning from vacation,
<BR>
and haven't read Robin's latest version of this paper, which I hope to
<BR>
do soon.  BTW since it hasn't been mentioned here lately, Marc Stiegler's
<BR>
novel EarthWeb describes how Idea Futures (IF) can be used to manage
<BR>
every step of a hazardous space exploration.  Literally, an IF market
<BR>
is used to decide whether to turn one way or the other at intersections.
<BR>
I didn't think this was very plausible but it does represent an extreme
<BR>
case of how IF might come to permeate society.
<BR>
<P>I think there would be difficulties in using IF in corporations as you
<BR>
suggest.  As you say, Robin's idea has two parts: set up a measure you
<BR>
want to optimize, and then use IF to evaluate which strategies would
<BR>
lead to the best outcome in terms of this measure.
<BR>
<P>For a corporation, the natural measure to maximize would be corporate
<BR>
profits.  Then the question becomes, which strategies will best maximize
<BR>
profits?  Theoretically, IF can answer that question.  However, there are
<BR>
many problems, some of which might apply to the government case as well.
<BR>
<P>First, the number of possible strategies is nearly infinite.  This is a
<BR>
common problem in AI/robotics work as well.  For a robot to accomplish
<BR>
a goal, it has a virtually infinite number of possible combinations of
<BR>
actions to take.  Somehow the possibilities have to be pruned down to a
<BR>
manageable number before beginning the detailed analysis of which is best.
<BR>
This pruning process may be vulnerable to error that would impair the
<BR>
usefulness of the IF projections.
<BR>
<P>This problem applies to government, and it may be addressed in Robin's
<BR>
paper.  However the problem is worse in the case of corporations, because
<BR>
there are far more of them than governments.  You'd need IF claims on
<BR>
every possible strategy for every possible corporation.  The market
<BR>
would be spread so thinly that the number of interested investors per
<BR>
claim could be too low to provide meaningful information.
<BR>
<P>Another problem is the exposure this would provide of potentially secret
<BR>
corporate strategies.  Secrecy is an important tool in the product
<BR>
development cycle.  A corporation which had to run its best ideas
<BR>
through a public IF market to see which ones are worth pursuing must
<BR>
give up secrecy.  This would not be so much of an issue for government
<BR>
programs, with the exception of military research.
<BR>
<P>I would also be concerned that efforts to manipulate prices (and therefore
<BR>
predictions) could succeed in places.  Corporate competitors could work
<BR>
to drive the corporation into unproductive strategies.  They have deep
<BR>
pockets and focussed interests, so they may be able to move prices
<BR>
significantly, out of proportion to their size.  This is a general
<BR>
problem with IF and I know that Robin predicts that it will not happen,
<BR>
but I am not confident.  It seems to me that even in today's investment
<BR>
markets, which are among the most liquid and heavily traded that have ever
<BR>
existed, there have been many successful cases of price manipulation,
<BR>
at least for a limited time.  If IF became a more widely used mechanism
<BR>
for social organization, liquidity per market would be diluted, making
<BR>
manipulation even more practical.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it the case that nobody has thought of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doing things this way before (which would be surprising, given that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are so many companies around involved in fierce competition, and a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people trying to think of better forms of management)? Are there legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prohibitions, and are they then strong enough that no company would find it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worthwhile lobbying to get rid of them? And is that the case in every market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economy in the world?
</EM><BR>
<P>The obvious practical problem is that no IF market exists!
<BR>
If corporations were going to piggyback on an existing IF market to
<BR>
evaluate future strategies, they couldn't do so until there was such
<BR>
a market.
<BR>
<P>As far as the question of starting a market, the legal issues are
<BR>
complicated due to the many possible jurisdictions involved.  In some
<BR>
ways it is a form of gambling, but in others it is more like a commodities
<BR>
market and plays a similarly useful role.  In most places both activities
<BR>
are heavily regulated, so you'd probably need special legal authorizations
<BR>
for a large scale IF market to operate.
