<P>True, but you can get 20% panels, too, and more, if price is

irrelevant (~32% is about the best we can get iirc with multilayer

<BR>
The insolation figure is totally ad hoc, since I don't have access to
<BR>
my library, and a websearch via dialup in Krautland is a bear. I just
<BR>
thought that 0.5 kW/m^2 on the average over a 10 h period in
<BR>
California-type area is the about the right ballpark figure, if the
<BR>
solar flux constant is 1.3 kW/m^2. I would of course welcome seeing

real numbers.

</EM><BR>
<P>I did not know the average number of cloudy days in California, and
<BR>
just took 365, assuming the few 10 days would not make a difference,
<BR>
as other parameters have been chosen rather conservatively, and this
<BR>
is a back of the envelope estimate.

<P>Nitpicker!
