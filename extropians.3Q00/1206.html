<P>
I had an interesting flash this evening that yielded a metaphor for
<BR>
what some issues surrounding reanimation might be like.
<BR>
This is not an attack on cryonics, it's my exploration of what might
<BR>
happen to *me.*  I don't think this is entirely original (save the
<BR>
Egyptology angle), but I've not heard this perspective aired in a
<BR>
while.  I started thinking about how I would feel about being stored
<BR>
in the back room of a museum.
<BR>
<P>This is a metaphor;  please don't attack the obvious lack of
<BR>
feasibility.   
<BR>
<P>What if, I ask, we could today reanimate a pharoah?   After unwinding
<BR>
the mummy wrappings, immersing the remains insome secret sauce, and
<BR>
achieving regeneration, we could, with contemporary medical
<BR>
technology repair most causes of death, and offer significant life
<BR>
expectancy extension compared to the person's original expectations. 
<BR>
And, heck, we can offer eventual suspension for yet another afterlife.
<BR>
<P>Would we do this?  Should we?
<BR>
<P>I come up with the following issues:
<BR>
<P>a) We can't meet the pharoah's expectations.  This isn't the Egyptian
<BR>
afterlife.  Y2K is not going to be a fun place for anyone who was
<BR>
suspended back then.   There is no environment for them to be
<BR>
comfortable in, and it's probably infeasible to create one that is
<BR>
more than trivially large (we could clearly decorate an apartment
<BR>
appropriately).  Contrary to this, I imagine that an engineer of the
<BR>
time (Imhotep) would be extremely interested in skyscrapers and
<BR>
telescopes.
<BR>
<P>b) We can't really communicate with our time-traveller very well. 
<BR>
Actually, we do know a great deal about what the language sounded
<BR>
like.  I was thinking we'd have to hope that the ancient suspendee
<BR>
was literate, but I wasn't recalling the good state of understanding
<BR>
of the language.   Actually this &quot;can't communicate&quot; issue was to be
<BR>
key, and I've torpedoed it.   Culturally there is going to be a huge
<BR>
gap.  I don't know how to compare it to existing cases of isolated
<BR>
tribes, though.   Getting more connected to my Egyptology side, I
<BR>
KNOW there'd be a long line of people wanting to ask a lot of
<BR>
questions.
<BR>
<P>Well.  What I meant to write about was a model suggesting that
<BR>
suspendees might be left suspended indefinitely (forever) because of
<BR>
irrelevance (too ancient/different to be interesting) and
<BR>
acculturation (too unfair to wake them into the modern world).  Like
<BR>
mummies in a museum.   
<BR>
<P>My expectation is that the oncoming singularity compresses history
<BR>
such that the changes from Kufu's time (2,500 BCE) to ours may
<BR>
actually look small compared to what our modern suspendees will face.
<BR>
I'm not presently able to imagine how improved technologies will
<BR>
address this.   The suspendees may uploaded instead of physically
<BR>
reanimaged. then modified (note that this essentially has to be
<BR>
without fully informed consent) so as to be able to function in the
<BR>
social world of the future.
<BR>
<P>Strange stuff.  It wouldn't be a singularity if we could see the
<BR>
other side.
