<P>The debate in this article, &quot;Intelligence in the Cosmos: Flesh or
<BR>
Machine?&quot; seems misguided.  The distinction between machine and biology
<BR>
will not necessarily remain meaningful in the future.  Biology can be
<BR>
engineered and improved until it would be unrecognizable to a biologist
<BR>
today.
<BR>
<P>When we meet an alien which is a product of a mature technology, his
<BR>
physical form will be entirely due to choice, to the constraints imposed
<BR>
by natural law and by his own desires.  Asking whether this form is
<BR>
biological or mechanical is meaningless.
<BR>
<P>I was also disappointed, as I often am, by the primitive thinking
<BR>
exhibited by people who are supposedly experts in the field.  Benjamin
<BR>
Zuckerman, a UCLA professor who edited a book on ETI, pronounces himself
<BR>
surprised by the notion that aliens could be monitoring us invisibly
<BR>
via nanotech.  Come on, we've talked about that notion dozens of times
<BR>
over the years.  It's so obvious that anyone with a basic awareness of
<BR>
the issues will think of it!  And yet this Zuckerman sticks with his Star
<BR>
Trek view of the universe.  Our debates on these issues are apparently
<BR>
far more advanced and sophisticated than what passes for discourse in
<BR>
the old-style academic world.
