<P><EM>&gt; Anyway, my main point is this: Even if it is an existant right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent others from copying certain pieces of information, there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing that you can do to stop it, and the situation will become even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more hopeless for you as encryption and &quot;ripping&quot; technologies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various sorts improve.  You might regard these developments as bad; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't.  But they are unstoppable.
</EM><BR>
<P>Your argument is essentially that since we can't stop everyone from doing
<BR>
it, we shouldn't even try.  Clearly then we should stop prosecuting
<BR>
murderers as well, since it's obvious that murders continue, despite our
<BR>
efforts to prevent them.  Fortunately, despite the fact that absolute
<BR>
security may be impossible, we are sufficiently flexible to understand that
<BR>
it is more desirable to strive towards security than to reliquish all
<BR>
attempts to control the situation.
<BR>
<P>I find this &quot;it's impossible, don't bother&quot; mentality to be bothersome in
<BR>
the general population, but even more so amongst supposed transhumans-- In
<BR>
some ways I feel that we ought to determine what is -desirable- and then
<BR>
move towards making it happen.  Every generation is filled with the
<BR>
nay-sayers who say such and such is impossible, despite the seemingly
<BR>
endless historical evidence of progession.
<BR>
<P>In fact, I would love to call a moratorium on the &quot;it's impossible, don't
<BR>
bother,&quot; argument-- why not try arguing the case of the basis of whether it
<BR>
is desirable and leave your inability to imagine innovative solutions at the
<BR>
door.
<BR>
<P>There are numerous examples of humans imposing arbitrary order upon a system
<BR>
in order to exert a desirable influence over it.  In my opinion, government
<BR>
is simply a form of social technology, and a powerful tool in our arsenal.

<P><P><P><EM>&gt; It's not irrational to enforce one's alleged right.  It's irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to TRY to do so if enforcement is impossible.  (Lucky for us, it's a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot easier to enforce one's right to live than it is to enforce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; copyright.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Those damn irrational Wright brothers.  Didn't they know that it had been
<BR>
scientifically proven that heavier than air flight was impossible?
