<EM>&gt; &gt;Ralph, didnt students fight when you were in high school?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NO -- NEVER, I can't remember a fight ever happening in grade or high school.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And this was when the movie &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;s was made (so everyone can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guess my age now). Some &quot;hoods&quot; did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carry switchblades but it was more of a fashion statement. Most of the &quot;hoods&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were really nice guys if you actually got to know them as I did in shop class.
</EM><BR>
<P>Amazing.  In 1974-75 I attended junior high in New York City, a &quot;decent&quot;
<BR>
neighborhood in Bayside, Queens.  Brawling was something I became
<BR>
proficient at, whether I wanted to or not- I was a short fat kid with
<BR>
glasses, an out of town accent, and a straight-A average... in short, a
<BR>
pariah.  I learned to fight dirty, strangling, poking eyes, kneeing
<BR>
groins, and how to use a club and quarterstaff and broken bottle
<BR>
(thankfully I only had to bluff with the bottle).
<BR>
<P>I never got into more than five fights in one day, though, and managed
<BR>
to qualify to enter the Bronx High School of Science.  My family left
<BR>
New York before then, to return to the relative peace of Colorado- where
<BR>
the fighting was far less, but not absent.
<BR>
<P>When were you in school, Ralph?  Somehow I doubt if things have changed
<BR>
nationally, you may have been in a remarkably peaceful place.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I dont know.  When did all this civil behavior come to life?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I never saw much that resembled civil behavior until I went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to college.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps when we let it die and we stoped telling pepple &quot;that's not cool&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or when we passed so many laws that everyone thought let the law and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; police take care of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps so- and I like to think that my experience was the exception,
<BR>
rather than the norm.
