All these animals, pets asside, are measured in a natural environment, w/o 
<BR>
medicine ect, how long is the average &quot;wild&quot; human lifespan in similar 
<BR>
situation... 30 years?

<P>The vast majority of species put their resources into having a large number
<BR>
of offspring. A small number of species, such as humans, have only a few
<BR>
offspring but considerable  resources  are used to ensure that  they 
<BR>
actually
<BR>
make it into adulthood. In both strategies enormous energies are put into
<BR>
reproduction and that's a much better investment from evolution's point of
<BR>
view than immortality.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;It  needs to show exactly why different critters sharing the same 
</EM><BR>
indices
<BR>
<EM>     &gt;can  vary in lifespan by huge ratios - 1:10, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>I once saw a plot of average body weight Vs average life expectancy of 
<BR>
several
<BR>
hundred species, with one glaring exception it fit a straight line pretty 
<BR>
well,
<BR>
usually the larger the species the longer it lived. Humans however were 
<BR>
completely
<BR>
off the chart, they lived 4 or 5 times as long as you'd expect given their 
<BR>
size.
<BR>
I've also heard that most mammals have about an equal number of heartbeats
<BR>
during their lifetime because small hearts beat faster, but human hearts 
<BR>
beat many
<BR>
more times than any other animal. Evolution probably let us live longer 
<BR>
because our
<BR>
children are helpless for such a long time.  And that probably happens 
<BR>
because
<BR>
it takes a long time to learn how to use that big brain effectively, for 
<BR>
that matter it
<BR>
takes a long time to even get a big brain, due to the small size of the 
<BR>
birth canal,
<BR>
caused by bipedalism, the brain has a lot of growing to do after birth.
