J.R. Molloy forwards:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Here's the background, per the Associated Press: In a segment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; questioning the health benefits of organic foods, first aired in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; February and then repeated in July, Stossel reported that a test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; conducted on vegetable produce for ABC News found that there was no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; pesticide residue on either conventionally-grown samples or organic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; ones. But after an investigation, ABC concluded that no such test had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; been done.  ABC has stated that Stossel was relying on inaccurate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; information that had been provided by a staff member.  The segment's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; producer apparently mistakenly believed that a test done on chicken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; had also been done on vegetables.  The producer has reportedly been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; suspended for thirty days and Stossel himself will make an on-air
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; apology on Friday. (Hence the rescheduling of his documentary &quot;Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; America Number One?&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<P>This is tonight, BTW.  Should be interesting to see how much Stossel is
<BR>
forced to retract.  The organic food people are also claiming that Stossel
<BR>
said that organic chicken was contaminated with E. Coli, without checking
<BR>
to see if it was a harmful strain or one of the many harmless ones.
<BR>
<P>Stossel got in trouble a few weeks ago with Erin Brokovich, the real
<BR>
person behind the movie based on her story.  She had famously pushed
<BR>
forward a legal case about contaminated water that eventually led to
<BR>
a large settlement.  Stossel claimed that the contaminant was actually
<BR>
not known to cause cancer when ingested in water, and furthermore that
<BR>
statistically the incidence of cancer among local residents was no higher
<BR>
than average.  Brokovich came back with an invitation to Stossel to have
<BR>
his family drink similarly contaminated water.  He declined but said,
<BR>
let's not scare people unnecessarily.
<BR>
<P>Personally I don't feel a knee-jerk impulse to defend this guy just
<BR>
because he may share some of my political views.  IMO he should be very
<BR>
careful about making claims, especially when they contradict expectations.
<BR>
If you're saying that grocery store produce has no pesticide residues,
<BR>
you ought to make sure of your facts.  Anyone who rinses an apple before
<BR>
eating is going to be skeptical about this.  By going out with false
<BR>
information, he damages his own cause, which means he damages my causes.
<BR>
<P>Next time John Stossel says that GM food is safe, or that people can
<BR>
use drugs responsibly, or that gun control raises crime rates, people
<BR>
are going to wonder: is this another pesticide coverup?  Can Stossel
<BR>
really be trusted?  Everything he says is going to be questioned.
<BR>
<P>I don't think ABC will fire him; the controversy will be good for ratings.
<BR>
I'll probably watch 20/20 tonight even though I detest the weepy stories
<BR>
they often present.  But even if a bunch of libertarians descend on the
<BR>
message boards to rally round the cause, it's not going to help Stossel's
<BR>
credibility in the long run.
<BR>
