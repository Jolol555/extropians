<P>I am against all war, including the US involvement in the Kosovo War.  That
<BR>
one was kinda tricky because the notion was that by intervening, more lives
<BR>
were saved than were lost.  I sure hope that is true, however I would prefer
<BR>
to see peace achieved by having all countries owning outrageously advanced
<BR>
defense technologies, that make them too expensive to attack.  In the long
<BR>
run machines are very cheap compared to war.  I am interested in seeing
<BR>
the development of weapons that can *only* be used to defend, but are
<BR>
useless for attack.  Such things exist.
<BR>
<P>Another reason that war was difficult was that it was an internal conflict.
<BR>
Even libertarians have a hard time seeing what is the right thing to do there.
<BR>
Im open to suggestion.  spike
