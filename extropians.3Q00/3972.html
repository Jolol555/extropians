I wonder why you are concerned with Deiicide(sp) and how it relates to modern 
<BR>
life? If the concept of God is gone from humanity, do you expect that the 
<BR>
people who believe will not take up some other nonsense? Will you be safer 
<BR>
from the missionaries, will sociry be more sensible and humane? Are you 
<BR>
rebelling against Jesus, Jerry Fallwell, the Buddha, Pagans, whom? All? Just 
<BR>
curious. Because I wonder where the payoff is?

<P>&lt;&lt; To me, the essence of Nietzsche is that he was a destroyer
<BR>
&nbsp;of the boxes within which people are intelligent.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;In his attempt to destroy religious boxes, he said &quot;God is dead!&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;and got his message onto the cover of Time magazine.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Many religious people are highly intelligent... within their
<BR>
&nbsp;religious boxes.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Max Stirner ('The Ego and its Own') was, in my opinion, a
<BR>
&nbsp;more penetrating box-destroyer than Nietzsche. He essentially
<BR>
&nbsp;said, &quot;You need to go beyond killing God, you need to destroy
<BR>
&nbsp;the very notion of &quot;god&quot; (so-called), the very idea of &quot;god&quot;; the
<BR>
&nbsp;word &quot;god&quot; needs to become no more than a nonsense-noise
<BR>
&nbsp;to you.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Nietzsche also attempted to destroy political boxes:
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;There are still peoples and herds somewhere, but not with us,
<BR>
&nbsp;my brothers: here there are states.
<BR>
&nbsp;The state? What is that? Well then! Now open your ears, for
<BR>
&nbsp;now I shall speak to you of the death of peoples.
<BR>
&nbsp;The state is the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly it lies, too;
<BR>
&nbsp;and this lie creeps from its mouth; 'I, the state, am the people.'
<BR>
&nbsp;It is a lie! It was creators who created peoples and hung a faith
<BR>
&nbsp;and a love over them: thus they served life.
<BR>
&nbsp;It is destroyers who set snares for many and call it the state:
<BR>
&nbsp;they hang a sword and a hundred desires over them.
<BR>
&nbsp;Where a people still exists, there the people do not understand
<BR>
&nbsp;the state and hate it as the evil eye and sin against custom and
<BR>
&nbsp;law.
<BR>
&nbsp;I offer you this sign: every people speaks its own language of
<BR>
&nbsp;good and evil: its neighbor does not understand this language.
<BR>
&nbsp;It invented this language for itself in custom and law.
<BR>
&nbsp;But the state lies in all languages of good and evil; and whatever
<BR>
&nbsp;it says, it lies -- and whatever it has, it has stolen.
<BR>
&nbsp;Everything about it is false; it bites with stolen teeth. Even its
<BR>
&nbsp;belly is false.
<BR>
&nbsp;Confusion of the language of good and evil; I offer you this sign
<BR>
&nbsp;of the state. Truly, this sign indicates the will to death! Truly,
<BR>
&nbsp;it beckons to the preachers of death!
<BR>
&nbsp;Many too many are born: the state was invented for the
<BR>
&nbsp;superfluous!
<BR>
&nbsp;Just see how it lures them, the many-too-many! How it devours
<BR>
&nbsp;them, and chews them, and re-chews them!
<BR>
&nbsp;...It would like to range heroes and honorable men about it, this
<BR>
&nbsp;new idol! It likes to sun itself in the sunshine of good consciences
<BR>
&nbsp;-- this cold monster!
<BR>
&nbsp;It will give you everything if you worship it, this new idol: thus it
<BR>
&nbsp;buys for itself the luster of your virtues and the glance of your
<BR>
&nbsp;proud eyes.
<BR>
&nbsp;It wants to use you to lure the many-too-many. Yes, a cunning
<BR>
&nbsp;device of Hell has here been devised, a horse of death jingling
<BR>
&nbsp;with the trappings of divine honors!
<BR>
&nbsp;Yes, a death for many has here been devised that glorifies itself
<BR>
&nbsp;as life: truly a heart-felt service to all preachers of death!
<BR>
&nbsp;I call it the state where everyone, good and bad, is a poison-drinker:
<BR>
&nbsp;the state where everyone, good and bad, loses himself: the state
<BR>
&nbsp;where universal slow suicide is called -- life.&quot; [emphasis added]
