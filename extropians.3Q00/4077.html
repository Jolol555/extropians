----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20E.S.P.%20in%20the%20Turing%20Test&In-Reply-To=&lt;001501c015d7$e939b8c0$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">neptune@mars.superlink.net</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>I snipped some stuff here where Techno talks about the philosophy of
<BR>
representationalism.
<BR>
<P><P>I'm not familiar with this 'philosophy,' but I can tell already that it
<BR>
isn't what I'm talking about, although at first glance it appear remarkably
<BR>
similar.
<BR>
<P>In fact, the position I hold is one I believe is relatively uncontested--
<BR>
when I look at an object, I receive signals bounced off of it's surface that
<BR>
reveal it's properties.  This is not a philosophy, it is a verifiable
<BR>
observation.
<BR>
<P>The philosophy arises from the conclusions that we may choose to make about
<BR>
this state of affairs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another flaw with representationalism is that once things are pushed back
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the representations, there is no need of the external object.  In fact, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one cannot be aware of the external world and can only be aware of images
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the mental theater, how can one be sure there is an external world at all?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One can't if representationalism is granted as true.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why is this a flaw?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; I could go on.  Alien beings may perceive 'reality' in a totally
</EM><BR>
different
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fashion from us.  What you call an orange pen, they may describe in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; radically different terms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree, but this does not invalidate perception -- ours or theirs.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think it 'invalidates' perception either.  It simply is an
<BR>
illustration of its inherent limitations.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A
<BR>
<EM>&gt; colorblind person still perceives the same reality as me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Except the reality of color.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;She is missing an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; aspect of it that I can experience.  Yet given enough information, she can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come to see color exists though for her it will never be directly
</EM><BR>
perceived.
<BR>
<P>I don't quite understand this.  What sort of information are you talking
<BR>
about?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It will be akin to me using an infrared camera.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, and when you use and infrared camera, you're -not- seeing infrared.
<BR>
The camera is taking infrared signals and interpreting them into visible
<BR>
light.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;We&quot; (my mouse and I) are simply brains in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; box, sending and receiving signals to and from existence.  When we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to disassociate ourselves from our physical models of the universe, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enable our brains to penetrate deeper into the substrate.  We cling to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tactile conceptualization of reality-- objects 'moving' around, etc.
</EM><BR>
Hey,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it's a very good working model for our current condition, but it is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; construct that is ultimately limiting.  We might dismiss the theoretical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; physicists who want to describe reality as vacuum fluctuations, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; collapsing wave forms, but these people are pointing at deeper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; constructions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What you are doing here is setting up the notion that perceptions are
</EM><BR>
false
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and models that abstract from them are true.  But the models are built up
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; perceptions.  So, if the former are wrong, so are the latter.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not exactly saying that perceptions are false... simply that perceptions
<BR>
are limited.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; And I do not.  I am of the understanding that on this planet we are
</EM><BR>
barely
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the intelligence to walk around upright and dress ourselves.  I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; quite prepared to make definitive statements about the nature of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just yet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Awareness is always limited, but this does not mean it is not aware of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality.  A young child might be aware that it's a sunny day without being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aware of how the sun produces energy, how far away it is, what drives the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weather, and how her sensory systems work.  You appear to be setting up a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; false dichotomy from either knowing everything or knowing nothing.  If so,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how can you know your senses are limited?  Or that we are barely aware?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I am trying to topple a false dichotomy- one absolute reality vs.
<BR>
nothing is real.  To be clear, I don't think we know nothing!  I think we're
<BR>
at an interesting point in the journey.  Our monkey brains are starting to
<BR>
run into some problems, that much is certain-- our classical understanding
<BR>
of reality is being challenged by the increasingly abstract interactions of
<BR>
sub-atomic particles and quantum mechanics.  We've been equipped with the
<BR>
tools to understand reality on a particular level, and we've really done a
<BR>
great job with what we have.  But our sensory mode of existence can be a
<BR>
handicap, insofar as we persist in intepreting events in the context of a
<BR>
physical universe.
<BR>
<P>A child on a sunny day is receiving information about her environment.  That
<BR>
information is not the environment.
<BR>
<P>Let us suppose that there -is- an external reality out there.  That reality
<BR>
is sending the child a signal.  The child's mind interprets that data and
<BR>
forms a lattice of sensations-- a group of mental constructs that allow the
<BR>
child to navigate the information.  It is her interface with reality.
<BR>
<P>To repeat: her mind/computer is interpreting data and creating a mental
<BR>
world that acts as her interface to reality.  That mental world is not the
<BR>
reality itself, but rather a very useful representation of a particular
<BR>
slice of it.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Ah, you see, now you've started this conversation down what I consider
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the interesting road.  I -do- believe in a type of reality-- the realm
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I would like to discuss this with you, because it's a topic of great
<BR>
interest to me.  But I'd be opening a can of worms.  :)  A lot of very
<BR>
intelligent people on this list would start to post some very intelligent
<BR>
objections to what I was saying and, well, to be frank, I'm extremely busy
<BR>
right now.
<BR>
<P>In fact, I'd like to state right now for the record that you folks are way
<BR>
too damn stimulating and you've successfully robbed me (again and again) of
<BR>
precious hours that I could have more judiciously applied towards the
<BR>
development of a revolutionary entertainment property.
<BR>
<P>As a personal favor to me, I hope that you will all agree to reduce the
<BR>
quality of the ongoing discussions on this list to a point where I am able
<BR>
to reclaim significant portions of my mindshare.
<BR>
<P>As a jumping off point, I would like to propose the following two topics:
<BR>
a) Needlepoint, a retrospective: our ancient heritage, and b) Baseball.
<BR>
<P>Thank you for your cooperation.
<BR>
