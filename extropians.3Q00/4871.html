<P><EM>&gt;Somehow I doubt you actually tried this.  The results are not very good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at all.   You would have to position the pages well (no mean trick as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they aren't exactly 8-1/2 * 11 usually) flip the stack of pages over to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scan both sides, have the OCR or post processing paste the results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;together in a continuous narrative, post process a lot more with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really good dictionary/grammar program to try to fix the 10% or so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minimum OCR errors likely fro the process thus far and still have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pretty major editing job to make the results really good.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not tried to do this.  I have been told by people who routinely
<BR>
move material onto on-line that this is the procedure they use.  
<BR>
<P>There are gotchas, but not as many as you list.  The pages don't have to
<BR>
be well-positioned.  High-end software can automatically correct for
<BR>
page orientation.  Flipping the stack takes three seconds.  Pasting the
<BR>
results into the right order is also fast.  Good OCR will get at least
<BR>
98% accuracy.  And who said the posted result is error-free?
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, they could just be retyping the books.
<BR>
<P>ProCD was one of the first companies to sell CDs of phone directories.
<BR>
They tried the OCR approach and found it took too much work to get the
<BR>
quality they were shooting for.  So they hired hundreds of young Chinese
<BR>
women, paying them pennies an hour, to retype the phone books.  Each entry 
<BR>
is typed in by two different people.  If the two match, the entry is
<BR>
accepted.  If they differ, a third person, more literate in English,
<BR>
determines which is correct.
