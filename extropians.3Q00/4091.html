<EM>&gt; Corporations are a matter of people getting together cooperatively to

<EM>&gt; organize their efforts.  How can it be evil for a group of people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; voluntarily organize, and to offer jobs to others?  Every aspect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the process, from the formation of the corporation, to the job offer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the acceptance, is voluntary and agreed to by all concerned.

<P>Actually, corporations receive limitations on their liability.  So if,
<BR>
for example, a simple business partnership up the block from me
<BR>
accidentally causes my house to be blown up, I might be able to
<BR>
successfully sue the business owners to recover damages.  But if the
<BR>
very same people have organized the otherwise identical business as a
<BR>
corporation and do the very same thing, due to their magical limited
<BR>
liability, the corporation must pay but the stockholders do not, since
<BR>
their liability is limited.  Now, perhaps the corporation does not
<BR>
possess the resources to pay, but the stockholders do.  In that case I
<BR>
believe I would be out of luck.  Of course there are sometimes ways to
<BR>
&quot;pierce the corporate veil&quot; (sounds exciting doesn't it?).  And
<BR>
different standards of liability apply in different cases.  IANAL.
<BR>
But still, people incorporate for the liability limitations.
<BR>
<P>The only difference in the two instances could be that in the first
<BR>
case the business might be a simple partnership, and in the second
<BR>
case it was a corporation, having duly filed &quot;articles of
<BR>
incorporation&quot; with the secretary of state of the state of
<BR>
Massachusetts.  And therefore in one case I can recover damages from
<BR>
the business owners and in the other case I might not.  This strikes
<BR>
me as something which materially affects me to which I never agreed.
<BR>

<BR>
