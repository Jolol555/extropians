<EM>&gt; &gt; If I wanted to have an argument, I would write more like M. Lorrey or L.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't view it as adversarial. I view it more as an attempt by all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; parties to discover something new, together. More of a cooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; push/pull towards some undiscovered country of the mind (and all it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; entails), rather than a here's my opinion, bow down. If you'd rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have an &quot;argument&quot; I'll oblige, but I'd rather not if it's all the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to you. =)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ha. Well, I understand that some people view my conversational manner as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confrontational or argumentative. I know that in plenty of my posts, I do lose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patience with opinions or statements that I see as uninformed or in willful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; denial of the facts, even after the facts have been clearly posted and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; referenced. People who prefer to think the best of themselves obviously resent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I call them by their proper names, names they deserve if they are to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I try not to call anyone names. The portion of people that I see through
<BR>
fora such as this is very tiny as to their actual being, as well as
<BR>
being a medium that seems at times to thrive on miscommunications. What
<BR>
I will do is call into question their statements, their use of
<BR>
words/phrasology, their logic and reasoning, their assumptions, etc.,
<BR>
but rarely, if ever, will I call into question their character. It seems
<BR>
counterproductive and often fosters more road blocks to useful
<BR>
communication. Now, don't get me wrong Mike (if I may take the liberty).
<BR>
Your style of communication is one that I enjoy in that you are very
<BR>
straightforward and do not mince words. I suppose that I tend to give
<BR>
others the benefit of the doubt more so than I should, but at the end of
<BR>
the day I can honestly say that I tried to be very reasonable in
<BR>
understanding others. It just doesn't seem profitable to engender anger
<BR>
in others over a set of topics if in the future they may be able to
<BR>
present information to me on other topics in a manner I agree with, but
<BR>
I would never realize because I called them something less than
<BR>
pleasant. Do you agree?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; beleive the things they do without significant thought. Other people who do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like to have their most cherished misconceptions challenged dislike dealing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself, or Lee, or others on the list who do not suffer fools so gladly as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others seem willing to do. Being of the school that 'that which does not kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I might argue they dislike dealing with you (and L. Crocker) not because
<BR>
their misconceptions are challenged, but rather due to the manner in
<BR>
which they are confronted. Which do you think is more engendering of an
<BR>
exchange of information? 1)&quot;Your opinion is unfounded, because of x.&quot;,
<BR>
versus 2)&quot;Your ignorance is showing, because of x.&quot; It's a question of
<BR>
style, I suppose. And like anything in that subjective realm, is open to
<BR>
interpretation, granted. For me, my style is an approach based on
<BR>
eliciting communication, not reducing the conversation to mudslinging.
<BR>
Which is in no way meant to imply that you (and L. Crocker) do this on
<BR>
this purpose. But, it does seem to happen frequently with the
<BR>
discussions you have with others that you disagree with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you makes you stronger', I look at my adversarial manner, which IMHO I actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rarely release in full force, as a tool by which others may improve themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
It seems slightly disingenuous of you to live by this creed unless you
<BR>
make it clear upfront. If you come to the table of conversation thinking
<BR>
of war, then of course I'm going to lose. How do I get stronger, if I'm
<BR>
crushed right off the bat leaving me with no emotional fortitude to
<BR>
explain that my last post had an unfortunate typo? A silly example, to
<BR>
be sure, but the point is illustrative. IMHO, it's very easy to be
<BR>
adversarial, it's very difficult to elicit cooperative communication.
<BR>
For me, I'd rather improve my skills at the latter than the former. It's
<BR>
hard enough understanding people you are very close to, let alone
<BR>
someone I only see written words from. Name calling seems to make the
<BR>
odds even worse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know that when others come back at me to bring my own misconceptions to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention, it does improve me as well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Very true. Let me ask you this: How would you want those misconceptions
<BR>
presented to you?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That being said, I do not come to the list 'looking for an argument', however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as seen in the stats posted regarding the percent of the population that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beleives in creationism, there is obviously a large chunk of the population that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is living in Egypt at any given time...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I'll be the first to let my stupidity and ignorance show and say I have
<BR>
no idea what this means. The Egypt part, that is. =)
