<EM>&gt; &gt;If you define art as stuff that makes people change their minds or forces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them to deal with issues, then there is no way to distinguish art from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;non-art and the term becomes meaningless.  A death in the family forces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people to deal with issues.  Is it art too?  Being mugged will change
</EM><BR>
lots
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of people.  Is mugging an art form?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Although I've seen it cited as such, I regard changing people's minds,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forcing them to deal with something, or evoking an emotional response as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; frequent consequences of art, not central to the definition of art.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree it is a often a consequence, but then a lot of non-art does that
<BR>
too.  You can't choose a nonessential trait to demarcate something,
<BR>
especially when it is shared by things radically different than that thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Natasha and Nadia should really weigh in on this one.  The definition of
</EM><BR>
art
<BR>
<EM>&gt; keeps moving, and it often takes generations for the borders to move.  I
</EM><BR>
know
<BR>
<EM>&gt; that my own opinions don't keep up.  The art world says that Jackson
</EM><BR>
Pollack,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Christo, and Karen Finley are artists; I'm not convinced.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think the definition keeps moving.  The Establishment's definition
<BR>
has undergone lots of changes, though for the last few decades either the
<BR>
authoritarian (art is what artists say it is; something becomes art by
<BR>
someone calling it art) or the institutional (art is what the artworld say
<BR>
it is; something becomes art if enough accepted artists, critics,
<BR>
historians, curators, and patrons call it art) definitions have held sway.
<BR>
These definitions are not really definitions at all, but shallow appeals to
<BR>
authority.  They do not serve the function of a definition -- to make it
<BR>
easy to delineate between things and understand their natures better -- but
<BR>
do serve to keep the current strains of non-art up in value, both in terms
<BR>
of money and status.
<BR>
<P>I stick pretty close to Rand's defintion: art is a &quot;selective re-creation of
<BR>
reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments.&quot; (_The
<BR>
Romanctic Manifesto_, p19)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Eduardo Kac is a self-described performance artist.  His intent was not
</EM><BR>
just
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to produce the bunny but to interact with it on stage.  So this is
</EM><BR>
probably
<BR>
<EM>&gt; art by current definitions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think *this* bunny is art by itself but I think that genemods per
</EM><BR>
se
<BR>
<EM>&gt; can be an art form as much as any other.  Perhaps in the same category as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bodybuilding, topiary, perfume, cooking, architecture, and clothing
</EM><BR>
design.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Being useful doesn't make an endeavor any less art.  (Or does it?  Must
</EM><BR>
art
<BR>
<EM>&gt; serve no functional purpose to qualify as art?  I say no.)
</EM><BR>
<P>A fine art is defined partly by not being for other uses.  Design and
<BR>
craft -- such as in architecture, pottery, and clothing -- is for use and
<BR>
that limits the amount of expression available to the maker of it.  Thus,
<BR>
cooks can make anything they want.  The meal has to be edible, for example.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What new art forms will arise as consequences of anticipated technological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developments?  Besides genemods, I think that personalities could become
</EM><BR>
an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; art form.  We already consider acting to be an art form; if you could
</EM><BR>
precisely
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sculpt a personality, wouldn't that qualify?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there might be new arts created, but there will still be a boundary
<BR>
between art and non-art.  It's kind of like evolution.  New life comes
<BR>
about, but it still life and typically easily distinguishable from non-life.
<BR>
(And the oft used counterexample of viruses is a borderline case that has
<BR>
been around for probably all of life's history.  It's not some new fangled
<BR>
challenge to the definition of life.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't forget Heinlein's &quot;The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag&quot;:  SI
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; artist, universe as art.  What about creating a religion?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My own guess is that any deliberately constructed object or action can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assessed from an artistic point of view.  Art requires an artist.  So a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sunset is aesthetic, but it is not art (unless you bring in the God
</EM><BR>
thing).
<BR>
<P>The authoritarian definition of art rears its ugly head here, once more.:)
<BR>
<P>I agree an artistic object must be human made.  But this is not the be all,
<BR>
do all of art.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure if art requires that the creator(s) have had the intent to
</EM><BR>
create
<BR>
<EM>&gt; art per se.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the intention matters to some extent because artists tend to create
<BR>
art objects (paintings, symphonies, novels, poems, dances, sculptures,
<BR>
dramas) for different reasons than non-art objects.  The function has an
<BR>
impact on the creation.  For art objects, the goal is to make an object only
<BR>
for the experience of that object -- not for some other use.  (To the degree
<BR>
the so called artist has some other goal in mind, the piece becomes less
<BR>
art.  Thus, advertising jingles are not art per se.  They hug the border
<BR>
since they serve the practical end of selling a product.  Doesn't mean it's
<BR>
always easy to place that border or there aren't mixed cases.)
<BR>
<P>Art always, too, involves an aspect of imitation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One could certainly make an aesthetic assessment of lying, sex, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; car engines; is an artistic intent required to label it as art?
</EM><BR>
<P>None of those are arts in the sense of fine arts.  (If you use &quot;art&quot; to mean
<BR>
&quot;skill&quot; or &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;body of knowledge,&quot; then, of course, we are talking
<BR>
something different here.  But people who argue mutant bunnies are art do
<BR>
not mean that, I'm sure.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;My ethical point was to question whether such experiments should be done
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;conscious beings.  I've not against genetic engineering per se.  This
</EM><BR>
does
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;not mean, however, anything goes.  I'm not for, and I doubt many on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;list are for, kidnapping people and using them genetic experiments.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your question about conscious beings is legitimate.  A key point though is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we've been genetically modifying conscious beings -- humans, pets,
</EM><BR>
working
<BR>
<EM>&gt; animals, and farm animals -- for our purposes already, without consent,
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; millenia.  Direct genemod is just a more efficient mechanism than
</EM><BR>
selective
<BR>
<EM>&gt; breeding.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not singling out genetic engineering here.  I call into question of all
<BR>
nonconsensual uses of conscious beings.  Past uses and abuses do not forgive
<BR>
current or future ones, any more than someone arguing, &quot;Well, we've always
<BR>
killed fill-in-the-blank-for-some-ethnic-group-here with clubs, knives, and
<BR>
guns.  Why shouldn't we use more efficient mechanisms of killing them?&quot;  (I
<BR>
should talk!  I'm one of the stokers of the uplifting thread here.:)
<BR>
<P>Don't get me wrong here.  I'm not against genetic engineering.  I merely
<BR>
question its value if it's only to make funny colored rabbits.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
