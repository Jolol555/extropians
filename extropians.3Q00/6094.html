<EM>&gt; &gt; No, it doesn't. You and I don't have the same auto insurance or health care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; policies, do we? Yet we still get along fine, and nobody is sending other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people's kids to their deaths over car insurance, are they? The only common
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; agreement by individuals in society is for each individual to respect and honor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the contracts they agree to with other individuals, and to not initiate force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; against others. You and I don't have to want to exercise the same rights, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; long as those rights either don't conflict, or don't conflict without just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; compensation. If I carry a firearm, and you don't, you are externalizing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; security risk onto me to include you in the security umbrella that the implied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; threat my being armed provides (and the presence of a weapon does not constitute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use of force, BTW). Such a scenario can be easily mitigated by a system of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bounties or rewards in those instances when I do in fact take concrete actions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to provide you with protection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So, to take a classic case, what happens when your security/law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement body decides to haul me away on some charge that makes since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to your law making agency but my law making agency and security/law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enforcement utterly disagrees?  Who decides the issue?  Do they fight it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out?  What next level body and set of rules do they appeal to?
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets say your policy with your PPL states 'no death penalty for murder'. Mine
<BR>
mandates it for murder. Every PPL contract mandates no initiation of force. You
<BR>
kill me. My PPL arrests you, and because you breached your 'no initiation of
<BR>
force' clause in your contract, your PPL is not obligated to prevent your
<BR>
execution, although they are obligated to determine if you actually initiated
<BR>
force against me unprovoked, or were defending yourself against my initiation,
<BR>
or whether your actions were the result of accident or negligence. They thus
<BR>
provide your defense in arbitration with prosecutors from my PPL. Arbitrators
<BR>
would be independent of both parties. Prosecution would pay for the trial,
<BR>
subject to recovery from the convicted if a conviction results.
<BR>
<P>Private law is nothing new. 99% of legal action between the USPS and the postal
<BR>
unions are in fact done on a private basis with arbitrators already. According
<BR>
to my postal union friends, it costs about 1/4 as much as going the public court
<BR>
route, they do have a body of precedent of past arbitration to work from (I
<BR>
designed a judgement search database for one of the regional union arbitration
<BR>
reps), and so long as the union does its job to take care of its members, the
<BR>
system works quite well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not see how multiplying the number of private law providers and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; enforcers actually makes life and cooperative, predicatable activity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; more likely.  On the surface it seems to add extra levels of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; complication.  Problems that did have on central body of law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; arbitrators now have N such bodies.  These bodies act similarly to small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; States in this respect.  So domestic conflicts are escalated into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; international (er, inter-syndicate?) ones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Socialists do not see how multiplying the number of private product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; manufacturers and distributors actually makes life better, more cooperative and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more efficient for all, which is why they simply DO NOT GET capitalism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Predictability is irrelevant, unless you are a fascist control freak. Adding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; complexity to systems (like markets) makes them more robust. Having n bodies of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law ensures that if any one fails to serve adequately, the market for private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; law will resolve the issue bloodlessly, allowing consumers to obtain their law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from bodies of law which do provide adequate levels of justice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Arguing from analogy does nothing to address the point raised.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Predictability of a reasonable degree is quite relevant if you want a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generally sane and peaceful society where conflicts do not become armed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflicts too often.  Calling names is even weaker than using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inapplicable analogies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, tell me this: Why do you think centralized control is so godawful
<BR>
important? It should be pretty emminently accepted by now that centralizing
<BR>
control of anything tends to cause more abuse and violation of trust than
<BR>
decentralization. My analogy holds, because there is little difference between
<BR>
socialized law, socialized medicine, socialized employment, or socialized
<BR>
anything. You ought to be smart enough to see that.
