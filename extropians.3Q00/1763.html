</EM><BR>
<P>Greg, I know there was a very recent game that is, in a sense, the spiritual
<BR>
sucessor to MS Space Simulator.  A search turned up a few mentions - I think
<BR>
it might have been developed by Interplay, but I can't find it mentioned on
<BR>
their site.  I'm pretty sure it was called simply &quot;Shuttle&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Frontier: Elite 2 had a (supposedly) realistic physics model and an accurate
<BR>
model of the entire galaxy (except the space stations and extrasolar
<BR>
planets, of course).  The technology was pure fiction though.  Apparently
<BR>
Elite 3, which is currently in production, will offer an even more accurate
<BR>
simulation.  (However, if you have even a slightly addictive personality
<BR>
don't go anywhere near Elite or it's sequels.)
<BR>
<P>You might also want to check out,
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://openuniverse.sourceforge.net/">http://openuniverse.sourceforge.net/</A>
<BR>
<P>OpenUniverse simulates the solar system, including spaceships.  Apparently
<BR>
you can control the space shuttle, although I doubt it's an accurate
<BR>
simulation.
