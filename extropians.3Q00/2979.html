<EM>&gt; &gt; Evangelical Christians will consider [ID implants] an early harbinger of the rule of the Antichrist which they believe is coming.  I will be interested to see to what extent they protest this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I also wonder how fast it well be till tyrannical gov'ts institute this technology by force to closely monitor dissidents?  How much will the world protest this?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The notion is that as transparency increases, people are ever more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; motivated to overthrow tyrannical governments.  If *every* action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is open to the light of day, then anything that does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directly harm another person is legal, moral and ethical.  True
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom is not getting away with something that is illegal [but shouldnt be.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; True freedom is not having a bunch of stupid laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mike Lorrey et.al, think over this deal for a minute.  What if...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; EVERYTHING that anyone does is visible to everyone.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; return, YOU get to make the laws.  Design a system that will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work under those circs, including a means of paying the few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cops that will likely still be needed, etc, a prison system for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the dangerous few that still desperately need imprisonment, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spike
</EM><BR>
<P>I can think of many reasons why this won't happen:
<BR>
<P>a) the leadership will simply pipe in fake video coverage, set up PRIOR
<BR>
to  when the transparency became available to everyone, and they will
<BR>
still have privacy.
<BR>
b) all right and good thinking people will sure as hell not want 'that
<BR>
twisted fuck' down the street to i) have a say in what is legal to do
<BR>
and ii) be anywhere near their kids. If you think there is a problem now
<BR>
with sexual offenders resettling into the community and people going
<BR>
vigilante on them, think again what will happen with transparency.
<BR>
People are only tolerant so long as you don't rub your 'perversions' in
<BR>
their faces, so they don't have to think about it. Make it so it can't
<BR>
be avoided, and give the busy bodies the means to put a 'Mrs. Grundy' in
<BR>
every neighborhood, and we'll have a period of significant violence,
<BR>
followed by the most repressive vanilla society, you think the Saudi and
<BR>
Iranian religious police are bad? 
<BR>
c) people will be very happy when the government stomps its foot down on
<BR>
dissidents and deviants, right up until the government decides THEY are
<BR>
dissidents and deviants.

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
