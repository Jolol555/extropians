<EM>&gt; No, I'd rather not have an argument either.  Now that's something that's

<EM>&gt; likely to interfere with communication, isn't it?

<P>Excellent post Bonnie. One thing I've found with city folk is that they are
<BR>
usually of two minds: either they think talking with animals is ludicrous, or
<BR>
else they sincerely beleive it to be true due to one too many Bambi cartoons,
<BR>
but don't have the slightest clue about it AND insist that our ability to
<BR>
communicate with them somehow makes it wrong to eat them.
<BR>
I've chatted with red squirrels, chipmunks, beaver, pine martens, badgers,
<BR>
coyotes, and deer. Moose are too dumb to communicate with, they are barely aware
<BR>
of their own existence and their surroundings (I think its a physiological thing
<BR>
due to brain worms, but not sure), though they can probably relate to the plants
<BR>
they eat pretty well. I've tickled trout and fed eagles, who resent you catching
<BR>
'their' fish, but are not too proud to take it from you... As a boy I once was
<BR>
convinced I had developed rapport with a lobster during a summer in Maine. By
<BR>
the time he was cooked and in my belly, I was sure of it.
<BR>
Bucks are rather smart, I've been outsmarted by many on the hunt, as has many a
<BR>
hunter, but if you learn their tricks, you can catch them in the act, and BOY
<BR>
does that surprise them. You can learn to talk to deer quite fluently (I
<BR>
recommend the book _Deer Talk_), I've seen people call them up to their kitchen
<BR>
windows.
