<EM>&gt; For a practical example, take a market for transplant organs: I'm an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; average guy with failing liver - a new one would be of great value to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me - and I can beg, borrow, and, steal perhaps $1,000,000 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; literally save my life. You, on the other hand, are a fantastically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wealthy industrialist, worth more billions than you can conceivably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spend the interest on, and you happen to like eating human liver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cooked, whipped, and spread on crackers. Since $10,000,000 is worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing to you, you easily out bid me. 
</EM><BR>
<P>To resolve this paradox you have to look at how the billionaire got
<BR>
his money.  Assuming he acquired it legally, he (or his ancestors) did
<BR>
something so incredibly valuable to the human race that people rewarded
<BR>
him with billions and billions and billions of dollars.  This was society's
<BR>
way of saying thank you for the huge benefit he provided to mankind.
<BR>
<P>Now, when he eats liver, he is taking the reward from that debt of
<BR>
thanks humanity owes him.  It may seem unfortunate that he is able to
<BR>
command resources that could mean so much more to someone else, but that
<BR>
is the only way society was able to say thank you in a meaningful way.
<BR>
In effect, humanity thanked him by giving him their livers, even though
<BR>
others wanted them more.
