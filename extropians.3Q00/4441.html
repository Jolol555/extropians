<P><EM> &gt; 	There is the kicker - &quot;no competition&quot;!  In the past we had to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; compete to survive.  That is the law when there is no other more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligent way to progress.  But once anyone or anything achieves the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligence required to progress more intentionally than via
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; all the rules change drastically.

<P>Escaping from evolution is tricky.  If you have
<BR>
<P>(1) replicating agents
<BR>
(2) mutation
<BR>
(3) limited resources
<BR>
<P>you automatically get evolution as well.  Evolution is not a physical
<BR>
law.  It's something higher, independent of physical systems.  It's
<BR>
math.  I'm not sure what the right term is--a &quot;principle&quot;?
<BR>
<P>People seem to think that if you replace random, natural mutation
<BR>
by self-tinkering, you have done away with (2) from above.  Which
<BR>
is nonsense.  All you have done is having replaced one kind of
<BR>
mutation with another one.  If you feel like engaging in semantic
<BR>
squabbling over the term &quot;mutation&quot;, feel free to substitute a
<BR>
better term in (2).
<BR>
<P>Doing away with replication may look like a good way to stop
<BR>
evolution from occurring.  The problem with that is that as soon
<BR>
as an agent develops by mutation the ability to replicate, it will
<BR>
steamroller the statics.  Note that *self*-replication is not a
<BR>
necessary condition.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; No longer are we competing, now we are communicating and sharing.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; If anyone anywhere grows, learns, and so on and so forth, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; better for us all.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are lunch.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; What a lonely, hideous, and non diverse place this universe would
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; be with only the single most advanced being having destroyed and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; consumed everything else.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are thinking long-term enough, that scenario is rather
<BR>
plausible.
