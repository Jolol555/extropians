<EM>&gt; very very long shot.
</EM><BR>
<P>To express how strongly I feel it isn't that long a shot, I would give
<BR>
*strong* consideration to being the volunteer whose frozen brain is
<BR>
&quot;dropped&quot; (ooops...) (in a room that is at sub-zero temperatures).
<BR>
So long as they sweep up the pieces and put them back in the jar
<BR>
(frozen of course), I'll most likely be fine.
<BR>
<P>Of course I suspect there are others that might know a bit more about
<BR>
this than me who would disagree.  But they aren't the ones who have
<BR>
done the calculations on the computational capacity of MBrains.
<BR>
<P>Now of course, figuring out how to get an MBrain that *wants* to put
<BR>
me back together -- thats a whole different question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You think your freezers will survive a World War and rationing??...
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, this raises an interesting question -- what do people view
<BR>
as the probability of a World War at this time?
<BR>
<P>If they believe the priority is high, then the solution is for Alcor
<BR>
to get a solar powered LN2 plant.  I know that they have looked into
<BR>
this, but right now it isn't cost effective.  But they could rapidly
<BR>
change their mind in the event of unrest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think LE people should pool financial resources and get the research going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NOW... more money ...more progress... surely LE folks worldwide could raise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $20 million (...maybe Robert Bradbury could advise on the best way such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money could be &quot;invested&quot; into hard LE research...). The payoffs are after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the only real wealth... CONTINUED EXISTENCE.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Maximum Life Foundation will probably work on this.  And they are
<BR>
looking to raise a lot more money than that in the long run.  However
<BR>
the greatest thing you could do as Extropians is (a) educate yourself;
<BR>
(b) write about it; (c) communicate personally with others.  One
<BR>
of the barriers that organizations like MLF, LEF, etc. are up against
<BR>
is the &quot;flakery&quot; of some current LE efforts and the paradigm that
<BR>
this problem cannot be solved.  That is what you need to shift --
<BR>
personal commitment is much more effective at that than gobs of $$$.
<BR>
Also, it is important to note that one of the things that is true
<BR>
in Science is that it is very difficult to &quot;push on a string&quot;.
<BR>
Until you have the necessary foundation, you may spend a lot
<BR>
of money for very few results (if any).
