<EM>&gt; Ok, maybe I'm a victim of all the hype or maybe I just have the mentality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a ten year old but I really don't think the colossal success of the
</EM><BR>
Harry Potter
<BR>
<EM>&gt; books is a fluke. They're very well crafted, exciting, and the most
</EM><BR>
enjoyable pure
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fantasy books I ever read. The last one might be a bit too violent and
</EM><BR>
scary if your
<BR>
<EM>&gt; children are very young however.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've heard many good things about the series from adults who have read them.
<BR>
I've also heard lots of bad things from adults who haven't read them.  I
<BR>
tend to think the latter get too uptight.  Yeah, I do see kids getting
<BR>
wrapped up in Harry Potter, but so what?  Kids (and adults) get wrapped up
<BR>
in all sorts of things, from _Star Trek_ to the latest top forty band.  I
<BR>
wonder what those who criticize the Potter books want?  Kids to only get
<BR>
into things they got into when they were young?
<BR>
<P>No doubt, some of it is religious resistence -- Christian fundamentalists
<BR>
trying to satve off any competition to their belief system.  That's one
<BR>
reason a lot of the same crowd was against Dungeons and Dragons back in the
<BR>
1970s -- it trivialized religion and choices of belief system by making them
<BR>
into a game.
<BR>
<P>Anyhow, I'm not and never was a big fantasy reader anyway...  But I do have
<BR>
some favorites in this genre (fantasy), including Poul Anderson's _Operation
<BR>
Chaos_, Peter S. Beagle's _The Last Unicorn_, and Lord Dunsany's _King of
<BR>
Elfland's Daughter_.  I wonder if anyone else has similar tastes.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
