<EM>&gt; &gt; Uh, actually this argument fails to sway because it defines theft in
</EM><BR>
very
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; simplistic terms.  You might not be stealing my music if you copy it,
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you certainly are stealing my profit.  If you desire something that I
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; spent energy producing, then it is clear that we should come to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; arrangement by which I should end up with something that you have spent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; energy producing (like, er, money for instance.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are you saying that now I have to pay you for this response you just gave
</EM><BR>
me?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; How much do you want, I'll get out my credit card number?  What?  This
</EM><BR>
isn't the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; same?  How so?  You exerted creative energy coming up with it didn't you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well... to be truthful, not very much.  But you're welcome to send me a
<BR>
check if it moved you.
<BR>
<P><P>Your slippery slope argument is is... uh... dumb.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Oh, what, you want to protect your ideas?!  Oh, I suppose you're going to
<BR>
want to charge for every word you speak!  I suppose you're going to want to
<BR>
charge people for seeing what you look like it public!  I suppose you're
<BR>
going to want to track down every time your name is uttered and send someone
<BR>
a bill!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Isn't there a nice reasonable attractor state somewhere between &quot;absolute
<BR>
dictatorial control over IP&quot; and &quot;absolute elimination of IP?&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; By your argument, it should be legal to counterfeit money.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, now there's a great idea!
</EM><BR>
<P>Strangely enough, millions would disagree.  I guess they have some naive
<BR>
notion that it might devalue the entire economy.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In fact, intellectual property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; laws protect... intellectual property, which by definition, has always
</EM><BR>
been
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tremendously easy to duplicate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not so, that's the whole point of the RIAA lawsuit regardless of anything
</EM><BR>
else
<BR>
<EM>&gt; they say.  They certainly are not arguing on the behalf of the artists.
</EM><BR>
If they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; were, then why are the only paying these poor bastards less than a dollar
</EM><BR>
per
<BR>
<EM>&gt; CD?  Where is all that other money going.  Lets see, I'm thinking for a
</EM><BR>
moment -
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I got it - the executives paychecks!!  Lets not forget those multi-million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollar hyping budgets in order to get N'Sync and Brittany Spears albums to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market.  Give me a friggin break!
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmm, I'm not following this argument.  Would you mind trying again?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; No, actually, the real difference here is that blacksmiths were being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; replaced by something that did their job better.  That's called
</EM><BR>
progress.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exactly!  The internet is progress, so why don't you tell the RIAA to get
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; hell out of the way!
</EM><BR>
<P>Now I'm as much in favor of the Internet as anyone, but I also don't blindly
<BR>
equate its evolution with 'progress.'  IMO, that's part of the problem
<BR>
here-- some automatically assume that the Internet can do no wrong and just
<BR>
want to make its progress as unimpeded as possible.  I, on the other hand,
<BR>
think it might be charming if we little humans had some say in where things
<BR>
went next.
<BR>
<P>He made it, he promoted it, I listen to it.  I hear it on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the radio, I hear it on MTV.  I recorded it on MTV.  I play it whenever I
</EM><BR>
want.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Then along comes Napster and I can find the same song and record it on my
</EM><BR>
hard
<BR>
<EM>&gt; drive - and now it's a crime?  This is the most convoluted crap I have
</EM><BR>
ever been
<BR>
<EM>&gt; dis-privaleged to expose my brain to.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me try to simplify it for you then:
<BR>
<P>Scenario A: He make music.  Radio promote music.  He sell music.  Radio sell
<BR>
advertising.
<BR>
Result A: They provide a service and get paid for it.
<BR>
<P>Scenario B: He make music.  You take music.
<BR>
Result B: They provide a service and not get paid for it.
<BR>
<P><P>So what's motivating them
<BR>
<EM>&gt; - perhaps the pure love of music?  Oh I forgot, its not about the music in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; end - its the money, money, moneyaaa, .....moneyaaaaa!
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's very nice that you want to rely on an individual's pure love of
<BR>
their art form to ensure high quality product.
<BR>
<P>Personally, when it comes to things like pharmaceuticals, automobile design,
<BR>
software development, etc, I don't mind if we throw in a handful of extra
<BR>
creators who happen to be profit motivated.  Hey, the people who do it for
<BR>
pure love can stay!
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; For now yes, but thats the whole point of my argument.  There is going to
</EM><BR>
come a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; point, when nanotechnology really hits hard and all this IP hogwash has to
</EM><BR>
go.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Because nanotechnology will give people the ability to replicate anything
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; want.  All intellectual property will do in the end, and increasingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; totalitarian measures will be needed, is create a nano divide that makes
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; current digital divide look like a toddlers dispute.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many communists use the argument that capitalism approaches fascism.  Again,
<BR>
these slippery slope arguments are reactionary.  I agree that vast economic
<BR>
gulfs already exist.  Does it follow that the solution is to eliminate
<BR>
ownership?  I suspect it probably is... I imagine that ye olde communist
<BR>
Russia had smaller economic gulfs than ye olde U.S. of A.
<BR>
<P>It appears to me that people who rail against the divide seem remarkably
<BR>
blind to a lot of the benefits unequal distribution of weath confers.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Ah yes, but intellectual property is being used to squash new technologies
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate the real potential of what the internet is.
</EM><BR>
<P>You say squash, I say foster.  You say these rules are crippling our growth,
<BR>
I say that they are responsible for it.  (Uh, we -are- growing, right?)
