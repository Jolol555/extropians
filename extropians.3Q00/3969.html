<EM>&gt; MEG and Joe live in Brightlands, a secure estate protected by a siren which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sounds whenever outsiders try to cross the barbed wire perimeter. They were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lucky to pass the vetting procedure because Joe's tag, for a 10-year-old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conviction, was removed only a few months ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is so unsafe to leave &quot;walled&quot; areas that they work from home, although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their computers are linked into the company network so their bosses can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell exactly when they log on and off.
</EM><BR>
<P>After considerable hunting, I found the actual report online at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.foresight.gov.uk/servlet/DocViewer/doc=883/CrimeConsultation.pdf">http://www.foresight.gov.uk/servlet/DocViewer/doc=883/CrimeConsultation.pdf</A>.
<BR>
<P>It's not as one-sided as the description above implies.  There are
<BR>
actually two scenarios explored at the end, one of a &quot;socially exclusive&quot;
<BR>
world (the above), and one of a &quot;socially inclusive&quot; world.  The latter
<BR>
is much more positive, although the scenario does depict a robbery
<BR>
(perhaps in order to show what lengths a robber must go to in 2020 -
<BR>
it isn't successful).
<BR>
<P>Crime has actually been decreasing for the past ten years (although
<BR>
in the UK there has been a slight uptick the past couple of years).
<BR>
The commission foresees an increase in crime due to demographics,
<BR>
and also to a supposed loss of social cohesiveness.  Everybody finds
<BR>
support on the net for their wild views, which encourages lawlessness -
<BR>
that seems to be the picture.
<BR>
<P>The report raises a number of interesting points regarding crime.
<BR>
What if nanotech allows on-site drug synthesis?  How should society
<BR>
handle the options for pervasive surveillance, and the technologies to
<BR>
evade observation?  What about other addictive technologies?
<BR>
<P>A couple of excerpts:
<BR>
<P>&quot;3.29.  The virtual world offers the potential for digital stimulation
<BR>
as an alternative to chemical drugs. The potentially addictive nature of
<BR>
the almost limitless uncensored information is cause for concern. The
<BR>
ability to spend extended periods of time consuming visual material
<BR>
(eg paedophilia) may prove to be addictive. In addition there may be
<BR>
ways to stimulate the brain through electronic images/interaction to
<BR>
produce effects currently limited to narcotics.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I don't think pedophilia is a good example here, because it's so
<BR>
inflammatory and raises many other issues.  But it is good to see them
<BR>
facing the possibility that if drugs are bad because they are addictive,
<BR>
maybe other addictive activities must be treated the same way.
<BR>
<P>&quot;3.4 Developments in the sequencing of the human genome over the next
<BR>
20 years will increase the information available from a DNA sample
<BR>
found at the scene of a crime. At present such a sample can only be
<BR>
matched to one already on the DNA database. In the future, however,
<BR>
for those where no match is found, the use of gene markers may allow
<BR>
identification of certain characteristics from a sample, better to
<BR>
target police investigations. While the identification is likely to be
<BR>
probabilistic rather than categorical, the characteristics which might
<BR>
be identified include: age, sex, race, eye colour, hair colour, facial
<BR>
characteristics, and stature traits. In other words, the investigator
<BR>
may have a description of the suspect from DNA, without any other forms
<BR>
of identification.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I hadn't thought of this application of DNA sequencing.  Even without
<BR>
a database or monitoring technology it may be possible to get a good
<BR>
physical description of a suspect.
<BR>
<P>Generally the report is worth reading, contrary to the impression one
<BR>
might get from that Telegraph article.
