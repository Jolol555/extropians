<EM>&gt; While I doubt anything said here will convince anyone, much less settle the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter, James above comments seem only to matter if the partnership or other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unincorporated business is run like an ownership.  I mean, why should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporate investors get off if partners don't?  The matter seems to be one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of managerial responsibility.  Corporate investors, in a sense, hire a board
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to manage the corporation, but partners and sole owners generally run it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>In both corporations and general partnerships, the active managers of the
<BR>
business can be held liable.  In both cases, investors who don't actively
<BR>
participate in the business (shareholders and limited partners,
<BR>
respectively) do not have liability beyond their investment.  The only
<BR>
time shareholders or limited partners can be held accountable is if the
<BR>
courts find that those individuals were in fact in charge of the
<BR>
day-to-day operation of the business.
<BR>
<P>While I know this list goes off on an &quot;evil corporation&quot; tangent
<BR>
occasionally, I have yet to understand why.  Most of the arguments seem to
<BR>
be based on a lack of knowledge about the legal details of the
<BR>
various officially recognized business structures.  More importantly, most
<BR>
of the problems that do arise with big corporations have far more to do
<BR>
with &quot;evil&quot; government than &quot;evil&quot; business anyway.
