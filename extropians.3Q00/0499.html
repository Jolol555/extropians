Interesting research. Of course, this kind of thing should be done on a 
<BR>
*much* larger scale; that would really help us to understand the brain. 
<BR>
Also, maybe it's time for us rational transhumanist types to get less 
<BR>
romantic about love, and see it for what it really is; a dangerous, 
<BR>
anti-individualistic, anti-intellectual addiction which (presumably) only 
<BR>
serves the &quot;interests&quot; of &quot;blind, selfish genes&quot;, not your own enlightened 
<BR>
self-interest. Being in love is about as &quot;transhuman&quot; as smoking crack. 
<BR>
&quot;But if feels so good&quot;...Yeah, sure it does, JUNKIE! To quote from the 
<BR>
article:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;These [&quot;love&quot;] parts of the brain are also the parts which are active in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;euphoric states generated by exogenous substances such as cocaine,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noted research partner Dr. Zeki. &quot;Romantic love is to for many people,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at any rate, intoxicating.&quot;
<BR>
<P>There's obviously nothing wrong with &quot;feeling intoxicated/euphoric&quot; 
<BR>
(feeling good is more or less the interim meaning of life, after all), but 
<BR>
such states should only be generated in a highly controlled, emotionally 
<BR>
autonomous mental structure. Anyway, here's the article...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True love may just be all in your head
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Jennifer Harper
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE WASHINGTON TIMES
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of love has fueled prim poesy and purple prose alike
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the eons. Now it has inspired a pair of methodical British
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neurologists who believe they can tell if someone is truly, madly and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deeply in love.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget tender looks, pounding hearts and sweet talk.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These love doctors believe the lovey-dovey instinct is all in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain the medial insula, the anterior cingulate, the striatum and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prefrontal cortex to be exact.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a research paper released yesterday, Drs. Semir Zeki
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Andreas Bartels of the University College London managed to get 17
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love-struck volunteers to be still long enough for a brain scan, under
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decidedly unromantic circumstances.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each volunteer was hooked up to a lie detector, then shown a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;photograph of his or her beloved. The same four regions of the brain
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lit up on the scans of each giddy subject, and those spots were quite
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specific.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regions are associated with gut feelings, a sense of reward,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;euphoria and depression certainly the hallmarks of love, if song and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;story are to be believed.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We were really struck by how clear cut the activity was,&quot; noted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Bartels. &quot;It's not surprising that we got a response in those
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular parts of the brain.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each test subject then was shown a photo of a friend, and sure
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough, the pal did not register any big spikes of activity.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no significant differences between men and women in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the experiment though the ladies were far more eager to participate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the gents.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two doctors placed ads and distributed posters to recruit
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their volunteers, who were required to be &quot;head over heels in love.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were &quot;inundated&quot; by women, and eventually chose 11 women and six
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men as test subjects.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers, who also have studied the workings of artistic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brains, presented their findings at a meeting of neurobiologists. They
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may have interesting plans for their material, though.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm convinced that we can use it as a test for love,&quot; Dr.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartels said. &quot;However, it's rather an expensive one.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, love has fascinated a few other academes over the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 20 years ago, psychologist Elaine Hatfield queried the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young and restless at three universities to discover that most fretted
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their &quot;real&quot; love might be mere infatuation.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yale University researcher Robert Sternberg probed the very
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;psychology of love&quot; and came up with a half-dozen varieties of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience. Still another researcher found that people eased, rather
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than fell, into love, mostly because they were terrified of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prospect of admitting they cared.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical psychologists Carl Hundy and Susan Vonderheide,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meanwhile, have identified all sorts of alarming lovelorn states,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including &quot;romantic anxiety,&quot; &quot;insecure love&quot; and &quot;jealous obsession.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love is a veritable cottage industry in the pop-psychology
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world, which revolves around permutations of those who pursue or are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursued.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new English study, though, is the first to objectively chart
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the real effects of romance on the brain, through magnetic resonance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imaging in this case.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;These parts of the brain are also the parts which are active in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;euphoric states generated by exogenous substances such as cocaine,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noted research partner Dr. Zeki. &quot;Romantic love is to for many people,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at any rate, intoxicating.&quot;
