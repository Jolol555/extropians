<P>
I found it curious that Krugman wrote: &quot;Most important of all, the prophets 
<BR>
of an 'information economy' seem to have forgotten basic economics. When 
<BR>
something becomes abundant, it also becomes cheap. A world awash in 
<BR>
information will be a world in which information per se has very little 
<BR>
market value.&quot;  
<BR>
<P>I'm not economics expert, but isn't Krugman misstating &quot;basic economics&quot;?  
<BR>
After all, an increase in supply decreases price only if demand does not 
<BR>
increase commensurately.  I can think of a great many factors, however, that 
<BR>
will drive up the demand for information even as its supply increases.  
<BR>
Perhaps Krugman expects us to read in the standard caveat, &quot;all else being 
<BR>
equal.&quot;  But in this context, I think he needs to spell out--and defend--that 
<BR>
assumption.
<BR>
<P>Relatedly, mere data does not equal information.  Per Sturgeon's law, we 
<BR>
always have to sort the diamonds from the rough.  Query as to which camp 
<BR>
Krugman's essay falls in.  Data-sorting costs probably rise disproportionate 
<BR>
to the amount of data handled; certainly, I find I'm too busy to detail the 
<BR>
problems with Krugman's account of natural resources.  In brief, data may 
<BR>
increase, but so might the costs of finding, and the demand for, useful 
<BR>
information,
