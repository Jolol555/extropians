<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, present copyrights are being thrown out the window
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very quickly, and they took a long time to go into place. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, they've only existed for the last 3-400 years, and
<BR>
in their present form (protecting such things as photographs and
<BR>
recorded music) for less than a century.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They were made to protect.  Otherwise anyone who had more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources can basically screw you selling your idea and claiming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you never thought it up.
</EM><BR>
<P>One should be careful to separate the /justification/ for a law
<BR>
from the actual /purpose/ of the law, which are rarely the same.
<BR>
Legislators always have some benign-sounding purpose for laws
<BR>
that have some other intended purpose.  Laws against encryption
<BR>
technology claim to be about protecting national security and
<BR>
facilitating criminal investigation; they are obviously intended
<BR>
to make it easier for big brother to spy on the masses.  All the
<BR>
concealed carry laws that started passing in the south in the 20s
<BR>
were justified as ways to reduce crime--they're real purpose was
<BR>
to make it harder for uppity blacks to defend themselves against
<BR>
lynching.  The origin of copyright--the Statute of Anne--wasn't
<BR>
even vaguely justified as protecting artists.  It's purpose, even
<BR>
as stated, was simply to grant a monopoly to the privileged class,
<BR>
and its monopolies were granted to wealthy printers in exchange
<BR>
for support.  Later, the &quot;protecting authors&quot; justification was
<BR>
used when the intent was just to subsidize wealthy printers and
<BR>
publishers.
