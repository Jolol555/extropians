</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes. . . 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So physical capital for manufacturing gets ~ 3.5%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of income.  So suddenly making that free, as nanotech might, is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; improvement equivalent to one year's economic growth.  Now if you could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make the labor and human capital of manufacturing cheaper, that would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a bigger deal.  And making labor and human capital of all industries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheaper, as from AI or uploading, that is a huge deal.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it makes uploading as an alternative to AI development look silly, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;nanotech is almost certainly an enabling technology for uploading, (since we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;can't reasonably expect to upload until we get reasonable disassemblers to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;work on our brains,) and AI is required for nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P>Jumping in here, has anyone really defined for certain what a useful
<BR>
&quot;AI&quot; would be, and how it would differ, exactly, from any other piece of
<BR>
software? Nano theorists and nano doubters alike seem to enjoy talking
<BR>
about AI's, but maybe all you really need is just some very fancy
<BR>
software to do the &quot;automated molecular skyscrapers&quot; from simple feed
<BR>
stock material. I know, I know, that's just typical nano-enthusiast
<BR>
commentary :^).
<BR>
Really, though, is there an implicit assumption that &quot;compiler&quot; software
<BR>
is at a standstill -- so therefore you need a &quot;Max Headroom&quot; AI before
<BR>
you can successfully automate some range of constructions?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree that you need advanced nanotech to upload.  It all depends on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just how detailed information you need on neurons and synapses.  And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could well be worth spending billions of dollars to scan just one brain,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given how much money could be made from copies of that one brain.   We didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need advanced nanotech to read the human genome -- because it was worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough to read just one genome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Er, wait a minute! You're going to get detailed info on about a
<BR>
quadrillion brain synapses, and you're going to do that without advanced
<BR>
nanotech? I believe that's roughly the number of synapses in the brain
<BR>
of any given individual whose mind you might wish to upload? Suddenly, I
<BR>
envisage the subject for this with a whole forest of chemical analysis
<BR>
pipettes sticking out of his skull (to say the least)! As you indicate,
<BR>
one might be able to skip *some* of that &quot;quadrillion synapses&quot;. But,
<BR>
even if you need, say &quot;only a trillion&quot; sensors, how do you do that with
<BR>
any ordinary tech?
