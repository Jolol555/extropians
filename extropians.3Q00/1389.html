<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;People can and do deny the obvious.  Something like 40% of Americans

<EM>&gt; &gt; believe

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the world was created in a big &quot;poof&quot; 6000 years ago.

<EM>&gt; &gt;Robin Hanson responds, effectively supporting the original comment, with:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Since I have the stat handy, in 1999 Gallup found that 47% in US believe God
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;created humans in basically their present form in the last 10,000 years or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This feels to me like the way bad information gets proliferated.  Robin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;refers to his factoid as &quot;the&quot; stat, giving the unwarranted impression that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Curt's &quot;poof&quot; creationism is on &quot;solidly corroborated&quot; ground.  But Robin's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;description of the Gallup information is only somewhat similar to Curt's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;big poof&quot; formulation, and the details of the questioning by Gallup which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;resulted in the &quot;47% believe&quot; factoid--those details are unavailable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Considering the general disrepute of polling statistcs, all we're offered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;here is mental pollution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here is my source:  <A HREF="http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr990830.asp">http://www.gallup.com/poll/releases/pr990830.asp</A>

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;The Gallup stats may simply reflect that people have heard of Neanderthals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and Cromagnons--pre-modern humans who lived, what?, 20, 50, 100,000 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;ago, that they generally believe that modern civilization and with it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;modern man, began about 10,000 years ago, and that the question &quot;Where did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it all came from?&quot; is answered conventionally with god.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The claim agreed to by 47% of US in 1999 is:  &quot;God created human beings pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so'
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly, while I find this issue to be of concern, looking at the full response
<BR>
(including responses in previous instances the poll was taken) shows that the
<BR>
numbers have not changed all that significantly since 1982, so while the level
<BR>
of willful ignorance is disturbing, its not like there has been any big increase
<BR>
in stupidity over time. People are as dumb as they have been in the past, see:
<BR>
<P>Which of the following statements comes closest to your views on the origin and
<BR>
development of human beings -- 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99 Aug   97 Nov      93 Jun     1982
<BR>
Human beings have developed
<BR>
over millions of years from
<BR>
less  advanced forms of life,
<BR>
but God guided this process.     40%     39%           35%     38% 
<BR>
Human beings have developed 
<BR>
over millions of years from
<BR>
lessadvanced forms of life. 
<BR>
God had no part in this process.   9     10            11       9 
<BR>
God created human beings 
<BR>
pretty much in their present 
<BR>
form at one time within the 
<BR>
last 10,000 years or so.          47      44            47      44 
<BR>
No opinion                         4       7            7        9 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100%    100%         100%     100%
<BR>
<P>The only significant change is that the people with no opinion have decreased,
<BR>
which can be considered a good thing, assuming that people are answering with an
<BR>
informed opinion, where a knee jerk opinion is as useless as no opinion.
