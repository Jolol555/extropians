<EM>&gt;  Maybe the moral is something like this:  let people develop and grow as 
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  will rather than trying to squash them into pre-packaged roles; life is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  dynamic--things that stay always the same are lifeless, so let change occur
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rather than trying to keep people and relationships always the same; when a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  relationship that has been good begins to be deteriorate and become 
</EM><BR>
stifling
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  for one or another of the parties, change it, or let it go; when a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  relationship must end, think of it as a lesson learned or as growth rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  than as a failure.  (these things are easy to say, but they don't seem to 
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  easy for people to put into practice)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How very true.  It's a shame that our hearts usually get in the way of 
<BR>
common sense like this.
