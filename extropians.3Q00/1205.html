<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Couldn't the millions of years of development work on
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;DNA and the rest of the body have created something that performs a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;more difficult job than screwing in rivets?
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly, but when a embryo gestates in the womb intelligence is not needed
<BR>
for its construction, no intelligence at all, not even a little. It's a good thing
<BR>
the construction parts aren't macroscopic or we wouldn't be here.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;But buildings are rather expensive also; beams are relatively cheap.
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you priced building materials lately? Let's just say they're not cheaper
<BR>
than atoms.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Why don't we just make robots build buildings
</EM><BR>
<P>The same reason evolution never came up with a way to build complex things
<BR>
out of macroscopic parts, or at least it didn't until it came up with humans.
<BR>
It's too hard to make things that way. I gave 6 reasons why.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Drexler, for example, imagines machine-phase assembly to look an awful
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; lot like macroscale assembly,
</EM><BR>
<P>There are similarities, the most obvious is that both are building something, but
<BR>
as I pointed out there are also important differences too.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;as far as the number of parts are concerned; rather than fill Nanosystems
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;with discussion of how pure carbon reacts and how we can use that to build
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;complex polymers one  monomer at a time, he fills his diamondoid chapter
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;with sketches of designs for levers, struts, bearings, rivets, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>The ultimate purpose of nearly all those machines is to manipulate bits of
<BR>
information or manipulate individual atoms, it will take complex machines to
<BR>
do that and if you want to build something macroscopic in a reasonable time
<BR>
you'll need an astronomical number of those complex Nanomachines. If you
<BR>
want to call that &quot;chunking&quot; that's fine with me but at the end of the day it all
<BR>
comes down to picking up an atom here and putting it over there.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;&gt;There is no way you can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Not true if you chunk the problem the way Drexler does; indeed, he
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; spends a lengthy section of the book dicussing just when and how his
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; bonds will break under stress.
</EM><BR>
<P>You can't damage atoms and of course bonds are not infinitely strong.
<BR>
I must be missing something.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; OK, suppose I have a set of beams for you that are identical enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; that slight discrepencies in shape or size are irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not irrelevant and it's not theoretical. In a real world car assembly line there is a
<BR>
huge amount of banging, warping, shoving, and finessing to get things to line up properly,
<BR>
it must be done carefully and intelligently or things will break, workers spend more time
<BR>
doing that then anything else. They need to do it an equal amount of fudging on the next
<BR>
car they work on too but not in exactly the same way because the parts are not exactly the
<BR>
same. The more parts you're using the more variations in part size add up and cause
<BR>
trouble. If it wasn't for this we'd have had totally automated car factories in the 1950's.
<BR>
Record the position the robot hand should to in at during every instant of assembly and
<BR>
just replay it for the next car; it would never work.  No cookbook smaller than the galaxy
<BR>
could contain all the &quot;if then&quot; rules needed, to get the job done you need a brain.
<BR>
However we know for a fact that a compact cookbook exists to make something far more
<BR>
complex than a car and it works every time, DNA. The fundamental difference between a
<BR>
car factory and a womb is the size of the building blocks.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Organic chemistry is substantially more complicated than Lego blocks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;even in the machine phase.
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted it's not quite as easy as playing with Legos but it's much simpler than
<BR>
most macroscopic object and the countless ways they can interact, like the way
<BR>
a turbine blade interacts with a jet engine. There are fewer possibilities with atoms,
<BR>
I might get H2O or H2O2 but H3O is unlikely.
<BR>
<P>Even more important, chemistry is repeatable. If I overstress a jet engine it will fail
<BR>
at some point but no two will ever fail in the same way at the same time. The weather
<BR>
it flies through will never be the same either because some butterfly in Brazil decided
<BR>
to flap its wings two years ago. In contrast, although the process is astronomically
<BR>
complex, a protein folds up into exactly the same intricate shape every time over a
<BR>
large range of temperature and pH found in biological systems. I can't think of anything
<BR>
made of macroscopic blocks that robust.
