<EM> &gt; with first external but more and more integrated and then internal

<EM> &gt; hardware and software.  This seems to me the best way to keep humans in
</EM><BR>
<P>This method is
<BR>
<P>* slow
<BR>
<P>* technically demanding (biocompatibility; probably requires nanotechnology)
<BR>
<P>* has high ethical threshold and is risky (neurosurgery is no peanuts)
<BR>
<P>* attempts to integrate two very different paradigms: neuro and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;digital, which requires a very good understanding of the wet substrate
<BR>
<P>It would work in principle, provided in the meantime no AI grown by
<BR>
evolutionary algorithms emerges. (This is unlikely, because in 20-30
<BR>
years we should have molecular circuitry, and hence enough computing
<BR>
performance to breed an AI from scratch, while augmentation will have
<BR>
made scarcely any headway in that time frame). Because of explosive
<BR>
kinetics of the self-enhancing positive autofeedback process of the
<BR>
AI, the cyborg wannabees would be just as left in the dust as
<BR>
unaugmented people.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; the loop and to end up with something human compatible and reasonably
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; likely to be friendly and caring about humanity.  
</EM><BR>

<BR>
Assuming, the transition will be indeed so slow. Convergent evolution
<BR>
would seem to require that ALife AI and uploaders would be
<BR>
undistinguishable. Because uploaders would be probably slower to
<BR>
converge initially due to evolutionary ballast, this probably means
<BR>
that they will be blown away by ALife AI, if latter emerges at
<BR>
relatively early step of the game.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; But what a great resources to hook into the WebMind or to have at the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; disposal of more capable AI!  Don't throw that work out.  It is a useful
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; piece.  If nothing else it is a huge glob of training material.  
</EM><BR>
<P>A search engine with Cyc functionality is indeed very useful, but only
<BR>
as long as we can't create real AI. It *is* a useful piece, as it
<BR>
demonstrates another failure of a given approach.
