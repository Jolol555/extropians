...Well, with aminoguanidine it may be never; Cerami et al fairly
<BR>
conclusively showed it worked in rats and that was '80's.
<BR>
<P>The chemical has been around for quite a while before that; and like
<BR>
piracetam; arginine pyroglutamate; and dextromethorphan (...in stroke and
<BR>
NOT as a trip!!...), I suppose there is little incentive for development as
<BR>
a commercial wonder drug... and no real hope of it being legally called a
<BR>
&quot;dietary supplement&quot; to be pushed by the vitamin hawkers.
<BR>
<P>I'd love to know about aminoguanidine's toxicology though. ...And did you
<BR>
see Robert-Coyote's post about that dipeptide carnosine?...that probably
<BR>
isn't toxic, and if you can't buy it you should be able to make it.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;If you read the article, they say it will be &quot;at least&quot; 10 years before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;AGE-breakers are approved for use in humans. That can't be right, can it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Would it be possible to take aminoguanidine with meals to reduce AGE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;formation? How much would you take?

<EM>&gt;&gt; There's an article in the current (July) Scientific American which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; presents an entirely different mechanism for age-related damage,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; glycation of tissue proteins.  At a minimum it seems there is much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; more to aging than DNA damage...
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    Anthony Cerami of the Kenneth S. Warren Laboratories in Tarrytown,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    N.Y., suspected some 30 years ago that sugar affects how the body
</EM><BR>
ages,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    based on observations of diabetics, who age rapidly. Sugars are an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    essential source of energy, but once in circulation they can act as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    molecular glue, attaching themselves to the amino groups in tissue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    proteins and cross-linking them into hard yellow-brown compounds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    known as advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    Indeed, after years of bread, noodles and cakes, human tissues
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    inevitably become rigid and yellow with pigmented AGE deposits. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    the most part, piling on dark pigments in the teeth, bones and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    skin is harmless.  But where glucose forms tight bonds with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    long-lived protein collagen, the result is a constellation of changes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    including thickened arteries, stiff joints, feeble muscles and failing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    organs--the hallmarks of a frail old age.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    Cerami's team showed in the mid-1980s that aminoguanidine could keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    the tissues of diabetic rats and other old animals as elastic as those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    of young control subjects. It boosted their cardiovascular function
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    and improved other age-related disorders. Further studies showed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    that aminoguanidine lowered diabetics' urine albumin--an indicator
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    of kidney malfunction--and delayed AGE-related damage to the retina.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    A single fountain-of-youth elixir is highly unlikely, says Tamara
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    Harris of the National Institute on Aging, because other activities,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    such as free-radical oxidation and possibly telomere shortening,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    also contribute to the body's slow decline. Moreover, AGE-related
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    research tends to be slow: Harris points out that there is no easy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    well-validated way to measure AGE in the body, a shortcoming that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    complicates trials. To Harris, however, AGE breakers remain an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    appealing option. &quot;This is a nice approach because it is multifocal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    aimed at a basic process that occurs in multiple systems. But,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;    she warns, &quot;there won't be one silver bullet.&quot;
