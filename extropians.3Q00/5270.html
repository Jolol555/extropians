<P>Urp. Monroe was a loon who thought he could project his mind outside his
<BR>
body into all manner of wondrous parallel worlds. The bit he left out of
<BR>
his first very pop-successful book was that he'd started this after
<BR>
sniffing some interesting volatiles. La la.
<BR>
<P>McMoneagle, cited at the end, works some of the time at the Monroe
<BR>
Institute, and is the most notable of the former CIA remote viewers. I
<BR>
don't know if his claims in that regard are kosher or not; most people here
<BR>
regard them (without investigation) as simply out of court, but I find some
<BR>
reason to take his reports seriously (where conducted under scientific
<BR>
scrutiny, as the intelligence/military work was, and more recent stuff done
<BR>
with Dr Ed May and others).
<BR>
<P>Hypnagogic experiences don't have anything at all to do with either of
<BR>
these purported phenomena, though.
