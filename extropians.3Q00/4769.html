<EM>&gt; {8^D  I have heard rumors that Bill's Bloatware is planning to release

<EM>&gt; an industrial strength version of excel that has a capacity of a megaline.

<EM>&gt; Anyone else heard of that?  spike

<P>Geez Spike, what is it with excel &amp; engineers? Some years back I used to
<BR>
work in a company with lots of engineers, supporting small systems.
<BR>
Engineers, I discovered, love excel. At some point, the really keen ones
<BR>
discover Excel macros, and build systems, which grow until they become both
<BR>
mission critical and entirely broken. That was a, ah, challenging job.
<BR>
<P>Actually I fully supported the approach. After all, if they didn't build
<BR>
such systems, then they were stuck with pen and paper; the IT division had
<BR>
higher falutin concerns than building solutions for their clients. At least
<BR>
if they built something broken, then something existed which had to be
<BR>
supported, and eventually replaced, which meant they eventually got what
<BR>
they needed.
<BR>
<P>I don't know anything about a megaline excel, but I bet there are millions
<BR>
of engineers the world over, drooling in anticipation.
<BR>
<P>Truly Spike, I say unto ye, venture into the world of MSAccess. You'll be
<BR>
surprised; contrary to the hype, it's actually a really useful tool for
<BR>
storing/manipulating large amounts of data. Just don't try to build
<BR>
multiuser systems out of it.
