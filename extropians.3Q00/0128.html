I think the primary goal is to be happy - having more money is going to be a huge factor in that, possibly the most important, and certainly the second or third. The simple reason is that you need money to get many of the things which make you happy.

<BR>
<P>Thank you for saying such an obvious thing!!  I am tired of hearing how money is not a very important part of the happiness equation! And is not really necessary beyond keeping one fed and with basic shelter!  I recommend a book to you all called &quot;Warm Hearts, Cold Cash.&quot;  It really shows the relationship between &quot;love&quot; and finances.  
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
For example, without a computer and full internet
<BR>
access, the happiness in my life would be cut in half, at least. I need money to be able to afford a computer and internet access.

You, I assume, would not be happy writing a book on &quot;quantum astrology&quot;. I could make more money by selling meth, prostituting myself, or robbing people, but I would be unhappy doing so, and I have a personal rule that I would only work in an office which required me to wear a tie for at least 20% more money. Material rewards are extremely important, but nobody is saying they are the only kind.

They must rationally figure out how to attain goals which would make them happy, and then to actually ACT on the results, then they would have more money and more happiness. The simplest thing to do would be to move to someplace with lower rent.

<P>Another answer is to get a new job. Find out what you want to do, find out what skills you need to do that, and attain those skills. Anyone, with rare
<BR>
exception, is capable of doing this.&gt;

<P>This advice is more for someone like me and not so much a migrant from the third-world with a family to support and a very limited education.  
<BR>
<P>I am great at thinking about things, analyzing the situation, but I either come to a complete loss on what to do about things(such as my career path), or I come up with lengthy written plans about a goal which I never actually do.  
<BR>
<P>My mother recently counselled me to make a decision(regarding a romantic relationship) and than ACT.  She said I tend to stumble over my feet and not take action in life.  I suppose I must sometimes make a decisive decision and live with the consequences.

The people doing them already have other options of finding quite more then basic subsistence, as you have. They are just not taking them. Why is this?

<P>I think they are limited by a lack of money and also confidence in themselves to do much better than they already are.  A few of the brightest and most ambitious(a connection there?) will move up in life.

I'm not sure what you're saying - are migrants incapable of improving themselves in the way you or I have? Do you not see this as condescending? &quot;no - you don't understand what kinds of people they are&quot;. And I don't understand how sacrificing for their children would make it neccesary to move to someplace with high rent.  
<BR>
<P>There's a catch-22 - is it possible for someone to be implicitly superior to anyone else, via genetics or whatever? I believe that, no it is not. In rare cases, such as mental retardation, someone is at a natural disadvantage, but the fact that some retarded people are able to get jobs and make a decent
<BR>
living shows that the disadvantage is not as pronounced as you would think.  
<BR>
<P>And if I am wrong, and it is possible that anyone is superior to anyone else, then you would expect and want it to be reflected in differences in income.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>And it is!!  I am not as smart as the doctor I sometimes visit, and believe me, he makes more money than I do!  There are obviously gradations of intelligence among humans and so not everyone can be an engineer, professor or programmer.  
<BR>
<P>I come from a family of engineers on my father's side and pharmacists, professors and m.d.'s on my mothers.  I may carry some good genes but I did not get them for myself!  Higher mathematics and science are severely troubling for me.  I would love to be able to go into a field where I could be sure of a good income.
<BR>
<P>My former state of Alaska voc rehab counselor, a very &quot;compassionate&quot; person said no moderate to severe learning disabled person had ever in her &quot;care&quot; gotten an undergraduate degree or gone to grad school.  And she said that even if they were to graduate with a master's, they would not be able to hack it in the professional world.  I found her attitude of &quot;it may be a bad investment to try&quot; rather sickening.  
<BR>
<P>I wound up not getting picked up by the program.  My college grades were not the B average she wanted, but that was more due to laziness, clinical depression and disorganization than my combination of learning disabilities.  Also she wanted my major to be &quot;written in stone&quot; and that bothered me since I don't know exactly what I want to do yet.  I had thought teaching but I hear so many negative things about it.

access to computers and programming classes and zero difficulty in visualizing a computer's operation

(I TA'ed one such class ;) the students clearly varied from completely not needing me to being completely clue-proof.  And it looked like they were trying, not that we were experienced teachers or anything)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Any teacher would realize the gradations of intellect among us.  Some are simply more intelligent, while even for some bright ones, it just takes a lot longer to learn the task at hand.
<BR>
<P>he continues:
<BR>
followed by Caltech and Silicon Valley, with jobs and high salaries dropping into my lap. Vs. someone born in a Third World village, no running water or modern
<BR>
medicine, minimal books or electricity, not surrounded by a literate and industrial society so that the values of such can seep into their soul through
<BR>
osmosis... yet they move to a foreign country, without money or the language (but probably with knowing previous migrants in the area), working as long or
<BR>
longer hours than the most dedicated IPO hunter, at more physically taxing and mind-numbing work.
<BR>
Improve themselves?  Far more so than I have.  But from so far behind... their children might catch up, some of them.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Their brightest and most ambitious children only would probably catch up.  I think there is a middle ground here in the sense that phoenix and Damien have a very realistic take on the situation immigrants(and other people) find themselves in, and yet Brian is right in saying, &quot;hey, if they REALLY want to, they can change or at least try to!&quot;

<BR>
<P>Exactly!  Being learning disabled made my public education days hard.  I was diagnosed in the second grade and went through the slingerland program.  I had a horrible time memorizing the multiplication tables(I did, but it took forever) and my rote memory is still weak.  I remember being in classes and just not &quot;getting it&quot; in math, english or science.  I loved social studies, creative reading and writing classes, and anything taught by a certain science teacher.

How'd we start this, anyway?  Oh, right: Bonnie said people work harder in
<BR>
proportion to financial reward, and Damien B. pointed out that the migrants

are working harder for less ultimate reward than, say, me.  And they're
<BR>
grateful for the opportunity, compared to back home.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I have Filipino friends who tell me they can support whole extended families back home with just part of their paycheck.  They miss home but love the buying power of the dollar.  
<BR>
<P>phoenix continues:
<BR>
Hell.  People like me don't even 'work', ideally.  Yeah, we want money for
<BR>
creature comforts and toys.  But after that work should be intellectual play,
<BR>
or at least a mixture of that and hired labor for someone else.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Work as intellectual play?  That must be a nice way to make a living!  I sometimes have a problem with the saying that white collar workers don't actually WORK for a living!  I would think the stresses would be more mental and simply less physical.  I could see how white collar work could actually be more stressful.  But the autonomy one tends to get in at least some white collar work must be nice.

<EM>&gt; Move to somewhere with a lower rent. In the Valley. I love it. They're

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's perhaps easier to think this through by looking at the area's school

<EM>&gt; teachers. They don't get paid enough to rent decent houses in such an

Yes exactly. They get what they settle for. Simple as that. No whining allowed. If you ain't happy then do something to make yourself happy or don't. I don't care. I can tell you this- if the teachers all moved out of the valley the people there would have no trouble raising the $$$ required to start up their own private schools. Who gives a #### about public schools anyway? I'm sorry but If you ain't happy then do something to make yourself happy or don't.

<BR>
<P>I need to have this put in large print and framed on my wall at home!  I have so many problems in my life but don't move my feet.  
<BR>
<P>My problems so far...
<BR>
1.  Clinical depression and I suspect a.d.d.
<BR>
2.  Unsure of type of education and career to pursue
<BR>
3.  Conflict of lifestyles/paradigms because of my religion(mormon) and transhumanist/cryonicist memes.  A part of me wants to reject one over the other, but I feel I can't do this.  I need my faith, but I need this list also.  The desire is still strong in me for finding a mate of my faith, but real conflict could arise.  &quot;Hey honey, ever hear about cryonics?&quot; lol    
<BR>
4.  I have talked about becoming muscular and fit for years, but have yet to do it.    
<BR>
5.  I realize the importance of keeping a journal but simply don't out of tiredness, laziness, etc.    
<BR>
6.  I am terribly disorganized.  I store half my stuff in boxes and garbage bags!  I have lost so many wonderful emails too.
<BR>
7.  I don't have a driver's license and suspect I may never get one.  My learning disabilities are such(bad sense of direction, traffic flow and rules sometimes confuse me) that it may be beyond me.  I feel inadequate in terms of work and dating due to this.  Anchorage is a car city with a barely adequate bus system.  Riding a bike in winter is not a smart idea to say the least.  I want to stay in Alaska I suppose to continue getting my annual dividend checks.  
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I have found this a fascinating thread.  Many of you are so fortunate to have been blessed with in at least some cases, good parents, or at least good genes which enable you to learn and master the difficult subjects which lead to success in our modern world.  I feel honored to read and learn from you each day.  
<BR>
<P>I think I am finally getting to a place where I want to move forward and change some things in my life.  I think trying out Deseryl will be phase one.  I look forward to any advice any of you may have for me.
