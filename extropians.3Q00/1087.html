<P><EM>&gt; &gt;My only issue is with copyright: the idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that ideas are &quot;ownable&quot;.  I oppose that for ethical reasons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and I think humanity as a whole suffers from the shackles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;put on our collective minds by this restriction on the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;flow of information of all kinds.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A piece of music is not an Idea any more than car! It is a result of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; execution af an idea.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you make a piece of music and say that it is illegal to copy it, it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not stop other people from making music and it will not keep them from being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inspired by it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is not like some stupid and obvious software patent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Somebody makes popular music. Other people sell it. Those selling it makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the money. So there is no incentive to make more good music.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a market where there is no copyright there will be no survival of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fittest. I don't understand that you (totally)free market guys cannot see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is so fragemented and confused it hardly deserves reply, but I'll
<BR>
try anyway:
<BR>
<P>The music itself is a /pattern/, expressed in some medium, like
<BR>
a disk.  It is the /design/ of the car, not the car.  The disk is the
<BR>
car.  I'm all for selling disks and cars.  What copyright does is
<BR>
prevent me from selling a different disk or different car embodying
<BR>
the same patterns.  I can't sell an identical replica of my Subaru
<BR>
or a re-recording of an album, even if I use my own materials and
<BR>
labor to build them.
<BR>
<P>The naked, unsupported assertion that music sales will not support
<BR>
artists absent copyright won't become true no matter how many times
<BR>
you repeat it.  If this were true, broadcast television and radio
<BR>
would not exist at all, and yet they are billion dollar industries.
<BR>
I'm not surprized that I seem to be the only one in this debate
<BR>
who is using actual examples and actual numbers.  Continually
<BR>
repeating unbacked opinions is a poor substitute for real philosophy.
<BR>
<P>I am a 100% free-market capitalist.  I hold no higher moral value
<BR>
than earning profit in the free market.  But &quot;free market&quot; is open
<BR>
to varying definitions.  Yours (and that of the existing system)
<BR>
includes the idea of government-backed protection of the market
<BR>
in information-based goods and services.  Mine does not.  To me,
<BR>
a free market is one where every player is able to make use of eir
<BR>
own knowledge and talents however ey sees fit, short of force or
<BR>
fraud.  Re-selling information works is neither force nor fraud;
<BR>
it is only &quot;theft&quot; because the law defines it as such, and it is
<BR>
that definition we are debating, so you can't make it a premise.
<BR>
<P>Freedom should be the default premise.  It is those who want to
<BR>
use government guns to protect the markets of publishers who must
<BR>
come up with /compelling/ reasons to justify it.  &quot;We make more
<BR>
money that way&quot; is not a compelling reason.
