<P>&lt;&lt; Frank Tipler has never been my personal transhumanist Guru. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Immortality is not just about physics, although his ideas are
<BR>
&nbsp;certainly worth reading and learning about. Placing too much
<BR>
&nbsp;emphasis on technology and not enough emphasis on cultural change
<BR>
&nbsp;may paint us into a corner. I think it would be far reaching
<BR>
&nbsp;to develop the skills to implement change to get us to the future.

My own personal ambitions lead me away from the political-cultural since both 
<BR>
can be fraught with ideological danger. If we can provide some concepts that 
<BR>
are appealing to both the scientist and nonscientist; the religious and the 
<BR>
atheist, then you have, indeed, changed society without being consumed by 
<BR>
ideology. People can adapt their own world-views to meet a new and 
<BR>
spectacular set of facts, such as the Final Anthropic Principle (assuming 
<BR>
that it is correct) and it will change every society that learns of it. There 
<BR>
are two major contenders (so far) to Barrow and Tipler's theory. One is by 
<BR>
Hans Moravec and his Neutronium Computers, the other is by Max Tegmark and 
<BR>
his Universe Ensemble. There shall surely be others. We need technology, 
<BR>
otherwise it will be misunderstood as a &quot;new ager&quot; fantasy.
