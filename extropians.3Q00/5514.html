<EM>&gt; &gt; Frankly I have had enough friends raped, mugged and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had a second level friend beaten to death. Like most of us I tend not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dwell on these things too much.  But I can't help but wonder if one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; friend would still be alive and if the others would have been a lot less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; traumatized if they were armed.  The issues aren't all academic or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matter of 2nd amendment justifying of not justifying it.  These things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are also a matter of life and death of real people, some of them quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; close to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To carry a lethal weapon, as others have pointed out, means adjusting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your thought processes to the point where you are prepared to exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lethal force.  You have to be ready to kill, if you carry a gun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And for it to be useful in the examples cited, you have to be ready to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kill in response to an assault of less than lethal magnitude.  You need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be ready to kill in response to robbery, for example.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hal, thats clearly false, since she did say one person was beaten to death,
<BR>
and given the statistics of risk of being killed during a rape, robbery, etc,
<BR>
there is a significant probability of deadly harm in such events, and given
<BR>
that its been proven that you are at least 30% more likely to survive such a
<BR>
crime if you are armed with a gun, then not carrying one is simply stupid. The
<BR>
law is that if you simply beleive you are in mortal danger, you can use deadly
<BR>
force. It also is that if dependent people, like children or handicapped, or
<BR>
elderly people are there, you are actually responsible to attempt to stop a
<BR>
felony, and deadly force is authorized if the felon is using any weapon that
<BR>
can kill.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think most people are ready to kill.  I don't think they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prepared to personally take a human life.  From what I've read, for most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people (not all) this is a tremendously traumatic experience.  To kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a human being carries the ultimate degree of finality.  You take away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything he will ever have and will ever be.  There is no chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reconciliation, no chance of recovery, no chance of reparing the damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has been done and beginning to start anew.  It's over, permanently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and forever.
</EM><BR>
<P>You want to reconcile with someone who wants to kill you? Excuse me? Anyone
<BR>
who would initiate deadly force has already given up their right to live, so
<BR>
you are not taking anything away from them. Its THEIR fault, not yours. If a
<BR>
person is killed for comitting a violent felony, such a homicide is more like
<BR>
a suicide than a manslaughter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me that preparing yourself psychologically for this action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires a certain amount of distancing and depersonalizing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attitudes towards other people.  You can't think of your target as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human being with hopes and aspirations, struggling under the weight of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damaging experiences and harmful thoughts.  He needs to be thought of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impersonally, as a threat to be eliminated.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you can empathize with them, you can understand them, but when it comes
<BR>
down to it, that does not take away from the fact they need to die, otherwise,
<BR>
you are going to die. They are sick people that cannot be reasoned with,
<BR>
cannot be reconciled with, who have no pity, no mercy, no compassion. If they
<BR>
don't value your life, then they obviously don't value their own.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impersonal and hard-hearted?  Might they not face a burden in setting up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alliances and working together with other people, compared to those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are more trusting, open and accepting of human limitations and weaknesses?
</EM><BR>
<P>Murderers are more cold blooded, more impersonal and hard hearted. Killing a
<BR>
murderer is the duty of any freedom loving person, whether on a one to one
<BR>
basis or as a society through the justice system. People who are 'trusting,
<BR>
open, and accepting of the human limitations and weaknesses' of murderers are
<BR>
no longer people (as far as the murderer is concerned, they are just prey, and
<BR>
then they are dead. A free society cannot tolerate the existence of those who
<BR>
would prey upon the liberty of other individuals and the trust free men have
<BR>
other freedom lovers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Taking the responsibility of carrying a gun is going to change you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It forces you to think of yourself as a killer, as one who is willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to kill.  Admittedly, if you actually save your life by carrying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun then any costs it imposes are worthwhile.  But the chance that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will actually be killed by violence are highly remote.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is nothing wrong with being a killer. Being a murderer is something else
<BR>
entirely, something distinctly different. Much like the difference between
<BR>
giving and taking, the difference between killing and murdering is frequently
<BR>
confused by those of casual moral development.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Given the very small probability of this outcome, the costs in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of your alienation from society must be considered significant.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long run your survival prospects will be hurt by having a lesser degree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of social connectivity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bull. A person who is willing to kill for the protection of their fellow man
<BR>
or themselves values liberty far greater than those sheeple who do not think
<BR>
life is worth fighting for.
