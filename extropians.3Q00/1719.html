<P><P><P>British and German scientists believe they have identified a specific area of 
<BR>
the human brain which appears to be responsible for intelligence. 
<BR>
The research - published in Science magazine - found that a part of the brain 
<BR>
called the frontal lateral cortex was the only area where blood flow 
<BR>
increased when volunteers tackled complicated puzzles involving sequences of 
<BR>
symbols and letters. 
<BR>
<P>Their findings seem to support the 1904 theory of psychologist Charles 
<BR>
Spearman, who argued that people used a particular part of the brain when 
<BR>
performing complex tasks. 
<BR>
<P>Other theories contend that intelligent thinking requires various portions of 
<BR>
the brain working together like different parts of an engine. 
<BR>
<P><P><P>The results suggest that &quot;general intelligence&quot; derives from a specific 
<BR>
frontal system
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Researchers' report  
<BR>
<P>The researchers, from the Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain 
<BR>
Sciences Unit at Cambridge University and from Dusseldorf University, used 
<BR>
scanning techniques to assess the blood flow in subjects' brains when they 
<BR>
were performing the tests. 
<BR>
<P>Science magazine also carries an article attacking the scientists' approach 
<BR>
to the subject. It argues that human intelligence cannot be defined in such a 
<BR>
specific way. 
<BR>
<P>'G-factor' 
<BR>
<P>The debate over the nature of intelligence has continued since Charles 
<BR>
Spearman set his mind to the problem early in the last century. 
<BR>
<P>He proposed that the same bright people tended to do well at different tasks 
<BR>
because they employed a generally useful component of their brains which he 
<BR>
called the &quot;g&quot; factor. 
<BR>
<P>However, many questions about the mystery of intelligence remain unanswered. 
<BR>
<P>The research, led by John Duncan from the MRC, asked volunteers to carry out 
<BR>
a number of &quot;high-g&quot; and &quot;low-g&quot; tasks which involved identifying mismatched 
<BR>
symbols or sets of letters. 
<BR>
<P>High-g tests were designed to employ a wider range of cognitive functions and 
<BR>
be more challenging than low-g tests. 
<BR>
<P>Brain scans 
<BR>
<P>While taking the tests, the volunteers' brains were scanned using a technique 
<BR>
called positron emission tomography. 
<BR>
<P>The scientists found that high-g tasks did not require numerous regions 
<BR>
spread around the brain to be used together. 
<BR>
<P>Instead, activity was concentrated in the lateral frontal cortex, in one or 
<BR>
both brain hemispheres. 
<BR>
<P>The researchers wrote: &quot;The results suggest that &quot;general intelligence&quot; 
<BR>
derives from a specific frontal system important in the control of diverse 
<BR>
forms of behaviour.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>But they acknowledged that this apparent intelligence centre might itself be 
<BR>
divided into finer components.
