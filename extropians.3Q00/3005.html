The more you know... the less the world knows.
<BR>
As you become smart you see the world become stupid.
<BR>
I don't trust the public to do anything...
<BR>
but die like they believe they will.
<BR>
I can't wait to get off this rock before some idiot kills us all.
<BR>
That way they keep their freedom,
<BR>
but I'm not dying in the process of granting it.
<BR>
People have helped me so little in my life
<BR>
I'm curious as to why I'm even writing this.
<BR>
oh yea, now I remember.
<BR>
<P>Without extropians the world's only chance of survival is luck. :-)
