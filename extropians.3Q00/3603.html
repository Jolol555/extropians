<EM>&gt; ...a variety of critics have declared that trials are rife with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conflicts of interest, that the analysis of women is inadequate, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; study results can be all but useless because so many patients lie when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim to have followed instructions...
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats only half the problem.  The other half of the problem is
<BR>
that the patients unintentionally forget the instructions.  The
<BR>
third half of the problem is that patients dont really *know*
<BR>
when they are doing something wrong or stupid, and the
<BR>
more stupid the patient the more likely something goes wrong.
<BR>
<P>A couple years ago, I suggested developing a device of
<BR>
some sort which would accurately measure all the inputs
<BR>
into the body, and measure the results in some objective
<BR>
fashion which is not dependent upon the unreliable
<BR>
verbal communication channel.  Of course, some serious
<BR>
info-nudists are required to make this happen.
<BR>
<P>The first step I have heard of in this direction is dna.com,
<BR>
whereby the volunteer fills in a questionaire about your
<BR>
medical history, then they set up an appointment, come
<BR>
to your home, draw some blood, analyse the DNA,
<BR>
and if enough volunteers step forward, a big picture
<BR>
will begin to emerge.  Of course I volunteered, and
<BR>
they are coming in a couple weeks for the blood.
<BR>
<P>If you wanna be part of that, goto www.dna.com.  spike
