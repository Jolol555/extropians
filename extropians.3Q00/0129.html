<EM>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Here's one for the testosterone fueled... Of you guys that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  guns, how many of you have ever had to use them in any kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-defense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  situation?
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't respond to this before, because I figured I'm not testosterone
<BR>
fueled, but it might be useful to have some info from someone who's not
<BR>
built like a wookie.
<BR>
<P>I've almost always been able to get myself out of harm's way before
<BR>
potentially dangerous situations got really critical.  There have only been
<BR>
2 times in my life that I felt badly threatened.  The first happened at
<BR>
around 3:00 p.m. across the street from the University of Texas School of
<BR>
Law--broad daylight and not a dangerous neighborhood.  I was cutting through
<BR>
a park to get to my car, and a guy was hiding in some bushes I walked past.
<BR>
He grabbed me around the neck and started choking me, pulling me off balance
<BR>
so that it would have been hard to get to a gun.  Possibly if the gun had
<BR>
been in a handy location and if I'd spent enough time practicing with it
<BR>
that I could have gotten the safety off and fired without even thinking
<BR>
about it, a gun would have helped me out. (I know people are going to wonder
<BR>
what happened in this situation, so here's the way it went:  the guy was a
<BR>
whole lot bigger than I was and trying to drag me down into a creek bed, but
<BR>
I grabbed hold of a tree trunk that was of a small enough diameter that I
<BR>
could get my hands around it, and I held on tightly.  He left off choking me
<BR>
to try to pry my hands loose, and once he stopped choking me I could talk--I
<BR>
couldn't talk while he was choking me.  So I said the first thing that
<BR>
popped into my head: &quot;Listen, before we go any farther with this, there's
<BR>
something you need to know.&quot;  He said, &quot;Huh?&quot; and stopped trying to pry my
<BR>
hands loose.  &quot;I have Parkinson's disease,&quot; I said very gravely.  He moved
<BR>
away from me and bent down to pick up my purse which he held out to me.
<BR>
&quot;You dropped your purse,&quot; he said.  Weird, huh?  I never have been able to
<BR>
figure that one out.  Maybe he felt sorry for me for having Parkinson's
<BR>
disease.)
<BR>
<P>The second time I felt really threatened was when the guys in the black
<BR>
helicopter paid me a visit along with a bunch of their buddies on the
<BR>
ground.  This was a Ruby Ridge scenario.  They claimed that from the air a
<BR>
couple of Vitex trees I had growing in my garden looked like marijuana.
<BR>
These guys were very well armed.  If I'd had a gun in my hands, I have no
<BR>
doubt whatsoever that I'd be dead now.  The guy who appeared to be the
<BR>
leader was very nervous; he seemed to think that I had a cult of followers
<BR>
secreted in my house or something and that he might never leave my place
<BR>
alive.  I talked soothingly to him to calm him down and after a while he
<BR>
lowered his gun.  I don't much like to tell this story, because some people
<BR>
think I was a coward for not either a. fighting and &quot;taking out&quot; as many as
<BR>
I could before I went down (and at an abstract level, I think they're at
<BR>
least partly right [except that my daughter and her friend were here--what a
<BR>
dreadful choice to have to make, between being a coward or leaving my
<BR>
daughter motherless--or maybe dead in case they just started shooting
<BR>
wildly--they seemed very nervous, so they might have done that]if more
<BR>
people would fight this sort of thing, maybe it wouldn't keep happening); or
<BR>
b. suing the federal government for sending men onto my land. Maybe I should
<BR>
have done more research on the latter option.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;They said they had the right to come onto my land without a search warrant
<BR>
because they had probable cause to think that illegal activities were going
<BR>
on here due to the Vitex trees, which, as I said, they mistook for marijuana
<BR>
plants. The way I viewed it at the time was that I wouldn't get far by suing
<BR>
them--others had tried it and failed to get anywhere.  I hadn't suffered any
<BR>
real damages--in fact, they helped me out by cutting back a root that was
<BR>
blocking a gate.  I don't know, though. It's still something that bothers
<BR>
me.  I remember once seeing a man being taken into the federal courthouse in
<BR>
handcuffs and thinking, &quot;Oh, there's a criminal, a bad guy,&quot; and then
<BR>
suddenly realizing that odds were he wasn't a bad guy at all, that he'd
<BR>
probably done something I wouldn't consider a crime at all. That, in fact,
<BR>
the bad guys were the ones wearing the guns and driving the car.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From time to time I hear of people being tortured in prison here is the US,
</EM><BR>
and I wonder:  truly, how far have things gone?  I know Germans who were
<BR>
alive during the 1930's and early 40's who had no idea of what was going on
<BR>
behind the barbed wire fences.  Maybe, yeah, they looked the other way some,
<BR>
but how do I know I'm not doing that right now?
<BR>
<P>I hear of political atrocities in other countries supported by US dollars.
<BR>
And I look the other way and say, &quot;Well, there's nothing I can do about it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>What IS to be done?  It seems as though, once you pass a certain point, the
<BR>
path is more or less fixed.  It will be traveled.  And the observers' only
<BR>
choice is to stand there and hope they don't get mowed down; or to leave.
<BR>
So many times people have ended up being trapped because they were afraid to
<BR>
leave the comforts of home, even when they saw bad things coming down the
<BR>
pike.  &quot;It can't happen here.  It won't happen to me,&quot; and all that.
<BR>
<P>Am I safe because I'm a nobody, a poor person living on trash land that no
<BR>
one else wanted?  I don't know.  When is the time to stand and fight, and
<BR>
when is the time to say, &quot;Count me out of this game&quot; ?  Am I paranoid
<BR>
because of my bad experience? I hear of this sort of thing happening
<BR>
everywhere, but maybe I exaggerate the problem in my mind.
<BR>
<P>On a brighter note, as far as regular old protection goes, dogs are great.
<BR>
