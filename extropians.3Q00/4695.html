From: Barbara Lamar &lt;<A HREF="mailto:shabrika@juno.com?Subject=Re:%20BIOTECH:%20Nobel%20Prize%20for%20food%20for%20Miracle%20Maize&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009111516.IAA10613@well.com&gt;">shabrika@juno.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd like to hope that research would move in this direction; but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at least in my part of the world,  the majority of the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't  seem to care much about the quality of their food.  I live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a rural area where almost everyone has garden space, and yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most people don't even keep small vegetable gardens. 
</EM><BR>
<P>At the start of the spring I gave bunches of seed packets (from
<BR>
seeds of change) to friends who like to garden. Now that it's fall
<BR>
I'm reaping the benefits in the form of delicious gifts of
<BR>
brandywine tomatoes, rainbow Inca sweet corn, sugar snap peas, and
<BR>
french breakfast radishes among others. I have a bunch of delighted
<BR>
friends, and &quot;Seeds Of Change&quot; has happy new customers. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; When fresh produce is made available to homeless people, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't want it--too much trouble to prepare it (this remains true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;even if kitchens are made available for their use). They'd rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eat out of cans.  Homeful people are often in too much of a rush
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to think of what they eat, spending long hours at work and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commuting and taking kids to extracurricular activities and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shopping and picking up the dry cleaning and doing housekeeping in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;odd moments.  They grab some takeout food or eat frozen dinners.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like a business opportunity for Barbara's homecooked
<BR>
microwavable Vegan specials.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;In neighboring Austin there is Whole Foods, which has now expanded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into a nationwide chain; and Central Market.  At both of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stores one can choose from a wide variety of fairly fresh
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vegetables; but the prices are outrageous.  The people who shop at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these stores make up only a tiny faction of the total population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the area.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, we have these here, they do good business.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;As one who grows heirloom corns such as Texas Honey June (sweet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corn) and Texas Gourdseed (good soft corn for tortillas), and my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own variety of field corn which I've bred especially for my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;climate and soil,  I readily agree with the New Mexican farmers'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wives about the taste and texture of the old varieties.  Until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enough people share that view to make it worth while for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;commercial seed companies to develop better tasting food crops,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the only solution seems to be for more people to grow gardens and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;preserve the old varieties, which are disappearing at an alarming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats why new seed companies are forming, like the good folks at
<BR>
&quot;Seeds Of Change&quot;. I live in a modest one bedroom apartment, but
<BR>
still grow fresh herbs on my window sills.
<BR>
<P>The need for very fresh produce to supply trendy restaurants has
<BR>
led to farms around the Chicago area that were vacant being turned
<BR>
into &quot;Market Gardens&quot; to supply these trendy restaurants.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Meanwhile, I'm glad to see research being done on at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;improving the nutritional value of food (although as I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mentioned before, I think there's a chance that some of the GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;foods are not metabolized properly).
</EM><BR>
<P>I would be hesitant to eat anything that kills insects. My friends
<BR>
who planted the seeds I gave them reported that these plants were
<BR>
quickly and eagerly consumed by pests if not protected.
