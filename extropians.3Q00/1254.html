<P>
Here's an interesting article about the environmental impact of human drugs 
<BR>
flushed into the environment after use (i.e. down the toilet). (from  
<BR>
&quot;RACHEL'S ENVIRONMENT &amp; HEALTH WEEKLY #702 &quot;):
<BR>
<P>Last December two scientists -- Christian G. Daughton and Thomas
<BR>
A. Ternes -- writing in ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES, a
<BR>
respected, peer-reviewed journal, pointed out the relationship
<BR>
between the human genome project and new drugs: &quot;The enormous
<BR>
array of pharmaceuticals will continue to diversify and grow as
<BR>
the human genome is mapped. Today there are about 500 distinct
<BR>
biochemical receptors at which drugs are targeted.... The number
<BR>
of targets is expected to increase 20-fold (yielding 3000 to
<BR>
10,000 drug targets) in the near future....&quot;[6] Daughton and
<BR>
Ternes go on to say, &quot;Escalating introduction to the marketplace
<BR>
of new pharmaceuticals is adding exponentially to the already
<BR>
large array of chemical classes, each with distinct modes of
<BR>
biochemical action, many of which are poorly understood.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Daughton and Ternes say that the quantity of pharmaceuticals and
<BR>
personal care products entering the environment each year is
<BR>
roughly comparable to the amounts of pesticides used each year.
<BR>
Huge quantities of prescription drugs and biologics, diagnostic
<BR>
agents, &quot;neutraceuticals,&quot; fragrances, sun-screen agents and
<BR>
numerous other classes of compounds enter the environment each
<BR>
year, without any government agencies taking notice. As daughton
<BR>
and Ternes point out, these chemicals tend to have several
<BR>
worrisome characteristics:
<BR>
<P>** Many are very long-lived, many break down into other
<BR>
long-lived compounds with their own peculiar chemical
<BR>
characteristics, and almost nothing is known about their movement
<BR>
in the environment;
<BR>
<P>** Pesticides tend to enter the environment in seasonal pulses.
<BR>
In contrast, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)
<BR>
enter the environment continuously via domestic and industrial
<BR>
sewage systems and via wet-weather runoff (for example, from
<BR>
confined animal feeding operations such as hog factories).
<BR>
<P>** Unlike many pesticides, most drugs and personal care products
<BR>
have not been examined for adverse environmental effects.
<BR>
Daughton and Ternes comment, &quot;This is surprising especially since
<BR>
certain pharmaceuticals are designed to modulate [change]
<BR>
endocrine and immune systems and cellular signal transduction and
<BR>
as such... have obvious potential as endocrine disruptors in the
<BR>
environment.&quot;[6,pg.908]
<BR>
<P>** Many of these chemicals are designed to have profound
<BR>
physiologic effects, so it would not be surprising if they were
<BR>
found to affect fish, shellfish, birds, worms, frogs, insects,
<BR>
and other forms of life.[6,pg.925]
<BR>
<P>** With pharmaceuticals, unpredicted and unknown side effects are
<BR>
often the norm: &quot;The possible actions and biochemical
<BR>
ramifications on nontarget aquatic biota are even less
<BR>
understood; many are totally unknown,&quot; Daughton and Ternes say.
<BR>
<P>** &quot;It is important to recognize that for many drugs, their
<BR>
specific modes of action even in the target species are also
<BR>
unknown. For these drugs, it is impossible to predict what
<BR>
effects they might have on non-target organisms.&quot; [6,pg.923]
<BR>
<P>** Most drugs don't cure illnesses, they control symptoms -- they
<BR>
lower cholesterol levels or blood pressure, or they alleviate
<BR>
pain or depression, or they revive limp libidoes. However, to
<BR>
achieve these results, they must be taken continuously, often for
<BR>
many years. Therefore, even relatively short-lived PPCPs can
<BR>
cause chronic exposures because they are continuously infused
<BR>
into the environment;
<BR>
<P>** Aquatic organisms are captives of their aquatic environment so
<BR>
must endure perpetual exposure;
<BR>
<P>** The bioaccumulation/bioconcentration potential for at least
<BR>
some PPCPs matches that of organochlorine compounds;[6,pg.910]
<BR>
<P>** Some PPCPs show &quot;very high acute aquatic toxicity&quot; while
<BR>
others &quot;can elicit constellations of significant but subtle
<BR>
effects across numerous species.&quot;[6,pg.910]
<BR>
<P>** It must also be recognized that even though individual
<BR>
concentrations of any drug might be low, the combined
<BR>
concentrations from drugs sharing a common mechanism of action
<BR>
could be substantial.&quot;[6,pg.925]
<BR>
<P>** Most chemical researchers don't have the tools needed to look
<BR>
for these chemicals in the environment. Researchers use gas
<BR>
chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The signals
<BR>
produced by such analytic equipment are compared to &quot;spectral
<BR>
libraries,&quot; allowing unknown chemicals to be identified. But the
<BR>
standard spectral libraries available from U.S. Environmental
<BR>
Protection Agency (EPA), the National Institute of Standards and
<BR>
Technology (NIST), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) do
<BR>
not include most pharmaceuticals. Therefore typical researchers
<BR>
are not prepared to identify pharmaceuticals in the environment.
<BR>
<P>** Daughton and Ternes list 66 classes of pharmaceuticals,
<BR>
including antidepressants; cancer chemotherapy drugs;
<BR>
tranquilizers and psychiatric drugs; pain killers of many kinds;
<BR>
anti-inflammatory drugs; many kinds of antihypertensives (blood
<BR>
pressure reducers); antiseptics; fungicides; anti-epileptics;
<BR>
bronchodilators (such as albuterol); many lipid regulators or
<BR>
anti-cholesterol agents; chemicals to increase the contrast in
<BR>
x-rays; muscle relaxants; anti-psychotic drugs; oral
<BR>
contraceptives; anorectics (diet pills); antibiotics; and
<BR>
synthetic hormones (estrogen and thyroid). Details about the 200
<BR>
most popular prescription drugs in the U.S. in 1999 can be found
<BR>
at www.rxlist.com/top200.htm. These 200 reportedly account for
<BR>
two thirds of all the prescriptions filled each year in the U.S.
<BR>
<P>** Most exposure to drugs and personal care products occurs in
<BR>
the aquatic environment, but it also occurs on land: &quot;...the
<BR>
primary source for terrestrial exposure is probably from disposal
<BR>
of biosolids [sludge] from [sewage treatment plants] and from
<BR>
animal wastes both applied to land and stored in open-air pits
<BR>
(waste lagoons)...&quot; [6,pg.925]
<BR>
<P>** Daughton and Ternes say, &quot;Theoretically, [pharmaceuticals and
<BR>
personal care products] in sewage sludge applied to crop lands
<BR>
could be taken up by plants.&quot;[6,pg.921] Surely everyone can agree
<BR>
that this problem should be examined carefully BEFORE allowing
<BR>
sewage sludge to be mixed with soil.
<BR>
<P>Is this a new problem? Daughton and Ternes show that, &quot;It
<BR>
therefore was clearly recognized over 20 years ago that the
<BR>
continual, daily introduction of kilogram quantities of drugs
<BR>
from a given [sewage treatment plant] into receiving waters could
<BR>
result in sustained concentrations with the potential to lead to
<BR>
exposures in aquatic organisms.&quot; [6,pg.925]
<BR>
<P>But for 20 years regulatory officials and drug corporations have
<BR>
pretended that the problem does not exist, perhaps because they
<BR>
have no idea what to do about it. Now the problem seems about to
<BR>
get worse for three reasons: (1) The genome-induced gold rush to
<BR>
produce new drugs, mentioned above; (2) the Internet, which is
<BR>
allowing people to purchase drugs that they previously could not
<BR>
get their hands on; and (3) recent public hearings by the U.S.
<BR>
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider allowing many
<BR>
prescription drugs to be sold without a prescription. The last
<BR>
time FDA held such hearings, in 1972, 600 drugs switched from
<BR>
prescription to non-prescription status.[7]
<BR>
<P>Christian Daughton, a scientist with U.S. Environmental
<BR>
Protection Agency, is aggressively urging environmental
<BR>
scientists to pay more attention to this problem. However
<BR>
Daughton acknowledges that the problem may already be too large
<BR>
for detailed scientific analysis: &quot;In the final analysis, given
<BR>
the vast array of mechanisms of drug action and side effects, the
<BR>
total number of different toxicity tests possibly required to
<BR>
screen the effluent from a typical [sewage treatment plant] could
<BR>
be impractically large.&quot; [6,pg.923]
<BR>
<P>In June of this year, Daughton and others organized a scientific
<BR>
conference in Minnesota.[8] There, Glen R. Boyd, a civil engineer
<BR>
from Tulane University in New Orleans reported finding drugs in
<BR>
the Mississippi River, in Louisiana's Lake Ponchetrain, and in
<BR>
Tulane's tap water. In all the waters tested, Boyd and his team
<BR>
found low levels of the anti-cholesterol drug clofibric acid
<BR>
along with the pain killer naproxen and the hormone estrone. In
<BR>
Tulane's tap water, estrone averaged 35 parts per trillion with a
<BR>
high of 80 parts per trillion.
<BR>
<P>Naturally, the water-dwelling creatures will bear the brunt of
<BR>
all this because they cannot escape civilized peoples' habit of
<BR>
urinating and defecating in all the available fresh water. At the
<BR>
Minnesota meeting in June a team of scientists reporting finding
<BR>
male carp and walleyes producing &quot;sky high&quot; quantities of
<BR>
vitellogenin, an egg-yolk protein normally made only by females.
<BR>
In 1998, Environment Canada, Canada's federal environmental
<BR>
agency, reported high levels of estrogens and birth control
<BR>
compounds in the effluent of sewage treatment plants nationwide.
<BR>
Chris D. Metcalfe of Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario
<BR>
created laboratory conditions similar to those found by
<BR>
Environment Canada and he reported in June that those conditions
<BR>
cause some fish to become intersex -- having the characteristics
<BR>
of both males and females. Metcalfe has found intersex white
<BR>
perch in the Great Lakes.
<BR>
<P>** Daughton and Ternes say, &quot;A major unaddressed issue regarding
<BR>
human health is the long-term effects of ingesting via potable
<BR>
waters very low subtherapeutic doses of numerous pharmaceuticals
<BR>
multiple times a day for many decades.&quot; [6,pg.923] What will it
<BR>
mean to raise our babies on water contaminated with low levels of
<BR>
birth control drugs and athlete's foot remedies plus Viagra,
<BR>
Prozac, Valium, Claritin, Amoxicillin, Prevachol, Codeine,
<BR>
Flonase, Ibuprofen, Dilantin, Cozaar, Pepcid, Albuterol,
<BR>
Naproxen, Warfarin, Ranitidine, Diazepam, Bactroban, Lotrel,
<BR>
Lorazepam, Tamoxifen, Mevacor, and dozens of other potent drugs,
<BR>
along with hair removers, mosquito repellants, sunburn creams,
<BR>
musks and other fragrances? No one knows, but evidently we're
<BR>
going to find out, learning by doing.
