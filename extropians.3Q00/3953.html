<P>Paul Hughes: Friday 01-Sep-00
<BR>
<EM> &gt; I don't know about you guys, but the recent trends among Corporate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; America to strengthen Intellectual Property Laws beyond the DMCA has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; got me very concerned and agitated.  I'm all for seeing creators of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intellectual property be compensated fairly for their work, but recent
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; moves within our legal system are really starting to  disturb me.
</EM><BR>
<P>As an odd-jobbing programmer and personal computer tech, I have always
<BR>
been uncomfortable with the status-quo attitude that software must be
<BR>
crippled, controlled and constantly battled over in the courts, fair
<BR>
use denied at every possible legalistic opportunity, and all customers
<BR>
generally treated as criminals, sight unseen.  It results Microsoft,
<BR>
a company with any amount of capital wealth, but a flagship product
<BR>
that took twenty years to reach the standard of the Alto.  Compared to
<BR>
the distributed wealth, in dollars, computrons and knowledge generated
<BR>
by open source and shareware development, Silicon Valley can be looked
<BR>
upon as a self-deluding digital third-world.
<BR>
<P>As a transhuman, and considering particularly my own future as a
<BR>
partially or wholly digital mind, I must reject this market entirely.
<BR>
I have no use for laws that would make me a criminal for remembering a
<BR>
piece of music or talking to another mind.
<BR>
<P>Buskware (Street Performer Protocol) seems to me to have the best
<BR>
long-term future.  I will hereon waive all international copyright laws
<BR>
WRT my own personal software creations, request that anyone who finds
<BR>
them useful send me whatever the hell they feel like, and make the
<BR>
information on exactly how much I receive and for what freely available.
<BR>
If this meme progresses beyond the initial bottlenexk the economics are
<BR>
simple, I get paid for useful work, and tippers get the improvements
<BR>
they want from me, and more of the same kind of software from other
<BR>
buskers.
