<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But... weren't you thinking, ok but let's see what happens if you asked
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Napster traders to voluntarily donate a dollar.. hell even a quarter,
</EM><BR>
let's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;say *directly to the artists* (since everyone seems to think it's OK to
</EM><BR>
rip
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;off big companies but not artists), every time they download. What do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;think would happen?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally I'd be happy to give up $.25 for every song that stayed on my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hard drive more than a week.  A buck?  I don't know.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be happy to chuck a few cents out there too.
<BR>
<P>The major problem at the moment with information wanting to be free, is that
<BR>
this means it will be free (notice the clever lack of contextual clues,
<BR>
which means it is impossible to understand what I mean).
<BR>
<P>There's a meme that its ok to get everything which can be transmitted as
<BR>
information for zero cost. Mostly, this is a culture which has stemmed from
<BR>
years of existence of a commercial internet where it is hard to pay, but
<BR>
easy to steal.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I do it too. It's an issue of timeliness (not timelines); when
<BR>
you are looking for information these days, often the deciding criterion is
<BR>
&quot;what can I get my hands on in the next five minutes&quot;. It's a busy time, we
<BR>
are busy people.
<BR>
<P>Commerce tends to work best if it is easier to pay than steal. So either we
<BR>
need to make it harder to steal (approaching impossible), or make it easier
<BR>
to pay. I'm sure Napster would love to have existed in an environment where
<BR>
a micropayment infrastructure was ubiquitous. I am convinced people would
<BR>
pay, say, 10cents to download a song, or a piece of writing. If it's easier
<BR>
to find the legitimate version than the illegitimate version, then that is
<BR>
all the more likely. Even if it is only as easy to find and pay for a legit
<BR>
version, or even if it is only almost as easy, as it is to download a
<BR>
bootleg, many of us will still pay up. We already pay for many of the &quot;free&quot;
<BR>
services out there anyway (except for all those people who swear they are
<BR>
unaffected by advertising - what strength of character!). 10c per download
<BR>
in return for a quality, ad-free service? Sure. We need ecash.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure it will come together in the near term. More and more large orgs
<BR>
are feeling the squeeze from the &quot;information wants to be free&quot; memeset,
<BR>
which has lost it's &quot;information wants to be expensive&quot; suffix. There are a
<BR>
lot of dollars ready to replace that with &quot;information wants to be cheap&quot;.
<BR>
Let's hope it comes together soonish.
<BR>
