<EM>&gt; &gt; What I suggest, is to &quot;cheerfully&quot; explain to the merely curious or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the misinformed that the universe is way-big enough for all kinds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; religions and plenty of room left over for atheists to. Baring that,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if they are persistently obnoxious, give their nuts a healthy tweak.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unfortunately I think you miss Waldemar's point. The misinformed will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simply believe that we are some sort of cult, and then not listen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;us (how often do we *listen* to religious fundamentalists, and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just picking up stuff to make fun of?).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>Thanks Anders!

I think the above shows that the transhumanist movement today lacks a good 
<BR>
analysis of its present environment that my point didn't go through. What 
<BR>
are we perceived as, by the current mainstream? In what ways is it possible 
<BR>
for transhumanism to be negatively/ positively perceived? What are the 
<BR>
opinions of the mainstream on the topics we are discussing?
<BR>
<P>Those are important questions! This because transhumanism is an ideology 
<BR>
with far reaching implications, a system building philosophy! With deep 
<BR>
implications also in the field of political theory, and ethics, this as 
<BR>
certain kinds of politics and ethics will work to the advantage of 
<BR>
transhumanism, and others certainly wont.
<BR>
<P>If we don't care about these issues we are just playing a bit with 
<BR>
computers, or having dreamy discussions about physics. But these things are 
<BR>
not INHERENTLY transhumanist, they could be discussed otherwise. And if we 
<BR>
don't have the tools to bring forward the societal change most will soon get 
<BR>
disillusioned BECAUSE THEY RIGHTLY NOT FIND TRANSHUMANISM PRACTICAL, it's 
<BR>
just a pasttime. But with the right tools, right analysis, and right 
<BR>
arguments we can change the world to a society that fits our ideas better.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Ingdahl
