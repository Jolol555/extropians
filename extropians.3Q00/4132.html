Well, I went to the finals of the robocup, in Melbourne. That's the
<BR>
soccer-playing robots, for the unitiated; see here for details:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.robocup2000.org">http://www.robocup2000.org</A>
<BR>
<P>I only saw the second half of the finals for the bigger robots. These look
<BR>
like suped-up kitchen pedal bins.
<BR>
<P>It's a pretty fun thing to watch, actually. It was Freiburg vs Golem, the
<BR>
germans vs the italians. It came down to 3-3, penalty shootout, with the
<BR>
match going to the germans.
<BR>
<P>The robots looked fairly similar, although they seemed to have some
<BR>
qualitative differences; the Freiburg robots (pink tops) seemed to be faster
<BR>
and slightly more accurate, whilst the Golem robots (blue collars) appeared
<BR>
to be slightly more agile, able to rotate on the spot.
<BR>
<P>Sometimes they seemed pretty smart; seeing one of the Golem robots shoot
<BR>
across the front of the goals to a robot on the other side (just missed the
<BR>
pass, unfortunately, otherwise it would have been a goal for sure), that was
<BR>
pretty impressive. On the other hand, the Golem robots at one point started
<BR>
heading for the wrong goal, just as they were on the verge of scoring.
<BR>
<P>One thing they shared, was a very marginal ability to cope with realtime
<BR>
operation; often, they would pause on the spot, &quot;thinking&quot; for a second or
<BR>
so, before taking action.
<BR>
<P>Their programming seemed relatively brittle; they couldn't cope with much
<BR>
surprise in their environment (like a person standing in front of them).
<BR>
They tended to need to be hand placed on different parts of the field. They
<BR>
looked, as I said, like little garbage bins.
<BR>
<P>For all that, I appreciate the complexity of the task, and see that a lot of
<BR>
ground is being covered. Very cool stuff.
<BR>
<P>Here's the Robocup aim:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;By mid-21st century, a team of fully autonomous robot soccer players shall
<BR>
win a soccer game (complying with the official FIFA rules) against the human
<BR>
winners of the World Cup.
<BR>
<P>They've got a way to go. Keep plugging away!
<BR>
