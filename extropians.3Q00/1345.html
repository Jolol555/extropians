<P>
They say that at the Hollywood Preview of Mel Gibson's _The Patriot_ a
<BR>
large part of the audience audibly gasped at the scene where Mel Gibson
<BR>
hands muskets to the 9 and 12 year old boys who play his youngest sons.
<BR>
I personally take that as a good indicator of how far from the basis
<BR>
upon which our country was founded that Hollywood, the media, and the
<BR>
politically correct aristocracy/intelligentsia in this country has gone.
<BR>
I imagine they would have felt far more comfortable under the rule of
<BR>
King George, with his taxation, gun control laws, confiscation,
<BR>
stormtrooper tactics, and outright abrogation of the civil rights of the
<BR>
individual.
<BR>
<P>Gibson pulls no punches in this gritty, graphic portrayal of one of the
<BR>
more unconventional leaders of the US Revolution. He tells it like it
<BR>
is, or was, much like Speilberg's depiction of WWII in Saving Private
<BR>
Ryan and Schindler's List. No favors are made to spare the sensitivities
<BR>
of current day revisionists, propagandists, or, dare I say, outright
<BR>
traitors to the Constitution. The unconventional brutality Col. Martin
<BR>
and his guerrilla troops visited on the British troops throughout the
<BR>
Carolinas and Virginia is illustrated to be a direct product of the
<BR>
brutality of the British regieme, a lesson our current government would
<BR>
be wise to learn from, though I doubt they will any time soon.
<BR>
<P>It seems odd that the taxation they so strenuously rebelled against, a
<BR>
mere few percent, is dwarfed by the 46% of annual income, per capita,
<BR>
that we now pay in this country, or that the gun confiscation the King
<BR>
wished, and men like Massachusetts Governor General William Gage
<BR>
imposed, to the objections of the men at Lexington and Concord, is now
<BR>
bandied about in the halls of congress and the meeting halls of the
<BR>
people of the land as if it were an immenently reasonable proposition.
<BR>
<P>It seems odd that laws like the death sentence for cutting and milling
<BR>
white pine which had been marked with the Kings Cross are now bandied
<BR>
about to apply to millions of Americans who cut and use another
<BR>
naturally occuring plant, marijuana. Two million of them are already
<BR>
either imprisoned, arrested, indicted, or on probation for the harmless
<BR>
use of this natural medicine and relaxant, and while we are winning a
<BR>
few skirmishes in a few states, the feds use of an engineered fungus to
<BR>
wipe out the Coca plant from Columbia in the most recent campaigns
<BR>
presages a day when the government will use genetically engineered
<BR>
biowarfare against its own citizens to eradicate the marijuana plant
<BR>
from existence (Endangered Species Act be damned).
<BR>
<P>It also seems odd that strongarm tactics, like those seen in the scene
<BR>
where the Dragoon Colonel shoots Col. Martin's 15 year old son Thomas in
<BR>
the back (much like that young son was shot in the back at Ruby Ridge)
<BR>
during an umprovoked raid on Martin's home (which is put to the torch,
<BR>
much like the footage we all recall seeing during the final stage of the
<BR>
Seige at Waco), are now seen as a normal tactic of law enforcement, be
<BR>
it by the BATF, the FBI, the DEA, or merely your State and local police
<BR>
forces. The public merely 'ho hums' at news of one more raid (if they
<BR>
are even mentioned in the press, which is no longer the fifth estate,
<BR>
but merely a wholly owned and operated subsidiary propaganda arm of big
<BR>
government and its mercantilist multinational owners, which brings up
<BR>
the subject of representation....)
<BR>
<P>Martin was originally resistant to declaring independence, and refused
<BR>
to fight, as he was dealing still with the sins of his past during his
<BR>
service years before in the French and Indian War, where he fought in so
<BR>
brutal a manner that the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French to
<BR>
avoid further atrocities against their people by Martin's men. 
<BR>
<P>Speaking in the State Assembly against independence, he asked,&quot;What is
<BR>
the use of ridding ourselves of one tyrant three thousand miles away, if
<BR>
we accept three thousand tyrants one mile away? An elected legislature
<BR>
can strip a man of his rights just as easily as a distant king.&quot; Whether
<BR>
Martin actually said this, or is merely a case of Gibson sticking a
<BR>
finger in the eyes of those who claim our democracy protects us against
<BR>
tyranny is immaterial, as it cuts right to the heart of the matter of
<BR>
the present. 
<BR>
<P>Gibson is known to run counter to the socialistic syncophants running
<BR>
Hollywood and the media these days, and is avidly pro-gun rights. It is
<BR>
good to see more such people like Gibson, Tom Selleck, and Ted Nugent
<BR>
stand up for their beleifs, and it is about time that someone like
<BR>
Gibson can realise commercial success at the same time, as it is obvious
<BR>
that he is too big a cat for the dogs in Hollywood or Washington to
<BR>
attempt to black ball. Nugent was sidelined, which I know is what keeps
<BR>
Steve Tyler of Aerosmith at bay politically. He cares more about earning
<BR>
his $50 mil a year than speaking his mind. Selleck has been pretty well
<BR>
black balled, only earning the rare cameo role on pathetic shows like
<BR>
Friends. Charlton Heston is just too damn old and curmudgeonly for
<BR>
Hollywood to have any effect on, but both knowledgable and erudite
<BR>
enough to be able to tell the press where to stick it on occasion. I can
<BR>
imagine that in another 20 or 30 years, Gibson will be elected NRA
<BR>
President, assuming that the NRA has not become an outlawed group by
<BR>
that point in time...
<BR>
<P>What can I say? It is a heroic story, so the ending you all know is
<BR>
obviously a happy one, the bad guys get their come uppance at Yorktown
<BR>
(if not before), the young and innocent die young and innocent, while
<BR>
the sinners among us remain to pick up the pieces and toil once again to
<BR>
make this a better world. The movie is intended to make one wonder why
<BR>
the present day seems to be full of either happy red coats (socialistic
<BR>
syncophants), or cowardly summer soldiers and sunshine patriots, when we
<BR>
are once again living in the hour of our discontent (or we are content,
<BR>
so long as our stock portfolios are on the up and up, with our noses
<BR>
roped to the trough of earning and debt....)
