<EM>&gt; &gt; Er, wait a minute! ....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can imagine a destructive readout approach with nothing more than extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very fine tissue slicers combined with near field microscopy ... In my mind this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't an &quot;upload&quot;  but a &quot;copyload&quot;.   ... a lot of antibodies or other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neurotransmitter identifiction ... probably beyond current technology ... It might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be feasible in ten or so years ... My guess though is that that type of readout
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be quite slow and very expensive.  ...  5 Terabytes of information just to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; store the brain map ... Getting it into main memory ... circa 2010-2015.  Even then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is going to be a pretty sizable computer.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that is what I had in mind, though I think &quot;upload&quot; is a reasonable term for it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think Robin is a fan of &quot;copyload&quot; even if destructive readout is required ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (You have to remember, he's the author of the theory that the person who gets to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the playhouse first gets to monopolize all the toys... :-)).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I probably prefer more of a gradual evolutionary &quot;upload&quot; process over many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years.  I'd bet David prefers this as well.  The &quot;copyload&quot; process can probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be done without &quot;real&quot; nanotech.  The &quot;evoload&quot; process probably requires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long term, real time monitoring and that would require either *very*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advanced biotech or real med-nano-tech.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the first priority is to analyze what is likely to happen with us pushing for
<BR>
any particular thing, and then we can decide what we want to push for.   I think it
<BR>
likely that we will have the ability to create a single expensive &quot;upload&quot; (for less
<BR>
than $1B) well before advanced nanotech, and given the vast amounts of money to be
<BR>
made from one this is what will happen.  Then its a matter of filling market niches
<BR>
and business competition that I think leads to domination of the upload economy by
<BR>
the first few thousand, and perhaps the first few ten, uploads.  By the time your
<BR>
&quot;evoloads&quot; show up, the game is basically over.
