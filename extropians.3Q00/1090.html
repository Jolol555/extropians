<EM>&gt; &gt;Actually, no. If the file is encrypted such that each successive play requires a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;new key to decrypt, which must be downloaded from the recording company's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;keyserver on a pay per play basis (i.e. no key can be used twice on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;same downloaded file), then you have a very secure file format.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well I will then write a small app that reads the values sent to /dev/audio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and will have a perfect copy from there ... If it is output digital anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without the key, it can be copied.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Which is the crux of the problem.  If you control the hardware, you can
<BR>
get the unencrypted data.  Any protocol that uses software encryption is
<BR>
necessarily hackable from the start.  The only reasonably protected
<BR>
options wouldn't fly in the market because they would essentially take
<BR>
over your systems at the hardware level -- something that would
<BR>
effectively be a &quot;security through obscurity&quot; solution if practical.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I can even wire up another computer and just record it with that. very small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loss in quality.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>With current top end 24-bit project cards and good audio drivers, you
<BR>
could easily get a dithered audio signal that was essentially as good as
<BR>
the Red Book source recording.  With a loopback through your converters you
<BR>
could get a super-clean Red Book digital recording that was essentially
<BR>
perfect. 
<BR>
<P>Also, and more importantly, purely digital audio interfaces (SPDIF,
<BR>
AES/EBU, ADAT, TDIF, etc) are valid audio outputs on every operating
<BR>
system that I've ever used.  It would trivial to tap a lossless digital
<BR>
signal off one of these interfaces.
