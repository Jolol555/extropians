<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Jamiro2002&quot;, please reveal your true name so that I may file a lawsuit for

<EM>&gt; &gt; slander against you. Such lies pass *my* limit for tolerance.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps Jamiro is one of our Scientologist friends.  I wonder which of us will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be the next target of wild accusations, and of what heinous act we will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accused of committing.  {8-[ spike

<P>Please forgive me for replying to my own post but this has me thinking.
<BR>
A few months ago I speculated on the use of the internet for taking
<BR>
pot shots at public figures.  We extropians have *plenty* of political
<BR>
opponents, and so if anything I am surprised such attacks have not
<BR>
occurred before now.
<BR>
<P>Allow me to speculate that in the last two or three days before the
<BR>
U.S. presidential elections this November, both W and algore will
<BR>
become unrepentent child molesters, as will most of their staff.
<BR>
{This particular accusation appears to be the worst possible brickbat
<BR>
with which to slime political opponents, for accusations are easy,
<BR>
defenses are not.}  The news of their improprieties will be widely
<BR>
disseminated on the internet, perhaps right up into the final hours
<BR>
before the polls close.  I further predict a flurry of accusations of
<BR>
financial wrongdoing by both candidates, again in such a way that
<BR>
is impossible to defend in the short time before the elections.
<BR>
<P>Let me add to the chorus: I have never heard any untoward rumors
<BR>
regarding either Max or Keith.  I know both to be morally upstanding,
<BR>
the finest of gentlemen.  Jamiro's anonymous post is a transparent
<BR>
attempt at politically motivated slander, which in itself is cowardly
<BR>
and morally reprehensible, as well as being absurd.
<BR>
<P>That being said, I urge every extropian to stand fearlessly and
<BR>
steadfastly in the face of the threat of similar baseless rumors and attack
<BR>
posts that could victimize any one of us here.  The more prominent
<BR>
ones among us are at an even greater threat than the more obscure.
<BR>
We have all posted that which is politically unacceptable to someone
<BR>
out there in this big world.  We have placed our opinions into the
<BR>
public record.  Any one of us here could become an infant-raping
<BR>
old-lady-beater simply for having stated an unpopular opinion.
<BR>
Do not back down, move forward.  spike
