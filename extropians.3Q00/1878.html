Title
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Decreased incidence of prostate cancer with selenium supplementation: results
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a double-blind cancer prevention trial.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;British Journal of Urology.  81(5):730-4, 1998 May.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;OBJECTIVE: To test if supplemental dietary selenium is associated with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;changes in the incidence of prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;974 men with a history of either a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;randomized to either a daily supplement of 200 microg of selenium or a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;placebo. Patients were treated for a mean of 4.5 years and followed for a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mean of 6.5 years. RESULTS: Selenium treatment was associated with a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significant (63%) reduction in the secondary endpoint of prostate cancer
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incidence during 1983-93. There were 13 prostate cancer cases in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;selenium-treated group and 35 cases in the placebo group (relative risk,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;RR=0.37, P=0.002). Restricting the analysis to the 843 patients with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;initially normal levels of prostate-specific antigen (&lt; or = 4 ng/mL), only
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;four cases were diagnosed in the selenium-treated group and 16 cases were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;diagnosed in the placebo group after a 2 year treatment lag, (RR=0.26
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;P=0.009). There were significant health benefits also for the other secondary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;endpoints of total cancer mortality, and the incidence of total, lung and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;colorectal cancer. There was no significant change in incidence for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;primary endpoints of basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In light
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of these results, the 'blinded' phase of this trial was stopped early.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSIONS: Although selenium shows no protective effects against the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;primary endpoint of squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;selenium-treated group had substantial reductions in the incidence of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;prostate cancer, and total cancer incidence and mortality that demand further
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluation in well-controlled prevention trials.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional comment by poster:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't get your hopes up too much. Well controlled prevention trials
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cost a lot of money and selenium being non-patentible is not a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;profitable enough commodity to generate much cash for research.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years have gone by and these results have not been followed up, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nor is there any prospect in the near future.
