<P>
I have a completely different take on implanted ID's: I hope we get them, 
<BR>
and soon.
<BR>
<P>You see, I see this country (USA) as our property; it's our asset. We all 
<BR>
derive our living from it. The benefits from our work here accrue to us (in 
<BR>
large part).
<BR>
<P>And even the taxes benefit us, if unevenly.
<BR>
<P>I agree that my view is not the commonly held one, but is is the one that 
<BR>
IMO defines the situation best. The benefits accrue to this who live and 
<BR>
work here (although I agree that some do not work, when they could). But 
<BR>
some come here to &quot;steal&quot; the benefits that accrue to us, the owners. They 
<BR>
may well come here to work, and there is work here, and often it is good. 
<BR>
That work is here because of the benefits of investing capital here versus 
<BR>
somewhere else.
<BR>
<P>But that right --the right to our jobs, which are available here because of 
<BR>
the qualities of this country (our property)--are available only to us, the 
<BR>
owners. Therefore many &quot;steal&quot; our property by working here, when they did 
<BR>
not &quot;buy in&quot;.
<BR>
<P>You may say that this is a highly abstracted view, but I find it useful.
<BR>
<P>You may well argue that more people here enhances the value of our property 
<BR>
because an large pool of labor attracts capital, and that there are 
<BR>
synergistic effects as a result. Perhaps, but are there no limits to such an 
<BR>
effect? Does a larger labor pool benefit some owners, and hurt others? I do 
<BR>
find the idea that allowing highly educated people in would benefit most 
<BR>
owners, but I see most immmigrants on the bus I ride every day. They do not 
<BR>
bring much with them except there strong, young backs and reproductive 
<BR>
systems.
<BR>
<P>Oh, yes, they DO bring their brains, but the quality of brains varies 
<BR>
widely. Some brains are well-educated, others are not, and many of those 
<BR>
riding the buses these says do not appear to want to be such (educated). 
<BR>
They have allowed the upper classes in their own countries to rob them 
<BR>
blind, and they will likely do so here as well.
<BR>
<P>Many of these immigrants send much of their money home, to be spent in some 
<BR>
other country. Who benefits from these immigrants? The wealthy west side of 
<BR>
Houston certainly does! Now they can get a maid for $10,000/yr instead of 
<BR>
$16,000. Also, the tabs at the foo-foo westside eateries are not quite so 
<BR>
high, thanks to the cheap dishwashers.
<BR>
<P><P>I can do without these benefits, myself. Convince me otherwise...
<BR>
<P>Until then, I say bring on the ID implants...
