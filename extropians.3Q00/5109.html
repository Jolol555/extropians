<P>
While we're posting the best methods for succeeding or failing at startups,
<BR>
here's Bob Cringely's list from Slashdot today
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/09/15/0155218">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/09/15/0155218</A>):
<BR>
<P>Now to the rules for success. I started out to do five of these and ended up
<BR>
with eight. They apply not just to Internet companies but to any high tech
<BR>
startup. They are simple: 1) Fill a need that actually exists, not one you
<BR>
wish existed; 2) Don't count on customers to tell you what that need is
<BR>
(they don't know what they need until you invent it and they see it); 3)
<BR>
Don't push the technological edge because you'll nearly always starve to
<BR>
death; 4) Be very quick to recognize the greatness of others and copy it (in
<BR>
other words, let someone else be responsible for rule 2, above) because the
<BR>
second entrant wins more often that does the originator; 5) Success comes
<BR>
from selling things, so hire a better head of sales and marketing than you
<BR>
think you can afford and hire him/her earlier than you think you should; 6)
<BR>
Every startup has a change of course, a moment when it becomes clear that
<BR>
the original idea just won't work, so be willing to change course when you
<BR>
have to; 7) Know when to call it a day -- most startups fail and nearly
<BR>
every successful startup is run and staffed by people who have already
<BR>
failed, and; 8) Hire a mix of old and young including some people near the
<BR>
top who have already tasted startup success.
<BR>
<P>I don't think he'd rate the chances of
<BR>
GoddamnedGeneticProgrammingTyrannosauruses.com as very high, unfortunately.

(Thanks to Mr Broderick for telling me who Bob Cringely is. I live such a
<BR>
sheltered life; must be my over active mushroom module. When are you going
<BR>
to go Rand/Hubbard on us, and start up a religion, Damien?)

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree.  So why aren't we out building that system today?  Wanna put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; together a business plan and go looking for funding?  Seriously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm a bit afraid that the business plan would look something like:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     1 - Get lots o money
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     2 - Spend lots o money doing heaps of cool research into genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; programming, play around with oh so excellent equipment, discover some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; excellent stuff, have a bloody fantastic time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     3 - Run out of money with no products/market to show for it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     4 - get a slapping (eek) from the VC(s)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     5 - Reputation in ruins, become a tramp, scavenge in bins, waiting
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the singularity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I might suggest a little alteration...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.1 - Think of something you can get to market, with some research, kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       of a milestone between here and the promised land
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.2 - Map out how you can get from where you are now, plus money, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       having that product on the market, accessible by whatever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       professionals (or, depending on application, hobbyist or regular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       person) can make use of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 0.9 - Present that plan to the VCs as a prerequisite to step 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.1 - Also ask the VCs for management, marketing, and sales help: you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       can do the technical stuff, but there's more to a corp than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       CTO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.2 - Try to structure things so that you, and others who share your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       viewpoint as to the end goal of the corporation, control a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       majority (or as close to it as possible) of the corporation;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       most of this control can be slient partners/&quot;sleepers&quot; until 4.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.1 - Keep at least the majority of your research focussed on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       product, or perhaps line of products by now, that you came up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       in 0.1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.2 - As you near production capability, get the help that the VCs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       pointed you at to start prepping some test clients, maybe an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       entire market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3.0 - Deploy product well before selling out of money: at this point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       your sales are just slowing the outflow of cash, not stopping it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       completely or even reversing it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3.1 - With experience gained from all steps to date, *especially* step
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       2.0, come up with more products that you can either deploy now, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       can be deployed with a bit more research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3.2 - Keep doing radical research - still with a focus, at least until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       you get profitable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.0 - Eventually go IPO or get bought out, kissing off the VCs for good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       either way, and go profitable shortly thereafter; remember to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       keep control of the company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.1 - With money worries gone (and the VCs who remind you to focus on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       the bottom line out of your hair), research can be even freer;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       some products should still come out of it, if only as proof that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       the research is relevant to reality, as opposed to hypotheticals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       on some metaphysics that are of no practical use (and, having not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       been reviewed by others, might turn out to be based on a false
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       foundation, thus being totally useless in the end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5.0 - Reputation established, and with a growing financial resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       base, help build the Singularity in the way you think it should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Of course, for &quot;product&quot; you can substitute any source of financial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profit.  For instance, if you can think of a service that only you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide - you having mastered the field through your research - then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would be an early-stage-useful target for your research.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The key here is not to do everything at once.  Go for something you know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can do, then build on that, and you just might have a chance.
