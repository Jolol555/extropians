<P><EM>&gt;Biologically, this has not been an option in the past for the fetus.

<EM>&gt;But as Barbara suggests, with improving technology this will eventually

<EM>&gt;change.  It will be possible to extract an unwanted fetus and raise it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outside the mother's body.

<BR>
<EM>&gt;Could this be a compromise on the abortion issue acceptable to many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parties?
</EM><BR>
<P>With a modest effort, we could probably develop the technology for 
<BR>
transplanting a fetus from one womb to another.  There are lots of
<BR>
details to work out, but I don't think it's harder than other things
<BR>
we do now, like in-utero surgery or reattaching severed body parts.
<BR>
<P>The biggest gotcha is that for now, and some time to come, destructive 
<BR>
extraction of a fetus (abortion) is less hazardous to the birth mother 
<BR>
than non-destructive extraction (transplantation, Caesarean birth,
<BR>
many natural births).
<BR>
<P>And a pro-choice advocate could reasonably ask why a woman should be
<BR>
compelled to expose herself to greater risk of injury or death.
<BR>
<P>OTOH, it's a plausible compromise.  Specifics are important.  Is this
<BR>
a voluntary option, or the only legal alternative to childbirth?  If
<BR>
it's involuntary, could the compromise be that 1st trimester abortions 
<BR>
are okay, but if you want to end a pregnancy in the 2nd trimester, you 
<BR>
have to do it this way?  Does it matter whether the pregnancy was entered
<BR>
voluntarily or not?  In line with the question of father's rights, is
<BR>
this a reasonable solution to the case where mom wants an abortion but
<BR>
dad wants the baby?
<BR>
<P>In any case, I think I'd like to see the technology developed.  It could 
<BR>
be useful in non-abortion situations as well.  For example, if the birth 
<BR>
mother has toxemia, it might be safer for both mother and child to move 
<BR>
the baby to a surrogate mother.
