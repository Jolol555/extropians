<EM>&gt; &gt; The reason for an armed populace is very, very fundamental:

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you actually view it to be self-evident that we have a creator, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that he (sorry, &quot;He&quot;) endowed us with rights?  I not only don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is self-evident, but I don't even think it is at all likely.  Is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the foundation for why you believe we should have an armed populace?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hal, you keep thinking in deiocentric terms. You have not always existed, right?
<BR>
You came into being at some point. You were created by some cause. You parents?
<BR>
Definitely. Nature? Definitely. Some 'god'? Indeterminate. Note that Forrest's
<BR>
quote does not say THE creator, but 'their creator', referring to the creator of
<BR>
each individual, in respect to each individual.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Nature has not endowed man with claw, nor fang, nor talon, nor horn, but with
<BR>
the hand. Any tool or weapon that a man can wield with the hand is his natural
<BR>
right to use and posess.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Likewise, in a state of nature, man speaks, associates, thinks and worships
<BR>
freely, roams where he wills, constructs technological artifacts from raw
<BR>
materials, mates, raises a family, provides for himself and his family and
<BR>
friends, and defends all these against the depredations of time, nature, and
<BR>
other humans, all these are his natural right to do, as he has been evolved to
<BR>
do.
