<EM>&gt;  &gt; I think you've hit on the core concept of why AI would want to be friendly:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; AIs are us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where do you think a bunch of mutually competitive uploads are headed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you're not part of the fray? AIs might beat them on the path to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SI, if given a chance, but I doubt there will be much subjective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference between them two from an outsider's point of view. (Which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably means that it's not a good idea to play the role of a bemused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onlooker).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One or two of them might be still human (and nice) enough to yank the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bystanders into the virtual realm to prevent them from going extinct,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before zooming off to SI.
</EM><BR>
<P>The uploads might even decide it was far more advantageous to work much
<BR>
more cooperatively than humans do today.  Then some of the competitive
<BR>
survival of the fittest arguments might carry less weight.
