<P>This could be a nightmare. What do you think? If the militaries are in an
<BR>
AI race what does it mean? What if we are only a decade or so away from AI
<BR>
to surpass human equivalency on all major measured outcomes of
<BR>
intelligence including learning ability? What if the present
<BR>
state-of-the-art is that it 'only' takes x billions of dollars (available
<BR>
to the militaries) and machines will be on hand which are more
<BR>
&quot;learned&quot; than humans and can add to that learning better and faster than
<BR>
humans? They can then work on advancing military science 24 hours a
<BR>
day. It makes Roswell conspiracy theories pale by comparison. But then
<BR>
this is all just distant futuristic fantasy, right? And we the public can
<BR>
sit back and know that private and military AI research is many decades
<BR>
away from any such state of development.
