<EM> &gt; Exterminating a successful species seems sort of like punnishing a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; successful software company, except that the eels have no means within our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; social system to represent or defend their interests.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Er, the eels are unnatural in the sense that they wouldn't have popped
<BR>
up at that particular place in that particular time without the
<BR>
intervention of these meddling humans. (Assuming, that humans
<BR>
themselves are unnatural, of course, which is a matter of
<BR>
definition. Clearly, they're rather special animals, and hence should
<BR>
be treated specially). Biosphere has not yet adapted to species
<BR>
hitch-hikin' all over the globe, so this results in critters with a
<BR>
differing fitness being suddunly introduced into an already occupied
<BR>
niche, resulting in all kinds of havoc, until the system falls into a
<BR>
stable attractor, eventually. Humans attempt to reestablish the status
<BR>
quo which would have existed without them introducing a new species
<BR>
into an existing equilibrium (which, of course, in the purist's point
<BR>
of view is already denaturated by humans having been present there).
<BR>
<P>I personally find these efforts highly valuable, since teaching people
<BR>
the meaning of &quot;irreversibility&quot; hands-on.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; I find it amusing how arbitrarily many humans seem to assign value to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; species on this planet.
