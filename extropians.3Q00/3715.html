... The pens were extremely small, one

<EM>&gt; different types of food. Once the animal grew to a certain size, it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; placed in a sling so that it's feet barely touched the ground and it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force fed several times a day and massaged with Sake and/or beer. The object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the alcoholic rubdowns was to calm the frustrated animal, which was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly stressed after being placed in the sling. When it came time for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slaughter they injected Papaya juice into the animals veins so that it would

<P>The point of this post is? Cattle are, by far, about as high a body mass to
<BR>
brain mass one can get in a mammal. There may be animals more stupid than
<BR>
cattle, moose for instance, though that may be due to parasites rather than
<BR>
physiology. Making them more stupid, without causing them to cease involuntary
<BR>
functions altogether, would basically turn the animals into the meat equivalent
<BR>
of a plant, which makes one wonder why there would then be any objection to
<BR>
eating them if they are in fact mammalian vegetables.
<BR>
<P>Japanese agricultural methods should be the ideal that vegans aspire to. The way
<BR>
they breed, coddle and polish each and every apple, tomato, or other fruit,
<BR>
vegetable, or in this case, cow to acheive the highest possible food quality is
<BR>
a testament to their tradition of gourmet food excellence.
<BR>
<P>Instead, what many primitivist vegas seem to want is for everyone to have to eat
<BR>
pest ridden, rotting vegetable matter without the aid of refrigeration,
<BR>
freezing, irradiation, canning, preservatives, or any other means of growing,
<BR>
storing or preparing food in order to reduce spoilage. Such policies can only
<BR>
result in increasing the amount of wilderness plowed under to eat the masses.
<BR>
Vegans are the problem, not the solution.
