From: Ross A. Finlayson
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;After the fixed costs, reproducing software is basically a costless
</EM><BR>
operation.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I see those as obvious statements.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes but the fixed price in music is very high for an individual without hope
<BR>
of  making money back.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Linux or the other free UNIXs were not free, they are made from thousands
</EM><BR>
upon
<BR>
<EM>&gt;thousands of programmer hours and precursor code, they were just freely
</EM><BR>
given.
<BR>
<P>They were freely shared. That is different. You share and you get something
<BR>
back because of the GNU license. Thus everybody gets a better tool to work
<BR>
with.
<BR>
<P>Music is (usually) neither freely given nor shared. A musician who's music
<BR>
is copied does not get anything back from the comunity. He might himself get
<BR>
free music, but that doesn't buy him bread. It's sort of a reverse &quot;Tragedy
<BR>
of the commons&quot;. He looses and socity wins. In the short term at least, as
<BR>
he would quickly stop producing music.
<BR>
<P>Linux has been paid for one way or another. The price might be hidden but it
<BR>
has been paid and it has been thriving on the swing/carrousel principle.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There is a concept of sum societal utility.  Linux, free, has contributed
</EM><BR>
to the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;sum societal utility many times over its investment given by volunteer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;programmers and supporters, some might say.  Some statistics have it
</EM><BR>
running
<BR>
<EM>&gt;half the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<P>It has made it cheaper to run an IT business yes. But not more than that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Copyright laws are in place for a reason, and most of them are good laws.
</EM><BR>
Some
<BR>
<EM>&gt;patent laws, in my opinion, are cumbersome and infringe upon the growth of
</EM><BR>
sum
<BR>
<EM>&gt;societal utility, and any patent should expire in twelve years.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ahh... we probably agree here.
<BR>
