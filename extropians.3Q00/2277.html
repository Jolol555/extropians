<EM>&gt;&gt;Actually I had an advanced class specifically on the study of Shakespeare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and his works when I was in high school. My teacher explained that his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;written diction was embellished, and that common folk were not speaking so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;eloquently. (thee and thou art etc.) I don't know how valid that is, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;had asked her about it, and that was her answer.

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; But Spike EVERYBODY talked like that back then, forsooth. Its a pretty

<EM>&gt;&gt;clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; progression from Chaucer to Shakespeare to the present day that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;grammar of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; the english language is devolving to some point in the future of pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;gutteral.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In case you've never experienced this, there are chat rooms in which the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resemblance to standard English is rather tenuous.  The participants, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usually high-school kids or younger, but obviously international in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;background, have evolved their own semi-phonetic Englich derivative in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which entire phrases are often condensed into a single word that more or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less phonetically sounds like the original English - very much like the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taxi-drivers language in Stephenson's Snow Crash.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would definitely have to agree with this. I hang out in various IRC 
<BR>
channels for various things, and it has a &quot;net language&quot; all it's own.
<BR>
90% of the unusual words come from an inside joke somewhere, and have taken 
<BR>
on a new meaning. Like who would say &quot;w00t!&quot; in real life? but in IRC, I 
<BR>
see it very commonly as a replacement for &quot;yeah!&quot; or &quot;woohoo!&quot;.(Came from a 
<BR>
joke about tourette's syndrome) Same thing with all the acronyms, the 
<BR>
language has changed itself to fit it's environment of having to be able to 
<BR>
communicate faster, since it is a real-time chat. Slow typers/readers often 
<BR>
get left behind in the conversation in a busy room. And to people who are 
<BR>
unfamilar with the environment, it is totally foreign. I realized this when 
<BR>
my brother was over at my house, and was looking at my computer that I had 
<BR>
left an IRC client running on, and he asked me  what I had considered to be 
<BR>
everyday terms were.
