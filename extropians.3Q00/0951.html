<EM>&gt;That article just has David Henderson complaining about failed short term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;predictions of US GDP growth and oil prices.  Most economists have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surprised by GDP growth.  And as Damien Sullivan noted, oil prices have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rebounded lately.  I do agree that Krugman's prediction of rising resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prices was the least persuasive of his six main prediction areas.  But even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that isn't crazy - I'd give it at least a 20% chance of happening.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said, that was just the source I came across, and I do like many 
<BR>
things Krugman has written. I actually think his point about the declining 
<BR>
long-term value of &quot;symbol manipulators&quot; (or similar term) is interesting 
<BR>
and plausible, though I think it will turn out quite differently than the 
<BR>
future he portrays. OTOH, the fact that lots of other economists were 
<BR>
surprised by US GDP growth isn't a *defense* of Krugman, except in relative 
<BR>
terms. And I agree with you that of his six predictions, the rising 
<BR>
resource prices was the least persuasive.
<BR>
<P>As I've said, Krugman and most economists can be faulted for not understanding
<BR>
<EM>&gt;specific technologies in more detail.  But most futurists can be faulted for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not understanding much economics.  The later sin seems much greater to me.
</EM><BR>
<P>As someone with a degree in economics I can smugly agree with you, though I 
<BR>
wouldn't call it a &quot;sin&quot;. Looking back at the history of future 
<BR>
projections, it's clear that many went seriously wrong because of a failure 
<BR>
to consider economic factors. I'm currently studying scenario planning. 
<BR>
This doesn't really try to predict THE future, but to lay out several 
<BR>
possible futures depending on underlying driving forces. Clearly economics 
<BR>
AND technology are important driving forces.
<BR>
<P>Overall, I find Krugman mostly okay. It's just, as I said before, that I 
<BR>
don't think he really understands some of the changes in the economy very 
<BR>
well. He may not have read recent good books in business theory. The best 
<BR>
of the business theorists seem to grasp changes in business models due to 
<BR>
new technologies better than most economists I've observed. So I would say 
<BR>
futurists would do well to understand technology, economics, AND business 
<BR>
theory. (Plus philosophy, culture...)
<BR>
<P>Onward!
