<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't necessarily want lots of copies. What am interested in is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;continuing.   If there is this effect of first-uploaded-best-dressed, it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;could mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;substantia difficulty for those not in the first wave; maybe even being
</EM><BR>
at
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the mercy of the first wave deciding who gets uploaded and who is worm
</EM><BR>
food.

<EM>&gt; Well if this is your goal, declaring you are willing to be uploaded at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10% chance of success is clearly the wrong strategy.  If they take you up
</EM><BR>
on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; your offer, your strategy results in a 90% chance of dying completely
</EM><BR>
forever.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Instead you should just get rich and wait.  If you have a lot of money
</EM><BR>
when
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you are revived, and you wait until uploading tech gets reliable, you
</EM><BR>
won't
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be one of the first uploads of which there are billions or trillions of
</EM><BR>
copies,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; but you would be able to afford to create one or a few uploads of yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are rich enough they don't need to work.  Being willing to accept a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher probability of revival failure is the strategy for people who care
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; lot just how many copies of them there are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is probably where there's a conflict with singularity/no singularity
<BR>
scenarios. I see mega-copied uploads as a recipe for singularity, esp. if
<BR>
you've uploaded people savvy about their upload environment (admittedly this
<BR>
is not likely for a cryonaut). So I think getting rich &amp; waiting is likely a
<BR>
path to failure in this endeavour; it doesn't matter how much money you've
<BR>
got, it'll still be (in a singularity scenario) the first uploads who decide
<BR>
if you get to come on board, or are fed to the carnobots.
<BR>
<P>In a non-singularity environment, of course you are correct; it's better to
<BR>
wait until the kinks are ironed out, then get uploaded into MS Upload v27.
<BR>
In this scenario, yes, the corporate AIs are at worst oppressed slaves, at
<BR>
best citizens like you or I. I think it supposes that their (upload's)
<BR>
mental abilities will remain in the same ballpark as a regular humans; I'd
<BR>
like to see that position defended.
