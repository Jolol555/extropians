<P><EM>&gt; There's no &quot;certainty&quot; to it at all. What you have stated is nothing

<P><EM>&gt; We KNOW that an embryo is not a human being, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Phil, I think you're not distinguishing between the idea of being
<BR>
genetically human &amp; the idea of being a member of a community entitled to
<BR>
culturally granted rights.  The attempt to find some naturally occurring
<BR>
fixed point at which an immature human is transformed into a full member
<BR>
of the community seems similar to the attempt to define &quot;natural&quot; rights.
<BR>
&nbsp;The concepts turn out not to be very useful in practice and require the
<BR>
supposition of a god who endows the  individual with natural rights and
<BR>
breathes a soul into the fetus or embryo or newborn (whichever happens to
<BR>
be the transformation point for the particular culture).  
<BR>
<P>Culturally granted rights and duties must be thought about and determined
<BR>
by at lest some members of each culture.  It's true that most people
<BR>
don't give much thought to these ideas but instead accept them as given
<BR>
and have difficulty imagining any other way of life.  Nevertheless, at
<BR>
some point in time, someone or ones DID think about these things  and
<BR>
make decisions. 
<BR>
<P>If you use intelligence as a measure of humanness (which you seem to be
<BR>
doing, Phil), then you're faced with the burden of not granting rights to
<BR>
anyone who doesn't measure up.  I think such a definition might allow for
<BR>
infanticide since, even if newborn babies are very intelligent, they
<BR>
don't have any way to communicate that fact-- they can't talk or focus
<BR>
their eyes very well or ever hold up their heads.  Pretty much all they
<BR>
can do is eat, puke,  piss, and shit.  They're very cute, though,
<BR>
especially when they see you and break into a big, glowing smile.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I think cuteness may have a lot to do with most people's idea
<BR>
of when a fetus becomes a person.  If you look at the antiabortion web
<BR>
sites, you see lots of photos of nearly full-term fetuses thrown into
<BR>
garbage bags or chopped up into pieces.  These get to you a lot more than
<BR>
photos of human embryos that look like pigs with gills.  I think if a
<BR>
person wanted to &quot;get away with&quot; cloning humans, they'd want to alter the
<BR>
genetic makeup to the extent of giving the creature a hideous appearance,
<BR>
a face and form that not even a mother could love.  A gargoyle.
