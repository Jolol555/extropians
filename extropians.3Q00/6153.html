<P><EM>&gt; Lets say your policy with your PPL states 'no death penalty for murder'. Mine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mandates it for murder. Every PPL contract mandates no initiation of force. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kill me. My PPL arrests you, and because you breached your 'no initiation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force' clause in your contract, your PPL is not obligated to prevent your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; execution, although they are obligated to determine if you actually initiated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force against me unprovoked, or were defending yourself against my initiation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or whether your actions were the result of accident or negligence. They thus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provide your defense in arbitration with prosecutors from my PPL. Arbitrators
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be independent of both parties. Prosecution would pay for the trial,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject to recovery from the convicted if a conviction results.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>There are several problems here.  Like, why my PPL should automatically
<BR>
drop me just because I am accused of a crime but not yet convicted.  If
<BR>
convicted I should be governed by the rules of my PPL, not yours. 
<BR>
Otherwise my PPL contract is really, &quot;we won't execute you for murder
<BR>
but we will disown you once we're sure you did it.&quot;  This is not a PPL
<BR>
with any real closure.  Also, who determines the rules of evidence and
<BR>
courtroom proceedings?  Your PPL? Mine? Neither? Both?  How does this
<BR>
work?  What sets of rules or organization govern the arbitrators?  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Private law is nothing new. 99% of legal action between the USPS and the postal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unions are in fact done on a private basis with arbitrators already. According
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to my postal union friends, it costs about 1/4 as much as going the public court
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; route, they do have a body of precedent of past arbitration to work from (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designed a judgement search database for one of the regional union arbitration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reps), and so long as the union does its job to take care of its members, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system works quite well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Within some limits determined by the overall legal system. Private law
<BR>
(like the way IRS cases used to be run) is certainly not an unmitigated
<BR>
blessing. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Arguing from analogy does nothing to address the point raised.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Predictability of a reasonable degree is quite relevant if you want a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; generally sane and peaceful society where conflicts do not become armed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; conflicts too often.  Calling names is even weaker than using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; inapplicable analogies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, tell me this: Why do you think centralized control is so godawful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important? It should be pretty emminently accepted by now that centralizing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control of anything tends to cause more abuse and violation of trust than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decentralization. My analogy holds, because there is little difference between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialized law, socialized medicine, socialized employment, or socialized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything. You ought to be smart enough to see that.
</EM><BR>
<P>First, who said I do think it is so important (godawful or otherwise)? 
<BR>
I think overarching agreements that covered all parties are very
<BR>
important to peaceful and dependable cooperative actions and recourse
<BR>
when agreements are not met.  Generally, interaction and trade is
<BR>
simplified between parties having in common a set of governing
<BR>
principles and remedies.  If there are more autonomous groups involved
<BR>
then negotiations between members of those groups must gross a divide
<BR>
where there are relatively few such commonalities.  It tends towards
<BR>
making interaction between individuals of two differently governed
<BR>
(contracted law and enforcement) parties more complex somewhat
<BR>
analagously to internationa versus domestic law.   
<BR>
<P>You are to be smart enough to stop telling me that I ought to be smart
<BR>
enough to think like you about this matter.  Why are you using
<BR>
bullying/shaming type techniques?
