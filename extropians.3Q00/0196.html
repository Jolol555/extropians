<P>I do.

<P><EM>&gt; Do you agree that these instincts are built into their

<EM>&gt; brains by DNA?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but most aren't as high-level as &quot;big antlers&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So why can't there also be instincts to want to have sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with big antlers?
</EM><BR>
<P>Encoding &quot;big antlers&quot; is more like encoding symphonies in
<BR>
heartbeats than encoding a heart, and to do that you have to
<BR>
know a lot about the heart and a lot about music.  A useful
<BR>
mutation occurring within the brain (at that level) has to
<BR>
be at least several orders of magnitude less likely than in
<BR>
organs, limbs, and so on.  (And impossible if you think the
<BR>
brain is just one big &quot;pattern catcher&quot;.)
