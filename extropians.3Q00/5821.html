One of the problems with software development is that these
<BR>
newfangled GUIs offer very few useful abstractions.  For
<BR>
example, I have low-level access to input devices.
<BR>
Generally you use the (x, y) coords of the mouse and some
<BR>
sort of &quot;if left-mouse-button down&quot; conditional.  The
<BR>
keyboard is similarly &quot;low level&quot;, with your program
<BR>
capturing key presses.  This is a dumb way to handle input
<BR>
devices for two reasons: it's more work for the programmer
<BR>
and it encourages modal and inconsistent interface design.
<BR>
Window-level control is similarly low level; whoever allowed
<BR>
programmers to gain focus should be shot.  The person who
<BR>
decided that applications get any control over window
<BR>
management whatsoever should be forced to stand behind him.
<BR>
It'd also be nice to see languages that are better adjusted
<BR>
to their environments -- &quot;if (user-input)&quot; should be enough
<BR>
information to display an appropriate user interface without
<BR>
having to mess around setting up widgets, making them
<BR>
visible, and so on.
