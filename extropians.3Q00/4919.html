<EM>&gt; Well, I don't think you do it with rational arguments and science. Probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you need to use a purpose built dogmatic doctrine, designed to basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep these people feel calm and comfortable. A purpose built religion would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do a good job, although we are not really in the business of religion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Better to create a startup venture, new economy style, by partnering with an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; established religion; maybe one of the older versions of Xtianity which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering declining numbers. We could work with some mainstream religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scholars to put a high-tech twist on Jesus' better stuff, and turn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; armageddon into a singularity in messianic clothing. It could possibly go a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long way, and I bet you'd get some funding (corporate?) to help build such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an institution.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think the religion is a goer myself. All this marketting guff is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific enough; people want something solid to believe, something which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tells them what clothes to wear when they get out of bed in the morning, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best way to brush their teeth, what side of the street to walk on. A manual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the right way to live your life. It's doable.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I hate myself. Aargh. But this is, like, a joke, you know?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Careful.  Remember what happened with a certain other created religion:
<BR>
Scientology is not our friend.
<BR>
<P>That being said...perhaps there is possibility in this.  There are
<BR>
priests of major religions who grow weary of what they and their flocks
<BR>
see as increasingly incorrect or irrelevant proclamations from those
<BR>
above them, who may well be open to preaching the truths of our secular
<BR>
world as divine truths.  The field may be ripe for a meme that
<BR>
understanding ourselves and the universe is God's will, such that we
<BR>
might better act as agents of the Diety's desires, and that we might
<BR>
better understand the Diety's desires.  Perhaps also a meme that our
<BR>
understanding of holy wishes is evolving: in biblical times, we thought
<BR>
that slavery was ok, but now we understand that it is not...so, which of
<BR>
our current practices are incorrect?  Perhaps we can partially tell what
<BR>
is true and right from what works; if something is systematically
<BR>
broken, might that not be a sign that something is wrong either with the
<BR>
implementation or the basic concept?
<BR>
<P>Mankind has the ability to think.  If some supernatural force caused
<BR>
homo sapiens to evolve this ability for a reason - and if one is willing
<BR>
to believe in heavenly guidance, this becomes quite plausible - then is
<BR>
it not quite likely that we were intended to *use* this ability to the
<BR>
best of our capability?
