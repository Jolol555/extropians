<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm not sure what you mean by &quot;mirror&quot; ... why is it necessary and
<BR>
why must emotional interaction be the only means to achieve it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4. Acting as a predator makes real emotional interaction impossible, as one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has to conceal part of ones nature and this required putting a conceptual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process into the loop, defeating the epistemological purpose - perceptually 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reaffirming the nature of one's consciousness.  (This is one of the base 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons polygraphs work - and why we place such an extravagent value on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things like love.)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i always thought polygraphs work because human brains are running
<BR>
buggy ware. as to the &quot;epistomological purpose,&quot; what confirmation have i
<BR>
that it is as fundamental as you claim?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5. Any smart conscious being is capable of figuring this out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Therefore, if the SI is conscious, we probably don't have to worry - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although I would want to have a serious talk with it on this very subject 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before I put it on line.  A very smart, non-conscious SI is another matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm not very smart, so i have yet to figure this out; and i
<BR>
suspect there are many like me.
