<P>
Great idea Emlyn, and I'm glad to see this idea pop up again.
<BR>
<P>Way back in 1988, I came up with a similar idea which I actually managed
<BR>
to code to some completion.  I wrote it in BASIC!  The game was of
<BR>
course text based and single player only.  Here was my game:
<BR>
<P>You first entered your name, your location and the date.   The game then
<BR>
started with you sitting at the computer playing this 'stupid' game.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Your mission if you choose to accept it is to make it the center of the
<BR>
galaxy.  Better get up and start making a difference! &quot;
<BR>
<P>The idea was to reach the center of the galaxy with the necessary
<BR>
technology to enter the black hole that lies there and escape into
<BR>
another, perhaps higher dimensional universe.  Much of the game was
<BR>
inspired by Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson, who I read avidly
<BR>
back then while 'altered'.
<BR>
<P>The smart player soon realized that two things would be essential to
<BR>
making it, extending your life (cryonics, nanotechnology), and living
<BR>
long enough to experience and use the very advanced technologies
<BR>
necessary to get you there.
<BR>
<P>**The dynamics of the game and scenarios you encountered were determined
<BR>
in large part by a cellular automata 'agents'.  Meaning what you did in
<BR>
once scene effected the entire game world in subtle and sometimes
<BR>
dramatic ways.  I programmed &quot;butterfly&quot; effects throughout the entire
<BR>
game.  That way every person who played had a different set of
<BR>
circumstances in which to use and dodge to obtain the ultimate goal of
<BR>
the game - living long enough to make it to the center of the galaxy.
<BR>
<P>The games biggest limitations was the overall size of the game world,
<BR>
which was limited almost entirely by the amount of time and energy I was
<BR>
willing to build it.
<BR>
<P>I never published the game to my discontent.  But I was able to share it
<BR>
on several BBS's at the time.
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
<P>Paul Hughes
