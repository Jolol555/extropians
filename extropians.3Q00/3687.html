&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FURTHER CONFIRMATION OF &quot;GOOD SHOT&quot; ON WACO SWAT TAPE
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 8/28/00 Ian Williams Goddard
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 4th I posted an audio file from a videotape
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made by a member of the FBI SWAT team at a sniper nest
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside Mount Carmel in Waco on the day that Mt Carmel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burned down (<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.htm</A>).
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cameraman is a couple hundred yards from Mt Carmel.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tape, as you watch Mt Carmel burn a gunshot sound
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is heard followed by voices near the camera that appear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to say &quot;Good shot?&quot; followed by &quot;A good shot!&quot; This may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be a snipper asking his spotter if his shot hit a target
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed by the spotter confirming it was &quot;a good shot.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I posted that audio I contacted Mark Swett. [1]
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swett is one of the people who transcribed audio tapes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from bugs planted inside Mt Carmel. His transcriptions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suggest that the Davidians started the fire. About the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;good shot&quot; audio track, Mark reported the following:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I picked up five shots. The beginning of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audio has what may be a shot that I include in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the five - most in the distance, but one towards
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the end is closer to the video mic. The dialogue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sounds like 'good shot' followed by 'good try.'&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straightforward interpretation of men near the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;camera saying &quot;Good shot ... Good try&quot; is basically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same as their saying &quot;Good shot? ... A good shot!&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the exception that in the first case the shot was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a miss. Both interpretations suggest a scene where men
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are shooting at targets and commenting on the accuracy
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the shots. About another audio clip from the same
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWAT-team tape, [2] Mark Swett offered this analysis:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I picked up six shots. The dialogue sounds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like 'Bullseye' twice followed by 'ha-ha-ha.'
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last portion is heard as 'good hit.'&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found possible evidence of Davidian culpability in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his analysis of the Mt Carmel audio tapes, nobody could
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rightfully suggest Swett hears what he wants to hear due
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to an anti-government bias, and the easiest explanation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for what he and others of us hear is that the voices are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some men a couple hundred yards from Mt Carmel shooting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at targets and commenting on the accuracy of the shots.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if Swett's hearing of gunshots further and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closer is accurate, a possible interpretation is that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all shots heard can be attributed to coming from one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location, such as Mt Carmel, and thus they may be either
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a long-range gunfight or shots from several sniper nests.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF SWAT-TAPE AUDIO
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the majority of respondents agree that they hear
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good shot,&quot; someone suggested that the two statements
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are &quot;I been shot&quot; followed by &quot;I've been shot.&quot; The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second statement can sound like that if you listen with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that in mind. However, after using the &quot;noise reduction&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function in the Goldwave.com program, [3] I could not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be more sure that it's: &quot;Good shot? ... A good shot!&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big problem with the &quot;I been shot&quot; interpretation
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is explaining why anyone would say that. If it was an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agent joking around after hearing a Davidian gunshot,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no joking quality to the voice. If it was a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person actually being shot, there are no sounds that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow the alleged &quot;I been shot&quot; statements that would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corroborate the hypothesis that someone was shot. One
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might expect to hear agonizing moans or cursing if in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact the speaker had been shot. Instead there is no
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further talking for some time (except as a voice breaks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in over a police-type radio), and when the voices in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the background return, the atmosphere is casual and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you even hear people laughing. Nobody got shot there.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other suggested interpretations are &quot;Got a shot&quot; or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gun shot&quot; instead of &quot;Good shot.&quot; Let me know what
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you hear: <A HREF="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.wav">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/goodshot.wav</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same file with Goldwave.com &quot;noise reduction&quot; applied:

<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HEAR AND SEE THIS WACO EVIDENCE FOR YOURSELF
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently acquired a second VCR so I could fulfill
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several requests for copies of the SWAT-team tape and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Waco FLIR. If you are interested in copies of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waco SWAT-Team video or the Waco FLIR, I can send you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a copy, all I ask is 7 dollars per tape (check or m.o.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Ian Goddard, PO Box 10235, Rockville, MD 20849-0235)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cover all costs. Each tape is approximately an hour.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My master copy of the Waco FLIR is a copy of Davidian
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attorney James Brannon's copy and the visual clarity
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is superior to that seen in any of the popular Waco
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;documentaries. The FLIR covers everything that was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analyzed by Carols Ghigliotti and Dr Edward Allard.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the SWAT-Team tape is of a poor visual
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality and much of it is meaningless footage of cattle
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the countryside around Mt Carmel. The cameraman then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does a tour of the sniper nests on the last day. As Linda
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thompson, who initially acquired the tape, says, there's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot of surprising intelligence on the SWAT-Team tape.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audio files on-line sound as good as on the tape.
