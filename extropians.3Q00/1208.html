<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) As you may have heard Microsoft is trying very much to regain

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Could you cite a reference for this?  (It sounds a bit far-fetched.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Perhaps you mean that they intend to move to an active license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; monitoring system for their software -- i.e. their software comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from their servers when you need it.  This is &quot;software on demand&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or &quot;software rental&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, he means &quot;putting all of their software back into their central
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;servers&quot;.  Yes, it's boneheaded.  Yes, it'd be massively stupid for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;responsible consumers to switch to.  Doesn't mean they ain't gonna try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to get away with it, and doesn't mean a lot of people won't buy it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anyway just because it's &quot;the latest version from Microsoft&quot; (and older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;versions, as always, aren't supported anymore).  Reference what little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*is* known about their .net initiative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The only way you'll be able to use software in the future is by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;logging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in to their system.
</EM><BR>
<P>Noone seems to have noticed that MicroSloth has just apparently monopolized 
<BR>
certain text publication formats.  Yahoo mag mentioned, as I recall, that S. 
<BR>
King could not read his own recently E-published novel on his Mac, as it was 
<BR>
released in an MS proprietary format that required their unlocking reader 
<BR>
software.  Crichton's new book is also supposed to be coming out in this 
<BR>
format.
<BR>
<P>This has been their strategy all along.  Create and patent - or more often 
<BR>
buy up - proprietary formats that force people to use their products.  Give 
<BR>
away Explorer and make sure that all kinds of software plug-ins only work 
<BR>
with it, so then you have to use their OS and then only their software or 
<BR>
software they have a stake in really works well, due to all the hidden hooks 
<BR>
and tricks that only they or their preferred developers get access to.  And 
<BR>
if the LINUX people reverse engineer something, then bury them with 
<BR>
lawsuits.
<BR>
<P>If they can effectively cripple the net by putting so much &quot;essential&quot; stuff 
<BR>
out there that requires you use still more of their proprietary stuff, 
<BR>
ending with you paying rent to get more stuff - that really works for once - 
<BR>
via servers, then we may all ultimately get eaten.
