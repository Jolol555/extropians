&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TWA FLIGHT 800 crash witnesses fed up with the official
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investigation formed the &quot;TWA 800 Eyewitness Alliance,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which published a full-page ad in the Washington Times
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today demanding that the government tell the truth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the crash. In bold-face type they proclaim:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WE SAW TWA FLIGHT 800 SHOT DOWN BY MISSILES
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND WE WON'T BE SILENCED ANY LONGER
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... We, the eyewitnesses know that missiles were involved.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't know who launched them, but we know that for some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason our government has lied and tried to discredit all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of us to keep that question from being addressed. ... The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claim that our evidence is worthless is false and we want
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to know who is behind it. Hundreds of us SAW what happened.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FBI, the CIA and the NTSB must not be allowed to get
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away with this cover-up by defamation of the eyewitnesses.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=======================================================
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Full Ad: <A HREF="http://TWA800.com/images/times-8-15-00.gif">http://TWA800.com/images/times-8-15-00.gif</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=======================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: It's funny how the media and assorted defenders of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the official investigation tried to lead folks to believe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that those of us who were trying to make witness accounts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known were misrepresenting the accounts by our suggesting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the witnesses saw or even thought they saw a missile.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another defense of officialdom to the scrap heap.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shortly after the crash, after I'd interviewed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several witnesses that I realized there was something
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here. Each of these people who I contacted based on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their names reported in the media was telling me about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same thing, about a rocket that rose from a low
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elevation fairly close to shore and that flew out to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sea, headed south, trailing smoke in its path. That
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flight path was at 90 degrees to Flight 800's path,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so it could not be Flight 800. The rocket ended in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a small explosion -- the initial crash event. When
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accumulated all witness accounts from which a line-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of-sight could be established, I found that the rocket
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they observed came from the same area, and the area
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was not the same as the crash. I then triangulated those
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accounts <A HREF="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/witness.gif">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/witness.gif</A> . Even
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the accounts from which reliable line-of-sight could not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be established were looking in the same general area. Not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long thereafter retired Navy crash investigator Commander
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Donaldson published his own triangulation of many
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more accounts than I had and his were based on interviews
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on location. His triangulated close-to-shore launch site
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is almost the same, one or two miles off my triangulation:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://twa800.com/images/triangulation_update.gif">http://twa800.com/images/triangulation_update.gif</A> With the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release of the NTSB report we discovered that the FBI had
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also triangulated missile-witness accounts and the FBI had
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;triangulated accounts to virtually the same close-to-shore
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location both Donaldson and I independently determined:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.twa800.com/images/fbi_triangle.gif">http://www.twa800.com/images/fbi_triangle.gif</A> . These
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accounts are a human recording of what happened.
