<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Does anyone know about fire engines?  Those arent diesel, surely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passenger vehickles are diesel.
</EM><BR>
<P>That surprises me.  A fire engine must be ready to make peak power within
<BR>
seconds of being fired up, which I woulda thought incompatible with
<BR>
warming up glow plugs and gallons of oil.  Thanks for the info, tho.
<BR>
Now I wanna find out how a fire engine manages to do its thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I have a notion about hybrid technology for an 18 wheeler...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you sound like me....the difference being you know what youre talking about
</EM><BR>
<P>You are too kind.  Im surprised it doesnt already exist.  I need to do
<BR>
a search on the web.  Ill get back with you on that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I LOVE the idea of hybrid electric.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me too, ever since I first learned how little power it takes to
<BR>
cruise the average family car at freeway speeds and how much
<BR>
expensive fuel is wasted sitting in traffic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  It seems so unweildy to carry a trany, drive shaft..a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differential...another drive shaft ...ANOTHER differential...
</EM><BR>
<P>Especially a tranny capable of carrying the amount of torque
<BR>
your rig makes.  That piece of equipment alone would be
<BR>
(I think) heavier than the batteries needed for a hybid truck.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And then there's the brakes...THREE braking systems....and what does it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do?....it changes kinetic energy to heat....HEAT...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, two of em make heat.  Your Jacobs system converts money
<BR>
directly into noise...  {8^D
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; gotta burn more (increasingly expensive) fuel.  With a Hybrid electric rig
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would seem possible to use regenerative braking ....
</EM><BR>
<P>Possible yes, even encouraged.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My rig isn't all that quick to accelerate....0 to 60 in fifteen minutes is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriate...
</EM><BR>
<P>Again its because the trucker must churn thru all those gears.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; .it's claim to fame is continuous, long term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pulling......running a diesel for days at a time without ever shutting it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off is common...
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure but electric motors would do the same, would they not?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Have you considered a fuel cell?  Will a fuel cell run off ethanol?
</EM><BR>
<P>Current ones will if you have access to liquid oxygen.  You can
<BR>
be sure tho, smart guys are working like madmen trying to get
<BR>
a alcohol/air burner.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Good plan....but it ain't gonna work.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AlGore and Shrub are both politicians.....all theyre looking for is to GET
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; elected...then all of a sudden their priorities change...
</EM><BR>
<P>Everett, you're more cynical that even *I* am.  {8^D  But think it over.
<BR>
Algore or Ralphy-boy could sell the notion like viagra:  &quot;Citizens!  Lets
<BR>
heeeeeelp the hard working professional drivers clean up all those
<BR>
smoke belching trucks, these sturdy machines that bring foooood to our
<BR>
taaables.  Lets improooove the air that weee and our children breeeathe...&quot;
<BR>
<P>Cant ya just see one of our illustrious politicos speechifying this?  Hell,
<BR>
even *I* would vote for something like that, even if it costs me money.
