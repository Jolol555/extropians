<P>Hi Steve &amp; welcome,
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Has anyone ever tried to build a machine which could take a lego object,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and build a copy? Or duplicate an object in any similarly constrained
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design/manufacturing environment?
</EM><BR>
<P>There are &quot;rough&quot; matter compilers that exist today under the heading
<BR>
of &quot;rapid prototyping&quot; machines.  They basically use lasers to photo-cure
<BR>
a light sensitive plastic in the exact shape/form of the part you need.
<BR>
There are also 3D scanners that can read the shape of an object and
<BR>
drive the laser.  So replicating at least the size and shape of something
<BR>
like a lego can be done now.  It only works for plastic parts though which
<BR>
limits the applications.
<BR>
<P>The problem is to get it to be self-bootstrapping -- i.e. you would like
<BR>
the read &amp; write machinery to be constructed entirely out of components
<BR>
that could be manufactured using the read and write machinery.  That
<BR>
currently is not the case (lasers and computers for the most part are
<BR>
not made out of plastic).
<BR>
<P>I've discussed this with Robert Freitas regarding the original NASA
<BR>
study (which he co-authored) involving self-replicating factories on
<BR>
the moon.  The question was --
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why is nanotech better than self-replicating macro-tech
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g. the moon factory)?&quot;
<BR>
His succinct answer was:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The parts count is lower.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The problem isn't that self-replicating macro-scale machines
<BR>
are impossible.  The problem is that the design challenges are
<BR>
formidable because the parts count is so high.  (Imagine
<BR>
designing a milling machine that can produce all the parts
<BR>
*in* the milling machine).  As I've discussed on the list months
<BR>
ago (see the archives), you also run into the economic problem of
<BR>
having &quot;factory factory&quot;.  Given the exponential growth in supply that
<BR>
may allow, no sane businessperson would view the design of a &quot;factory
<BR>
factory&quot; as an investment likely to provide a good ROI.  (Everyone
<BR>
who buys your product becomes your competitor.)  My conclusion
<BR>
was that only governments or highly committed groups with large
<BR>
resources at their disposal could consider the development of
<BR>
&quot;factory factories&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Hope that answers some of the questions.
<BR>
<P>Robert
