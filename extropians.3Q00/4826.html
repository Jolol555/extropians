<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Not such a big deal but our tax dollars are supporting such &quot;art.&quot;  Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  course, this goes for genuine art too.  I don't think anyone should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  forced to support it.  And for those who might think I lack compassion 
</EM><BR>
here,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I not only buy art (from prints to CDs to poetry books), I do frequent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  museums, theaters, cinemas, galleries, and concerts.  So I support it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  already.  I also see lots of other people doing the same.  Granted, I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  feeding starving artists, but I do my part.  Nothing to brag about, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  trying to disarm the highly vocal libertarian-bashers.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>Golly Gee Billy Bob, is that ther plaster mule a piece of Gen-yoo-ine Art?
<BR>
<P><P>Basher though you think I be, my tax dollars do not support much of the art 
<BR>
these days, believe me.  The plug has been pulled. Educational art programs?  
<BR>
yes. Community Outreach programs for impoverished youth? OK. Inner city 
<BR>
revitalization through public performance? Sure... (If its generously matched 
<BR>
by ten thousand dollars from Sprint, Dole, Citicorp, Budwieser and the 
<BR>
Amanson Foundation). But art as Art?  Artists making Art? Money for an 
<BR>
ack-tchoo-al artiste, paid to create? noooo....
<BR>
Not any more. 
<BR>
<P>And art is the better for it, IMHO. If I think YOU have a narrow idea of what 
<BR>
&quot;genuine art&quot; is- imagine what I think of the NEA's ever narrowing, narrow 
<BR>
viewpoint!
<BR>
Urk. 
<BR>
<P>I don't feel forced to pay taxes, I like paying taxes, I like to live in my 
<BR>
world of free busses, free roads, free schools, good security and public 
<BR>
parks and beaches.
<BR>
Money well spent. I wish I could put more of it towards sculpture gardens 
<BR>
instead of guns. 
<BR>
Hey ... but I don't feel that in REALITY Art benefits from National money, in 
<BR>
fact in it's heyday the NEA seemed to generate worse art each year. 
<BR>
Eventually the system bottomed out and shit hit the fan with the NEA four. If 
<BR>
you want MY take on that, e-mail me privately, since it involves people I 
<BR>
know.
<BR>
<P>FYI: Most of the money for public art comes from private funding. Rich folks. 
<BR>
Philanthropically minded folks with more money to spend than they know how to 
<BR>
spend it.  Only a tiny bit of the money comes from your taxes (assuming you 
<BR>
live in the United States) and 99% of 1999 endowments for the arts was 
<BR>
directly from grants: Corporate funders, family trusts, estate endowments and 
<BR>
the like. 
<BR>
<P>They are less controlling than Uncle Sam, but not by much.
