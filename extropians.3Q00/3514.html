<P>Well, yes, Nadia, but--
<BR>
<P>Take a look at the places around the world where religious devotees do
<BR>
vigorously dispute with each other. They don't engage in polite
<BR>
discussions, they hack off limbs, blow each other up, teach their children
<BR>
insane hatred. Obviously some of this is territorial defence/aggression
<BR>
under an ideological mask, but a lot of it probably has to do with the way
<BR>
religion enters into one's very definition of self and extended kin, of
<BR>
deep-set die-for values. So there's a lot to be said for polite mutual
<BR>
live&amp;let live tolerance. In such a framework, you often find that the
<BR>
overpowering intensity of irrational memes falls away, since their immune
<BR>
defences aren't under invigorating threat. I escaped from Catholicism
<BR>
because I was living in relaxed, multicultural Australia; if I'd been
<BR>
raised in Northern Ireland, I'm not sure it would have been so
<BR>
(comparatively) easy.
