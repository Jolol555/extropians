<P>I have been thinking about this in the context of these big forest fires we
<BR>
have had in the US.  The problem is that if you suppress natural fires the
<BR>
forest becomes congested with small trees and downed fuel until hot dry
<BR>
weather conditions foster a conflagration that cannot be suppressed.  People
<BR>
want to live in and near these forests, so just letting nature take its
<BR>
course is reasonable only in the remote areas.  So I was thinking that the
<BR>
populated areas could use a army of gastrobots that would go out and &quot;eat&quot;
<BR>
the downed fuel and crowded small trees.
<BR>
<P>However, I realize that this not too practical given the scale of the task,
<BR>
and that it is best to wait for nanotechnology.  With MNT you could have
<BR>
swarms of flying insect like devices that are always out there doing the job
<BR>
that fire would do, but also returning clean burning fuel and other cyclic
<BR>
materials (hydrocarbons).  Just the same, I like the idea of sending
<BR>
gastrobots out there as a starting point on the development line (less scary
<BR>
to the public than GM carpenter ants or termites).
