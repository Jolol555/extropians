Research in the 1960's-1990's on particle beams for space weaponry (Strategic
<BR>
Defense Initiative) was not able to solve the problems of beam dispersion and
<BR>
beam deflection (due to magnetic fields, photon pressure, solar wind). Lasers
<BR>
and kinetic-kill vehicles are currently considered more feasible.

Ultracold Matter Beam Generators
<BR>
<P>Abstract
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advent of laser cooling and manipulation of diffuse, ultracold matter
<BR>
will find many kinds of applications in space exploration and development. Near
<BR>
and mid-term possibilities include the shipment of streams of ultracold gas or
<BR>
its condensate
<BR>
<P>[Condensation into microclusters would occur in free space downrange of the
<BR>
launcher, in effect increasing the ballistic coefficient.]
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;over distances of hundreds or perhaps millions of kilometers, the formation of
<BR>
artificial aerobraking corridors and beam propulsion for micro and
<BR>
nanospacecraft.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several designs for &quot;Ultracold Matter Beam Generators&quot; are proposed
<BR>
specifically for, though not limited to, use on the Lunar surface for launching
<BR>
material into space, for providing an &quot;Artificial Reentry Corridor&quot;, and for
<BR>
matter beam propulsion. Designs variants include a laser-cooled thermal jet
<BR>
based on recent experiments, a laser-accelerated and cooled beam, and a
<BR>
laser-cooled, neutralized ion beam based on current ion thrusters. The equipment
<BR>
for a commercially viable device might be quite compact, with characteristic
<BR>
barrel lengths on the order of one meter. The generated atomic or molecular beam
<BR>
may have an initial launch temperature in the millikelvin range or lower. A
<BR>
launch velocity of 1-10 km/sec would then give a matter beam dispersion on the
<BR>
order of a milliradian or less- the central issue of propagating a particle beam
<BR>
in free space. A higher launch velocity would of course reduce this dispersion.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its introduction in the late 1970's, laser cooling and trapping has
<BR>
made some very impressive advances in fields as diverse as high-resolution
<BR>
spectroscopy, atomic-transition timekeeping, atom interferometry atom
<BR>
lithography reflecting and imaging atomic beams, the formation and
<BR>
characterization of optical lattices, and the creation of a heretofore
<BR>
theoretical state of matter- the Bose-Einstein Condensate  and its associated
<BR>
&quot;atom laser&quot;. Materials used to date for ultracold atom beams and traps include
<BR>
isotopes of Na, Cs, Rb, Cr, He, Ne, Ar, Xe, atomic H, and Al. There do not
<BR>
appear to be any serious proposals to date to develop this class of technology
<BR>
for space applications.  
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reference design of one gram per second launched at a nominal 2 km/sec is
<BR>
used for comparison between different systems and for feasibility studies. Two
<BR>
solutions are explored in more depth, the laser cooled thermal beam and the
<BR>
laser-cooled, neutralized ion beam.
<BR>
=======
<BR>
<P>Example application:
<BR>
=======
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ion beam source such as the 30 cm NASA NSTAR xenon ion thruster might serve
<BR>
as the first stage of a neutral atom beam for small spacecraft. The cooling and
<BR>
velocity leveling would require at least three separate laser systems and
<BR>
associated sidebands to operate on transitions of singly and doubly charged ions
<BR>
as well as neutral atoms. It may be more cost effective to magnetically divert
<BR>
and discard the doubly charges species. The use of a noble element is
<BR>
particularly appealing as it won't plate out onto the accelerated spacecraft.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nominal thrust of 93 mN at 2.3 kW input power might produce a collimated
<BR>
beam force of 50 mN after cooling and jet losses. A beam-propelled
<BR>
nanospacecraft would consist of a pusher plate or solar sail [65], attitude
<BR>
control system and payload, with or without its own rocket engine and
<BR>
propellant. A single 30 cm thruster for example, producing a nominal 50 mN beam
<BR>
of variable Isp (to provide a constant relative beam velocity), operating over a
<BR>
100 km distance, could add a DV of about 3 km/sec to a one gram spacecraft in
<BR>
about one minute. This is also dependent on the intercepted fraction of the beam
<BR>
as well as the fraction of momentum transferred to the spacecraft [67], which
<BR>
can be larger or smaller than unity.
