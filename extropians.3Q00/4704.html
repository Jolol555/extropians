<P>&lt;&lt; Yes. Name the free market corporation that was in charge of their

persecution. &gt;&gt;

Retro: ever hear of I.G. Farben during WW2? Or the Belgian Gold Minning 
<BR>
companies in the 19th century Congo? Or the 4000 dead in accidents like in 
<BR>
Bhopal back in the 1980's? On the other hand these capitalists wouldn't have 
<BR>
succeeded if not for Governments. Yet, The Adolph Hitler Fund, was supported 
<BR>
from 1929-1945 by Krupp, and Messerschmidt, and so forth. The year 1929, 
<BR>
rather then the start of WW2 (1939) is accurate as far as I have been able to 
<BR>
tell. The German capitalists switched their funding from Von Pappen's 
<BR>
Race-Nationalist's The National Partei to Hitler's National Socialists after 
<BR>
1926, all secretly of course. Anyway, yes governments kill 100000 times more 
<BR>
then capitalists ever did. But be warned, the two  work together.
