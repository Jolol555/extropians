You have not really articulated how a free market is any worse for the
<BR>
&quot;little guy&quot; than the existsing systems, which trample on the &quot;little guy&quot;
<BR>
as much as any system ever did.  As has been mentioned by others, in some
<BR>
ways, the old feudal system was actually less abusive of the &quot;little guy&quot;
<BR>
than the current system.  At least with a free market everyone will
<BR>
benefit from a strong economy.
