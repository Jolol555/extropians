In a long response to Samantha Atkins on this thread, Emlyn concluded with:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As an aside, I think it's funny that transhumanism, which purports to being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about moving away from humanity, is actually more about what it is,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fundamentally, to be human, than any other belief system/philosophy/vision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I can think of. Its about us merging more fully with our tools,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believing more strongly in our ability to reshape the universe, believing
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt;ourselves rather than some unknowable greater force(s). What is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;essentially human, than the intimate relationship we have with our tools,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and our desire to reshape our environment using them? To lose that focus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and that ability, makes us less human; so to strengthen it, makes us more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so. The posthumans of our vision, supposedly having left humanity behind,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be paradoxically, maximally human. Possibly not organic, but 100%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;natural, certainly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Emlyn, although I am only quoting the final paragraph of your message, I
<BR>
consider the message as a whole to be your best, most direct and
<BR>
comprehensive statement in this discussion. I think - no, I know - that we
<BR>
are in greater agreement than I had previously recognized. Leaving aside the
<BR>
god-talk for the moment, and focusing on the human part of Transhumanism, I
<BR>
see that what we have each been saying in our own way is that we wish for
<BR>
the best within us to be increased, maximized and extended into some form
<BR>
that is more long-lived and altogether greater than we are now. Yet at the
<BR>
same time, the essence of what we are now will not be changed.
<BR>
<P>Some would call this essence &quot;mind,&quot; or &quot;spirit,&quot; or &quot;Consciousness.&quot;
<BR>
Whether that human essence is empowered to fantastic levels or becomes
<BR>
something as ethereal as electrical patterns uploaded into a Supercomputing
<BR>
Object really does not matter. Call it a god or a guy, it's still one of us.
<BR>
<P>My use of the g-d word in this discussion seems to have been a tactical
<BR>
error on my part, as it pressed the emotional buttons of too many people. I
<BR>
would have been well advised to speak of Powers and potential so as not to
<BR>
offend atheist sensibilities.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
<P>Michael LaTorra
