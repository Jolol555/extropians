<P>
I just read this article by Robert X. Cringley:
<BR>
<P>Original Article: <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20000713.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Very Creepy.
<BR>
<P>This scene of the skeptical Kirk flashed in my mind this week as I
<BR>
read about Carnivore, the FBI's system for reading the e-mail of bad
<BR>
guys. Carnivore is a sealed box that is installed at the network
<BR>
operations center of an Internet Service Provider. It filters packets,
<BR>
finds e-mail going to and from identified criminals, and saves that
<BR>
e-mail for later decryption and analysis. What bothers the Internet
<BR>
Service Providers is they have no control over the Carnivore box,
<BR>
and no way of protecting the privacy of all the customers who aren't
<BR>
drug lords or escaped felons. What bothers the American Civil
<BR>
Liberties Union is the likelihood that individuals will not only lose
<BR>
their
<BR>
right to privacy, but lose it in a new and insidious way.
<BR>
<P>What bothers me is the damned box. Why would the FBI need a
<BR>
box? Here's all the FBI will say about Carnivore. It sits on the
<BR>
network at the ISP, is PC-based, is &quot;a kind of a sniffer,&quot; identifies
<BR>
and saves packets associated with suspected criminals, is installed
<BR>
under a court order, and doesn't itself act as a decryption device.
<BR>
There are supposed to be around 20 Carnivore boxes, and they
<BR>
have been in use since early this year. You don't need a sealed box
<BR>
to do any of these tasks, most of which are already being done for
<BR>
completely legal reasons right inside the router at every ISP.
<BR>
Routers look at every packet, determine what type of packet it is,
<BR>
where it is coming from and where it is going to, then the router
<BR>
delivers the packet to its intended destination. This is what routers
<BR>
&nbsp;do. Adding the Carnivore task is a simple matter of blind copying
<BR>
every packet to or from a bad guy to a third address at the J. Edgar
<BR>
Hoover FBI Building in Washington, DC. It's at most a few lines of
<BR>
code and requires no additional hardware.
<BR>
<P>So why the box?
<BR>
<P>The probable reason is because cops like to be in control. They
<BR>
LIKE boxes, like delivering them in unmarked cars, like the satisfying
<BR>
click of the RJ-45 connector as it slides home. Maybe they don't
<BR>
know that it could all be done without a box. Heck, it IS being done
<BR>
without a box all the time, and that's where the ACLU is missing the
<BR>
point. Sniffers have been running on networks ever since Harry Saal
<BR>
invented the device. Every packet at every ISP already goes through
<BR>
a sniffer at least part of the time. An ISP could do at any time what
<BR>
we fear the FBI might do with Carnivore read the e-mail and follow
<BR>
the surfing habits of every pretty blonde customer. Good ISPs,
<BR>
which is to say nearly all ISPs don't do this, of course, but it
<BR>
happens.
<BR>
<P>So why doesn't the FBI just get a court order making the ISP do the
<BR>
dirty work? That's what the ISPs wonder, too, especially since that's
<BR>
how phone taps are handled. Cops don't really climb poles and
<BR>
attach alligator clips to hear phone calls. That's all done at the
<BR>
central office by telephone company technicians.
<BR>
<P>The FBI, through the use of Carnivore, is trying to grab a little more
<BR>
power. And by doing it themselves with Carnivore, the FBI doesn't
<BR>
have to reveal the identity of the bad guy or extent to which it is
<BR>
using the box. Yeah, right.
<BR>
<P>But wait, it gets worse. There are aspects of this case that the
<BR>
ACLU hasn't even considered. The Carnivore boxes are what's
<BR>
called &quot;co-located&quot; at the ISP. This isn't a rare thing. Many
<BR>
organizations like to control their own Web or mail servers and so
<BR>
co-locate them at an ISP. Colocation puts your server closer to the
<BR>
Internet backbone, eliminates typical T-1 line costs, allows the ISP
<BR>
to monitor and reboot the server, and usually comes with nifty things
<BR>
like redundant backbone connections and diesel generators in case
<BR>
the power goes out. Companies in the co-location business include
<BR>
well-known names like AT&amp;T, IBM, and Intel. So there are tens of
<BR>
thousands -- maybe hundreds of thousands -- of computers already
<BR>
installed just like the FBI installs its Carnivore boxes. What keeps
<BR>
those co-located computers from being sniffers, too? Nothing at all.
<BR>
For $300 per month, you too could install your own Carnivore box at
<BR>
the ISP of your choice. Co-location facilities don't really care what
<BR>
you do with your co-located server as long as you keep paying the
<BR>
bill.
<BR>
<P>More technically astute readers may take exception to this idea of
<BR>
private Carnivore boxes since there are ways to isolate ISP traffic
<BR>
and keep one box from seeing all the packets on the ISP network.
<BR>
But at most ISPs, THOSE TECHNIQUES AREN'T USED.
<BR>
<P>This still leaves us wondering why the FBI insists on this program
<BR>
that isn't really necessary to do what they say they want to do.
<BR>
Beyond my overzealous cop theory, the most obvious possibility is
<BR>
that Carnivore is actually intended to do something else, some
<BR>
different task than the FBI is saying. Privacy advocates and the
<BR>
ACLU seem fixated on the idea that the Feds will use Carnivore to
<BR>
eavesdrop on non-criminals. It makes sense to worry about this,
<BR>
given past FBI anti-privacy campaigns like the Clipper Chip fiasco of
<BR>
several years ago that was supposed to have made it possible for
<BR>
the FBI to tap up to 10 million simultaneous telephone conversations,
<BR>
even though there are only an average of 1500 court-ordered phone
<BR>
taps each year in the U.S.
<BR>
<P>But I have my own theory about Carnivore. From a network
<BR>
architecture standpoint, the best location for Carnivore is right after
<BR>
the ISP's router. This puts Carnivore in the path of every packet
<BR>
entering or leaving the ISP. It's also a major reason why ISPs might
<BR>
not want to install Carnivore boxes -- it's the network's point of
<BR>
greatest vulnerability. In this position, Carnivore can act as a
<BR>
listening and recording device, OR IT CAN ACT AS A SWITCH. If
<BR>
we ever hear a proposal from the FBI in which it plans to install
<BR>
Carnivores at all 6000 ISPs in the U.S., we'll be giving the
<BR>
government the power to do something it can't do right now.
<BR>
