<EM>&gt; As for aging, it seems to me it's always a negative, it's just not negative

<EM>&gt; enough for evolution to change.

<P>Evolution will change the aging program as necessary to optimize reproductive
<BR>
fitness.  Ultimately however, it is very difficult for evolution to produce
<BR>
non-aging organisms.  Doing so requires that you sacrifice reproduction
<BR>
resources for maintenance and repair producing lower fecundity.  To
<BR>
balance this, the non-aging organism has to produce ever increasing numbers
<BR>
of offspring as it gets older (to maintain the fraction of longevity
<BR>
enhancing genes in the gene pool).  [Trees, sturgeon &amp; lobsters for
<BR>
example produce more seeds/eggs as the grow older and get larger.]
<BR>
Eventually the individuals with the longevity promoting genes will
<BR>
encounter the physical or resource limits of the environment (Trees
<BR>
encounter the osmotic pressure water pumping limit on height while
<BR>
animals encouter food limitations).  You can't produce indefinite
<BR>
longevity without an ever increasing fecundity which requires an
<BR>
ever increasing resource base.
<BR>
<P>The net result of this is that it is difficult to impossible for
<BR>
natural evolution to explore the phase space for genes or combinations
<BR>
thereof that would produce indefinately lived species.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A bug will probably get eaten within a year anyway so there's little point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in maintaining the organism so well it could live longer than that, better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to reduce the maintenance budget and increase the reproduction budget and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have lots of offspring.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, evolution has the emphasis first on the survival of the genes.
<BR>
Unfortunately!
