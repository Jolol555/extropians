</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;To carry a lethal weapon, as others have pointed out, means adjusting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;your thought processes to the point where you are prepared to exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;lethal force.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't see the necessity of that relation.  One might be quite willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; carry a lethal weapon and yet be quite unwilling to use it.  By far the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; majority of defensive uses of firearms involve mere brandishing them.  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suffices to give the impression that you can and will use deadly force.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I tend to agree with Michael Lorrey here:  &quot;Any weapon you carry you MUST be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to use. Visualize using in various circumstances. Determine what are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appropriate weapons for you, what you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfortable with, and under what circumstances.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are truly unwilling to use a weapon, but want it simply to scare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people away, why not load it with blanks?  You just don't fool around with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this kind of sh!t in my opinion.
</EM><BR>
<P>While this may work in some instances, I don't recommend you do it with, say, a
<BR>
revolver, where the perp can see that you have blanks. I also would not use them
<BR>
for the simple fact that a perp with a gun is going to shoot back, and blanks
<BR>
won't help you then. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;impersonal and hard-hearted?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; To the contrary, I would argue that a person unwilling to conceive of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deadly force in defense of self and loved ones lacks both self-regard and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; callous attitude toward the very people who most deserve protection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You should read Hal's post again, because this is -not- what he's talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about.  The issue at hand is the repercussions to one's dealings with others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon making the specific decision to carry, and use, deadly force.  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a discussion regarding someone's inability to &quot;_conceive_ of using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deadly force in defense of self and loves ones&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>The repercussions he is implying is, for example, that you won't be able to
<BR>
empathize with your wife after killing someone who was attempting to rape her,
<BR>
etc.. Frankly, I would expect one's wife to fail to empathize with you if you
<BR>
refused to kill someone who was attempting to rape her.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Imagine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a father who says, &quot;Oh, my, no!  I would not shoot someone even if it were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the only way to stop them from raping my wife and killing my children!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be so, so . . . cruel!&quot;  I think we would rightly regard that fellow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not just a coward but as morally culpable for failing to shoulder his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; responsibilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I doubt such an impulse stems from cowardice, but you'd be right in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumption that I would find such an individual was critically limited by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rigidity of his moral code.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, he's just a yellow bastard. I don't care if thats his 'moral code'. His
<BR>
moral code is one of rationalizing cowardice. Valuing the life of a criminal
<BR>
over the life of a loved one is cowardly, a mental illness of phobia bordering
<BR>
on psychosis.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Would he nonetheless seem admirably warm-blooded,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; personal, and soft-hearted to Hal?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Admirably?  It's interesting that upon Hal asking the question: &quot;isn't it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible that this psychological adjustment will be damaging to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relationships with other people?&quot;  (a valid and interesting question in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinion,) there have been immediate responses seemingly interpreting his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question as an attack on people who make this adjustment and a resounding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; praise in favor of those who don't-- an interpretation that fails to address
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the central point by virtue of presupposition.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, he is implying that people who kill in self defense will become, mentally
<BR>
deranged, as much as people that murder. There is a significant difference
<BR>
between the two. While there is no doubt that highly stressful situations do
<BR>
have a greater impact in one's memory, the only difference between carrying a
<BR>
gun or not in such situations is that you are more likely to survive the
<BR>
situation to remember it than you are if you are disarmed. Dead men tell no
<BR>
tales.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Instead, we might think about actually applying some thought to the issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For those of you who are interested in doing so, let me proffer the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following questions:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) As best as we are able to determine, by what margin do you increase your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survivability by choosing to train and equip yourself with deadly force?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clearly this number will differ from individual to individual-- but unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we have ninjas or mobsters on this list, I think our relative probabilities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will clump fairly closely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) Choosing to train and equip yourself with deadly force is a powerful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decision with moral implications and necessitates the ability to take a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular type of decisive and permanent action, with real repercussions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are there possible negative side effects to making such a decision?  If so,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is it worth it anyway?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Several list members have already given the impression that they do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe that there are possible negative side effects to making such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decision.  (Maybe there are positive ones!)  That's fine, and we know how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you stand on the issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I tend to disagree.  But first a caveat: unlike some list members, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actually don't associate with very many gun owners, let alone people who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actively carry firearms.  So much of this is pure conjecture.  However, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my limited dealings with those who have inclinations in that direction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (including people on this list,) my impression has been that: as a result of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their decision, the means by which they interact with other people has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; altered in a fashion that I would consider negative-- in some cases, even so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far as to have a direct effect on their survivability, or quality of life.
</EM><BR>
<P>Do you mean they choose to live in a jurisdiction that has fewer high paying
<BR>
jobs because they value their right to defend themselves and their families over
<BR>
purely commercial concerns? Frankly, every state and I've ever been in that
<BR>
tends to the free end of the scale with regards to gun ownership and use tend to
<BR>
have a far higher quality of life than those cities and states on the other end
<BR>
of the scale, so I dissagree with you greatly. Such free jurisdictions also have
<BR>
far lower crime rates on all levels than jurisdictions which restrict gun use,
<BR>
so survivability is also higher with guns than without.
