<P>
I'm sitting here late at night gazing at my unread books, having
<BR>
finished Zubrin's &quot;Entering Space&quot; (very good in those areas where
<BR>
Zubrin confines himself to aerospace engineering, interesting
<BR>
when he crosses over into anthropology or psychology and poor
<BR>
when he gets into areas of the evolution of civilizations --
<BR>
mainly due to the sloppy or minimal treatment of nanotech and AI).
<BR>
<P>I've picked up Energies by Vaclav Smil, MIT Press, 1999, and have
<BR>
been thumbing through it.  It strikes me as a book that most
<BR>
Extropians should read.  Sources, uses and applications of energy
<BR>
are areas that come up frequently for discussion in the list.
<BR>
Fundamentally extropianism must be about the creation and application
<BR>
of energy in controlled ways to combat entropy.
<BR>
<P>Energies is short (~200 pages), contains many interesting tables
<BR>
and graphs and covers a wide range of topics:
<BR>
1) Sun and Earth
<BR>
2) Plants and Animals
<BR>
3) People and Food
<BR>
4) Preindustrial Societies
<BR>
5) Fossil-Fueled Civilization
<BR>
6) Transportation and Information
<BR>
<P>In short it serves as a book that provides you with a lot of
<BR>
information in an easily accessed format that allows you to
<BR>
think creatively about the topics.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, it is dedicated to Philip and Phylis Morrison.
<BR>
