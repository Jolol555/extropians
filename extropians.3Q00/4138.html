<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 30'th update on my fly longevity experiments. In Run #28
<BR>
&nbsp;I tested the effect of various food items on fly longevity.  I also
<BR>
&nbsp;looked at evidence of toxicity of an anti-obesity citrus aurantium
<BR>
&nbsp;extract, which contains 15 mg synephrine.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was somewhat surprising that synephrine was associated with
<BR>
&nbsp;reduced late mortality. I will have to have another look at this in
<BR>
&nbsp;future to see if this advantage was a fluke or not. Coconut juice also
<BR>
&nbsp;looks worth a second look.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early survival was increased notably by propolis by the day 11
<BR>
&nbsp;census, but late survival was actually reduced. The propolis extract also
<BR>
&nbsp;contained 500 mg of rosehips. If propolis/rosehip antioxidants
<BR>
&nbsp;deteriorate in solution, this might account for these effects.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Run #29 I attempted to stabilize proanthocyanidins with copper
<BR>
&nbsp;chelators so that the early survival benefits noted in earlier runs with
<BR>
&nbsp;the grape extract leucoselect, and the pine bark extract pynogenol might
<BR>
&nbsp;be extended in time.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly due to the already excellent short-term survival of the
<BR>
&nbsp;controls, leucoselect did not offer any short term advantage. The higher
<BR>
&nbsp;dosage of pyconogenol did prove to be advantageous, with the usual
<BR>
&nbsp;increase in early survival, paired to a decrease in late survival when
<BR>
&nbsp;the proanthocyanidins have oxidized.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both reservatrol, and rooibos tea can chelate copper. When I added
<BR>
&nbsp;either of these to proanthocyanidin extracts there was a minor benefit on
<BR>
&nbsp;survival. When used by itself rooibos tea (1 bag/cup water) yielded the
<BR>
&nbsp;best overall survival this time around. In future I will have to try
<BR>
&nbsp;resveratrol by itself as well.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a continuation of my cryobiology experimentation, Freezer Run #2
<BR>
&nbsp;tried to confirm the earlier benefit noted for pycnogenol at a dosage of
<BR>
&nbsp;200 mg.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pycnogenol at the 200 mg dosage proved a bust this time, but doubling
<BR>
&nbsp;the dose to 400 mg appeared to slow freezing damage. This is just
<BR>
&nbsp;interesting enough that yet another experiment will be needed to
<BR>
&nbsp;determine if pynogenol feeding really protects flies from freezing
<BR>
&nbsp;damage.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: The milk bottles were placed on their side in the freezer.
<BR>
&nbsp;Drops of water placed on the milk bottles housing the flies were all
<BR>
&nbsp;frozen after 1 hour, so it looks very likely the flies themselves were
<BR>
&nbsp;also frozen, and not merely supercooled. The flies had been stored for 6
<BR>
&nbsp;days in their respective milk bottles before being placed in the freezer.
<BR>
&nbsp;A few flies had already died in this time, before the freezer experiment
<BR>
&nbsp;started.
