<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by putting all of their software back into their central servers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Could you cite a reference for this?  (It sounds a bit far-fetched.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps you mean that they intend to move to an active license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; monitoring system for their software -- i.e. their software comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; from their servers when you need it.  This is &quot;software on demand&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; or &quot;software rental&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;No, he means &quot;putting all of their software back into their central
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;servers&quot;.  Yes, it's boneheaded.  Yes, it'd be massively stupid for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;responsible consumers to switch to.  Doesn't mean they ain't gonna try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to get away with it, and doesn't mean a lot of people won't buy it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anyway just because it's &quot;the latest version from Microsoft&quot; (and older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;versions, as always, aren't supported anymore).  Reference what little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;*is* known about their .net initiative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only way you'll be able to use software in the future is by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;logging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in to their system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Noone seems to have noticed that MicroSloth has just apparently monopolized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certain text publication formats.  Yahoo mag mentioned, as I recall, that S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; King could not read his own recently E-published novel on his Mac, as it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; released in an MS proprietary format that required their unlocking reader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software.  Crichton's new book is also supposed to be coming out in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; format.
</EM><BR>
<P>really? What format is this? You know, they are not the only company
<BR>
that does this. Corel Ventura 7 &amp; 8 files can only be read on Ventura (a
<BR>
Win only app), even though Corel has its own flavor of linux out on the
<BR>
market. Ventura will not be available on linux for at least another 6-12
<BR>
months. It's not a conspiracy, its called cashflow pipelining.
<BR>
<P>Microsoft, BTW is developing its own Office applications and other apps
<BR>
to work on linux, which the e-book format will work on. The reason it
<BR>
does not work on Mac, and why MS is likely not interested in investing
<BR>
the money in developing a reader for the Mac, is that the current Mac OS
<BR>
is a lame duck. Thats right. The next version of the Mac OS is going to
<BR>
be linux based, and will not run ANY current Mac applications, so there
<BR>
is limited utility in developing new apps that run on the current Mac
<BR>
platform. You Mac users will have to buy all new applications (isn't
<BR>
this the third time that Apple has done this to you Mac users, yet you
<BR>
continue to complain about the *Microsoft* conspiracy/monopoly?). Why
<BR>
should MS pay for developing an app that has at best a one year
<BR>
life/marketability to it?
