<P>
A question: Is it more profitable for the advancement of Extropian ideas
<BR>
and philosophy to adopt an attitude of overly polite conversion first,
<BR>
rather than use language that gets blood pressures rising and minds
<BR>
disengaged?
<BR>
<P>I would argue that a more profitable approach within the goal of getting
<BR>
others to think critically about their held positions and beliefs is to
<BR>
question the source and reasoning first, then move onto stronger
<BR>
language if necessary.
<BR>
<P>Does calling someone a luddite (whether it is true or not) increase or
<BR>
decrease the probability of converting them to a &quot;better&quot; mode of
<BR>
thought? I'd be interested in hearing everyone's take on this, not just
<BR>
Mike's.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; decided to attack again with a new round of inflamatory name calling:

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mike, here is Merriam-Webster's defintion of non sequitur...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;a statement (as a response) that does not follow logically from anything previously said&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; It's possible you're so anxious to get me that you're not making enough sense for me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; responsibly respond.  So I'm going to let the thread go and instead start a new one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps its that you have no ability to debate my points, and prefer to call
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them attacks specifically because you cannot answer them. Being able to label
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something a non sequitur requires that the recipient of the comment be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think logically. What I am anxious about is to figure out why you, a luddite,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would willfully subscribe to a known anti-luddite list, snipe the list with your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unfounded luddite propaganda, and act all incredulous and surprised that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't take up the challenge to quickly dispatch your ridiculous comments. Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would you, the agressor, complain that your are being 'attacked' when it is you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who initiated the action? You sound like a terrorist holding hostages who shoots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a hostage and tells the negotiator,&quot;Now look at what you made me do.&quot;
