<EM>&gt; Just out of curiousity, show of hands: How many here have worked or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working for startups?  I've worked for two so far.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since 1983, first as a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) later (1986) as
<BR>
a lawyer/CPA, I've worked with clients  to set up and run small
<BR>
businesses. In 1994 I turned most of my clients over to my partner and
<BR>
semi-retired to the country, keeping only a few of my favorite clients
<BR>
and doing mostly accounting and tax related work (my law license is
<BR>
currently inactive).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;A friend of mine was recently telling me about an article he'd read that
<BR>
concluded that one of the main reasons for failure of startups is lack
<BR>
attention to accounting.  I've never seen such an article; wish I could
<BR>
find it.  I've recently begun taking on a few new clients since the
<BR>
severe drought in Texas seems to be forcing me from my hermitage and back
<BR>
into society to some extent.  Of all the paying jobs I've done, working
<BR>
with small businesses is one of my favorite. Entrepreneurs are generally
<BR>
delightfully optimistic, eccentric (in a good way), unpretentious people.
<BR>
&nbsp;I love working with them.
<BR>
<P>I'm happy to say that most of my clients have stayed in business, though
<BR>
most have gone through some rough times.  I myself had an earlier
<BR>
business that went under during the recession in the 80's.  I've found
<BR>
that rather than lessening my credibility as a business consultant, going
<BR>
broke is almost like a rite of initiation.  
<BR>
<P>For anyone contemplating a collaborative business venture, particular in
<BR>
any rapidly changing industry, I'd recommend having a look at Peter
<BR>
Small's books, *The Entrepreneurial Web* and *The Ultimate Game of
<BR>
Strategy* (the latter is due to be released in November). Synopses at
