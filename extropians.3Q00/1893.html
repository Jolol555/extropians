<P>1. Hemispheric Rights Group Intervenes in &quot;Drug Kingpin&quot; Death
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penalty Case, Cites US Violation of International Agreements
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#garza">http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#garza</A>
<BR>
<P>Juan Raul Garza could become the first person executed by the
<BR>
federal government since 1963.  The Brownsville, Texas, man was
<BR>
sentenced to death under provisions of the federal &quot;drug kingpin&quot;
<BR>
statute after he was convicted of operating a continuing criminal
<BR>
enterprise, marijuana trafficking, and involvement in three drug-
<BR>
related murders.  But his execution is now on hold as President
<BR>
Clinton and the Justice Department review federal death penalty
<BR>
procedures and address complaints from the Organization of
<BR>
American States (OAS).
<BR>
<P>A federal judge set an August 5th execution date for Garza,
<BR>
apparently to the surprise of the Justice Department, which has
<BR>
been studying racial and geographic disparities in federal death
<BR>
penalty cases.  On July 6th, President Clinton personally
<BR>
announced the hold pending the results of the Justice Department
<BR>
investigation.
<BR>
<P>Garza's attorney, Gregory Wiercioch of the Texas Defender
<BR>
Service, told DRCNet that the White House counsel's office
<BR>
confirmed in a July 7th phone call that the execution was on
<BR>
hold.  But, said Wiercioch, he still has not been officially
<BR>
notified and remains uncertain how long the hold will last.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We would ask the president to wait until the Justice Department
<BR>
commission rules before making his decision,&quot; said Wiercioch.
<BR>
<P>Garza has found an ally in the OAS, of which the US is a member.
<BR>
The OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (ICHR) has
<BR>
intervened in the Garza case.  &quot;The issue we raised with the ICHR
<BR>
is the government use of unadjudicated offenses in sentencing,&quot;
<BR>
said Wiercioch.  This is inherently unfair and in violation of
<BR>
international law,&quot; he maintained.
<BR>
<P>According to ICHR complaint, federal prosecutors violated an
<BR>
international agreement when, in the penalty phase of Garza's
<BR>
trial, they presented testimony about murders with which he was
<BR>
never charged, let alone convicted, and which allegedly occurred
<BR>
in a foreign country, Mexico.
<BR>
<P>Wiercioch told DRCNet that the US government has not responded to
<BR>
the IHRC's complaints.  &quot;In January, the commission wrote to the
<BR>
State Department, notifying the government of its concerns and
<BR>
asking the government not to execute Garza while they reviewed
<BR>
the complaint.&quot;
<BR>
<P>But, said Wiercioch, the Justice Department failed to reply to
<BR>
the IHRC within the mandated 90-day period.  The IHRC filed a
<BR>
second complaint and then a third, the latest coming in May.
<BR>
&quot;The government still has not responded,&quot; said Wiercioch.
<BR>
<P>Wiercioch welcomed the IHRC's intervention, he said, but sees its
<BR>
utility as more likely to come in the political realm rather than
<BR>
the judicial.  &quot;The IHRC can have a strong impact on a
<BR>
presidential clemency decision,&quot; he said.  &quot;The US has previously
<BR>
looked to the commission for guidance in interpreting
<BR>
international covenants, and for that reason the IHRC's complaint
<BR>
could have an impact on Clinton's decision to grant clemency or
<BR>
not.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The prosecutor's use of unadjudicated crimes against Garza in the
<BR>
penalty phase is not the only problem with the Garza case.
<BR>
Garza's prosecutors got the go-ahead for the death penalty from
<BR>
then Attorney General William Barr, who without any formal review
<BR>
had given the okay for 19 out of 21 death penalty requests from
<BR>
US Attorneys.  Under Attorney General Janet Reno, who has
<BR>
implemented an elaborate procedure for determining who is
<BR>
eligible for a death penalty prosecution, authorizations for a
<BR>
death penalty prosecution have plummeted.  According to
<BR>
Wiercioch, Reno has only approved one-third of the prosecutor's
<BR>
requests.
<BR>
<P>Wiercioch also notes that cases where the facts were more heinous
<BR>
than Garza's have not received the Attorney General's
<BR>
authorization.  &quot;This leads to questions about whether racial or
<BR>
geographical disparities are involved,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>Those concerns have merit.  According to the Death Penalty
<BR>
Information Center (<A HREF="http://www.essential.org/dpic/feddp.html">http://www.essential.org/dpic/feddp.html</A>),
<BR>
three-fourths of inmates on federal death row are ethnic
<BR>
minorities, and for those sentenced under federal anti-drug
<BR>
statutes, 89% are African-American or Mexican-American.  Of the
<BR>
20 federal prisoners currently awaiting the death penalty, five
<BR>
are white, 13 are black, one is Asian, and Garza is the sole
<BR>
Hispanic.
<BR>
<P>For Wiercioch and his client, however, the big question is what
<BR>
President Clinton will do once the guidelines are in place and
<BR>
the Justice Department's racial disparity study is finished.
<BR>
Clinton will then make a decision on Garza's case.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We'll have to wait and examine our options at that time.&quot;

<P>2. Interview with Mike Farrell:  Movie Payola, Death Penalty
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#farrell">http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#farrell</A>
<BR>
<P>Bloodied but unbowed, harassed yet heedless, drug czar Gen. Barry
<BR>
McCaffrey last week rode off to open a new front in his roundly
<BR>
criticized five-year, billion dollar mass media propaganda
<BR>
campaign.  The Office of National Drug Control Policy has already
<BR>
cut payola deals with television programs and magazines, in which
<BR>
those media produced anti-drug messages for cash prizes from the
<BR>
drug czar's bounty.
<BR>
<P>Now, McCaffrey is targeting the movies.  &quot;We are making available
<BR>
to the producers, directors, writers -- the creative community --
<BR>
the resources, the understanding that the National Institute of
<BR>
Drug Abuse gets out of $600  million a year of taxpayer dollars
<BR>
studying this issue,&quot; McCaffrey told Congress.  &quot;As powerful as
<BR>
television is, some experts believe that movies have an even
<BR>
stronger impact on young people,&quot; said McCaffrey.  While
<BR>
McCaffrey did not produce a detailed plan for Hollywood's
<BR>
participation, he said the process of enlisting filmmakers and
<BR>
screenwriters had already begun through workshops, briefings,
<BR>
roundtables and one-on-one conversations with industry leaders.
<BR>
<P>DRCNet spoke with Hollywood figure Mike Farrell about McCaffrey's
<BR>
latest scheme as well as the Raul Garza death penalty case.
<BR>
Farrell, a long-time TV and film actor and producer, is best
<BR>
known for his portrayal of the BJ Hunnicutt character in the
<BR>
long-running TV series MASH, and currently co-stars in the CBS TV
<BR>
series Providence.
<BR>
<P>Farrell has also parlayed his celebrity status into a role as a
<BR>
committed and effective activist, especially on issues related to
<BR>
human rights and criminal justice policy.  He is the Chairman of
<BR>
Death Penalty Focus (<A HREF="http://www.deathpenalty.org">http://www.deathpenalty.org</A>) and the Co-
<BR>
Chair of Human Rights Watch/California, and is a member of the
<BR>
advisory board of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
<BR>
Penalty.  Farrell is also a spokesperson for CONCERN/America,
<BR>
Good Will Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for
<BR>
Refugees and a member of California's Commission on Judicial
<BR>
Performance.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  What do you make of Gen. McCaffrey's latest foray into the
<BR>
entertainment business?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  He sought a way to make an effective end run around the
<BR>
censorship issue and still put money into films that convey his
<BR>
message.  This is an example of the heavy hand of the government
<BR>
intruding into an area of social policy and seems close to
<BR>
government manipulation of public attitudes.  That is a very
<BR>
dangerous area.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  Some industry figures have been quoted as saying that
<BR>
Hollywood is such a money-driven town that the industry would
<BR>
find the drug czar's financial blandishments irresistible.  What
<BR>
do you think?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  Oh, yes.  This is a business of whores to a significant
<BR>
degree, and it will perk up the ears of all of those people who
<BR>
are money-driven.  The effect could be relatively benign if the
<BR>
movie already carried an anti-drug message, but if writers or
<BR>
directors are skewing their work so its fits within certain
<BR>
guidelines to get that money, then that would be very disturbing.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  Hollywood has taken a lot of flack over portrayals of sex
<BR>
and violence, and now Gen. McCaffrey is implicitly pressuring the
<BR>
industry to portray drugs in a certain fashion.  What sort of
<BR>
responsibility does the industry have toward audiences or society
<BR>
at large?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  We all need to aware of needs of society and the
<BR>
vulnerability of the audience to whom we're speaking.  I think
<BR>
Hollywood has a big responsibility in terms of portraying life
<BR>
realistically and appropriately.  Like life itself, sometimes
<BR>
these messages are life-affirming, but sometimes they are not.
<BR>
That's not my business.  In real life there is sex, there is
<BR>
violence, there is indulgence in behaviors that some find
<BR>
reprehensible.  And although I'm not personally a fan of
<BR>
entertainment that promotes or is irresponsible in promoting
<BR>
wanton sex, or violence, or overindulgence, we cannot allow
<BR>
ourselves to be bludgeoned into censorship.  There's a tendency
<BR>
toward self-censorship already, especially when artists go into
<BR>
an area they fear will spark controversy or a hostile response.
<BR>
That is a terrible insult to the artistic process.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  So, what should or could the film community do in terms of
<BR>
drugs as a social issue?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  In terms of drugs and drug policy, there are things my
<BR>
community can do that would be much more beneficial to the
<BR>
community at large than adapting our messages to fit some outside
<BR>
guidelines.  We could realistically show the impact of drug use,
<BR>
we could show the positive, pro-social effects of drug education
<BR>
and rehabilitation -- all of those things we wish the government
<BR>
were promoting instead of filling our prisons.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  Is there anything you like about McCaffrey's proposal?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  I'm pleased that he's being as overt as he is, because
<BR>
then people are forewarned and thus forearmed.  There are already
<BR>
so many of what we used to call &quot;hidden persuaders&quot; that it is
<BR>
frightening to think the government is getting involved.  As if
<BR>
they would be any better for us than the others, the private
<BR>
interests.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  Let's turn to the subject of Juan Raul Garza.  In your
<BR>
capacity as chair of Death Penalty Focus you've been deeply
<BR>
involved in his case and in the broader issues surrounding the
<BR>
death penalty.  What is your reaction to President Clinton's
<BR>
decision to put Garza's execution on hold?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  I was part of a campaign to inform the president about
<BR>
our feelings on this issue and to help him understand that
<BR>
killing Raul Garza would in many respects run counter to the
<BR>
interests of the nation.  I am pleased we were able to convince
<BR>
the president to postpone the execution and start a review of the
<BR>
whole federal death penalty process.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  Opponents of Garza's execution have pointed to several
<BR>
problems with how the decision to seek the death penalty in his
<BR>
case was made.  The OAS, for instance, has intervened, claiming
<BR>
prosecutors violated international covenants when, in the trial's
<BR>
penalty phase, they asked the jury to consider murders for which
<BR>
Garza was never tried, let alone convicted.  What is your
<BR>
reaction to this argument?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  It was outrageous conduct.  Using murders where he
<BR>
wasn't tried or convicted was an extraordinary act on the part of
<BR>
the prosecution, probably unprecedented and definitely unethical.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  Garza's attorney has indicated that he will raise issues of
<BR>
racial and geographic disparity in the administration of the
<BR>
federal death penalty.  What about such disparities?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  The preponderance of minorities on death row, the
<BR>
institutional racism and corruption on the part of ambitious
<BR>
prosecutors, and even the chance of human error, all are
<BR>
increasingly disturbing to many people.  To allow a man of
<BR>
Hispanic origin to be the first executed without taking a serious
<BR>
look at the history of death penalty prosecutions at the federal
<BR>
level would be indiscreet, if not downright criminal.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  What is it that drives politicians to so rabidly support
<BR>
the death penalty?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  Not unlike the drug war, the death penalty is a
<BR>
political tool that has nothing to do with justice and is not
<BR>
good social policy.  Both are the result of ambitious politicians
<BR>
looking to push emotional buttons that can ensure their political
<BR>
power.  They're certainly more interested in that than in solving
<BR>
social problems and ensuring the public safety.
<BR>
<P>WOL:  The death penalty issue has achieved a high profile this
<BR>
year with Gov. Ryan's moratorium in Illinois and the focus on
<BR>
Gov. Bush's record in Texas, among other things.  Is there reason
<BR>
to think the tide is beginning to turn?
<BR>
<P>Farrell:  Yes.  President Clinton's action in calling for a hold
<BR>
on Garza's execution while Justice completes its review of racial
<BR>
and geographic disparities and establishes guidelines for
<BR>
clemency petitions was a defensive action, as well as being an
<BR>
appropriate action.  The increasing prominence of the whole death
<BR>
penalty issue is a sign that in this country we are seeing a
<BR>
willingness to rethink our positions.  At long last, because of
<BR>
organizations like yours and ours with our continued insistence
<BR>
on good, solid information to counter the official line, we are
<BR>
now finding traction with people who might otherwise not know any
<BR>
better.  This is a hopeful sign, indeed.  People are asking for
<BR>
straight talk from their politicians and requiring them to
<BR>
justify the outrageous statements they make in support of their
<BR>
outrageous policies.
<BR>

<BR>

<P>3. California Medical Marijuana Moves Ahead on Two Fronts
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#calmedmj">http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#calmedmj</A>
<BR>
<P>It's been a heady week for medical marijuana supporters in
<BR>
California, where the city of San Francisco and a federal judge
<BR>
took substantive actions that should make it easier for seriously
<BR>
ill people to use marijuana.
<BR>
<P>In San Francisco, District Attorney Terence Hallinan announced on
<BR>
July 14 that the city will issue ID cards for medical marijuana
<BR>
users that will free card-holders from fear of local
<BR>
prosecution.  Three days later, US District Judge Charles R.
<BR>
Breyer ruled that the Oakland Cannabis' Buyers Cooperative could
<BR>
reopen and again begin serving its roughly 5,000 registered
<BR>
members.
<BR>
<P>The San Francisco program will require a doctor's signed
<BR>
agreement to monitor the patient's medical condition.  The cards
<BR>
cost $25 and are good for two years.  The cards, which include
<BR>
the patient's photograph, card number and issue date, will also
<BR>
be issued to minors who have their parents' or guardians'
<BR>
permission.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This represents another stone in the foundation we're building
<BR>
to make people recognize that cannabis is a legitimate medicinal
<BR>
agent,&quot; San Francisco DA Hallinan told the San Jose Mercury
<BR>
News.  &quot;I'm not really worried we won't be able to work things
<BR>
out with the federal government.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Jane Weirick uses marijuana to help alleviate pain from a back
<BR>
ailment.  She told the Mercury News that the ID cards will
<BR>
&quot;finally give us legitimacy.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;I was taking prescription opiates and was stuck in bed all the
<BR>
time,&quot; Weirick said.  &quot;When I started taking cannabis, I was
<BR>
finally able to function.  It was like night and day.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Across the bay from San Francisco, Judge Breyer modified an
<BR>
injunction he had issued in September 1998 in US v. Oakland
<BR>
Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative that shut down the club and four
<BR>
others.  The newly modified injunction effectively exempts the
<BR>
clubs from prosecution under federal marijuana possession,
<BR>
cultivation, distribution and conspiracy statutes.
<BR>
<P>Judge Breyer spelled out stringent criteria for patients who seek
<BR>
such an exemption.  In addition to suffering from a serious
<BR>
medical condition and facing imminent harm without access to
<BR>
cannabis, patients are required to have no reasonable legal
<BR>
alternative to cannabis for treating or alleviating their
<BR>
condition or symptoms.
<BR>
<P>Breyer's original injunction was undone by the US Ninth District
<BR>
Court of Appeals in San Francisco.  The appeals court ordered
<BR>
Judge Breyer to revisit his earlier order and consider an
<BR>
exemption for patients who faced imminent harm and who had no
<BR>
effective alternative to marijuana.  The Court of Appeals ruled
<BR>
that Judge Breyer should consider an exemption since the
<BR>
government had failed to rebut evidence that cannabis is the only
<BR>
effective source of relief for a large group of seriously ill
<BR>
patients.
<BR>
<P>In his July 17th ruling, Judge Breyer said the government had
<BR>
failed to make any new arguments against medical marijuana,
<BR>
instead repeating arguments already rejected by the Court of
<BR>
Appeals.
<BR>
<P>Patients and supporters of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers'
<BR>
Cooperative were ecstatic.  &quot;It's an historic day,&quot; Jeff Jones,
<BR>
executive director of the co-op, told the Mercury News.  &quot;For the
<BR>
first time in our nation's history, the Controlled Substances Act
<BR>
has been pierced in a way that allows a controlled substance to
<BR>
be given out in a federally exempt way.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Not everyone was so enthused.  Some activists condemned the
<BR>
eligibility restrictions Judge Breyer placed on patients,
<BR>
particularly the provision requiring that patients try &quot;all legal
<BR>
alternatives to cannabis&quot; in order to qualify.  Others worried
<BR>
that the ruling could be the preamble to a government appeal to
<BR>
an unfriendly Supreme Court.
<BR>
<P>But most observers, while conceding that the ruling had its
<BR>
flaws, contended that it constituted an overall victory for the
<BR>
medical marijuana movement.
<BR>
<P>After the ruling was announced, Jones called on the federal
<BR>
government to take the next step and reclassify marijuana as &quot;an
<BR>
accepted therapeutic plant,&quot; the New York Times reported.  &quot;The
<BR>
medicinal properties have already been accepted at the local and
<BR>
state levels,&quot; he said.  &quot;We're waiting for the federal
<BR>
government to catch up.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Jones told the Times that the Oakland club, which was the only
<BR>
one of the five to appeal the 1998 ruling that shut it down,
<BR>
could reopen during the week of July 24th.  He said his club was
<BR>
working with attorneys to devise the best way to reopen.  &quot;We're
<BR>
going to proceed cautiously,&quot; he added.

<BR>
<P>4. Study Says Pot Doesn't Interfere with AIDS Drugs, Scientific
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Comes After Years-Long Battle With Government Health
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honchos
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#abrams">http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#abrams</A>
<BR>
<P>Initial results are in from the first government-approved study
<BR>
of marijuana's effects on people infected with the AIDS virus.
<BR>
The research, done by a team headed by Dr. Donald Abrams of the
<BR>
University of California at San Francisco, found that smoking pot
<BR>
does not disrupt the workings of antiviral drugs that inhibit the
<BR>
growth of the AIDS virus -- and the patients involved gained
<BR>
weight.
<BR>
<P>Abrams announced the initial results at the 13th Annual AIDS
<BR>
Conference in Durban, South Africa, last week.  Further results
<BR>
will be released soon, Abrams told reporters at the conference.
<BR>
<P>In an indication of the politically charged atmosphere in which
<BR>
research on marijuana in the US currently takes place, Abrams'
<BR>
research proposals dating back to 1992 could not win government
<BR>
approval as efficacy studies (research that would demonstrate the
<BR>
effectiveness of marijuana in improving the appetite, body
<BR>
weight, and general well-being of AIDS patients and others
<BR>
suffering from wasting syndrome).
<BR>
<P>Instead, Abrams' research was designed to see whether the
<BR>
components of marijuana interfered with the body's ability to
<BR>
break down the components of protease inhibitors, which are
<BR>
antiviral drugs used by thousands of HIV-infected people to
<BR>
maintain their immune systems.
<BR>
<P>Some 62 subjects participated in the study, and all were confined
<BR>
in a unit of San Francisco General Hospital for the experiment's
<BR>
21-day duration.  Some were given marijuana from the National
<BR>
Institutes of Health (NIH), some received marinol, and others
<BR>
received placebos.  The 20 patients who received marijuana smoked
<BR>
it three times a day in a closed, ventilated room so that second-
<BR>
hand smoke would not affect other participants in the study.
<BR>
Each patient had a refrigerator stocked with snacks at bedside.
<BR>
The fridges were locked at midnight.
<BR>
<P>In all three groups, the study showed that levels of the AIDS
<BR>
virus either dropped or remained unchanged.  Neither marijuana
<BR>
nor marinol interfered with the breakdown of protease inhibitors.
<BR>
Also, although the research was not designed as an efficacy
<BR>
study, Abrams announced that patients gained weight under the
<BR>
experimental regime, an average of 7.7 pounds for the marijuana
<BR>
smokers and 7 pounds for those who took marinol pills.
<BR>
<P>The findings have been greeted with enthusiasm by both medical
<BR>
professionals and medical marijuana activists.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Any good clinician with his eyes and ears open has known for a
<BR>
long time that cannabis is very useful in the treatment of AIDS
<BR>
reduction syndrome and does not harm patients,&quot; Dr. Lester
<BR>
Grinspoon told the Associated Press.  Grinspoon is a professor of
<BR>
psychiatry at Harvard and author of &quot;Marijuana: The Forbidden
<BR>
Medicine.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;When all the dust settles and when marijuana is admitted into
<BR>
the US pharmacopoeia, it will be seen as one of the least toxic
<BR>
drugs in the whole compendium.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;I guess this refutes Gen. McCaffrey's statements about 'Cheech
<BR>
and Chong' medicine,&quot; snorted Dale Gieringer, leader of
<BR>
California NORML.  &quot;It confirms common sense.  AIDS doctors have
<BR>
been using pot widely in the Bay area and California in general
<BR>
for years now,&quot; he told DRCNet.
<BR>
<P>Still, said Gieringer, &quot;medicine has to confirm common sense,&quot;
<BR>
but the study's greater significance may lie in the fact that &quot;it
<BR>
got done.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is the only study on medical marijuana initiated and
<BR>
completed since Proposition 215 (legalizing medical marijuana in
<BR>
California) passed,&quot; Gieringer noted.  &quot;It shows the outrageous
<BR>
slowness of the government's response to the mandate of the
<BR>
voters.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's astounding that we could only get one study done, and not
<BR>
even an efficacy study at that,&quot; he added.  &quot;In a sense, we are
<BR>
not one step closer to winning government approval of medical
<BR>
marijuana because it was not an efficacy study.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Gieringer's complaints about government inaction are understated;
<BR>
the attitude of the federal government could fairly be described
<BR>
as obstructionist.  The saga of Dr. Abram's research helps
<BR>
explain why.
<BR>
<P>Abrams had to overcome a series of politically motivated
<BR>
bureaucratic obstacles, beginning with the DEA's 1994 refusal to
<BR>
allow Abrams to import Dutch marijuana for a study of AIDS
<BR>
wasting syndrome.  The study had been designed with help from the
<BR>
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and had already won approval
<BR>
from the university and the California Research Advisory Panel.
<BR>
None of that mattered to the DEA.
<BR>
<P>Next, Abrams applied to the National Institute on Drug Abuse
<BR>
(NIDA), requesting to use some of its marijuana supply for his
<BR>
study.  After nine months, NIDA Director Dr. Alan Leshner turned
<BR>
him down, saying Abrams' FDA-approved study was unscientific.
<BR>
<P>&quot;I wrote him back and said, well, gee, it's been approved by a
<BR>
number of august bodies, and for you to tell me it's not
<BR>
scientific was a little bizarre,&quot; Abrams told the Chronicle of
<BR>
Higher Education in a June interview.
<BR>
<P>When Leshner then suggested he might approve a request that had
<BR>
&quot;favorable peer review,&quot; Abrams dutifully applied for a grant
<BR>
from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  His proposal,
<BR>
modified to address Leshner's concerns, was rejected.
<BR>
<P>NIH reviewers expressed concerns about marijuana's toxicity --
<BR>
which is far lower than that of many approved prescription drugs
<BR>
-- and about patient risk from high cholesterol levels due to
<BR>
increased appetite.  &quot;That is really not something people with
<BR>
AIDS wasting have the luxury of worrying about,&quot; Abrams told the
<BR>
Chronicle.
<BR>
<P>By then, Abrams told the Chronicle, he was willing to concede
<BR>
that the obstacles in his path were more political than
<BR>
scientific.  Belatedly wising up, Abrams changed his research
<BR>
proposal to examine marijuana's potential negative effects.  This
<BR>
must have been just what the NIH doctors ordered, as Abram's
<BR>
revised research project to study whether marijuana interferes
<BR>
with the body's processing of protease inhibitors was finally
<BR>
approved, some five years after he presented his original
<BR>
research proposal.

<P>5. Illinois Congressman Bobby Rush Puts Decriminalization &quot;On The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#onthetable">http://www.drcnet.org/wol/146.html#onthetable</A>
<BR>
<P>On the eve of a conference on black-on-black violence set for
<BR>
Chicago this weekend, Rep. Bobby Rush (D-IL) has called
<BR>
decriminalization of drug offenses a &quot;possibility worth
<BR>
exploring,&quot; the Chicago Sun-Times reported this week.
<BR>
<P>Calling a spate of killings on Chicago's South Side &quot;a turf
<BR>
battle over drugs,&quot; Rush said the problem could not be dealt with
<BR>
by concentrating on guns and gun legislation &quot;in isolation from
<BR>
the drug wars that are occurring in our streets.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Rush, a four-term veteran who represents Chicago's South Side,
<BR>
has been active in some aspects of criminal justice policy, such
<BR>
as juvenile justice and police brutality, but has not previously
<BR>
broached the topic of decriminalization.
<BR>
<P>The former South Side alderman entered electoral politics via the
<BR>
civil rights movement and was a co-founder of the Illinois Black
<BR>
Panther Party in 1968. He is now chairman of the Congressional
<BR>
Urban Caucus.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There should be some open discussions pro and con about this
<BR>
issue,&quot; Rush told the Sun-Times. &quot;I believe that somehow we've
<BR>
got to look at, at least have a discussion about how do we take
<BR>
the profit out of drug use. And we've got to be bold about it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Rush's press secretary, Robin Wheeler, told DRCNet that although
<BR>
Rush had not spoken out on drug policy before, his comments were
<BR>
not a departure.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It may not have been an issue he touted before,&quot; she said, &quot;but
<BR>
he's been prompted to put it on the agenda because of the
<BR>
violence issue. All too often, drugs are at the center of the
<BR>
violence, so you've got to look at drug policy.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Wheeler, however, was careful to emphasize that the congressman
<BR>
called only for putting decriminalization on the table for
<BR>
discussion and he was not taking a stance in favor of
<BR>
decriminalization as a policy position.
<BR>
<P>Rep. Rush will host the Emergency Black Leadership Summit in
<BR>
Chicago on July 22nd. According
