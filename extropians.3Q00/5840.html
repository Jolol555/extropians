<P><EM> &gt; me&gt; You can't reciprocate to a god in any meaningful way. Tell me why a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; me&gt; god should consider us anything else than a feature of the landscape?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Because we are also intelligent conscious beings, albeit way s-l-o-w (at
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; least w/o augmentation)?  But then a voice said, &quot;Go tell it to the
</EM><BR>
<P>Trouble is, the complexity delta to the most advanced critters is
<BR>
probably larger than between us and viruses. Some of us study tobacco
<BR>
mosaic viruses, but we don't exactly think about ethics when doing
<BR>
that. These things are just too darn simple and obvious. We can make a 
<BR>
virus from components easily enough.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; chimps.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Because we are its creators/progenitors?  For the latter, again, &quot;Go
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; tell it to the chimps.&quot;  
</EM><BR>

<BR>
Do you have specific sentimental attachment to cyanobacteria, or
<BR>
ursoup? Technically, they're our progenitors, too.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; OK.  So we hope that inter-species compassion makes really good logical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; sense and that the AI has a huge heart simply because that is the thing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; its hyper-intelligence naturally leads to?  We haven't figured out quite
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; why that will be but at least its a hope.
</EM><BR>
<P>Further difficulties lie in the fact that the AI is not homogenous,
<BR>
because it has radiated after nucleation. It's name is Legion, and
<BR>
they're all of vastly differing complexities.
