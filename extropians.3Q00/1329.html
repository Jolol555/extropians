<P>
Anonymous e-cash is, indeed, dead... but I have hope that it will be
<BR>
reborn.
<BR>
<P>The most potent e-cash system was invented by David Chaum.  It died
<BR>
when he decided that his anonymous e-cash program would be the ticket
<BR>
to making him rich.  (Of course, those who understand e-cash realize
<BR>
that it's not a way to get rich; it's a way to provide unmatched
<BR>
benefits to consumers.  But I digress.)  He patented blind signatures,
<BR>
the process of writing your signature on something you can't read.
<BR>
This allowed entities who functioned as &quot;banks&quot; to sign money orders
<BR>
without reading the order.  That way, you could later present the bank
<BR>
with a signed money order, and the bank would have no way of telling
<BR>
from whom you got the money.  You could easily send the money orders
<BR>
via e-mail.  He also patented a mechanism to prevent people from
<BR>
trying to reuse money orders they've already spent.  He then signed up
<BR>
with one tiny bank in Louisiana, and, with all the naivete you might
<BR>
expect from a man who spends lots of time thinking about encryption
<BR>
protocols, started his proprietary Digicash system, expecting the
<BR>
world to beat a path to his door.
<BR>
<P>To his surprise, they didn't.  Oddly enough, people didn't want to buy
<BR>
and trade currency that they could only use at one bank, and which
<BR>
almost no merchants would accept.  Nor would merchants accept the
<BR>
currency when they had to pay Digicash money and retool their
<BR>
already-working credit card payment systems in order to accept it.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, Chaum's patent will run out in a few years.  At that time,
<BR>
expect to see a free version of Chaum's Digicash system proliferating;
<BR>
one that anybody can download and use.  You can even be your own
<BR>
&quot;bank&quot; (in the Digicash sense) simply by proving that you have some
<BR>
money and publicly signing an agreement to transfer that money to
<BR>
anyone presenting you with a valid coin.
<BR>
<P>An interesting point to note is that e-cash does NOT have to die
<BR>
simply because governments pass laws saying that overseas transfers of
<BR>
money may not be anonymous.  If Alice in America wants to send money
<BR>
to Bob in Britain anonymously, she can use something analogous to a
<BR>
cypherpunk remailer system.  Alice sends e-cash to her &quot;bank&quot; in
<BR>
America, along with instructions to send that e-cash onwards to Bob's
<BR>
(pseudonymous, if neccesary) address in Britain.  That American bank
<BR>
knows the identity of a bank in Britain, and legally sends the money
<BR>
to the British bank, along with Alice's instructions to send e-cash to
<BR>
Bob's address.  The British bank receives the e-cash and sends e-cash
<BR>
to Bob.
<BR>
<P>Of course, governments *could* make this system illegal by saying that
<BR>
NO transfers of money may be anonymous, overseas or not.  Of course,
<BR>
they'd never do that, right?
<BR>
