<P><EM>&gt;It's not about people wanting to keep their music from being passed around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There seems to be no problem with people passing around free digital 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;formats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of all kinds in private. The legal action only recently arises when other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;parties (software companies, servers, or whoever) are making a profit off 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;artists without the obligatory residuals: which usually amounts to a teeny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;small percentage of sales.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seeing as how Napster never sold anything, even its own software or ad 
<BR>
space, its pretty much a stretch to say that they made a &quot;profit&quot; off 
<BR>
artists or otherwise.  But then they were able to get some dimwits to cough 
<BR>
up venture capital, so I guess in a sense they were able to raise some 
<BR>
short-lived capital off artists' backs.  But whether they made a profit or 
<BR>
not was *not* what irked the RIAA (or Metallica or Dr. Dre).  What pissed 
<BR>
them off was that Napster was making music available for free, bypassing the 
<BR>
&quot;middlemen&quot; entirely.
<BR>
<P>I attended a seminar recently where a RIAA representative showed up and said 
<BR>
that their strategy was to shut down anybody making music available for 
<BR>
free.  At this point in the game they are loathe to prosecute the individual 
<BR>
fans/pirates because of fear of the backlash they would face if they started 
<BR>
prosecuting their own customers.  But my guess is it won't be long before 
<BR>
they start making &quot;examples&quot; out of a few people just to get the point 
<BR>
across.
