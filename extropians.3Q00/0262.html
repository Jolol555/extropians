Any of our rocket experts heard about this?:

<P>Inventor building rocket in back yard 
<BR>
<P><P>by Gordon Gregory 
<BR>
Newhouse News Service 
<BR>
BEND, Ore. - Brian Walker, a toy inventor with no college degree and almost
<BR>
no flight experience, plans to blast himself into space next summer in a
<BR>
rocket he is building in his back yard. 
<BR>
<P>Walker, who looks more like a middle-aged TV junkie than an astronaut, is
<BR>
spending a quarter-million dollars to fulfill a lifelong ambition. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I'm planning on being the first private human being to go to space in a
<BR>
home-built rocket. . . . I'm out to demystify space travel,&quot; he said. 
<BR>
<P>It sounds crazy. 
<BR>
<P>But an aerospace engineer says Walker's rocket design is simple enough to
<BR>
work. And a former astronaut who met him last year at a space tourism
<BR>
symposium thinks Walker has the right combination of guts, audacity and
<BR>
know-how to pull it off. 
<BR>
<P>However, Walker will have to overcome a lot of obstacles before he can go
<BR>
into space, including persuading the Federal Aviation Administration to give
<BR>
him a license to launch his craft. 
<BR>
<P>Walker plans to power his 9-foot-tall capsule with custom hydrogen peroxide
<BR>
rockets built by a Florida company that specializes in making rockets to
<BR>
power superfast cars and motorcycles. 
<BR>
<P>The 44-year-old is building the capsule in a warehouse-sized shop on his
<BR>
Bend-area property. He also has built a backyard centrifuge, which he'll use
<BR>
to acclimate his body to high gravitational forces. 
<BR>
<P>Walker has designed and built hundreds of devices. He gets royalty checks
<BR>
from 18 of his inventions, including an air-powered toy bazooka sold at
<BR>
Wal-Mart and a laser light show device found at Target. 
<BR>
<P>Soon, he'll be constructing a 30-foot-long launch trailer he plans to tow
<BR>
into the Alvord Desert just east of Steens Mountain next year for his solo
<BR>
flight. 
<BR>
<P>Many skeptics would tell him he is nuts to think he can blast himself into
<BR>
space and return in one piece. But since he was a kid watching the Mercury,
<BR>
Gemini and Apollo flights on TV, Walker has longed to be an astronaut. 
<BR>
<P>He knew he'd never make it at NASA because all the early astronauts were
<BR>
career military men. &quot;I just didn't see myself going through a military life
<BR>
to get there,&quot; he said. &quot;As an 8-year-old kid I said, `Well, I'm going to
<BR>
grow up and build my own rocket.' &quot; 
<BR>
<P>For the past three years, he has put his intellect and energies into
<BR>
figuring out how to do it. 
<BR>
<P>Walker's space capsule will have three thrust nozzles at the top of the
<BR>
engines and immediately below the capsule, and three at the nose of the
<BR>
capsule, allowing them to lift the craft upward. 
<BR>
<P>Most of the weight will be behind, and gravity will keep the rocket pointed
<BR>
upward. 
<BR>
<P>The fuel will be hydrogen peroxide that flows over a silver screen. The
<BR>
silver is a catalyst that causes the peroxide to instantly expand 600
<BR>
percent and generate steam heated to 1,380 degrees. That steam will be used
<BR>
to give the rocket its lift. 
<BR>
<P>The capsule will sit on top of 10, 14-foot tanks of 90 percent hydrogen
<BR>
peroxide containing some 7,000 pounds of fuel. 
<BR>
<P>When the tanks are empty, says Walker, they and the main engine will be
<BR>
jettisoned and guided back to Earth on a parachute-style wing controlled
<BR>
from the ground by an assistant. 
<BR>
<P>After the fuel tanks and main engine are jettisoned, the capsule should be
<BR>
hurtling upward at about four times the speed of sound. 
<BR>
<P>Walker figures the peak of his trajectory would be about 160,000 feet, or 30
<BR>
miles above Earth. 
<BR>
<P>(According to NASA, that will put him on the edge of space. Most scientists
<BR>
define space as beginning at 62 miles, or 100 kilometers, above Earth.) 
<BR>
<P>Walker will be wearing a Russian-built anti-G suit and two other special
<BR>
suits that will give him a pressurized, heated environment. 
<BR>
<P>As the capsule begins its descent, says Walker, a small drogue parachute
<BR>
will deploy and retrorockets in the rear of the capsule will fire, slowing
<BR>
the craft from an estimated 600 mph to 300 mph or less. 
<BR>
<P>At about 10,000 feet, Walker says he'll deploy a large parachute-style wing
<BR>
to glide the capsule to a soft landing in the Alvord Desert. 
<BR>
<P>He has had some experience flying paragliders. He will have radio
<BR>
communication with the ground and a locating device. 
<BR>
<P>Robert Frisbee, senior engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the
<BR>
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., said Walker's plan
<BR>
should work in theory. 
<BR>
<P>Frisbee said the engines are simple - although hydrogen peroxide at high
<BR>
concentrations is highly volatile and tricky to handle - and can produce an
<BR>
enormous amount of power. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;There's nothing inherently wrong with this,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;It'll be a
<BR>
wild ride.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Walker will have to get FAA clearance before he launches his rocket. The FAA
<BR>
will review the design of the craft as well as the flight plan before
<BR>
considering issuing a license. 
<BR>
<P>Walker acknowledges there are serious risks, but he thinks his plan is
<BR>
limited enough to succeed. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I'm not going orbital. I'm not going to the moon,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm only
<BR>
carrying so much fuel. I can only go so high, and when I run out of fuel,
<BR>
I'll come back down.&quot;
