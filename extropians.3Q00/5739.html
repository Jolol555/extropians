<P>
this is analogous to:
<BR>
<P>people in holland via megaphone shouting &quot;god is dead&quot; during bell
<BR>
extolation (except that the releases are simultaneous.)  not a smart,
<BR>
post-party release.
<BR>
<P>i'm certain that all entities can decide/summate about when it is
<BR>
appropriate to release.

CPWELLINGTON (Reuters) - Apartment dwellers have a new weapon to use on noisy
<BR>
CPneighbors, with a New Zealand man recording a compact disc of 64 minutes of
<BR>
CPlawnmower noise.
<BR>
CP
<BR>
CP``If your neighbors have a party Saturday night fairly late...what you do is you
<BR>
CPget up at seven o'clock in the morning, put the hour of lawnmowing sound on and
<BR>
CPgo out to a cafe,'' Wellington noise man and cafe owner Geoff Marsland told
<BR>
CPReuters Monday. The astro-turf covered CD offers listeners general lawnmower
<BR>
CPsounds along with feature moments such as the emptying of the catcher and stones
<BR>
CPhitting the blades.
<BR>
CP
<BR>
CPFive thousand of the CDs are on the market, of which more than 4,000 have been
<BR>
CPsnapped up by local retailers, Marsland said.
<BR>
CP
<BR>
CPThe album is his second. He previously sold around 4,200 copies of an album of
<BR>
CPurban noise such as a car alarm sounding off and a revving motorcycle.
<BR>
CP
<BR>
CPThat album -- entitled Urban Assault -- also featured three minutes of a baby
<BR>
CPcrying, which Marsland described as the ultimate contraceptive.
<BR>

CPend...

CPNow, If I'm on the 10th floor, just exactly how are you annoying people? I'd
<BR>
CPimagine most of one's neighbors would be in stitches....
