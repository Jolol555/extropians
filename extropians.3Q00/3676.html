Hmmm... close, but not exact.
<BR>
<P>Auditing has nothing at all to do with training... two different areas
<BR>
completely.
<BR>
<P>About the only thing that approaches the type of auditing you describe are
<BR>
ethics sessions... but those are VERY rare.
<BR>
<P>99% of auditing is asking the person to recall incidents of past emotional
<BR>
or physical pain (the infamous engrams) and if after going over it a few
<BR>
times the response on the e-meter doesn't diminish in intensity, that is an
<BR>
indication that there is an earlier, similar incident... so you have them go
<BR>
back to the earliest incident of a particular type.  That, btw, is how
<BR>
people end up &quot;recalling&quot; incidents in past lives.
<BR>
<P>Once a person is &quot;clear&quot; (no engrams?), the auditing becomes a self directed
<BR>
thing... there is no auditor, you do it yourself, holding the cans in one
<BR>
hand and using the other to adjust the meter to keep your response in
<BR>
range...
<BR>
<P>These standard questions are written on a work sheet... these are the &quot;OT&quot;
<BR>
(operating thetan) levels.
<BR>
<P>I'm not really sure exactly what the meter is reacting to on the OT
<BR>
levels... the stuff sounds so silly it's completely unbelievable... souls
<BR>
(thetans) being trapped by advanced electronic means and implanted with
<BR>
desires for physical bodies... happening long long ago in a galaxy far far
<BR>
away.
<BR>
<P>It really doesn't much matter how you try and twist it, there isn't any type
<BR>
of brainwashing going on.  What is there is information (mostly non true...
<BR>
and non verifiable) being presented and then the real experience of
<BR>
auditing.
<BR>
<P>The package was slick enough to hold my interest for two or 3 years in my
<BR>
youth... but in the end it was still just a bunch of people operating on
<BR>
faith, like any other religion.  I could have spent those years at an ashram
<BR>
and gotten just as much out of it.
<BR>
<P>As far as ethics investigations go... the E-meter is a very very inaccurate
<BR>
lie detector.  Nobody with any brains thinks that it actually works as one.
<BR>
<P>Real lie detectors don't work very well.
<BR>
<P>Where is Halperin's truth machine anyway?

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I notice that you seem to have somehow forgotten &quot;auditing,&quot; or are they
</EM><BR>
no
<BR>
<EM>&gt; longer doing that?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've known a couple of former auditors, who described the procedure
</EM><BR>
briefly.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   Basically, you hold on to two tin cans, which are the inputs to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;E-Meter,&quot; which is a glorified skin resistance meter, as in the little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lie-detector kits you could buy from Radio Shack.  The auditor asks you a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set of standardized questions and watches the E-Meter responses for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indications of tension related to a topic.  Tension indicates an internal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state of conflict.  Once the exact nature and source of the tension has
</EM><BR>
been
<BR>
<EM>&gt; isolated and identified, the person is asked to make a choice to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something about the problem.  Only when the person has genuinely committed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to positively resolving the underlying problem - as indicated by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reduction of tension - are they allowed to continue.
