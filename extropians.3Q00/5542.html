<P>You're the only person to have explicitly stated you'd give more than abillion
<BR>
- two people went up to that point then stopped there.  I'll state

<BR>
lifespan as I could.

<BR>
billion, even when it costs us nothing, it shouldn't surprise us that others
<BR>
aren't very enthused about our plans to become superhuman superpowers.
