<EM>&gt; But shouldn't an Extropian be a survivalist? Shouldn't he/she look at worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case scenarios and plan for those too?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but don't base your life on a 'sky is falling' premise, because most of
<BR>
the time, the sky stays where it is.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not really scared of catastrophes... but I'm scared of not including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them in my planning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surely there are those among us who have a real personal survival agenda...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I subscribe to MURG; I'm doing my humanscale cognitive software... I'm on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the various LE lists... good gosh I get 400 - 500 pieces of mail a day!
</EM><BR>
<P>Wasting your life on email? Hell, boy, git offa yer arse and live!! Whats the
<BR>
point of living forever if you spend it all worrying about the shitstorm that
<BR>
never comes. Life is for the living, not the dead or expectant, live it like
<BR>
you're alive.
<BR>
<P>My idea of survival is a closet full of chow and ammo that I pointedly ignore, a
<BR>
bit of daily exercise, a cryo account, a pint or two of Guiness (those
<BR>
lipoproteins are good fer ya), a quick bit of wit over the web, and time spent
<BR>
fishing. God does not subtract from your alloted time that spent fishing,
<BR>
don'tcha know. Sounds like a good entertaining suspension plan to me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd surely like to join an LE group that's not trying to sell me something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other than empirical soundness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But where does an Extropian/Transhuman who's seriously into this stuff go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for actual implementation... or do we STILL have to play a wait-and-see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game?
</EM><BR>
<P>That LE community people were chatting about in Arizona a month or two ago
<BR>
sounds like a decent idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mean this in all sincerity. I decided on my course of action in the very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; late sixties... I retire (as planned) in 2001 to do all the neat stuff. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three decades have shown that at least I'm persistent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surely there are others... we can't all be waiting for our respective ships
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to come in?
</EM><BR>
<P>My uncle, the postman, has a personal theory that the proper sequence in life is
<BR>
that we should all be retired until we are 45, then we should work until we drop
<BR>
dead, which obviously means you save to build a ship to come in for the next
<BR>
generation. His idea also means that whoever dies first wins... ;)
