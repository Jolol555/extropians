<P><EM>    &gt;Let's imagine a species - of bacteria, for example - that can only reproduce
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;within a narrow temperature range, although it can survive quite well over a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;much broader range.  Within this species, however, there are always a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;mutants, recessive genes, etc., for other temperature ranges scattered around.
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;If the species is subject to wide fluctuations of temperature, relative to
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;the reproductive range, over time spans longer than the usual time between
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;dividings, then if the species is not subject to aging and has a probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;lifespan due to other factors that is several times that of the typical
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;duration of temperature swings that take it out of the reproductive range,
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;then there is a good likelihood that a large enough number of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;non-reproductive species members will be around to reduce the food supplies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;etc., for the minority who may have the genes necessary to keep the species going.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes but has evolution every been able to produced a bacteria or anything else that works
<BR>
that way, something that doesn't just go dormant, something that still has an active
<BR>
metabolism and eats up lots of resources but can not reproduce? I'm nor sure but the only
<BR>
example that springs to mind is the human female who often lives decades after reproduction
<BR>
stops. However that particular example could be explained by the unusually long childhood
<BR>
of the species and the large amount of nurturing that entails. It makes me think that
<BR>
evolution doesn't work at the level of the group or even primarily at the individual level,
<BR>
I think the struggle for existence is fought at the gene level. Mostly.
<BR>
<P>As for aging, it seems to me it's always a negative, it's just not negative enough for
<BR>
evolution to change. A bug will probably get eaten within a year anyway so there's
<BR>
little point in maintaining the organism so well it could live longer than that, better to reduce
<BR>
the maintenance budget and increase the reproduction budget and have lots of offspring.
