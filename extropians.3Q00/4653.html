<P><EM>&gt; I guess so. But then, the workers have to put up with crappy conditions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (commuting, parking, or expensive living). I guess it's desirable; a city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gives you lots of job opportunity in a confined area. In turn, a city gives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  you lots of potential employees in a confined area.
</EM><BR>
<P>These kinds of things are relevant.  A couple years ago, a few of the Silicon
<BR>
Valley firms tried to move out of the very hottest areas into relatively 
<BR>
outlying
<BR>
areas (still part of the same contiguous metropolitan area).  They couldn't 
<BR>
get
<BR>
enough of the best engineers because the best people were in the Palo Alto
<BR>
-area core and so they had to move back after a few years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Funny thing is, if you spread it all out a bit, commutes would probably 
</EM><BR>
take
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  just as long in the worst cases (longer distances, but faster travel 
</EM><BR>
because
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  of emptier roads, so less agravation), no parking hassles (and costs),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cheaper housing near work (which cancels out the commute quite often). I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  just can't really grasp the sense of the mega high density city as a place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to put a knowledge-based business. But then, I haven't worked in the city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  for a long time now; can't remember what those elusive benefits are.
</EM><BR>
<P>In America, it's not the megadensity cities like Manhattan which are winning
<BR>
but high density suburbs.  I think the dominant factor is that in a 
<BR>
high-density
<BR>
suburb you get the most people in a convenient travel time.  It's not an 
<BR>
advantage
<BR>
during rush hour, but most of the time the roads are basically open.  The 
<BR>
concentration of people allows a remarkable degree of specialization, so
<BR>
you can do and find more in your life - personal or professional.  (I.e. you
<BR>
maximize the number of companies you can sneak off to an interview with
<BR>
or the specialization of your social clubs.)
