<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt; This is not a distinguishing characteristic of information.  -Nothing- has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inherent value independent of our want of it.  Value for cars and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; electricity and medicine and drooling pets and angora sweaters is created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because we want those things.  They don't have 'inherent' value-- we pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because we want, just like everything else.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, exactly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; No, that's not the difference at all.  The essential difference is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that freely-copied instances of the same piece of information can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be used to serve two people's goals simulatanously.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And why is this an argument in favor of freely copying them?  If it were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible to freely copy computer chips, would it then follow that we should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do so because they could be used to serve two people's goals simultaneously?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not by itself an argument for or against anything--it's a fact, and
<BR>
it's the direct answer to your direct question &quot;what's the difference...&quot;
<BR>
Asked and answered, counselor, move on.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But information is fundamentally different: it's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just that copying is cheap, it's that copying actually does double
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the utility (not value--utility, though utility may lead to value)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because my use of the information does not in any way interfere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with your use of the information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, receipt of information can have lot's of auxiliary impact and my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of information -can- interfere with your use of information.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me state it more clearly.  In a world without copyright, there does
<BR>
not exist any action that you may take with respect to your ideas that
<BR>
you cannot take by virtue of the fact that I too have the same choices.
<BR>
This is not true of physical things: if I choose to eat an apple, you
<BR>
cannot eat it even though you may have had a right to, because it's not
<BR>
there anymore.  If I /teach/ you how to grow apples, the fact that I
<BR>
also grow apples does not interfere in any way with your choice to do
<BR>
that (it may well, as you correctly point out, reduce your /market/ for
<BR>
the resulting apples, but that's a different argument).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Copying information doesn't always double it's value--
</EM><BR>
<P>...which is why I said exactly that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; sometimes weird things happen: if everybody knows the ending to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'The Sixth Sense,' the movie is going to lose a lot of its impact.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You see, there's value in secrets, and there's value in you and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowing something that Jack doesn't know and there's value in you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I -and- Jack knowing something, and all sorts of permutations.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree 100%.  I absolutely support any method you choose for making
<BR>
money by keeping secrets, or by exploiting differences in knowledge.
<BR>
What I oppose is the use of force to keep me from doing the same
<BR>
things with /my/ knowledge that you earlier chose to give me, unless
<BR>
I freely consented to that restriction by contract.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Okay, we're getting into tricky territory here and I don't want to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spin this off into an experientialist debate, but I would argue that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sensual experience is *only* information and will eventually be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; able to be replicated freely.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point.  At that time, only the &quot;timeliness&quot; of a performance
<BR>
and its ability to concentrate consumer attention will be its primary
<BR>
commercial values.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, this is an example of indirect rewards.  I shouldn't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rely on making profits off of the medium on which I distribute my data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CDs are going to be irrelevant fairly soon here.  The value is in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; music.  That's what people want, and therefore that's what they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should pay for...
</EM><BR>
<P>But as you just pointed out, it's /not/ the music that people want,
<BR>
it's the experience of hearing the music at a certain time under
<BR>
certain conditions, and /that's/ what you should sell.  Service, not
<BR>
data.  Perhaps you could sell subscriptions to a service that
<BR>
selects music in accordance with the user's taste and settings and
<BR>
beams it to him at the right time (perhaps to secure hardware, or
<BR>
accompanied by commercials).  Even if all the music is freely
<BR>
available, it will be an untamed sea of useless information like
<BR>
the web, and selling the service of finding good stuff, and
<BR>
evaluating it, adapting it, etc. will be lucrative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Again, famous people are a tremendously small sliver of the population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at large and are unlikely to appear in significant numbers at all in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment without monetary reward.  You seem to have little awareness of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the thousands and thousands of working artists who make a living producing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content.  Of course, they aren't famous after all, so why would you know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about them?  :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Granted, I know less about the music industry than about the publishing
<BR>
industry, so I'll have to rely on that for a counterexample.  Take a look
<BR>
at books like &quot;Grokking the GIMP&quot; and the DocBook reference.  These have
<BR>
a very limited audience: Linux graphics users, and XML-heads respectively.
<BR>
The entire text of each book, unabridged, is available on the web.  Yet
<BR>
the publishers (New Rider Press and O'Reilly) and authors sell enough
<BR>
dead-tree editions to make good money.  In the age on the net, where a
<BR>
small website can instantly reach an audience of millions, it doesn't
<BR>
take much popularity to make good money.  &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; is
<BR>
available on the Web in its entirety as well.  I own all three books
<BR>
in dead-tree form, and I'm sure Eric's publisher is quite happy with what
<BR>
he's done for them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Theatre's &quot;buy&quot; movies in order to make a profit, but why would they bother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; buying them if they could download them from the Internet for free?  If I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't sell my movies to theatres, I'm not going to spend millions making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them anymore.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, so that would be a stupid business model, wouldn't it?  Movies
<BR>
should be licensed to theater owners under NDA, who are given encryption
<BR>
keys in exchange for agreeing to the terms of how to distribute ticket
<BR>
revenues.  Ticket revenues alone, without any licensing whatsover, are
<BR>
more than enough to make money for good movies.  Even the $100M+ movies
<BR>
&quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; made millions in profit on ticket sales
<BR>
alone.
<BR>
<P>You seem to think I'm against market exclusion: I'm not.  What I'm
<BR>
against is /me/ paying for /your/ exclusion costs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You, however, decide to save all that money of actually making the film
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself so you send a guy over to my theatre with a really good copying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; device and you bring a copy back to your theatre and start showing 'my'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movie without having to pay for it.  Remember, I don't have any ownership
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over that film so it's totally legal for you to do this.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even if your technical means fail and this becomes possible, it still
<BR>
takes time.  It's also obvious: everyone will know which &quot;black market&quot;
<BR>
theaters don't sign contracts with the producers, and the producers
<BR>
will never give them first runs, or other perks, and the public will
<BR>
know which theaters always get the premiere, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, it doesn't matter:  you won't have any exclusive rights to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merchandising, so I'll just start making 'better' Star Trek t-shirts than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you and I'll make all the money.  The rewards are going to the best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; merchandiser, not the best filmmaker.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, authenticity has value.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think you vastly underestimate the incredible difficulty musicians face
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in making a living.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think most musicians vastly overestimate their talent and worth.  If
<BR>
you can't make a good living without copyright, you should be doing more
<BR>
productive work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Actually, it's not.  Shakespeare and Mozart are existing properties-- will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the market support the creation of additional properties in the absence of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reward system for the creators?
</EM><BR>
<P>In the absence of /any/ reward system?  Of course not.  In the absence of
<BR>
copyright, absolutely.  You simply can't ignore the fact that people
<BR>
/want/ creative work, and /they/ will figure out ways to get it, and to
<BR>
pay the people who make it.  It happens now, it happened throughout most
<BR>
of history, and it will continue to happen.  Yes, copyright makes certain
<BR>
artists more money on certain things.  So what?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; That's true, but that's also the way it is now: most of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rewards of copyright, /by far/, go not to the artist, but to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; company that makes the artist popular by controlling marketing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and distribution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a problem with the system and not the concept of copyright.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, this is the primary reason that I am optimistic about the digital age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insofar as it is empowering artists to reach their audiences directly.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's true, but the system as it is has manipulated the market and the
<BR>
artists to think that copyright is the only way to make money, so they
<BR>
don't pursue options.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Those who absolutely cannot make a living by /any/ of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; methods here or others I haven't thought of would really be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doing better for themselves and us by earning a living in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some other way.  Doing what you want is a luxury--just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; because someone wants to be a musician doesn't mean I should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pass laws to help him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ugh.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not suggestion that people should simply do what they want and get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; magically rewarded for it.  I'm suggesting that we maintain the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market-- I create something you want, you trade me equivalent goods for it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plain and simple.  You want music, I spend effort making music, you spend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money for my music.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm all for that too.  Now you want the /additional/ law that having
<BR>
done that--you, having freely chosen to give me the music--can use
<BR>
force to restrict me from using it the way I want, just because you
<BR>
created it.  That's not a free market, that's a protected market.
<BR>
You want to have it both ways--you want to be able to give it away
<BR>
and still keep it.  Make up your mind--if something's valuable as
<BR>
a secret, keep it secret and make money.  If it's valuable as a
<BR>
service, provide the service and make money.  I absolutely support
<BR>
any way you can think of to use your mind, your talents, and the
<BR>
information in you head to make money.  Now given that, if you then
<BR>
freely choose to give some piece of information to me (at whatever
<BR>
price, by whatever method, without contracting specific terms with
<BR>
me), you then want the government to step in to prevent me from
<BR>
doing what /I/ want with my talents and the knowledge in my head
<BR>
(that you happened to originate--setting aside for the moment that
<BR>
originality is undefinable anyway).  It is /you/ who is throwing
<BR>
the monkey wrench of force into the free market, not I.  If you
<BR>
only want to give information to people who agree not to compete
<BR>
with you, then get their consent on a contract.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you believe that passing laws making the theft of automobiles illegal is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an example of passing laws to help the automobile industry?
</EM><BR>
<P>Please stay on topic.  You know exactly what I think on the issue,
<BR>
you know exactly what the difference is, and your dishonestly using
<BR>
this rhetoric to distract from the real issues.  If you can't argue
<BR>
honestly, that says something about your arguments.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's another big post below that I've snipped that sounds like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beginning of a manifesto, and it seems really positive and momentuous like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we're just going to be so powerful if we could only cast off the bonds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership and I can't help but wonder if you are also in favor of communal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ownership of property, commodities, energy and goods, etc?
</EM><BR>
<P>I stand on my record as a militant capitalist.  I've already explained
<BR>
many times the difference between physical property and IP, and if
<BR>
there are people who still can't see the difference, they're beyond
<BR>
hope of understanding and I have nothing more to offer them.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Neither do I; see my other message on this thread about the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; confusion among copyright, trademarks, and fraud.  I totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; support both trademarks and criminalization of fraud.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?  And what value do you envision a trademark having?
</EM><BR>
<P>Trademarks are scarce plots of namespace: there can only be one
<BR>
hamburger joint named &quot;MacDonald's&quot;, and I support their right to
<BR>
sue others for the tort of fraudulently misrepresenting themselves
<BR>
as &quot;MacDonald's&quot; and damaging the associations the public mind has
<BR>
with the name.  Even if I have a right to copy a Metallica album,
<BR>
I don't have the right to sell my own album using that name,
<BR>
falsely pretending to be them.
