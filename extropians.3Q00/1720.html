<EM>&gt; As you may have noticed, the term &quot;singularity&quot; is used many different

ways.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; But it seems you think that there is more than a 90% chance that the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploads would kill you.  Is that because you are special, or do you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;90%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of everyone would be killed?  Do you expect that because that is what you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do if you succeeded in being one of the first?!  Think carefully; I may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start the &quot;Anyone but Emlyn&quot; faction.  :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Bwah ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa!!!!
<BR>
<P>No, I don't intend to kill everyone if I am uploaded first. Nor am I
<BR>
special, and thus worthy of special termination treatment (*sniff*).
<BR>
<P>I think there is a huge chance that the rest of us would not be uploaded by
<BR>
SIs. I wonder if they would be particularly attached to humanity (especially
<BR>
given periods of torture as corporate uploads), and I think they'd resent
<BR>
the possible competition. And if those who are not uploaded, and not allowed
<BR>
to upload, would have a terrible time of it. I imagine humans wouldn't have
<BR>
much utility in an SI economy; maybe we'd be popped in a sheltered workshop
<BR>
of some kind if we're lucky. Or in the carnobot, if we're not so lucky.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I should change what I said above to &quot;I'll kill you all! Ha ha ha!&quot;. I
<BR>
think an &quot;Anyone but Emlyn&quot; faction would be fantastic. Let's face it, my
<BR>
chances of an upload without it are pretty slim. Whereas, a strong lobby
<BR>
group trying to stop me would help spread the meme that &quot;Emlyn was a
<BR>
candidate for first upload&quot;. People would hear about &quot;Anyone but Emlyn&quot;, and
<BR>
think there must have been a chance that I would be uploaded. Most people
<BR>
would only remember my name, not what the message was about.
<BR>
<P>My best bet then would be to get friendly with the environment movement. I'm
<BR>
betting that &quot;Anyone but Emlyn&quot; would be mostly extros, which should whip up
<BR>
a healthy opposition of greenies if it is successful enough. Those guys are
<BR>
getting particular sway in government circles too. So, I'd just &quot;correct
<BR>
some misinformation&quot; (that is truly from the PR textbooks, if you're
<BR>
interested), and spread the complementary meme that &quot;extros are bad anti
<BR>
environment, anti gov fascists that eat babies (and baby seals); Emlyn is a
<BR>
good green, socialist leaning, government friendly, 100% recyclable tie-dyed
<BR>
environmental crusader who wants the best for our planet&quot;. Nice good-vs-bad
<BR>
meme basis, should take root.
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure if you guys can keep the heat up; if not, I'd do some
<BR>
fundraising for the anti-techie-fascist movement, and use it to hire a
<BR>
pseudo opposition to get out there and break some stuff, knock over
<BR>
someone's grandma, say nasty things about the queen mother. As the friction
<BR>
builds, the heat rises, I'd push the greenie-friendly government types into
<BR>
spending buckets on researching uploading. If some corporate entity beats us
<BR>
to the punch, we'd have it confiscated; Earth First!
<BR>
<P>Then, we'd put a few enemies of the state through the process (and turn 'em
<BR>
off quicksmart), until it's working. Finally, I'd be uploaded and
<BR>
distributed into govt computer centers around the world, ready to make the
<BR>
world safe from techno facists who want to chop down all the trees and
<BR>
replace them with plastic trees.
<BR>
<P>And then, well, then the fun begins. Bwah ha ha ha ha ha haaaaa!!!!
<BR>
<P>Maybe Emlyn++ the capricious SI would then upload you all, maybe not. I'm
<BR>
not qualified to comment.
