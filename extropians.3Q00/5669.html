<P><EM>    &gt;The comment was made that no capitalist ever forced people into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;concentration camp.  Perhaps not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only perhaps?
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;They just exploited the labor of the slaves the concentration
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; camp owners made available to them. And supported the rise and Reichs of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; concentration camp creators. And gave money to paramilitary organizations
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; that abducted and killed organizers that opposed the concentration camps.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's interesting, whenever somebody wants to show how evil corporations are,
<BR>
they always do exactly the same thing, they come up with a long list of rotten
<BR>
things that governments do. Go figure. Granted, few companies actively opposed
<BR>
these monstrous regimes, but that's not quite the same thing as instigating it now is it,
<BR>
and anyway can you really blame them for not playing the hero, in most cases it
<BR>
would be economic if not actual suicide.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; Capitalism has no ethics
</EM><BR>
<P>Unlike dictators and politicians who's pristine morality is legendary.
<BR>
<P><EM>      &gt;and has no necessary relationship to liberal  democracy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well yes, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;All they [capitalists] care about is their ability to generate  and keep profit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Would you rather have the world run by people who want  to save your soul,  or
<BR>
make you embrace the one true church, or save you from books that are bad
<BR>
for you, or think it would be good for you to died gloriously for an abstraction in a land
<BR>
you'd never heard of? I'd much rather they just worry about making money, they can't
<BR>
get into too much trouble that way. I don't want the powers that be to &quot;help&quot; me, after all,
<BR>
the farmer doesn't love me but thanks to capitalism he puts food on my table.
