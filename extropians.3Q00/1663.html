<P>Sorry, I thought he was saying that *I* was anti-GMO and then he started in on
<BR>
the strong language so I assumed he was calling me yet more names.  I really
<BR>
didn't see that line as a break in the whole outburst.
<BR>
<P>For the record, I don't think for a minute that the GMO juggernaut can be
<BR>
stopped.  It's just that I want each new GMO properly and scientifically
<BR>
studied before it is let loose in the environment.  Is that too much to ask?
<BR>
I've been fortunate enough to see the beautiful interplay of nature, really
<BR>
close---much more than most people, and perhaps a bit more than the few.  The
<BR>
books are full of disasters where something gets loose without good thought
<BR>
(sometimes after good thought).  Rabbits in Australia might serve for a simple
<BR>
illustration.  They have been no end of trouble and they spelled the end for
<BR>
some species.
<BR>
<P>Life forms reproduce.  If we are going to turn them loose, we need to test,
<BR>
experiment, study, and *really* think before we toss them out there to see what
<BR>
happens.
<BR>
<P>What is so Luddite about that?  Now, again for the record, I understand
<BR>
Luddites were people in early industrial age England who did things like
<BR>
tossing monkey wrenches into expensive machinery to f*ck things up.  How can I
<BR>
possibly fit that category?  What I'm against is people tossing scary things
<BR>
into the machinery of *my* world that can f*ck me up.  So, I ain't no
<BR>
Luddite---but some of you GMO-tosser people may be.
<BR>
<P>The burden for testing has to be on whoever wants to first pitch the lifeform
<BR>
out there.  It won't be too long until high school kids can gene splice in the
<BR>
basement.  If you think the 48,000 known computer viruses weirdos dreamed up
<BR>
are a pain in the rear, can you imagine the trouble when the type of kid who
<BR>
can gun down a dozen of his schoolmates finally figures out how to remap a few
<BR>
common bacteria so they are immune to anything in the docs' arsenals?  You
<BR>
people might want to worry about the ethics of GMO release instead of trying to
<BR>
figure how to get around one simple dirt farmer.
<BR>
<P>BTW, this really is my last comment on this thread.  You can't reason with a
<BR>
howling mob.  I want to discuss Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; and see if
<BR>
anyone would help me figure if ice-nine is possible---now or in the future.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
