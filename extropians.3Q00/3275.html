<EM>&gt; Question my claim all you want ;-)  By the way dear old Saudi is as about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as pro-capitalist, mercantilist as you get, from and economic point of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view.
</EM><BR>
<P>Trying selling your wares in Saudi Arabia without a license.  Try also doing
<BR>
things like having sex with who you want to and let the law there know about
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>If it wasn't for the oil, I bet, Saudi Arabia would be just another poor
<BR>
nation, probably a lot like Bangladesh.
<BR>
<P>Also, as a terminological matter, &quot;capitalist&quot; and &quot;merchantilist&quot; are a bit
<BR>
contradictory.  Merchantilism as an economic system is anticapitalist to a
<BR>
large extent, especially since it restrains trade.  Maybe you're using it in
<BR>
some other sense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And yes, you need nanotechnology to have real freedom. Otherwise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what's all the fuss about on the mailing list? Libertarianism never has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been really tested out, has it?
</EM><BR>
<P>True, though the less government control a given society has over its
<BR>
population, generally, the better off that society is.  That is history.
<BR>
It's sort of like saying
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In fact I suppose the largest intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contributors to Extropianism, may not indeed be Libertarians or agree with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its logical positivist philosophy of Libertarians.
</EM><BR>
<P>More confusion.  So?  The greatest thinkers in history often held despicable
<BR>
political ideas.  Einstein was a socialist, e.g.  Does this make socialism
<BR>
fine?
<BR>
<P>Also, logical positivism is not the philosophy of any major libertarians I
<BR>
know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My examples would be Minsky, Moravec, Tipler, et al.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then follow them.  No need to think or discuss.  After all, they have it all
<BR>
worked out.  Just read and agree, right?:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Max More may be devoted to Libertarianism,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or not) but I doubt if everyone on this list is.
</EM><BR>
<P>My point with my comment was not everyone on this list should become a
<BR>
libertarian.  It was just a lament on the fact that almost everyone who has
<BR>
responded to me on the Kosovo War has been for it.  Not one other here has
<BR>
spoken against it -- at least, not to my recollection.  And at least two
<BR>
people have given it their thumbs up.  I find that rather strange because I
<BR>
bet on any other list, on this topic, I'd find people who vary on that.
<BR>
<P>It's also strange because of any of you value sentient life, then you should
<BR>
be worried when sentients slaughter each other.  (Not to mention, resources
<BR>
wasted on wars are resources that could be used for other things, such as
<BR>
technoprogress.  Also, would you want the present governments, habituated as
<BR>
they are to mass murder, to have nanotech, AI, and such?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Otherwise it would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subscribe <A HREF="mailto:libertarian@majordomo.org?Subject=Re:%20Kosovo%20War%20Revisited&In-Reply-To=&lt;015101c009b1$e94ef0a0$cc86ecd1@neptune&gt;">libertarian@majordomo.org</A> or whatever. On getting rid of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictators I am all for that. As far as self-interest espoused by Ms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rosenbloom, contributing to the common good, I tend to say fuggedabodit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until we gots nanatech, then we can make our own dollhouses or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't you think that there will be a transitional period, as I hint at in my
<BR>
parenthetic comment?  I don't want to perfect tyranny then hope it backs
<BR>
down once it has even greater levels of technology at its disposal, which is
<BR>
why I'm speaking out against the Kosovo War and other such interventions,
<BR>
especially since the transition will probably take place here in the West.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
