There's an article in the current (July) Scientific American which
<BR>
presents an entirely different mechanism for age-related damage,
<BR>
glycation of tissue proteins.  At a minimum it seems there is much
<BR>
more to aging than DNA damage...
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/2000/0700issue/0700scicit2.html">http://www.sciam.com/2000/0700issue/0700scicit2.html</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Cerami of the Kenneth S. Warren Laboratories in Tarrytown,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N.Y., suspected some 30 years ago that sugar affects how the body ages,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on observations of diabetics, who age rapidly. Sugars are an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;essential source of energy, but once in circulation they can act as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;molecular glue, attaching themselves to the amino groups in tissue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proteins and cross-linking them into hard yellow-brown compounds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known as advanced glycation end products, or AGEs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, after years of bread, noodles and cakes, human tissues
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inevitably become rigid and yellow with pigmented AGE deposits. For
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most part, piling on dark pigments in the teeth, bones and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin is harmless.  But where glucose forms tight bonds with the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long-lived protein collagen, the result is a constellation of changes,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;including thickened arteries, stiff joints, feeble muscles and failing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organs--the hallmarks of a frail old age.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerami's team showed in the mid-1980s that aminoguanidine could keep
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tissues of diabetic rats and other old animals as elastic as those
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of young control subjects. It boosted their cardiovascular function
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and improved other age-related disorders. Further studies showed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that aminoguanidine lowered diabetics' urine albumin--an indicator
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of kidney malfunction--and delayed AGE-related damage to the retina.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single fountain-of-youth elixir is highly unlikely, says Tamara
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harris of the National Institute on Aging, because other activities,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as free-radical oxidation and possibly telomere shortening,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also contribute to the body's slow decline. Moreover, AGE-related
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research tends to be slow: Harris points out that there is no easy,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well-validated way to measure AGE in the body, a shortcoming that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complicates trials. To Harris, however, AGE breakers remain an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appealing option. &quot;This is a nice approach because it is multifocal,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aimed at a basic process that occurs in multiple systems. But,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she warns, &quot;there won't be one silver bullet.&quot;
