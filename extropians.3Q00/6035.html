Eugene Leitl writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How can you own something which is significantly smarter than you?
</EM><BR>
<P>To help explain this, let me recite a few statistics:
<BR>
25% of all married men kiss their wife goodbye when they leave the
<BR>
house.
<BR>
Of these same men 90% will kiss their house goodbye when their wife
<BR>
leaves.
<BR>
<P>Smart but poor people go to work for rich dumb people all the time. Henry Ford
<BR>
(or was it Edison?) reportedly said that the key to his success was hiring
<BR>
people who were smarter than him.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I fail to see the logic. You're describing a fantasy creature,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incredibly powerful as docile. Even djinns are that not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, AIs are fantasy creatures, because they don't exist (yet). My fantasy
<BR>
creature differs from yours in that mine has intelligence which makes it docile
<BR>
and cooperative, wheras yours wants to use my atoms to increase its memory. So
<BR>
I'm imagining a Buddha in the robot, and you're imagining an ogre in the robot.
<BR>
Are we both projecting inner feelings onto our fantasy creatures?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Unfortunately, the method which makes the AI powerful automatically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; makes it less than friendly. If it's friendly, it's less than useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see that at all, perhaps because I have no use for unfriendly genius.
<BR>
Then again, the perfect intelligent robot would be friendly to its owner and
<BR>
unfriendly toward others, rather like a guard dog.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because I can't think of any. And I'm trying rather hard. Because so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much is at stake I'd rather have lots of iron-clad reasons why AIs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will wind up being friendly instead of the other way round.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, what is your position? You think roboticists should be forbidden to make
<BR>
robots that are too smart?
<BR>
