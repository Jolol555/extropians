<EM>&gt; The Turning Point Project appears to be the first antitechnology organization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aimed specifically at the Singularity - they specifically oppose genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Some of the main players in this project, such as Miyoko Sakashita, have
<BR>
their personal ideologies moderately well-referenced on the net.  Their
<BR>
ideal world is a pre-corporate barter economy.
<BR>
<P>Of course, they don't like the Internet either, since it can't be used for
<BR>
&quot;ecospiritual&quot; purposes and is a tool of oppression for the Big Corps (tm).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I don't *think* these people will have a decisive influence on the future.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt that Congress or the public-at-large will have strong reactions to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech or AI until the first applications actually make it to the market, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least are demonstrated in the laboratory.  But I could be wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The Turning Point Project has apparently been sued by the Western Fuels
<BR>
Association for commercial defamation or similar, apparently in response
<BR>
to a global warming ad in the New York Times.  The regular old corporate
<BR>
interests aren't terribly pleased with these individuals either.  They
<BR>
would certainly have an uphill battle, as they are stepping on the toes of
<BR>
the entrenched powers-that-be with their advertising campaigns.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Where are these people getting their funding?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Apparently from them same sources as the other eco-nazis.  They have close
<BR>
ties to Friends of the Earth, Rainforest Action Network, and other
<BR>
eco-fundamentalist organizations.
<BR>
<P>They are apparently well-funded.  Turning Point Project has, by the
<BR>
references I've been able to dredge up, been spending in excess of $1.5
<BR>
Million per year on advertising alone and has been spending hundreds of
<BR>
thousands of dollars in other venues.  They certainly are not cash poor
<BR>
and have a non-negligible operating budget.
