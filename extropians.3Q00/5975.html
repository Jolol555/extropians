<EM>&gt; &gt; Your reasoning is based on a slow, soft Singularity, where both the

<EM>&gt; &gt; machines and humans converge, eventually resulting in an amalgamation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; advancing slowly enough so that virtually everybody can follow. While
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it may happen that way, I don't think it to be likely. I would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hear some convincing arguments as to why you think I'm mistaken.

<EM>&gt; A singularity which is &quot;slow&quot;; can someone explain this to me?
</EM><BR>
<P>A fast singularity posits that as soon as a smarter-than-human AI or mind upload
<BR>
occurs, then it will be a matter of days, weeks, or months before they and their
<BR>
associates go asymtotic. 
<BR>
<P>A slow singularity posits that long before this occurs, there will be a long
<BR>
gradual phase of human augmentation technology development, where people add
<BR>
more and more capabilities to their own minds, to some eventual point where
<BR>
their original bodies may die and they do not even notice, as the
<BR>
wetware/meatware part of their being has become such a small percentage of their
<BR>
actual selves. I personally am betting on this occuring, and not the punctuated
<BR>
equilibrium that others seem to think will occur with a fast singularity.
