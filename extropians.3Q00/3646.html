</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Thus, a philosophically naive person, thru his or her willingness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; such nonsense as part of the &quot;training,&quot; could easilly lose all grip on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reality as we know it, at least on a cognitive level.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't know much about Scientology other than what I've seen on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet. but I've known a person who practiced it and lived for a while
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their Florida community.  This person was one of the most disturbing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individuals I've ever talked to.  Whenever he spoke of a topic related to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scientology (and as their training is broad, many things in daily life
</EM><BR>
seem
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to be related to Scientology) he would begin to speak in a monotone, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though he were reciting words that had been fed into his mind under
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypnosis.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no hypnosis practiced in Scientology.  People learn by the unique
<BR>
method of reading books and being tested on what they've read.  The most
<BR>
esoteric thing they do is have people model key concepts in clay as part of
<BR>
the test.
<BR>
<P>This is frightening, folks.  You all seem fairly objective and level headed
<BR>
on most subjects... but on this one, I'd have to give the whole list an &quot;F&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Scientology is silly.  It's eastern religion altered by a science fiction
<BR>
writer to take on the trappings of a &quot;scientific&quot; belief system.
<BR>
<P>However... they don't hypnotize people, they don't tear families apart and
<BR>
they don't eat babies.  They ARE over litigious and a bit paranoid... but
<BR>
they have ample reason to be that way.  They have real enemies that use real
<BR>
nasty tactics.
<BR>
<P>The cult of christianity in all it's forms, from catholics to mormons, is
<BR>
much much worse.  You are wasting time and energy on the wrong target.
<BR>
<P>Loree
<BR>
<P>P.S.  I've never met any scientologist who behaved like you describe,
<BR>
Barbara.  I have met massive numbers of christians who fit that description,
<BR>
however.
<BR>
<P>I'll bet we all have.
