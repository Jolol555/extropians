It appears as if Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20SOC/AG-BIO:%20AgBio%20Industry%20Beginning%20to%20Wake%20Up&In-Reply-To=&lt;200007211402.QAA23311@color.sics.se&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt; wrote:

<P>Verily, verily, I say unto you...

<P>Generally, if one feels that one has spelled out the Truth(tm) and somebody
<BR>
does not agree, and does that in a way which one dislikes, one should IMHO
<BR>
simply stop at that point. Simply stop. No &lt;PLOINK&gt;, no goodbyes. Just stop.
<BR>
It saves bandwidth. It saves one's peace of mind. It lowers the blood pressure.
<BR>
If you feel somebody match your definition of raving idiot, then simply ignore
<BR>
that entity's posting. Unless that's me, of course. !-)
<BR>
<P>If the other part does not stop, or starts an ad hominem attack, one can
<BR>
simply use the filtering capability of one's mail reading software, and
<BR>
never more become bothered.
<BR>
<P>If y'all followed this method, those who didn't would pretty fast become a
<BR>
small minority voice yelling out in the Eternal Void.
<BR>
<P>Personally, I do so, but also un-filter the filtered people after some time
<BR>
to see if they still behave like idiots. If they do, I filter them again,
<BR>
and so on. Every time they give something relevant to the list, I bump up
<BR>
their relevance factor. Everything they behave like raving idiots, I decrease
<BR>
the value. The value decides how long I filter them, using an exponetial time
<BR>
scale. When someone has shown a continuous raving lunatic behaviour for a very
<BR>
long time, they will not appear in my reading for years. 
<BR>
<P>Thus endeth today's sermon. Better make it so.
