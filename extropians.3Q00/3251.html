<EM>&gt; I am not sure I disagree with your comments on the state of affairs in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Balkans over the last several decades.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where do you agree?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The we I refer to is the U.S. and European citizens.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then your usage is still a bit wrong, since the US and European citizens,
<BR>
also, were not part of the decision-making process, especially since during
<BR>
the war, in some countries, majorities were against it, such as Italy and
<BR>
Germany.  In most, there was sizeable (and mostly ignored) opposition to
<BR>
it -- even the US.  But it's great to use the plural.  So continue!:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I toyed with Libertarism back when the economy really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sucked back in the late 1970's, but I currently believe it to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unworkable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in large part because I believe we lack the nanotechnology to implement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't follow you here.  Freedom only works if one has nanotechnology?
<BR>
<P>It's funny that the more libertarian a nation is, typically, the better off
<BR>
its economy and its society as a whole is.  (Surely, there are
<BR>
counterexamples to the first part.  Saudi Arabia, sitting on top of huge oil
<BR>
reserves, is not doing to badly financially, but its society is not so
<BR>
great, especially with strict internal control to barely suppress those who
<BR>
are trying to overthrow its monarchy.)  This alone makes me question your
<BR>
claim.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This seems to be the first economy driven by technology only. The Nano era
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not here yet.
</EM><BR>
<P>Explain please.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am not attempting to embue guilt or a sense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responsibility upon you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, you certainly fooled me.  In fact, rereading your posts, I find it
<BR>
hard to interpret them any other way -- even after your above assertion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But there have to be a sense of  international law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in this era.
</EM><BR>
<P>And what is that law to be like?  NATO violated current international law by
<BR>
attacking a nation which was not an aggressor.  It also violated its own
<BR>
charter, since it is only supposed to attack when one of its members is
<BR>
attacked.  Also, the bombing itself -- the targets chosen -- are in conflict
<BR>
with international law.  (Of course, NATO members pay for and run the Hague,
<BR>
so I don't expect the Serbian brief filed there to go far.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The technology to inflict heavy damage has grown. I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot live under your own fig tree, so to speak, forever. People with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; vastly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different values might not chose to let you in peace.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a strange view to take, especially since Serbia did not attack
<BR>
another country.  Nor did it use high tech weapons.  Its military, in fact,
<BR>
is outdated in terms of technology.
<BR>
<P>Also, interventionism of the sort the US is practicing is just the kind of
<BR>
thing that breeds counter-interventions.  Note that neither Switzerland or
<BR>
Sweden are the targets of Islamic terrorists.  How come they are able to
<BR>
&quot;live under [their] own fig tree&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Note, too, that the countries with advanced technologies and militaries that
<BR>
use them are in NATO.  Serbia flew no stealth aircraft.  Nor does it have
<BR>
satelites.  Nor is it capable of all the things NATO members are, militarily
<BR>
or technologically.
<BR>
<P>Needless to say, your reasoning is strange and does not, in any way
<BR>
perceptible way, lead to the conclusions you're for.  The part about
<BR>
technology makes no sense in this context.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
