<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course they are good books, they were written by two people. JK Rowling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copied the work of an earlier author and rewrote them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Who was this earlier author she used?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Don't recall the name, but there is/was a plagiarism lawsuit going on filed by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the offended party.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I found some information on the web about this.  Rowling is being sued
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by American author Nancy K. Stouffer, who alleges that Rowling borrowed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; language and ideas from her 1984 book, &quot;The Legend of Rah and Muggles&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/317/potterplagiary031700.html">http://mrshowbiz.go.com/news/Todays_Stories/317/potterplagiary031700.html</A>:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Stouffer's litany of similarities begins with &quot;muggles.&quot; In Rowling's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Potter books, &quot;muggle&quot; is the word used by wizards to mean ordinary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    humans. Stouffer's muggles are Lilliputian little people who care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for two orphaned boys. More to the point, Stouffer says she owns a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    trademark on the word &quot;muggle.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Additionally, The Legend of Rah and Muggles features characters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    named Larry Potter and Lilly Potter, and Stouffer also writes about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    characters called &quot;Keepers of the Gardens.&quot; In addition to the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Larry/Harry link, Rowling also has a Lily (mind you, that's with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    just one &quot;l&quot;) Potter, and her books include a &quot;Keeper of the Keys&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    character.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IMO even if these similarities prove to be more than coincidence, it would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hardly be fair to say, as Mike did, that &quot;JK Rowling copied the work of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an earlier author and rewrote them&quot;.  His suggestion that such a practice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would &quot;of course&quot; lead to a good book is a non sequitur, as well.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had read an article a while ago that gave a far more detailed list of many
<BR>
similarities. It is actually rather stunning the level of 'coincidence'. My non
<BR>
sequitur was 'of course' a rhetorical jest... though I do agree with the rule
<BR>
that in general, the purpose of editors is to polish up the writer's product to
<BR>
make it better.  Whether Rowling was merely an editor of Stouffer's work as is
<BR>
typical of authors and editors like Joan Collins supposedly had, or merely
<BR>
cribbed details out of Stouffers work is obviously debatable. I have not read
<BR>
the work of either author, myself, and tend to shy away from corporate writers
<BR>
like Rowling in any event. Reading someone like Rowling is kinda like listening
<BR>
to REO Speedwagon....
