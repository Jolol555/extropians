<EM>&gt; &gt; For a practical example, take a market for transplant organs: I'm an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; average guy with failing liver - a new one would be of great value to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; me - and I can beg, borrow, and, steal perhaps $1,000,000 to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; literally save my life. You, on the other hand, are a fantastically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wealthy industrialist, worth more billions than you can conceivably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; spend the interest on, and you happen to like eating human liver,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cooked, whipped, and spread on crackers. Since $10,000,000 is worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; nothing to you, you easily out bid me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To resolve this paradox you have to look at how the billionaire got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his money.  Assuming he acquired it legally, he (or his ancestors) did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something so incredibly valuable to the human race that people rewarded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him with billions and billions and billions of dollars.  This was
</EM><BR>
society's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; way of saying thank you for the huge benefit he provided to mankind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, when he eats liver, he is taking the reward from that debt of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thanks humanity owes him.  It may seem unfortunate that he is able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; command resources that could mean so much more to someone else, but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the only way society was able to say thank you in a meaningful way.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In effect, humanity thanked him by giving him their livers, even though
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others wanted them more.

<P>There's a dangerous line of reasoning; money is good. If you have money, it
<BR>
is because you deserve it. Not a new position, but not defensible I think.
<BR>
<P>There are many ways that you could acquire money without deserving it as a
<BR>
&quot;thank you&quot;. Maybe this guy acquired a monopoly through foresight, and
<BR>
squeezed out all competition, ripped of his customers, and generally,
<BR>
although arguably deserving some reward, managed to reap benefits far out of
<BR>
proportion of his actual social benefit. Or perhaps he is a blithering
<BR>
idiot, who's best idea of a good time is eating human livers (?!?!?!?), who
<BR>
inherited enormous wealth. Maybe he piggy backed on someone elses' great
<BR>
work, managing to bump his partners out of the way at just the right moment.
<BR>
Perhaps he was one of the in crowd with some nepotistic banana republic's
<BR>
govt, and managed to squeeze billions out via massive corruption. Or any one
<BR>
of a zillion other ways of making vast sums of money.
<BR>
<P>And of course there is the inverse; people who really do add to society,
<BR>
without being rewarded appropriately. Examples would be lengthy and boorish;
<BR>
left as an exercise.
<BR>
<P>I was reading a PR textbook recently, where the writer was justifying the
<BR>
moral goodness of the existence of PR. His argument went something like
<BR>
this: Useful things are good. Useful things survive in the marketplace,
<BR>
non-useful things don't. PR survives, which means that PR is useful.
<BR>
Therefore PR is good.
<BR>
<P>I see parallels in the money morality above. It goes something like this:
<BR>
People deserve money in proportion to their goodness. People only get money
<BR>
as a result of doing beneficial things. Therefore, the more money people
<BR>
have, the &quot;gooder&quot; they are, and everything is golden sunshine. Right.
<BR>
<P>Really, I think money is awarded mostly, in it's really useful sized chunks,
<BR>
based on business acumen, and not much else. Business acumen is fine, great,
<BR>
I'm all for it, but it is the greatest of all virtues, that it should be
<BR>
awarded far out of proportion to any skill? Maybe it is.
