<EM>&gt; &gt; Do you agree that many animals are born with instincts?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Do you agree that these instincts are built into their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; brains by DNA?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but most aren't as high-level as &quot;big antlers&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you think an animal knows to have sex with something from its
<BR>
own race, rather than dogs trying to shag cats? It's all coded in there.
<BR>
Antlers is just part of it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; So why can't there also be instincts to want to have sex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with big antlers?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Encoding &quot;big antlers&quot; is more like encoding symphonies in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heartbeats than encoding a heart, and to do that you have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know a lot about the heart and a lot about music.  A useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutation occurring within the brain (at that level) has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be at least several orders of magnitude less likely than in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organs, limbs, and so on.  (And impossible if you think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain is just one big &quot;pattern catcher&quot;.)
</EM><BR>
<P>The brain obviously is not only a pattern catcher- there are
<BR>
structures even recognizable without a microscope. I won't go there.
<BR>
<P>DNA knows nothing (as if it were sentient, which is not), and doesn't
<BR>
have to know anything about the brain in order to code in these
<BR>
instincts. It just happens through evolution. And it's not like
<BR>
DNA has to start all over with each new branch of animal.. many
<BR>
of these instincts were evolved long before animals with antlers
<BR>
even existed. They just have very slight mods to the DNA of whatever
<BR>
they came from.
