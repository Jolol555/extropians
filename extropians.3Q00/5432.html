Cool show, although I do wonder whether the impetus for it was mainly due to
<BR>
trying to find a good use for too much footage of Robocup.
<BR>
<P>I hadn't seen a video of the Honda walking robot before; that's a truly
<BR>
amazing creation; the hairs rose on the back of my neck, watching it.
<BR>
<P>I was most interested in the blab about &quot;intelligent&quot; agent software on the
<BR>
net. It made out that these things are far more advanced than I had thought
<BR>
they were. I thought that agents were fairly pedestrian technology, but
<BR>
these guys implied it was real cutting edge stuff. Anyone got some
<BR>
experience in the area that they can share?
<BR>
<P>I really like seeing robotics people. They speak so seriously about the
<BR>
subject, but you can see they are a bunch of big kids, playing with (the
<BR>
world's coolest) toys. For example, they were interviewing a guy who makes
<BR>
automated systems for driving those enormous mining trucks around mines; a
<BR>
serious fellow, obviously very knowledgeable in his field, very credible.
<BR>
He's sitting in his office for the interview, and you can't help noticing
<BR>
the toy mining trucks on his bookshelf behind him. Erm, of course they are
<BR>
models, yes, models, um, important for, erm, research purposes. Yeah, right.
<BR>
I bet he makes Brrrm Brrrm noises as he drives them around his office. Hee
<BR>
hee.
<BR>
<P>Nice to see our man on the ground in fine form. Very nice plug there at the
<BR>
end of the panel discussion for the Singularity, btw. There was lots of
<BR>
interesting talk about the abilities of computers to attain human/animal
<BR>
level ability, the nature of consciousness, and all that good stuff
<BR>
(unfortunately marred by a large deal of input from the physiologist person
<BR>
who, with any luck, will end up being packed into a car by a car factory
<BR>
robot). All pretty standard stuff, nothing too outlandish or worrisome.
<BR>
Suddenly, our hero swoops in with the final comment, which I'll paraphrase:
<BR>
&quot;Of course, we must take into account the fact that there will be greater
<BR>
than human intelligence inside of 30 years on this planet, and that
<BR>
everything is going to hell in a handbasket, nothing will ever be the same
<BR>
again. Have a nice day.&quot; Well done, old bean.
<BR>
<P>Also, more astute viewers will not have failed to notice the energy with
<BR>
which our hero's remarks about emotions such as &quot;lust and hunger&quot; were leapt
<BR>
upon by the (xx chromosome) panel host. Lets have the goss!

<P><P><EM>&gt; For any Aussies who aren't so attached to the Olympics that they can't
</EM><BR>
bear
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to change away from Channel 7 (or whatever): I'll be taking part in an SBS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Insight discussion about the prospects of AI with cognitive philosopher Dr
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Peter Slezak (pro), animal-mind expert Dr Lesley Rogers (con, I suspect)*,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and one other, plus moderator. Somewhere in the usual 8.30-9.30 pm slot.
