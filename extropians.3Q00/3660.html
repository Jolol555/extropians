I had a chance to briefly meet Ralph Merkle last week at the Crypto
<BR>
conference.  (Ralph, in addition to being a nanotech pioneer, was
<BR>
a co-founder of public key cryptography back in the 1970s).  I know
<BR>
many list members know him, but I was suprised at how friendly and open
<BR>
he was.  I think we may have been the only two cryonics subscribers at
<BR>
the conference.
<BR>
<P>He was chatting about nano with some other folks, and there was discussion
<BR>
of the MEMS approach to nanotech (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems,
<BR>
basically microtech).  This is similar to the original Feynman conception,
<BR>
little tools which make smaller ones.  You'd use MEMS devices to help
<BR>
position, organize and convey the smaller nanotech elements which might
<BR>
be produced by conventional chemistry.
<BR>
<P>It's kind of a vague conception, but it is economically attractive
<BR>
because there are a lot of commercial applications for MEMS and they
<BR>
are technically feasible right now.  You could envision a succession of
<BR>
ever smaller MEMS devices until the field overlaps with nanotech.
