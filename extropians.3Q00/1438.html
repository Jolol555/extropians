<EM>&gt; &gt; No its not. A copyright is an unsigned social contract enforced by law,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; private use contracts where the parties explicitely agree to the terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prior to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the release of information are entirely different. Your failure to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this difference is exactly why you continue to try to argue these points.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I don't fail to understand this difference-- you just fail to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accept that I don't attribute your distinction with relevance to this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As you say: &quot;A copyright is an unsigned social contract enforced by law.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In essence it is a social agreement to attribute ownership and/or control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and/or rights of usage to an intellectual property.
</EM><BR>
<P>Signed to and agreed to by no one. In a free market society, only those
<BR>
who sign a contract wilfully and uncoerced can be bound by that
<BR>
contract. As I've said before, a social contract is merely a piece of
<BR>
paper they use to cover your eyes while they go for your wallet.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which is exactly what a private use contract between two parties would be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unlike your assertation above, they are -not- entirely different, in fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are fundamentally alike in terms of their nature-- they are arbitrary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agreements about the rights associated to a particular piece of information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or product.  They both propose to control your use and rights by recourse to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legal means.
</EM><BR>
<P>A private contract, wilfully assented to uncoerced by both parties is
<BR>
most definitely NOT at all like a social contract.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The reason I found it odd that you introduced the concept at all, is because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this reliance on the control of an individuals rights over their usage of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a piece of intellectual property.  A copyright law simply says that my ideas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are -always- protected---- independent of me signing an exclusive legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; document with you, I have ownership over what comes out of my head.  If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allow that it is in people's best interests to sign the sorts of contracts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you introduced to this discussion, (and if it wasn't a good idea to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make such a contract, why did you bring it up?) then it would therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follow that they would always be signing them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suppose a filmmaker then could just put up a webpage promoting a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movie-- and ask that prospective patrons sign a contract agreeing to pay for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; said movie if and when they decide to go see it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since most people would like to retain some sort of ownership over their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectual property, shouldn't we make that the default state?  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trivial for me to reliquish control over my intellectual property.  If there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are really advantages to the content being free, then people will pick up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that and make their content free.  Which they are already doing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, to be clear, if you grant that there is a good reason for us to sign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a contract restricting your use of my content, then you are recognizing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value of controlled usage and/or ownership.  Which is, of course, my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a value, but putting the burden of protecting that value on
<BR>
society, rather than on the artist, is a socialistic methodology. Its
<BR>
merely one more externalization of costs that is indicative that we live
<BR>
in a mercantilist economy rather than a free market. A libertarian
<BR>
society would properly put the burden of protecting that intellectual
<BR>
property on the creator or owner of that property.
<BR>
<P>Insisting that the artist pursue due diligence to ensure all recipients
<BR>
of value pay the fair market price for the value received minimizes the
<BR>
requirement for inefficient government law enforcement resources to be
<BR>
expended.
