*SJ Merc article snipped*
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Reason I consider this newsworthy: students throwing rocks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at each other is something that happens every day, but now we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a kid who has been arrested for assault, and was stupid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough to admit the reason he did it.  This changes everything,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and not just because it is an example of a thought-crime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Looks to me like any high school student can now stop any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beating or attack simply by saying &quot;Back off, Im gay.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If attacked, would I play the gay card?  In a heartbeat, yes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course it would work better if my wife of 16 years were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not present, but yes, if attacked, mugged or accosted in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any way, looks to me like the best defense is to claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be gay.  When I was in high school, such an admission
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have resulted in a beating, and there was no recourse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in those days.  Now, it will not take long for every criminal to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realize that any attack on a gay person means they will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be lucky to get off with just life without parole.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>*take sa deep breath*  Okay - let's consider where this is going.
<BR>
<P>Question:  How is this sort of an attack (singling out a student
<BR>
for having, or even simply SEEMING to have, a sexual orientation
<BR>
different from the attackers) any different from the lynchings of 
<BR>
the 1870s-1950s?  In those sorts of situations, people would be 
<BR>
killed by assemblies of the local township, organized into a mob,
<BR>
to right perceived wrongs - in one celebrated case making an ill-
<BR>
advised expression of attraction for a member of a race different 
<BR>
from his own.  
<BR>
<P>There is no way to ask this question without it being loaded, but
<BR>
let's put it as bluntly as possible:  When IS it okay to engage in 
<BR>
physical violence against another person based upon real, perceived, 
<BR>
or imagined differences?  I'm not talking about religious tracts and 
<BR>
pseudo-scientific literature &quot;proving&quot; the inferiority of members of
<BR>
one group or another - I am asking specfically about physical violence.
<BR>
<P>What is truly tragic here is not that the one boy is being held on 
<BR>
suspicion of assault - but that a (hypothetical) fight that took 
<BR>
place three days earlier didn't also result in arrests.
<BR>
<P>THe recent questions about libertarianism and such have given me an 
<BR>
insight (albeit still rather flawed) into the values many people here
<BR>
hold.  Whil eI don't always agree withthem, I admire the core goals and
<BR>
values highly.  Then something like this comes up, and I wonder how 
<BR>
reactionary and reaction-based people become over time.  Whenever a 
<BR>
prosecution based on &quot;hate crimes&quot; comes up, somehow it is suddenly
<BR>
an unfair application of the &quot;morals of the state&quot; to the private
<BR>
realm, with no equal examination to what we DO permit to happen without
<BR>
this pre-determined qualifying factor.  
<BR>
<P>I think we can mostly all agree that violence never really solves 
<BR>
any sort of conflict, and allowing a direct expression of violence can
<BR>
encourage further violent behavior in the future.  Where you wish to 
<BR>
stand on this is your own choice.
<BR>
<P>AS to where I stand on it, I will say I have no problems with the end
<BR>
result, though the vehicle is flawed beyond repair.  As a gay man 
<BR>
myself, it is nice to know that some of these laws arent' as toothless
<BR>
as has been threatened.  But the presence of hate crimes rules bothers
<BR>
me a lot as well.
<BR>
<P>I would rather that this sort of story wasn't even newsworthy, because
<BR>
this is the way we treat everyone who acts with unilateral violence 
<BR>
towards another.  Especially if we have taken away the ability of these
<BR>
victims to defend themselves.
