Robin -
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I was toying with putting together a simple game theory model of who went
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how low in this probability, as a function of preferences over having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lots of copies.  It would be a cute problem, but I just don't have the time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now - perhaps another day.
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder if you or Emlyn could explain why you want lots of copies.
<BR>
<P>We are of course equipped by our evolutionary heritage for a drive to
<BR>
reproduce, but for most people that is expressed more as a desire for sex,
<BR>
rather than a longing for reproduction in the abstract.  Our reproductive
<BR>
desires don't seem necessarily to translate into the kind of behavior
<BR>
which would cause rapid reproduction in the upload world.  No doubt over
<BR>
time, evolution operating on uploads would give them reproductive drives
<BR>
appropriate for that environment, though.
<BR>
<P>Are you just trying to short-circuit this process and adopt behaviors
<BR>
which evolution would eventually construct anyway?  Or do you find the
<BR>
prospect of copies of yourself pleasant in itself?
<BR>
<P>What about the fact that in your scenario, the quality of life of uploads
<BR>
is arguably much worse than for the rest of the world?  Why would you
<BR>
want to create countless copies of yourself which could find themselves
<BR>
mired in bonded servitude or even slavery, deprived of human rights,
<BR>
struggling with subsistence wages, facing a life of boredom as even
<BR>
the simplest advances or changes in society take subjective centuries
<BR>
to unfold?  It sounds like a pretty miserable existence.
<BR>
<P>Hal
