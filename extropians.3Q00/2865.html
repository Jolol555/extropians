<EM>&gt; I've always though I understood how switching/packing data worked on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internet, but maybe I'm missing something.  People keep talking about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how people can be tracked down using their IP number.  My question is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how so?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The IP address only tells the seeker what server you're logged into.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since you are probably one of at least a hundred other users at that IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address, how could anyone possibly identify you by IP address?
</EM><BR>
<P>Every individual is assigned a temporary dynamic IP address when logged
<BR>
into the server ( the server has to know which logged in user to send
<BR>
packets to), and keeps a log of what subscribers used what dynamic IP
<BR>
addresses for what period of time, and typically which modem on the ISP
<BR>
system they were logged in on. Checking the phone company records for
<BR>
that call, you can find out what phone number called into that modem,
<BR>
and what the location of that phone number is. If you are doing this
<BR>
while the caller is still logged in, you can test the signal for
<BR>
forwarding, to see if the signals are orginating there, or simply being
<BR>
forwarded from there, and if so where from, etc...

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
