I don't even have that story; what was the claim?
<BR>
<P><PRE>
--
<P>I'm a bit dismayed to find that more and more of my collegues don't drink
coffee, especially the young'uns. At the last office job I had, the IT
department's coffee percolator was broken; no one cared. The place was a bit
of a shambles, needless to say.
<P>A coder is a biological machine which converts caffeine into code. If the
first upload is a coder, a fun thing to do would be to stimulate the
simulated receptors which would react to caffeine in a bio human. Then run
for the hills.
<P>I have seen some coders trying to get by on Coke. Air is not a source of
oxygen if you are a fish, and Coke is not a source of caffeine if you are a
coder. Sysadmins drink Coke. Coders drinking Coke is like vampires feeding
from animal blood. Just kind of disgusting.
<P>I am reminded of the famous equation, was it Dijkstra? You know, Program =
Coder + Coffee. I've just recently realised the corollary to this; Good
Program = Good Coder + Good Coffee. Of course there's some room to move, you
can do Good Program = Crap Coder + Blue Mountain, or Good Program = Code God
+ instant (although you've gotta watch the subsequent rise in an already
monumental hourly rate which will follow).
<P>What's my point? I don't know, I'll go get coffee and see if that helps.
<P>Emlyn
<P>&gt; Actually, I think one of the most outrageous claims I've heard with regard
&gt; to software development was made with regard to personal coding rate by
&gt; Carl Feynman at Extro3.  Anyone else have good stories?
