<P><EM>&gt;&gt; &quot;Can our self-image of fuzzy free spirits long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;survive when the genome proves that life, at its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deepest level, is scripted by a logical program? The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;program's control is so tight that, as has long been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;known, a single error in the instructions can cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;malfunctions such as sickle-cell anemia and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hereditary diseases&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;the image becomes less like a rigidly engineered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;machine and more like a free-spirited dance when one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;considers transposons, or &quot;jumping genes.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think transposons leap about inside the differentiated cells of
<BR>
phenotypes, but rather during the formation of new germline cells - which
<BR>
case one `tight logical program' would be replaced by a minor variant.
<BR>
<P>More to point, I suspect, is that the `rigid coding' just sets the
<BR>
machinery in motion. Much of development is stochastic and/or
<BR>
selected/darwinnowed by exploratory activity within the local environment,
<BR>
especially in the immune system and the brain's neural organisation.
