Alzheimer's/
<BR>
<P>This week, two significant announcements were made at the World
<BR>
Alzheimer Congress, a gathering of more than 3,000 experts in
<BR>
Washington, D.C. On July 11, scientists at Elan Pharmaceuticals
<BR>
reported that a vaccine that reverses some of the effects of
<BR>
Alzheimer's has cleared its first test in humans. Since the first
<BR>
observation by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1906, researchers have long
<BR>
noted the presence of many beta amyloid plaques in the brain tissue
<BR>
of people who had died from Alzheimer's, though the exact cause of
<BR>
the disease remains unknown. This new vaccine works to clear these
<BR>
plaques out of the brain and prevent them from forming. Provided
<BR>
further clinical trials are successful, Elan hopes to begin mass
<BR>
marketing the vaccine within four to seven years. The day after this
<BR>
announcement, researchers from the New York University School of
<BR>
Medicine reported findings that suggest &quot;memantine, a drug that acts
<BR>
on a key central nervous system receptor, may help slow the
<BR>
progression of moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease.&quot; This
<BR>
is the first drug developed to date for these patients, who account
<BR>
for about one-third of all Alzheimer's sufferers. Memantine,
<BR>
researchers believe, works on the area of the brain that has to do
<BR>
with thinking and memory. Though currently available in Germany for
<BR>
dementia patients, further testing is required before Memantine can
<BR>
be approved for widespread use in the US.
