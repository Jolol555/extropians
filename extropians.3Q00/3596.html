<EM>&gt; As society becomes more transparent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the prudish must be displaced from positions of power, replaced by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  tolerant and cool.  This is kinda already happened in the Silicon Valley,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  the charge being led by those who started Apple.  spike

<EM>&gt; Spike, I'd like to think that this is automatically true, but I don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is.  Small rural communities were very transparent in the past, and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; weren't necessarily characterized by high levels of tolerance.  Check out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The Crucible&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ive another thought on this.  In historical transparent societies, one reason
<BR>
religious oppressors gained power is that the population consisted largely
<BR>
of farmers.  They tended to be superstitious, believing that if evil existed
<BR>
in the society, god would send plagues upon the sinners.  If god is plaguing
<BR>
the wicked neighbor, he will be pissed at you too, for allowing the wickedness
<BR>
to go on without stopping it.  Perhaps this time around we can at least be
<BR>
free of that notion.  Since everyone can see that surveillance equipment is
<BR>
getting faster, better, cheaper, ubiquitouser, etc, perhaps we can get our
<BR>
society to *wake up* in time to arrange for most tolerant, individualistic and
<BR>
freedom loving people among us be placed in positions of leadership.  spike
