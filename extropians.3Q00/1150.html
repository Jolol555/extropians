<P><EM>&gt; The claim I most want to focus attention on is this &quot;Corporate Uploads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Take Over Premise&quot;:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      Hardware and upload compilation will become cheap enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      profitably run uploads for lower than then-current wages when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      human labor is still highly valued (i.e., before strong AI),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      and substantially before most individuals can afford to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      non-destructively upload themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given this premise, most first uploads would be corporate projects,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and such uploads would have a first-mover advantage in filling niches.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the hardware becoming cheap enough to compete with humans
<BR>
will take a while.  It seems that it is human sensory equivalence
<BR>
that is driving the curve now (e.g. &quot;Leaving Moore's Law in the Dust&quot; by
<BR>
Dori Jones Yang, Newsweek, July 10, 2000), esp. for things like 3D graphics.
<BR>
Once parity is achieved there, it will be human augmentation (net-to-brain
<BR>
links) that will be the drivers (because we will be constrained by
<BR>
the slow bandwidth in our I/O devices).   So any uploads will be competing
<BR>
with augmented humans which is going to make their operating costs
<BR>
and performance requirements even more difficult.
<BR>
<P>To get the hardware &quot;cheap enough&quot;, you need a driver for the research
<BR>
required to quickly advance the curve on what is likely to be highly
<BR>
special purpose hardware.  I'd guess you need a dozen university
<BR>
and/or industry teams working on DeGaris like strategies.  Given
<BR>
the Blue Gene effort is budgeted at $100M and the quantities of
<BR>
money floating around now-a-days, a $1B effort doesn't seem
<BR>
too unreasonable.  However that should be balanced against
<BR>
things like the National Ignition Facility which in spite
<BR>
of careful planning and relatively mature technologies looks
<BR>
like it is going to cost several billion $ more than was expected.
<BR>
Project management for results still seems to be more of an art
<BR>
than a science.
<BR>
<P>I agree that uploads, especially if you can remove the consciousness,
<BR>
would make an ideal &quot;killer app&quot;.  What corporate president wouldn't
<BR>
want to just make copies of his best engineers?  At the same time it
<BR>
is going to be a very risky proposition until we have more fundamental
<BR>
knowledge on how the brain works.  Projects of the required size are
<BR>
going to be hard to keep secret.  That means you have to tell the
<BR>
board, the board will float it by the investment community.  The
<BR>
investment community will go, &quot;great idea&quot; until someone realizes
<BR>
what it means if the upload is an individual with their specific
<BR>
skill base...  As much as people like the idea of making millions
<BR>
off of their investments, they don't like the idea of 10, 20, 30
<BR>
years of education and experience being made obsolete next year.
<BR>
<P>It looks to me like this is a variant of the why don't we just
<BR>
build a &quot;factory factory&quot; problem, only instead of factories it
<BR>
is information management &amp; creativity that you are cloning.
<BR>
<P>It does sounds like you need an idea future for this specific scenario.
