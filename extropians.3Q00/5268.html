&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeaaa &quot;David Lubkin&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lubkin@unreasonable.com?Subject=Re:%20Raising%20children,%20spouses,%20and%20friends&In-Reply-To=&lt;200009191503.JAA17715@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">lubkin@unreasonable.com</A>&gt;, this is my
<BR>
favorite topic.  I've tried to bring it up before, ask if anyone else
<BR>
is bringing children to an extro conference and stuff but have never
<BR>
noticed much interrest.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was raised in the Mormon Church and more or less left that
<BR>
for extropianism.  My wife and kids are still very staunch Mormons and
<BR>
just barely tolerant of my non LDS ways.  But I am working on
<BR>
converting them as best as is possible.  I'd love to have something at
<BR>
an extropian conference that I could bring some of my 3 children (10,
<BR>
12, and 14) too.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm constantly working on converting friends too.  But
<BR>
converting always seems very futile.  I think I've been extropian all
<BR>
my life and could never really believe in anything else and most other
<BR>
people (both theist and atheist alike) seem non extropian (deathists?)
<BR>
their entire life and never interrested.  I have meat a few friends
<BR>
that were, like me, extropian from birth (they just didn't know what
<BR>
to call themselves until they found the extropy institute.)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Mormon church I was raised to be a &quot;missionary&quot; trying
<BR>
to bring &quot;salvation&quot; to everyone.  Now that I've found extropianism
<BR>
I've realized that religion, counter to it's promises, is just worship
<BR>
of death.  Science/rationalism is the only possibility for progress,
<BR>
eternal life...  So I've attempted to convert my missionary upbringing
<BR>
to being a missionary for extropianism.  I'm still trying to &quot;save the
<BR>
world&quot; but I just now know that rationalism, not some crucified
<BR>
character..., is what is required to do it all.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spend much time trying to spread extropianism and rational
<BR>
faith and hope memes.  But current human minds don't seem to be very
<BR>
good hosts for such memes for some reason.  But once science starts
<BR>
getting close to finding a cure for aging, then things will really
<BR>
take off, I think.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could catch kids when they are young, like the theists
<BR>
do, I bet we could be much more successful at propagating extropian
<BR>
memes than Christians are at propagating their memes.  Today's
<BR>
deathist society just makes human children unable to tolerate many
<BR>
extropian beliefs once they get into and beyond the teen years.
<BR>
