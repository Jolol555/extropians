<P><EM> &gt; I don't think most people are ready to kill.  I don't think they are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; prepared to personally take a human life.  From what I've read, for most
</EM><BR>
<P>That's true, but this is something which can be trained.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; people (not all) this is a tremendously traumatic experience.  To kill
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a human being carries the ultimate degree of finality.  You take away
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; everything he will ever have and will ever be.  There is no chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; reconciliation, no chance of recovery, no chance of reparing the damage
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; which has been done and beginning to start anew.  It's over, permanently
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and forever.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I don't think such philosophical ruminations occupy a major part of
<BR>
your mind when you're being mugged. I suspect you're just scared
<BR>
shitless, period. Muggings and most of violet crime requires this
<BR>
frozen rigid/literally scared out of your wits behaviour to occur in
<BR>
order to be successfull.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; It seems to me that preparing yourself psychologically for this action
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; requires a certain amount of distancing and depersonalizing your
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; attitudes towards other people.  You can't think of your target as a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; human being with hopes and aspirations, struggling under the weight of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; damaging experiences and harmful thoughts.  He needs to be thought of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; impersonally, as a threat to be eliminated.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
The only mental decision you have to do is whether to allow reflexes 
<BR>
to take over, or not.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; impersonal and hard-hearted?  Might they not face a burden in setting up
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; alliances and working together with other people, compared to those who
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are more trusting, open and accepting of human limitations and weaknesses?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Like those neo-nazis which baseballbat people to death in plain view
<BR>
of other citizens, who are too scared to intervene, for fear of being
<BR>
killed or seriously wounded?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Taking the responsibility of carrying a gun is going to change you.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; It forces you to think of yourself as a killer, as one who is willing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to kill.  Admittedly, if you actually save your life by carrying the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; gun then any costs it imposes are worthwhile.  But the chance that you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; will actually be killed by violence are highly remote.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It highly depends on where you live and which areas you frequent
<BR>
when. A young black in a bad neighborhood is probably more likely to
<BR>
die of acute lead poisoning than of anything else.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Given the very small probability of this outcome, the costs in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of your alienation from society must be considered significant.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; long run your survival prospects will be hurt by having a lesser degree
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of social connectivity.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's a private decision.
