<P>&lt;&lt; Huh? Gamma rays do not distort radio waves, and in fact for 40 years we've 
<BR>
had
<BR>
&nbsp;radio telescopes that could communicate with a similar instrument anywhere in
<BR>
&nbsp;the galaxy; if another one actually existed elsewhere course. Use a good 
<BR>
error
<BR>
&nbsp;correcting code and you'd have very few errors. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Jamming, by natural or deliberate inception is assuredly well-know phenomena, 
<BR>
such solar storms, military broadcasts etc. If one sends an &quot;archived&quot; 
<BR>
message em signals of all types including gammma ray photons could 
<BR>
conceivably blow parts of a sustained message away. Astronomers are now 
<BR>
looking at anomolous intersteller gas-dust clouds as an excellent filter of 
<BR>
many signals, including the possibility of ETI signals. We have just had (for 
<BR>
40 years) the experience of receiving signals, because the testing of sending 
<BR>
signals has not been a technologically achivable option yet :) i.e we have no 
<BR>
large receiveing antena even circling the Oort cloud to confirm how well 
<BR>
signals travel.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;For example, look at all the mighty gas giants detected around many of the 
<BR>
nearer stars. We have never been able to receive these signals, as we known 
<BR>
Jupiter is capable of, from interstellar distances. Theoretically if we had 
<BR>
better radio telescopes we might be able to detect such signals buy 
<BR>
electronically screening out the interference, from their parent star. Gas 
<BR>
giants like Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune have enough radioactive energy to 
<BR>
put out a whoppingly large broadcast!  
<BR>
<P>As for neutrinos-they penetrate everything, almost. They are therefore 
<BR>
coherent. At least until tachyonic signal is achived. We may have to wait on 
<BR>
that one for a bit.
