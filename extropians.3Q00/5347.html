<EM>&gt;I've noticed that *very* few of us have publicly
</EM><BR>
mentioned having children.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;(Me, Barbara, Keith Henson, Sasha, Minsky, uh...)
</EM><BR>
<P>I've got three, two girls 17 13 and an 11 year old
<BR>
son.
<BR>
<P>My kids have been forced by their other parent to go
<BR>
to church every weekend they don't spend with me, but
<BR>
they have a healthy skepticism about all things &quot;god&quot;
<BR>
that they learned at their Mother's (ok it was father
<BR>
back then, but I was in the &quot;mother&quot; role) knee.
<BR>
<P>I learned loads about raising kids from my parents...
<BR>
mostly how NOT to do things.
<BR>
<P>I've been surprised by several people recently who are
<BR>
very pro-tech / anti-death and aware of nano, ai, gene
<BR>
mod etc...  The singularity is generally a new concept
<BR>
for them however.
<BR>
<P>Intelligent people with little emotional investment in
<BR>
a religion seem to be the most receptive... while the
<BR>
god squad looks at me like =I'm= crazy.
