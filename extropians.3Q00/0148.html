<P>
Why don't I move to the US?
<BR>
<P>Well, I've asked myself that many times now, and while visiting the 
<BR>
Libertarian Party in the US last August one of them said to me: &quot;Waldemar, 
<BR>
you'll go nuts if you stay in Sweden. I predict you'll be living in America 
<BR>
within five years&quot;. Perhaps she was right, but I also see that the 
<BR>
difference between Sweden and the US is unfortunately just a matter of 
<BR>
degree, not in fundamentals. I see the same problems in the US. I see that 
<BR>
Americans don't have the right to their property either, and are dependent 
<BR>
in a great deal on their government. That others in American do see me as a 
<BR>
slave that should work for their benefit. Americans will certainly not want 
<BR>
to change a system that while impoverishing them still feels necessary, 
<BR>
otherwise others will take away what is &quot;theirs&quot;, the same type of gloom as 
<BR>
in Sweden. That stasism is unfortunately alive and well too. That American 
<BR>
society is also based on coercion,  that a political machine is well 
<BR>
entrenched in the US too, and the same kind of legalised warfare between 
<BR>
pressure groups is present. People are also hard pressed by taxes, and kept 
<BR>
inactive by a corporativist system. It is very difficult for America too, to 
<BR>
change course since government is in the best interest of very powerful 
<BR>
pressure groups that seek to increase their influence on others' expenses, 
<BR>
and the problem increases. The American government tends to grow, and its 
<BR>
inefficiencies are not dependant on &quot;paperwork&quot; but the structural 
<BR>
fallancies of centralized government, problems that show themselves in in 
<BR>
the activities of the government, giving people no choice or good service, 
<BR>
and of course the corruption and centralization of power that follows in its 
<BR>
footsteps.
<BR>
<P>But really, these problems are common in all countries, because the ruling 
<BR>
elite has basically followed the same ideas. In order to open up Sweden I 
<BR>
have to open up the world. In America I would get some opportunities more, 
<BR>
but the struggle would be the same. In Sweden smaller steps will generate 
<BR>
more, relatively speaking.
<BR>
<P>Act globally, think locally!
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Waldemar
