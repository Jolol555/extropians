Ron H. wrote, quoting Hal:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Democracy just means rule by the people.  I don't see anything in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  definition which specifies that minorities' rights have to be respected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The American democracy initially allowed slavery, and I think the ancient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Greek version did as well.   Hal  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thank you, I just wanted to know what you were advocating.
</EM><BR>
<P>I should make it clear that I am not advocating democracy.  I was
<BR>
objecting to Samantha's comparison of capitalism to democracy.  She seemed
<BR>
to be using democracy as positive example.  My point was that democracy
<BR>
is a highly imperfect system, and that comparing capitalism to democracy
<BR>
actually degrades capitalism.
