<P>deja is an email server that does not verify the identities of its
<BR>
users, which the poster probably knew. However, if it is possible, I'll
<BR>
put up $100.00 to whoever comes up with the identity of the bastard. My
<BR>
personal suspicion is that its one of our old friends that we had a
<BR>
little trouble with some time ago who made other accusations of Max. Its
<BR>
the same MO, likely the same perpetrator.

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
