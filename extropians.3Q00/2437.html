<P><EM>&gt;Does anyone here know the exact details of what paperwork is legally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;required to create a fellowship?  For example, do I need to file a W-4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with SingInst so that SingInst can withhold tax from fellowship
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;payments?  Do I need to calculate and send taxes myself on a quarterly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basis?  Or do I just calculate and pay my taxes at the end of the year?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If I'm not going to be an employee, are things like health insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deductible from my taxable income?  And so on.
</EM><BR>
<P>With my fellowship, I have to pay my own taxes.  Neither my school nor
<BR>
the funder files tax forms for me.  I've been told the IRS doesn't
<BR>
enforce this too well, since they don't get any forms; but I paid anyway
<BR>
since I have moderately complex taxes and suspect I may get audited
<BR>
someday.  
<BR>
<P>Quarterly vs. annually depends on how much you owe.  Macintax says I 
<BR>
needn't file estimates with my current situation but that's probably
<BR>
influenced by some part-time work I've done for the University. The
<BR>
Feds grossly overwithold for work done only part of the year.
<BR>
Computer tax programs can estimate your need for estimated payments,
<BR>
based on your projected income.
<BR>
<P>Medical expenses are only deductable if they exceed some portion of 
<BR>
your income - 7%, I think.  In general, tax-favored benefits can only
<BR>
come from companies.  You can, however, write off a lot of work-related
<BR>
expenses.
