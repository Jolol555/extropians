<BR>
<EM>&gt; I am against all war, including the US involvement in the Kosovo War.
</EM><BR>
That
<BR>
<EM>&gt; one was kinda tricky because the notion was that by intervening, more
</EM><BR>
lives
<BR>
<EM>&gt; were saved than were lost.  I sure hope that is true,
</EM><BR>
<P>That is one of the points in dispute here.  That so few died in Kosovo
<BR>
before the bombing (a few dozen) and so many after (thousands), kind of
<BR>
points to that justification for the war being wrong -- at least from its
<BR>
aftermath, though a lot of this could have been predicted beforehand.  Also,
<BR>
the tactics used in diplomacy beforehand, make me think that the US
<BR>
government wanted a war.  Finally, the more evidence I look at during the
<BR>
Balkan wars of the 1990s, the more I see Serbia being demonized while every
<BR>
other nation of group is given a free pass on judgment.  I've already
<BR>
mentioned Croatia enough times here.  No one has refuted my claims.  The
<BR>
same seems also true of Bosnia, where Bosnian Muslim forces used UN
<BR>
protection to attack the Serbs.
<BR>
<P>That said, I don't want to whitewash any side in the conflict, but it's
<BR>
strange that when all sides are commiting atrocities that only one side gets
<BR>
singled out and takes all the blame.  That only reinforces the notion that
<BR>
if you have the better publicists (Serbia, notably, has failed to publicize
<BR>
its case as the Bosnian Muslims and Kosovar Albanians have) and allies, you
<BR>
can do what you want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; however I would prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to see peace achieved by having all countries owning outrageously advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defense technologies, that make them too expensive to attack.  In the long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run machines are very cheap compared to war.  I am interested in seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the development of weapons that can *only* be used to defend, but are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; useless for attack.  Such things exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>It sounds like a nice science fiction story, but I don't think it will work.
<BR>
A purely defensive weapon almost sounds impossible.  For instance, heavy
<BR>
machine guns (e.g., M-60) are better for defense than attack, but can be
<BR>
used for both.  Also, any defensive weaponry can be used to cover attacks --
<BR>
as machine guns are used to defend positions from which other forces attack.
<BR>
<P>This is not to say defensive weaponry and strategies shouldn't be developed,
<BR>
but rather that I don't think they are a cure all for war.  They just make
<BR>
it more costly, which is, in most cases, a good thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another reason that war was difficult was that it was an internal
</EM><BR>
conflict.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Even libertarians have a hard time seeing what is the right thing to do
</EM><BR>
there.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Im open to suggestion.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P>My view here is I don't have a solution, but it's easy to see what is not a
<BR>
solution -- or what makes things worse.  I think a lot of people start here
<BR>
thinking they can solve these problems and that one of the various sides
<BR>
(the KLA, the Bosnian Muslim government, the Croatians, etc.) want a just
<BR>
solution and that none of the sides is able to manipulate the solver or
<BR>
thwart the solution.  This is exactly the sentiment of the people in the US
<BR>
government, from President Bush on down, who wanted to get involved in
<BR>
Somalia.
<BR>
<P>Also, among Americans, there is the romance of coercion.  They tend, sadly,
<BR>
on the whole to think force always works.  (This is also a bad lesson to
<BR>
teach the world: to use force in conflicts.)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
