<P>
Hal, David, Doug,
<BR>
<P>While murder stats are one way to look at the personal defense issue,
<BR>
shouldn't the larger issue encompass events worse than death? For example:
<BR>
the aftermath of violent crime against one's person where some essential
<BR>
part of one's life has been taken and cannot be restored.
<BR>
<P>Protecting myself from this variety of suffering has a higher priority than
<BR>
protecting myself from an instant and painless end. For example, if a
<BR>
perp's goal were to torture or main or even if he* were to merely threaten
<BR>
me with the perception of these events, I would be prepared to defend
<BR>
myself in the extreme. In other words, I would not co-operate, I would
<BR>
kill. (This is a fairly new way of thinking for me.)
<BR>
<P>I'd be interested to know how other females regard such threats of
<BR>
violence. Women who 'fight back' are much more likely to survive / escape.
<BR>
Co-operating with some psychopath rapist is more likely to get you dead.
<BR>
<P>Hal asked:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Would they even go to the point that they would support the death penalty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for robbery?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you mean a type of robbery that results in extreme trauma and suffering
<BR>
with fallout so severe a life impedient that the victim's prior life cannot
<BR>
be restored, then, yes, let the death penalty be considered.
<BR>
<P>David comments:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;- - The criminal knows that you are armed, so preys on others instead. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;altercation &gt;between you is avoided altogether. (See Bastiat, &quot;What Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Seen And What Is Not Seen&quot;.)  &gt;If enough people are armed, the criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;finds something else to do for a living.
</EM><BR>
<P>So, criminals look for victims who won't put up a defensive fuss, that is:
<BR>
the unwarry, naive, physically weak, defenseless...    women and children?
<BR>
<P>Doug writes:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Laser sights on a handgun tend to make it a better persuader- seeing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spot on one's groin makes even the most aggressive attacker think twice,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by making the promise &quot;I will maim you&quot; instead of &quot;I will kill you,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;introducing a shade of gray into the life or death equation.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maiming potential of a sword is what gives it its psychological power,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but Aleta was fortunate the perps did not have firearms.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly the point: It's not the threat of instant death that deters, it's
<BR>
the very idea of violence against one's person that stops us all in our
<BR>
tracks.
<BR>
<P>~ankara
<BR>
<P>(he* - offensive violent crime is almost exclusively a male domain.)
