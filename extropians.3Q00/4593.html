<EM>&gt; who are truly bums, unwilling to work because most can scam better

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wage...
</EM><BR>
<P>The latest societal convulsion in the SF Bay area has created
<BR>
some oddities.  During the bad old days of the late 80s, we
<BR>
had a great number of signers: these guys holding signs insisting
<BR>
that they would WORK for FOOD, etc.
<BR>
<P>Well, unfortunately for them, prosperity intervened (Clintonomics?)
<BR>
and even they must have recognized the absurdity of the notion,
<BR>
holding such a sign on the street corner, when all the local fast
<BR>
food places had *permanently mounted* their HELP WANTED
<BR>
signs in the window.
<BR>
<P>Last year, the government issued a very large number of visas,
<BR>
to pretty much anyone who could pay taxes on 60k, which is
<BR>
just about the starting wage around here for anyone who can
<BR>
place one line of code in front of another, so as one might
<BR>
suspect we had a massive influx, which caused the apartment
<BR>
vacancy rate to drop to a few parts per million, which caused
<BR>
the rent prices to skyrocket to the point that the &quot;homeless-
<BR>
will-work-for-food&quot;ers were in danger of actually becoming
<BR>
literally without a home.
<BR>
<P>All the local fast food joints have raised the starting wage to
<BR>
about $9/hour, still not really competitive with what the
<BR>
signers can earn, but as high as they can pay selling 3 dollar
<BR>
hamburgers, but at $9/hour a person would need to work
<BR>
60 hours a week to cover the rent alone on a typical studio
<BR>
apartment in Sunnyvale, consequentemente...
<BR>
the employees leave.
<BR>
<P>Then, the fast food joints start asking their employees to
<BR>
work longer hours, forgetting why people take those jobs
<BR>
in the first place: they allow people to work part time.  When
<BR>
they are asked to work full time, they figure they might as
<BR>
well get a *real* job, which they do, and now the Burger
<BR>
King is in even worse straits.
<BR>
<P>The will-work-for-fooders stand out there on the corner,
<BR>
with all limbs in apparent working condition, while Burger
<BR>
King is *crying out* for someone willing to just push a
<BR>
mop and wipe tables.  And they will hire *anyone* no
<BR>
questions asked, dog kickers, mass murderers, whatever.
<BR>
They hire the mentally retarded, but oddly enough, there
<BR>
arent enough of them either.  And the fast food gets steadily
<BR>
slower, because there arent enough people working the
<BR>
kitchen.  Meanwhile the floors and tables get ever dirtier.
<BR>
<P>Engineering teams dissolve because the young PhDs
<BR>
cannot afford the rent.  Those who argue that National
<BR>
Missile Defense is an impossible task never do site the
<BR>
*real* most difficult hurdle facing it: keeping teams together
<BR>
in areas that are too expensive for those working the project.
<BR>
For those who have managed to acquire a home, of course,
<BR>
it is like winning the lottery in slow motion.
<BR>
<P>So here in Silicon Valley we see a foretaste of a future
<BR>
in which wealth is distributed ever more based on technical
<BR>
ability and insight, steadily less on the number of hours worked.
<BR>
I can see that what must happen here is that the techno-have-nots
<BR>
must abandon the valley, being replaced in the short run by
<BR>
commuters from the outlying areas, these being replaced in
<BR>
the long run by androids.  All this looks great from the point
<BR>
of view of a techno-have, but I can scarcely imagine the
<BR>
anguish of the other half.  My solution is to not be one of
<BR>
them.  Other ideas?  spike
