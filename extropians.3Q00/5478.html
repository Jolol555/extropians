<P><P>I think I mumbled at FoRK that I'd bailed my .com dayjob earlier this summer.
<BR>
A couple of you even know what I've been toiling away on.  It's now official.
<BR>
I can tell people. 
<BR>
<P>Here's the more general 'really rough announcement' that I whipped off to a 
<BR>
few friends a few minutes ago.
<BR>
<P><P>--- Cut here --
<BR>
<P><P><P>Art should be free. Artists should be paid.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OpenCulture helps make it possible to make works of art like books
<BR>
and music freely available on the Internet, while making sure that the
<BR>
artists who created them actually get compensated.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we initially came up with the idea for OpenCulture.org, it 
<BR>
seemed neat, but there wasn't much incentive for the public or for writers
<BR>
and musicians to embrace a whole new system of compensating artists for making 
<BR>
their works available on the net.  Then napster happened.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OpenCulture.org is a new sort of digital library and publishing 
<BR>
company rolled into one.  We allow artists to get paid to give away the 
<BR>
books and music they create _before_ they have to make those works available 
<BR>
to the Internet.  We've spent the summer putting the company together and 
<BR>
starting to build out the legal and financial frameworks we'll need to make 
<BR>
this happen on a large scale.  Right now, we're gearing up to build out the
<BR>
technical infrastructure to allow artists to list works with us.  We expect
<BR>
that to be in place by the end of the year.
<BR>
