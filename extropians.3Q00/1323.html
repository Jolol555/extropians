I think you are right, especially with the recently proposed legislation
<BR>
to track international transfers more closely. That is pretty scary stuff!
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, as you point out we have Havenco. True they are in a
<BR>
very iffy situation with the UK, but I posted earlier today regarding the
<BR>
fact that some parts of the UK do consider it to be a separate country.
<BR>
We'll have to see how that plays out. But they aren't waiting around- if
<BR>
you read the article on /. a week or so ago, they talk about branching
<BR>
out to multiple other physical locations pretty soon. And they have enough
<BR>
$$$ backing them to make it work I think. So let's assume for the moment
<BR>
that the succeed in establishing a real live datahaven.
<BR>
<P>What does that mean for us? Well for starters you can definitely setup
<BR>
an anonymous account with them, pay them anonymously (through cash if
<BR>
necessary.. I get the feeling they are still working this part out), and
<BR>
using freedom.net software or other means access your server anonymously.
<BR>
So if you want to setup some kind of service there to escape rules in
<BR>
your home country, it should be easy to do as long as you only need
<BR>
electronic data flow. If you have some kind of business that requires
<BR>
paper docs/mail service you can't do it yet.
<BR>
<P>What someone needs to do is setup a bank on Havenco. Then you could
<BR>
wire your money from the US to that bank, and from that point on tell
<BR>
the IRS whatever you want (we are talking theoretically here kiddies
<BR>
at home) on your tax return. This bank account could probably be used
<BR>
to open an account with a US stock brokerage, and again using the
<BR>
freedom software you could anonymously trade.. transfer your profits
<BR>
occasionally back to the bank account, and from there to your US
<BR>
bank account. You could tell the IRS you don't know who these magic
<BR>
payments come from, perhaps a secret admirer :-) And voila, no more
<BR>
capital gains taxes.
<BR>
<P>It would appear from my point of view that something like Havenco
<BR>
might be what allows us to finally have what you discuss. You just
<BR>
have to have the balls (so to speak) to actually make use of it.
<BR>
And a good lawyer probably.

<EM>&gt; In the face of recent news, its sometimes hard to be optimistic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whatever happened to private e-cash?  You know, that thing that was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promoted optimistically within extropian circles.  It seems everyone who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tried it folded up.  Worse still, people like the Dept of the Treasury,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; IRS, World Bank and others are actively attempting to prohibit its use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But even it were legal, most organizations capable of implementing it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have no interest in doing so - like Visa, MC, American Express.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would rather our transactions remain open to scrutiny for marketing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes.  The government wants money to remain in their control for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ostensible purpose of tracking drug traffickers, money launders and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terrorists.  Also recent legislation is passing through congress to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; re-enact the &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; plan for international transactions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem here, is once the system is in place to track that, its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; becomes that much easier for them to implement it domestically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem  I see ultimately, is this allows the governments of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world to continue increasing their power at the expense of individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; liberty.  Previous talk about how network economics would ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumvent the state and render it powerless have failed to materialize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least in the US.  Perhaps this occurred on the scale of large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporations, but again this seems to have happened at the expense of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual liberty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course some people will say &quot;Hey, now we have HavenCo&quot;.  But just the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other day, one of its chief engineers was barred from entering the UK.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not optimistic this company will last very long.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe I'm missing the big picture here.  Does anybody think overall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual liberty is increasing, particularly for US Citizens, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decreasing?  Please be as specific as possible.
