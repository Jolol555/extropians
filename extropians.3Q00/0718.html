<BR>
<P>I keep reading this strange argument, but I can't understand why. Unless
<BR>
you factor in some advantages from sexual re-mixing of
<BR>
immunity/anti-parasite armaments, this mostly makes no sense to me (with
<BR>
one exception, below).
<BR>
<P>*Everyone* has a chance of getting eaten within a given year, or a day. The
<BR>
young are, if anything, *more vulnerable*.
<BR>
<P>On one hand you have a critter that's roughly as good as any other critter
<BR>
of its kind, including its own offspring (which, after all, resemble it
<BR>
quite closely). If it remains fertile and healthy, it is as fine an
<BR>
instance of its kind as any of its kids. What's more, due to its history of
<BR>
learning it's *better* - unless it has learned the wrong things, but is
<BR>
error more hazardous than blind trial and error in the utterly ignorant or
<BR>
gene-programmed? It's also bigger and stronger.
<BR>
<P>On the other hand, you have a swarm of spawn, innocent, comparatively
<BR>
frail, but with their cellular clocks reset and their bods therefore
<BR>
lacking the damage due to an accumulation of insults and injuries. This
<BR>
method might bypass any need for specialised maintenance machinery outside
<BR>
the germ cells, and since offspring are more numerous (usually) than their
<BR>
progenitors they might have more chance of surviving random predation.
<BR>
However, the triage rates among offspring suggest that this is not
<BR>
necessarily a superior path. I'd go for just plain surviving, and getting
<BR>
big and canny about your environment and enemies.
<BR>
<P>So there's no obvious advantage, to the embodied gene complex, in disposing
<BR>
of a trained, fertile soma - *unless* the costs of maintaining its numerous
<BR>
and specialised tissues are very much greater than throwing an adult soma
<BR>
away and starting with ignorant near-copies with the key benefit of a
<BR>
re-set self-repairing phase.
<BR>
<P>It seems to come back to the issue of disseminated maintenance mechanisms.
<BR>
And if they don't exist in nature, we'll have to develop them, along the
<BR>
lines of Freitas's suggestions with hard nanogadgets or maybe using
<BR>
synthetic chromosomes packed with repair kits - which, sadly for us, would
<BR>
most easily be introduced into embryos rather than decaying adults...
