<EM>&gt; &gt; Thats why if you go to church on Sunday, totally ignorant that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not, in fact, the Sabbath, and do not follow the law of the Sabbath on Saturday,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; then you are not in fact breaking the second commandment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The second commandment?  The one about graven images?  Or are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you one of those that combines the first two, so that the second is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about that name in vain business?  Is it not strange that everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinks there are ten commandments, but when you actually read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Exodus chapter 20, there are clearly 11 of them?  Eliezer, what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say ye?
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, there are ten, the Catholic church just did away with the original 2nd
<BR>
commandment (which commands that you hold the sabbath holy and not do anything
<BR>
on that day), and then split the tenth in two to cover their asses. Originally,
<BR>
the tenth was both the 'shall not covet thy neighbors wife' and 'covet they
<BR>
neighbors stuff', but the Catholic church split it up.
<BR>
Where do you think they would get the authority to do such a thing? Well, since
<BR>
the Xman allegedly delegated Peter to found his Church, the Pope is considered,
<BR>
at least by catholics, to be the big man's 'vice regent' on earth and as such is
<BR>
empowered to even change the bible, including times to worship... all of this is
<BR>
the sort of stuff that many of the more anti-catholic protestants use to fit in
<BR>
with their 'whore of babylon' interpretation of the prophesies of Daniel and of
<BR>
John (which are both pretty consistent with each other) to apply to the Catholic
<BR>
church, where they claim that worshipping on Sunday, i.e. worshipping the sun
<BR>
(the prince of light, i.e. lucifer) is the mark of the beast, and only those who
<BR>
still worship only on Saturday retain the Seal of God.
<BR>
<P>(I get all this from some pretty obnoxious anti-papist literature some outfit in
<BR>
Oklahoma stuffed in my mailbox as junk mail, not realizing that I was raised
<BR>
Catholic).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; However, now that I've told you, you have no such excuse...bwahahahaha!!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have used this on visiting jehovahs witnesses.  I ask what percentage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the neighborhood heeds their proselytizing.  If they are honest, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will say a fraction of a percent.  Then I ask if they are not causing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eternal destruction of the remaining 99+ percent.  They usually shake
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the dust off their feet as they leave.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Never hurts to make THEM feel guilty.
