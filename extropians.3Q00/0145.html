</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Remember the basic principles of the welfare state: people are too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; stupid,  weak and evil to decide for themselves. It is better if a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; technocratic elite  does it in their place. Really, if something is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; an opposition to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transhumanism it is the welfare and the attitudes it spread in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; population.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I disagree. While that may be the case in regards to Extropianism, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see nothing in transhumanism in general that is at odds with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concepts of central planning, wealth redistribution, and the Welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;State as we know it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Just the tiny problem that the above is at odds with the basic philosophical 
<BR>
assumptions of transhumanism. It isn't practical, neither is it moral since 
<BR>
it assumes a quite different view upon humans and their abilities. Central 
<BR>
planning, wealth redistribution and the artistocratic welfare state is a 
<BR>
very conservative idea, it implies that people are basically unable to 
<BR>
control their own lives. It isn't about improvement, it is about keeping 
<BR>
people on a certain level (this a rather friendly interpretation). An expert 
<BR>
can do it better, and if people start experimenting with their lives they 
<BR>
will fail. Centralism has shown its fallancies time and time again, since it 
<BR>
is riddled with a massive problem of information. It always tries to 
<BR>
simplify questions in order to put them into their system, so that they can 
<BR>
be processed. If the central bureaucracy doesn't condone a specific 
<BR>
transhumanist technique no one must be able to do it. In a free society a 
<BR>
variety of options are made possible, a plurality of agents may seek out a 
<BR>
number of possible solutions. Of course, this doesn't sit well in a society 
<BR>
riddled by expertoitis, where an elite of experts think themselves as higher 
<BR>
than the strange spontanous way to solve problems of the market, eventhough 
<BR>
it can process more information than a central bureaucracy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In the welfare state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you don't have the economic resources to be innovative, people in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the  welfare states are poor- the government is rich.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've always been interested in the perceived dichotomy among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;libertarians between the government and the people. Surely the people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are the ones who make up the government? And I take issue with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;notion that all innovation comes from individuals; groups (whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they be private associations, corporations, or the government) are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just as capable of technological and social innovation as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals. Moreso; because they have the ability to concentrate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resources in a rational manner to achieve a specific goal. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want to get from point A to point B, better one sled team moving as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unit than a pack of wild dogs roaming willy-nilly.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe because you a raising a pseudo- question. Libertarianism isn't 
<BR>
atomist, quite the contrary. It is the WILLING, uncoerherced cooperation 
<BR>
between individuals that is cherised. But libertarians do remember that 
<BR>
there are no holistic, by themselves existing organisations, they are all 
<BR>
made up of individuals.
<BR>
<P>And have you ever heard about the risks of putting all your eggs in the same 
<BR>
basket?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; You'll be just as innovative as other people tell you to be (its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not for you  to decide, you don't have the means). But being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; innovative isn't really all  transhumanism is about. A nazi can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;play a bit with computers&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism is a much greater stream of ideas that touch all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aspects of  life. Transhumanism has to interest itself in politics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I agree completely. Transhumanism in general, and transhumanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sub-groups in particular, must interest itself in politics. We should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be working to ensure that it is we who have our hands on the levers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of political power, if only to prevent the ignorant and the greedy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from interfering with our achieving our transformative goals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Joseph 1
</EM><BR>
<P>But then again we must understand what our own philosophical basis is. 
<BR>
Otherwise we will propagate ideas that are contrary to our own ideology.
<BR>
<P>Once again, I recommend Virginia Postrel's book &quot;The future and its enemies&quot; 
<BR>
in order not to fall into the trap of arguing for transhumanism with the 
<BR>
ideas of our opponents.
