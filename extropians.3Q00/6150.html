<EM>&gt; &gt; Uh, excuse me, but that attitude is just as bad as that of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; eschatologically minded fundie.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, it's just as &quot;bad&quot; because you define &quot;bad&quot; according to the belief system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; installed in you by the establishment and your own biology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Those &quot;fundies and fanatics&quot; think a lot like you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd ask you for details of your method of insuring world peace and friendly AI,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but apparently that method hasn't worked very well, from what I've heard of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current global events. If there's something worse than lunatic fundies it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably people who can't see the difference between reason and religiosity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Your self-righteous attitude is not appropriate. Thanks anyway.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The question for me has now changed from  why AI would want to be friendly, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *who* it would be friendly toward. As far as I'm concerned, the friendliest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing AI could do would be to let homicidal fanatics do their damnedest, thereby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ridding the world of contentious characters. Justify your moralism or Sayonara

<EM>&gt; Why wouldn't friendly AI leave fundies in the dust?
