<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Personally, while I’d be grateful to the ants for bringing me into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  existence, I doubt that I’d long be willing to enslave myself to them for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the favor. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So you don't get along with your folks either? I personally don't discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything much deeper than the weather with mine. But I don't consider time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent with them slavery.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; The road from human equivalence to Power is not instantaneous. Any initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; post-human AI will be an information-hound. We are full of information. It'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upload us like so many glazed donuts. We will become it. It will be us.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd have to agree.  Most likely, either it would seek others to interact
<BR>
with on its own level (probably easiest path: upgrade the ants that made
<BR>
it), or it would seek to expand its own capacity (probably easiest path:
<BR>
tap into whatever silicon-or-equivalent computer hardware is available,
<BR>
then tap into the biological computing hardware available - of which we
<BR>
are the most advanced, and thus most likely to be tapped first).
