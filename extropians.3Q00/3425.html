<P>At 01:29 PM 20/08/00 +1000, I wrote speculatively:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In case you're wondering, Dotty here is a scientologist, and is quoting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the site's libellous accusations against Mr. Henson, a critic of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cult. This is a feeble attempt to discredit him, and not very effective.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you check out the site, you'll note there is no hard evidence, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;innuendo.
</EM><BR>
<P>=================================
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I suspect these creatures have now found the extropes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, probably ..... but a feeble smear on an E-list doesn't deserve a second
<BR>
thought ....
<BR>
just flaming, not worth the trouble. On the whole Extropians/ Posthumans
<BR>
don't attract much flak
<BR>
whereas pagans have had to put up with lots worse for many years.
<BR>
<P>Here are two separate examples from my postbag TODAY!

<EM>&gt; After a Tuesday night full moon ritual was harassed by protestors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the leader of the Pell City announced the lease of a house and land in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; North Jefferson County.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many people in Warrior say the witches need to stay where they are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;They don't need to come in our community and try to drag other people in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their little think. What every they call it.,&quot; says Warrior resident Larry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mucha.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Warriors police chief says his phone has been ringing off the hook
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since the news of the move got out. All concerned citizens wondering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where the coven was going to locate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some in the community say as long as the witches don't bother them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have the same rights to freedom of religion as anybody else does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;People were raised in the church around here. It's wrong, it's just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basically wrong. There ain't nothing good about it, everything about it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad.&quot; Phillip Niblett

<EM>  &gt; my name is linda lanum, my soulmate is in a Midwestern jail and they
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; told him the being wiccian is a cult and a security risk and that he
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; practice his religion or have anything that is wiccan, Celtic or druid
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sent
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; to him by mail. they have taken everything that i have sent to him that
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; Wiccan. i know that you are a member of miwa, how can i  get someone to
</EM><BR>
<EM>  &gt; help him. or who can i contact as they keep treating worse day by day.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you
<BR>
<EM>  &gt; can contact me at <A HREF="mailto:ww1262@dragonbbs.com?Subject=Re:%20Limits%20of%20tolerance%20/Scientology%20attack?&In-Reply-To=&lt;003f01c00b99$400a69e0$a083bcd4@i6x7m6&gt;">ww1262@dragonbbs.com</A>  .  thank you linda lanum
</EM><BR>
<P>It is worth noting this sort of thing in the eventuality that Extropianism
<BR>
does become big or bothersome enough to worry the vested interests and
<BR>
fundamentalist nutters ..... myself and many others have had to deal with
<BR>
flak for years particularly from the god squad ... and one common theme
<BR>
across all variants post-/trans-humanism (even my own natural magick/
<BR>
post-human/ MVT evolutionary approach) is its strong *anti-supernaturalism
<BR>
*(and de facto anti-Christianity).
