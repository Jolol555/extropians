<EM>&gt; Not everyone. I for example, have not kept health insurance in over ten years,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have not had any health problems that a trip to the local drug store and some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bed rest could not cure. I estimate I have saved over $25,000.00 in insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; premiums in that time. I know that insurance, private or public, is merely a con
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game to get healthy people like me to pay for other people's problems. Now I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be painted as a cruel, cruel, and selfishly mean person for living this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way. Too bad. Its my money.
</EM><BR>
<P>I certainly don't begrudge your choice, and I'm sure I'm one of those
<BR>
who has paid a lot more in premiums than I ever got in benefits--even
<BR>
after the MRI, ENG, and other tests and drugs I got for my Meniere's
<BR>
Disease (maybe about $3-4000).  I do pay cash for dental work.
<BR>
<P>But I would point out that health insurance is not /entirely/ a scam
<BR>
or redistribution system.  As much as Rand would hate to admit it,
<BR>
shit happens.  There really are completely random events that can
<BR>
cost people hundreds of thousands of dollars; even the healthiest,
<BR>
most conscientious people.  Nothing in Kennita's lifestyle, for
<BR>
example, caused her MS--she just happened to be the one.  You or I
<BR>
could be next.  I prefer to think of health insurance as a hedged
<BR>
bet; sure the house percentage is high if you're healthy, and the
<BR>
system as a whole may encourage unhealthful practices, but I still
<BR>
want the hedge, because losing the bet is a killer.
