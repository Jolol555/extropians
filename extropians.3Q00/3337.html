<P>
H. Keith Henson is mentioned in this post. It might be useful for everyone
<BR>
here to note that Mr Henson has been an outspoken critic of Scientology,
<BR>
and subject to harassment at their hands. In a 1998 trial brief
<BR>
<P>IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE
<BR>
<P>KENNETH HODEN,      Plaintiff,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vs.
<BR>
H. KEITH HENSON,      Defendant.
<BR>
Case No. RIC 306884
<BR>
Assigned for all purposes to Hon. Stephen D. Cunnison, Department 7
<BR>
<P>(to be found at <A HREF="http://www.lermanet.com/cos/hensonmotion.htm">http://www.lermanet.com/cos/hensonmotion.htm</A> )
<BR>
<P>we read in the TRIAL BRIEF OF DEFENDANT that
<BR>
<P>&lt; The gist of plaintiff's fallacious case is that defendant is a large,
<BR>
drug-crazed, dangerous man with a history of violent, criminal and
<BR>
murderous activity within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure ß
<BR>
527.6(b).  Declaration of Kenneth Hoden, 3, 4 and 5, Declaration of
<BR>
Kendrick L. Moxon, Exh., 1-15.  However, nothing could be further from the
<BR>
truth as Exhibit A hereto evidences.  Mr. Henson had never been arrested
<BR>
for any alleged Offense until he was targeted by Scientology's ferocious
<BR>
litigation juggernaut.  The Church of Scientology, through its office of
<BR>
Special Affairs (&quot;OSA&quot;) has a long and documented history of abusing the
<BR>
judicial system with vexatious and frivolous litigation for the purpose of
<BR>
harassing and destroying its critics, even framing them.  This, and the
<BR>
related cases, are merely further examples of this sordid anti- social
<BR>
history. &gt;
<BR>
<P>Curious, isn't it?
<BR>
<P>(I don't know what has transpired since that case.)
