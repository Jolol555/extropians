<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Here's a thought: &quot;Why is it that in Chicago handgun crime is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;fairly common despite the fact that they banned handguns over 18
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;years ago, yet the surrounding suburbs where handguns are legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;have almost no handgun crime?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Gee I don't know.  Could it be that Chicago has a fairly large
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;population of less-than-gainfully-employed, poorly educated,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drug-abusing people with less than ideal family backgrounds, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the same is typically true to a significantly lesser extent in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'burbs?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sarcasm aside, you are basically correct. The people involved in
<BR>
gun crime don't follow laws, so anti-gun laws are 100% ineffective.
<BR>
Illinois has licensing, instacheck, waiting periods, and in
<BR>
addition Chicago has a 19 year ban on handguns.... completely
<BR>
ineffective.
<BR>
<P>Give me a map of Chicago and I could outline some areas in red,
<BR>
others in yellow. As long as you never ventured into these areas
<BR>
you would never see a gun or hear a gun shot.
