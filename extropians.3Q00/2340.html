He said 75%. First day figures showed that 78% paid. The decrease indicates that
<BR>
a number of people figured since that 78% was over his 75% minimum, they could
<BR>
morally download for free. I think what you'll find is book sales like this to
<BR>
run on a 'telethon'-like basis, where you'll have agressive advocates haranguing
<BR>
the masses of deadbeats to pay up whenever the percentage drops below 75%. THis
<BR>
is also indirectly similar to how the Nielsen Ratings System allows the public
<BR>
to vote on what TV shows they want the networks to make. I imagine that TV show
<BR>
producers in the future might hold telethons for the production of their TV
<BR>
shows to reach a certain point before they will be broadcast on the web, etc.

<EM>&gt; &gt; More than 76% of the people who downloaded Stephen King's &quot;The Plant Part I&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; actually paid for it.  He made no effort to enforce the payment of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; book - he just promised he'd keep writing installments as long as enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people paid for it.  Well, apparently they have.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I predict that the percentage who pay will drop as the novelty wears off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Has King said what the threshold is below which he won't continue?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My guess is that the percentage who pay will approach that level.
