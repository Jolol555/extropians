<P><EM> &gt; You are leaving out the costs of simulating a rich enough environment
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; for those evolving virtual beasties to rub up against and be tested by. 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Millions or billions of times faster is still not infinite.  It still
</EM><BR>
<P>I think a factor of million is realistic for a massively parallel
<BR>
molecular circuit machine [1 ms:1 ns], but not one billion [1 ms: 1
<BR>
ps], that's a bit too fast. (1 ms is here chosen somewhat arbitrarily
<BR>
as a neuronal chronon, it is a time step size frequently used in
<BR>
neuronal emulation models).
<BR>
<P>You could probably switch ~100 GHz with NEMS, but not sustainably, if
<BR>
volume integrated, unless you can pull Drexler's fractal cooling
<BR>
channel trick. Everything else would require electronically excited
<BR>
molecular states, and here you have to stay away from
<BR>
photodissociation, and probably even photon emission.
<BR>
<P>Volume integrated NEMS is distinctly Singularity-tech (imho
<BR>
incompatible with flesh people still walking down the street) and
<BR>
hence not something which concerns me very much, and crystals of
<BR>
autoassembled molecular circuits are rather delicate. You can't pump
<BR>
them too high, they'd denaturate.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; takes a lot of resources to get a real complex alife evolution
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; happening.
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, and Unreal-type 3d games are about the fastest reality
<BR>
simulators we have. If these things had hooks for success feedback and
<BR>
a reality model more complex than run-pick-up-point-shoot, one could
<BR>
certainly start training critters to solve tasks more complex than a
<BR>
record walk-through while fragging everybody's ass off.
