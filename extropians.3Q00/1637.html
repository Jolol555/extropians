<EM>&gt; Michael S. Lorrey&quot; added his attack to the prior attack I grumbled about:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I've been on the list for years, and I've NEVER heard of any such thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Either you made it up or you deliberately misunderstood someones
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recommendation that you just listen for a while to get into the flow of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's the July 10th message I was referring to.  Are you saying it's not an attack?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Well, hello troll, I haven't seen you around here before... do you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything substantive to say, or are you just a hit &amp; run luddite?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to my files, I had posted twice prior to the attack so I really do feel like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the author was trying to Catch-22 me (&quot;don't post here until you've been seen posting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a while&quot;).  I don't know if he is the moderator or not.
</EM><BR>
<P>And how long have you been subscribed to the list? And were you aware of the
<BR>
decidedly anti-luddite bent of the list beforehand? If you were aware of this,
<BR>
your choice to subscribe and post luddite posts does in fact indicate that your
<BR>
only purpose was to be a troll.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There is no *impossible*, only difficult, expensive, or time consuming.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Obviously, we have different opinions. Not everything can be stuffed back in Pandora's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Box.  BTW, I'm here at ground-zero (i.e, farming the soil).  How many miles back are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you?
</EM><BR>
<P>I've farmed the soil, fished the rivers, ponds and streams, and hunted in the
<BR>
wilderness since I could ride a bike. Nature is the most resilient force there
<BR>
is, but it does things in its own sweet time, NOT on YOUR schedule.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interesting that you would bring that up.  Really good farmers, as opposed to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;spread bagged stuff and poison the sh*t out of anything that moves&quot; variety knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beforehand that Mt. St. Helens would go a long way toward remineralizing thousands of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; square miles of needy land.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yet if the force of that explosion had been man made rather than natural, I
<BR>
doubt very much that you would be singing the same tune. You'd likely be suing
<BR>
whoever did it (and the government as well for allowing it), and make up some
<BR>
more pseudo-science to 'quantify' your losses...You'd be bitching and whining
<BR>
about 'fallout', and increased incidence of respiratory illness, etc. while
<BR>
hiding all the monster sized veggies you can now grow thanks to all those new
<BR>
minerals...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The anti-GMO side is ignorant to the extreme (hell, they can't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It that a name?
</EM><BR>
<P>Merely a descriptive, and an accurate one at that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pronounce 'nuclear' right), their whole argument is based on ignorance,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is that another name---or two?
</EM><BR>
<P>more mere accurate descriptive based on real experience. Never met a greenie
<BR>
that could pronounce nuclear right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and a willful ignorance at that. Their science is pseudo-science of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is that two more?
</EM><BR>
<P>More accurate descriptives.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worst sort, that any real scientist would laugh at as the product of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sixth grade student, with logical errors abounding and much unaccounted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for evidence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Two more---what is the name count up to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I generally fire up the killfile when the name-calling count hits ten.  Besides, I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only trying to offer another opinion and don't always have time for battles.
</EM><BR>
<P>Coming on a known anti-luddite list and spouting pure luddite and tree hugger
<BR>
propaganda is one sure way to get a a battle. Apparently you don't have time for
<BR>
battles when you are apparently losing them.
