<P>
<EM>&gt; The naked, unsupported assertion that music sales will not support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artists absent copyright won't become true no matter how many times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you repeat it.  If this were true, broadcast television and radio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would not exist at all, and yet they are billion dollar industries.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not surprized that I seem to be the only one in this debate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who is using actual examples and actual numbers.  Continually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; repeating unbacked opinions is a poor substitute for real philosophy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Proceeding from false assumptions is also a poor substitute for real
<BR>
philosophy.
<BR>
<P>Here you make the claim that TV and radio would not exist at all if there
<BR>
were truly no market in the absence of copyright.  But TV thrives on
<BR>
copyright-- otherwise they wouldn't have all those major issues with
<BR>
icravetv.com
<BR>
<P>Don't you think FOX would love to be able to start playing Seinfeld and
<BR>
Frasier??  Hey, they wouldn't need to make any original programs at all
<BR>
anymore, just siphon off the best from the other networks!  For that matter,
<BR>
*I* could start broadcasting Seinfeld and Frasier-- gee whiz, think of all
<BR>
the advertising revenue I could make!
<BR>
<P>If the broadcasters don't own their content anymore, then there's no
<BR>
incentive for them to create it.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am a 100% free-market capitalist.  I hold no higher moral value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than earning profit in the free market.  But &quot;free market&quot; is open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to varying definitions.  Yours (and that of the existing system)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; includes the idea of government-backed protection of the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in information-based goods and services.
</EM><BR>
<P>...and government backed protection of the market in commodities... and
<BR>
rollerblades and cell phones and knee high socks and perky toy poodles.
<BR>
<P>Why arbitrarily pick out information as the lone property from which to
<BR>
remove this sort of protection?
<BR>
<P>Re-selling information works is neither force nor fraud;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it is only &quot;theft&quot; because the law defines it as such, and it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that definition we are debating, so you can't make it a premise.
</EM><BR>
<P>Breaking into your house is only &quot;theft&quot; because the law defines it as such.
<BR>
You don't object to the act of stealing, you just object to the means?  And
<BR>
if the means are non-intrusive enough, you have no objection?  Sounds like
<BR>
the argument from liquidity again... it's &quot;easy&quot; to steal, so it's okay...
