<P>
<EM>&gt; I think a little meditation on this question -- abandoning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preconceptions for some honest, intense thought in search of an answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- might change your thinking.  Your argument is not supported by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; historical evidence; therefore there must be an error in your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumptions or your logic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is Shakespeare really relevant to a discussion regarding the digital
<BR>
propagation of information over a massively accessible network?  Hey, you
<BR>
might be right, theatrical performance -will- probably be safe for some time
<BR>
yet... there's still time to see Cats.
<BR>
<P>I would say that the preconceptions run deep on both sides of this
<BR>
ebate.  -Your- arguments are not supported by 'historical evidence,' there's
<BR>
plenty of evidence that a high demand environment with protected properties
<BR>
creates a lot of innovation and profit for lots of people.  You can't argue
<BR>
that the current system hasn't been successful... it's taken us this far and
<BR>
it's unlikely we'd be here today if the starting conditions were different.
<BR>
(Unless you're going to argue that the massive explosion of entertainment,
<BR>
intellectual and scientific properties that has occurred over the last few
<BR>
decades would have been *faster* if only those damn scientists and software
<BR>
engineers and movie producers had given everything away for free??)
<BR>
&nbsp;The -real- issue is that the arena is changing in a fundamental way--
<BR>
is -now- the time to start to eliminate the concept of ownership?
<BR>
<P>The current model is an intensely competitive one.  Lots of people have real
<BR>
positive attitudes about a world in which everything is free and we have no
<BR>
concepts of ownership.  I'll quote from Alex's recent post:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Chances are that neither of us bothers to keep
<BR>
track anymore-- physical scarcity is a thing of the past, and the
<BR>
competition that exists between individuals is at subtler social and
<BR>
intellectual levels.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This sounds nice.  Utopian almost.
<BR>
<P>Am I a cynic to believe that 'subtle social and intellectual competition
<BR>
ain't gonna hack it for the majority of the human race just yet?
<BR>
<P>I agree that when money is useless, we can re-write the rules.  When we live
<BR>
in a complete attention economy, it will be enough to merely be credited as
<BR>
the creator of information.  But what happens when people start arguing that
<BR>
information should be free from that also?
<BR>
<P><P>In my mind, there is only one issue.  We need to create positive feedback
<BR>
loops for behavior that we'd like to encourage.  We've got good evidence
<BR>
regarding the feedback mechanisms that seem to be working so far.  The
<BR>
growth of intellectual property is currently geometric.  Lots of people are
<BR>
highly motivated to produce intellectual property under the current model.
<BR>
It's like the great wild frontier and everyone is motivated to get out there
<BR>
and stake a claim.
<BR>
<P>You know why I'm not concerned about people owning intellectual property?
<BR>
It's limitless.  It's a gold rush with no end.  There's always going to be
<BR>
more ideas, more things, more ways to take advantage of ideas.  Claiming
<BR>
ideas doesn't slow growth, it motivates others to quickly build their *own.*
<BR>
There's so many advantages to coming up with ideas these days that
<BR>
everyone's motivated to do it.  I want to continue to see direct rewards
<BR>
accruing to those individuals who come up with the best ones.  I don't want
<BR>
them to make their money by advertising, or hand-outs, or public
<BR>
appearances, or selling t-shirts or any of the other flimsy (IMO) means
<BR>
described in this discussion thus far.  I want them to make their money as a
<BR>
direct result of meeting direct demand in the marketplace.
