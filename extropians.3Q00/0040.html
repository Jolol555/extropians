<P>It depends entirely what you mean by eugenics. In a way, one could argues
<BR>
that in choosing partners with whom to have children, we are engaging in
<BR>
eugenics. There is nothing wrong with that, obviously.
<BR>
<P>I'd say that there is nothing whatever wrong with doing everyone one
<BR>
possibly can to ensure that one's offspring is healthy and will live longer
<BR>
and so on and so forth (and yes, sure, when it becomes possible in
<BR>
practice, why not include beautiful and potentially intelligent too?).
<BR>
<P>The thing that is very very wrong is not those things, not the eugenic
<BR>
choices made by individuals striving to give their offspring the best
<BR>
possible start, as it were. Nor is it the work done by researchers and
<BR>
companies creating the knowledge which those individuals may want, in order
<BR>
to do this.
<BR>
<P>The problem is with state eugenics programs, using state coercion to impose
<BR>
the state's eugenic theories on everyone else. The reason that is a
<BR>
problem, apart from the immorality of treating human beings as means to the
<BR>
state's ends instead of ends in themselves, is that imposing one theory on
<BR>
everyone is highly likely to lead to error. Imposing a theory on others is
<BR>
inimical to the growth of knowledge. While it may be that the state has
<BR>
good intentions and is aiming to improve the human race, *imposing* its
<BR>
theory is not the answer. It should allow the different theories to compete.
<BR>
<P>When we are all acting upon our own best eugenic theories -- whether that
<BR>
means just choosing a father for one's children based on the man's height,
<BR>
physical attractiveness, and success in the workplace, say, or OTOH making
<BR>
use of whatever research is available to produce (what you hope will be) a
<BR>
genetically improved child -- there is much less likely to be a systematic
<BR>
error introduced. When different individuals' theories are allowed to
<BR>
compete, as it were, our knowledge of how to improve things is much more
<BR>
likely to improve. If you let individuals decide whether to make use of the
<BR>
available information or not, any actual improvements there are will speak
<BR>
for themselves and presumably, if that is indeed a good thing, people will
<BR>
choose it for themselves without having to be forced into it.
<BR>
<P>But when the government decides to impose its eugenic theories on us, how,
<BR>
apart from disobeying the law, can other theories be tested? So the current
<BR>
moves to ban genetic research seem to me gravely mistaken. The Nazis and
<BR>
others were not using the same *method* of imposing their theory, to be
<BR>
sure, but it is the same kind of thing -- in both the Nazi case and the
<BR>
current or potential ban on genetic research, what is happening is that the
<BR>
state is imposing its own eugenic theories on the people.
<BR>
<P>The problem is almost the opposite of what people calling for a ban on
<BR>
genetic research think it is.
