<P>Be my guest Spike. I feel like Kermit the frog. I always felt sorry for him, 
<BR>
he really tried to put on a professional show, but everything around him 
<BR>
went down in anarchy, since the other muppets didn't get his point. 
<BR>
Unfortunately, the misadventures of Kermit seems to have similarities with 
<BR>
my own experience in transhumanism.
<BR>
<P>We are still a movement that hides in the basement, we' re not getting out 
<BR>
in the public forums, after so much time. Actually the trend does seem to me 
<BR>
to go backwards. Rereading old issues of Extropy magazine was interesting, 
<BR>
but frightening, the discourse was on a higher, more informed, level.
<BR>
<P>In my last days in the Swedish Transhumanist Association I often found 
<BR>
myself writing e-mail about 30 or 40K long explaining basically &quot;Economics 
<BR>
101&quot; to others, constantly trying to re- invent the wheel to keep the 
<BR>
discourse on at least a serious level. You know, Spike, 
<BR>
transhumanism/extropianism is a very, very difficult ideology. It has to 
<BR>
keep such a high, and complex level of reasoning, and cannot function if it 
<BR>
degrades itself into just buying into popular assumptions (that are often 
<BR>
very far from the cutting edge of their respective fields or basically 
<BR>
wrong). But explaining that, for instance, the feodal system of Europe in 
<BR>
the Middle Ages was a very complex system of obligations and counter- 
<BR>
obligations, and not really the type of &quot;serfdom&quot; that has found popular 
<BR>
acceptance (which is instead slavery) would take one of those 30K mails- 
<BR>
bringing the debate up to date with present research findings. You might 
<BR>
ask, wouldn´t that be good? Well, the problem is that a discourse, to 
<BR>
develop (particularly such a new and radical discourse as 
<BR>
transhumanism/extropianism) has to move beyond the basic level, relying on 
<BR>
the participants to inform themselves.
<BR>
<P>My experience says that one of the problems are that the transhumanist 
<BR>
movement established itself, from the beginning, as an activist movement. 
<BR>
Activism is important, but it is a later stage in the development of a 
<BR>
political movement. Looking on how other movements established themselves 
<BR>
one can see that they didn't establish themselves as activist movements. The 
<BR>
activist stage came when a potent intellectual movement had been 
<BR>
established, when it had developed it own &quot;Great Narrative&quot; of history, 
<BR>
enabling the members of the activist movement to undergo a metamorphosis to 
<BR>
becoming a member of a distinct transhumanist culture, not relying on other 
<BR>
cultures.
<BR>
<P>The problem with establishing an activist movement first is of course that 
<BR>
even if some (or even quite a lot) of the basic philosophical ideas of the 
<BR>
ideology has been constructed they will have problems to be established even 
<BR>
among the members. The members of the activist movement aren't experts in 
<BR>
every field or even intellectuals (used in the sense that they lead the 
<BR>
public discourse, can communicate on a wide area of subjects and keep ahead 
<BR>
on these at least in regards to their audience). So they have to rely on 
<BR>
what they often absorb eclectically from their culture. And that's a 
<BR>
problem, since the culture they absorb these ideas from isn´t a 
<BR>
transhumanist one (at times I seriously question if the present Western 
<BR>
culture is even humanist, read for instance popular thinkers as Georg Henrik 
<BR>
von Wright and Zygmunt Bauman). The practically and morality of 
<BR>
transhumanism are always questioned, and this introduces dangerous elements 
<BR>
in the thoughts of the members of the activist movement.
<BR>
<P>I call these elements by their marxist terms: right- wing opportunism, left- 
<BR>
wing sectarianism, and salon- transhumanism (compared to the leninist term). 
<BR>
Briefly: right- wing opportunism constantly challenges transhumanisms 
<BR>
practicality by analysing it through the intellectual tools of other 
<BR>
ideological movements, not understanding the fact that analytical tools (and 
<BR>
even language) are heavily tainted by ideology, this since no specific 
<BR>
transhumanist tools of analysis or &quot;Great Narrative&quot; has been developed. 
<BR>
This leads to compromising one's ideals specifically with regards to the 
<BR>
opponent's.
<BR>
Left- wing sectarianism calls for &quot;singularity today&quot;, everything else is 
<BR>
treason- not really understanding the way of how social change is done or 
<BR>
how ideological hegemony is achieved- in the end compromising the 
<BR>
practicality of the ideology. Salon- transhumanism might buy into the idea 
<BR>
of the practicality of transhumanism, but uses other sets of morals to value 
<BR>
that practicality, and since these do not condone transhumanism the 
<BR>
&quot;practical&quot; is always in conflict with the &quot;moral&quot; since they have not 
<BR>
adopted a transhumanist morality.
<BR>
In the end these elements will break a movement from the inside (as they did 
<BR>
with marxism, eventhough they identified these elements). The antidote 
<BR>
against this, Spike, is ideological consciousness- an integration of 
<BR>
transhumanist analysis tools (to form the practical foundations) with a 
<BR>
transhumanist morality (to form the moral foundation). This cannot be done 
<BR>
in an isolated activist movement. It breeds a &quot;bring your own&quot;- attitude 
<BR>
which brings it in constant conflict with the basic assumptions of the 
<BR>
movement (not being able to see what they lead to) and no intellectual 
<BR>
support from the attacks of a very non- sympathetic cultural climate. And 
<BR>
the member does not complete the metamorphosis into becoming a 
<BR>
transhumanist.
<BR>
<P>Mind you, our opponents have the things we lack, and that is why THEIR 
<BR>
activism has success. It has the intellectual support, it goes down deep 
<BR>
into the ideological climate that presently has achieved an intellectual 
<BR>
hegemony in Western culture, and the metamorphosis of the member is very 
<BR>
easy.
<BR>
<P>I have compared sometimes how corporations and &quot;mass movements&quot; obtain their 
<BR>
members. Corporations choose their members (as you probably have seen if you 
<BR>
ever have attended to a job interview), in &quot;mass movements&quot; everyone is 
<BR>
accepted. This makes the corporation able to construct a tribe (the K.A. 
<BR>
Nordström term), a common cultural identity, much easier.
<BR>
The &quot;mass movement&quot; then? Well, the type of &quot;mass movement&quot; we see in the 
<BR>
West today was pioneered mainly by the German social- democratic party in 
<BR>
the 19th century, but by the time it established itself it had already 
<BR>
achieved ideological supremacy. It spoke to the gatekeepers of information, 
<BR>
the intellectuals, while the conservative and liberal (in a European sense, 
<BR>
thus a classical liberalism then) tried to speak with individuals, 
<BR>
neglecting the enormous power of the intellectual, especially in a mass 
<BR>
society (which is unfortunately still present today) thus getting in members 
<BR>
that leaned more and more towards socialist views, which had gained 
<BR>
intellectual hegemony, thus even more crippling them in the public arena. 
<BR>
They said the same things as their opponents becoming only &quot;non- socialists&quot; 
<BR>
(much is to learn form the success of socialism in the 20th century, 
<BR>
eventhough the public view of that success is fundamentally flawed- thinking 
<BR>
it a result of mass movements). Thus it was very easy to build a tribe then 
<BR>
for the SDP,  transmitting an identity is easy when that identity is the 
<BR>
default.
<BR>
<P>Of course, living in a mass society, also means that the individuals have 
<BR>
distinct problems with the very complex task of building a movement (or 
<BR>
association) instead relying on corporativism (again I am using the European 
<BR>
term here, I don't know what term is accepted in the US). The transhumanist 
<BR>
activist isn't present in today's society. No transhumanists will walk in 
<BR>
from the streets. The transhumanist activist must be constructed. This is an 
<BR>
ardous task for the intellectuals of the movement (but as history, and our 
<BR>
opponents show, it can be done)- but then transhumanism must be a vibrant 
<BR>
challenge to the intellectuals, daring to be utopian but also presenting 
<BR>
them with a &quot;Great Narrative&quot; to achieve that Utopia. Today I, 
<BR>
unfortunately, don't see that- the internal intellectual production is weak 
<BR>
(I STILL think that Anders Sandberg' s website is one of the greatest 
<BR>
intellectual achievments of transhumanism, but it is soooooooooooooooo damn 
<BR>
old). But being locked down in &quot;Economics 101&quot;, makes the intellectuals 
<BR>
unable to rejuvenate the discourse or to take on new frontiers. This, and 
<BR>
the fact that the opponent's intellectuals can do this isolates the 
<BR>
transhumanist intellectual to &quot;preaching to their own&quot; (as noted by Greg 
<BR>
Burch in his recent mail) and thus instilling doubts in the intellectuals.
<BR>
<P>A change of strategy is at hand, I think.
<BR>
Like our opponents say, this is World War IV. And if we don't understand 
<BR>
this and form ourselves into a better fighting force they will win, 
<BR>
unopposed.
<BR>
<P><P>Sincerely,
<BR>
