<P><EM>&gt;    The per-capita wealth of highly-copied uploads might decline, but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    would not be a bad thing from their point of view. Their choice would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    indicate that they prefer many poorer copies to a single richer copy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    just as parents today prefer the expense of children to the rich life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of leisure possible without them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not sure you can conclude that highly-copied uploads favor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the outcome to which their choices have led them.  It seems to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are externalities in each upload's decision to reproduce itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which can negatively effect the other uploads by driving wages down.
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a large literature on the economics of population that I am drawing
<BR>
from.  An accessible summary of it is in Steven Landsburg's &quot;Fair Play&quot;
<BR>
(or was it &quot;Armchair Economist&quot;?).   I can be confident here because
<BR>
I'm just drawing on that literature - the applications to uploads is trivial.
<BR>
<P>In general making a better product hurts your competitors, but in a competitive
<BR>
market there is no
<BR>
net externality (this is usually called a &quot;pecuinary externality&quot;), and doing
<BR>
this is a net benefit.  Creating more children might create more labor
<BR>
competition for others, but it is also a net benefit.  The main way that people
<BR>
try to argue against having more children is to invoke ethical rules such as our
<BR>
goal is to maximize the per-capita wealth, regardless of how few people that
<BR>
leads us to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What happens to this scenario if the welfare of uploads is weighted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equally with that of non-uploads, and the political system includes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploads in the redistribution of wealth?  Does the ease of copying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still make everyone rich?
</EM><BR>
<P>There exists a redistribution such that every creature, upload or not, is better
<BR>
off by allowing uploads.
