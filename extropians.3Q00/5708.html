&lt;n=1,436&gt;, and 1992 &lt;n=1,340&gt;. For each survey year the prevalence rates of any

violence and severe violence were significantly higher for female to male than
<BR>
for male to female. For example, in 1983 the rate of any violence male to

female
<BR>
was 36.7, while the rate of any violence female to male was 48; in 1986, the
<BR>
rate of severe violence male to female was 9.5, while the rate of severe

violence female to male was 22.8. In 1992, the rate of any violence male to

female was 20.2, with a severe violence rate male to female of 5.7; while the

rate of any violence female to male was 27.9, with a severe violence rate

female
<BR>
to male of 13.8. Author notes that the decline in violence over time is

attributed to the increase in age of the subjects. Results reveal &lt;p. 163&gt; that

over twice as many women as men reported assaulting a partner who had not

assaulted them during the study year.&quot; In 1986 about 20% of both men and women

more likely to self report personal injuries.)
