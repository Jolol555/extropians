<EM>&gt; &gt; As for books in general, they're neat, but I don't fetishize them.  It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their information I enjoy, not the physical act of handling or smelling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them.  (Not that I'm some kind of antisensualist.  I definitely like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; physical acts of other sorts.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In general I probably pay somewhat less than average attention to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintenance and grooming of the physical objects in my life-- with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glaring exception of my books.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've read many of the books in my collection without breaking their
</EM><BR>
spine--
<BR>
<EM>&gt; indeed, without fully opening them.  (The softcovers primarily...)
</EM><BR>
<P>I take care of my books, too, but that's only because I want them to last.
<BR>
I often refer to them, especially the nonfiction ones on mathematics,
<BR>
physics, biology, philosophy, and history.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Accordingly, despite the fact that I don't appear to have the 'packrat'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gene, my books seem to be the one thing with which I am unable to part.
</EM><BR>
<P>I used to be the same way, until I got tired of lugging them around.  Once I
<BR>
moved in with roommates -- after college, that is -- I couldn't just put my
<BR>
books anywhere like I did before.  (When I was in college, it didn't matter
<BR>
because my roommate didn't hassle me about it.  Also, he didn't see my books
<BR>
as community property.  Not so when I moved in with R &amp; V after college.:)
<BR>
<P>I started to ask myself if I really needed to keep every last paperback I
<BR>
read, including the ones I knew I'd never read again and ones I downright
<BR>
did not like.  Those were the first to go.  But my collection has grown
<BR>
anyway.  Just today, I bought four books and a journal...:/  (And three of
<BR>
these are mathematics books, which I will read and keep for reference.  The
<BR>
journal I'll probably keep too.  So, there's a net gain of four out of
<BR>
five.)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
