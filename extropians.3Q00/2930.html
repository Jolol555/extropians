<EM>&gt; Well, it would be possible to use nanoscopes to see structural defects at
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; level finer than currently.  That, way, all the processes could be tuned
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt; comprehensive fitness.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly!  Of course, in some cases, one might not be able to do more than
<BR>
just see the defects.  But if it's something where a process produces
<BR>
variable outputs -- as with manufactureing microchips -- it might be a case
<BR>
of seeing the defects and rejecting the outputs that fall below a certain
<BR>
threshold.  With nanoscale detection * one would certainly be able to do
<BR>
this.  This would be especially important in critical components or
<BR>
components that fail at a high rate because of their structure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In terms of nanotech replication machines it could probably reproduce
</EM><BR>
nanotechs
<BR>
<EM>&gt; at a pretty fast rate.  That means very high quality crystals until it is
</EM><BR>
used
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for plastics and other polymers.
</EM><BR>
<P>To be precise here, I'm not talking about nanoassemblers -- nanotech that
<BR>
reproduces -- but about non-nanotech that produces nanotech.  To some
<BR>
extent, we have this now.  People are already building nanoscale structures.
<BR>
Since we don't yet have true nanoassemblers, we can still, I believe build a
<BR>
lot of useful nanostructures and even devices with current technology.
<BR>
<P>The real trick is being able to produce such things in such a way as to make
<BR>
a profit and, hopefully, further progress along.  (I think if nanotech
<BR>
structures make it out of the lab now, it will signal investors to put more
<BR>
funding into the work as well as bring the stuff into everyday life.)

<P>*  I prefer this over &quot;nanoscope,&quot; as that term implies something akin to a
<BR>
microscope albeit smaller.  In fact, nanoscale detection might be something
<BR>
as simple and crude as making the defective item or process change color
<BR>
change so that we can detect the problem output at a macroscale.  E.g., if
<BR>
defective microchips changed to dayglow green, we be able to pick them out
<BR>
of the batch.  Crude but effective, no?
