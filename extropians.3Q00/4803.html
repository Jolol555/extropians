<EM>&gt; Okay, I've been wracking my brain for three days and I still can't figure this

<EM>&gt; out.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; What exactly IS the relevance of the gun discussion to Extropianism?
</EM><BR>
<P>This was a bit of thread drift off of a discussion about which presidential
<BR>
candidate is a more extropic choice. I think most people on the list will agree
<BR>
that individual liberty is a very extropic thing. Brian, James, Daniel, myself,
<BR>
and others are apparently of the opinion that individual liberty will only exist
<BR>
so long as the individual can defend themselves and their individual liberty
<BR>
against the agressions of other individuals, groups, and governments, and given
<BR>
the hostility with which candidates like Nader and Gore have toward both
<BR>
individual liberty and the individuals ability to defend that individual
<BR>
liberty, I think that we pretty much agree that neither of these candidates is
<BR>
particularly extropic. Bush many not be much better, but he's more of the
<BR>
'lesser evil' type candidate, because he is for preserving our individual
<BR>
ability to defend our liberty, even though he may not be for every individual
<BR>
liberty we support. While someone like Harry Browne comes closer than most every
<BR>
other candidate to most extropian values, his practical ability to win the
<BR>
election is about as good as a blind quadrapelegics chance of hitting a bull's
<BR>
butt with a bass fiddle, and Gore actually has a decent risk of winning this
<BR>
election despite himself. In this case its rather obvious what a 'rational'
<BR>
choice to make is for an extropian: put Bush in the white house.
<BR>
<P>Granted the further discussion is of minimal importance to most of the list. I
<BR>
do suggest that if people want to continue it, that they do so at my exi-freedom
<BR>
list on egroups, which is there for the expressed purpose of discussion of
<BR>
topics that the more militant 'hear no evil' members do not want to discuss.
