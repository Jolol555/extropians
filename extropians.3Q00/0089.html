<EM>&gt; &gt;That's fine if you believe that [compulsory taxation in support of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commonweal]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- but what if you didn't believe it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if you don't believe in immunisation or fluoridation, or reading and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing, for your own children? This is obviously a highly vexed question,
</EM><BR>
<P>blah blah blah digressing away from the direct question. What you can do
<BR>
if you want is continue the idea of letting the &quot;social services&quot; or
<BR>
whatever they call it down under take away the kids from the parents if
<BR>
there is &quot;abuse.&quot; So let the family unsubscribe from all the government
<BR>
schemes, but if they get poor and can't keep their private insurance
<BR>
going or whatever then they either go back on the public system or lose
<BR>
the kids.
<BR>
<P>Why does it always come down to the kids in these types of freedom issues?
<BR>
Let's consider strictly adults if that makes it easier.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and I suppose most people here would fight to the death to allow a fellow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizen to keep her child as susceptible to disease and caries as possible,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though possible not illiterate. I don't even know what my own opinion is -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect some kind of implicit `social contract' theory might kick in, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which, naturally, communal reinterpretation of the terms of the contract
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be an on-going process. Humans are critters selected to live in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *groups*, however individualistic we might be. The very language we use to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debate such issues is a collective construct, not an idiographic one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (however much playful wordsters like me might deform it).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;should you be forced to contribute to that system? Why not have an option
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to not contribute and also be denied access to it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In Oz, people who choose to send their kids to church or other private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; schools get a chunk of their tax money back in grants to those schools. Is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it equal to the amount they pay? I don't know - possibly in toto it is,
</EM><BR>
<P>That's nice if it is equal, but do I also get a dividend based on what I
<BR>
could have earned on that money in the time between taxation and &quot;giveback&quot;
<BR>
by investing it? Why does the government still have to get its paws on it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; since it's mostly Catholics who support private church schools and they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tend not to be the wealthy in Australia. On the other hand, the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory of the thing is that those who get side benefits of the system (all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of us; the childless as well as the fecund, etc) also have to pay, just as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; law-abiding citizens shell out for the incarceration of criminals; it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; presumably deemed a happier outcome than letting them run loose.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok so this is the all or nothing argument. Let's stay on topic here, and
<BR>
talk strictly about the health care, not about prisons or whatever. You
<BR>
are arguing that because of &quot;side benefits&quot; I should not be able to with-
<BR>
draw from the system. This is like saying that because of some side
<BR>
benefits of a religion (such as altruistic acts) I should be forced to
<BR>
worship it? I just don't understand the logic here. That's great if you
<BR>
have created some system that has some side benefits for me, but don't
<BR>
force me to participate. That is like giving someone a gift, and then
<BR>
expecting something in return.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; None of this is meant to suggest that there isn't `a Better Way'. But it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does argue that this way of thinking about governance isn't `idiotic' or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil, or any other similar epithet likely to be heard in this forum.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm just trying to get it straight in my mind why such a system is a good
<BR>
thing. Perhaps I'm wrong and we need a system like that in the USA. I am
<BR>
just fact finding at the moment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It's like the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;has chosen a religion for you, and you have no choice but to worship it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I had the strong impression that in the States sanctimonious Xianity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approaches that condition. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>That's below the belt :-)
