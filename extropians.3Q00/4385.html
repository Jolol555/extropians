<P>N is for Nietzsche (and Nazis, Neuroses, Nihilism and the Nature of the
<BR>
universe) 
<BR>
<P>To mark the 100th anniversary of his death, we present the A-Z of the
<BR>
philosopher who became one of the most reviled figures of the 20th century.
<BR>
Could it be that he was just a little misunderstood? 
<BR>
<P>By Kevin Jackson 
<BR>
<P>25 August 2000 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;A is for Antichrist 
<BR>
<P>Born in 1844 to a Lutheran clergyman, Friedrich Nietzsche tore himself away
<BR>
from his pious roots to become a startlingly vehement and searching enemy
<BR>
of Christian civilization. One of his last completed works, bluntly
<BR>
entitled The Anti-Christ, declares that &quot;The Christian Church has left
<BR>
nothing untouched by its depravity...&quot; And who or what, in the Nietzschean
<BR>
view, was the Antichrist himself? The answer can be found in his short
<BR>
autobiography Ecce Homo (III, 2): &quot;Ich bin... der Antichrist.&quot; Eat your
<BR>
heart out, Johnny Rotten. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
B is for Beyond Good and Evil 
<BR>
<P>&quot;That which is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil&quot;:
<BR>
one of the more pregnant sayings from Nietzsche's last book of aphorisms,
<BR>
and a maxim which goes some way towards suggesting what its provocative
<BR>
title, Beyond Good and Evil (1886), might fully signify. 
<BR>
<P>C is for Classics 
<BR>
<P>At the age of 24, Nietzsche was appointed to the chair of classical
<BR>
philology at Basel University, and he remained a professor for the next 10
<BR>
years. His very first publication, in 1867, was a textual essay on
<BR>
Theognis. It was an inauspiciously dry overture to such an iconoclastic
<BR>
career, and yet one of the foundations for all Nietzsche's later thought
<BR>
was his reinterpretation of the Greek culture of the sixth century BC: he
<BR>
was especially keen on the so-called Pre-Socratic philosophers, Heraclitus,
<BR>
Thales and Empedocles. Note, too, his lifelong fascination for: 
<BR>
<P>D is for Dionysus 
<BR>
<P>The Greek deity who meant many things to Nietzsche at different times of
<BR>
his life. In The Birth of Tragedy, his first major publication (much
<BR>
derided by his academic colleagues, who thought it at best fanciful, at
<BR>
worst nutty), the emotional Dionysian force is opposed to the Apollonian
<BR>
form-creating principle; in his middle years, &quot;Dionysus&quot; stands for the
<BR>
sublimated &quot;Will to Power&quot; and becomes synonymous with the Übermensch; and
<BR>
with the onset of his madness, he begins to sign his ranting letters
<BR>
&quot;Dionysus&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>E is for Eternal Recurrence 
<BR>
<P>The mystical doctrine preached in Thus Spake Zarathustra and elsewhere:
<BR>
life – existence, time, the universe, what have you – repeats itself over
<BR>
and over again, without cease. There are signs that Nietzsche really
<BR>
believed that this was the nature of the universe, and that modern science
<BR>
bore him out, but most of his commentators have charitably assumed that
<BR>
&quot;Eternal Recurrence&quot; is in fact a sort of metaphor or moral injunction:
<BR>
live your life in such a way that you would be content for every moment of
<BR>
it to be repeated again and again and again into infinity. In either case,
<BR>
Nietzsche's message is clear: be a man or, rather, a Superman – just accept
<BR>
it. 
<BR>
<P>F is for Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche 
<BR>
<P>Nietzsche's sister: by turns a neurotically protective and vengeful
<BR>
guardian of his sexual purity; a wife to one of the men Nietzsche most
<BR>
despised, a co-founder of a bizarre proto-fascist colony in Paraguay; a
<BR>
nurse of her now-deranged brother; and the High Priestess of the Nietzsche
<BR>
cult, which began in the last decade of his life and was later adopted by
<BR>
Hitler's gang. 
<BR>
<P>G is for Gay Science 
<BR>
<P>Or, in German, Die fröhliche Wissenschaft, Nietzsche's translation of la
<BR>
gaya scienza or gai saber, meaning the art of the Provençal Troubadours,
<BR>
&quot;those splendid, inventive men... to whom Europe owes so much and, indeed,
<BR>
almost itself&quot;. It has absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality. At any
<BR>
rate, that's what you should tell those ill-mannered people who give you
<BR>
funny looks when they catch you reading The Gay Science on the bus. 
<BR>
<P>H is for Heine 
<BR>
<P>Nietzsche admired the German-Jewish poet Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) with an
<BR>
unflagging passion. &quot;The highest conception of the lyric poet was given me
<BR>
by Heinrich Heine. I seek in vain in all the realms of the millennia for an
<BR>
equally sweet and passionate music... One day it will be said that Heine
<BR>
and I have been by far the foremost artists of the German language – at an
<BR>
incalculable distance from anything mere Germans have done with it...&quot;
<BR>
(Ecce Homo). (The &quot;mere Germans&quot; crack needs a footnote: Nietzsche managed
<BR>
to persuade himself, on exceptionally skimpy evidence, that he was
<BR>
descended from Polish noblemen. He was not.) 
<BR>
<P>I is for Insanity 
<BR>
<P>On the morning of 3 January 1889, Nietzsche leaves his lodgings in Turin,
<BR>
sees a cabman beating his horse, rushes to save the poor beast, throws his
<BR>
arms around its neck and passes out. When he revives, he is uncontrollable,
<BR>
and starts firing off megalomanical letters to the crowned heads of Europe.
<BR>
His sanity is gone for ever, and he spends the remaining 11 years of his
<BR>
life as a withdrawn invalid, unaware that he has in the meantime become one
<BR>
of the most famous writers in the world. Likely cause of his insanity:
<BR>
syphilis, contracted from a prostitute in one of his rare, youthful
<BR>
debauches. 
<BR>
<P>J is for Jews 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are Jewish&quot;: traditional
<BR>
mating call of the anti-Semite. Well, some of his best friends were indeed
<BR>
Jewish, notably his fellow philosopher, Paul Ree; but it's a lot more
<BR>
revealing to note that one of his worst enemies – his brother-in-law, the
<BR>
professional bigot Bernhard Forster – was a rabid anti-Semite, and that he
<BR>
despised the man's views (&quot;This accursed anti-Semitism&quot;) as much as his
<BR>
person. It's true that Nietzsche did write some weirdly disparaging things
<BR>
about the Jews, but then he wrote weirdly disparaging things about almost
<BR>
everyone except the Ancient Greeks, including the Germans and the English.
<BR>
The rumour that Nietzsche was vilely anti-Semitic owes more to the
<BR>
editorial jiggery-pokery of his sister and the unsavoury nature of some of
<BR>
his fans than it does to the printed record. If anything, the
<BR>
characteristic Nietzschean note is markedly philo-Semitic: &quot;What a blessing
<BR>
a Jew is among Germans!&quot; (The Will to Power, I, 49). 
<BR>
<P>K is for Kant 
<BR>
<P>That is, the great German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804); Nietzsche
<BR>
seldom passed up the opportunity to point out that he was utterly wrong
<BR>
about almost everything. 
<BR>
<P>L is for Lou Salome 
<BR>
<P>When they make the Nietzsche biopic, Lou Salome will be the major romantic
<BR>
interest: Nietzsche fell for the 21-year-old in 1882, proposed to her and
<BR>
was rejected twice, and ended up briefly in a ménage à trois with Miss Lou
<BR>
and Paul Ree. (Probably sexless, at least on Nietzsche's part.) When the
<BR>
ménage dissolved, he left in a rage; the later part of his life remained as
<BR>
loveless as the earlier. 
<BR>
<P>M is for Maxims 
<BR>
<P>Aphorisms, maxims, apopthegms and dicta are the essence of Nietzsche's
<BR>
literary genius. &quot;What does not destroy me, makes me stronger&quot; (Twilight of
<BR>
the Idols, aphorism 8); or &quot;He who fights with monsters should look to it
<BR>
that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an
<BR>
abyss the abyss also gazes into you&quot; (Beyond Good and Evil, aphorism 146). 
<BR>
<P>N is for Nazis 
<BR>
<P>They revered him as a prophet, they built him a museum in Weimar, they
<BR>
poisoned his name for generations. And there are extremely strong grounds
<BR>
for saying that they got him dead wrong. He derided Germans and Germany,
<BR>
held racism in lofty contempt, scorned ideas of racial purity... 
<BR>
<P>O is for Overcoming 
<BR>
<P>A key term of his later writings: it refers chiefly to self-overcoming, and
<BR>
the route towards the superhuman: see U is for Übermensch. 
<BR>
<P>P is for Power 
<BR>
<P>The Will to Power is a keystone of Nietzsche's psychology and cosmology,
<BR>
the constant theme of his mature thought: the whole universe is a
<BR>
battleground of contending wills, he believed, and the fight for supremacy
<BR>
visible in every manifestation of life (he developed the idea from a
<BR>
radical re-reading of the work of Schopenhauer, the first writer to wake
<BR>
him up to his vocation as a philosopher); The Will to Power is a posthumous
<BR>
collection of his notes and jottings, authorised by Elizabeth
<BR>
Forster-Nietzsche ,and variously regarded as (a) the pinnacle of his
<BR>
philosophical career, (b) a hopeless mess and (c) neither of the above.
<BR>
Sample extract: 
<BR>
<P>Q is for Quality 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Qualities are an idiosyncrasy peculiar to man; to demand that our human
<BR>
interpretations and values should be universal and perhaps constitutive
<BR>
values is one of the hereditary madnesses of human pride&quot; (The Will to
<BR>
Power, section 565). 
<BR>
<P>R is for Ressentiment 
<BR>
<P>Roughly: the feelings of rancour, hatred and envy inevitably experienced by
<BR>
the rabble when they confront the noble, the true and the great; and, then,
<BR>
the system of life-hating ethics created by the herd in revenge. For
<BR>
Nietzsche, the &quot;herd religion&quot; of Christianity is the most triumphant, and
<BR>
so disastrous, historical flower of ressentiment. 
<BR>
<P>S is for Socrates 
<BR>
<P>A casual reading of Nietzsche leaves one with the impression that he
<BR>
despised the Greek philosopher: &quot;Socrates was rabble.&quot; But more subtle
<BR>
readers have argued that Nietzsche identified with him strongly, modelled
<BR>
some of his style on the mocking Socratic method, and that in arguing
<BR>
against Socrates he was really arguing with himself. 
<BR>
<P>T is for Twilight of the Idols 
<BR>
<P>Sub-titled &quot;How to Philosophise with a Hammer&quot;, this is the late work which
<BR>
&quot;says in 10 sentences what everyone else says in a book – what everyone
<BR>
else does not say in a book&quot;. It's not a bad place for the interested
<BR>
beginner to start – certainly better than the work most often recommended,
<BR>
Thus Spake Zarathustra, which can be dull and repetitive. 
<BR>
<P>U is for Übermensch 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I teach you the Superman. Man is a thing to be surmounted. What have ye
<BR>
done to surmount him?... What is the ape to man? A jest or a thing of
<BR>
shame. So shall man be to Superman – a thing of jest or shame...&quot;(Thus
<BR>
Spake Zarathustra, Introductory Discourse). The Superman is at once
<BR>
Nietzsche's best-known and most variously interpreted idea, and it hasn't
<BR>
done his reputation a lot of good. As the wording of Zarathustra suggests,
<BR>
though, there is at least one clear thing about it: Nietzsche had been
<BR>
reading his Darwin. 
<BR>
<P>V is for Values 
<BR>
<P>&quot;One knows my demand of philosophers that they place themselves beyond good
<BR>
and evil – that they have the illusion of moral judgement beneath them.
<BR>
This demand follows from an insight first formulated by me: that there are
<BR>
no moral facts whatever...&quot; (Twilight of the Idols) 
<BR>
<P>W is for Wagner 
<BR>
<P>The most intense relationship of Nietzsche's life was that which he enjoyed
<BR>
and suffered with the composer Richard Wagner: it went through all the
<BR>
classic stages of infatuation, discipleship, disillusion and repudiation,
<BR>
and left the fragments of a fascinating oedipal narrative in a series of
<BR>
books from The Birth of Tragedy (1870-1) to The Wagner Case (1888) and
<BR>
Nietzsche Contra Wagner (1888-9). 
<BR>
<P>X is for Xymphora 
<BR>
<P>The Greek word for &quot;misfortune&quot;: in the Genealogy of Morals (I, ii),
<BR>
Nietzsche observes that it was a word applied by the sublimely confident
<BR>
nobility to the wretched lower orders. A study of etymology, he asserted,
<BR>
will teach the same lesson again and again: that all the words for &quot;good&quot;
<BR>
ultimately derive from the nobility and that all the words for &quot;bad&quot;
<BR>
originally signify &quot;common&quot; or &quot;plebeian.&quot; Discuss. 
<BR>
<P>Y is for Yea-Saying 
<BR>
<P>If forced to condense Nietzsche's ethical doctrine into a single slogan,
<BR>
one could do a lot worse than: &quot;Just say Yes.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Z is for Zarathustra 
<BR>
<P>Of course. Let him have the last word: &quot;I say unto you: a man must have
<BR>
chaos yet within him to be able to give birth to a dancing star. I say unto
<BR>
you: ye have chaos yet within you...&quot;
