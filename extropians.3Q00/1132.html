<P>
Scerir's post involving the use of quantum random number generators, etc...
<BR>
in conjunction with &quot;psi&quot; phenomena caused a bunch of things I've been
<BR>
reading to crystallize into a fairly complicated question.
<BR>
<P>First, some background.
<BR>
<P>I've just finished reading Chalmer's &quot;The Conscious Mind.&quot; Towards the end
<BR>
of that book Chalmers has a chapter in which he discusses several
<BR>
interpretations of quantum mechanics and their relationship towards his
<BR>
theory of consciousness. As I understand his theory, consciousness is one of
<BR>
the postulated fundamental &quot;things&quot; in the universe, along with space/time
<BR>
and mass/energy, but it is invariably associated with certain patterns of
<BR>
matter/energy. Sort of straddling the fence between matieralism and dualism,
<BR>
I thought. At least knowing where he was going made slogging through all the
<BR>
epistimelogy easier :) He spends a significant part of this chapter on the
<BR>
Everett Interpretation, which, as I understood it, says that, in lieu of
<BR>
there being some mechanism associated with consciousness that causes spread
<BR>
out probability waves to &quot;collapse&quot; into discrete conventional histories,
<BR>
our minds are in the same superposition, and thus only perceive a small part
<BR>
of the massive wave function that is reality.
<BR>
<P>I've also just recently re-read Greg Egan's Diaspora, in which (no spoilers)
<BR>
femtomachines, the nuclear particle equivalent of molecular nanotechnology,
<BR>
play a prominent role.
<BR>
<P>Molecular nanotechnonological devices are orders of magnitude too large to
<BR>
experience quantum effects, but there seems to be no fundamental engineering
<BR>
issues (that an SI couldn't resolve :)) preventing femtomachines being built
<BR>
small enough to enter into quantum superpositions with other femtomachines,
<BR>
or other particles of similar size.
<BR>
<P>Accordingly, postulate the existence of a femto-robot. A device
<BR>
approxiamately the size of a large particle that can manipulate other
<BR>
particles it's size and smaller, but be small enough to be swallowed in a
<BR>
quantum superpsoition with other particles, like the particles that form the
<BR>
bits in the register of a quantum computer.
<BR>
<P>What would be the effect on the robot's functioning, if any, if it is placed
<BR>
into superposition with a series of particles, with preprogrammed
<BR>
instructions to perform some manipulation of those particles within the
<BR>
superposed state? What if the robot was placed in superpsotiion with another
<BR>
robot with different programming? Of course I realize that the particles in
<BR>
superposition must remain completely separated form the outside environment
<BR>
for the duration of the superposition, but the examples I've seen (quite
<BR>
reasonably) did not mention the possibility of particles with behavior
<BR>
orders of magnitude more complex then the behavior of a normal electron :)
<BR>
<P>And what relation does any of this blue-sky speculation have to
<BR>
non-locality, superposition, wave function collapse, and/or other quantum
<BR>
phenomenon generally regarded as the most plausible physical causes of
<BR>
whatever &quot;psi&quot; phenomenon may exist?
<BR>
<P>If anyone has any idea, or if anyone knows whether the whole mental model
<BR>
that spawned this question is fundamentally broken :), by all means, let me
<BR>
know.
<BR>
<P>We learn by asking questions...

&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, a clean source of random numbers is, perhaps, also this one

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the far future you could also use quantum analyzers, and you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;could also perform psi experiments by means of ... quantum robots!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting argument is the Reichenbach's common cause principle
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which is often called into question when they perform experiments about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(quantum) nonlocality
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9806074">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9806074</A>

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Classical (non quantum) nonlocality was sometimes theoretically showed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(superluminal solutions of Maxwell field, etc.) i:e.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003075">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003075</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A quantum-informational methodology (about cognitive,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;psychological, social ans anomalous! phenomena) was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes sketched, i.e.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003016">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0003016</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but I think that the s.c. *structural instability* criterion
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is more useful, if we want to build a consistent theory
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of psi phenomena.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Geneva quantum optics group is working
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;very hard on nonlocality, *cosmic* frame, special relativity,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a review article is:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006053">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0006053</A>
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A very strange *ghost* nonlocality was also shown recently
<BR>
