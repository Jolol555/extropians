<P><EM>&gt; The problem here, which I haven't seen mentioned is that most of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  latter things are expected to be taught to people by their families
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as they grow up. The fact that we have to now consider moving them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  into schooling shows just how bad our &quot;home education&quot; system has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gotten in many cases. If you do try to move many of these subjects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  into schools you are going to have a real debate on your hands as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;what is the best diet?&quot;, &quot;what are the best economic theories?&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;what is the best philosophy?&quot;.. you see where I am going. There would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be a huge flamewar in every school district. If the schools were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  private though, it might work since each school could specialize in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a certain way of looking at the world and teach/brainwash that to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  their students. Of course this viewpoint would be exactly the same as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the parents who are paying the fees- essentially getting the same effect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I think as if these subjects had simply been taught at home as they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  are now. Am I cynical?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I think the most important underlying point is: just because a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  people happen to live in the USA doesn't mean they are well suited to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it. As has been noted, some people are in fact not even able to deal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with it. And some people like many on this list find it too restricting.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The education system is not going to totally fix this even if you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  able to agree on (good luck) a social contract curriculum. It's a deeper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  problem I think- a one size fits all government applied to a bell curve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of people and lifestyles.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you Brian, that a person's family should teach them the basic 
<BR>
terms of the social contract of the society in which a person will live.  But 
<BR>
many things have happened that have made this ineffective in the US in the 
<BR>
current age.  First, there ARE a lot of immigrants here, which means that 
<BR>
much of the &quot;social education&quot; people got in childhood doesn't &quot;fit&quot; the 
<BR>
society they've come to live in.  Second, people are much more mobile now 
<BR>
than they were 100 or even 50 years ago, and the IMPLICIT social contract 
<BR>
that comes with living all of one's life among the same people just doesn't 
<BR>
work for a society of people that grows up in one (or more) communities, goes 
<BR>
to college in another, and works in three or four more.
<BR>
<P>I also agree that making education in the &quot;basic deal&quot; of our society part of 
<BR>
a uniform public school curriculum isn't the ideal and certainly not the 
<BR>
final answer; and also that it would ignite a lot of public debate.  But 
<BR>
that's sort of the idea behind what I was lamenting: We NEED to talk more 
<BR>
about the fact that we expect people to take care of themselves as the 
<BR>
default assumption.  The fact that so few people actually annunciate this as 
<BR>
a basic principle is symptomatic of a kind of &quot;civic blindness&quot; that won't 
<BR>
get better by ignoring it (which I don't think you were advocating)
<BR>
.
