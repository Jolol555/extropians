<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, corporations receive limitations on their liability.  So if,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for example, a simple business partnership up the block from me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accidentally causes my house to be blown up, I might be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; successfully sue the business owners to recover damages.  But if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very same people have organized the otherwise identical business as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; corporation and do the very same thing, due to their magical limited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; liability, the corporation must pay but the stockholders do not, since
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their liability is limited.  Now, perhaps the corporation does not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possess the resources to pay, but the stockholders do.  In that case I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believe I would be out of luck.  Of course there are sometimes ways to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;pierce the corporate veil&quot; (sounds exciting doesn't it?).  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; different standards of liability apply in different cases.  IANAL.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But still, people incorporate for the liability limitations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The only difference in the two instances could be that in the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case the business might be a simple partnership, and in the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case it was a corporation, having duly filed &quot;articles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; incorporation&quot; with the secretary of state of the state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Massachusetts.  And therefore in one case I can recover damages from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the business owners and in the other case I might not.  This strikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; me as something which materially affects me to which I never agreed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nonsense!  Why should passive investors be responsible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for you house blowing-up.  What about the officers of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Corporation or the employees actually responsible for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error?
</EM><BR>
<P>This issue comes up time and again in libertarian and free market circles.
<BR>
It's almost like our version of the abortion debate -- or the identity
<BR>
debate that flares up among cryonicists and uploaders.
<BR>
<P>While I doubt anything said here will convince anyone, much less settle the
<BR>
matter, James above comments seem only to matter if the partnership or other
<BR>
unincorporated business is run like an ownership.  I mean, why should
<BR>
corporate investors get off if partners don't?  The matter seems to be one
<BR>
of managerial responsibility.  Corporate investors, in a sense, hire a board
<BR>
to manage the corporation, but partners and sole owners generally run it
<BR>
themselves.
<BR>
<P>But that said, shouldn't this be decided on what is actually the case rather
<BR>
than the labels attached?  I mean if you agree that managers should be held
<BR>
responsible -- or more responsible for day to day mistakes -- than
<BR>
investors, shouldn't this same logic be applied elsewhere?  A partner who
<BR>
merely puts his money into, say, a oil well but does not otherwise manage it
<BR>
should not, by this logic, be held responsible for that well blowing up and
<BR>
destroying several nearby buildings.  Ditto for sole proprietorships where
<BR>
the sole proprietor hires a manager to run things.  If you don't agree, what
<BR>
gives corporations special status here?
<BR>
<P>(I'm not arguing for or against corporations, just trying to deal with an
<BR>
inconsistency I see here.  Or am I wrong?)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
