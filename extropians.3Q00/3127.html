<P>Soya alert over cancer
<BR>
and brain damage link
<BR>
<P>Special report: what's wrong with our food?
<BR>
<P>by Antony Barnett, public affairs editor
<BR>
Sunday August 13, 2000
<BR>
<P>A health warning was sounded last night over the
<BR>
dangers of eating soya after two senior American
<BR>
government scientists revealed that chemicals in the
<BR>
product could increase the risk of breast cancer in
<BR>
women, brain damage in men and abnormalities in
<BR>
infants.
<BR>
<P>The disclosure, which sent shockwaves through the
<BR>
multi-billion dollar food industry, came after the
<BR>
scientists decided to break ranks with colleagues in
<BR>
the US Food and Drug Administration and oppose its
<BR>
decision last year to approve a health claim that
<BR>
soya reduced the risk of heart disease. They wrote
<BR>
an internal protest letter warning of 28 studies
<BR>
revealing toxic effects of soya.
<BR>
<P>In an interview with The Observer, one of the
<BR>
scientists, Daniel Doerge, an expert on soya, said:
<BR>
'We have very real worries that this health claim will
<BR>
be used by the industry as an endorsement of much
<BR>
wider health benefits to soya beyond the heart.
<BR>
Research has shown a clear link between soya and
<BR>
the potential for adverse effects in humans.'
<BR>
<P>BSE and other health scares related to meat have led
<BR>
to rocketing sales of soya-related products in Britain.
<BR>
But it is not just vegetarian foods such as tofu that
<BR>
use soya. It is a key ingredient in products from meat
<BR>
sausages and fish fingers to salad creams and
<BR>
breakfast cereals.
<BR>
<P>The concerns of Doerge and fellow FDA researcher
<BR>
Daniel Sheehan focus on chemicals in soya known as
<BR>
isoflavones which have effects similar to the female
<BR>
hormone oestrogen.
<BR>
<P>While these chemicals may help to prevent a range of
<BR>
conditions including high cholesterol, they also lead
<BR>
to health problems in animals including altering
<BR>
sexual development of foetuses and causing thyroid
<BR>
disorders. Although soy is thought to protect against
<BR>
breast cancer, some studies show that chemicals in
<BR>
soya may increase the chances of breast cancer
<BR>
which uses oestrogen-type hormones for growth.
<BR>
<P>Their letter to the FDA seen by The Observer states:
<BR>
'There is abundant evidence that some of the
<BR>
isoflavones found in soy demonstrate toxicity in
<BR>
oestrogen sensitive tissues and in the thyroid.
<BR>
Additionally, the adverse effects in humans occur
<BR>
in several tissues.
<BR>
<P>'During pregnancy in humans, isoflavones per se
<BR>
could be a risk factor for abnormal brain and
<BR>
reproductive tract development.'
<BR>
<P>This will frighten mothers who increasingly use soya
<BR>
milk for babies. Doerge said: 'They are exposing their
<BR>
children to chemicals which we know have adverse
<BR>
effects in animals. It's like doing a large uncontrolled
<BR>
and unmonitored experiment on infants.'
<BR>
<P>The soya industry insists that most research shows
<BR>
the health benefits of soya outweigh risks and that
<BR>
adverse effects seen in animals do not apply to humans.
<BR>
<P>Richard Barnes, European director of the US Soy
<BR>
Bean Association, said: 'Millions of people around the
<BR>
world have been eating soya for years and have shown
<BR>
no signs of abnormalities or disorders.'
