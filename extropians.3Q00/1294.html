<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Research tends to support
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that hypothesis. For example, several
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;studies show that raising 5HT routinely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impairs memory, such that the higher the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level of synaptic 5HT, the lower memory.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One study composed of multiple substudies
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concluded that &quot;excessive release, but not
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depletion, of serotonin produces profound
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retention performance impairment.&quot; These
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;studies used PCA, which causes a sudden
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release of 5HT, followed by depletion,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cognitive impairment seems to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linked to the increased release. Now,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's not the same mechanism SSRIs
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exert to increase synaptic 5HT levels,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it's probably reasonable to extrapolate
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those finding to increased synaptic 5HT per se.

<P>Excessive serotonin release, not depletion, leads to memory
<BR>
impairments in rats.
<BR>
<P>Santucci AC, Knott PJ, Haroutunian V
<BR>
<P>Psychiatry Service, Bronx VA Medical Center, NY 10468, USA.
<BR>
<P>Eight experiments compared and contrasted the effects
<BR>
of serotonin release and depletion on performance by
<BR>
rats in two tests of memory. Most experiments
<BR>
(Experiments 1-5) examined the effects of the serotonergic
<BR>
releasing/depleting agent p-chloroamphetamine on passive
<BR>
avoidance performance. Additional experiments explored
<BR>
p-chloroamphetamine's effects on retention performance
<BR>
by animals trained in an 8-arm radial maze (Experiment 6),
<BR>
and the effects of dorsal raphe nucleus lesions on passive
<BR>
avoidance in animals treated with (Experiment 8) or not
<BR>
treated with (Experiment 7) p-chloroamphetamine. In general,
<BR>
acute increases in serotonin release produced consistent
<BR>
and extensive retention performance deficits in both
<BR>
passive avoidance and radial arm maze. Results from an
<BR>
ancillary control experiment indicated that the
<BR>
p-chloroamphetamine-induced passive avoidance impairment
<BR>
was not related to drug-induced alterations in pain
<BR>
sensitivity. Other experiments ruled out the possibility
<BR>
that p-chloroamphetamine was disrupting passive avoidance
<BR>
retention performance by affecting post-trial consolidation
<BR>
processes, producing state-dependent retention, having
<BR>
direct effects at postsynaptic receptors, or indirectly
<BR>
by affecting non-serotonergic neurotransmitter systems.
<BR>
Depletion of serotonin resulting from either the
<BR>
long-term residual effects of p-chloroamphetamine or
<BR>
lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus failed to alter
<BR>
passive avoidance retention scores although it produced
<BR>
extensive depletion (45-85%) of serotonin and
<BR>
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cortex and hippocampus.
<BR>
These data contribute to the growing body of literature
<BR>
indicating an important role of serotonin in cognitive
<BR>
processes by demonstrating that excessive release, but
<BR>
not depletion, of serotonin produces profound retention
<BR>
performance impairment.

<P>Analysis of the avoidance learning deficit induced by

the serotonin releasing compound p-chloroamphetamine.

<P>Ogren SO
<BR>
<P>The effects of the serotonin-releasing compound
<BR>
p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, 2.5 mg/kg) on avoidance
<BR>
acquisition, retention and memory retrieval were examined
<BR>
in male Sprague-Dawley rats using a one-way active avoidance
<BR>
and a one-trial passive avoidance task. The drug was injected
<BR>
IP prior to training, following acquisition and prior to the
<BR>
retention test 24 hr after training using a state-dependent
<BR>
design. In the normal context situation pretraining
<BR>
administration of PCA markedly impaired active avoidance
<BR>
acquisition, but PCA-treated rats did not differ from
<BR>
controls in their retention performance when tested 24 hr
<BR>
after training. In the dark/light box test pretraining
<BR>
administration of PCA caused a dose-dependent impairment of
<BR>
both active and passive avoidance retention which could not
<BR>
be explained in terms of changes in locomotor activity or
<BR>
behavioural disinhibition at the time of testing or state-
<BR>
dependent retention. Post-training administration of PCA
<BR>
failed to affect avoidance retention in both tasks. The
<BR>
drug was found to impair memory retrieval in a dose- and
<BR>
time-dependent fashion in the one-way active but not in
<BR>
the passive avoidance test. Pretraining administration of
<BR>
PCA produced a progressive loss of passive and active
<BR>
avoidance performance at increasingly longer retention
<BR>
intervals. The present results suggest that serotonin has
<BR>
dual effects on processes underlying learning and memory
<BR>
involving effects on both associative and non-associative
<BR>
learning processes in the rat. The time-dependent loss of
<BR>
memory retention following 5-HT release indicates that
<BR>
serotonin has a role in the way information is processed
<BR>
in the brain.

<P>Serotonin receptor involvement in the avoidance learning

deficit caused by p-chloroamphetamine-induced serotonin

release.
<BR>
<P>Ogren SO
<BR>
<P>The receptor involvement in the p-chloramphetamine (PCA,
<BR>
2.5 mg kg-1) induced impairment of active avoidance
<BR>
acquisition was examined in the male rat. The avoidance
<BR>
deficit was blocked at low doses by serotonergic
<BR>
(5-HT)-receptor blocking agents but not by alpha-adrenergic-,
<BR>
beta-adrenergic-, opiate-, muscarinic- or dopamine D2-receptor
<BR>
antagonists. The potency of the 5-HT antagonists to block
<BR>
the PCA-induced deficit correlated with their affinity in
<BR>
displacing [3H]ketanserin but not [3H]5-HT binding in the
<BR>
frontal cortex. The potencies of the 5-HT antagonists to
<BR>
block the action of PCA could not be related to their
<BR>
action on muscarinic-, histaminergic H1- or dopaminergic
<BR>
D2-receptor binding in vitro. It is concluded that the
<BR>
avoidance learning deficit caused by PCA-induced 5-HT
<BR>
release is related to activation of 5-HT receptors in
<BR>
the frontal cortex having the characteristics of a 5-HT2
<BR>
receptor.

<P>5-Hydroxytryptamine and learning: long-term effects of

P-chloroamphetamine on acquisition.
<BR>
<P>Ogren S, Ross SB, Baumann L
<BR>
<P>The effect of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) on the acquisition
<BR>
of a conditioned avoidance response in the rat was examined.
<BR>
Eleven rats were injected with saline or 2 X 10 mg/kg of PCA
<BR>
i.p. on two consecutive days and the learning procedure was
<BR>
started eight days later and lasted for six days. The
<BR>
acquisition of the conditioned avoidance response was strongly
<BR>
impaired by PCA compared with the control group. It is
<BR>
suggested that the impaired learning is due to a long-term
<BR>
effect of PCA on a 5-hydroxytryptamine system directly or
<BR>
indirectly linked to learning.
