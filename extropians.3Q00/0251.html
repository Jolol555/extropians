<P><P>Heh!  Okay, for most people it isn't that bad.  You generally have to be
<BR>
vocally non-mainstream in an unpopular manner or a real career criminal
<BR>
to end up on the Clinton shit-list.  The vast majority of the population
<BR>
doesn't fit this profile, although a non-trivial percentage of people on
<BR>
this list would probably make it on the list of &quot;people to smack down if
<BR>
they get uppity&quot;.  Fortunately (or unfortunately depending how you look at
<BR>
it), they are more like the Keystone cops with machine guns; their
<BR>
incompetence compounded by arrogance makes them a menace, but it also
<BR>
makes it relatively easy to dodge any legal issues they try and throw at
<BR>
you.
<BR>
<P>I think I just know all the wrong people (vocal, active libertarians), so
<BR>
it makes the occurence seem more frequent than it actually is.  During
<BR>
the second half of last year, probably a half dozen people I know were
<BR>
&quot;visited&quot; by these goons primarily for the purpose of harassment.  Maybe
<BR>
it was a Y2K thing, though still inappropriate, and other than &quot;losing&quot; a
<BR>
few items no one is the worse for wear.  I expect things to improve when
<BR>
Clinton is out of office.
<BR>
<P>I think Mr. Broderick would be quite safe from the Black Helicopters
<BR>
and their evil minions here.  :^)
