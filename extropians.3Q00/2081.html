<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
<EM>&gt; It is very foolish for anyone to claim &quot;ownership&quot; of a piece of digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.  If something can be easily attained by anyone at almost no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost at all, and the price for prosecuting the MILLIONS of people
</EM><BR>
attaining
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it is prohibitively high, then that something is essentially free.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recording industry (and the motion picture industry and the book
</EM><BR>
publishers,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. etc.) can whine all they want, but their claim is akin to me claiming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I own all the air in a 20 foot radius about my body - I can't keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone from breathing it, I can't track everyone who is breathing it or
</EM><BR>
has
<BR>
<EM>&gt; previously breathed it, and I don't even know where all of it is at any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given time.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Ho hum.
<BR>
<P>This argument is getting boring.  Not your fault, but it's been endlessly
<BR>
repeated by so many dot com fast trackers that its starting to lose its
<BR>
meaning.
<BR>
<P>It goes like this: &quot;You can't own it, you can't track it, you can't control
<BR>
it, so why even bother?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Which is a defeatist attitude.  There are two distinct issues here:  a) is
<BR>
it -desirable- to own it? and b) is it -possible- to own it?  Arguing
<BR>
against 'b' is not a good way to argue against 'a.'  If it *is* desirable
<BR>
then we should get more imaginative about making it possible.  If it's *not*
<BR>
desirable, then you should argue that position.
<BR>
<P>Okay, so maybe I'm just not a fan of &quot;it's impossible, it's can't be done,
<BR>
don't even bother,&quot; statements, I -am- a transhumanist after all, and
<BR>
somehow I don't think that the &quot;law of information must be free,&quot; is as
<BR>
immutable as the speed of light barrier.  (Oops, did we break that one?)
<BR>
People who say its going to be &quot;impossible&quot; to protect information in the
<BR>
future need to stretch their imaginations a little.
<BR>
<P>If we decide we want to be able to protect something that comes out of our
<BR>
own head, then we look for ways to do so.  You claim that encryption will be
<BR>
only a minor annoyance in the future: if that's true, then we've got some
<BR>
big issues.  Being able to protect information is only going to become more
<BR>
and more important.  I wonder if the &quot;information must be free&quot; advocates
<BR>
include personal data and private communications in their manifesto?
<BR>
<P>Do you think I'm going to put my -brain- online when any mad hacker kid can
<BR>
come along and tinker with it?  &quot;Check it out doodz, I hacked Jupiter Brain
<BR>
K777 into a raving lunatic.  -And- he does my accounting!&quot;
<BR>
<P>If it becomes possible for me to easily read your mind would you advocate a
<BR>
means of protecting -that- information?  Or would you shrug and say, &quot;it's
<BR>
information!  It's like air!  I can't control it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My vision of a desirable future includes a fully networked frictionless
<BR>
information matrix and lots of secure nodes of (nearly?) absolute privacy.
<BR>
In my opinion, the technology for protecting your personal information IS
<BR>
going to be possible-- I don't share the defeatist attitude expressed above.
<BR>
I think the concept of -absolute- freedom is bunk... the concept of freedom
<BR>
only exists in a world with barriers to freedom-- &quot;un&quot;freedom creates the
<BR>
value in &quot;freedom.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Individuals should be empowered with the means to control their own
<BR>
information, including the ability to release it into a frictionless medium
<BR>
and let it replicate indefinitely.  They should be able to make the
<BR>
determination of what stays private and what becomes public.  And in the
<BR>
absence of good technological security, do I think that we should
<BR>
collectively agree to protect that information through legal means?
<BR>
Absolutely.  People always get up in arms about this: &quot;I don't want
<BR>
government bureaucracy interfering with my freedom!&quot;  But humans have always
<BR>
understood the importance of social contracts, ever since the first time we
<BR>
figured out that the right of your fist ends where the right of my nose
<BR>
begins.
<BR>
<P>A recent farcical 'fairytale' posted to this list perpetrated the idea that
<BR>
we needed to return to simpler times-- if only we were to get rid of all
<BR>
those stuffy &quot;laws&quot; then we could live in peace and harmony with each other,
<BR>
and dance with unicorns and what not.  (Hello entropy?)
<BR>
<P>I anticipate us requiring more intricate rule sets to enable us to
<BR>
successfully interact with each other in the future and this is simply a
<BR>
testament to the increasing complexity and depth of those interactions.
