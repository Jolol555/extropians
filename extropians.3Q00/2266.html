<EM>&gt;Date: Thu, 27 Jul 2000 11:54:14 -0700
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
There are two distinct issues here:  a) is
<BR>
<EM>&gt;it -desirable- to own it? and b) is it -possible- to own it?  Arguing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against 'b' is not a good way to argue against 'a.'  If it *is* desirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then we should get more imaginative about making it possible.  If it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*not*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;desirable, then you should argue that position.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Okay, so maybe I'm just not a fan of &quot;it's impossible, it's can't be done,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't even bother,&quot; statements, I -am- a transhumanist after all, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;somehow I don't think that the &quot;law of information must be free,&quot; is as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immutable as the speed of light barrier.  (Oops, did we break that one?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;People who say its going to be &quot;impossible&quot; to protect information in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future need to stretch their imaginations a little.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If we decide we want to be able to protect something that comes out of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;own head, then we look for ways to do so.  You claim that encryption will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only a minor annoyance in the future: if that's true, then we've got some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;big issues.  Being able to protect information is only going to become more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and more important.  I wonder if the &quot;information must be free&quot; advocates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;include personal data and private communications in their manifesto?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Do you think I'm going to put my -brain- online when any mad hacker kid can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come along and tinker with it?  &quot;Check it out doodz, I hacked Jupiter Brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;K777 into a raving lunatic.  -And- he does my accounting!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If it becomes possible for me to easily read your mind would you advocate a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;means of protecting -that- information?  Or would you shrug and say, &quot;it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information!  It's like air!  I can't control it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My vision of a desirable future includes a fully networked frictionless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information matrix and lots of secure nodes of (nearly?) absolute privacy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In my opinion, the technology for protecting your personal information IS
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;going to be possible-- I don't share the defeatist attitude expressed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;above.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think the concept of -absolute- freedom is bunk... the concept of freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only exists in a world with barriers to freedom-- &quot;un&quot;freedom creates the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;value in &quot;freedom.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Individuals should be empowered with the means to control their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information, including the ability to release it into a frictionless medium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and let it replicate indefinitely.  They should be able to make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;determination of what stays private and what becomes public.  And in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;absence of good technological security, do I think that we should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;collectively agree to protect that information through legal means?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Absolutely.  People always get up in arms about this: &quot;I don't want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government bureaucracy interfering with my freedom!&quot;  But humans have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understood the importance of social contracts, ever since the first time we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;figured out that the right of your fist ends where the right of my nose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;begins.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A recent farcical 'fairytale' posted to this list perpetrated the idea that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we needed to return to simpler times-- if only we were to get rid of all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those stuffy &quot;laws&quot; then we could live in peace and harmony with each 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and dance with unicorns and what not.  (Hello entropy?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I anticipate us requiring more intricate rule sets to enable us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;successfully interact with each other in the future and this is simply a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;testament to the increasing complexity and depth of those interactions.

<P>Good post.  I've suggested multiple times that a thoroughly practical and 
<BR>
likely inevitable solution to these kinds of problems would be to make that 
<BR>
nebulous social contract into a real legal document that someone could sign. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have a vast experience with things like the common law or the 
<BR>
uniform commercial code, so a simple web contract between each signatory and 
<BR>
all other signatories to use a particular system(s) to resolve disputes, 
<BR>
backed in practice by bonds, escrow, letters of credit, threat of exclusion, 
<BR>
and all the private, non-state mechanisms that businesses have evolved to 
<BR>
deal with other businesses in different jurisdictions, would likely result 
<BR>
in a practical system - if there is one - of protecting intellectual 
<BR>
property, as well as incidentally eliminating the state itself in fairly 
<BR>
short order, I suspect.
