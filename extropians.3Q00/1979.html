<EM>&gt; a huge military-industrial pork/welfare ripoff.

<P>You may be right Jeff, but remember it took only one grinch to screw up
<BR>
Whoville.  {8-]  And do not worry, I am not personally attached to National
<BR>
Missile Defense.  I think it is a good idea in the long run, and I do take a
<BR>
long view here.  Unlike most products that we are familiar with, NMD is
<BR>
something that will be at a low level of development for 30-50 years.
<BR>
If our defenses *ever* stop developing they are a sitting duck.
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, NMD may *evolve* into an attempt at nanotech grey goo
<BR>
defense eventually, as that threat becomes more apparent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Show me that this test was scheduled long in advance.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ill snoop around, see if I can find out on that.  The patriot was initially
<BR>
intended as an anti-aircraft anti-cruise missile missile, so they might
<BR>
have figured after the fact that they should at some time show that it
<BR>
can do what it was originally intended for.  I wouldnt be at all surprised
<BR>
if some Hollywood grandstanding was intentional with the current
<BR>
debates.  I do find it curious that both presidential front runners seem
<BR>
to be enthusiastic supporters of NMD.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I could go on, but I couldn't do a better job than John has of showing this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for what it is: an exercise in brain-dead, post-cold-war opportunism.
</EM><BR>
<P>I sure *hope* thats all it ever is Jeff.  Opportunism is cheap indeed.  {8-]
