Lee, I did not mean to say that one should not make a living writing and 
<BR>
seling articles to magazines. Or that songwriting for celebrities is bad. I 
<BR>
apologize fo rskipping that. I myself have apprenticed with various famous 
<BR>
artists and have learned much and made halfway OK money at it. Certainly 
<BR>
journalism(espeically if you are getting published! ; ), doing web sites and 
<BR>
writing software programs is also creative!
<BR>
<P>I did not mean to disregard your attempts to be creative.
<BR>
<P>When I work for another artist, lending my talent to their concept, I 
<BR>
certainly don't consider that making MY art, but then I don't always need to 
<BR>
be expressing my own voice. But let's not pretend it's the same.
<BR>
<P>I think that's fine if it is a steppign stone towards the goal of making your 
<BR>
own way as an artist, and it's a nice supplementary income, same as mugs and 
<BR>
posters supllement the sales of albums, movies, whatever. But it's not the 
<BR>
same as making a name for yourself and charging what you are worth.
<BR>
<P>Why did Metallica display such arrogance as to call all these people on the 
<BR>
piracy issue? Probably becasue they over value themselves. Which is a hell of 
<BR>
a lot better than undervaluing themselves.
<BR>
<P>I see two very contradictory points in your threads, Lee.
<BR>
One is that artists need to stand up for themselves and know their worth and 
<BR>
wuit being doormats.
<BR>
<P>The other is they shouldn't have  copyright laws and legal protection, 
<BR>
subsidies, unionpay scales, etc. 
<BR>
...just &quot;make it happen&quot; somehow.
<BR>
<P>--N
<BR>
<P>&quot;The capacity to tolerate complexity and welcome contradiction, not the need 
<BR>
for simplicity and certainty, is the attribute of an explorer&quot; Heinz R. 
<BR>
Pagels, Perfect Symmetry
