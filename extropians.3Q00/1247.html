<P>Pincer movement
<BR>
By Nell Boyce
<BR>
<P>ARMING mosquitoes with the venom of a scorpion sounds like a terrible idea.
<BR>
But researchers in Mexico say malaria could be stopped in its tracks by
<BR>
genetically engineering mosquitoes to produce a scorpion toxin in their gut.
<BR>
<P>For years, scientists have dreamed of displacing wild mosquitoes with
<BR>
genetically modified insects that cannot carry the malaria parasite
<BR>
Plasmodium (New Scientist,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://archive.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=19893900">http://archive.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=19893900</A>). Two weeks ago,
<BR>
researchers in Europe announced the first successful attempt to genetically
<BR>
modify the malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquito. Now, in experiments on a
<BR>
different insect, Lourival Possani and his colleagues at the National
<BR>
Autonomous University of Mexico in Cuernavaca have shown that scorpion venom
<BR>
can block the malaria parasite's development.
<BR>
<P>Possani, who studies toxins derived from scorpions, recently discovered that
<BR>
the venom of Pandinus imperator contains a peptide, which he calls scorpine,
<BR>
that blocks the development of malaria parasites growing in culture. To see
<BR>
whether scorpine has the same effect in living insects, he and his
<BR>
colleagues created transgenic fruit flies that express the gene for the
<BR>
peptide in their gut.
<BR>
<P>The researchers then injected young Plasmodium parasites directly into the
<BR>
abdomens of the transgenic flies and their normal counterparts, and compared
<BR>
how many of the parasites matured. More than 40 per cent of the normal flies
<BR>
harboured mature malaria parasites. But only 12 per cent of the flies that
<BR>
made scorpine had parasites that continued to grow, Possani told researchers
<BR>
at a recent meeting at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Chevy Chase,
<BR>
Maryland. &quot;I think it's a very promising result,&quot; he says.
<BR>
<P>Possani did his experiments in fruit flies because at the time no one had
<BR>
managed to genetically modify Anopheles mosquitoes. He knew, however, that
<BR>
David Schneider of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in
<BR>
Cambridge, Massachusetts, had shown that Plasmodium parasites injected into
<BR>
the guts of fruit flies develop in much the same way as they do in
<BR>
mosquitoes. Details of Schneider's technique were published in Science last
<BR>
week (vol 288, p 2376).
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's wonderful to know that someone else can do it,&quot; Schneider says. &quot;My
<BR>
guess is that the way we should do things is to model them in the fruit fly
<BR>
first and then hop into the mosquito.&quot;
<BR>
<P>While other types of mosquitoes have been genetically altered before, it's
<BR>
only now that Fotis Kafatos of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in
<BR>
Heidelberg and his colleagues have succeeded in modifying the
<BR>
malaria-carrying Anopheles (Nature, vol 405, p 959). In addition to
<BR>
introducing the scorpine gene, researchers would like to try a whole slew of
<BR>
other modifications to the mosquito.
<BR>
<P>Because Plasmodium adversely affects mosquitoes' lifespan and ability to
<BR>
reproduce, the researchers suspect that altered mosquitoes would outcompete
<BR>
the wild ones. But many questions remain. &quot;Once you make this thing, how do
<BR>
you drive it into the environment?&quot; wonders Schneider. &quot;I'm not sure we
<BR>
understand the ecology of it enough.&quot;
