<P>
Jeff Davis forwards:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destination Mir will Launch on NBC
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Burnett, producer of the hit show &quot;Survivor&quot;, has sold the rights
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to his new show, &quot;Destination Mir&quot; to NBC for $40 million. The show
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will follow a group of 13-15 would-be cosmonauts as they train for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a trip to the Mir space station. Each week, a contestant will be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removed by Russian Space Officials until the final winner is launched
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into orbit on a special, live broadcast. Half of the money will go to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MirCorp, to help cover the costs of the trip.  As part of the deal,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NBC has agreed to run an hour long, Burnett-produced show about Dennis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tito, the businessman who paid $20 million for the chance to fly on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mir next year. &quot;Destination Mir&quot; will air in late 2001, early 2002.
<BR>
<P>Sounds interesting, but they need to come up with a better way of
<BR>
winnowing the field.  Just having some faceless Russian bureaucrats tap
<BR>
a guy on the shoulder and send him outside won't work.  Hmmm, maybe a
<BR>
Stalinesque approach... it's the middle of the night, the door is thrown
<BR>
open, our hapless hero throws up his hands against the light as storm
<BR>
troopers with attack guards hustle him out... and he's never seen again.
<BR>
<P>Seriously, the most interesting part of the Survivor show was the politics
<BR>
and strategy involved in seeing who would get voted off.  Just having
<BR>
the space agency officials decide won't work.  They need to come up with
<BR>
some fair but dramatically interesting way to kick people off.
