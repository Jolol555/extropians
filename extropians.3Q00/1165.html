<EM>&gt;     Hardware and upload compilation will become cheap enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     profitably run uploads for lower than then-current wages when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     human labor is still highly valued (i.e., before strong AI),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     and substantially before most individuals can afford to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     non-destructively upload themselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Given this premise, most first uploads would be corporate projects,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and such uploads would have a first-mover advantage in filling niches.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think at a minimum you need to qualify this in terms of the social,
<BR>
ethical and legal attitude towards uploads.  If they are seen as humans,
<BR>
with legal rights, they could be much less profitable for corporations.
<BR>
If people have to be killed to be uploaded, the legal environment would
<BR>
have to change a great deal to allow corporations to kill people for
<BR>
profit.  All these factors are hard to predict.
<BR>
<P><P>I had written:
<BR>
<P>: The moral opposition to
<BR>
: such an effort would be overwhelming, especially when it comes from
<BR>
: people who will be put out of work if it succeeds.
<BR>
<P>Robin responded:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now opposition due to fears of being put out of work is a whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different matter.  But it isn't the same thing as these other &quot;moral&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerns you've mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right, but in practice morality and economic interest often travel
<BR>
together.  As you wrote earlier:
<BR>
<P>} It might not be right, but people can be remarkably blind when it
<BR>
} suits them.  They might not see the uploads if that would make trouble.
<BR>
<P>So here you seem to be suggesting that people would adjust their
<BR>
moral views because they would perceive uploads as being beneficial.
<BR>
I predicted the opposite effect.
<BR>
<P>An important question is whether people will view the advent of these
<BR>
uploads as advantageous for them.  On the one hand, it gives them access
<BR>
to a form of &quot;AI&quot; cheaply.  On the other hand, a substantial fraction
<BR>
of people (what percent, would you estimate?) will be thrown out of work.
<BR>
<P>People don't like losing their jobs.  That's where much of the opposition
<BR>
to immigration comes from.  My feeling is that uploads will be seen as
<BR>
far more threatening.  Rather than stand by and allow themselves to be
<BR>
replaced, people will vote restrictions on uploads.  That seems like a
<BR>
very plausible scenario to me.
