<P>
Consider this article from this morning's San Jose Merc.  Gilroy
<BR>
is about 30 miles down the street:
<BR>
<P>Gilroy Student Arrested in Attack on Schoolmate
<BR>
<P>A 15 year old Gilroy High School student has been arrested
<BR>
and charged with assaulting a schoolmate because he believed
<BR>
the victim's sexual orientation to be different from his own,
<BR>
police said.
<BR>
<P>A police official said Wednesday that the do not know the
<BR>
sexual orientation of either student and that it is not important.
<BR>
<P>The suspect told the arresting officer that he threw a small clod
<BR>
of dirt or asphalt at the victim on Tuesday because he believed
<BR>
the boy had a different sexual orientation than his own, Lt.
<BR>
Debbie Moore said.  The victim received a slight scratch on the
<BR>
arm and did not require medical attention, she said.
<BR>
<P>The student was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery,
<BR>
and a civil rights violation, what Moore referred to as
<BR>
discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<BR>
<P>High school principal Wendy Gudalweicz called it a harassment
<BR>
incident, adding no form of harassment is tolerated and that
<BR>
the youth already had been disciplined.  She declined to elaborate.
<BR>
<P>The incident occurred on the high school campus at 11:20 a.m.
<BR>
Tuesday between classes, Moore said.  There was some
<BR>
&quot;physical contact,&quot; between the boys during the incident, but it
<BR>
was not a fight or a beating, she said, declining to be more specific.
<BR>
<P>[end of article]
<BR>
<P>Reason I consider this newsworthy: students throwing rocks
<BR>
at each other is something that happens every day, but now we
<BR>
have a kid who has been arrested for assault, and was stupid
<BR>
enough to admit the reason he did it.  This changes everything,
<BR>
and not just because it is an example of a thought-crime.
<BR>
Looks to me like any high school student can now stop any
<BR>
beating or attack simply by saying &quot;Back off, Im gay.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If attacked, would I play the gay card?  In a heartbeat, yes.
<BR>
Of course it would work better if my wife of 16 years were
<BR>
not present, but yes, if attacked, mugged or accosted in
<BR>
any way, looks to me like the best defense is to claim
<BR>
to be gay.  When I was in high school, such an admission
<BR>
would have resulted in a beating, and there was no recourse
<BR>
in those days.  Now, it will not take long for every criminal to
<BR>
realize that any attack on a gay person means they will
<BR>
be lucky to get off with just life without parole.  spike
