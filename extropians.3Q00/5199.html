&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good thing about email is that the potential exists to avoid
<BR>
being identified as a particular sex.  Many women I've talked to (in
<BR>
fact, I believe every woman I've ever talked to about this has had this
<BR>
experience) have reported the following sort ot thing:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman's in a group, say, a business related meeting.  She makes a
<BR>
suggestion or states an opinion.  Everyone pretty much ignores what she
<BR>
said--maybe they look at her briefly and say &quot;Uh huh,&quot; but that's about
<BR>
it.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later one of the male participants makes the same
<BR>
suggestion or states the same opinion as the woman did earlier. 
<BR>
Everyone's very interested,  they all get excited, ask questions, etc.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a transgendered friend who says that when she was a man she
<BR>
worked on cars quite a bit.  Recently she was riding in a shuttle van
<BR>
when the air conditioning compressor began making a loud noise.  The van
<BR>
driver pulled over and sat in the sweltering heat until another van could
<BR>
come and pick everyone up.  No one would pay the slightest attention to
<BR>
my friend when she tried to tell them it was just the air conditioning
<BR>
compressor and that if they'd turn off the a/c and open the windows they
<BR>
could continue to their destination.  She says that in becoming female
<BR>
she automatically lost at least 50 IQ points in the eyes of the world.
