<P><P>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE AUGUST 2000 ISSUE
<BR>
Antioxidants under attack
<BR>
<P>Consumers of vitamin supplements have been hit with a lot of negative
<BR>
press lately, and The Life Extension Foundation has been on the forefront
<BR>
in evaluating whether these anti-supplement reports have scientific merit.
<BR>
<P>On April 10, 2000, the National Academy of Sciences issued a press release
<BR>
that stated:
<BR>
&quot;Insufficient evidence exists to support claims that taking megadoses of
<BR>
dietary antioxidants, such as selenium and vitamins C and E, or
<BR>
carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can prevent chronic diseases.&quot;
<BR>
This report received widespread media attention, and many news articles
<BR>
questioned the value of dietary supplements altogether. The National
<BR>
Academy of Sciences' press release was based on the conclusions of a
<BR>
512-page book that ostensibly looked at all the published scientific
<BR>
literature about the intake of certain nutrients and subsequent risk of
<BR>
developing disease.
<BR>
<P>The name of this 512-page book is Dietary Reference Intakes For Vitamin C,
<BR>
Vitamin E, Selenium and the Carotenoids. This book contains a startling
<BR>
contradiction. The negative conclusions drawn by the authors are opposite
<BR>
to the positive findings about the supplements that are described in the
<BR>
very same book. This contradiction is not surprising, considering that the
<BR>
book is authored by two &quot;committees&quot; comprised of 40 members.
<BR>
<P>The book omits published studies about antioxidants. It also fails to take
<BR>
into account that supplement takers usually consume a wide variety of
<BR>
nutrients to protect their health, not just vitamin C or E alone.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSVIE:  Human growth hormone helps Crohn's
<BR>
disease patients
<BR>
<P>In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers
<BR>
evaluated the effect of the administration of human growth hormone on
<BR>
thirty-seven patients with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease.
<BR>
Patients self-injected either a placebo or 5 mg growth hormone for the
<BR>
first week of the study, followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg per day.
<BR>
The study partcipants were instructed to consume least two grams of
<BR>
protein per kilogram body weight on a daily basis. Patients continued
<BR>
their other medications.  The participants scored the severity of eight
<BR>
different symptoms at the beginning and throughout the study on the
<BR>
Crohn's Disease Activity Index.   Higher scores correlated with greater
<BR>
severity of symptoms.   After one month, the patients who received the
<BR>
growth hormone had a greater decrease in scores than the placebo group.
<BR>
This improvement continued and was greater after four months at the
<BR>
conclusion of the study.  The only side effects observed in this group
<BR>
were edema and headache, which usually resolved within the first month.
<BR>
<P>Also observed at the end of the study was the ability of those who
<BR>
received growth hormone to discontinue over half of the drugs previously
<BR>
found to be necessary.  By contrast, the placebo group increased their
<BR>
drug intake by 4%.  At the end of the four months, half of the patients
<BR>
who received growth hormone and who still required medication were able to
<BR>
reduce their medication dose.
<BR>
<P>The authors of the study concluded that a large multicenter study should
<BR>
be conducted to confirm these results, which preliminarily indicate that
<BR>
growth hormone may be of help to people with Crohn's disease.
<BR>
<P><P>WHAT'S HOT
<BR>
Bacteria suspect in Crohns's disease
<BR>
<P>The July issue of the journal Gastroenterology reported on the discovery
<BR>
by researchers at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, of
<BR>
evidence of a bacteria in the affected areas of Crohn's disease. Crohn's
<BR>
disease is an incurable, chronic intestinal disorder, in which sufferers
<BR>
develop a weak and inflamed gastrointestinal tract, which causes severe
<BR>
abdominal pain and diarrhea. This leads to many related complications and
<BR>
increases the risk of colorectal cancer. The cause of Crohn's is unknown,
<BR>
but the disease has been believed to be an autoimmune disorder, in which
<BR>
the body attacks itself.
<BR>
The researchers in this report examined intestinal lesions from 212
<BR>
patients. They analyzed lesions caused by the disease and compared them to
<BR>
other intestinal mucosal tissue. A specific bacterial genetic sequence was
<BR>
present in 43% of the Crohn's lesions compared to being found in 5% of
<BR>
specimens derived from patients with noninflammatory bowel disease lesions
<BR>
and 9% of ulcerative colitis specimens. Antibodies to the sequence were
<BR>
also much higher in the serum of Crohn's disease patients than in other
<BR>
patients examined.
<BR>
<P>The method used in the study looked for DNA segments from a microorgansim
<BR>
found in Crohn's patients, but the researchers as yet have not identified
<BR>
the bacteria. It is possible that it is one that is well known, or it
<BR>
could be a new discovery. It is not known yet whether this bacteria is the
<BR>
cause of disease, but researchers hope to pinpoint its identity so that
<BR>
therapies can be developed that will target it.
<BR>
<P>This research indicates that the body's immune response to a microorgansim
<BR>
could be the culprit in Crohn's. In the same issue of Gastroenterology, Dr
<BR>
Charles O Elson commented, &quot;It seems likely that many antigens and
<BR>
microorganisms will be involved in stimulating the inflammation.&quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2859/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html">http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2859/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html</A>
<BR>
<P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Crohn's disease
<BR>
<P>Crohn's disease is a chronic disorder of the intestines. Of unknown
<BR>
etiology, the gastrointestinal tract in persons suffering from this
<BR>
disease becomes inflamed and weak, making digestion difficult and leading
<BR>
to general physical debility.  The symptoms are similar to ulcerative
<BR>
colitis, and they are both categorized as inflammatory bowel diseases; to
<BR>
distinguish between them, your doctor may need to examine a sample of
<BR>
intestinal tissue.
<BR>
<P>Crohn's disease can attack any part of your intestines from the mouth to
<BR>
the anus, but most commonly it strikes the ileum (lower portion of the
<BR>
small intestine) or the colon (large intestine). Ulcers form on the inner
<BR>
intestinal lining and eventually spread through the intestinal wall. As
<BR>
the affected part of the intestine becomes scarred and thick, the passage
<BR>
narrows, disrupting nutrient absorption and normal bowel function.
<BR>
<P>A 1998 German study examined deficiencies of vitamins and trace elements
<BR>
in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The records from 392
<BR>
outpatients-279 with Crohn's disease and 113 with ulcerative colitis-were
<BR>
analyzed. Deficiencies were found in 85% of patients with Crohn's disease,
<BR>
predominantly deficiencies of iron and calcium. Less frequently,
<BR>
deficiencies of zinc, protein, cyanocobalamin, and folic acid were found.
<BR>
Given this broad cross section of deficiencies, a basic multivitamin
<BR>
nutrient supplement may be helpful to stave off secondary weakness and
<BR>
complications from such deficiencies. Note that calcium deficiency, in
<BR>
particular, carries with it a risk of osteoporosis.
<BR>
<P>A published Scandinavian study suggests that fiber, starches, glutamine,
<BR>
and fish oils may all help Crohn's patients with issues of malnutrition.

<P>PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
<BR>
L-glutamine
<BR>
<P>L-glutamine is an amino acid which can be used for energy in the brain. It
<BR>
is recommended for alcoholism, hypoglycemia and fatigue. L-glutamine is
<BR>
used by athletes to improve exercise endurance.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2861/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html">http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=2861/sgroup_id=699/welcome.html</A>
<BR>
<P>For more information about glutamine see Life Extension Magazine September
<BR>
1999:
<BR>
&quot;Glutamine:  The essential nonessential amino acid&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Glutamine is classified as a &quot;nonessential amino acid.&quot; This label may
<BR>
mislead some people into believing that we don't need it. But, in essence,
<BR>
&quot;nonessential&quot; means only that the body can synthesize this amino acid. It
<BR>
does not mean &quot;unimportant.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In fact, glutamine is of crucial importance; we are lucky that we do not
<BR>
have to depend totally on dietary sources. It seems that every cell in the
<BR>
body uses glutamine. Some tissue types, however, depend on glutamine much
<BR>
more than others.
