<P>Don't feel so bad, Spike...

<P>I looked around some, and found a short history of the Atlas test program 
<BR>
at the Federation of American Scientists:

<BR>
<P>It is narrative, so I had to do some counting on the fingers. Of the first
<BR>
first *36* (and there were even more tests later) Atlas test flights, 13
<BR>
&quot;failed to meet test objectives&quot;. Two of the first 3 flights ended in
<BR>
fireballs.  They didn't even *try* a full range test of the complete
<BR>
system (warhead and all) until the *21st* flight.  The first 3 complete
<BR>
system tests exploded within 3 minutes of launch.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.ilslaunch.com/ILS/launch_services/history/Atlas_Operational.html">http://www.ilslaunch.com/ILS/launch_services/history/Atlas_Operational.html</A>
<BR>
<P>lists later test flights.  They include, in late 1962, a series of *6*
<BR>
consecutive failures *after the missile had been operationally deployed*. 
<BR>
<P>Yet this same missile was our first &quot;invincible weapon&quot;, deactivated only
<BR>
because it did not use storable propellants, carried 5 Mercury astronauts
<BR>
to orbit, and descendants of which are to this day carrying satellites
<BR>
into orbit. 
<BR>
<P>And we are moaning after 3 tests.  Get a grip... As I said before, only
<BR>
after as many test flights as it took to develope ICBMs to begin with
<BR>
would I be willing to declare defense a success *or* a failure.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Failure is not an option&quot;...damn right, it's a *requirement* if you are
<BR>
trying to do something truly new. Seems people are forgetting this more
<BR>
and more these days.  Sigh...
