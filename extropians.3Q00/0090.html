<P><EM>&gt; So.  Mooses.  Males with antlers, females without.  Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think evolution, and Moose precursors where antlers were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just beginning to develop.  The femooses are neutral to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them at first, but the antlers turn out to be good for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fighting and the moose with the bigger antlers wins.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nowthen, even if the femooses dont care, over time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the big antlered males win the fights.  The fight winners
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a big shot of testosterone, where the losers get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shot of anti-testosterone.  {Guys, you know what Im
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking about here}.  So even if the femooses are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indifferent to who won the fight, the winner wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to mate, perhaps several times, whereas the loser
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isnt really in the mood too much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nowthen, the group of femooses still must *accept* the big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antlered fight winner, right?  The femooses that prefer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the small antlered loser and go off with him will be less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to be mounted, since he isnt in the mood, whereas
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those who prefer the big antlered winner will spend the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evening with a horny moose. Result: Mr. Big Antlers sires
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more...meese.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; They take after their mother, and soon you have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population of mooses that inherently prefer big antlers,
</EM><BR>
<P>This where I have a problem with &quot;evolutionary psychology&quot;;
<BR>
&quot;big antlers&quot; is no simple thing, &quot;big antlers&quot; is about as
<BR>
abstract as concepts get.  You have to ask yourself how the
<BR>
process of storing abstract concepts like &quot;big antlers&quot; in
<BR>
DNA came about, *especially* when it has to weave that into
<BR>
something as complex as the brain.  Now, I'm not sure
<BR>
exactly how complex DNA is, but I'm doubtful that it encodes
<BR>
the brain to a degree that you could put &quot;big antlers&quot; in
<BR>
there.  Personally I doubt that much (if any) sex selection
<BR>
is happening at that level.
