<EM>&gt; &gt; Please, napster fans, how do we motivate people to do things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; like writing The Spike if their blood, sweat and tears can so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; easily be copied free?  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Spike:
<BR>
<P>In addition to the evidence adduced by Eliezer, I would like to add
<BR>
the complete works of Shakespeare.  Under your hypothesis he could
<BR>
never have written his works or they couldn't be very good.  After all
<BR>
he had no way to prohibit others, even his direct competitors -- bear
<BR>
in mind he was a businessman managing a troop of actors -- from
<BR>
putting on his plays, reprinting them and selling them.  There was no
<BR>
copyright in his day.
<BR>
<P>Another example would be the vast majority of the software that the
<BR>
BSD, GNU, and Linux contributors have written.  Indeed, how were those
<BR>
people ever motivated to do things like writing gcc if their blood,
<BR>
sweat and tears could so easily be copied free?
<BR>
<P>I think a little meditation on this question -- abandoning
<BR>
preconceptions for some honest, intense thought in search of an answer
<BR>
-- might change your thinking.  Your argument is not supported by the
<BR>
historical evidence; therefore there must be an error in your
<BR>
assumptions or your logic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; How much thought do you put into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your extropian posts?  Very little if you are anything like me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually I think very carefully about anything I introduce to public
<BR>
scrutiny.  I don't want to be embarrassed by being caught in a logical
<BR>
error, or even a grammatical or spelling error.  I must admit that I
<BR>
find quite a lot of dross in the public domain sources I read, but I'm
<BR>
often delighted by evidence of keen minds at work on the other end of
<BR>
the communication.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Would you want books that were no higher quality than what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we read on our chat groups?  Have any of you chat groups
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that are *not* brainy ones like extropians?  I do: a motorcycle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; enthusiasts group.  The writing there is so poor and the thoughts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so shallow it is scarcely worth the effort to hit the delete key on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most of them.  Is our literary future to be like that?  Napster fans?
