Linda Chamberlain in an Alcor release stated:
<BR>
New surgical techniques being pioneered at Alcor were used for the first time in the cryoprotection operation for FM-2030.  These resulted in vastly improved cryoprotection for this long-time supporter of the cryostasis process as a potentially life saving, though still experimental, technique.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I am so happy and relieved to learn FM received the latest advancements at Alcor!  Did this include the new revolutionary X-1000 ice blocker?  
<BR>
<P>It sounds like FM's odds of success in reanimation are going to be better than anyone who has ever gone before.  He may be among us sooner than I thought.
<BR>
<P>I have been fascinated in my readings about him in the mass media.  What a fascinatiing life he lead!  FM was truly a man of not a nation, but the whole world.
<BR>
<P>I hope eventually I can buy his books and view audio and video taken from his lectures.  I have heard FM could really challenge and inspire an audience.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
<BR>
