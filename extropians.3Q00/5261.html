<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think a female should be forced to get pregnant. Anything else that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; happens is a result of either consensus decisions between her and the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; involved, or a negotiated settlement or ruling enforced by courts if complete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consensus is not reached prior to conception. Note that while two people may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consensual about having sex, they very likely have not reached a consensus about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what to do for the next 18 years if she gets pregnant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you believe birth control is wholly effective?  No?  Do you believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that human beings have a strong enough urge for sex that they very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nearly must have sexual activity to stay sane for part of their lives?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe yes?  Then it is obvious that women cannot fully claim to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chosen to get pregnant every time they do.
</EM><BR>
<P>No more and no less so than the male who is 'irresponsible'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Males, in case you haven't noticed, are much more irresponsible, er
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; driven to have sex as often as possible and with less consideration of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences (as a gender based generality) than females.  A male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doesn't have to stick around to bear any consequences and it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ludricrous to claim that he generally has as much say in whether the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; woman decides to abort as she does.  Especially if there is no binding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contract between them.
</EM><BR>
<P>If there is no binding contract, then it should be a two way street. The concept
<BR>
of equal protection applies. If the woman has the right to choose to bind the
<BR>
male into an 18 year indenturment for the support of the child, then the male
<BR>
should have the same legal right to indenture the female.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Sure, but a pregancy does not involve just one body. You are dealing, in fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with three bodies (at a minimum), and any woman so callous as to totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; disregard the rights and concerns of the other two very likely would be a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; poor candidate for motherhood anyways, not to mention for being human, but of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; course, there is a matter of context/circumstances, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All three bodies do not have equal stakes and one of those bodies is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even a person but a fetus.  So what is it with this wierd position?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Callous my ass.  Carry around a fetal parasite within you that you never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanted at the insistent of people who claim the right to pressure you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do so and then tell me all these other people and psuedo-people have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; same right and stake.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, with the woman, its merely a matter of 9 months of discomfort and some
<BR>
medical risk. With the fetus, its a matter of life and death, literally, and
<BR>
with the male its a matter of 18 years of unconsented indenturement. Any claim
<BR>
that the stakes for the mother are greater than the stakes for the fetus is, at
<BR>
its core, its own proof of selfishness and callousness. Any claim that 18 years
<BR>
of financial indenturement is a miniscule violation of one's rights is also its
<BR>
own proof of selfishness and callousness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As a female, would you terminate an untimely pregnancy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Since I'm not, I don't have to worry about that, as a female. As a male, I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; already once been through an experience where a girlfriend got pregnant, did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; tell me, went off and got an abortion, and I did not hear about it for a couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years from a third party. We broke up before I found out, for likely the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reasons she got the abortion: She was an extremely selfish, self-centerd,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; materialistic woman. When I later found out what she did, I cannot say I was at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; all surprised, though I was rather bothered by what she did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the self-centeredness selfishness goes two ways.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so, and since you don't know anything about that particular
<BR>
relationship of mine, your comments are unfounded and merely ad homenim.
