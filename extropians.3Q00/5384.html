<P><EM>&gt;Godhood implies perfection, and requires all these absolute abilities;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;immortality, omnipotence, omniscience, are good examples.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Really, though, we can never be immortal, omnipotent, or omniscient. We can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;live a long time (1000s of years?), we can have much more power over the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;universe (moving stellar bodies around), we can know a lot of things
</EM><BR>
(what's
<BR>
<EM>&gt;going on at the atomic level in a star on the other side of the galaxy).
</EM><BR>
But
<BR>
<EM>&gt;we are fundamentally limited, and always will be.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, definitions matter, and mine are not wholly congruent with yours. As
<BR>
you go on to say (below), the Olympian Gods whom I mentioned as beings we
<BR>
could become like, are not &quot;perfect.&quot; But such beings are immensely powerful
<BR>
and long-lived and possessors of vast knowledge. Potentially, each could
<BR>
have a universe in which his or her power and life and knowledge would be
<BR>
absolute. (Sharing the same universe necessarily limits them to
<BR>
less-than-absolute levels of power.)
<BR>
<P>I would argue, it is not inconceivable that even such levels of being can be
<BR>
improved upon within our universe, or in another one just next door. Merely
<BR>
being long-lived could be turned into true immortality. Vast knowledge could
<BR>
increase into global, comprehensive knowledge. And immense power in our
<BR>
universe might translate into absolute power in a universe we spawned by
<BR>
compressing 20 kilograms of matter and popping out into a new space-time.
<BR>
(Which, of course, would require technologies we have not developed. Yet.)
<BR>
<P>It seems to me that there is no need to presume, as you do from the start,
<BR>
that there are limits to what we can do and what we can be. I say that we
<BR>
should aim as high as we can imagine and then see how far we can actually
<BR>
go.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;If I remember the stories about Olympus correctly, the inhabitants
</EM><BR>
exhibited
<BR>
<EM>&gt;decidedly mortal character flaws, although perhaps in godly proportion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly, there was a rather large helping of arrogance, and an uncommonly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;large amount of smiting going on. Kind of like Melrose Place with nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weapons. No thanks.
</EM><BR>
<P>Kind of like the world we inhabit now. But with more knowledge, more
<BR>
partying, and -- if you get beyond Homer and read other tales of the
<BR>
Olympians -- more acts of compassion toward lesser beings.
<BR>
<P>You may not like the world we have now, Emlyn, or the one we are building.
<BR>
But likes and dislikes won't change a thing. Only actions matter. So tell me
<BR>
what you propose, and what you oppose. Does only life-extension suit you?
<BR>
Would you oppose true immortality? The same questions apply to the godly
<BR>
levels of power and knowledge. Would you want or permit others to have such?
<BR>
Or are you simply unwilling to consider a really unbounded future?
<BR>
