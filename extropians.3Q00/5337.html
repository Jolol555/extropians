<P>&lt;&lt; As for the Nazis, yeah, they are no longer around as a nation, but this is
<BR>
&nbsp;after six years of war, millions of people killed and turning Europe into
<BR>
&nbsp;rubble, then into two armed camps (NATO and the Soviets).  If this is God
<BR>
&nbsp;answering prayers for the Jews and others truly decimated (how many people
<BR>
&nbsp;survived the camps versus the number who didn't?), I'd hate to see what
<BR>
&nbsp;happens when he doesn't answer prayers!  Does the Earth fall into the Sun?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Also, while Israel does exist, its prosperity is mostly the result of US
<BR>
&nbsp;funding.  If that's prayers being answered, then I guess every person on
<BR>
&nbsp;welfare -- including big corporations like AMD and some African dictators --
<BR>
&nbsp;should get down on their knees and praise the Lord.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Of course, I know Zero is only talking about this reinforcing a meme...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Cheers! &gt;&gt;

Now we have to find agreement on your contention that if God exists, God acts 
<BR>
through history?  Can you state what criteria would prove of falsify the 
<BR>
existence of God? Also, if God exists, is it of practical use to you, 
<BR>
personally? One of the nazis, questions, according to some survivors, when 
<BR>
the nazis were performing executions at ditches, and so-forth, was &quot;where is 
<BR>
your God now?&quot;  Presumably, most of the murderers were not-atheists (tho' 
<BR>
some probably were) most were nominal Christians, who beloned to either the 
<BR>
German Lutheran Church, or were Roman Catholics.
