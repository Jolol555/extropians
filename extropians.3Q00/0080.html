<EM>&gt;Gee, nobody ever told me *any* good stories like this when I lived there.

I think that the smart people had this strange tendancy to leave... ;)

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What was the name of that big family entertainment center up North of

<EM>&gt; &gt; Armuchee?  With the big swimming pool, lake, horseback rides, etc.?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Never heard of it.  Whenever I asked anyone there about entertainment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;possibilites, they tried to get me to join their church.  Evidently, I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;asking the wrong people.  Or they have gotten *very* good over the years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at maintaining their cover...

I recall spending some of the most miserable time in my life at one of those 
<BR>
churches - 2nd Avenue Baptist - especially during &quot;Vacation&quot; Bible School, 
<BR>
which is where the parents who were not happy with having their kids 
<BR>
underfoot dumped them.  The fat, stupid, mean young women who ran these 
<BR>
prisons for kids would have gone straight to their rightful reward in their 
<BR>
equally boring hereafter, if I'd had anything to say about it.  Then there 
<BR>
was Sunday School, where the guys told racist jokes and talked football for 
<BR>
45 minutes and spent fifteen minute piously trying not to fall asleep as the 
<BR>
adult read the days' lesson.  (If you didn't long for life after death 
<BR>
there, then where were you supposed to find it?)  Then you went to the 
<BR>
actual church service, where they laid this incredible guilt trip on you - 
<BR>
You're goin to HELL! ifin you don't walk up that there aisle raht nauw and 
<BR>
confess Jesus Christ as your lord and savior!  Gack, let me gag for a second 
<BR>
in remembrance...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Say, where did all the black people live?  I was shocked when I discovered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that Floyd County was 40 % black because I never *saw* them.  I thought it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was creepy that they could stay so well hidden, and even creepier that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they would find it...convenient.

I didn't see that many black people when I was there either.  They were 
<BR>
pretty effectively segregated by the default that the banks wouldn't lend to 
<BR>
them, and the real estate people wouldn't sell them property, or rent a 
<BR>
decent house to them.  So they lived often in barely renovated chicken 
<BR>
coops, with a dinged up Cadillac on the lawn - or dirt, more likely - and a 
<BR>
TV antenna.  This life style was then taken as proof of their 
<BR>
incorrigibility.
<BR>
<P>My grandfather from Vermont, a crusty, fearless old Vermont farmer with a 
<BR>
damned good education and a sharp sense of humor used to visit for months 
<BR>
and go out picking cotton just for the exercise.  The only other cotton 
<BR>
pickers were black.  As he and my grandmother would be returning from the 
<BR>
fields, together with the black workers, he noted that a bunch of white guys 
<BR>
would be leaning up against the sheds, sucking on straws and chewing 
<BR>
tabacco.  They would be making comments in passing about &quot;them lazy, 
<BR>
shiftless nigras.&quot;
