<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; there's nothing stopping people here from buying insurance and getting

<EM>&gt; &gt;except perhaps that they've already been taxed for

<EM>&gt; &gt;as much money as they can afford to support the less responsive

<EM>&gt;There's a 30 percent rebate on the health tax component (which is a bit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;over 1 percent of tax levied, as I recall, a pretty good investment in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;social utility in my view) to those taking out private insurance. And as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mentioned, quite often people with insurance are treated by public

<EM>&gt;hospitals anyway, where specialised equipment and expertise have been

<EM>&gt;purchased at communal expense.

<P>Has it occured to you that public health care works in the same way as the 
<BR>
Soviet centralized production system? It didn't work there, why should it 
<BR>
work elsewhere?
<BR>
It works in other countries since we have an unhealthy mix of socialism and 
<BR>
capitalism (in various degrees), and the private sector is productive so 
<BR>
that the public can continue to exist, pumping new funds into it.
<BR>
<P>Now imagine the health care sector liberated from its GOSPLAN mentality. 
<BR>
That's really transhumanism.
