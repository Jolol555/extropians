<EM>&gt; &gt; One possible solution is being pursued directly by SIAI- jump past the

<EM>&gt; &gt; nanotech stage directly to superhuman intelligence. Vote with your donation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dollars, but I feel this is a better approach than trying to develop what

<EM>&gt; &gt; will likely be ineffective means of nanotech/biowar defense. Actually I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; donate to both Foresight and SIAI... hedging my bets I guess.

<P>Eli, you have to understand how to play the game. Explain to the sister
<BR>
that you are involved in, PRAISE THE LORD, research into the true
<BR>
ultimate and final purpose of the human race, and its purpose in the
<BR>
Grand Scheme of Things. That yours is a lay organization doing the Good
<BR>
Work of the Great Architect among the imperfect souls of the earth,
<BR>
preparing man for the End of Dayz....  I'm sure they would be quite
<BR>
happy to help you out with the paperwork. Be sure to show up at their
<BR>
office with a fish pin on your collar....

<P>&quot;In the end more than they wanted freedom, they wanted security. When
the
Athenians finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give
to
them, when the freedom they wished for was freedom from responsibility,
then
Athens ceased to be free.&quot;  --- Edward Gibbon (1737-1794)
<P>&quot;A person who wants a society that is both safe and free, wants what
never 
has been, and what never will be.&quot;  --- Thomas Jefferson
<P>&quot;It's a Republic, if you can keep it...&quot; --- Benjamin Franklin
