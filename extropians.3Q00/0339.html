Do you think such people actually mean that they appreciate not only the
<BR>
beauty or whatever, but the mystery (for them) of how it got that way?
<BR>
In other words, most of these &quot;spiritual&quot; people are simply looking for
<BR>
a nice way of saying that they enjoy being ignorant?

<EM>&gt; What is the difference between being &quot;spiritually&quot; inclined and just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having a grand appreciation for your life and the reality you currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inhabit? Many people I've talked to often claim a sense of spirituality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without belief in some higher Creator/Supreme Being. Upon probing, what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've found is simply that they appreciate the complexity and the beauty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of their environment (internal and external) without reference to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all-powerful deity. So, my question would then be, why use the loaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; term spiritual, when really, you mean simple appreciation for your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances (whatever you perceive/believe them to be)?

<EM>&gt; &gt; You might clarify this by explaining why you unnecessarily conjoin belief in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a spiritual reality with a belief in god, as one could have a belief in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; spiritual reality without believing in god (I do)
