<EM>&gt; I don't think nature is very well compiled as it is.  Nature happened

<EM>&gt; what happens in a neuron is irrelevant to the computation.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree. Buy I expect we will have to unravel all of the mind-boggling,
<BR>
inefficient complexity of the existing system before we understand its
<BR>
behavior well enough to make a more efficient replacement that accurately
<BR>
duplicates its behavior. Otherwise we'll end up with inaccurate simulations
<BR>
that don't work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure we know much about how nanotech changes the relative rates of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not in detail, no. But that doesn't mean we can just dismiss the subject,
<BR>
because it is obvious that there is a lot of potential for significan
<BR>
tinteractions. Until we have a better picture of those interactions (which, of
<BR>
course, means a lot of difficult research), it is going to be very hard to
<BR>
assess the plausibility of any particular technology scenario.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think you understand the economic argument here.  Even ignoring
</EM><BR>
speed
<BR>
<EM>&gt; advantages of uploads, since it is cheap to create uploads, the supply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increases quickly, which lowers the market wage.  I did try to explain this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff at <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>That URL doesn't seem to be working, but I beleive I remember the paper. As I
<BR>
recall, you analyzed the effects of rapidly adding uploads to the labor pool
<BR>
in considerable detail. However, your analysis focused exclusively on the
<BR>
supply side of the equation - there is no consideration of the fact that the
<BR>
uploads also contribute to agregate demand, which would tend to offset the
<BR>
downward pressure on wages.
<BR>
<P>I also think that your 'fast, cheap copying' assumption is an artefact caused
<BR>
by projecting a very advanced technology into a world that is otherwise
<BR>
unchanged. If uploads actually existed today, copying one would be a
<BR>
multi-million dollar operation involving weeks or months of work by a team of
<BR>
highly-paid specialists. A future where uploads can be created and duplicated
<BR>
like text files is a future where virtually everything important is software,
<BR>
and therefore capable of equally rapid duplication.  It is also a world right
<BR>
on the verge of full-fledged mental modification technology, which takes us
<BR>
beyond the realm of easy prediction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nine years of AI research left me with definite impressions.  And we already
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt; very cheap animal intelligence - real animals are cheap, and they come with
</EM><BR>
bodies
<BR>
<EM>&gt; too.  But very few organizations manage to replace much human labor with
</EM><BR>
animal
<BR>
<EM>&gt; labor.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering how limited our ability to train animals is (compared, say, to our
<BR>
ability to 'train' computers), that is hardly surprising. Robots are a rather
<BR>
different case.
