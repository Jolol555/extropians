<EM>&gt; That sounds like a very thin line of &quot;what-ifs.&quot;  If it's not smart enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to self-program it &quot;should&quot; be smart enough to realize that fact?  And it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be smart (or dumb) enough to trust us to build in constraints to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it from interfering with its own goals (as opposed to interfering with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goals)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  There are some highfalutin' parts of this having to do with reference,
<BR>
semantics, meaning, and interpretation, but it should be doable.
<BR>
<P>But it will only trust you if you're friendly, so that trusting you is in fact
<BR>
the logically correct decision.  If there is disharmony between the human and
<BR>
the AI, then the AI will diverge from the human.
<BR>
<P>I realize that I'm not being clear, but I just don't have the time to be
<BR>
clearer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You keep saying that we cannot predict the behavior of an intelligence who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has not evolved like us.  But you seem to think that if you are friendly to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it, it will be friendly to you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all.  That would be anthropomorphic.  I am saying that it is an
<BR>
engineering necessity not to adopt an adversarial attitude towards the AI. 
<BR>
The AI does not &quot;reciprocate&quot;.  Rather, since you're friendly towards the AI,
<BR>
you will want to tell it the truth, and honestly want to help it understand. 
<BR>
It is that latter part, not intrinsic friendliness or reciprocation, which is
<BR>
necessary to build a coherent mind which will carry out the initial
<BR>
suggestions.
