Sounds good to me. After you fork (keeping a backup copy until you ack
<BR>
arrival in good shape at the other end) you should be able to cover
<BR>
interstellar-neighbour hops directly with 0.95 c, or so, if using a
<BR>
(redundant cloud of, lest you meet a dust grain in transit) gray sail
<BR>
(made of, say, lightweight carbon truss cloth, operates at 2000 K)
<BR>
probes driven by a circumsolar microwave phased array, and express you
<BR>
(stored as lattice defects in a crystal, of a self-repairing (because
<BR>
of radiation background) molecular memory) upon arrival. If you travel
<BR>
as a cloud, you can distribute redundancy over other nodes in transit,
<BR>
reducing probability of losing bits of you. Decceleration is done by
<BR>
the usual detachable double sail trick. Subjective travel time: zero,
<BR>
unless you insist to travel at full clock (a few subjective megayears
<BR>
in transit, unless you hug c *real* close). Of course, then you will
<BR>
have to wait a little before you can travel to the next star, until
<BR>
you construct the abovementioned star-pumped radiation source. After
<BR>
that setup time, subsequent travels can occur either as photons
<BR>
(bandwidth imo way too low), as routable matter packets (a kind of
<BR>
interstellar TCP/IP) or verbatim (gray sail probe), without further
<BR>
decceleration.
<BR>
<P>A sequence of such launchers could bring a relatively macroscopic
<BR>
probe (containing antimater fuel for decceleration) to high fraction
<BR>
of c, allowing speedy (single-hop) intergalactic travel.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I'm not sure beings will at all want to travel. It sure reduces
<BR>
interaction latency talking to the guys at the other end in person,
<BR>
but the complexity of the travelling critter is necessarily limited
<BR>
(if you occupy cubic miles of nanocircuits, you're pretty immobile),
<BR>
and the target culture will be very different. As will be the culture
<BR>
you depart from, by the time you come back.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 2)	Develop a self-extracting signal able to interface with some plentiful
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; natural condition - 
</EM><BR>
<P>Good idea, but I have not the foggiest on how to do this. Don't think
<BR>
it can be done with photons, unless there's someone smart at the other 
<BR>
end already.
