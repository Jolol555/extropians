Being an Alaskan I have found this thread interesting.  The discussion of 
<BR>
the problems with interceptor missle accuracy made me think of the old 
<BR>
Soviet answer to the problem which was to simply arm the defensive missle 
<BR>
with a NUCLEAR warhead which would detonate as it got near the enemy 
<BR>
missle!!  You don't need dead-on accuracy if a nuke is used!! lol  If I 
<BR>
remember correctly the NATO term for the system was &quot;Golosh.&quot;  I read the 
<BR>
Russians built a string of bunkers around Moscow which could repeatedly 
<BR>
launch these missles in a probably vain attempt at stopping hundreds of 
<BR>
incoming western missles from destroying the city.  At least they addressed 
<BR>
the issue and did the best they could with the technology available to them.
