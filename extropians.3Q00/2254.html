<EM>&gt;   I have no respect for oppressive Muslim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; fundamentalists or tribalists that perform female genital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; mutilation, and I have no respect for the cultures that engender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; such behavior.  As Nadia points out, respect for the purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; aesthetic traditions of a culture is one thing -- one can't condemn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; people for preferring one set of culturally pervasive tonalities in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; music over another, for instance.  But a cultural preference for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; brutality is quite another thing.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This is right, but only because I think so.  ;)

Actually no, it't not because we think so, it's because we feel so. You are 
<BR>
more tuned in to empathy than their torturers, who feel GOOD while they do 
<BR>
it. For whatever justification.  Hey - And the victims most likely agree with 
<BR>
you, but power has gotten out so of their hand until they have no voice. No 
<BR>
voice.. and no choice...  
<BR>
<P>Just saying our culture values choice ignoress the CONTEXT - our hard earned 
<BR>
other cultural value: The vast importance in our culture has placed on free 
<BR>
education. Oh. And separation of church and state, and a few basic 
<BR>
constitutional rights we take so for granted. 
<BR>
<P>With lots of information to choose from, people will make much better 
<BR>
choices. With little or none, they will not even perceive that they have any. 
<BR>
There is much literature and art devoted to this topic.
<BR>
<P>(IMO To say our culture values choice is only referring to a certain segment 
<BR>
of economic means and knowledge, BTW)
<BR>
<P>Terms liek post-modernism and modernism are masturbations. Getting out at 
<BR>
educating people is more productive.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;Information wants to be free&quot; quote has little to do with bandwidth 
<BR>
forgery of rock music. What it really meant back in the day was that 
<BR>
censorship and forced enslavery of wills was *never* going to happen because 
<BR>
of underground movements and the free press: thru freedom of speech and self 
<BR>
education. The Internet was seen as a gateway to untold resources of 
<BR>
variables. Including cultural ones.
<BR>
<P>Yet still the R.O.W. (rest of th world) is not hoooked in.
<BR>
<P>Now I am beginning to see it as a place for arm-chair psychology and couch 
<BR>
philosophy.
