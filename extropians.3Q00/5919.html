<EM>&gt; Historical studies suggest strongly that many industrialist funded the nazis in the 1920's to off-set gains by the commies and the social democrats. I shan't shed a tear for the poor capitalists, who contributed to the Hitler Fund. Graft was already a feature of Bismarckian Germany for 50 years since its inception in 1866. These guys knew who they were funding. Also the nazis were heavilly into business in the reich-such as running everything from machine works to brothels.

<P>Just because they donated to his campaigns does not make him a capitalist. As
<BR>
shown in elections here, business people frequently donate to both sides to have
<BR>
an in no matter which party wins the election.
<BR>
<P>The commies had very little support outside of unions and the intelligentsia,
<BR>
and it is likely that industrialsts supported the Nazis as a lesser evil. Keep
<BR>
in mind that the german aristocracy was anti-semitic for centuries, and the
<BR>
german communist party was populated by a largely disproportionate amount by
<BR>
jews, and most industrialists from the WWI era had large amounts of debts to the
<BR>
german branch of the Rothchilds family, which under the poor economic conditions
<BR>
of german was likely a heavy burden for any industry trying to retool after WWI.
