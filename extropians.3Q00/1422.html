<EM>&gt; &gt; Would you consider the environment/surroundings as an 'entity'?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Ah. Well, I thought I would ask, because if you were a believer in Gaea
<BR>
Theory, then your use of the word spiritual to mean a 'connection' with
<BR>
that entity, I would capitulate and agree your usage is appropriate.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you could elaborate on your use of connection?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe it would be better to say a cause and effect link rather than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; connection. I need to think about this a while, and I'll try to remember to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come back to this question again if I come up with a better answer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Cause and effect link? Hmmm. I'm trying to see what you mean by this
<BR>
given the example you posted a while back. When you released the coyote,
<BR>
that was the cause which generated the effect of being able to commune
<BR>
with it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I'm perfectly willing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accept an explanation that simply involves an ineffable feeling that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there is something binding you and the perceived.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Interesting. Why not? However, let me clarify this statement a bit. I'm
<BR>
willing, in general, to accept others' &quot;I just have this feeling. I
<BR>
can't describe it, but there is definitely something there.&quot;. I may
<BR>
question to explore further, but there seems little point in getting
<BR>
someone to describe something that they have just said they can not.
<BR>
This doesn't mean that the issue can not be revisited, but I'm for
<BR>
moving on when current avenues appear to be failing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I don't think anyone was denying the phenomena exist. At least for me, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; was questioning the appropriate usage of the word when it seems others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are available that do a better job at representing what you are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; experiencing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I now agree with you that &quot;spiritual&quot; is not a good word to use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately, I'm not sure what to use in its place to describe that aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of consciousness which is not included in the generally aceepted scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition.  What other words would you use?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Well, it's kind of funny you ask that. I would most likely use the word
<BR>
'numinous' or 'commune'. It's funny because one of the definitions for
<BR>
numinous is holy; the same connotation I wish to avoid with spiritual.
<BR>
However, I might argue that usage of the word numinous is uncommon
<BR>
enough that religious baggage is no longer attached (i.e., forgotten or
<BR>
just not known). Also, one of the definitions is an appeal to higher
<BR>
emotions or an aesthetic sense, which definitely gets across the feeling
<BR>
I believe you are describing.
