<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Transparency works with IP, not against it.  Yes, you can watch David
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Brin write his next novel as it's being written.  But the police can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; see you performing an illegal observation, and arrest you for watching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; him.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sorry, but: if there are such things as illegal observations, then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fail to have 100% transparency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not at all.  There could be 100% transparency in fact, but making use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this transparency could nontheless be made illegal.  (Brin, to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best of my knowledge, has never said otherwise.)  Think of it as an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all-seeing society with its eyes taped shut.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok...you've lost me.  If an entity has its eyes (and other visual
<BR>
sensors) disabled, then by definition it can't see anything at that
<BR>
time, no matter how much it might otherwise see.  So it isn't
<BR>
all-seeing, at least not until it un-blinds itself.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (Who wants some pervert watching your every move?)
</EM><BR>
<P>That being part of the point of full transparency, or at least one of
<BR>
its possible consequences.  (Though, unless you put out sex shows or
<BR>
somesuch day in and day out, no matter which gender you are, most people
<BR>
probably won't bother to spend their attention on you 24/7.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; From the rest of your post, it seems that you agree - except that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not, techncially, transparency, since transparency goes both ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Be careful to keep the distinction between &quot;cheap ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surveilance technology&quot; and the society David Brin describes clear.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Transparency is merely the former.  Transparency is not necessarily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; David Brin's utopia.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, we disagree on definitions of the word, then.  (I believe that
<BR>
transparency does not mean the presence of CUST without the possibility
<BR>
of its use, and indeed CUST can not be CUST if it is made illegal: if
<BR>
UST is forbidden with any kind of effective enforcement, then - to the
<BR>
person on the street - it is, by definition, not cheaply available.
<BR>
Breaking a well-enforced law usually incurs significant costs.)
