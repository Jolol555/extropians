<P>&lt;&lt; Okay, so nothing anyone can say will change your mind about free markets 
<BR>
-- you
<BR>
&nbsp;just don't like them and blame most of the world's problems on capital. Of
<BR>
&nbsp;course you must know that whatever alternatives to free markets have been 
<BR>
tried
<BR>
&nbsp;have never ended in sugar coatings. What alternatives to capital have you 
<BR>
tried?

No-you have that wrong, intensely wrong.  I am a supporter of free enterprise 
<BR>
capitalism. But I am also a pragmatist-within limits. Hypothetically 
<BR>
capitalism shold be adaptable and self correcting. I am concerned that this 
<BR>
might not be true under all circumstances. Secondly, painting Hitler as 
<BR>
merely some kind of socialist, is also incorrect. He and the nazis operated 
<BR>
in a capitalist manner, especially that of earlier centuries. Reminder, 
<BR>
capitalists have engaged in mass murder in the pursuit of low cost labor 
<BR>
(slavery) to plant, and harvest, tobacco and cotton in the Americas. 
<BR>
Capitalists in Europe absorbed Jewish business (to reduce competition) and 
<BR>
thus increase their profits. Similarly, commies have engaged in mass murder 
<BR>
in their pursuit of socialism. I tend to side with the capitalists despite 
<BR>
their history, especially the free-enterprise kind. There are other kinds 
<BR>
such as OPEC cartels, and 
<BR>
corporate monopolies, mafia orgs, etc. The devil is in the details, but so is 
<BR>
the truth.
