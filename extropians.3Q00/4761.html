Wow, Ankara, it really sounds like you were living in a different city than
<BR>
I am.
<BR>
<P>Point in case:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You'll perhaps miss Vancouver's male to female ratio (something like 11:1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has given it a reputation as a 'bachelor's' paradise.
</EM><BR>
<P>11 males to 1 female?  What, were you in a bike gang or something?  Yikes.
<BR>
You seem to be consulting some interesting stats.  Actually, it's very close
<BR>
to 50/50.
<BR>
<P>A nice quote to liven up your day:
<BR>
<P>&quot;In March 1995, the Corporate Resources Group in Geneva, Switzerland,
<BR>
released a ranking of 118 major cities in the world based upon living and
<BR>
environmental conditions. The City of Vancouver won a silver medal as the
<BR>
second best city in the world. The City Administration ranked sixth for
<BR>
public service, efficiency and infrastructure. The top five cities were:
<BR>
Singapore, Auckland, Wellington, Vienna, and Dusseldorf. This placed
<BR>
Vancouver first in North America.
<BR>
<P>In December 1997, the same group rated Vancouver as the most livable major
<BR>
city in North America and the world. Auckland, was ranked 2nd, Toronto 3rd
<BR>
and Montreal 15th.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>For the record, I have yet to witness yellow haze, public suicides, rampant
<BR>
violence against women and children, and depressing crime-infested
<BR>
underwater twilights, although I'm certain that all of those things are
<BR>
happening somewhere.
<BR>
<P>One wonders why you stayed here for 11 years...?!
<BR>
<P><P>I think this is indication of another trait of big cities:  2 different
<BR>
people can have extremely different experiences of them.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I noticed a vast difference btwn Canadian, (esp West Coast Cdn) and US
</EM><BR>
(esp
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Californian) personal ethics and business practices - eg. the Vancouver
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stock exchange is an insider joke. My best adivce is to do business only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with enitites solid enough to sue.
</EM><BR>
<P>I happen to know several stock brokers in this city and they are among the
<BR>
finest people I know.  Honestly.  And they're *stock brokers*!
<BR>
<P>I *really* doubt there's an appreciable difference between the moral
<BR>
integrity of the business community of West Coast Canada and West Coast U.S.
<BR>
I know many who would disagree, but I'm not certain they'd be pointing
<BR>
north.
<BR>
<P><P>The fact of the matter is that, in general, Vancouver is a pretty damn nice
<BR>
place to be living on planet earth.  It's got ugly parts, I'll grant that.
<BR>
East Hastings is a nasty little heroin capital.  And L.A. has some big
<BR>
advantages as I've already noted.  In fact, I'd even go so far as to say
<BR>
that L.A. can -also- be a pretty damn nice place to be living on planet
<BR>
earth.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;I'm a -little- bit afraid of who I might become once I move there - I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;hoping to do &gt;some good fortification to my personality before I make the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;jump.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Care to share your tactics?
</EM><BR>
<P>#1) Focus on the work, not on the audience.
<BR>
<P>That's the big one.
