<EM> &gt; That explains my recent mental sluggishness a lot...I'm up to about 35,000 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; volumes.  Eugene spent &quot;several $100 just for shipping&quot; last time he moved; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Lucky you, I'm only in 2-3 k range. I stopped just in time ;)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I spent $700 or so just for the boxes to put the books in.  (After each move
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I keep the boxes for the next move; there's a 10-foot stack of flattened 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; boxes in a back room.)
</EM><BR>
<P>I left essentially all my library but the core 60 kg or so of my books 
<BR>
in a former pig sty in Bavaria the last time I moved. I hope the mice
<BR>
have not been too hungry for literature...
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; While there's definite utility to on-line storage -- grepping through 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; my library! -- paper still wins out for a lot of purposes.  
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Apparently, xpdf has a pdf2txt in it somewhere, allowing one to use
<BR>
htdig and consorts. I don't know what to do with .ps.gz, probably
<BR>
ps2txt should do. After I do a total reinstall of my Linux box (some
<BR>
new hardware to integrate) I'm seriously thinking about full-text
<BR>
indexing the entire /home's.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Chief is the hedonistic, materialistic pleasure of going downstairs and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; being surrounded by *my* *own* library.  (Okay, I'm shallow.  At least I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; own up to it.)
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I do like the smell and texture, but information is what counts. Imo
<BR>
the feel of a book is certainly abstractable from the presentation,
<BR>
though I insist on high quality fonts ;)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; OTOH, I had a flood last year, and lost 1000+ books.  OTOOH, I have 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; replacement cost insurance.  I figure I'll move on-line gradually,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; as the technology gets there.  Starting with journals, which are often
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; already available on-line but more expensive than my typical acquisition 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; costs.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I'm already purchasing my IT journals (c't, iX) with a (bi)annual
<BR>
CD-ROM with the full text in HTML, as the dead tree is virtually
<BR>
useless without a search function, and Science, luckily, allows one to 
<BR>
download all articles in .pdf. We definitely need a Science/Nature
<BR>
.pdf warez swap channel...
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I'm more eager to migrate the 3000 videotapes to digital format.  While
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; paper has some advantages over bits, tape has none.  VHS tapes make
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lossy copies, take up enormous space, have a short shelf-life, and there 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are no good storage solutions for large collections.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Then MPEG-4 is your friend. You can compress a DVD to ~0.6 GBytes, VHS
<BR>
with their lousy quality should take half that much. I think you
<BR>
should invest in some of the 70 GByte RAID, it is not all that
<BR>
expensive anymore. I would do it with soft RAID and Linux (because I'm
<BR>
cheap) and leave the box on the house network, when you migrate
<BR>
content (right now I do it with only drives -- not even with a
<BR>
true backup).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Basically, I'm an information junkie.  I would read 300+ newsgroups a day
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; if I had the time.  Even pruned to my bare minimum, I still get 1 MB of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; email a day.
</EM><BR>
<P>What? Just 1 MByte? ;)
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Extrapolating current trends, when I get to be a Jupiter-sized brain, I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; imagine I'll need a star cluster just to store all the crap I've 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; accumulated.  Not even counting my collection of Keith Hensons....  
</EM><BR>
<P>Will they measure up to my limited-edition Anders Sandbergs? ;)
