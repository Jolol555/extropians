<P>
Skipping past the earlier part of this thread, I'll just quote salient parts
<BR>
of Emlyn's recent reply in which he argues against any notion of
<BR>
Transhumanist godhood and for:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Promot[-ing] a culture of trust of each other, of individual humility
</EM><BR>
combined
<BR>
<EM>&gt;with a belief in the ability of humanity to rise above all challenges.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Promote rationality/rational thinking. Promote self reliance, and encourage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;self confidence in all people. Don't crap on other people.
</EM><BR>
<P>=&gt; I can certainly accept the desirability of that. However, I have noticed
<BR>
that the brightest and most talented people I know tend to be anything but
<BR>
humble. Unlike mediocrities (maybe including me!) about whom it can be said
<BR>
&quot;He has much to be humble about&quot; these folks really have achieved much to be
<BR>
proud of. I don't know how to make them become humble. Do you?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Humility is mostly about remembering that there is a slim chance that, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maybe, you might be the person who is wrong after all. Or maybe there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elements of truth on all sides. Or maybe everyone is entirely off the mark.
</EM><BR>
<P>=&gt; Right. But the lone genius who swims against the tide might also be right
<BR>
while everyone going with the flow is wrong. The only way such a maverick
<BR>
can maintain his or her strength of will in such circumstances is to have an
<BR>
unshakable confidence, even arrogance. There is no way to know in advance
<BR>
whether such a person is right or wrong. Many have been wrong. But the ones
<BR>
who were right have made disproportionately great contributions to the sum
<BR>
total of human knowledge and well-being. Should we elevate humility over
<BR>
genius?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Godhood, on the other hand, means never having to say you're sorry.
</EM><BR>
<P>=&gt; As does genius. Go figure!
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;However, I am unconvinced of the benefits of (following/striving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for/assuming the status of) gods in the future. The path we are taking is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decidedly secular; our technologies are not divine gifts, they are strictly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human creations. There is no sign that this will change any time soon (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any time at all!).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Striving for excellence is excellent. Where's the room for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spirituality/mysticism/religosity? Why do we need it? Does it benefit us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;add it? What price do we pay?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;=&gt; Those very secular technologies may result in godhood being thrust upon
<BR>
us. Consider an extension of Clarke's Law (&quot;Any sufficiently advanced
<BR>
technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot;) to cover the situation
<BR>
described in Vernor Vinge's fictional universe where some intelligent
<BR>
species Transcend their former state and become Powers with, yes, god-like
<BR>
power. Let the new Law state &quot;Any sufficiently advanced species is
<BR>
indistinguishable from gods.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it's not a matter of willfully imposing or importing religious ideas,
<BR>
but rather of discovering that they best correspond to the situation we will
<BR>
have brought about by our own human actions. And really, a god is only a god
<BR>
in front of the neighbors. Within the family of gods, everyone knows that he
<BR>
puts his galaxies on one leg at a time, just like everyone else.
<BR>
