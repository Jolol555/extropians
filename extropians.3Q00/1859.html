<EM>&gt; Nah.  I volunteered to have my prediction (a hit)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reposted with the traditional implied neeener neeener should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the shot go awry (as it did the two times before) but John
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clark was too much the gentleman to neener me.  {8^D

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually I think John and I have identical goals, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end war, but we just have a difference on how that goal is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be attained.  Fair enough: there are those who believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that peace can be attained thru a mighty room filled with men,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a paper they are signing says they'll never fight again.
</EM><BR>
<P>We've been here before. Remember we had already outlawed war, just a few
<BR>
years prior to WWII.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do not hold that opinion.  Perhaps I have a too-cynical view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of human nature, but all treaties are temporary solutions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Overwhelming technology is the way to permanent peace.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And it must be *truly* overwhelming, and Mike all of us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will pay a price for that peace.  You and I have had differing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; views on privacy: well, you know what all this anti-missile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tech eventually leads to, do you not?  As soon as we really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can defeat all incontinental missiles, we need to go after the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; next level of threat, which is smuggled suitcase WMDs, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we know where that line of reasoning leads, do we not?
</EM><BR>
<P>x-ray radar from satellites should do the trick of tracking all high
<BR>
density objects from suspicious sources.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually I have recently been entertaining a new notion,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that war can be ended by another, far more wonderful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; means: by choking off the profitability of it all.  Right now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few young people are going into military technology fields
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because mil-tech development pays considerably less than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; commercial counterpart.  There are no stock options,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no company furnished BMW, no IPOs, no chick-magnet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; T-shirts, no 25 year old  CEOs in lear jets.  Hell we dont really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even have company picnics.  Mil-tech aint sexy.  But I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far sooner achieve final world peace using the dollar rather than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using the missile.
</EM><BR>
<P>We've reached the late Empire stage of development, where we will likely
<BR>
need to hire 'barbarian' mercenaries from the frontier in order to keep
<BR>
the peace. Opening up immigration should also keep the supply of young
<BR>
macho ignoramuses (I can say it cause I was a domestically grown young
<BR>
macho ignoramus) for the military available. However, don't think making
<BR>
the manpower expensive will change things. We've done this before in
<BR>
Europe. Study up on the era of Condottiere Armies, where the european
<BR>
powers still fought their wars, but they were with small armies of
<BR>
professional soldiers / mercenaries, where unit commanders frequently
<BR>
owned all the equipment in their unit, and treated it like a business.
<BR>
Young men would join in order to avoid legal problems or family
<BR>
embarrassment, and in hopes for the chance for loot.
<BR>
<P>Then again, we could have a swarm of recruits available if the dot com
<BR>
craze goes south, with hundreds of thousands of out of shape guys and
<BR>
gals trying to avoid their creditors in the military, and getting back
<BR>
in shape thanks to boot camp...if you get sent overseas on military
<BR>
deployments, creditors are legally barred from seizing any of your
<BR>
assets.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem is, this is currently working against the U.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We need to figure out a way to make mil-tech less profitable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than commercial development in *other* countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is the problem, except creating that competition, and giving them
<BR>
the technology will only enable them to conduct hacker warfare on us in
<BR>
order to destabilize our economy (as we are seeing a few instances from
<BR>
the Phillipines, China, and Argentina.) Its the minds and hearts you
<BR>
need to change, Spike, which is the hard part.
