<EM>&gt; (sorry). If there were a few of us, we'd all be comitted (to each

</EM><BR>
<P>That sounds like a great idea - I'd love to see what you have in mind.
<BR>
Perhaps the first thing to do is get setup at sourceforge: That'll give
<BR>
you a place to start posting some ideas, and set up a couple of discussion
<BR>
lists to get some brainstorming going. If you're doing something exciting,
<BR>
I'd be interested in getting involved.
<BR>
<P>I've been interested, on and off, in some sort of distributed mud-like
<BR>
system. I'd like, for instance, to be able to walk through a door and
<BR>
seamlessly be talking to another server. Or manipulate objects whose
<BR>
behavior is being computed on another machine somewhere else. You'd figure
<BR>
out some system where by objects (a stove, a book, etc.) declare the ways
<BR>
in which they can be manipulated (open, close, read, etc.), along with
<BR>
verb mappings, then anyone can drop new objects in, run it's innards
<BR>
anywhere, and let people play with it. Some sort of Corba'ish/RMI deal.
