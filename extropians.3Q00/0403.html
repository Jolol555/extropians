<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;	Another thing Miller questioned was the assumption that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	Pleistocene women NEEDED defending by men. More likely they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	lived together in groups of several women with their kids.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	I've gotten in big trouble and been called a man-basher and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	worse for saying this, but the fact is that while I adore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	men as friends and lovers, I prefer women as house-mates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	For one thing, they don't try to own me. But the owning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	thing may be cultural rather than hard-wired.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would be interested to know if the &quot;owning&quot; is hardwired too!
<BR>
<P>Personally, I was not fond of the label &quot;wife&quot;, when I was married,
<BR>
because of all of the attached cultural baggage (neutral descriptions
<BR>
like &quot;spouse&quot; were fine).
<BR>
<P>On an issue like &quot;owning&quot;, I think it's many-layered, and one might
<BR>
want to try to separate the:
<BR>
<P>* hardwired aspect
<BR>
* personal preference aspect
<BR>
* cultural aspect
<BR>
* government aspect
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(if the two have a legal arrangement i.e. legal marriage)
<BR>
<P>and then see where the &quot;owning&quot; come from. I suspect the
<BR>
cultural aspect is very big.
<BR>
<P>It's hard to get past heavy cultural conditioning. Many younger
<BR>
girls (for example: teenage) are conditioned that one of their life
<BR>
goals &quot;should&quot; be to get married and raise a family. This
<BR>
conditioning could be (and often is) at odds with the goal of
<BR>
building a career. The conditioning can go deep for the girl too, in
<BR>
this way: &quot;I am not a whole person unless I have a husband.&quot; Or &quot;His
<BR>
career is more important than my career.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I think that one can &quot;de-condition&quot; oneself in the cultural aspect
<BR>
of the gender-roles in living together relationships, but because
<BR>
the roles played are often played unconsciously, &quot;de-conditioning&quot;
<BR>
oneself is hard work. One has to be ultra-aware to catch oneself
<BR>
playing those roles. I know that I fell into a lot of traps where I
<BR>
was playing roles that were based on some cultural biases, and many
<BR>
of those roles were not beneficial to me.
<BR>
<P>Some communities that I'm curious about for living together
<BR>
relationships are the gay and lesbian communities. Do specfic roles
<BR>
exist for each person in those partnerships? What are they, and how
<BR>
are they defined? I would guess that there is less cultural baggage
<BR>
for how a person would behave in those relationships. It may
<BR>
even be refreshing for those folks that they can start with a slate
<BR>
free from cultural biases of relationship roles.

<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;	Yeah - after the longest time, we're very belatedly starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	to escape from the almost universal cultural rule that men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	own women.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;	There's been a lot of woo-woo bullshit mythologising of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	wondrous sexual equality of `primitive' cultures [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   But the evidence is that these archaic cultures were brutally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   patrist anyway.
</EM><BR>
<P>In what time frame are you referring?
<BR>
<P>I agree with you, but we should probably state the time periods. The
<BR>
matriarchal cultures existed some many thousands of years ago, and I
<BR>
read that it really flourished between 3000 and 1200 B.C. in Sumer,
<BR>
Egypt, and the Mediterranean basin. The patriarchal cultures, then
<BR>
began to dominate couple of thousand years ago.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;	Women had a tough time, unless they knuckled under. It's not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	an accident that so many legends and folk tales in so many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	cultures are about rape and other sexual property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	infringements...
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Yes, and in the cultural traditions and religious worship, it happened
<BR>
slowly. Between 2000 and 1600 B.C., the Indo-European warrior tribes,
<BR>
the &quot;Aryans&quot;, migrated southward into the Aegean peninsula, bringing
<BR>
with them their hunting gods and sky gods. But instead of simply wiping
<BR>
out the existing religions, they &quot;fused&quot; their religious culture into
<BR>
the existing culture, gradually transforming it, and turning it into
<BR>
a hybridization of two different symbolic systems. So, for example,
<BR>
Zeus married Hera, and seduced (raped) hundreds of other goddeses
<BR>
and nymphs to establish himself.
<BR>
<P>Maybe because the mythical transformations happened so slowly, the
<BR>
people (women) then didn't notice or protest.
<BR>
<P>And some of the mythical transformations were a little bit bizarre.
<BR>
Athena, the Old European Bird Goddess, was eventually transformed
<BR>
into a militarized figure carrying a shield and wearing a helmet,
<BR>
and in the later myths she was born from the head of Zeus. Other
<BR>
goddesses who, before, could create on their own without help from
<BR>
the male deities, gradually changed into brides, wives, and
<BR>
daughters who could only create after intercourse with a god.
<BR>
<P>I think Grimm's German tales are particularly interesting. They have
<BR>
a lot of prehistoric motifs of the White Winter Goddess (the White
<BR>
Lady, &quot;Death&quot;, poisonous snake, bird-of-prey, those shuddering
<BR>
images with bone and white colors), but she is transformed into an
<BR>
old hag with a long nose, large teeth, disheveled hair. I read that
<BR>
the Brothers Grimm were suspected to &quot;purify&quot; their stories to follow
<BR>
the Christian traditions. So ancient pagan symbols are overlaid with
<BR>
Christian symbols: an old healer would become an evil witch, a spirit
<BR>
became an angel, an initiation veil became a handkerchief, a child
<BR>
named Beautiful (customary name for a child born during Solstice)
<BR>
was renamed to be Schmerzenreich: Sorrowful. Helping creatures and
<BR>
animals were transformed into demons.
