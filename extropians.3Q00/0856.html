<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm not a terribly big fan of all things big &amp; commercial; however,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this copyright issue will cut to all levels. How does anyone make money
</EM><BR>
if
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; everything can be pirated so fantastically well?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The archives of this list contain many discussions about how artists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make money in a world without copyrights.  It never ceases to amaze me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that people who claim to be creative have such a pathetic lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagination for business models, blindly assuming that the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old method of selling recordings is all there is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can also check out the archives of the Freenet project for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussions about the topic (<A HREF="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/">http://freenet.sourceforge.net/</A>).

<P>Ouch. I'm reeling (really)...
<BR>
<P>I'm afraid you'll have to spell it out for me, I'm suffering from a pathetic
<BR>
lack of imagination. If my entire audience has the idea that they need never
<BR>
(and should never) pay to listen, and reality maps onto this by way of
<BR>
pirated material which is incredibly easy to access (easier than the
<BR>
paid-for stuff), then how do I get paid?
<BR>
<P>I can see it with software, especially where large orgs have an interest; if
<BR>
they want specialised stuff, they are going to have to pay for it one way or
<BR>
another. Open Source looks really good to me in this light; saves orgs
<BR>
money, lets the code be free, very cool. I find &quot;work for hire&quot;; ie: losing
<BR>
the ability to access code I've written for someone else, really annoying,
<BR>
so something that might change some of that is great. I must say I'm also
<BR>
not such a crank about piracy in the software business, at least at the
<BR>
consumer level, because of the balancing factor; someone is still there to
<BR>
pay the bills.
<BR>
<P>But with music, who's paying the bills? There's no big orgs who are the end
<BR>
consumers; just joe public, who wants his mp3 for free.
<BR>
<P>I think the same thing goes for books, at such time as they go digital.
<BR>
<P>Emlyn
<BR>
(I'm crusing around freenet, and can't see anything about making money from
<BR>
free information so far. I'll keep looking)
