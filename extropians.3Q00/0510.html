<EM>&gt;The Nazi party was heavily influenced by the Thule group, which were a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nordic occult group formed around the turn of the century.  Many high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ranking Nazis were members of Thule and much of the party ideology and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;symbology came from there - the swastika being an ancient sun wheel symbol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(used a lot by Jews in the past) and the SS insignia being two Sigel runes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;signifying a spiritual victory.
</EM><BR>

<P>Yeah, he did veer off into the whole mystical thing in the end.  Should
<BR>
have mentioned that in my previous post on this subject.  I hear he also
<BR>
claimed to have found the Tripitz by map-dowsing.
<BR>
<P>I believe the swastika was originally called the &quot;flyfot&quot;, and represented
<BR>
all sorts of nice and wholesome things.  Apparently he reversed it from its
<BR>
normal clockwise spin to an anticlockwise spin.  That's how I could tell
<BR>
the pictures in my school history books were reversed:)  Didn't tell the
<BR>
teacher though, he wrote it!
<BR>
<P>On a lighter note, anyone ever hear this ditty before?
<BR>
<P>&quot;Hitler, he only had one ball,
<BR>
Goering, had two but they were small,
<BR>
Himmler, was very similar,
<BR>
But poor old Goebbels,
<BR>
he'd no balls at all!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Was thought up by some British guy having a bath from what I heard:)
