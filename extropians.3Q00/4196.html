<EM>&gt;All this talk of &quot;humbots&quot;; horrible.
</EM><BR>
Yeah, I thought it was an ugly term, myself, just couldn't come up with 
<BR>
anything off the cuff that was less ambiguous.  BTW, I didn't find anything 
<BR>
to disagree with in what you say, so I almost didn't respond. But, then, I 
<BR>
thought, should I only reinforce disagreements?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd lean toward the name &quot;teleoperative&gt;  Not a bad idea, altho I'm not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sure that it isn't already in use for other things.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To even achieve decent mid-range control factors, we are going to need good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wireless comms; bandwidth! In Australia, I know I can only get 9600bps over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a mobile-phone link; I'm not sure what other technologies are available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;here. 9600bps is not enough. I think some newer, better data options are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coming online soon; I'm going to keep an eye on that. What's the situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the US? What sort of data rates are available? What's on the way? I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we really need realtime video to make this plausible; probably a way off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Although there are possibilities even without it; you've got relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decent, affordable audio if you can get to 56K, so the teleoperative has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be your eyes. Still, there's a dedicated person on-site, working on your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;behalf; better than a conference call.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm interested in the state of wireless comms in the US, mainly. What's an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;affordable data rate (say using cellular networks), and what are the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;charges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like? How about if money was no object; what kind of bandwidth could we put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between a teleoperator on one side of the world, and a teleoperative on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other?
</EM><BR>
In the mid-80's, Vivid had Mandala running between the continents, with 
<BR>
French executives batting a virtual birds who flew over into the New York 
<BR>
execs screen - but they were using dedicated cable.  However, the X-10 
<BR>
people have a little RF battery-operated Video plus Audio camera available 
<BR>
for $69, with a limited range, to-be-sure (about 100').  A couple such 
<BR>
cameras - and there are many manufacturers of such with better range, 
<BR>
resolution, etc. - would give you the main data feed from the 
<BR>
&quot;teleoperative.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The signals could then feed into a pair of computers - X10 already supplies 
<BR>
the interface/software - and be sent out hi-end DSL.  Using off-the-shelf 
<BR>
hi-bandwidth local RF going to a landline/satellite instead of current 
<BR>
cellphone tech, the bandwidth is virtually unlimited for our purposes.  
<BR>
Trying to do it using just WAP would be fairly unsatisfactory at present, I 
<BR>
suspect.
