<P>
Anders you always have such interesting responses. 
<BR>
<P>Yes, I remember that computer genreated supermodel that was on the cover of 
<BR>
some magazine, a composite of the most average features that could be found 
<BR>
... looked pretty ugly to me, but yet somethign like beauty.. confusing...
<BR>
<P>Yet, looking back in history on what was considered beautiful, I wonder how 
<BR>
much of our infatuation with the &quot;average&quot; is a product of just plain *Being 
<BR>
Bombarded* with &quot;perfect&quot; blonde-blue eyed face after face after face, 
<BR>
&quot;perfect&quot; size body after body after body?  With relentless purpose, the 
<BR>
fashion industry has induced in us an ever younger, creaseless, more bland 
<BR>
perfection. Mae West could not get photographed to save her life these days, 
<BR>
and we rarely see a &quot;buff&quot; female -except on fitness mags
<BR>
- though both of those body types is nearer to perfection (IMO) than the 
<BR>
current fad for same-same guys and girlies we see in the catalogues.
<BR>
<P>It seems to me what the meme is all about these days is getting a body that 
<BR>
has *no characteristics that are personalized*. Photoshop has made this 
<BR>
possible. The airbrush courteously removes all puckers, armpits, zits, 
<BR>
compression marks, moles, body hair or any markings of individuality that the 
<BR>
body may hold. Madison Avenue's erection is not for More Than Average, it is 
<BR>
for &quot;empty&quot; of experience. This hothouse version of humanity has survived 
<BR>
nothing, been traumatized in no way, has no injury.
<BR>
<P>I find it mildly disturbing ...and compelling at the same time.
<BR>
<P><P>As well: 
<BR>
In the name of attractiveness, babies feet were bound, women's teeth 
<BR>
blackened, labrets worn through the lips and heads flattened by various 
<BR>
people who had an idea that this was TRULY beautiful! So we are always 
<BR>
vulnerable to meme-takeovers... not always rational ones, though we can 
<BR>
rationalize them. What makes us think the current scientific rationale for 
<BR>
bland features is the more valid? ; - )
<BR>
<P>You ask what kind of reengineering can we do to our libidos? Better ask - 
<BR>
what can we do to improve our meme immune system all around!
