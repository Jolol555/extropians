<EM>&gt;Note: This is my last message. I understand and respect that you don't want to hear from me anymore, but I did want to post this last reply.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I am sorry if my last post has been upsetting to all of you. However, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if you carefully read what I said in the part that triggered your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reactions, it was the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;I know from personal research that several extropians or transhumanists 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are guilty of sexually abusing children (Keith Henson, for example), 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I recently came across a persistent rumor that the same is true 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of Max More (incidentally a friend of Henson?) as well.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In other words, I said I had come across a verbal accusation from a trusted source. I openly admit that I do not at this point have legal evidence, but have strong enough indications to make me suspicious or curious. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When I bring this up here, I get attacked, pushed into weird pseudo-philosophical corners and threatened with all kinds of legal and semi-legal attacks. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;One poster in fact goes as far as using the word &quot;lynch&quot;. All I hear from Mr More is I am a liar and he wants to sue me. Others want to remove the whole thread from the archive, thereby censoring free speech. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The whole outrage is not directed at the despicable action I wonder about, but against my wondering in public. And then you are surprised that I do not wish to reveal my identity at this point?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's not that I don't agree that there could have possibly been a better way to sort this out. I simply did not foresee the fury I created, and for this I am sorry. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If the rumor is false, and if Mr More is not in support of such behavior, all that is necessary is a clear statement to that effect, not retaliation for an imagined wrong. All this excitement only makes me wonder...

This reminds me of a story I heard about LBJ's early career.
<BR>
He was running against a popular figure; a fellow who owned a hog farm.  LBJ suggested to his campaign manager that he should surreptitiously spread the rumor that his opponent was more than friendly with his barnyard charges.
<BR>
&quot;C'mon, Lyndon!&quot;, the campaign manager exclaimed.  &quot;We can't ggo around calling your opponent a pig fucker!&quot;
<BR>
&quot;No, no.&quot;, LBJ replied.  &quot;Just get the son-of-a-bitch to DENY it!&quot;
