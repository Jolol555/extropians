For anyone else interested in models of coevolution.  It appears to me
<BR>
that it's necessary to build this into an AI in order to give it the
<BR>
feedback it needs from its environment--
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;I found the following to be good as background material for
<BR>
understanding more recent research.
<BR>
State of knowledge in 1993:
<BR>
<P>Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Life 
<BR>
<P>Abstract: Genetic algorithms are computational models of evolution that
<BR>
play a central role in many artificial-life models. We review the history
<BR>
and current scope of research on genetic algorithms in artificial life,
<BR>
using illustrative examples in which the genetic algorithm is used to
<BR>
study how learning and evolution interact, and to model ecosystems,
<BR>
immune system, cognitive systems, and social systems. We also outline a
<BR>
number of open questions and future directions for genetic algorithms in
<BR>
artificial-life research.

<P><P>Cooperative Coevolution: An Architecture for Evolving Coadapted
<BR>
Subcomponents (2000)   
<BR>
<P>Abstract: To successfully apply evolutionary algorithms to the solution
<BR>
of increasingly complex problems, we must develop effective techniques
<BR>
for evolving solutions in the form of interacting coadapted
<BR>
subcomponents. One of the major difficulties is finding computational
<BR>
extensions to our current evolutionary paradigms that will enable such
<BR>
subcomponents to &quot;emerge&quot; rather than being hand designed. In this paper,
<BR>
we describe an architecture for evolving such subcomponents as a
<BR>
collection of cooperating species. Given a simple stringmatching task, we
<BR>
show that evolutionary pressure to increase the overall fitness of the
<BR>
ecosystem can provide the needed stimulus for the emergence of an
<BR>
appropriate number of interdependent subcomponents that cover multiple
<BR>
niches, evolve to an appropriate
