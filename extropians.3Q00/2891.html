[This appeared as an anonymous &quot;call to action&quot; on one of the 
<BR>
anti-genengineering lists I monitor: ]
<BR>
<P><P>A message to the elves of the night
<BR>
<P>The destruction of GE crops is on the rise in North America. In the past
<BR>
six months there have been numerous assaults on GE crops in Maine,
<BR>
Vermont, Minnesota, California and British Columbia. This is a perfect
<BR>
example of a case where the enemy is weaker than one might think. Test
<BR>
crops are easy to destroy, anyone can cut down a crop, yet the destruction
<BR>
of test crops costs seed companies considerable time. The work of these
<BR>
high tech companies can be disrupted by the most simple means. This is one
<BR>
of the reasons why the sabotage of crops has spread so widely. Because of
<BR>
the outrage over genetically modified foods many have taken direct action
<BR>
against capital. But there are many other simple ways to attack capital,
<BR>
so why stop there now that so many people have practice as elves of the
<BR>
night?
<BR>
<P>The sabotage of genetically modified crops is aimed at a new technological
<BR>
development, in this case a biotechnological development. Its aim is to
<BR>
cripple the advance of technology, which was also the aim of the Luddites
<BR>
The most recent advances are often the only forms of technology to be
<BR>
critiqued or attacked because they are the most shocking. But these recent
<BR>
advances are not separate from other forms of technology, they function
<BR>
systematically with other technologies for the utility of capital: the
<BR>
exploitation of nature and human beings. It is far more common to be
<BR>
critical of the most advanced forms of technology while the machines that
<BR>
the Luddites had sabotaged now seem benign. This is because we have grown
<BR>
up with them and often fail to see their negative effects. It is much
<BR>
easier to be critical of the technologies that we are unfamiliar with
<BR>
because we can still perceive their destructive and alien qualities. For
<BR>
example, it is easier to see that the internet is alienating and replaces
<BR>
contact with real human beings or that it increases control, than the
<BR>
telephone. We are blind to the effects of the telephone because for us
<BR>
these effects have always been there. This naturalization of technologies
<BR>
also blinds us from seeing technology as a system. We see instead
<BR>
proliferation of &quot;tools&quot;. But, for what end are these tools made? Are they
<BR>
merely made for a variety of individual human uses to fulfill a variety of
<BR>
individual needs or are they produced by systems for the use of those
<BR>
systems? Technology is produced by capitalist companies and governments
<BR>
for their use. These technologies are a product of the logic of capital.
<BR>
Our critique and our attacks must reach beyond the most recent advances of
<BR>
the technological system to other technological means of exploitation and
<BR>
alienation. Elves of the night, there is so much to do!
