<P><EM>&gt; The extermination (or enslavement) of several billion people would surely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; require an expenditure of a considerable amount of time and energy - even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for an SI.  What motivation could it have for doing so ?
</EM><BR>
<P>Some of the scientists who build SIs may feel the project entails too much risk.
<BR>
In order to satisfy the expectations of such SI workers, the SI may kill
<BR>
everyone... leaving the queasy SI workers for last.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me that most sapients consider diversity to be a very important
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing - why would a A/SI not think the same.  To keep humans around would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; require very little expense to the SI, while at the same time providing it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with an enormous pool of intellectual diversity.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, because the SI would find about as much stimulating diversity in human
<BR>
relations as humans find in poetry written by monkeys.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The notion that an SI would just wake up and decide to wipe out humanity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strikes me as absurd - to do so would require tremendous arrogance, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would hope that something supposedly more intelligent than us would realise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how stupid it was being.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>There's nothing inherently stupid about wiping out Homo sapiens sapiens
<BR>
(especially if your friends need the space).

<P>&quot;Something beckons within the reach of each of us
<BR>
to save heroic genius. Find it, and do it.
<BR>
For as goes heroic genius, so goes humankind.&quot;
