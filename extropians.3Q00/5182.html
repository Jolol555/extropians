I think that Geneva experiments are important because they
<BR>
are the first test of the s.c. tension between special relativity
<BR>
and quantum mechanics (i.e. superposition, non-locality, etc.).
<BR>
Of course the s.c. conspiracy (or peaceful coexistence) between
<BR>
special relativity and quantum mechanics (no cloning theorems,
<BR>
Jarrett's conditions, Hardy's theorems, etc.) is very cunning.

Henry P. Stapp is trying to explain non-locality by means of his
<BR>
quantum-mind-brain model.
<BR>
&lt;Orthodox Copenhagen quantum theory renounces the quest to understand
<BR>
the reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical
<BR>
rules that describe connections between our observations. However,
<BR>
an examination of certain nonlocal features of quantum theory suggests
<BR>
that the perceived need for this renunciation was due to the
<BR>
uncritical importation from classical physics of a crippling
<BR>
metaphysical prejudice, and that rejection of that prejudice
<BR>
opens the way to a dynamical theory of the interaction between
<BR>
mind and brain that has significant explanatory power.&gt;

<EM>&gt; I personally don't find these experiments very interesting.  They always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give the same result, which is that QM is true.  If they ever found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this so-called &quot;real collapse&quot;, that would violate some of the basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; principles of QM.  Granted, that would be an earthshaking result which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would certainly be worth finding out, but the chances of it being true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem very small at this point.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I class these experiments with those looking for antigravity or violations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of relativity.  I guess someone's got to do it, but it's tiresome,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unrewarding work to keep accepting the null hypothesis.
