<EM>&gt; &gt; Frankly I have had enough friends raped, mugged and even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; had a second level friend beaten to death. Like most of us I tend not to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dwell on these things too much.  But I can't help but wonder if one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; friend would still be alive and if the others would have been a lot less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; traumatized if they were armed.  The issues aren't all academic or a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matter of 2nd amendment justifying of not justifying it.  These things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are also a matter of life and death of real people, some of them quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; close to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To carry a lethal weapon, as others have pointed out, means adjusting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your thought processes to the point where you are prepared to exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lethal force.  You have to be ready to kill, if you carry a gun.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And for it to be useful in the examples cited, you have to be ready to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kill in response to an assault of less than lethal magnitude.  You need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be ready to kill in response to robbery, for example.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You have to be ready to use whatever force is necessary to defend
<BR>
yourself and your loved ones, yes.  In the case of the friend beaten to
<BR>
death with baseball bats it certainly was not a less than lethal
<BR>
situation.  In case of rape or mugging it is not at all unknown for the
<BR>
assailant to freak or wish to remove witnesses and resort to murder. 
<BR>
Having a gun in your hand means you are willing to use it.  It doesn't
<BR>
mean you will use it.  Statistically many crimes are stopped by an armed
<BR>
would be victim or witness with no shot fired.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think most people are ready to kill.  I don't think they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prepared to personally take a human life.  From what I've read, for most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people (not all) this is a tremendously traumatic experience.  To kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a human being carries the ultimate degree of finality.  You take away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything he will ever have and will ever be.  There is no chance of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reconciliation, no chance of recovery, no chance of reparing the damage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which has been done and beginning to start anew.  It's over, permanently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and forever.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but the same is true if they take away my life or if the take away
<BR>
the life of someone I care about or seriously assault them and I am
<BR>
powerless to do anything at all. The damage was done by the assaillant. 
<BR>
It is pointless to blame it on the victims or those who would defend
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems to me that preparing yourself psychologically for this action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires a certain amount of distancing and depersonalizing your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attitudes towards other people.  You can't think of your target as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human being with hopes and aspirations, struggling under the weight of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damaging experiences and harmful thoughts.  He needs to be thought of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impersonally, as a threat to be eliminated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not found it to be so in people I know who are armed.  At the
<BR>
point of the threat it is certainly true that you can't take the time
<BR>
for a philosophical debate or a psychological rap session.  Although I
<BR>
have seen explosively violent situations be defused by this with and
<BR>
without someone having the force to back up their defense.  There is
<BR>
little that is more personal and immediate than staring in the face of
<BR>
death or injury at the hands of another human being.  At the point
<BR>
someone treats you as an object of their pleasure or as an it or the
<BR>
target of their rage at the world it is they who are practicing
<BR>
impersonalization.  Not you in taking the precaution of being able to
<BR>
defend yourself and others.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In the long run, isn't it possible that this psychological adjustment will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be damaging to your relationships with other people?  Aren't killers (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potential killers) going to be a little more cold-blooded, a little more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impersonal and hard-hearted?  Might they not face a burden in setting up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alliances and working together with other people, compared to those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are more trusting, open and accepting of human limitations and weaknesses?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Again.  I have not seen any such thing in people who are armed.  It is
<BR>
precisely because they care profoundly that many of them are armed. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Taking the responsibility of carrying a gun is going to change you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It forces you to think of yourself as a killer, as one who is willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to kill.  Admittedly, if you actually save your life by carrying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun then any costs it imposes are worthwhile.  But the chance that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will actually be killed by violence are highly remote.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is assumption piled on assumption.  This categorical statement you
<BR>
make is utterly unjustified.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Given the very small probability of this outcome, the costs in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of your alienation from society must be considered significant.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long run your survival prospects will be hurt by having a lesser degree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of social connectivity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You have built a magnificent strawman.
