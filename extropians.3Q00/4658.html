<EM>&gt; I guess so. But then, the workers have to put up with crappy conditions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (commuting, parking, or expensive living). I guess it's desirable; a city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gives you lots of job opportunity in a confined area. In turn, a city gives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you lots of potential employees in a confined area.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Funny thing is, if you spread it all out a bit, commutes would probably take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just as long in the worst cases (longer distances, but faster travel because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of emptier roads, so less agravation), no parking hassles (and costs),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cheaper housing near work (which cancels out the commute quite often). I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just can't really grasp the sense of the mega high density city as a place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to put a knowledge-based business. But then, I haven't worked in the city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a long time now; can't remember what those elusive benefits are.
</EM><BR>
<P>Keep in mind that the Silicon Valley is hardly Manhattan.  The businesses
<BR>
are not stacked up in towers across the street from each other.  There are
<BR>
hi tech companies scattered over a couple hundred square miles.  This puts
<BR>
most of them within 10-20 miles of each other.
<BR>
<P>The real problem with the area is the overtaxed freeway system.  The rapid
<BR>
growth has completely overloaded the surface transportation, making
<BR>
commutes a nightmare and further penalizing people who live farther away.
<BR>
Probably other infrastructure elements are similarly strained.  But this
<BR>
is really due to growth rate, not density per se.
<BR>
<P>I work for an SV company, but I live in Santa Barbara, 400 miles away,
<BR>
and telecommute.  The office is barely over a mile from the airport as the
<BR>
crow flies, but during rush hour you're lucky to make the drive in less
<BR>
than half an hour.  It seems that many of the people in our division,
<BR>
even the ones who live in the area, go into the office as little as
<BR>
possible, just once or twice a week for meetings.
