<P>Right on, I support this position 100%. The fruit or side effect of
<BR>
increased automation, depending on your point of view, is increased
<BR>
redundancy for people. This isn't always true; as some jobs go away because
<BR>
of automation, more jobs are created at the &quot;next level up&quot;, doing the next
<BR>
thing that the machines can't do yet, and that we never tried before because
<BR>
they were too hard without the current level of automation as support. But
<BR>
to a large extent, automation has a goal of reducing manual work, and often
<BR>
succeeds.
<BR>
<P>Currently I think that more opportunities are being created as previous
<BR>
opportunities dissapear. I don't think we are seeing ever rising
<BR>
unemployment statistics in the west; it seems that the opposite is currently
<BR>
true. That would be what people call an economy, I guess.
<BR>
<P>However, as the machines get smarter (not really happening yet), the jobs
<BR>
left for people will trend more and more toward mentally difficult stuff;
<BR>
stuff that the machines aren't smart enough to do, and which many people are
<BR>
also ill equipped to handle. This is the track toward AI; Drexler talks
<BR>
about intelligent engineering systems, if I remember that book 'o' his
<BR>
correctly. I think people (or at least most people) will start to become
<BR>
entirely unable to fill any useful job at some point.
<BR>
<P>If this happened in our current economic climate, I wouldn't think much for
<BR>
the chances of these redundant masses. I've read some stuff I didn't really
<BR>
understand about &quot;democratisation of capital&quot;, maybe someone can explain
<BR>
this? Maybe the &quot;new economy&quot; has built in mechanisms which will kick in to
<BR>
balance out ensuing social problems from mega-redundancy? I'd be grateful if
<BR>
someone informed would comment on this.
<BR>
<P>Otherwise, we need something new in the way of economic systems. When
<BR>
nano-santa comes, if we are set up exactly as we are now, it's going to be a
<BR>
bad christmas for a lot of people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I worry about another problem.  Technology is still marching forward.  I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support this 101% of course.  But, as it advances it automates more and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more job levels.  I predict that within 5-10 years it will automate most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of what is called programming today.  This is only one example.  As we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get more powerful computers at lower cost with more AIish abilities more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and more jobs will fall to them.  We had best be thinking really hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right now about how we plan to have people have a decent life without a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regular for pay job.  Despite the current rather slanted rosy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unemployment statistics in the US, the problem is real and it will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eventually hit even many of us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hee hee, the old &quot;programmers will be redundant in 5-10 years&quot; line. Haven't
<BR>
heard that for a while; supposedly it's been kicking around since at least
<BR>
the 70s. It's no truer today than it has ever been.
<BR>
<P>It is true that we continue to automate things which used to be done
<BR>
manually. So why aren't all the coders on the dole queue? It's because, as
<BR>
something is automated, it becomes qualitatively different (easier) to build
<BR>
systems based on that something. In terms of possible systems, entirely new
<BR>
vistas open up, which although reliant on the newly automated something, are
<BR>
not themselves automated, and require lots of people to build them.
<BR>
<P>Once upon a time, to write software, you had to write your own OS. Then OSes
<BR>
started to appear, and provided basic functionality (loading a program into
<BR>
memory, talking to disks, basic screen handling, and all kinds of other
<BR>
stuff). Later, programmers spent a lot of time writing (console based) user
<BR>
interface code, reading and writing from primitive disk files, all those
<BR>
good things. Then databases started to become common, and GUIs became
<BR>
common, and other things became the programmer's task. Now people wanted
<BR>
nicer printouts, programs that interoperated, pretty gui front ends, and,
<BR>
urm, networking! Programmers wrote lots and lots of code by hand, performing
<BR>
those tasks; evetually it was again subsumed into the OS. At some point
<BR>
Microsoft invented VB, and programmers were redundant forever shortly
<BR>
thereafter.
<BR>
<P>Or that's the hype... oddly enough, there is such a thing as a VB
<BR>
programmer, with possibly more positions available than any other
<BR>
language/environment. Because the things it makes easy to do are easy to do,
<BR>
sure. But now people can imagine even more complex systems, which they would
<BR>
not have attempted before, which they can now just accomplish by writing
<BR>
lots and lots of code. If they do these things in VB, it's often even
<BR>
harder.
<BR>
<P>This continues. As far as I can see, the tools have improved incredibly
<BR>
beyond what I was using 10 years ago when I started uni. So much more is
<BR>
possible; it's astounding. And yet, paradoxically, it is harder than ever to
<BR>
be a programmer. The job is getting more and more difficult. Why?
<BR>
<P>Well, because people want to interoperate. Heterogeneous networks,
<BR>
applications, software layers, layer upon layer like a crazy croissant,
<BR>
building new, more ambitious, more interesting systems than ever before. The
<BR>
new economy, with the 'net as the centerpiece, is a mish mash of components
<BR>
and chunks and layers and stuff, all trying to talk to each other, all
<BR>
idiosyncratic, brittle, cranky code stretched out like a net weaved of scrap
<BR>
metal. Making this stuff hang together is a mad job, done at a frenetic
<BR>
speed as old technologies die and new technologies are born. There's no
<BR>
comfort zone. There's no pause for breath. There's certainly no sign of AI
<BR>
taking over any time soon!
<BR>
<P>People have been worried about the contrary point of view; that our systems
<BR>
are getting so big, so unwieldy, that at some point we cross a failure
<BR>
threshold, beyond which we cannot, as a bunch of humans, reliably maintain
<BR>
the systems any more. Why would this be true?
<BR>
<P>Well, much of the problem is that, even though basic OS features are
<BR>
&quot;automated&quot;, even though the user interface (gui), persistent storage
<BR>
(databases), communications (networks) are &quot;automated&quot;, they actually
<BR>
aren't. These things work well now, but they are never quite perfect (some
<BR>
people would say they are not even close!). Just ask UI programmers,
<BR>
database programmers, OS coders, network engineers. All the hordes of
<BR>
people, working to make/maintain the  &quot;automated&quot; systems, the stuff that is
<BR>
already &quot;done&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Something really different will have to happen to change this picture. Super
<BR>
intelligent AI could do it (so could the wish fairies). Genetic programming
<BR>
advances might have a shot, but will still require humans to coordinate them
<BR>
at some level, especially given that our ambitions will increase by orders
<BR>
of magnitude as our abilities increase, to keep us focused on what is just
<BR>
out of reach. The job of configuring such magical genetic programmed
<BR>
automated systems to reach these new goals will look a lot like, well,
<BR>
programming.
<BR>
<P>Sure the techniques will change. Sure the skill set required will change.
<BR>
But the basic programming job will remain, and grow wider in my opinion.
<BR>
Lots of things will begin to look like programming in the future, which do
<BR>
not now. Biotech might get to a point of &quot;automation&quot; where it starts using
<BR>
programmers. Through nanotech, even the bricks &amp; mortar world will start to
<BR>
become a programming concern.
<BR>
<P>Programming is the creative edge of automation. At any point, we are
<BR>
automated to a certain degree, and some people will look around them and say
<BR>
&quot;I can make something new, something no one has tried before, something that
<BR>
can't be done by the fully automated systems&quot;. Then they need programmers.
<BR>
The programmers build the thing (with luck), and the edge of automation
<BR>
advances, and a new horizon is revealed.
