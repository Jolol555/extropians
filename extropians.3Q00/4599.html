<P><EM> &gt; Good, so are we.  This is meaningless drivel.  We want to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; build a system of governance--with most of the same services
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that governments provide today--but on a moral foundation.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; We only seek to destroy those functions of government that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are positively evil, and which no sane human being could
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; possibly support.  The rest we hope will become irrelevant
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; as those services are provided privately.
</EM><BR>
<P>All noble goals, and such, but this is a relatively novel
<BR>
approach. This has not been tried on a large scale before. Clearly, it
<BR>
would make sense to try an experiment first, establishing an
<BR>
artificial Libber state, along the lines of Israel?
<BR>
<P>It should be very possible to purchase an island or a patch of desert
<BR>
land from some weak 3rd world goverment for good cash in return for
<BR>
being granted effective freedom to do whatever you like. These are
<BR>
harsh conditions, since all the sweet spots are already taken, but the
<BR>
kibuzzin managed to turn barren desert into high-productivity crops,
<BR>
surely the Libertarians claiming high efficiency can do as well or
<BR>
better? Can't claims to apparent superiority wait until proven in
<BR>
reality? And clearly it is futile trying to establish a pocket of
<BR>
Libertarianism in the industrialized north (Harry Browne is not even
<BR>
being ignored), with it's established opposing power infrastructure?
