Well said. Maybe the Itallian translation was somehow off a bit in its 
<BR>
publishing. Tipler does clearly state the Omega Point name was clearly 
<BR>
inspired by Teilhard De Chardin; a fellow who always got in trouble with the 
<BR>
Church for advocationg evolution and then finding evidence of it in Algeria 
<BR>
(where he was presumably sent as punishment years before) and discovering the 
<BR>
Peking Man's remains in China, also.
<BR>
<P>Tipler speculates that religion, as such, must become a part of science, in 
<BR>
the sense that religion, to keep people involved, will have to adjust to 
<BR>
physical theory--based on fact. But thats it!  Barrow and Tipler's Final 
<BR>
Anthropic Principle are as useful to disbelieving Atheists, as they are to 
<BR>
the deeply religious. That is to say, if it works, it works globally; as 
<BR>
anti-biotics works globally, and electricty works for everyone.
<BR>
<P>If it works, then no one religion, cult, or atheist collective can own it, 
<BR>
anymore then one can possess the discoveries of Copernicus (Kopernik). If 
<BR>
there is an Omega Point we are not speaking of it actually ocurring for at 
<BR>
least 100 billion years, and more like trillions or quadrillions of years. So 
<BR>
these ANSA folks can take time for a coffee ;-)  Until the we have a Lot  of 
<BR>
work to be done.

&nbsp;are telling me they are changing their mind, about extropism. Now they think 
<BR>
that extropians are not a *sect* as Ansa (a sort of italian Reuters) 
<BR>
announced many months ago (but I did not read this).Of course: they still do 
<BR>
not *embrace the future* (the best known extropic motto, in Italy) and they 
<BR>
do not believe in *omega-points* (the second best known extropic thing, in 
<BR>
Italy).

<BR>
&nbsp;p.s. 
<BR>
&nbsp;Note that Italy appreciated so much, during ' 60, the french catholic 
<BR>
philosopher Teilhard de Chardin and his omega-point-human-deity !  &gt;&gt;
