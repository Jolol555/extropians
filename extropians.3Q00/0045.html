That's fine if you believe that- but what if you didn't believe it? Why
<BR>
should you be forced to contribute to that system? Why not have an option
<BR>
to not contribute and also be denied access to it? It's like the government
<BR>
has chosen a religion for you, and you have no choice but to worship it.

<EM>&gt; &gt;... the wealthiest in society ...can still choose and demand quality,

<EM>&gt; I'm sure everyone is finding this discussion as numbing as I, although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps for different reasons. Still, I feel obliged to make a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The `unreal' or `coercive' service (publicly funded) is clearly of benefit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to *everyone* since:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rich, as I noted (at least in Australia, maybe not elsewhere) often use
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their access to large tax-funded hospitals and their specialised machines,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; staff, etc;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doctors tend to be trained in these hospitals, and in Oz at least they get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their education at public universities;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; late industrial civilisation benefits immensely by having almost all its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citizens reasonably healthy, immunized,  ready for work and not falling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about in the street, which is perhaps best ensured by health services
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; readily available to everyone--just as it is sensible to have as many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people as possible able to read, count, calculate and wipe their arses, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just those whose parents are prepared and able to pay for instilling these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; skills on a private basis (even if that is a better way to go for those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can and are willing to do so).
