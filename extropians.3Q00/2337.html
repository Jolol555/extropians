<EM>&gt;  What has recently struck me is that the RIAA has managed to destroy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  music industry.  If they'd arranged to sell songs for a dollar online,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  they might have moved the traditional market into ecommerce, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cheating would be perceived as evil.  Now, people have the expectation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of free music.  People are used to downloading free music.  Even if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  RIAA eventually gets a clue and moves to correct the mistake, the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  will be divided into unusually ethical buyers and the mass of pirates,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  instead of the mass of buyers and the unusually unethical pirates.

<P>Yes, the same thought occurred to me when I read the post saying 'Stephen 
<BR>
King's plan worked'. Yeah, it wroked, since it was so highly publicized, and 
<BR>
the timing was right. 
<BR>
<P>But... weren't you thinking, ok but let's see what happens if you asked the 
<BR>
Napster traders to voluntarily donate a dollar.. hell even a quarter, let's 
<BR>
say *directly to the artists* (since everyone seems to think it's OK to rip 
<BR>
off big companies but not artists), every time they download. What do you 
<BR>
think would happen?
