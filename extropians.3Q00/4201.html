<BR>
There are several advantages to powering a robot with ambient 
<BR>
vegetation.  The energy content of vegetation is relatively high -- plant 
<BR>
carbohydrates (sugars and starches) have about the same energy density 
<BR>
as lithium batteries; digestive mechanisms can be made light and 
<BR>
compact (as nature testifies); and vegetation is very widely 
<BR>
distributed in both time and space.  Several labs around the world 
<BR>
are exploring the option, which so far is understood as tapping 
<BR>
into the electron transport chain stimulated by the microbial 
<BR>
fermentation of some carbohydrate.  These electrons are then 
<BR>
organized around one end of the circuit, making in effect a 
<BR>
microbial fuel cell.  Machines competent to extract energy from 
<BR>
this source could live off the land unattended for years at a time.  
<BR>
<P>Applications are not hard to imagine.   For the military, guns that 
<BR>
live in the forest; for consumers, gardening robots that rake, weed, 
<BR>
trim, and prune, and feed themselves with the results of their labor. 
<BR>
Environmental managers might have a need for autonomous mobile sensor 
<BR>
platforms that could both respond to requests to visit given sectors 
<BR>
and then establish a working presence in those sectors for long 
<BR>
periods. Perhaps the most ambitious application would be designing 
<BR>
ecological links as needed, such as a machine for detecting and eating 
<BR>
&quot;foreign species&quot; (however that is to be defined), or accelerating 
<BR>
nutrient cycles.  
<BR>
<P>Such a device would need a sense of taste to make sure it did 
<BR>
not accidently eat something toxic to its fermenters;  the problem of 
<BR>
long-term autonomous maintenance remains unsolved; some policy needs 
<BR>
to be worked out wrt robot poop.  However, there do not seem to be any 
<BR>
shoestoppers.  See www.gastrobots.com.
