<P><EM>&gt; I have never had that experince myself, tho' I believe the Hindu's called it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Satori. My brother in law described something similar years ago watching the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; waves come in on the beach, and a sense of the stars on the horizon and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life in the shallows somehow being interconected, as one process etc.  Also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there was in James Horgan's book, The End of Science, his own personal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parietal-lobe experience, when he claimed to have experienced God as a single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind, many minds (psylocibin?).
</EM><BR>
<P>In the Hindu tradition it is called &quot;samadhi&quot;.  There are various
<BR>
flavors of samadhi described in yoga literature.  I believe &quot;satori&quot; is
<BR>
the term used for much the same thing in Zen Buddhism iirc.  There are
<BR>
terms for similar states in the mystic writings of many religions and
<BR>
traditions.  The million dollar question is what these states are and to
<BR>
what extent they are or are not useful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; Ever play with the notion that somewhere in this Universe some species
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of intelligent being may well have kicked off a Singularity and created
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  one or more Singularity class intelligences?  If they did who is to say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that such Powers may not occassionally tickle the minds and cultures of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  developing species with ideas/images/memes leading to the creation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  others of their kind  and/or preparing for the acknowledgement of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  existing ones?  For that matter are we totally certain that our own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Singularity will never have the ability to reach backward in time and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  influence the smoothness and particulars of its own becoming?  What if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  some of the trascendent glimmerings of what most call God or Void or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  whatever are actually forebodings and/or backward or external reachings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of such?  Wildly speculative I know. Probably impossible to test or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  falsify.  But something I can't rule out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It might even be a key useful in understanding and even pulling into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  some cooperation the world's religions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  - samantha &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, its a compelling vision, so to speak. I, myself, am hung up on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; monotheism, so I rather am mostly focused on a Single Mind, which the earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peoples called God. To me Mind is the central thing to study, cause that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what makes us the thinking animals we are.  Physics is now replete with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concepts that seem from our vantage point miraculous, so why not have Mind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being part of it. If that is not to someone's taste-so be it. What if these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insights and what-not eventuate in &quot;God&quot;, however that is conceived. I am ok
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with this as long as it doesn't remain a meme owned by bombers and torturers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe that is what you are instinctively involved with, taking God back from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the book-burners and fanatics?
</EM><BR>
<P>Personally I think that Singularity class minds are likely to merge into
<BR>
larger Mind.  But that is an intuition or even a prejudice rather than
<BR>
something I can make an argument for that is more than a rationalization
<BR>
of an already existing belief.  
<BR>
<P>I think &quot;miraculous&quot; is a point of view or way of looking at some aspect
<BR>
or other.  I am not at all sure &quot;God&quot; can be taken back from the
<BR>
book-burners and fantatics for the simple reason that that entire
<BR>
concept has become so conflated with that level of &quot;religion&quot;.  So I
<BR>
hesitate to put such labels on some of what I experience.  I am
<BR>
increasingly convinced that there is a perfectly valid and very
<BR>
important seed at the heart of religion/spirituality that should not be
<BR>
lost and is quite needed as we go forward toward a sci-tech
<BR>
Singularity.  But I don't yet know or at least I don't yet own what I
<BR>
can/should do about that, if anything.  I also believe that some of the
<BR>
self-examination, self-transformation techniques from different
<BR>
spiritual systems will be quite important in unraveling some of our
<BR>
genetically programmed and learned behavior patterns that may
<BR>
increasingly be in our way. And I think that some of the traditional
<BR>
practices and goal states are at the least partial tools and states
<BR>
needed to actually live peacefully and happily with increasingly
<BR>
god-like powers.   They are at least a possible source of some ideas and
<BR>
hints that might turn out to be very useful.
