<P><EM>&gt; Irrelevant. Humans are intelligent, yet are biggest predators and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inflictors of agony on this planet, simply because their intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allows them to pursue their agenda on a grander scale. In similiar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumstances, cats or weasels would have done worse.

<P>Yes, I agree that (some) humans commit the cruelest and most depraved acts,
<BR>
placing themselves below the level of animals. At the same time, other humans
<BR>
rise above selfishness to provide examples of saintly benevolence. So it's not
<BR>
just a question of intelligence alone. I suggest that sanity is more important
<BR>
than raw IQ when it comes to Moravec's Mind Children, Kurzweil's Spiritual
<BR>
Machines, D'Aluisio's Robo sapiens, or de Garis' Artilects. The most important
<BR>
question, it seems to me, relates to how humanity can become sane.
<BR>
IOW, is it sane to want to create an AI?
