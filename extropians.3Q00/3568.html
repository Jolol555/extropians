<P>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE AUGUST 25 2000
<BR>
<P>IN THIS ISSUE AUGUST 25 2000:  LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Estrogen
<BR>
replacement fails to protect heart patients; PROTOCOLS:  Female Hormone
<BR>

<BR>
MAGAZINE, August 2000:  Hormone replacement and heightened cancer risk;

PRODUCT OF THE MONTH:  ProFem; BLOOD TEST SPECIAL!
<BR>
<P>Estrogen replacement fails to protect heart patients
<BR>
<P>The lead article in this week's (August 24, 2000) New England Journal of
<BR>
Medicine reiterates what we've been hearing for months now: hormone
<BR>
replacement therapy in women may not protect against the progression of
<BR>
cardiovascular disease.
<BR>
<P>Studies reported in the news recently have warned that hormone replacement
<BR>
therapy (HRT) can lead to a woman's increased chances of breast cancer.
<BR>
Physicians have known that HRT could increase the risk of breast cancer,
<BR>
but have stressed its supposed heart protective benefit as justifying that
<BR>
risk. Heart disease is the number one killer of women in this country,
<BR>
followed by cancer, with breast cancer being among the most common types
<BR>
of cancer experienced by women.
<BR>
<P>In an attempt to confirm findings of a previous study, researchers
<BR>
conducting the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial assigned 309
<BR>
women with coronary disease either 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogen daily,
<BR>
estrogen plus 2.5 mg of synthetic progesterone, or a placebo. The women
<BR>
were followed for a mean 3.2 years. Although the women receiving the
<BR>
hormones experienced lower LDL and higher HDL levels which have been
<BR>
correlated with a lower incidence of heart disease, coronary angiograms
<BR>
taken before and after treatment did not show a significant difference in
<BR>
the progression of atherosclerosis between the groups, nor was there a
<BR>
significant difference in the amount of cardiovascular events experienced.
<BR>
<P>The abstract concluded with the statement, &quot;These results suggest that
<BR>
such women should not use estrogen replacement with an expectation of
<BR>
cardiovascular benefit.&quot; The authors added that it is unknown whether
<BR>
estrogen replacement could effect the development of primary coronary
<BR>
artery disease. They speculate that estrogen's benefit in  preventing
<BR>
atherosclerosis could be offset by its promotion of inflammation, and
<BR>
refer to several studies that show an elevation in C-reactive protein in
<BR>
women using both estrogen alone or combined with progestins, which is
<BR>
associated with increased inflammation and an elevated risk of
<BR>
cardiovascular events.
<BR>
<P><P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Female Hormone Modulation Therapy
<BR>
<P>Concern about the life-threatening side effects of synthetic hormone drugs
<BR>
has caused many women to be deprived of the benefits of safe natural
<BR>
hormone replacement therapy.
<BR>
<P>Proper hormone modulation can prevent degenerative disease and improve
<BR>
functioning in both the physical and emotional spheres of life, both at
<BR>
menopause and throughout life. For example, many sexual &quot;dysfunctions,&quot;
<BR>
including lack of desire, can be mitigated when hormone levels are
<BR>
naturally restored to a youthful profile.
<BR>
<P>Starting around age 45 to 50, women face a perplexing dilemma regarding
<BR>
estrogen, one of the primary sex hormones. The amount of estrogen
<BR>
naturally produced by their bodies dwindles. This estrogen deficiency
<BR>
causes a wide variety of menopausal miseries, including hot flashes,
<BR>
depression, vaginal dryness, anxiety, and forgetfulness.
<BR>
<P>The following nutrients and drugs are suggested to restore hormone balance
<BR>
in aging women or women with symtoms of an imbalance:
<BR>
1. Natural progesterone cream (ProFem): Apply topically to the skin
<BR>
(follow directions as outlined in this protocol).
<BR>
2. Natural Estrogen: Take one capsule, 2 times a day.
<BR>
3. DHEA: Take one 15 mg capsule, 1 to 2 times a day.
<BR>
4. Life Extension Mix (multivitamin supplement): Take 3 tablets, 3 times a
<BR>
day.
<BR>
5. Melatonin: Take 2 to 3 mg only at bedtime.
<BR>
6. Consider supplementation with fish, flax, or Perilla oil to restore
<BR>
fatty acid balance.
<BR>
7. Consider estriol or TriEst if menopausal symptoms are not alleviated by
<BR>
nonprescription therapies. Blood or saliva testing may also indicate the
<BR>
need for additional estrogen or progesterone.
<BR>
Blood or saliva testing after 45 days is mandatory to verify you are
<BR>
taking the proper dosages.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>PROTOCOL
<BR>
Male Hormone Modulation Therapy
<BR>
<P>As men age past year 40, hormonal changes occur that perceptibly inhibit
<BR>
physical, sexual, and cognitive function. The outward appearance of a
<BR>
typical middle aged male shows increased abdominal fat and shrinkage of
<BR>
muscle mass, a hallmark effect of hormone imbalance. A loss of feeling of
<BR>
well being, sometimes manifesting as depression, is a common psychological
<BR>
complication of hormone imbalance.
<BR>
<P>A remarkable amount of data has been compiled indicating that many of the
<BR>
diseases that middle aged men begin experiencing, including depression,
<BR>
abdominal weight gain, and prostate and heart disease, are directly
<BR>
related to hormone imbalances that are correctable with currently
<BR>
available drug and nutrient therapies. To the patient's detriment,
<BR>
conventional doctors are increasingly prescribing drugs to treat
<BR>
depression, elevated cholesterol, angina, and a host of other diseases
<BR>
that may be caused by an underlying hormone imbalance.
<BR>
<P>If doctors checked their male patients' blood levels of estrogen,
<BR>
testosterone, thyroid, and DHEA (instead of prescribing drugs to treat
<BR>
symptoms), they might be surprised to learn that many problems could be
<BR>
eliminated by adjusting hormone levels to fit the profile of a healthy
<BR>
21-year-old.
<BR>
<P>When embarking on a hormone modulation program, medical testing is
<BR>
critical. First, a baseline blood PSA must be taken to rule out existing
<BR>
prostate cancer. Then free testosterone and estradiol tests are needed to
<BR>
make sure that too much testosterone is not being converted into estradiol
<BR>
(estrogen). If estrogen levels are too high, the use of aromatase
<BR>
inhibitors can keep testosterone from converting (aromatizing) into
<BR>
estrogen in the body. Follow-up testing for estrogen, testosterone, and
<BR>
PSA are needed to rule out occult prostate cancer and to fine tune your
<BR>
program. It's possible that testosterone patches and creams can increase
<BR>
testosterone levels too much. In that case, blood or saliva testing could
<BR>
save you money by allowing you to use less of the testosterone drug.

<BR>
<P><P><P>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE, August 2000
<BR>
Hormone replacement and heightened cancer risk
<BR>
<P>A NEW PIECE OF THE PUZZLE ABOUT the adverse effects of hormone replacement
<BR>
therapy has emerged from a recent mainstream scientific study. Use of the
<BR>
synthetic estrogen/progestin drug combination can more than double the
<BR>
risk of a certain type of breast cancer in menopausal women, according to
<BR>
a study completed recently at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
<BR>
in Seattle, Washington.
<BR>
<P>This is the latest in a series of studies to connect estrogen and
<BR>
progestin to a heightened risk of cancer. As one bit of damning evidence
<BR>
after another has emerged, even mainstream, establishment researchers have
<BR>
begun to question the advisability of this astonishingly widespread
<BR>
treatment.
<BR>
<P>The new findings, reported in the journal Cancer (88:2570-2577, 2000),
<BR>
pertain to a relatively rare form of breast cancer. But they indicated
<BR>
that, in those cases, the magnitude of hazard is substantial.
<BR>
Investigators focused on what is known as lobular breast cancer. This
<BR>
malignancy occurs in the milk-producing lobules of the breasts and
<BR>
accounts for 10% to 15% of all cases.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Our finding is only preliminary, but it is significant on several
<BR>
counts,&quot; lead researcher Christopher Li, M.D. told LIFE EXTENSION. &quot;First,
<BR>
it establishes a danger of considerable significance.&quot;
<BR>

<BR>
<P>PRODUCT OF THE MONTH
<BR>
ProFem
<BR>
<P>Pro Fem contains USP natural progesterone from soy. Pro Fem is used by
<BR>
women to prevent osteoporosis, premenstrual syndrome, some cancers and
<BR>
some of the side effects of estrogen replacement therapy. Massage into
<BR>
soft tissue areas such as chest, breast, underarms, wrist, abdomen or
<BR>
inner thighs and apply to a different area every day to avoid saturating
<BR>
the fat cells.

<P>BLOOD TEST SPECIAL
<BR>
<P>Life Extension Foundation, in collaboration with American Metabolic
<BR>
Laboratories, is offering the Longevity Profile  for the special price of
<BR>
$750.00. This is a saving of $35.00 off the regular Life Extension member
<BR>
price and $504.00 off a commercial laboratory's patients' price. In
<BR>
addition, to promote measures of disease prevention, when a member
<BR>
requests the Longevity Profile,  our staff physician will order a PSA
<BR>
prostate cancer test for men, or a CA-15-3 breast cancer test for women at
<BR>
no additional charge.
<BR>
<P>The Longevity Profile is the most comprehensive series of blood tests that
<BR>
every individual is strongly recommended to have performed annually. It is
<BR>
composed of:
<BR>
<P>Chemistry Profile and Complete Blood Count (40+  blood tests for   general
<BR>
health)
<BR>
<P>Cancer Profile for possible early detection of cancer and/or followup of
<BR>
therapy,including DHEA-S and TSH for thyroid function
<BR>
<P>PTH for detection of bone loss due to calcium deficiency, etc.
<BR>
<P>IGF-1 (Somatomedin) the youth hormone
<BR>
<P>Sex Hormones: Estradiol, Progesterone, Free-Testosterone,
<BR>
<P>Heart Disease Prevention markers: Homocysteine and hs-CRP
<BR>
<P>Stress Hormone tests: Cortisol a.m. and p.m.
<BR>
<P>This blood testing panel can reveal a number of developing diseases. If
<BR>
abnormalities are found at an early stage, reversal can often be
<BR>
accomplished.
<BR>
<P>The SPECIAL is effective through November 13, 2000
