I was just thinking that many of the people who hate GM food and transgenic 
<BR>
animals, particularly the most extreme eco-terrorist ones, somehow have 
<BR>
deluded themselves into thinking that genetic engineering is a tool of 
<BR>
oppression - that the widespread use of GM will result in them not being 
<BR>
able to do what they want to do.
<BR>
A way to counter this is ro provide them with a case where GM will allow 
<BR>
them a greater amount of freedom then they already have. I've thought of a 
<BR>
way to do this which I think is within current or nearly-current technology. 
<BR>
I came up with this idea several years ago but just realized it's 
<BR>
propogandistic value today: genetically engineer a strain of grass (common 
<BR>
lawn grass) which produces THC, and other chemicals found in marijuana. 
<BR>
Immediately, many of the people (from the left side of the anti-GM spectrum) 
<BR>
who are now protesting GM food suddenly can grow their favorite drug, right 
<BR>
in their front lawn, without arousing detection. The argument against hemp 
<BR>
is that it will make it easier to grow marijuana - the argument applies here 
<BR>
as well, to a much higher degree.. everyone has a lawn. How easy would it be 
<BR>
to select a corner of it specifically for GM grass, nobody would ever 
<BR>
suspect - prohibition would completely crumble. Could this be done? Is it as 
<BR>
easy as inserting a single gene as has already been done in hundreds of 
<BR>
other cases?
<BR>
This would probably backfire if done in isolation without anything else to 
<BR>
appease the religious right wing &quot;you're playing god!&quot; aspect as well.
