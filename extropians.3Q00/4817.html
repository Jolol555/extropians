<P>
Long time readers may remember that several years ago we had a debate here
<BR>
with David Brin, award winning science fiction writer and author of The
<BR>
Transparent Society.  In that book he advanced the thesis that society
<BR>
should move towards &quot;transparency&quot;, a state of decentralized surveillance
<BR>
where the question of &quot;who watches the watchers&quot; is answered by saying,
<BR>
we are all the watchers, and we watch each other.
<BR>
<P>At the time I accused David of being motivated by his own desire to
<BR>
protect the intellectual property on which his income as a novelist
<BR>
and writer depended.  Without transparency it would be easy for people
<BR>
to pirate novels and other works of art.  Attempts to crack down can
<BR>
be thwarted by using cryptographic techniques to hide the data being
<BR>
exchanged and even the identities of the participants.  David focused
<BR>
especially on the cryptographic challenge to transparency, and I felt
<BR>
that this was his true concern, although he covered a wide range of
<BR>
issues in the book.  (I don't know if I was right in my accusation; it
<BR>
doesn't really matter, as others have taken up the cause of transparency.)
<BR>
<P>Of course in those pre-Napster days the notion of intellectual property
<BR>
being threatened by the Net was a rather abstract concern.  Now it is
<BR>
a much more concrete and visible threat.  In an article about the recent
<BR>
SF convention I read,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the SFWA (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.sfwa.org) business meeting, discussions included reports
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the efforts to combat Internet piracy of authors works on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newsgroups, Napster, Gnutella, etc.
<BR>
<P>Whether or not this was truly a concern of David Brin several years ago,
<BR>
it has apparently become an issue for the industry as a whole.  Still it
<BR>
seems that novelists have several years breathing room before they have
<BR>
to worry.  It is hardly practical today to unbind, scan and text-convert
<BR>
books into electronic form.  (Although my own employer actually did rely
<BR>
on just this technique for several years to export its cryptographic
<BR>
software, exploiting a First Amendment exemption.)
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure that David's transparency would necessarily fix the IP
<BR>
problem, anyway.  In a truly transparent world, shouldn't I be able to
<BR>
look over David's shoulder as he types up his latest novel?  Shouldn't I
<BR>
have access to it in the files on his computer?  And if I buy the book,
<BR>
shouldn't my friends be able to read it at the same time that I do,
<BR>
via my wearable webcam?
<BR>
<P>I suspect that David would say that the answer to all these questions is
<BR>
no, because as I said I think his intention in proposing transparency was
<BR>
to save IP, not destroy it.  I wonder how others would see the relation
<BR>
between a transparent society and intellectual property.  Do they go
<BR>
together, or are they incompatible and contradictory?
<BR>
