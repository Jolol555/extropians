<EM>&gt; &gt;All snipped

<EM>&gt; &gt;This could go on forever since these are mostly subjective points.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Some people like living in villages in Europe, some people like living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in crowded cities. So be it.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm wondering why you started this thread. Your conversational style
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and conversational strategy isn't very constructive for any of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought it would be possible to nail down certain reasons in common
<BR>
that was keeping more people from coming to the US. And I wanted to
<BR>
see if that reason might be that the people had gotten addicted to their
<BR>
government even if it might be more rational to move to somewhere that
<BR>
could result in the development of more personal power. That didn't happen.
<BR>
<P>Each person had their own reasons... even in your post you simply listed
<BR>
the few things in Germany that you really like. But you really didn't
<BR>
answer the question of why not move to the US, unless you are saying
<BR>
those things are the deciding difference for you.
<BR>
<P>Looking back at the archive, I see my thread had this result:
<BR>
<P>one person asked for resumes.
<BR>
one person flamed me for ignoring the INS issue, and then didn't really
<BR>
&nbsp;go into why they wouldn't consider moving.
<BR>
one person said they probably could get more money and a cable modem in
<BR>
&nbsp;the US.. went off topic... and then seemed to say that risk of getting
<BR>
&nbsp;shot was why they wanted to stay in Australia.
<BR>
one person (who apparently already is in the US, so I am not sure why
<BR>
&nbsp;they came onto the thread) seemingly infected with some strong anti-
<BR>
&nbsp;US memes used terms such as car-dependent-society (I tried to refute
<BR>
&nbsp;that) and suburban-deserts to describe the US and to try to make an
<BR>
&nbsp;argument apparently for living in Europe even though that person later
<BR>
&nbsp;admitted to never having even visited there.
<BR>
<P>I think I definitely got a little frustrated in my replies, but I think
<BR>
I had reason.
