<P>
I mentioned that a short story by Deutsch was at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.qubit.org/people/david/TheWayBack.html">http://www.qubit.org/people/david/TheWayBack.html</A>
<BR>
<P>and, by the way, please note that I *didn't* use the subject line `a
<BR>
wonderful story by David Deutsch'; it's okay, but I thought it worth noting
<BR>
because of what it seemed to suggest about movement across the `Many
<BR>
Worlds'. This was actually misleading, I now learn. By a stroke of luck, I
<BR>
found on the list dedicated to Deutsch's ideas the following recent
<BR>
exchange in which David responds to someone's questions:
<BR>
<P>============================
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the internet at:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.hedweb.com/everett/everett.htm#how">http://www.hedweb.com/everett/everett.htm#how</A>    there is a many-worlds FAQ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of the answered questions is &quot;Where are these other worlds?&quot; The
</EM><BR>
answer is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; :&quot;Non-relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unambiguous: the other Everett-worlds occupy the same space and time as we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do.&quot; I found this to be a little unnerving, though just about as
</EM><BR>
unnerving as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; MWI itself, which I happen to be partial to (but only in this world). I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wondering if this is a widely accepted conclusion for those subscribing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MWI.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mention it because Cristina mentioned the possibility of slipping from one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world into another very similar world without ever knowing it. What sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'possible' this is I have no idea,
</EM><BR>
<P>A fictional one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; but it seems a little more possible considering that all these worlds share
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same space and time as we do.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it doesn't.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The other thing i'd like to mention is the short story on Deutsch's web page
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (if it is still there). It seemingly, though not explicitly, suggests the
</EM><BR>
sort
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of thing that Cristina mentioned. In any case it is a good story.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's fiction. As I said in a previous post:
<BR>
<P>[Moving between the universes] doesn't make sense at all. If you 'moved'
<BR>
from one universe to another, even a perfectly identical one, you would
<BR>
notice instantly, because there would be another copy of you there. (If the
<BR>
copy was in the same location, you would 'move' into in the same position
<BR>
and there would be a large bang.)
<BR>
<P>This sort of thing never happens. Moreover, it is forbidden by quantum
<BR>
theory (except, as Ant said, in the presence of time travel devices).
<BR>
<P>===================================
<BR>
<P>Just thought I'd better clarify that.
