<EM>&gt; &gt; Dear List Members
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Some of these posts are disturbing - I cannot descern sarcasm from factual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; statement; the women from the righteous males. In short, I cannot believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what I'm reading.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; As a human who happens to reside in female form, I am most interested in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your personal pov on forced-pregnancy and abortion. Perhaps you would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; willing to share your feelings and experiences:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1. Do you think a female should be forced to endure every pregnancy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think a female should be forced to get pregnant. Anything else that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens is a result of either consensus decisions between her and the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involved, or a negotiated settlement or ruling enforced by courts if complete
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consensus is not reached prior to conception. Note that while two people may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consensual about having sex, they very likely have not reached a consensus about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what to do for the next 18 years if she gets pregnant.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Do you believe birth control is wholly effective?  No?  Do you believe
<BR>
that human beings have a strong enough urge for sex that they very
<BR>
nearly must have sexual activity to stay sane for part of their lives? 
<BR>
Maybe yes?  Then it is obvious that women cannot fully claim to have
<BR>
chosen to get pregnant every time they do.  
<BR>
<P>Males, in case you haven't noticed, are much more irresponsible, er
<BR>
driven to have sex as often as possible and with less consideration of
<BR>
consequences (as a gender based generality) than females.  A male
<BR>
doesn't have to stick around to bear any consequences and it is
<BR>
ludricrous to claim that he generally has as much say in whether the
<BR>
woman decides to abort as she does.  Especially if there is no binding
<BR>
contract between them.  
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure, but a pregancy does not involve just one body. You are dealing, in fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with three bodies (at a minimum), and any woman so callous as to totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disregard the rights and concerns of the other two very likely would be a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poor candidate for motherhood anyways, not to mention for being human, but of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course, there is a matter of context/circumstances, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>All three bodies do not have equal stakes and one of those bodies is not
<BR>
even a person but a fetus.  So what is it with this wierd position? 
<BR>
Callous my ass.  Carry around a fetal parasite within you that you never
<BR>
wanted at the insistent of people who claim the right to pressure you to
<BR>
do so and then tell me all these other people and psuedo-people have the
<BR>
same right and stake.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 4. As a female, would you terminate an untimely pregnancy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since I'm not, I don't have to worry about that, as a female. As a male, I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already once been through an experience where a girlfriend got pregnant, did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me, went off and got an abortion, and I did not hear about it for a couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years from a third party. We broke up before I found out, for likely the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasons she got the abortion: She was an extremely selfish, self-centerd,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; materialistic woman. When I later found out what she did, I cannot say I was at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all surprised, though I was rather bothered by what she did.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the self-centeredness selfishness goes two ways.
