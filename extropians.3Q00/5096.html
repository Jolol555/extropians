Dear List Members
<BR>
<P>Some of these posts are disturbing - I cannot descern sarcasm from factual
<BR>
statement; the women from the righteous males. In short, I cannot believe
<BR>
what I'm reading.
<BR>
<P>As a human who happens to reside in female form, I am most interested in
<BR>
your personal pov on forced-pregnancy and abortion. Perhaps you would be
<BR>
willing to share your feelings and experiences:
<BR>
1. Do you think a female should be forced to endure every pregnancy?
<BR>
2. If so, what should happen to them, that is, mother and child?
<BR>
3. Do you support absolute dominion over one's own body?
<BR>
4. As a female, would you terminate an untimely pregnancy?
<BR>
5. Would you do anything to obtain an abortion? Eg: Travel to another
<BR>
country? Perform it yourself?
<BR>
6. Do you have other comments?
<BR>
<P>Please email me privately.
<BR>
<P>Thank you.
<BR>
