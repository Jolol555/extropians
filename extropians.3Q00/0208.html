<P><EM>&gt; GREG BURCH SAID: &quot;...organizing a well-funded, well-staffed and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  well-equipped clinic and research facility where &quot;wide-open&quot; life extension
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and other transhumanist technology can be carried forward.  I've done quite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a bit of thinking about what would be required, from a legal and business
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  perspective, to accomplish this.  If you're interested, I'd be happy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  discuss it with you....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  CYMM SAYS: I'm interested... theoretically at first. Maybe I'm paranoid; 
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  I see modern technology as having great potential to liberate those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  understand and would have access to it.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Greg, I'd entertain any discussion that does not run too much a risk of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  making me a marked man...
</EM><BR>
<P>We're not at the point yet where we should be worried about becoming marked 
<BR>
men or women.  Of course, that means that this is the time to start thinking 
<BR>
about what we might want to do.  Here are some preliminary thoughts.
<BR>
<P>The scenarios that concern me are those involving medical techniques which 
<BR>
might become possible in the intermediate term that won't be available in 
<BR>
first world countries because of slow, bureaucratic approval processes and/or 
<BR>
fear of backlash from religious or other &quot;bio-conservatives&quot;.  A partial list 
<BR>
of candidates for this kind of thing are:
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Breaking medical techniques or drugs that address specific diseases or 
<BR>
other maladies, such as the vesicular stomatitis virus oncology breakthrough 
<BR>
recently discussed here, or possibly some kind of nerve regeneration therapy 
<BR>
for Alzheimers or treatment of spinal chord injuries;
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Germ line engineering.  I'm aware of one small group that's considering a 
<BR>
kind of germ line therapy that would be completely impossible under FDA rules;
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Bioelectronic interfaces.  Implants for therapeutic purposes (such as 
<BR>
remediation of blindness, hearing loss or motor control), followed by early 
<BR>
implants for purely augmentation purposes (audio inputs, other sensory 
<BR>
enhancements); and
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Somatic cell genetic engineering for purely augmentation purposes.
<BR>
<P>All of these things might be technically possible within the next 5-10 years, 
<BR>
but be practically unavailable outside of small research programs or outright 
<BR>
banned.
<BR>
<P>The physical plant of a clinic where some of this kind of thing could be done 
<BR>
would not necessarily cost a lot to build and maintain.  The real problems 
<BR>
lie in the following areas:
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Staffing:  How do you find the medical doctors and other professionals 
<BR>
and technicians to man such a facility?  The problems are obvious: You want 
<BR>
good people, but anyone involved in such a facility risks loss of 
<BR>
professional credentials and becoming a professional pariah.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Marketing:  How do you promote the services of such a clinic?  This 
<BR>
problem is closely related to the next problem, &quot;Legal Regime&quot;.  Even 
<BR>
assuming the issues in that problem area are solved, will it be legal to 
<BR>
market the clinic's services in the US, Canada, Europe and Japan, the target 
<BR>
areas?  I don't know the answer to that question, but know that answering it 
<BR>
will be expensive.  In any case, to make the effort pay, you'd have to devote 
<BR>
a substantial amount of money to marketing the services of the clinic.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  Legal Regime:  Where can you build the clinic so that it is able to carry 
<BR>
on its operations undisturbed?  The choices are basically two: An island with 
<BR>
a legal regime that will tolerate the clinic, or a ship in international 
<BR>
waters.  I know of a few candidates for the former choice, but a significant 
<BR>
amount of legal research has yet to be done to determine which ones are the 
<BR>
most amenable for siting of such a clinic.  A significant budget would have 
<BR>
to be allocated to in-person contact with officials in more than one 
<BR>
candidate island for negotiation of the right to build and operate the 
<BR>
clinic.  The ship option is very expensive, adding the entirety of maritime 
<BR>
operations to the cost of the clinic, and also adding the need for a home 
<BR>
port that the ship could call at in which it could be serviced without 
<BR>
harassment.  Both options have the problem of customer access.  The islands 
<BR>
that might host a transhumanist clinic are out of the way and not easy to 
<BR>
reach.  A ship operating in international waters requires that customers 
<BR>
travel at least 200 miles offshore for services; a long and uncomfortable 
<BR>
boat ride, or an expensive and risky helicopter or seaplane ride, both 
<BR>
possible only in relatively good weather, and difficult for people with 
<BR>
disabilities.
<BR>
<P>The kinds of services discussed above seem to me to be the best bet for 
<BR>
initial establishment of a &quot;free science&quot; enclave, since other kinds of 
<BR>
technical work toward the transhumanist agenda will likely be possible in the 
<BR>
mainstream research community for somewhat longer.  However, should attempts 
<BR>
be made to ban nanotech, other kinds of bioengineering or AI work be 
<BR>
seriously considered, a &quot;free science&quot; enclave could become a host for such 
<BR>
work, as well.
<BR>
<P>So, to summarize, what I see the need for is 1) a medial breakthrough with 
<BR>
clear value that is banned or taking too long to approve in the developed 
<BR>
world, 2) funding and 3) doctors and researchers with a LOT of guts.  My 
<BR>
guess is that you'd need something in the low to mid $10s of millions to do 
<BR>
such a thing with any chance of success, assuming you could solve the other 
<BR>
problems.
