<EM>&gt; &quot;fundamental&quot; means what they are not willing to consider changing or

<EM>&gt; questioning.  They may even thing that they are unable to question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.  But think one is unable and being unable are not the same thing.

<EM>&gt; I have seen some people some times shift what they and most people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought were fundamental values.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given that fundamental values are the basis upon which a person
<BR>
constructs ver entire world, altering these values would mean a kind of
<BR>
earth-shattering cataclysm. the process would not be gradual; the inner
<BR>
world of the person would simply crumble, leaving ver kicking and
<BR>
screaming, helpless as a newborn ... at least for a while. during this
<BR>
period, years of conditioning beckons this person to reach out for ver old
<BR>
values that have given ver comfort. what kind of motivation (given that
<BR>
this person has no complete value system yet) would keep ver going? 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no, not impossible. but then again, it isn't strictly impossible
<BR>
that water at room temperature and atmospheric pressure would
<BR>
spontaneously boil -- in fact, a few lucky molecules always gather enough
<BR>
thermal energy to do just that. by the same token, fundamental value
<BR>
changes do happen; but afaik, they are almost always the result of some
<BR>
urgent crisis, often beyond the person's control.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If we cannot shift &quot;fundamental&quot; values then it could spell doom for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; race as more and more of the environment those values were formed in and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for changes quite radically and ever faster.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as dna structure is effectively frozen in that adding a fifth
<BR>
type of base would necessitate changing the entire biosphere, so
<BR>
fundamental values are pinned down in that pulling one of these from under
<BR>
would send the entire house of cards tumbling. while a diminishing number
<BR>
of individuals gather enough momentum by sheer chance to complete a 
<BR>
fundamental change, to consciously arrange this for any appreciable number
<BR>
of people would prove prohibitively expensive. to boil the whole pot of
<BR>
water, we need to raise the temperature to 100 degrees.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as to &quot;doom for the race,&quot; i'm sure glad that values aren't
<BR>
inherited like genes.
