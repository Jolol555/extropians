Hello all!
<BR>
<P>A special hello to Samantha Atkins!
<BR>
I remember you attending Eliezer's AI Plan to Singularity session. I
<BR>
already read your messages on the SL4 mailinglist - and I'm very glad
<BR>
you are posting to the ExI mailinglist now as well. 
<BR>
<P>My name is Sabine Atkins. I subscribed the ExI mailinglist since the end
<BR>
of 1998. I met my husband, Brian Atkins, on this list. So far I have
<BR>
been just a lurker (except for very few posts under my maiden name
<BR>
Sabine Stoeckel), but intend to be a more active member in the future.
<BR>
<P>More facts about me: born in Fuerth/Bavaria/Germany, 30 years old, moved
<BR>
to the US in July (immigration process pending), foreign language 
<BR>
correspondent, now switching over to webdev/sysadmin - and one of the
<BR>
directors of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

<EM>&gt; Hi,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Someone asked offline whether I was a new person on the list or a nym of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone else.  For the record I am a new person here and not a 'nym of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself or anyone else and I am not related to Brian Atkins.  I simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the same not-that-uncommon last name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My posts should give some idea of my views.  As I've mentioned I've been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a software hacker/goddess for a couple of decades.  Recently I've joined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Foresight as a Senior Associate.  I've been dreaming of, thinking about,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hacking on the future in one way or another for most of my life.  I live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mainly in my computers, my books, different groups I'm involved with and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a few close friends.  Basic computer nerd pattern.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What else?  The pattern is a bit different in that I have strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; empathic abilities and a deep mystical streak.  I mainly and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; successfully fight the latter these days and don't make that much use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the former.  But at one time I almost decided it was time to junk the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high-tech career and become the first Sister of the Church of the Holy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nanite.  :-)  What can I say?  I have an intermittenly over-active
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God-module.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - samantha
