<P>
I wonder if the &quot;information must be free&quot; advocates
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;include personal data and private communications in their manifesto?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This one does.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, good.  At least your viewpoint is consistent.  I can at least respect
<BR>
that from an intellectual standpoint.  Of course, from a personal
<BR>
standpoint, it gives me the heebie jeebies.  I'm simply not into us becoming
<BR>
one big happy collective, I'm way too autonomous for that.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Well as with any technology, you have to take the good with the bad.  If
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; plan to wait until there is an *absolutely* safe way to upload you brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before you do so, I have a hunch you are going to be waiting a *VERY* long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, yes, of course.  We are all aware that life entails a certain level of
<BR>
risk.  I don't expect perfect solutions, I'd just like to operate within
<BR>
acceptable parameters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;If it becomes possible for me to easily read your mind would you
</EM><BR>
advocate
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;means of protecting -that- information?  Or would you shrug and say,
</EM><BR>
&quot;it's
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;information!  It's like air!  I can't control it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I'd say spread the wealth.  If you learn how to read my mind,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than me demanding that you not do so, I'd rather persuade you to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teach me how to read your mind as well.  That way you have no advantage
</EM><BR>
over
<BR>
<EM>&gt; me.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, this is the hive mind scenario, and as stated I'm very much in favor
<BR>
of the autonomous agent scenario.  Indeed, I believe that there are
<BR>
tremendous advantages to a distributed system of discrete agents pursuing
<BR>
contrasting and collective goals where information is both fluid and
<BR>
static-- where the left hand does not always know what the right hand is
<BR>
doing.  This is a bit dualistic, but I have a belief that most bootstraps
<BR>
are an emergent property of the interference between polar qualities-- in
<BR>
much the same way as complexity and information increase as one approaches
<BR>
the nexus between chaos and order.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; The above sounds oxymoronish to me.  &quot;Frictionless information&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;absolute privacy&quot; seem to be at exact opposite ends of the spectrum to
</EM><BR>
me.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If you can think of a way to pull *that* off you may well convince me.
</EM><BR>
But
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't even begin to imagine how you'd do it.
</EM><BR>
<P>On the contrary, I believe that such a system would very possible, extremely
<BR>
stable and self sustaining.  I actually think that we live in this universe
<BR>
already, with quantum uncertainty (absolute privacy) protecting against
<BR>
determinism whilst a myriad of collapsing waveforms create the sliver of
<BR>
stable reality on which we proceed.
<BR>
<P>Or again, as above, with chaos at one end and order at the other and all
<BR>
sorts of interesting things in between.  I may not be explaining this well
<BR>
but it appears obvious to me that without reference points (controlled
<BR>
information: private nodes) a network of frictionless information rapidly
<BR>
spirals off into pure chaos.
<BR>
<P>There is an argument that I will try to dig up for you that theorizes that
<BR>
we are only intelligent because we don't have complete understanding of our
<BR>
own intelligence.  Having been an actor for seven years I can certainly
<BR>
testify from first hand experience that sometimes when you think about
<BR>
something, you destroy it.  (Again with the uncertainty principle.)
<BR>
<P><P><P>Sorry Zero, this one turned into a bit of a ramble.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure -someone- out there has an inkling of what I'm getting at here.
<BR>
