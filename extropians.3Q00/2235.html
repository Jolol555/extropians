<P>
I'm in the middle of doing some research for some papers and
<BR>
have been glancing through &quot;Entering Space&quot; by Robert Zubrin.
<BR>
<P>(As you may remember, I gave his &quot;Case for Mars&quot; a hearty
<BR>
thumbs up.)
<BR>
<P>I'm only skimming chapters, but extracts include:
<BR>
<P>Re: Nanotech
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;This could lead to the manifestation of systems that would have all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the capabilities of the evil &quot;liquid metal&quot; robot depicted in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movie Terminator 2, ...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;Furthermore, while nanotechnology may not violate any laws of physics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *controllable* self-replicating robots may well violate the laws of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *biology*.  Consider that small replicating micromachines will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unquestionably undergo random alterations, or mutations if you will.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Those mutations that produce strains that reproduce more rapidly will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; swiftly outnumber to insignificance those that don't.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  If humans allow the creation of nanotech with insufficient
<BR>
error-correction-codes (ECC) in designs/programs to allow this to
<BR>
occur, then they get what they deserve.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;... another reason to hold nanorobots suspect--we don't observe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them.  If diamond-geared, self-replicating assemblers could be built,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they would be ideally suited for dispersal across interstellar space
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using microscopic solar sails for propulsion.  If, in the vast sweep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of past time, a single species anywhere in the Milky Way developed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such microautomatons, it long since would have been able to use them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to colonize the entire galaxy.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Blech, Phooey.  All you have to have done is existed for a few million
<BR>
years longer than humans and developed slow-pokey world ships to have
<BR>
colonized the galaxy.  It doesn't take nanotech.  Furthermore, the
<BR>
&quot;nanobot&quot; colonization perspective indicates that he clearly does not
<BR>
understand the possible problems that nanomachinery has with the high
<BR>
radiation fluxes encountered in space.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;... we are driven toward concluding that (a) there is no other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligent life in the galaxy or (b) non-organic nanotechnology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the self-replicating micro-Babbage-robot type described by Drexler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is impossible.  Since we know that the evolution of intelligent life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is posssible, but we do not know that nanotechnology is, I must consider
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (b) the more likely alternative.
</EM><BR>
<P>Great!  Using the Fermi Paradox to explain why nanotechnology is
<BR>
impossible.  Now I've seen everything!  Could there not be a (c)
<BR>
&quot;Nanotech civilizations can observe almost everything, so there is
<BR>
no need to travel&quot;, or (d) &quot;Nanotech civilizations spend their time
<BR>
trying to engineer smaller selves.  They do not interact with
<BR>
pre-limts-of-physics species.&quot; etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;But it's worth some speculation, because if the promise ever does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pan out, programmable self-replicating nanomachines will offer our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; descendents powers of creation limited only by the rate at which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solar flux provides the energy needed to drive work in a given region.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oooops.... Zubrin needs to talk to Von Err about the prospects for
<BR>
diamondoid nanoassembly before &quot;our descendents&quot; are born.  Further
<BR>
he clearly doesn't understand that the limit may not be &quot;power in&quot;
<BR>
(since you can clearly have diamondoid fusion reactors), but &quot;waste heat
<BR>
out&quot;.  The limits are fundamentally how efficient you can make your
<BR>
construction or thought operations and how effectively you can get rid
<BR>
of the heat generated.
<BR>
<P>Re: Dyson shells
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;To date, no Dyson spheres have been observed.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>(Because the searches are primarily still looking at stars!!!  Duh!)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &quot;The 1-AU sphere described in the previous paragraph, if given a shell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just 1 meter thick, would require the mass from 260 disassembled Earths
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to build (and 1 meter is much too thin for it to hold together).  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much solid material is unavailable in the solar system (Jupiter's hydrogen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be useless for construction), and is unlikely to be available to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others. ... the gravity vector almost everywhere on its surface would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point in rather inconvenient directions...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Sigh!  Zubrin (and his reviewers who include a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of aeronautics)
<BR>
clearly haven't read Dyson's responses to letters to his original article.
<BR>
Dyson clearly states that he is not suggesting a &quot;solid sphere&quot;.  (That is
<BR>
why it is better to call them Dyson &quot;shells&quot;.)  Russian papers during the
<BR>
1960's and 1970's (presumably also not reading the letters), e.g.
<BR>
1. &quot;Dyson’s Sphere Is Impossible&quot;, V. D. Davydov,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priroda, XX 64/4 N 11 XI (1963), p.100-101
<BR>
2. Searching for Extraterrestrial Civilizations&quot;, G. I. Pokrovskii,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priroda XX 64/4, N 6:97-98 (1973)
<BR>
proved that solid spheres were impossible.  However, nested layers of
<BR>
orbiting solar power collectors with computers are not impossible.
<BR>
<P>All of Zubrin's subsequent discussion of dismantling Venus to
<BR>
construct a Ringworld or building masses of O'Neill colonies
<BR>
is irrelevant because it assumes Dyson shells are impossible.
<BR>
<P>So, it would appear that Zubrin's perspective argues that only
<BR>
&quot;humans&quot; in their natural form will be the logical explorers
<BR>
of the solar system.
<BR>
<P><P>Dubious in my opinion,
<BR>
