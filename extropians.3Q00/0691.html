I am glad my questions caused such a storm of thinking in Alex Bokov.  I think we all really could benefit from his terrific ideas.

On the subject of collaborative writing, we need an Extropian organizing manual. Not the ideas, which are adequately explained in a huge number ofbooks and web pages, but the answer to a simple question: &quot;What can I, as a non-millionaire and a non-PhD do to help you guys?&quot;
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Natasha has already written a manual on dealing with the mass media if I understand correctly, but I don't think an organizing manual has been done.  Alex is the person for the job, with maybe some colloboration from others!
<BR>
<P>The question, &quot;What can I, as a non-millionaire and a non-PhD do to help you guys?&quot; is so key to the whole idea of such an organizing manual.

1. Someone needs to start an online database of politicians' voting records on technology, funding for basic research, privacy, and civil liberties. Everyone ranging from labor unions to religious groups to one-issue special interest groups publishes a voting guide that assigns ratings to each candidate. I propose that Extropy Institute publish its own voting guide. Okay, big project, lets start smaller. Let's start with California, and if Exers in other states/countries want to be published in the guide, they can send in their own data. 2. Once such a guide is published, contribute money to the campaigns of enlightened candidates. Write good stuff about them. Dig up dirt on their opponents. Vote for them.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Another excellent idea for us to do.  The Christian Coalition does this to great effect.  Starting off in California is the sensible way to start.  I realize even &quot;good&quot; candidates often have major liabilities when seen from the transhumanist viewpoint.  But still, we must at least try.

Local groups. Goal-- bring about a cultural milieau where anybody who feels like bouncing around some ideas about technology and society in person, over some drinks, without having to explain every third word... can find a likeminded individual for such an activity within at most a few hours travel.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I think this is a HUGE thing which could move extropianism/transhumanism forward.  Having &quot;grassroots&quot; organizations scattered all over the U.S. and rest of the world could give extropianism the strength it needs to really influence things.  Again, the Christian Coalition mastered this through church outreach.
<BR>
<P>Also, by having a local extropian/transhumanist group in their area, people feel it is a more important part of their lives.  It goes beyond simply being a mailing list and an occasional conference.  So this could have a really synergistic effect on us.

HELPING PEOPLE. Three obvious classes of charities around which to focus our efforts are first, transhuman/extropian non-profits, second research charities, and third, technology/knowledge transfer efforts to the disenfranchised of both the developed and the developing world.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It would help if the extropian institute had MUCH more money and manpower to donate, but that is where individual members come into play.  Again, I think local groups could get involved in their local communities and on a personal level help others in a way that leaves such a lasting good impression.

2. We have to understand very thoroughly why some distributed projects are interesting enough to motivate volunteers/participants, and others aren't. Might as well start collecting data right now. Please respond to this message with your experiences with projects that you never go into, and projects that gripped you and fascinated you. Give us your best guess as to what they did right and what they did wrong. For the purposes of the above question, this request for testimonials counts as such a project.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I remember Brent Allsop putting forth the idea of a collective database and I hope to see that become a reality.  Besides posting up a storm, we need to actually get things accomplished.  I need to get my own house in order on this one.

Beautiful women who wouldn't give me the time of day normally, gratefully accepting my water pistols. They even intuitively understood what they were for, I didn't have to explain.

<P>Alex is truly a good samaritan to women in need.

Everytime we fight amongst ourselves instead of debating amongst ourselves is a failure. Every time someone wins a flame war instead of the flamewar being diffused with preservation of dignity all around is a failure. Everytime a promising project fades away into neglect because the person who started it felt burned out and had nobody nearby to hand it off to is a failure. Whenever lack of communication or &quot;not made here&quot; syndrome causes us to duplicate someone else's labor instead of adding to it is a failure. Everytime someone comes up with a concrete project, and is met with resounding indifference--not even so much as one constructive criticism-- is a failure.

<P>The line, &quot;everytime someone comes up with a concrete project, and is met with resounding indifference--not even so much as one constructive criticism-- is a failure&quot; really hit me hard.  I have seen that happen a number of times of the list.

I think Waldemar would like us to formulate a clear agenda. WHAT DO WE WANT? - practically, in the next years. I think our list of demands/goals would be something along these lines:* Innovation, research and technology should be free, and must not be controlled or stopped by political or ideological concerns. Dangerous or controversial technology can be handled through other ways than coercion and banning.* Humans should be free, not just along the traditional freedoms but also having morphological freedom - the freedom of altering themselves after their own wishes and abilities.* Society should be open. It must be possible to criticise, analyse and debate all issues, and demand accountability of the people making decisions (be they in the government, big business or the lab).
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Anders has stated our primary objectives so well here!  I think extropians need more than anything to not allow science and technology to be bound and gagged
<BR>
by those who would hold it back in extreme ways.  We must fight to create an evironment where science and civilization can blossom.  I look forward to feedback on these ideas and issues.
