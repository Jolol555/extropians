<P>biotechnology : We can rebuild him
<BR>
DAVID ADAM
<BR>
<P>Artificial skin grows on the scaffold in a matter of days.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen, we can rebuild him, we have the technology&quot;, the makers of the
<BR>
‘bionic man’ famously claimed. Six-million-dollar men remain science
<BR>
fiction, but modern-day researchers are perfecting techniques to build and
<BR>
replace human tissue. Bioengineers in Japan have now developed support
<BR>
materials that could help grow better artificial skin, blood vessels and
<BR>
even vital organs - though telescopic eyes and tank-busting forearms will
<BR>
have to wait.
<BR>
<P>You will not be as lucky as the bionic man if you crash your prototype space
<BR>
vehicle. Artificial skin is the only synthetic tissue currently available to
<BR>
patients, though heart valves, bones and liver tissue have all been grown in
<BR>
laboratories.
<BR>
<P>The new material developed by Guoping Chen and colleagues at Tokyo
<BR>
University, Japan, could offer a better way to make these synthetic body
<BR>
parts. It acts as a three-dimensional scaffold on which cells grow and
<BR>
organise themselves into the desired shape and tissue structure - just as
<BR>
the human skeleton provides support for our bodies. The scaffold then
<BR>
degrades, leaving the fully formed tissue behind.
<BR>
<P>Such scaffolds are not new. They form the basis for artificial tissues
<BR>
throughout the world. But the material developed by Chen’s group offers a
<BR>
step forward that &quot;seems very novel, exciting and could be extremely
<BR>
useful&quot;, says Mathis Riehle, a bioengineer at Glasgow University’s Centre
<BR>
for Cell Engineering, UK.
<BR>
<P><P>The Japanese researchers combine two existing scaffold technologies - the
<BR>
natural polymer collagen and a synthetic polymer mesh. Both have drawbacks:
<BR>
collagen is weak and cells do not grow easily on synthetic polymer surfaces.
<BR>
So the two materials are usually combined to pool their benefits. But such
<BR>
‘hybrids’ restrict cell growth because they either simply coat the polymer
<BR>
chains in collagen or immerse the whole network in a thick collagen gel.
<BR>
<P><P>Chen’s team takes a different approach, as they report in Chemical
<BR>
Communications1. They amalgamate a polymer mesh with collagen sponge. The
<BR>
sponge forms a second mesh inside the holes of the synthetic net - providing
<BR>
greater support for growing cells. Simple but ingenious says Riehle, &quot;it’s
<BR>
quite astonishing that nobody has previously thought of combining these two
<BR>
things.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The new material’s extra strength will be its biggest asset, Riehle
<BR>
predicts. It is almost as strong as conventional polymer meshes, and much
<BR>
more resilient than collagen sponge alone. And it works: skin cells cultured
<BR>
on the new hybrid grow into a connected layer within days, after which both
<BR>
the polymer and collagen degrade.
<BR>
<P>But what works in the laboratory does not always succeed in the body, Riehle
<BR>
cautions. Toxic chemicals used to strengthen the collagen fibres could leak
<BR>
out, he warns. And the apparently rough material surface could make delicate
<BR>
tissue construction difficult.
<BR>
<P>Still, the new material could to offer a simpler and more robust method of
<BR>
making artificial skin and other tissues.
