<EM>&gt; &gt;  Not such a big deal but our tax dollars are supporting such &quot;art.&quot;  Of

<EM>&gt; &gt;  course, this goes for genuine art too.  I don't think anyone should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  forced to support it.  And for those who might think I lack compassion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  I not only buy art (from prints to CDs to poetry books), I do frequent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  museums, theaters, cinemas, galleries, and concerts.  So I support it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  already.  I also see lots of other people doing the same.  Granted, I'm
</EM><BR>
not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  feeding starving artists, but I do my part.  Nothing to brag about,
</EM><BR>
just
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  trying to disarm the highly vocal libertarian-bashers.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Golly Gee Billy Bob, is that ther plaster mule a piece of Gen-yoo-ine Art?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Basher though you think I be, my tax dollars do not support much of the
</EM><BR>
art
<BR>
<EM>&gt; these days, believe me.  The plug has been pulled. Educational art
</EM><BR>
programs?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; yes. Community Outreach programs for impoverished youth? OK. Inner city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revitalization through public performance? Sure...
</EM><BR>
<P>The NEA budget has hardly changed.  I believe they trimmed $1 million off a
<BR>
$200 million budget.  Whoa!  Big, deep cuts!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (If its generously matched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by ten thousand dollars from Sprint, Dole, Citicorp, Budwieser and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Amanson Foundation). But art as Art?  Artists making Art? Money for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ack-tchoo-al artiste, paid to create? noooo....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not any more.
</EM><BR>
<P>But a lot of artists have always gotten little money for their work.  Van
<BR>
Gogh, as we probably have all heard heard, only sold one painting in his
<BR>
entire life.  But this is only looking at one art: painting.  Poets, to use
<BR>
another type of artist, usually don't make a lot of money off their poetry,
<BR>
but usually turn to teaching and translating to make money.  (Robert Howard
<BR>
is one recent example of this.  He teaches at Columbia and translates French
<BR>
literature.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And art is the better for it, IMHO. If I think YOU have a narrow idea of
</EM><BR>
what
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;genuine art&quot; is- imagine what I think of the NEA's ever narrowing, narrow
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viewpoint!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Urk.
</EM><BR>
<P>The NEA's viewpoint, whether narrower or wider, is not germaine in this
<BR>
vein.  What is is that it uses other people's money forcibly taken to fund
<BR>
whatever it likes or thinks the rest of us should like.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't feel forced to pay taxes,
</EM><BR>
<P>Stop paying them and see if there is no force used against you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I like paying taxes, I like to live in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world of free busses, free roads, free schools, good security and public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; parks and beaches.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not free if you're paying for it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Money well spent. I wish I could put more of it towards sculpture gardens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of guns.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would not disagree, but each person should be allowed to choose what he or
<BR>
she funds -- and not be forced by someone who thinks he or she knows better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hey ... but I don't feel that in REALITY Art benefits from National money,
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fact in it's heyday the NEA seemed to generate worse art each year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eventually the system bottomed out and shit hit the fan with the NEA four.
</EM><BR>
If
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you want MY take on that, e-mail me privately, since it involves people I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it funds a little of everything, though the amounts are so trivial,
<BR>
but I think the reason would be artists and the like chase after NEA dollars
<BR>
is the legitimacy it conveys.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; FYI: Most of the money for public art comes from private funding. Rich
</EM><BR>
folks.
<BR>
<P>I know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Philanthropically minded folks with more money to spend than they know how
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; spend it.  Only a tiny bit of the money comes from your taxes (assuming
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; live in the United States) and 99% of 1999 endowments for the arts was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directly from grants: Corporate funders, family trusts, estate endowments
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the like.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know, but any is too much when force is involved.  If some people want to
<BR>
pay for abstract paintings, great.  Fine by me.  Just don't take money from
<BR>
those who would rather not.
<BR>
<P>And outisde the US, conditions are much different.  In 1989, the National
<BR>
Gallery of Canada in Ottawa spent $1.8 million Canadian for a Barnett Newman
<BR>
&quot;painting.&quot;  The creative, mind opening feature of this painting?  A
<BR>
vertical red stripe between two blue stripes!  Yeah, this sounds like the
<BR>
cutting edge of artistic evolution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They are less controlling than Uncle Sam, but not by much.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, it's their money.  At least, I don't have to pay for it.  However, this
<BR>
doesn't mean I can criticize how they spend it.
<BR>
<P>Plus, I think a variant of Gresham's law applies here: fake art drives out
<BR>
real art.  One problem with this culture of non-art being treated as art is
<BR>
a lot of promising art work is ignored or languishes in the basements and
<BR>
wharehouses of museums.  (Most public museums in America do not display all
<BR>
their works in stock, unlike the Louvre.)
<BR>
<P>And, of course, just because someone is paying for it, doesn't make it art.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
