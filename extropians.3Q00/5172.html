<P><EM>&gt; I realize that is not reason enough to claim that it must have been built by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jehovah (Allah, Jesus, fill in the blank).  But some time back, before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big bang, before the first of perhaps almost infinitely many big bangs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there was a *first* cause.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Really?  What if causality itself is a casualty of real understanding of
<BR>
physics?  What if it is just another thing that is true from a certain
<BR>
point of view in rather delimited circumstances.  At the least it is all
<BR>
bound up in that &quot;time&quot; thing which is all bound up with &quot;space&quot; which
<BR>
is actually finite and did not exist in any really meaningful way before
<BR>
the Big Bang inflated it.  
<BR>
<P>If causality was strict then you would get &quot;turtles all the way down&quot;. 
<BR>
You couldn't have an Uncaused Cause.

<P><EM>&gt; Energy is conserved, meaning it is neither created nor destroyed.  Can that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mean that energy and/or matter have *always* existed?  Is that any easier to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe than the story that God has always existed?  Not for me.  Don't get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me wrong, I no longer believe in the God I was taught about in Sunday
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; school.  But in light of the number and fundamentality of the unanswerable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions, I can't see how one could claim with any sort of certainty that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God does not exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>That energy and matter are conserved may also be a local space-time
<BR>
conditon.
