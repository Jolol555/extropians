EUGENE SAYS: &quot;...Did you knew that they've started outlawing free Unices in
<BR>
selected college dorms?..&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: &quot;...WHAT! Are you serious? Please tell me more! You start
<BR>
outlawing things - you create outlaws. Prohibition all over again.
<BR>
<P>EUGENE SAYS: &quot;...I'm not. I don't like where the logics of it all is leading
<BR>
us. There
<BR>
must be a more constructive way out...&quot;
<BR>
<P>CYMM SAYS: Now Eugene, that is tantamount to an act of blind faith. Look at
<BR>
the extant constraints of the 1st decade of the &quot;globalized&quot; 21st century.
<BR>
How potent - how directed - can human governance be under such
<BR>
circumstances?
<BR>
<P>Maybe an individual - or a small group - can take a survivalist stance
<BR>
against hyper AI... but then those activities (...as i interpret the
<BR>
empirical evidence...)  quickly turn into cultthink.
<BR>
<P>That's why I think the whole upload thing is naive (...not the tech behind
<BR>
it mind you) - a human is unlikely to constrain an exhuman and human ethics
<BR>
must necessarily be discarded by posthumans who go the upload way.
<BR>
<P>You can try to Asimov the uploads and their progeny (...enhanced copies,
<BR>
etc) into submission - but in your heart of hearts do you think that &quot;we&quot;
<BR>
could ever contain &quot;them&quot;?
