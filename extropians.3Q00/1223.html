<P><EM>    &gt; Acheiving animal-level intelligence seems to be a much more tractible problem,
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; and it would enable us to build robots good enough to automate almost all
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; physical labor.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not at all certain of that. 40 years ago everybody thought we'd have a robot janitor
<BR>
long before we had a robot chess grand master who can beat any human alive.
<BR>
They were wrong. That tells me that our naive notions about what is easy and what is
<BR>
difficult are wrong. Today's computers don't have much trouble with higher math but with
<BR>
more mundane things like pattern recognition, manual dexterity and that grab bag of skills
<BR>
and knowledge we call common sense.
<BR>
<P>One surprising thing computer science has taught us is that an enormous about of
<BR>
brain power is needed to perform an apparently simple task like moping a floor.
<BR>
How do I pick up the mop? Is that dirt on the floor or is it a shadow? Should I move that
<BR>
obstacle or go around it? How long should I try to get rid of that stain before I give up?
<BR>
In retrospect we shouldn't have been so surprised, mundane stuff like that is essential
<BR>
for survival and evolution wouldn't give us more intelligence than we needed to survive
<BR>
in the jungle.
<BR>
<P>These problems don't seem hard to us because we're very good at them. Natural
<BR>
selection gave a big advantage to those who were good at spotting the pattern
<BR>
of a saber toothed tiger hiding in the bushes, but no advantage to those who
<BR>
were good at solving partial differential equations. It is not mere rhetoric to say
<BR>
that in an absolute sense a janitor has a more intellectually challenging job than
<BR>
a professor of mathematics.
