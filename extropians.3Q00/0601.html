<EM>&gt; Subject: Re: Tipler/Sheldrake

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sheldrake has recently (1999) published a book, [Dogs That Know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When Their Owners Are Coming Home and Other Unexplained Powers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Animals: An Investigation], on these sorts of experiments.  I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be interested in comments if anyone has read it.
</EM><BR>
<P>No comments on Sheldrakes book, but I want to read it.
<BR>
<P>Here are some comments from my own experience:
<BR>
<P>Plants:  Take 2 plants and give them identical care with one exception:  for
<BR>
one of the plants stop by and look at it every day and think (or
<BR>
say--doesn't matter whether you say the words out loud or just think
<BR>
them )nice thoughts such as &quot;How beautiful your flowers are today, with the
<BR>
sunlight shining so delicately pink through their petals!&quot; The plant you
<BR>
stop and appreciate will thrive, whereas the other plant will survive but
<BR>
will be less robust, will have leaves that are less plump, and so forth.
<BR>
Other gardeners have agreed with me and said that they too have noticed
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P>People:  at the moment my cousin Lizzie was killed, 15 miles from where I
<BR>
was, I saw in my mind the vision of a bloody face.  The vision was strong
<BR>
enough that I ran in from the garden to check on my daughter to make sure
<BR>
she was OK.  A couple of hours later, the police came to tell me Lizzie had
<BR>
been killed.
<BR>
<P>Nature of consciousness:  When I was a child I used to run through the woods
<BR>
at night, barefoot.  Even on nights when there was no moon, my feet avoided
<BR>
injury.  The feet themselves seemed to know where to step.
<BR>
<P>But this was a long time ago.  Maybe I'm not remembering accurately.  OK,
<BR>
how about this:
<BR>
<P>I often have the experience of walking through the woods and finding myself
<BR>
suddenly stopping.  Only after I stop does the information make it into my
<BR>
consciousness that if I hadn't stopped I would have skewered one of my eyes
<BR>
on a sharp twig. I read of some research that was done on this topic.  I
<BR>
believe it was about a year ago.  It was done with all the latest gadgets to
<BR>
measure brain waves and all that and seemed to show that consiciousness
<BR>
doesn't work in quite the way it had been thought to.  Messages do not need
<BR>
to run through the brain in order to be acted upon by widely separated parts
<BR>
of the body.
<BR>
<P>I have had other experiences that are far more bizarre and seem to indicate
<BR>
that there is some connection between the mind and what we would think of as
<BR>
inanimate matter, but I don't generally share these in public. They're what
<BR>
you might call over the edge, and I really don't know what to make of them.
<BR>
