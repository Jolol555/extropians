<P>I guess you didn't read what I said. I understand what you are saying.
<BR>
My own father has had repeat battles with a blood infection that swelled
<BR>
up his legs like elephantiasis, and they had to bring out what his doc
<BR>
calls 'the big guns' to finally whip it. What I was saying though, is
<BR>
that if there were resistant strains in the meat, then those strains got
<BR>
resistant due to an incomplete or insufficient treatment of antibiotics
<BR>
IN THE COW (NOT you). So the point is, it suggests the farmer is not
<BR>
giving the cow a sufficient dose of anti-biotics to wipe out the
<BR>
bacteria, NOT that its wrong he's giving them it at all.
<BR>
<P><P>Sorry Mike, but you dont know what you're talking about.  The more
<BR>
antibiotics you use the more likely the bacteria will develop resistance.
<BR>
Anti-biotic resistant strains of bacteria do not arise because the bacteria
<BR>
adapt to a low level of antibiotic in their environment.  The strain arises
<BR>
because some of the population are already resistant to that antibiotic and
<BR>
it is their offspring which survive in that environment.  Giving cows more
<BR>
antibiotics would make the situation worse, not better.
