No the planets are not in our solar system.  They are around
<BR>
other stars within a couple of hundred light years.  I believe
<BR>
we are up to 50 planets and either 2 or 3 planetary systems.
<BR>
Lowest mass is slightly under Saturn (except maybe for those
<BR>
orbiting around the pulsar).  Orbits are mostly fairly eliptical,
<BR>
which to some extent is a selection effect (because large
<BR>
Jupiters with orbits close to the star will be discovered
<BR>
first in these surveys).  To get Jupiters close to stars,
<BR>
you are likely to have had planetary billiards occuring
<BR>
which is likely to create more elliptical orbits. I am
<BR>
*hoping* as time goes by, we will get more circular orbits.
<BR>
If that doesn't occur, then opportunities for life are
<BR>
going to take a significant hit.
<BR>
<P>Good article in the Sept. 2000 Discover on how it may be raining
<BR>
diamonds on Neptune That is the current theory on why it radiates
<BR>
2.6x as much heat as it receives from the sun (rain induced friction).
<BR>
*Or* you could think about it another way...  Lets see -- a very large
<BR>
planet with the highest fraction of methane in its atmosphere.  What is
<BR>
methane?  CH4...  Hmmmm.... Split that and you can make lots of
<BR>
diamondoid thermonuclear reactors to burn the H in...  If the
<BR>
heat isn't waste heat from the thermonuclear reactors of the
<BR>
Neptune brain, and it *is* raining diamonds, God, what a waste...
<BR>
<P>Martin, if you have access to Excel and still want a spreadsheet of
<BR>
more materials properties than you want to know, let me know
<BR>
and I send you one.
<BR>
<P>I'm not a big fan of Gold's theories.  If I remember he argues
<BR>
that the oil is deep, which means that it is going to be expensive
<BR>
to extract.  EvMick is right in that there is a lot of underutilized
<BR>
farmland out there, that *should* be growing synfuel or synplastic
<BR>
so the U.S. can fix our balance of payments deficit.  And I would
<BR>
call &quot;permaculture&quot; the greenhouses that are used when the return
<BR>
justifies building the infrastructure.  In Seattle my winter/spring
<BR>
vegetables come from hot houses in British Columbia.  In Moscow, I see
<BR>
tons of flowers in the middle of winter.  I'm fairly sure they come from
<BR>
greenhouses as well.  So Mike, if you get the price of gas up to
<BR>
$5-$10/gallon, I'm sure you will see greenhouses sprouting up
<BR>
all over the place or oil-apple orchids being planted.  The
<BR>
fundamental problem with agriculture as currently practiced
<BR>
is that much of it uses annual plants.  Erosion isn't as
<BR>
much of a problem in orchids and your yields will be higher
<BR>
because you don't have to regrow the much of the plant that
<BR>
isn't used every year.
<BR>
<P>Brian, I'm currently off the list while attempting to
<BR>
finish some of my work of the last several years, so I can
<BR>
reorient myself to head in new directions this fall.
<BR>
I still browse the archives from time to time, but am
<BR>
not likely to see everything, if you have something
<BR>
specific you think requires my attention, feel free to
<BR>
cc: me.  Thanks for asking.
<BR>
<P>Robert
