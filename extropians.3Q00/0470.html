I read the book last year. These fellows are very bright and Bradbury's 
<BR>
observation that they gave Tipler short-shrift, is accurate but 
<BR>
understandable. Back in 1996 Adam's and Laughlin announced their 'open 
<BR>
universe' evidence at a scientific meeting, and have staked years of research 
<BR>
to establish this as the primary theory-which it is.  Having said that, I see 
<BR>
too much contrary work, by good scientists to crown these guys, or even 
<BR>
Perlmutter, with the crown of absolute truth. Not yet anyway.

<P>&lt;&lt; While in France last week, I finished reading
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Five Ages of the Universe&quot;,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Fred Adams and Greg Laughlin, Touchstone, 1999
<BR>
&nbsp;which is a comprehensible interpretation of the hard-physics paper Anders
<BR>
&nbsp;first mentioned (and I subsequently referenced) regarding the evolution
<BR>
&nbsp;and eventual end of the universe.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;The good news is the book is very readable and pretty optimistic
<BR>
&nbsp;for future possibilities.  We can clearly get through the stelliferous
<BR>
&nbsp;era (10^14 years), and if dark matter is real, probably the degenerate
<BR>
&nbsp;era (10^39th years), though at a much reduced computation rate, and
<BR>
&nbsp;perhaps even the black hole era (10^100 years).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;They fail to delve into the possibilities SIs &quot;saving&quot; hydrogen
<BR>
&nbsp;for controlled burning after the stelliferous era, or SI engineering
<BR>
&nbsp;to prevent the proton decay of the degenerate era, or what happens
<BR>
&nbsp;if there is no &quot;real&quot; dark matter.  However, they make up for it with
<BR>
&nbsp;a fairly wild scheme for building computers out of black holes
<BR>
&nbsp;(though they compute pretty slowly...).  They even toss a coin or two
<BR>
&nbsp;at generating escape universes.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;They also dump a fair amount of cold water on contracting universes,
<BR>
&nbsp;have only a single reference for Tipler and don't discuss the
<BR>
&nbsp;Omega-point Theory at all, presumably being unworthy of consideration
<BR>
&nbsp;given our current knowledge of the universe.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Though I haven't read the entire Omega-point discussion, I'd urge
<BR>
&nbsp;those people who have a problem with it to have people read this book.
<BR>
&nbsp;It rests on a hard-core physical view of the universe as it is currently
<BR>
&nbsp;perceived today (with only some &quot;minor&quot; stretching vis-a-vis the dark
<BR>
&nbsp;matter and lifetime of the proton [for which only theoretical arguments
<BR>
&nbsp;currently exist]).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;If future editions get extended to include some of the concepts we
<BR>
&nbsp;frequently discuss, then we will have a nice framework on which to
<BR>
&nbsp;rest many extropian perspectives.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;I'd urge adding this book to the EI booklist as &quot;approved&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;reading material.
