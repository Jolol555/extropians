<P>
For a long time, I have followed a policy of not discussing religious
<BR>
matters online.  This is because my family is Orthodox Jewish - they
<BR>
believe in the literal truth of the Old Testament - and for many years
<BR>
it has been necessary for me to conceal from them my real beliefs. 
<BR>
Today I sent them an email informing them that I am not, in fact,
<BR>
Jewish.
<BR>
<P>For those of you who are curious about the history of the break, I am
<BR>
proud to say that my religious disagreements began at the age of five. 
<BR>
I was spared the painful break, the sudden crisis of conscience from
<BR>
faith to reason, that often characterizes such transitions; when I was a
<BR>
child, people tried to sell me blatantly ridiculous concepts - like
<BR>
praying in a language you don't understand, or the idea that two
<BR>
contradictory opinions can both be correct - and I wouldn't buy them,
<BR>
although I wasn't allowed to say so.  I never trusted Authority over my
<BR>
own perceptions - not at age five, and not at any age.  And I'm proud of
<BR>
it.
<BR>
<P>I don't remember the exact age when I crossed over from believing that
<BR>
Judaism had accumulated flaws to believing that Judaism was outright
<BR>
wrong, but I do recall that at the age of fourteen I believed that
<BR>
Judaism was just another memetically generated religion.  But I still
<BR>
had to follow all the rules.  If you've been wondering why it's only in
<BR>
the past month that you've seen any posts from me between Friday night
<BR>
and Saturday night, it's because Jews aren't allowed to use computers on
<BR>
the Sabbath.  So it's been a very long nightmare indeed that has just
<BR>
ended.
<BR>
<P>I would like to thank the six people who knew, and kept, my secret:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Atkins
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sabine Stoeckel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Voss
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise Gold
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha Vita-More
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max More
<BR>
<P>It helped a lot to be able to talk to someone, even for just a few
<BR>
hours.  (Everyone I knew in Chicago was also Jewish.)
<BR>
<P>I would also like to thank Damien Broderick, who met my father at the
<BR>
1999 Worldcon, and was aware that my family was Orthodox Jewish, but
<BR>
agreed not to raise the topic.  I don't know if Damien guessed the
<BR>
truth, but I wouldn't be at all surprised.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.
