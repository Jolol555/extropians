I learned to type sitting on the floor in front of the family TV, on a
<BR>
commodore 64 with a really poor keyboard. Now I have a bad back and failing
<BR>
vision. Anyway, I tried to learn touch typing many years later, and just
<BR>
could not; I tried for some months before throwing in the towel. My typing
<BR>
is fast enough for my purposes, but my hands, whilst typing, look like a
<BR>
squid having an epileptic fit after someone has tried to tied it into
<BR>
several pretsel shapes.
<BR>
<P>I wish decent voice recognition would come together. I've made a really
<BR>
serious stab at using IBM's Via Voice in the last couple of months;
<BR>
hopeless.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I took a semester of typing in high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;school, which was a couple years before the broad transistion away from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;typing classes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I took several semesters of typing in high school.  Everyone thought i was
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; little strange...but hey....i was generally the only guy in a class of
</EM><BR>
maybe
<BR>
<EM>&gt; thirty girls......it was fun.(the old UnderWood and olevetti manuals...if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you typed TOO fast they got all hung up.....)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since then I've come to regard typing as the most useful if not most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important thing that i acquired from High School.
