<P><EM>&gt; But isn't it inconsistent to have a blanket statement that abortion is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethical while infanticide is not?  A baby one day from being born can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be killed, while a baby one day after being born cannot?  There is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a clean line between these two cases.  Birth is a process, not an event.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is the tension which drives the search for a better solution.
</EM><BR>
<P>Many humans have difficulty proceeding in the face of this ambiguity.  With
<BR>
this issue we are presented with a moral continuum, over which the act of
<BR>
termination appears to become increasingly &quot;wrong.&quot;  We seem to want to have
<BR>
a single answer-- an absolute rule, rather than an algorithm.  Yes, no,
<BR>
black, white, is it a 'right' act or a 'wrong' act?
<BR>
<P>The ambiguities are not going to go away.
<BR>
<P>We simply need less static ethos by which to navigate them.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, law books are predicated on static ethos.  This necessitates
<BR>
the writing of more and more laws to cover specific contingencies.
<BR>
<P>Ideally we would have a 'utility machine.'  Push a button on its side and it
<BR>
extrapolates the consequences of a particular action out over a reasonable
<BR>
time frame and spits out a little hedonistic ticker: %pleasure, %pain, or
<BR>
some such.
<BR>
<P>In the absence of such predictive power, we might need to start thinking
<BR>
about ways to reconcile ourselves to moral grayness.
<BR>
<P><P>I have a question-- to avoid the growth of increasingly fine grained
<BR>
rule-sets, we might look toward algorithmic approaches to create legal
<BR>
frameworks.  I wonder if list members have ideas about what form those
<BR>
algorithms might take?
