<EM>&gt; &gt; As I understand it, you don't have to charge money to violate copyright,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; just damage the author's ability to make money from their work by it's use.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This isn't true. You have to be actively charging money for providing others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the specific enjoyment of its use and NOT paying Metallica or its record
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company a royalty. Playing Metallica in your backyard for a cookout is not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; violation of copyright, even though your use of their CD in providing free music
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to other people who might not own their CD.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it's not quite that simple (laws never are, and IP laws are much
<BR>
worse).  &quot;Public performance&quot; can be an infringement, and charging
<BR>
money or not is not the deciding factor.  A court decides on a case-
<BR>
by-case basis.  Playing an album at your party is probably okay, even
<BR>
if you charged for entrance.  But waiters singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to
<BR>
customers is not--that has been ruled an infringement of the copyright
<BR>
to that song owned by the estate of the Smith sisters, who zealously
<BR>
pursue such infringements of the copyright--no doubt to encourage the
<BR>
production of more creative work by their dead ancestors.
<BR>
<P>If you think &quot;I'm not making money&quot; is an excuse, put up a fan
<BR>
website for a popular movie or TV show and see what happens.
<BR>
