<EM>&gt; &gt;  because as far as I see it, the primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problem with such system (socialism) is that the threat of force causes underlings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to lie when feeding information up the line, and the pressure of propaganda needs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mandate that the leadership lie about both the acheivements of the last five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years, and the goals of the next five years...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree with you on this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There is also the problem of perceptions of value. The market works because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; allows parties to negotiate a common sense of value. Any system that allows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; parties to freely negotiate common perceptions of value is, by definition, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; free market system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also true as long as *individuals* remain the focus of such transactions.  But what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I see happening are large numbers of individuals being controlled by small numbers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through the traditional hierarchy of corporations.  If this is not the case, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why is it that less than 5% of any company dictates and controls policy while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other 95% have to *obey* or get fired.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i.e.  Corporation = Dictatorship.  I challenge anyone to say otherwise.  Sure I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are a *few* exceptions.
</EM><BR>
<P>A corporate CEO, chairman, or president is held accountable by the board of
<BR>
directors (i.e. congress) who themselves are held accountable by the
<BR>
stockholders (the body of voters).
<BR>
<P>If a corporation is a dictatorship, then so is every 'democratic' society that
<BR>
ever existed, and there is no such thing as democracy.
<BR>
<P>An employee has the choice whether or not to be a voter, by buying stock, just
<BR>
as every citizen of a democratic country is free to choose whether or not to
<BR>
vote. Is the elected president of a country a dictator simply because some part
<BR>
of the population decides not to vote?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Is this in fact the optimum system? As far as the individuals are concerned,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; based on their self interest, yes (except for those individuals who think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; negotiation = getting screwed). As far as the long term best interest of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individuals, this is debatable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again I disagree with this.  I want to use Napster and so does another 25 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people.  Sorry, but those running the corporations and in this case we are talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about less than 1000 people have decided that we can not.  The way I see it, if law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is imposed on a majority by a minority as in the case of Napster, then you have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing less than a Corporate Dictatorship using the government as its strong-arm.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Where is the individual transaction in this case?  From where I'm sitting, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could give a damn about the individual, only profits matter now.
</EM><BR>
<P>No. What you seem to want is a mobocracy, where total democracy reigns, and the
<BR>
rights of no individual is beyond elimination by a simple vote of the majority
<BR>
(or even a vote of x number of people who want to do something, which would be a
<BR>
lynchocracy). Sorry, we are not that sort of society. The majority is
<BR>
constrained by the rights of the individual that are protected by supermajority
<BR>
limitations. Don't like it? Go elsewhere if you want to steal other people's
<BR>
work.
