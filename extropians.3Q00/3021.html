<P>
I'd like to make a toast to Greg Burch -- 
<BR>
<P>A person who has made profound contributions toward enhancing
<BR>
the legal, historical and aesthetic minds of extropians.  I admire
<BR>
you because you are an artistic gardener, an explorer of environments,
<BR>
a knowledgeable history buff, a masterful lawyer, a loyal friend,
<BR>
a person of enormous feelings and compassion, and last, but not
<BR>
least, a tall drink of water.
<BR>
<P>Long life to you!
<BR>
<P>Natasha
<BR>
<P>P.S. &quot;Toasts and the custom of toasting have been around for
<BR>
thousands of years. Some even claim that toasting is only a day
<BR>
or two younger than drinking itself. In fact, one toasting historian
<BR>
(yes, there really are toasting historians) says a primitive
<BR>
form of toasting dates back thousands of years to nomadic tribes
<BR>
who splattered a few drops of drink on sacrificial altars to
<BR>
appease the hunting gods. 
<BR>
<P>The word “toast,” as applied to drink, has its roots in the 1600s
<BR>
when it was common to toss in a piece of bread or crouton into
<BR>
one’s beverage as flavoring... mmmm. According to historian Paul
<BR>
Dickson, the first application of the word occurred in Bath,
<BR>
England in 1709. As the story goes, a “noted beauty” of that
<BR>
fair city was seen bathing in public, when an admirer—so taken
<BR>
by her loveliness—filled a cup with the bathwater and drank it
<BR>
in her honor! Soon after, another admirer (admittedly half-cocked)
<BR>
declared his admiration for the lady, but his revulsion for the
<BR>
bath water. So, instead, he offered to eat the toast in her honor.
<BR>
And thus, the term stuck. 
<BR>
<P>For the Politically Correct:
<BR>
It should be noted that almost as long as people have been toasting
<BR>
one another, there have been those who believed the custom was
<BR>
nothing more than an excuse for debauchery. In fact, Charles
<BR>
the Great, Maximilian, Charles V, and even Louis XIV all enacted
<BR>
harsh penalties against the practice of toasting. The custom
<BR>
was even made illegal in colonial Massachusetts. (It was repealed
<BR>
eleven years later due to the law being largely ignored.) 
<BR>
<P>So frown upon it if you will... but the time-honored practice
<BR>
of toasting appears to be here to stay.&quot;
