<P>
Jamiro2002, I am disgusted by and personally offended by your allegations.

<EM>&gt; A similar misguided aplication of tolerance concerns violations against
</EM><BR>
children. A child is by nature weaker than an adult, is however at the same
<BR>
time tomorrow's adult and therefore the future of humanity. Any violation
<BR>
against children therefore potentially disrupts evolution in a way that
<BR>
should no longer happen based on traits developed in humans. It is one thing
<BR>
for a lion to eat the pups of a rivalling male - but the fact of humans
<BR>
having transcended this need is part and parcel of their very humanity.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is my point? I know from personal research that several extropians or
</EM><BR>
transhumanists are guilty of sexually abusing children (Keith Henson, for
<BR>
example), and I recently came across a persistent rumor that the same is
<BR>
true of Max More (incidentally a friend of Henson?) as well. For obvious
<BR>
reasons as outlined above, I do not consider this to be their private
<BR>
business. But I have so far failed to see reactions or statements from any
<BR>
extropians on this subject, which I consider a moral omission.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any comments?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please do not consider this post a flame, because it is not. It is a
</EM><BR>
factual - though critical -  inquiry, based on my sincere view that a
<BR>
subject's advance will be hampered by deficencies in credibility and
<BR>
trustworthyness of its exponents, and therefore deserves an honest answer.
<BR>
The future can not be approached without dealing with present issues that
<BR>
might bar the road to it.
