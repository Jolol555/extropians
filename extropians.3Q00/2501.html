<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; modified  organisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You made the initial comparison with H-bombs ...... I only point out that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the dangers are more subtle and we should tread carefully.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I compared YOUR fears and level of alarmism to similar levels of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alarmism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about nuclear power and nuclear war. I did NOT compare GM to H-bombs. Please
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; re-read what I posted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sellafield, three mile island, chernobyl .... need i go on? surely the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;alarmist&quot; fears about nuclear power have been born out?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sellafield? Nothing. TMI? Not one fatality. Chernobyl? A system purposely
<BR>
overloaded with all safety systems turned off, as some sort of stupid 'test' by
<BR>
your socialist buddies. The lesson of Chernobyl is that socialists can't be
<BR>
trusted with nuclear power. THe lesson of TMI is that US nuclear plants are safe
<BR>
systems even under the worst failure conditions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is more like a forest fire, which it is possible to fight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;and contain and eliminate (much as we have eliminated smallpox and other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;diseases).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, but even forest fires are harmful .... and aren't some diseases (TB?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that were once thought to have been eliminated fighting back?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;They fight back where people don't actually give them a good fight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Resistant TB
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;strains evolved specifically because people with TB, in their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; characteristic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;lack of attention to detail, stopped taking the antibiotics when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;feeling better, rather than completing the entire regimen of antibiotics as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;instructed by their doctors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But unlike forest fires &amp; disesases .... we are deliberately introducing GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strains into the environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Which has shown tons of evidence that it is perfectly safe there. Humans have
<BR>
been introducing genetically modified agricultural species into the environment
<BR>
for millenia. The only difference between then and now is then we were rolling
<BR>
the dice with the genes in our breeding programs, while now we have a very exact
<BR>
idea of what we are getting. Its quite clear that GE programs are far safer than
<BR>
the hybridization programs humans have been running for thousands of years.
<BR>
Anyone who knows ANYTHING about agriculture knows that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There are no remote mountains or whatever in the UK that can be freed of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bees, even if there might be in the States. But surely other insects move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pollen about as well as bees?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;None do to the same extent, though butterflies are pretty good, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hummingbirds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;are also, but these do not deal with corn. Corn's overwhelmingly primary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; method
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of pollination is by wind.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the safety of tests *can't* be guaranteed then?
</EM><BR>
<P>Nothing in life is guarranteed. Get out of your cradle and give up the safety
<BR>
blankee. Mommy ain't nursing you no more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, so you question the motives of &quot;greenies&quot; who may have left-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; politics. But for sure the motives of Monsanto and the big agri-businesses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pushing this GM thru as fast they can *ARE* motivated solely by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; self-interest and financial gain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is your reply to this point?
</EM><BR>
<P>How do you know what their interests are? Their stockholders are interested in
<BR>
making money, surely, or else they would not be investing in those companies. I
<BR>
fail to see why such an obviously obsolete socialist argument needs any reply,
<BR>
at least on this list.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;What is permaculture?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately there aren't big agri bucks to be made out permaculture ....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although apparently NY city could be self-sufficient in food if it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introduced in the city limits! Its real benefits would be if introduced in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developing countries, but isn't an instant fix, takes a while to establish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ... but after that, easy street.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is your answer to the question, though??? What is permaculture?
