<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Who's calling for keeping stocks white?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I want an outer sheath, like a mullato warm bronze
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with eyes a glimmering—hair a shimmering sterling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have been thinking of a very white surface, pure like an unwritten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paper, with slashes of bright primary colors at strategic places.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;then again, I would probably change my skin as often as I change
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;screensaver when I get a new computer, until settling for something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;simple and discreet. Hmm, maybe a cellular automaton skin...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
But if you're uploaded, then you can be anything you want in cybereality - 
<BR>
or anything that other people will accept.  Imagine now, however, a 
<BR>
transitional mixed phase that will likely happen during the next decade:
<BR>
<P>Virtual fashions - If you're viewing an &quot;overlaid reality,&quot; with resolution 
<BR>
exceeding retinal, with ads, explanations, subject notes, pointers, etc., at 
<BR>
your discretion, superimposed on your visual, auditory or other sensorial 
<BR>
field, then why limit your appearance to the merely photonic image?  As this 
<BR>
wave progresses from gaming and informative overlays via SVGA level headsets 
<BR>
- now available - to full 3D+, then you can superimpose your entire mindset 
<BR>
upon every interaction, and everyone will see you differently.
<BR>
<P>Not just a simple extropolation to being a fire-breathing dragon or John 
<BR>
Wayne or the Goddess Eris, but an entire mind-world projected thru whatever 
<BR>
level of connection other interactees are willing to accept.  Who cares then 
<BR>
how many legs you project, or what texture your skin or scales might be?  
<BR>
It's the whole artistic entity, the extropersona that counts.
<BR>
<P>Imagine your attention level automatically feeding back to your interaction 
<BR>
software so that just as now you focus your eyes without thinking about it, 
<BR>
in that future the image connected with another persona - who may or may not 
<BR>
be physically present - expands and deepens in meaning from an icon or 
<BR>
silouette (sp?) to whatever level of information is mutually satisfactory.  
<BR>
You go from a glance to suddenly seeing the life story and the projected 
<BR>
role they write for themselves, love at first sight for real.
<BR>
<P>Of course, verification is another story...
