Milliways, the

the

going

occured.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from the Hitch
<BR>
Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this:
<BR>
<P>The history of every major Galactic civilization tends to pass through three
<BR>
distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and
<BR>
Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why, and Where phases.
<BR>
<P>For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question &quot;How can we
<BR>
eat?&quot;, the second by the question &quot;Why do we eat?&quot; and the third by the
<BR>
question, &quot;Where shall we have lunch?&quot;
<BR>
<P>The menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the
<BR>
Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third
<BR>
question.&quot;
