<EM>&gt; &gt;I have a sense that many here have similar small libraries; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we so unusual to other people?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Absolutely.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A majority of Americans will even admit in polls that they don't read a
</EM><BR>
book
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a year.  People who actively read amount to at most a couple percent of
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; population.  This is confirmed by the orders of magnitude between readers
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; a bestseller and the number of viewers of a hit tv show.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem, though, is Is this a trait people on this list have a monopoly
<BR>
on?  I reckon not.  I know many non-transhumanists with decent sized
<BR>
libraries.  Heck, a few of these might even be considered
<BR>
anti-transhumanist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm admittedly a hypertrophic case but my guess is that the smallest
</EM><BR>
library
<BR>
<EM>&gt; amongst us exceeds the average for self-described avid readers.
</EM><BR>
<P>Guilty as charged!:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Why?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I get two reactions from people who hear about my books:  envy (from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones who read books) and questions (from thems that don't).  The second
</EM><BR>
most
<BR>
<EM>&gt; common question I'm asked (after the inane &quot;Have you read all of them?&quot;)
</EM><BR>
is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Why don't you just take them out of the library?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I get the same.  I never answer such questions.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because the library doesn't have them.  We all have broad and esoteric
</EM><BR>
interests,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.  Implicit in being extropian.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not just that.  Library books have to be returned.  Until my memory is
<BR>
perfect, i need many of the more technical volumes for reference.
<BR>
<P>But it is that too -- libraries not having them.  While the average public
<BR>
library has more volumes than me, in terms of the subjects I'm mainly
<BR>
interested in, especially higher mathematics, the average library I've been
<BR>
too has less of these than mine.
<BR>
<P>As for books in general, they're neat, but I don't fetishize them.  It's
<BR>
their information I enjoy, not the physical act of handling or smelling
<BR>
them.  (Not that I'm some kind of antisensualist.  I definitely like
<BR>
physical acts of other sorts.:)
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
