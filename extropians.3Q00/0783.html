<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, point being, most were invented in nations without economic

<EM>&gt; &gt; restriction. I assume that all of the above answers you gave were also

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hmm, I forgot to list gunpowder, from restricted China.
</EM><BR>
<P>China's 'gunpowder' is merely the most extensively proven source. There is also
<BR>
the use of 'greek fire' which long predates any Chinese evidence, and which has
<BR>
about the same level of or lack of chemical similarity. Then there was the
<BR>
development of nitrocellulose (also known as guncotton or 'smokeless powder')
<BR>
which is a product of treatment of cotton or wood pulp with nitric acid. While
<BR>
the British originated guncotton for use in cannon, it was not stabilized for
<BR>
commercial use in small arms until the late 1800's in the US. 'Gunpowder', a
<BR>
product of charcoal, sulphur, and saltpeter, has not been used in any
<BR>
significant military extent since the US Civil War, and has not been used in
<BR>
personal defense applications since prior to WW I.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most of Damien B.'s items weren't invented in nations as we use the term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today.  And 'without economic restriction' really needs qualification.  His
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early examples probably came from societies with a social obligation to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; redistribute food surpluses, otherwise known as primitive famine insurance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Or not even famine.  Hunting can be a matter of luck as well as skill.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But yes, socialist countries aren't known for their high inventiveness.  China
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't get far with the gun.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I can't verify that for sure. I think if I'd asked for inventions confined
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the 20th century, and you gave answers which were completely honest, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; most 1 of the 5 would be invented in a socialist leaning nation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I think a nation like Australia or Canada, nations with mixed economies (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But most economists would not call Australia or Canada socialist, and would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call the United States (and Japan) mixed.  Japan has a ministry of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technological development, remember, although I don't know what MITI has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; involved in.  And much of the United States' advantage (besides size and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having wars fought on its own soil) comes from the university system, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; receives quite a lot of government support.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Internet was a military research project, remember, and funded by DARPA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and university money for a long time.  The New Economy has its roots in gov't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nurturing.
</EM><BR>
<P>DARPANET was a military communications project, which no longer exists. The
<BR>
nodes which made up Darpanet numbered in the hundreds, where the current
<BR>
internet numbers in the hundreds of millions, most all of which is privately
<BR>
funded. Saying the US Govt is responsible for the internet, rather than private
<BR>
industry, is like saying that the Wright Brothers are responsible for the SR-71.
<BR>
The US Gov't didn't get the idea for the darpanet until a private contractor
<BR>
lobbied DARPA and the Senate DISC (Defense Intelligence Subcommittee) to fund
<BR>
the project.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; More generally, if you ask for inventions confined to the 20th century, none
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of them will come from nations without economic restriction, if you let that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; include tariffs, high income taxes, and safety nets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; am making an assumption that this describes Astralia, less of an assumption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with Canada) would progress very slowly if not for the innovations of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And size isn't insignificant.  Saying the US produces more inventions than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Canada and Australia isn't surprising.  We do happen to dwarf the population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of any other Western nation.  Plus their economies have largely coalesced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around exporting raw materials to larger countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>The European Union has over 300 million people, 50 million more than the US, so
<BR>
they should be responsible for at least 20% more inventions than the US.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I'm sure there are people on this list who would call the United States
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialist, although I'd call them nuts.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would call some states in the US socialist, or at least social democracies,
<BR>
while others are far from such status. The socialist states in the US maintain
<BR>
their socialist policies without goin broke by federalizing as much of the
<BR>
expense for their socialist policies as possible, thus putting a large percent
<BR>
of the burden for their sytems on people that live in non-socialist states via
<BR>
federal taxation and redistribution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There may be a lot of great inventions floating around in Australia, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without the marketing and corporate aspect, they're not going to find a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; place in the everyday life of most people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the meantime those nasty European socialists seem to be enjoying better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cell phones than we do.  I think Japanese mobile data is even more advanced,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; judging by Wall Street Journal articles.  They were 18 months ahead of Europe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who were 18 months ahead of the United States.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Note I'm not arguing that socialism works or that markets are bad.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simplistic black-and-white labelling gets my goat.
</EM><BR>
<P>The cell phone phenomenon is more a matter of what does the job sufficiently.
<BR>
The US is hampered by its large area, thus increasing the cost per user for the
<BR>
cell infrastructure, and is why such a large percent of the US population does
<BR>
not use cell phones (I don't, and while they seem neat, I don't expect to need
<BR>
one until I get a cell modem on a laptop, and until they extend cell service up
<BR>
to where my fishing cabin is located in northern NH).
