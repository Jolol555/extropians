I think you rephrased it very nicely, Robin.  I doubt not the fact/value 
<BR>
distinction generally but rather only with regard to particular invocations 
<BR>
of high-level values.  At the fundamental level of arational preferences, I 
<BR>
think the distinction holds up.  I also agree, therefore, that disagreements 
<BR>
arise primarily over facts--but with this caveat:  To say that people share 
<BR>
values does not at all necessitate the conclusion that they will live 
<BR>
together without conflict.  Given the sort of self-centered values that 
<BR>
humans arationally hold, quite the contrary holds true.  I value my own 
<BR>
social status, my own pleasure/pain maximization, my own reproductive 
<BR>
success, and so forth.  My neighbors value theirs.  Put us in a world of 
<BR>
limited resources and . . . voila: conflict.
<BR>
<P>I here use &quot;conflict&quot; to distinguish that sort of fight over resources from 
<BR>
&quot;disagreements,&quot; or fights over ideas.  But that's an on-the-fly taxonomy 
<BR>
that probably does not do as well as more carefully considered accounts and 
<BR>
may not hold up at all upon closer scrutiny.  (Hey, what do you want?  It's 
<BR>
email!)

<EM>&gt; What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;seem like values almost always represent positions held only contingent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;certain factual assumptions.  Take, for example, valuing &quot;the environment.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Though proponents of environmentalism often present it as a per se good,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;in truth accept certain claims--industrialism increases human suffering,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;ecosystems exist in balanced harmony absent human intervention, population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;growth increases pollution, and so forth--that may or may not be facts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;at a very fundamental, arational level--seek social status, maximize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pleasure/pain ratios, reproduce, and so forth--do values not rely on beliefs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;about facts.  And at that level, almost everyone agrees.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;T. appears at first to reject the fact/value distinction, but as far as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tell then embraces it as holding at a fundamental level.  And I agree that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decision making often uses multiple levels of beliefs, where beliefs at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;level are built on beliefs from the level below, and that beliefs above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;base level are often mixtures of facts and values.  If every disagreement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a higher level can be traced to disagreements about lower level beliefs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;however, then it seems we can still talk about how much a disagreement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;due to facts versus values.  In principle, we just trace disagreements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the fundamental level belief disagreements they are due to, and see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much of those are values versus facts.  And given T.'s last statement,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems that T. thinks most disagreements are about facts, presumably including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;our disagreements with opponents.
