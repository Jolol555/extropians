<EM>&gt; Encoding &quot;big antlers&quot; is more like encoding symphonies in

<EM>&gt; heartbeats than encoding a heart, and to do that you have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know a lot about the heart and a lot about music.  A useful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutation occurring within the brain (at that level) has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be at least several orders of magnitude less likely than in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organs, limbs, and so on.  (And impossible if you think the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain is just one big &quot;pattern catcher&quot;.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it ain't just one big pattern-catcher.  We *know* it isn't a big
<BR>
pattern-catcher.  Only social scientists locked in an ivory tower
<BR>
seventy-eight light years away from the cognitive scientists and
<BR>
neuroscientists still think that it's a big pattern-catcher.  The
<BR>
existence of instincts far more complex than big-antler-recognition is a
<BR>
demonstrated fact.
<BR>
<P>If &quot;one big pattern catcher&quot; sounds remotely plausible, then you're
<BR>
severely out of date with respect to modern cognitive science and
<BR>
evolutionary psychology.  I would *strongly* recommend that you read the
<BR>
article &quot;The Psychological Foundations of Culture&quot; in the book &quot;The
<BR>
Adapted Mind&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Furthermore - although this statement is my own personal opinion, and
<BR>
not experimentally verified fact - I disagree with your position that
<BR>
useful mutations are less likely to occur within the brain.  The brain
<BR>
is adaptive.  The brain is self-repairing.  The brain is
<BR>
self-programming.  The brain has a logic that proteins, organs, and
<BR>
tissues don't.  I would expect useful mutations to be an order of
<BR>
magnitude more likely within the brain.
