<EM>&gt; I have found in some dictionary and in some e-dictionary those terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *eversion* and *eversive*. I suppose that these terms come from the latin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *ex-vertere*, which has not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same meaning as *sub-vertere* (subversion, subversive).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In Italy we use so much the term eversione and the term rivoluzione
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (revolution).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Revolution is, in principle, or in theory, linked to freedom, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eversione (eversion) is linked to some subtle, hidden oppression, or to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fascism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Eversion is actually merely the democratic process, akin to voting out of office
<BR>
(i.e. turning the inside out) politicians comfortable in their power. Its
<BR>
typical that an area steeped in communist theory would see the democratic
<BR>
process as perpetuating oppression and fascism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the '60s and in the '70s we had both. We had *eversive* bombs and we had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also the revolutionary Red Brigades (still existing). Now we have a sort of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unabomber (we too).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But the very point is: do the extropic themes *appear* (in EU *catholic*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries) linked to freedom? I do not think so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where the Catholic establishment in EU countries, like many other organized
<BR>
religions sees ideas like 'freedom of religion' to mean that they are free to
<BR>
force their religion on others, and any restraint on that freedom must be
<BR>
fascism.
<BR>
<P>Its a twist, much like how people view freedom of expression not to mean &quot;I have
<BR>
a right to my own opinions&quot;, but that  &quot;Everyone has a right to my opinions&quot;.
<BR>
This is the typical busybodiness that causes the encroachment of government
<BR>
power, authoritarianism of any kind that thinks that leaving individuals to
<BR>
their own devices is a violation of nature.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In my modest opinion, (EU) extropians have to do every effort in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; direction.
</EM><BR>
<P>EU countries seem to suffer from a severe case of doublespeak.
