<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interesting ... perhaps we do not want to make certain things
<BR>
known because we can not make them known completely. that is, i want to
<BR>
hide the fact that i did action x because certain people can not fully
<BR>
understand why and under what circumstances i did it; conversely, if all
<BR>
my circumstances and intentions were completely understood, i would lose
<BR>
the motivation to hide anything (presumably, the motivation for hiding
<BR>
being shame, guilt, etc.). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think this may well be the direction in which we are ultimately
<BR>
moving. when we are all powers and become completely rational, perhaps we
<BR>
will also choose to be completely transparent. however, i doubt that our
<BR>
human brains were evolved to handle this kind of transparency. shame,
<BR>
guilt, and indeed deception, are hardwired into the wetware. not only will
<BR>
much energy be expanded to get society to the point of transparency, but
<BR>
much energy will also be required to maintain transparency once we reach
<BR>
it -- it is an uphill battle all the way, an unstable point in the phase
<BR>
space of possible strategies. ultimately, transparency may cost more than
<BR>
it can repay us, at least until we can change ourselves.
