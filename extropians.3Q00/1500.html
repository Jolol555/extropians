&lt;&lt;Loads of interesting stuff, but I had to snip it:(&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've heard such accusations, coming from the British press, or from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;British writers in the American press. I'm not surprised. I'm sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cornwallis reported that his men acted honorably, just as our own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generals claimed the same for our men in Vietnam. I'm sure its rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;embarassing for British people to see the misdeeds of their forebears
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;writ large on the big screen. Denial does wonders to sooth the nerves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It's important to understand that this happens very often when movies are
<BR>
released about what the British call &quot;controversial&quot; topics.  &quot;Braveheart&quot;
<BR>
springs to mind, but esp. for &quot;Michael Collins&quot; and &quot;In the name of the
<BR>
Father&quot;.  When such films show outrages committed by British forces or
<BR>
whatever, the usual cry of &quot;inaccuracies&quot; goes up, along with
<BR>
&quot;oversimplificaton&quot; etc...  By their nature, the British (and the British
<BR>
press in particular) don't like their past misdeeds shown back to them.
<BR>
&quot;Keeping up appearances&quot; is very important to them.
<BR>
<P>Look at N.Ireland.  If it were another country with such civil strife where
<BR>
the Govt. was ineffective, they'd send in a UN peacekeeping force.  But
<BR>
they couldn't be seen have lost control, even though they never really had
<BR>
it.  Unionism was running the show.
<BR>
<P>The next film I want to see is MI2, after that I'm easy.
<BR>
<P>Regards,
<BR>
