<P><EM>&gt; Uh, Spudboy - I'm *not* a Jew.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me throw in my two cents here, I am glad for you that you no longer have 
<BR>
to live a lie. That must have been hellish. My parents are atheist (dad) and 
<BR>
agnostic (mom). In other words, not religious at all. My name, Nadia, comes 
<BR>
from a marvelous Russian intellectual woman - russian jew -  who was a self 
<BR>
proclaimed Jewish Atheist.  So I have always thought it natural to be both! 
<BR>
<P>As a matter of fact.. now that I think of it: Most of my friends who are 
<BR>
Jewish are not at all religious, and most flat out call themselves atheist, 
<BR>
and very 'out of the closet&quot; about it. When they say they are Jewish they 
<BR>
mean the ethnicity, not the spiritual practice.
<BR>
Like being African American or Native American. Is this a strange phenomenon?
<BR>
<P>Separating oneself from the past, but not closing the door on it...
<BR>
As opposed to my non-religious friends who are from Christian families, who 
<BR>
seem more superstitiously &quot;respectful&quot; of everyone's' spiritual beliefs and 
<BR>
find it somewhat distasteful and suspicious when I say I don't believe in God 
<BR>
and outright offensive when I use the term Atheist.. &amp; seem to believe that 
<BR>
one shouldn't speak of such things. 
<BR>
<P>Personally, I'm in favor of letting go of things that shackle you, whatever 
<BR>
they are.
