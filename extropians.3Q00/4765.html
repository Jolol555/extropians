<P>Some argue that Nietzsche was afflicted with a syphilitic infection
<BR>
(this was the original diagnosis of the doctors in Basel and Jena)
<BR>
contracted either while he was a student or while he was serving as a
<BR>
hospital attendant during the Franco-Prussian War; some claim that
<BR>
Nietzsche's use of chloral hydrate, a drug which he had been using as
<BR>
a sedative, deteriorated his already-weakened nervous system; some
<BR>
speculate that Nietzsche's collapse was due to a brain disease he
<BR>
inherited from his father; some maintain that a mental illness
<BR>
gradually drove him insane. The exact cause of Nietzsche's
<BR>
incapacitation still remains unclear. That Nietzsche had an
<BR>
extraordinarily sensitive nervous constitution and took an assortment
<BR>
of medications is well-documented as a more general fact.
