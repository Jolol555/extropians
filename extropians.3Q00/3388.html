<EM>&gt; &gt; Now, any excess heat a planet radiates above that which it receives from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the sun is obviously a result of it turning its angular velocity to heat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; through vulcanism in Venus's case (it doesn't have much angular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; velocity, having a retrograde day of some 240 earth days) and through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; convection in the case of Neptune. Unless you think there are Helium3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people living on Neptune fusing hydrogen for energy...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, the latent heat of planet formation seems to still be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the driver for most of the gas giants (esp. Jupiter).  The insulating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; layer accumulates relatively fast and the gradual gravitational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contraction produces heat that only slowly escapes.  There is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also a fair amount of radioactive material gradually decaying.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is my understanding.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't think the equations of state are well enough understood
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to predict how much heat should be produced by these effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the rates at which they should escape through the overlying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; material.  For example, we can barely make solid-metallic hydrogen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and can't yet measure such properties as electrical or heat conductivity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively).  I think the jury is still out on whether Mars does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or does not have a liquid core.  And Mars is relatively easy compared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the gas giants.
</EM><BR>
<P>True.  I think given the low magnetic activity though, we can guess which
<BR>
verdict the jury is going to pick.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But, I would agree the EvMick's quote of Venus radiating 40x its solar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; input is higher than anything I've ever seen.  Its albedo is very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high, reflecting away much of its incoming light.  The high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is required to create the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very high surface temperatures.  Unless someone is running a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large number of nuclear reactors on the surface, the 40x figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is dubious.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt the figure too, though the surface rock is almost at a liquid state.
<BR>
In fact, some believe that Venus goes through a cycle of complete meltdowns
<BR>
where the crust and mantle are mixed.  The cycle length is estimated to be
<BR>
about half a billion years based on the lack of surface features that seem
<BR>
older than that.
<BR>
<P>So, perhaps heath from Venus' innards makes it out much more quickly than
<BR>
Earth's.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
