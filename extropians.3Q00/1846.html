<P>
The basic hypothesis of a post-Copernican cosmological theory is that all
<BR>
the points of the universe have to be essentially equivalent. This
<BR>
hypothesis is required in order to avoid any privileged observer.
<BR>
<P>This assumption has been implemented by Einstein in the s.c. *cosmological
<BR>
principle*: all the positions in the universe have to be essentially
<BR>
equivalent, so that the universe is (at least mathematically) *homogeneous*.
<BR>
This situation implies the condition of some (spherical) symmetry about
<BR>
every point, so that the universe is (at least locally) *isotropic*.
<BR>
<P>But an *hidden* assumption seems to be in the formulation of the
<BR>
cosmological principle. In fact, the condition that all the points are
<BR>
(statistically) equivalent (with respect to their environment) corresponds
<BR>
to the property of a local *isotropy*. And it is generally accepted that the
<BR>
universe can not be *isotropic* about every point without being also
<BR>
*homogeneous*. 
<BR>
<P>But local *isotropy* does not necessarily implies *homogeneity*. In fact a
<BR>
topological theorem states that homogeneity requires (at least local)
<BR>
isotropy together with the assumption of the *analyticity*.  Analyticity was
<BR>
an usual assumption in any physical problem: before the *fractal* geometry!
<BR>
<P>Actually a *fractal* structure has some local isotropy but has not
<BR>
homogeneity. In simple terms one observes the same mix (structures and
<BR>
vacua) in different directions (statistical isotropy). This means that a
<BR>
*fractal* structure satisfies the cosmological principle! In the sense that
<BR>
all the points are essentially equivalent (no center, no special points).
<BR>
But this does *not* imply that these points are distributed uniformly!
<BR>
<P>Now astronomy showed some intrinsically *irregular* structures for which the
<BR>
analyticity assumption might be reconsidered and fractal properties might be
<BR>
investigated.
<BR>
<P>The space distribution of galaxies and clusters, the cosmic microwave
<BR>
background radiation, the linearity of the redshift-distance relation
<BR>
(Hubble law), the abundance of (light) elements in the universe: each of
<BR>
these four points provides independent experimental facts. The objective of
<BR>
a cosmological theory of the universe (fractal or not) should be to provide
<BR>
a coherent explanation of all these facts together. An important point in
<BR>
the theoretical investigation concerns the distribution of the gravitational
<BR>
force inside structures which could be irregular or fractal.
<BR>
<P>But the recent statistical analysis of the experimental data already shows
<BR>
also that *the distribution of galaxies is fractal* up to the deepest
<BR>
observed scales. In the near future one could describe structures in which
<BR>
intrinsic *self-similar* irregularities develop at *all* scales and
<BR>
fluctuations cannot be described in terms of *analytical* functions. The
<BR>
theoretical methods to describe this situation could not be based on
<BR>
ordinary differential equations because *self-similarity* implies
<BR>
singularities and the absence of analyticity.
