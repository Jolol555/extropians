----- Original Message -----
<BR>
From: &lt;<A HREF="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20IP%20was:%20My%20Extropian%20Manifesto...&In-Reply-To=&lt;04e301c00595$eef56720$b6677318@crdva1.bc.wave.home.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>With regular property you can hope to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; put a guard on what you own, but with IP, you want to both distribute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it and control it.  This requires that you have some kind of &quot;guard&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that can go along with each copy.  It's tough to do when IP is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information and so easily copied.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that there are challenges to be faced.  I also agree that the costs
<BR>
of controlling the information are very relevant.  This is the sort of
<BR>
discussion I think people should be having-- cost vs. benefit, i.e.:
<BR>
arguments from desirability.  My complaint was against the argument from
<BR>
impossibility, i.e.: it doesn't even matter if we want to, 'cause we can't.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; So the reality is that IP is different from other forms of property.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you rule out discussions of this difference in terms of looking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at desirability, you overlook much of the big picture.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I would argue that desirability IS the big picture and includes
<BR>
weighing these factors.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; control IP, but only at the cost of, for example, disallowing encryption.
</EM><BR>
<P>DISallowing encryption?  On the contrary, encryption is a very good thing
<BR>
for IP.  I'm in favor of all sorts of meta-information that add rules and
<BR>
intelligence to our data.
<BR>
<P>Or you need to make it illegal to reverse
<BR>
<EM>&gt; engineer copyright protection systems, like the controversial DMCA law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is being used to shut down the Linux DVD players.  Such proposals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have significant costs.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly.  Again, this is an argument regarding desirability.  How much money
<BR>
are we willing to spend to protect an industry? (And can't we find ways for
<BR>
that industry to pay for it's own protection?  Can we ensure that the
<BR>
industry as a whole is exothermic?)  How much freedom are we willing to
<BR>
relinquish to preserve security?  IMO the best path invariably lies
<BR>
somewhere in the gray area between the two extremes.  It appears to me that
<BR>
some people have problems with this-- thus the prevalence of the slippery
<BR>
slope argument: &quot;Oh, first you want to be able to own your own book, next, I
<BR>
won't be able to look at you without paying you.&quot;  Our ability to proceed in
<BR>
the face of apparent ambiguity speaks to a flexible intellect comfortable in
<BR>
navigating the increasing intricacies of our reality.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In my view, you can't ignore the reality of the difficulties of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controlling IP and just focus on how desirable it would be if you could.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If IP were just like regular property, probably everyone would agree that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it should be controlled in the same way.  Most people here are fervent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advocates of property rights.  It is only because it is different that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some are calling for different treatment.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  But 'different' treatment is not 'no' treatment.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; No doubt a sufficiently Draconian, invasive and universal political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system would allow for control of IP.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  We probably can't expect to have absolute control over it-- much like
<BR>
we don't have absolute control over a human's ability to kill another.
<BR>
Instead, we find a way to operate within acceptable parameters.  Let me
<BR>
change a single word in your above sentence:  &quot;No doubt a sufficiently
<BR>
Draconian, invasive and universal political system would allow for control
<BR>
of murder.&quot;  I think you'll agree that this sentence is not a good argument
<BR>
against attempting to legislate against murders at -all.-
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;But in terms of our understanding
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of the technical issues, it appears that controlling many forms of IP
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be difficult and costly to achieve.  Ultimately it is these costs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which are driving the proposals for rethinking how we manage IP.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good.  Actually, this is precisely why I am quite optimistic about how
<BR>
things turn out.  Rules on the sharing and distribution of property create
<BR>
markets, and market pressures are &quot;a good thing&quot; and a sensitivity to costs
<BR>
tends to lead to increasing fitness.  The selection pressure in this
<BR>
environment is towards nimble, smart, economical protection of data.  This
<BR>
has so many other spin-off benefits that it makes me tingle just to say the
<BR>
phrase &quot;nimble, smart, economical protection of data.&quot;  :)
