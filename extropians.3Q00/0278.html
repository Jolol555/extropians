<P><EM>    &gt; And your NMD has done its job by making the bad guys use a much
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;inferior  method of delivery.  It is easier to detect,
</EM><BR>
<P>Not quite, it's astronomically harder to detect a suitcase nuke than a warhead
<BR>
screaming through the atmosphere, and even more important, it's virtually
<BR>
impossible to trace.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;and if detonated does much *less* damage than a missile that can detonate
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;at an optimal position
</EM><BR>
<P>You could position your bomb with an error of only a few feet thanks to good old UPS.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;and altitude.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll grant that you might not be at the perfect altitude, but there are elevators, and with
<BR>
such powerful bombs you don't need perfection.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;And it *cannot* be used as a credible long term  *threat*...
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not? Once  a city, any city, blows up for unknown reasons no country would need
<BR>
to overtly threaten  the USA about hidden bombs in its cities because the implied threat
<BR>
would always be there.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;It is only a weapon of terror, not an unspoken adjunct to diplomacy.
</EM><BR>
<P>The distinction eludes me.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;How much differently would we have treated the Soviet Union
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;during the cold war if we did not fear their nuclear missiles?
</EM><BR>
<P>A nuclear missile will always be fearful have a political punch unless the population of
<BR>
the target country is 100% certain it can shoot it down, 99% is not nearly good enough.
<BR>
It's not going to happen.
