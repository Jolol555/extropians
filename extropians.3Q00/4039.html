<BR>
<EM>&gt; It's not valid if &quot;unreal&quot; is a null set.  It holds no meaning.
</EM><BR>
<P>But it's not a null set. Unreal means that which is false, untrue, fictional,
<BR>
having no reality, actual existence, or substance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do you believe that there are unreal things?
</EM><BR>
<P>Belief has nothing to do with it. I accept that there are bogus inventions of
<BR>
philosophers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ah... I see the nature of our disagreement.  You believe that you are able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to perceive reality directly?
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone can perceive reality directly. Just stop thinking about it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So, when you look at a pen, you believe that you are directly seeing the pen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as opposed to photons that have been reflected from its surface?
</EM><BR>
<P>No, when I look at a pen I don't &quot;believe&quot; anything. I simply look at the pen.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I do not place absolute belief in my senses.  I am aware of the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they represent information regarding properties of the object and not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object itself.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hopefully you don't do that while driving. You'd be a menace on the highway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let us suppose that I have a bunch of multi-colored tennis balls, that I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bouncing up against some object.  And let us further suppose that due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature of this object, only the orange balls are 'springy' enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ricochet over a wall and land in your lap.  Do you think that only receiving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orange balls from the object is an indication that the object itself is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orange?  Or instead an indication of a particular property of the object?
</EM><BR>
<P>This reminds me of the story called &quot;The Goose Is Out.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I zenji asked his students to imagine a milk bottle with a goose in it.
<BR>
Then he asked them how to get the goose out of the bottle without breaking the
<BR>
bottle or killing the goose.
<BR>
I bright student answered (correctly), &quot;The goose is out!&quot;
<BR>
<P>You see, if it's an imaginary bottle and an imaginary goose, than it's easy to
<BR>
simply imagine that the goose is out.
<BR>
<P>When you stop imagining things and simply see things as they are, then you have
<BR>
awakened from your reverie of suppositions and conjecture.
<BR>
People can conjure all sorts of philosophic nonsense to entertain themselves.
<BR>
I don't consider it extropic at all to waste time with such silliness.
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Something beckons within the reach of each of us
<BR>
to save heroic genius. Find it, and do it.
<BR>
For as goes heroic genius, so goes humankind.&quot;
