<EM>&gt; There is a demand for housing, and there are people with some money who want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; housing. That would certainly be to their benefit to buy real estaet, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when they win, others lose. Who? Those who already are house owners would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lose. Now their commodity is less valuable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Wealth is relative, in many ways.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 60% of American householders own their own homes. A significant % of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Americans (20%? 30%?) would like to own a home but may not be able to afford
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what they want under *current*market*conditions*.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 60% &gt; 30%! Game over man, game over.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are, of course, other factors, but I see this as the main dynamic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Artifically induced market conditions, you ought to say, since at least 1/3 of
<BR>
the US is under the ownership of the federal and state governments, where no
<BR>
development is allowed. Since the Constitution forbids federal ownership outside
<BR>
of DC, its all 'held in trust' for the people, but when the people try to claim
<BR>
their property, they are faced with guns and stormtroopers...
