<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;clear, well-written tutorial on genetic technology that leads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a quick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;overview of the basics, through a description of the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;art
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and frontiers of research and development through a near- to mid- to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;far-term
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;projection of the benefits to be gained from these efforts.  This kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;thing needs to be punchy and easy to read, ideally organized in short,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;easily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;digested &quot;bullet points.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><P>There are 2 ways this sort of thing could be done--at the corporate level,
<BR>
which might involve TV ads and full-color brochures; or at the individual
<BR>
level.
<BR>
<P>The internet offers an unprecedented opportunity for communication at the
<BR>
individual level, which is mainly limited by the volume of information
<BR>
received by each individual and the need to filter out most of what's
<BR>
received.  Even considering this limitation, given the number of people on
<BR>
this list, we could reach a huge number of people.  Remember the Kevin Bacon
<BR>
game and the &quot;Six Degrees of Separation.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I'm on several gardening and homesteading lists, whose members tend to be
<BR>
anti-GM, and I've made it a point to mention on those lists some of the good
<BR>
GM things that are being done.  I haven't been flamed outta town, so
<BR>
apparently it's possible to communicate.  IMO one of the most important
<BR>
things to remember is that there ARE at least 2 sides to the issue, and that
<BR>
in some instances the anti-GM people are probably right.
<BR>
<P>When dealing non-coercively with people whose viewpoints are very different
<BR>
from one's own, a necessary first step is to find a place of common thought.
<BR>
Pay attention to the anti-GM people.  Many of them are just copying what
<BR>
they've heard someone else say, but some of them have thought things through
<BR>
and come to their own conclusions.  Ask them what their concerns are. And so
<BR>
forth.
