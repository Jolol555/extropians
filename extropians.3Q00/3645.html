<EM>&gt; Thus, a philosophically naive person, thru his or her willingness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such nonsense as part of the &quot;training,&quot; could easilly lose all grip on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality as we know it, at least on a cognitive level.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know much about Scientology other than what I've seen on the
<BR>
internet. but I've known a person who practiced it and lived for a while in
<BR>
their Florida community.  This person was one of the most disturbing
<BR>
individuals I've ever talked to.  Whenever he spoke of a topic related to
<BR>
Scientology (and as their training is broad, many things in daily life seem
<BR>
to be related to Scientology) he would begin to speak in a monotone, as
<BR>
though he were reciting words that had been fed into his mind under
<BR>
hypnosis.  Some of the stuff they believe would ordinarily be pretty funny,
<BR>
but it was a bit frightening to see someone taking it so seriously. If I
<BR>
tried to reason with this person, for example by pointing out internal
<BR>
inconsistencies in his bullshit, he would change the subject and refuse to
<BR>
even consider the idea the Ron Hubbard might have been wrong, even about the
<BR>
smallest item. The CoS had even taken a huge sum of money from this person
<BR>
through fraud, and he himself said that he'd been defrauded. I think they
<BR>
even kicked him out of the church when he asked for his money back, and even
<BR>
though he'd been so shabbily treated, his greatest desire seemed to be to
<BR>
get back into the Church.  It was quite pathetic.
<BR>
<P>I don't think the CoS is any worse than other religions, but all religions
<BR>
have the potential of being deadly, and this one seems more dangerous than
<BR>
many others because it's on the rise, in its fanatic stage rather than being
<BR>
a mature religion.
