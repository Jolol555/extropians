<P><EM>&gt; What is this SysOp nonsense all over again? Why is the robot yours,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you are not your robot's? And how did that robot came into being?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And what keeps that robot friendly, or even alive, so that he can keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you alive?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, excuuuuuse me. I guess I missed the &quot;SysOp&quot; lecture. I must have been in
<BR>
South Dakota that day. So how does that relate to AI friendliness? The robot is
<BR>
mine because I bought it. Robots are robots because they behave robotically. So
<BR>
they can't own humans. That robot came into being any way it could. It's a given
<BR>
for the purpose of discussing why AI would want to be friendly. The question
<BR>
isn't how AI comes into being; it's why it would want to be friendly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm beginning to think that you're rather good at trolling. No one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can't be that dense nondeliberately.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sad to learn you think that way. But I don't recall you proposing any
<BR>
constructive ideas about making AI friendly. So, to demonstrate that *you* are
<BR>
not trolling, please let us in on your formula for insuring that AI would want
<BR>
to be friendly. If you don't think that AI would want to be friendly, that
<BR>
suggests that you believe AI should not be attempted at all. In that case, how
<BR>
do you propose to keep AI from emerging?
<BR>

<BR>
<P>PS: &quot;no one can't be that dense&quot; is a double negative.
