</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno if it always will be, but a truly horrid example of inane and maybe
<BR>
insane cargo-cultism was French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's attempted use
<BR>
of topology and set theory in understanding the mind, likewise Michel
<BR>
Foucault's. This stuff still gets trotted out in a usually successful
<BR>
attempt to dazzle ignorant arts students (and profs). Here's some examples
<BR>
(from my book THE ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL):
<BR>
<P>===============
<BR>
<P>At the same time, there seems now to be a tendency in the non-scientific
<BR>
disciplines to embrace an obverse of the cautious post-Gödelian
<BR>
mathematical programme: to write and publish as if undecidables were
<BR>
everywhere, sanctioned by the formalisms of metamathematics, topology or
<BR>
group theory (usually, it seems, barely understood).
<BR>
<P>Carnival!  Lévi-Strauss, doyen of structuralism, reportedly swore by this
<BR>
mantra:  `Fx(a) : Fy(b) = Fx(b) : Fa--1(y)'.  His commentator Gardner
<BR>
(1974:269), regrettably, has been `unable to make sense of this formula'. 
<BR>
<P>Loose borrowings from the precise language of mathematics are perhaps more
<BR>
prevalent in francophone discourses, though they increasingly infect
<BR>
anglophone post-structuralism.  It is hard to resist using the term
<BR>
`trajectory' as a metaphor for a notional curve marked out by the
<BR>
sequential intellectual `positions' taken or `constructed' by individuals
<BR>
or groups.  The ballistic graph it embodies is, once noticed, strikingly
<BR>
overdetermining, as if a scholar's destination and path is set, apart from
<BR>
the odd buffet, at the moment of `launch'.  
<BR>
<P>Foucault, whose own discourse inveighs against the easy acceptance of
<BR>
received ways of description and analysis, litters his expositions with
<BR>
fragments of seemingly ill-digested scientific jargon, which all too often
<BR>
suffer a weight of explanatory value they cannot bear.  One wonders how
<BR>
many non-scientist readers of the following meditation on power, knowledge
<BR>
and sexuality recognise the undefined and therefore finally unintelligible
<BR>
mathematical armature on which they are mounted:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `distributions of power' and the `appropriations of knowledge' never
<BR>
represent only instantaneous slices taken from processes involving, for
<BR>
example, a cumulative reinforcement of the strongest factor, or a reversal
<BR>
of relationship, or again, a simultaneous increase in two terms.  Relations
<BR>
of power-knowledge are not static forms of distribution, they are `matrices
<BR>
of transformation'. (Foucault, 1984:99)
<BR>
<P>This mimicking of the calculi of physics passes within a page to a
<BR>
straight-faced parody of topology, possibly borrowed from René Thom's then
<BR>
fashionable schemata of elementary catastrophe surfaces (Zeeman,
<BR>
1976:65---83):
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is said about sex must not be analyzed simply as the surface of
<BR>
projection of these power mechanisms.  Indeed, it is in discourse that
<BR>
power and knowledge are joined together.  And for this very reason, we must
<BR>
conceive discourse as a series of discontinuous segments whose tactical
<BR>
function is neither uniform nor stable. (Foucault, 1984:100)
<BR>
<P>Jacques Lacan clowned at the carnival with more than one choice item of
<BR>
dubious algebraisation.  In his perhaps most-often quoted essay `The
<BR>
insistence of the Letter in the Unconscious' (Lacan, 1970) he presents, in
<BR>
what passes for precise formal notation, the process through which the
<BR>
elements of a signifying chain manifest themselves as metonymy:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;`f(S . . . S1) S = S (-) s'.  
<BR>
<P>According to the key, (-) represents the barrier between signifier and
<BR>
signified, but this hardly makes the pseudo-formula any more scientific.
<BR>
The matter becomes more distressing when he presents his formula for metaphor:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;`f(S1/S) S--S ( + ) s'.  
<BR>
<P>Now we learn that the plus-sign ( + ) `represents here the leap over the
<BR>
line--and the constitutive value of the leap for the emergence of meaning.
<BR>
<P>`This leap is an expression of the condition of passage of the signifier
<BR>
into the signified . . . although provisionally confusing it with the place
<BR>
of the subject' (ibid.:123---4)
<BR>
<P>Sadly, this `mathematisation' of Lacan's, whereby he purports to introduce
<BR>
the `function of the subject' lacks a basis in any established or defined
<BR>
mathematical formalism.  Opinion is divided about how literally we are
<BR>
meant to take such Lacanian essays into algebra and topology.  Sherry
<BR>
Turkle (1992:227---40) offers little more than a series of metaphysical
<BR>
flurries: `There are several ways in which mathematicians might enter a
<BR>
theoretical discourse about the nature of [human beings].  Mathematics can
<BR>
be used metaphorically; or it can be used very literally in the
<BR>
construction of precise and delimited mathematical models.  Lacan's use of
<BR>
topology fits neither of these categories' (ibid.:229).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This seems to me intellectually careless.  Perhaps of no other field of
<BR>
discourse than formal mathematics can it be asserted so categorically that
<BR>
there is only one valid way to construe its signifying principles, namely,
<BR>
via the path from arbitrary axioms and transformation rules to provable
<BR>
theorems, always allowing for Gödelian and computational undecidables.  
<BR>
<P>Of course I am not attempting to rule out of court meta-mathematical
<BR>
discussion, let alone investigations by sociologists of knowledge into the
<BR>
sources and uses of mathematical models and procedures.  I am insisting,
<BR>
however, that having once decided on the formalism 1 + 1 = 2, we cannot
<BR>
(for the sport or mystery of it) decide within the same universe of
<BR>
discourse to dispute the equality so established.  Hence, when Turkle adds
<BR>
that `Lacan . . . asserted the need for equational science among those who
<BR>
he feels use poetic justification to avoid the hard and rigorous work ahead
<BR>
and asserted the need for poetry among those who may be allowing scientific
<BR>
rigor to narrow their field of vision' (ibid.:238), this seems to me
<BR>
finally nothing better than self-deception on both his part and hers.
<BR>
Similar fanciful `borrowing' from mathematics is offered in Stuart
<BR>
Schneiderman's Jacques Lacan: The Death of an Intellectual Hero (1983),
<BR>
where, in the spirit of Lacan, we are told that in the notation of set
<BR>
theory the sound of one hand clapping is the empty set.  Schneiderman's
<BR>
book is also remarkable for its reification of Death and Desire (a category
<BR>
error not uncharacteristic of psychoanalysis) and its sense of Freud as
<BR>
divine oracle (ibid.:145, 77---8).
<BR>
<P>Further evidence for this stern verdict is seen in Martin Thom's paper `The
<BR>
Unconscious Structured as a Language' (in MacCabe, 1981).  The first part
<BR>
is an edited version of Thom's 1975 account of Lacan, drawing heavily on
<BR>
Jean Laplanche and Serge Leclaire's `L'Inconsciente: une étude
<BR>
psychanalytique'.  The 1979 revision attempts to correct misreadings of
<BR>
Lacan now discerned in that paper, especially Laplanche's contribution
<BR>
(which had been repudiated by Lacan himself).  Thom's finger-wagging
<BR>
discussion of the ills attendant upon treating Lacan's pseudo-algebraisms
<BR>
literally rather than as graphically heuristic metaphors is unintentionally
<BR>
amusing, since he (along with many others) was originally enthralled
<BR>
precisely by what is now seen as a major misinterpretation.  It's as if an
<BR>
early relativity theorist had blindly lauded the formula E=mc^3, retracting
<BR>
it only after a curt note from Einstein mentioning that what he'd actually
<BR>
said was E=mc^2. In view of Lacan's clarification, Thom corrects the
<BR>
formula-- relating such arcana as Name of the Father, Desire of the Mother,
<BR>
Signified to the subject, and the Phallus--(MacCabe, 1981:41), adding: `As
<BR>
I understand this formulation, the child's capture in the imaginary order,
<BR>
as one who has a specular ego, is inseparable from the action of a primal
<BR>
repression that places him or her within a Symbolic order' (ibid.:42).
<BR>
What is remarkable is that Thom remains none too confident that he
<BR>
`understands the formulation' even as he continues to expound it.  For such
<BR>
intellectual obeisance to be justifiable, Lacan would need to be a
<BR>
transcendental oracle, whose gnomic gifts we must struggle helplessly to
<BR>
unlock.  And that indeed is how he presented himself in his seminars.
<BR>
<P>Carnival indeed!  In 1766 the religious mathematician Leonhard Euler
<BR>
similarly put the innumerate atheist Diderot to ignominious flight with a
<BR>
phoney piece of `mathematical logic' (which actually proves nothing):
<BR>
`Monsieur, (a + bn)/n = X, therefore God exists; respond!' (Hogben, 1967:9). 
<BR>
<P>In the absence of absolute certainty--of `decidability'--must the critic,
<BR>
too, fall into such blatant (if unintentionally comic) bad faith?  Of
<BR>
course, it is not only literary critics who misplace Ockham's razor on
<BR>
occasion.  Discourse within the sciences, especially those which abut
<BR>
ideological interests and prejudices most directly, requires the same
<BR>
vigilance.
