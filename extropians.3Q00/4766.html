<EM>&gt; &gt; The reason to label anything is to differentiate it from other things so
</EM><BR>
as
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to have an easier time understanding it and communicating about it.
</EM><BR>
(The
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; former is more important than the latter.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i have to agree. after all, i've participated in discussing many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;idle&quot; concepts myself; like esoteric mathematics, i always felt finer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinctions will turn out to be useful in some unforseen way.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think art or mathematical concepts are idle.  I do think that almost
<BR>
all theoretical knowledge has an eventual application somewhere.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; however, the question involved here -- distinguishing art from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non-art -- is hellishly complex. do we define art based on whatever most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people call art, or discover it through studying a finite number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;established&quot; art works? perhaps we may design a definition for art to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reap the most benefit -- but in what spheres of influence?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think one can start by trying to look at what is called art and try to see
<BR>
what art objects have in common.  Defining something need not be easy, but
<BR>
it can be done.  I think after some examination, we might come to agree some
<BR>
works originally thought to be art are not art.  This is no different than
<BR>
someone mistakenly including whales in the category of fish by defining fish
<BR>
as &quot;swimming animals&quot; and later coming to see this definition is overbroad.
<BR>
(This simplistic definition of fish would mean also that humans and birds
<BR>
are also part time fish!  Not a useful definition, though a good starting
<BR>
point as any.:)
<BR>
<P>In this way, one would, to borrow from Dewey, &quot;rationally reconstruct&quot; the
<BR>
idea of art.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; old theories of tolstoy and santayana come to mind ... but it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems new trends are always dead-set to shatter whatever commonality we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have perceived so far. ultimately, perhaps art is a just a tautology --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever we deem art ends up becoming art.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  If art is just a labeling game, then it does not explain why
<BR>
for ages most people believed certain things to be art and why those things
<BR>
had certain traits different from all other things.  For instance,
<BR>
paintings, in general portray objects on two dimensional surfaces.  (Only
<BR>
abstract painting does not to this, but this type of &quot;painting&quot; only came
<BR>
about recently and remains hotly contested as being painting at all.)
<BR>
Renaissance painters did not say, &quot;Hey, I deem this a painting, ergo, it is
<BR>
a painting!&quot;  Surely, they lacked a rigorous defintion of painting, but they
<BR>
certainly did not have this authoritarian view in mind.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; i don't pretend to be objective; explicitly or implicitly, i too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operate under some set of criteria, distinguishing art from other
</EM><BR>
phenomena.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; yet, it often seems that my tastes tend to run counter to the mainstream.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extrapolating a few generations into the future (ignoring the obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inconveniences of the singularity), i can picture a time when &quot;consensus&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works of art would seem decidedly un-artly to me. what recourse would i
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have then? like the lone sane man on a mad planet, would i declare that i
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alone knew what art is?
</EM><BR>
<P>The test would be finding out what these postulated future works have in
<BR>
common and seeing if they fit into the concept of art.  A good definition of
<BR>
art would be able to handle such works, but that does not mean it would
<BR>
allow an anything goes attitude.  An easy example of this would be to look
<BR>
at the sonnet in English.  The sonnet is a poetic form.  (Since poetry is a
<BR>
form of art, the sonnet is a form of art.:)  There was a time when there
<BR>
were no English sonnet.  The form, in fact, originated in Italy -- if my
<BR>
memory's correct.  English poets then adapted it to their language.  Was
<BR>
this a crisis in distinguishing poetry from non-poetry?  Hardly!  I think
<BR>
the same sort of thing will apply to future art and future non-art.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I would not confuse art with design.  The shirt I'm wearing now -- a
</EM><BR>
Perry
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ellis short sleeve -- has a design I like on it.  In fact, it's one of
</EM><BR>
my
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; favorite shirts.  Yet I would not label it a work of art.  It is
</EM><BR>
pleasing to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; my eyes and comfortable to wear, but it is not art.  I value it, yet I
</EM><BR>
do
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not call it or classify it as art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; By the same token, there are things or works which I do classify as art,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which I do not value or like.  Some of these art works I'm even repulsed
</EM><BR>
by.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yet I still believe them to be art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You see, something can be art without being valued by someone.  Someone
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; even agree something is art, yet not like it and not want to experience
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ever again.  Someone can love something, yet know it is not art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps i implicitly (and subconsciously) operated under the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; association of art with intellectual status. nonetheless, if only for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practical reasons, perhaps we'd do better to abandon the concept of &quot;art&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as we know it and just stick with personal taste. i know it may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intellectually lazy, but it's not obvious to me what we would lose by such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a move.
</EM><BR>
<P>If art serves a deeper need than just sensual pleasure, then we might lose a
<BR>
lot.  In terms of serving this need, we might randomly grope for good art,
<BR>
yet only get non-art or bad art.  (Non-art is not identical with bad art.)
<BR>
It might be akin to eating junk food and wondering why one is experiencing
<BR>
all sorts of health problems.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
