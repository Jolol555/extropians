<EM>&gt;&gt;Subject: Raising children, spouses, and friends
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Starting off three separate, related threads.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;I've noticed that *very* few of us have publicly mentioned having children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(Me, Barbara, Keith Henson, Sasha, Minsky, uh...)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Many are relatively young, and single.  But many are not.  Have you 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;consciously chosen not to have kids?  If so, why?  Do you have kids, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;have chosen not to mention it?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>My wife and I have pretty much chosen not to have kids.  While I like kids,
<BR>
I'm not really all that pushed to commit the kind of time and resources
<BR>
needed to do it properly.  I did quite a bit of looking after my younger
<BR>
brother (11 years diff.) back in the '80s, so I feel I've done my time:)
<BR>
<P>My wife's not into kids really, plus she's not too gone on the whole
<BR>
pregnancy/childbirth thingy.  Can't say I'd blame her!  Would NOT be me if
<BR>
the roles were reversed.  She is impressed by the artificial womb idea....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Of those who admit to having meat-spawn, how have you raised your kids?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;How do you deal with biases of the school system?  Are they given any sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of religious upbringing?  Do your kids know about libertarianism, cryonics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;nano-technology, space colonization, SETI, the Singularity, etc.?  Do they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;share your interests?  Have you taken any particular steps to inculcate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;rationality in them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Meat-Spawn&quot; - Gotta love it!  Must remember that one, my sister will
<BR>
appreciate that.  She has two &quot;Darlings&quot;:-&gt;  Not having kids just leaves me
<BR>
with my hapless family and co-workers to brainwash.  Seriously though, I
<BR>
tend not to discuss it with most people, unless innocently interjecting
<BR>
some &gt;Human idea into the conversation.  I did kinda surprise my boss' boss
<BR>
when I explained some of the work being done in nuclear fusion (not that I
<BR>
know a whole lot).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Those of you with life-mates:  how do they feel about your extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;interests?  Do they share them?  Tolerate them?  Did they share any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;these interests prior to the start of your relationship, or did you convert 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;them?  (Or, did they convert you?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>She met me before I ever knew about any of this stuff, so she's seen me
<BR>
transititon from an NPC (Non Practicing Catholic - It's an Irish thing) to
<BR>
a secular transhumanist.  She's not been completely comfortable with it,
<BR>
but it tends not to cause a problem.  We've not had any major discussions
<BR>
on the deep points of &gt;Humanism.  On one occasion, when the subject of
<BR>
living in a manufactured, non-organic body came up, she stated &quot;I wouldn't
<BR>
want it to be anything man-made&quot;.  I replied &quot;but you already ARE
<BR>
manmade!&quot;.  Made her think, I think.  Was certainly a good conversation
<BR>
stopper:)  She also recently realized, after seeing an elderly lady bent
<BR>
over and using a cane to walk down the street, that the point of radical
<BR>
life extension is to live long AND healthy lives, not just long ones.  She
<BR>
reached this point by herself too, a point I've not seen many people
<BR>
achieve.  She said &quot;I've just had a thought....&quot; and proceeded to state the
<BR>
above in her own words.  I was impressed...
<BR>
<P>I've also got subscriptions to several science magazines, and she'll
<BR>
sometimes curl up in bed with the latest issue of New Scientist while I'm
<BR>
tapping these keys.  She also gets me Science books at our local library.
<BR>
Picks pretty good titles too....
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;And for everyone:  Do you try to pass the memes on to your friends and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;colleagues?  How successful have you been?  Who seems the most/least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;receptive?  What approaches worked?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Being Irish, I tend to use a little humour in the rare event of being able
<BR>
to contribute to discussions with a transhumanist edge.  Then again, if we
<BR>
ever get the ITFA webpage up and going, they may start looking a little
<BR>
strangely at me.....
<BR>
<P>A good series of questions these.  We can all learn something new about
<BR>
each other.
<BR>
<P>Slan,
<BR>
<P><P><P>James...
