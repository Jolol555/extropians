<P><EM>&gt; I am still using my original name. My Dad did very well, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; giving me, a baffling and distinctive person, a baffling and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinctive name.
</EM><BR>
<P>I got the idea to change my name on my 51st birthday several months ago and
<BR>
my daughter Kat and I had been discussing possibilities.  When we first saw
<BR>
your name we both thought it was one of the most beautiful names we'd ever
<BR>
seen or heard.
<BR>
<P>My father picked the name Barbara for me. My grandmother told me the source
<BR>
of my father's pleasure in the name:  During WWII many English children were
<BR>
sent to the USA so they wouldn't be in danger from the bombing.  One of
<BR>
these was a teenaged girl by the name of Barbara who was sent to Austin
<BR>
where my father met her and fell in love.  They were too young to think of
<BR>
marriage, and after the bombings stopped Barbara went home and my father
<BR>
never saw her again.  He still has a photograph of the two of them sitting
<BR>
with their heads close together on my grandfather's boat. So I suppose the
<BR>
personal meaning of my name is &quot;unfulfilled love.&quot; (As life turned out, I
<BR>
grew up and married a British man)
<BR>
<P>Barbara
