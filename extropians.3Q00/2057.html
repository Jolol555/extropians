<EM>&gt;  Entertainers will have to make their money by selling experiences -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  something which can not be copied (yet) and passed around.  Examples are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  live events, interactions with fans, interactive games, etc.

<BR>
The Dead already made that clear, and &quot;experience&quot; can be copied too, and 
<BR>
passed around.  The way they handled it was smart. Keep it in the family so 
<BR>
to speak.
<BR>
<P>It's not about people wanting to keep their music from being passed around. 
<BR>
<P>There seems to be no problem with people passing around free digital formats 
<BR>
of all kinds in private. The legal action only recently arises when other 
<BR>
parties (software companies, servers, or whoever) are making a profit off the 
<BR>
artists without the obligatory residuals: which usually amounts to a teeny 
<BR>
small percentage of sales. Without sales, there is no percentage... but still 
<BR>
someone's cashing in...  even if only to a small profit margin throug 
<BR>
advertising.
<BR>
<P>As much as I love freedom, and agree that pirating is uncontrollable, and we 
<BR>
have to face facts, as an artist, I can see why Napster and any other company 
<BR>
that profits from pirating would rankle. Bootlegs too, as much as we love 
<BR>
them, are unethical. 
<BR>
Yet they will continue to exist, be bought and sold, and people will go to 
<BR>
jail over it.
<BR>
<P>If a fan loves my art, let him copy it off my website, or hell - I'd rather 
<BR>
e-mail it to the person MYSELF for free than have you make a profit off me 
<BR>
and laugh in my face.
<BR>
<P>IMO, This is the unethical act, albeit clever: making money off a product you 
<BR>
don't own  --  not the copying or sharing itself for enjoyment by users.
