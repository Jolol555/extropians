-The US Navy had announced that it had registered two explosions the second much
<BR>
greater than the first. This has now been confirmed by Norwegian Seismologists
<BR>
who say there was one explosion at 0728 and 27 sec registering about 1.5 on the
<BR>
Richter scale. The second at 0730 and 42 sec registering about 3.5 on the
<BR>
Richter scale (equivalent to one to two tons of TNT explosive detonated
<BR>
underwater)
<BR>
-There where 10 senior naval officers on board as observers.
<BR>
-There has been a lot of contact between NATO (and some NATO members
<BR>
independently) and the Russians on this matter. There have even been two visits
<BR>
from Russian representatives at NATO headquarters.
<BR>
- 2/3 of the crew could have been killed by the explosion that sunk the sub
<BR>
according to Jane's.
<BR>
-The K-141 Kursk was one of the Russian subs with the best trained crews, and
<BR>
was soon to be deployed in the Mediterranean as part of a carrier group. This
<BR>
deployment is/was planned as a show of force, to remind the world that Russia is
<BR>
still a world power. The major exercise in which the Kursk was taking part was a
<BR>
prelude to this deployment. Interestingly this task force is to be led by the
<BR>
Aircraft carrier Kuznetsov, which had to be towed back to port a few months ago,
<BR>
while taking part in another such deployment.
<BR>
<P>Why did they wait?
<BR>
-The hatches on the Kursk are compatible with the LR5 rescue submarine sent by
<BR>
the British. And the Russians were very likely to know that from the beginning.
<BR>
- The first estimates had said there should be enough air left until early
<BR>
friday, why take risks? Knowing 48 hr at least were needed if everything went
<BR>
well to get outside help.
<BR>
-Why was the 'foreign' rescue mission not allowed to land and depart from the
<BR>
military base, which was closest but had instead to take a longer route.
<BR>
<P>&lt;specualation&gt;
<BR>
Putin is being heavily criticized at home for his apparent lack of interest in
<BR>
the matter.
<BR>
Russian military Top brass  seem to be resisting foreign 'interference' and even
<BR>
leaking 'rumors' of foreign responsibility in the accident with Defense minister
<BR>
Sergeyev (ex-commander of strategic rocket forces (nuclear forces), and a noted
<BR>
anti western) backing these stories (i.e. US sub 'ramming' the Kursk, reports of
<BR>
another sub resting on the sea floor then secretly limping back to norway
<BR>
etc...). If so, Putin is likely to have at least not resisted the military,
<BR>
because he is a strong supporter of a 'strong' Russia. We may have seen some
<BR>
political infighting, with some supporting foreign help and openness while
<BR>
others, backed by the defense minister  and the military preferring to keep the
<BR>
lid on the accident and avoiding 'outsiders' meddling in their affairs. The
<BR>
decision may have been to try and keep the lid on the whole story (the story was
<BR>
only revealed 2 days later and not by the government or the military), and the
<BR>
military would try it's own rescue.
<BR>
Either they had to concede to a Wednesday deadline (+ 48hrs needed for foreign
<BR>
help to arrive would coincide with the first estimates on amount of air left ,
<BR>
which was early Friday)
<BR>
Or they were forced into accepting foreign assistance because of the public
<BR>
outrage.
<BR>
In any case everyone seems to have lost in this affair, first and foremost the
<BR>
sailors of the Kursk, of course. The military and government leaders (including
<BR>
Putin) have now to endure the public outrage, because they have not done
<BR>
everything that could be done to save the sailors, and on the international
<BR>
front Russia will have lost face and prestige, because of having to rely on its
<BR>
'enemy'  for help. Ironically the image that NATO is still the great enemy that
<BR>
they have themselves in a large part created for their political purposes, will
<BR>
now work against them.
<BR>
I just wonder if (or hope that) the Sailors, if any are still alive, and their
<BR>
families know that even the 'enemy' thinks of them as men, and that our thoughts
<BR>
go with them.
<BR>
