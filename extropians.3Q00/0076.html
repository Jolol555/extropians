</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
<BR>
<EM>&gt; females are more drawn to tall (&quot;dark and handsome&quot; too) males
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to shorter males.  To them it probably just looks better.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I was in the city today and took a look at _The Mating Mind_, which has been
<BR>
a subject of recent discussion on this list.  I didn't like it enough to
<BR>
want to own it, so I just read parts of it while I was in the bookstore.  I
<BR>
think G. Miller would say that women are attracted to tall men because
<BR>
tallness is a sign of fitness.
<BR>
<P>Several days ago someone (was it you, Spike?) said they'd really liked the
<BR>
book and wanted to discuss it.  The reviews that were posted here were
<BR>
very...um, scholarly-like.  You know what I mean?  Is this a man-thing or
<BR>
what?  Miller says that women are more likely to understand the word &quot;azure&quot;
<BR>
but men are more likely to use it, even if they think it means &quot;vermillion.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I found the parts of the book I read quite entertaining.  I laughed and
<BR>
laughed, until I was afraid I was bothering the other people who were
<BR>
sitting around reading. I could see so much of myself and people I know
<BR>
there in those pages! Someone should do a study on how specific personality
<BR>
traits in one sex generally correlate with the characteristics a person
<BR>
finds attractive in the opposite sex.  Maybe it's already been done and it
<BR>
was in a part of the book I didn't read.  Now if I were sitting around with
<BR>
a bunch of other women, we'd have fun talking and laughing about the kind of
<BR>
guys we find attractive (I found G. Miller to be quite attractive, by the
<BR>
way; I never can resist a man who makes me think and laugh at the same
<BR>
time).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;But
<BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionarily speaking a tall man would probably have been a better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; defender of hearth and home than a short guy.
</EM><BR>
<P>Another thing Miller questioned was the assumption that Pleistocene women
<BR>
NEEDED defending by men. More likely they lived together in groups of
<BR>
several women with their kids.  I've gotten in big trouble and been called a
<BR>
man-basher and worse for saying this, but the fact is that while I adore men
<BR>
as friends and lovers, I prefer women as house-mates. For one thing, they
<BR>
don't try to own me. But the owning thing may be cultural rather than
<BR>
hard-wired.
