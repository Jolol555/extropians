I think it will do is give more momentum to the development of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;decentralized information storage and exchange systems, and better metrics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for automating replication, migration, and maintenance of information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;integrity within them.  I am really interested to see what kinds of systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and protocols emerge to support (more universal) 'nomadic data access' and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'task mobility.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Y'all have thoughts on the 'ubiquitous computing environment' paradigm?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is being approached in different ways by different institutions, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was reading DARPA's 'Ubicomp' proposal,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;( <A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations/CBD_00-45.html">http://www.darpa.mil/ito/Solicitations/CBD_00-45.html</A>  )
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(snip)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Ubiquitous Computing Initiative (Ubicomp) will address issues in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;providing a new computing environment in which the users' physical spaces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become embedded with computing functionality, as the present-day computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disappears.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (/snip)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and pondering the potential impacts of its application, in conjunction with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'distributed computing', on the Internet / global level, and it really got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my gears spinning.  Is this the next step?  How far off, from there, is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'sentient' Internet? ;) Does the idea of living and working inside of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fully interactive computer (say, your house in 2020) unsettle you?  Isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this in a way conducive to the emergence of a transparent society 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(reference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the MAS [mutually assured surveillance] discussion a few months ago)?  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your house is a node on a global, distributed computing network, and one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's directives is to identify patterns in your behaviors/intentions as its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resident in order to preemptively feed you information it thinks you will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;want, doesn't that imply that information about you is going to be 'out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there', potentially everywhere?  Yeah, okay, encrypt it.  Encrypt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;everything!  But who/what holds your encryption keys in an environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;designed for constant interaction to automate the 'tediosities' of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life, including your decisions, when everybody is actually using the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;great, big computer?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cheers,
</EM><BR>

Already, I and I'm sure everyone reading this is getting these continuous 
<BR>
ads for services disguised as personal messages.  Imagine a world that 
<BR>
continuously configured itself to maximize your attention.  Those people who 
<BR>
secretly or subconsciously wanted to escape from reality could find 
<BR>
themselves like professor Moriarity on TNG, permanently ensconced in a box 
<BR>
with no further relevance to anything outside itself.  Mack Reynolds 
<BR>
actually wrote a novel on that theme sometime in the '50's or perhaps '60's, 
<BR>
as I recall.
<BR>
Of course, it could be argued that religion performs that service today.  
<BR>
Will we have wars in the future based on what reality you want?
