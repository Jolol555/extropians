<EM>&gt; Thank you for saying such an obvious thing!!  I am tired of hearing how money is not a very important part of the happiness equation! And is not really necessary beyond keeping one fed and with basic shelter!  I recommend a book to you all called &quot;Warm Hearts, Cold Cash.&quot;  It really shows the relationship between &quot;love&quot; and finances.

<EM>&gt; You, I assume, would not be happy writing a book on &quot;quantum astrology&quot;. I could make more money by selling meth, prostituting myself, or robbing people, but I would be unhappy doing so, and I have a personal rule that I would only work in an office which required me to wear a tie for at least 20% more money. Material rewards are extremely important, but nobody is saying they are the only kind.

<EM>&gt; Another answer is to get a new job. Find out what you want to do, find out what skills you need to do that, and attain those skills. Anyone, with rare

<EM>&gt; This advice is more for someone like me and not so much a migrant from the third-world with a family to support and a very limited education.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am great at thinking about things, analyzing the situation, but I either come to a complete loss on what to do about things(such as my career path), or I come up with lengthy written plans about a goal which I never actually do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My mother recently counselled me to make a decision(regarding a romantic relationship) and than ACT.  She said I tend to stumble over my feet and not take action in life.  I suppose I must sometimes make a decisive decision and live with the consequences.

<EM>&gt; That is my wish too!  I hope to operate a replicator when they are in use at the large retail store I work at!  I hope I have an easier time than I did learning to make keys...  &quot;Well Ma'am, it sort of still looks like a key, done as a Picasso sculpture!&quot;

<EM>&gt; There's a catch-22 - is it possible for someone to be implicitly superior to anyone else, via genetics or whatever? I believe that, no it is not. In rare cases, such as mental retardation, someone is at a natural disadvantage, but the fact that some retarded people are able to get jobs and make a decent

</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; And it is!!  I am not as smart as the doctor I sometimes visit, and believe me, he makes more money than I do!  There are obviously gradations of intelligence among humans and so not everyone can be an engineer, professor or programmer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I come from a family of engineers on my father's side and pharmacists, professors and m.d.'s on my mothers.  I may carry some good genes but I did not get them for myself!  Higher mathematics and science are severely troubling for me.  I would love to be able to go into a field where I could be sure of a good income.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My former state of Alaska voc rehab counselor, a very &quot;compassionate&quot; person said no moderate to severe learning disabled person had ever in her &quot;care&quot; gotten an undergraduate degree or gone to grad school.  And she said that even if they were to graduate with a master's, they would not be able to hack it in the professional world.  I found her attitude of &quot;it may be a bad investment to try&quot; rather sickening.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wound up not getting picked up by the program.  My college grades were not the B average she wanted, but that was more due to laziness, clinical depression and disorganization than my combination of learning disabilities.  Also she wanted my major to be &quot;written in stone&quot; and that bothered me since I don't know exactly what I want to do yet.  I had thought teaching but I hear so many negative things about it.

<EM>&gt; Their brightest and most ambitious children only would probably catch up.

<EM>&gt; Exactly!  Being learning disabled made my public education days hard.  I was diagnosed in the second grade and went through the slingerland program.  I had a horrible time memorizing the multiplication tables(I did, but it took forever) and my rote memory is still weak.  I remember being in classes and just not &quot;getting it&quot; in math, english or science.  I loved social studies, creative reading and writing classes, and anything taught by a certain science teacher.

<EM>&gt; Work as intellectual play?  That must be a nice way to make a living!  I sometimes have a problem with the saying that white collar workers don't actually WORK for a living!  I would think the stresses would be more mental and simply less physical.  I could see how white collar work could actually be more stressful.  But the autonomy one tends to get in at least some white collar work must be nice.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My problems so far...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1.  Clinical depression and I suspect a.d.d.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2.  Unsure of type of education and career to pursue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3.  Conflict of lifestyles/paradigms because of my religion(mormon) and transhumanist/cryonicist memes.  A part of me wants to reject one over the other, but I feel I can't do this.  I need my faith, but I need this list also.  The desire is still strong in me for finding a mate of my faith, but real conflict could arise.  &quot;Hey honey, ever hear about cryonics?&quot; lol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 4.  I have talked about becoming muscular and fit for years, but have yet to do it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5.  I realize the importance of keeping a journal but simply don't out of tiredness, laziness, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 6.  I am terribly disorganized.  I store half my stuff in boxes and garbage bags!  I have lost so many wonderful emails too.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 7.  I don't have a driver's license and suspect I may never get one.  My learning disabilities are such(bad sense of direction, traffic flow and rules sometimes confuse me) that it may be beyond me.  I feel inadequate in terms of work and dating due to this.  Anchorage is a car city with a barely adequate bus system.  Riding a bike in winter is not a smart idea to say the least.  I want to stay in Alaska I suppose to continue getting my annual dividend checks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, I have found this a fascinating thread.  Many of you are so fortunate to have been blessed with in at least some cases, good parents, or at least good genes which enable you to learn and master the difficult subjects which lead to success in our modern world.  I feel honored to read and learn from you each day.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think I am finally getting to a place where I want to move forward and change some things in my life.  I think trying out Deseryl will be phase one.  I look forward to any advice any of you may have for me.
