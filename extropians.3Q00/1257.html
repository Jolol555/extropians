<P>
You said high doses are not harmful... ?
<BR>
<P>I get palpitations from excess serotonin in the body from 5-htp even at 500 
<BR>
mg.
<BR>
<P><P>When I first wrote about things to try to stabilize someone who we
<BR>
might otherwise lose to unmanageable despair, I only had St. John's
<BR>
Wort on deck as a non-prescription medication option.  It's basically
<BR>
an SSRI with some MAO-inhibitor effects, and it shares properties
<BR>
with those prescription solutions such as long onset lag.  It's
<BR>
also toxic in high doses, and causes vastly increased
<BR>
photosensitivity.  (I got sunburn under my fingernails!)
<BR>
<P>I've learned more since then, and there have been options that I
<BR>
hadn't heard about until a series of blows recently pushed me into
<BR>
wanting an Extropian panic button.  &quot;Freeze me now!  My brain's out
<BR>
of control.&quot;  In desperation, I did a lot of research.
<BR>
<P>The most interesting thing I've uncovered is that you can buy the
<BR>
direct precursor to Serotonin over the counter.  This is by some
<BR>
strange regulatory accident in our favor, since the L-Tryptophan
<BR>
supplements were taken off the market due to one incident of a
<BR>
manufacturing problem, and 5-HTP is CLOSER to Serotonin than
<BR>
L-Tryptophan.  It's the direct precursor.  You want to make more
<BR>
5-HT? Take 5-HTP.
<BR>
<P>5-HTP is incredible stuff.  Can you believe the following?
<BR>
In one hour, a dose of 5-HTP delivers significant amounts of
<BR>
Serotonin and essentially all the claimed advantages of Prozac and
<BR>
the SSRI family.  It does this without having any effect on
<BR>
non-Serotonin synapses.   The modern antidepressants are fairly
<BR>
specific, but not this specific.
<BR>
<P>A web-search will find a wealth of offers to sell the stuff, and a
<BR>
couple of real studies.
<BR>
<P>Dosage is on the order of 300 mg. three times a day for serious
<BR>
&quot;world is black&quot; situations.   Overdosage will induce drowsiness but
<BR>
is not harmful.   I seem to be so Serotonin-starved that I never seem
<BR>
to get to the drowziness stage.   This stuff is much less convenient
<BR>
than a once-a-day dose of Prozac, and it does produce some stomach
<BR>
irritation, it's not mana from heaven, except that it is.
<BR>
<P>I say keep some in the medicine chest, even if no one in your
<BR>
household needs it right now.   I don't believe that you can hurt
<BR>
someone by feeding them even high doses of this stuff.
<BR>
