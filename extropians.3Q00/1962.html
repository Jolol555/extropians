<EM>&gt;     &gt;ABM defenses are not just for use against Ballistic Missiles,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;but any airborn platform, be it ballistic missiles, cruise missiles,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;jets, piper cubs, or balloons...

<EM>&gt; For the life of me I don't see how a system optimized to shoot down ICBM's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could have anything to do with shooting down slow low flying cruise missiles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the record I like cruise missiles much better than ICBM's, they seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like a cheap and efficient method of delivering warheads, second only to UPS.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cruise missiles are cheap and efficient, if you can get your launch platform in
<BR>
range without being detected. Using a standard commercial cargo ship or tanker
<BR>
as a launch platform in a surprise attack will work exactly ONE time. However,
<BR>
it must also be stealthed, otherwise it WILL be intercepted at some point. THe
<BR>
USAF's air defense radars ARE sweeping the skies all around the US, and are very
<BR>
good at spotting aircraft that don't respond with current and correct IFF codes
<BR>
or respond to radio hails. If a cruise missile is going to penetrate the US, it
<BR>
either needs to be stealthed, or else it needs and AI and a good IFF unit to
<BR>
deceive military and civilian air traffic controllers that it is a civil
<BR>
aircraft. IFF technology is being upgraded all the time, and acceptable key
<BR>
signals change every day.
<BR>
<P>Frankly, using cessna 172 aircraft is a much better idea, because it looks like
<BR>
a plane, IS a plane, and is capable of being fitted with GPS autopilots. Set up
<BR>
a container ship as an aircraft carrier, with the flight deck being quick
<BR>
deployed like those developed to be set up on bomb damaged runways, on top of
<BR>
the top layer of containers, storing your 172 aircraft (with custom folding
<BR>
wings) in the containers. The takeoff assisted by a trebuchet-like sling device
<BR>
on the foredeck, and controlled by radio control pilots on board ship who fly
<BR>
the launched planes up to altitude and start the autopilots (you could also have
<BR>
them in the planes on launch, and parachute back to the ship once the autopilot
<BR>
has been set.)
