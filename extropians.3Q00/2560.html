<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: SOC/BIO: Rifkin's &quot;worldwide moratorium&quot; on genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; modified  organisms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sellafield? Nothing.
</EM><BR>
<P>BNFL has paid out millions of pounds in compensation to its workers for a
<BR>
range of cancers, including leukemia, on a probability of just 20% that the
<BR>
cancers were caused by radiation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;TMI? Not one fatality. Chernobyl? A system purposely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overloaded with all safety systems turned off, as some sort of stupid
</EM><BR>
'test' by
<BR>
<EM>&gt;your socialist buddies. The lesson of Chernobyl is that socialists can't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trusted with nuclear power. The lesson of TMI is that US nuclear plants are
</EM><BR>
safe
<BR>
<EM>&gt;systems even under the worst failure conditions.
</EM><BR>
<P>If socialists/ 3rd world countries can't be trusted, then they shouldn't be
<BR>
built! Chernobyl affected quite a few (non-socialist) countries as well
<BR>
..... there was a ban on consumption even of British lamb directly because
<BR>
of it for several years.
<BR>
<P>Are you telling me that there are no stupid jerks/ human incompetents in the
<BR>
USA (no matter what their politics)?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So the safety of tests *can't* be guaranteed then?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Nothing in life is guaranteed. Get out of your cradle and give up the
</EM><BR>
safety
<BR>
<EM>&gt;blankee. Mommy ain't nursing you no more.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, am not disagreeing that the world is a dangerous place ..... but I
<BR>
don't want
<BR>
prats I don't even know making it *unnecessarily* more dangerous.
<BR>
The greens that you hate are just taking steps on their own behalf against
<BR>
what they feel is a direct
<BR>
threat to their survival ... not relying on some governmental nanny safety
<BR>
blanket.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, so you question the motives of &quot;greenies&quot; who may have left-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; politics. But for sure the motives of Monsanto and the big
</EM><BR>
agri-businesses
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pushing this GM thru as fast they can *ARE* motivated solely by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; self-interest and financial gain.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is your reply to this point?
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;How do you know what their interests are? Their stockholders are interested
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt;making money, surely, or else they would not be investing in those
</EM><BR>
companies. I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;fail to see why such an obviously obsolete socialist argument needs any
</EM><BR>
reply,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;at least on this list.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obvious point ..... yes, even you seem to accept &quot;stockholders are
<BR>
interested in making money.&quot;
<BR>
But only an *obsolete* argument if wrong ... are you claiming that Monsanto
<BR>
are acting out of altruism??
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Which has shown tons of evidence that it is perfectly safe there. Humans
</EM><BR>
have
<BR>
<EM>&gt;been introducing genetically modified agricultural species into the
</EM><BR>
environment
<BR>
<EM>&gt;for millennia. The only difference between then and now is then we were
</EM><BR>
rolling
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the dice with the genes in our breeding programs, while now we have a very
</EM><BR>
exact
<BR>
<EM>&gt;idea of what we are getting. Its quite clear that GE programs are far safer
</EM><BR>
than
<BR>
<EM>&gt;the hybridization programs humans have been running for thousands of years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anyone who knows ANYTHING about agriculture knows that.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I think one danger of GM strains is it will lead to monoculture ... the new
<BR>
GM seeds might well replace the variety of (less efficient yielding)
<BR>
strains, and cut down on biodiversity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What is your answer to the question, though??? What is permaculture?
</EM><BR>
<P>From: <A HREF="http://csf.colorado.edu/perma/">http://csf.colorado.edu/perma/</A>
<BR>
<P>Permaculture values and validates traditional knowledge and experience.
<BR>
Permaculture incorporates sustainable agriculture practices and land
<BR>
management techniques and strategies from around the world. Permaculture is
<BR>
a bridge between traditional cultures and emergent earth-tuned cultures.
<BR>
<P>Permaculture promotes organic agriculture which does not use pesticides to
<BR>
pollute the environment.
<BR>
<P>Permaculture aims to maximize symbiotic and synergistic relationships
<BR>
between site components.
<BR>
<P>Permaculture is urban planning as well as rural land design.
<BR>
<P>Permaculture design is site specific, client specific, and culture specific.

<BR>
<P>Due to the inherent sustainability of perennial cropping systems,
<BR>
permaculture places a heavy emphasis on tree crops. Systems that integrate
<BR>
annual and perennial crops-such as alley cropping and agroforestry-take
<BR>
advantage of &quot;the edge effect,&quot; increase biological diversity, and offer
<BR>
other characteristics missing in mono- culture systems. Thus, multicropping
<BR>
systems that blend woody perennials and annuals hold promise as viable
<BR>
techniques for large-scale farming. Ecological methods of production for any
<BR>
specific crop or farming system (e.g., soil building practices, biological
<BR>
pest control, composting) are central to permaculture as well as to
<BR>
sustainable agriculture in general.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps.
