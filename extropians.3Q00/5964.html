to predict what you will or will not do? Can you use that knowledge to

absolutely 100% exclude an action or a sequence of actions?
<BR>
<P>&quot;Computers only do what they've been programmed to do.&quot; Yeah,
<BR>
right. And all matter does is follow Schroedinger's equation. Both
<BR>
statements are true, and contain about the same amount of predictive

power. &quot;Computers only do what they've been programmed to do&quot; is as
<BR>
applicable to a complex adaptive AI system (we don't have these yet)
<BR>
as Schroedinger's equation is useful in building an animal cell model.

<P>Then we agree. It doesn't take more than a bee's brain to drive around

a car, so I'm not worried about it getting airs and vapours and
<BR>
driving off to plot with it's four-wheeled brethren. Anything much

smarter, and open-ended, and you're asking for trouble.
