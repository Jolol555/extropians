</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not to get holy-roller on anyone here, but I agree with Samatha's conjecture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that if there is no God, then there is certainly room for one in a Universe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that includes suffering. What Samantha gets when she &quot;recieves a lift&quot; from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading certain religious tracts is one of the religious experiences
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; described by 19th century psychologist Willam James.  Having a God module is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good if it connects one up with a sense of a better ethical system. If it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leads only to the Inquisition torture chamber, then it's a bad bet.  So I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking 'outcomes' here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't particular get a lift from religious tracts.  Not most of them
<BR>
anyway.  There is a lot of drivel in that field and a lot of
<BR>
second,third and fourth hand stuff. Only a few mystic texts, stories,
<BR>
quotes hit the right buttons that connect with whatever this is and then
<BR>
not always. But the buttons get pressed sometimes quite spontaneously
<BR>
and out of the blue.  Other times I notice that my thoughts turned along
<BR>
certain lines and/or certain emotions reified along certain directions
<BR>
or a semi-lucid dream invoked a pattern - then it is off to the races. 
<BR>
Often it will be fired by things that appear to have zero religious
<BR>
content.  
<BR>
<P>The first time I remember it happening was when I was 5 years old.  I
<BR>
was examining a common everyday clothespin, the kind with the coiled
<BR>
spring and the two pieces of wood.  I was fascinated by its design and
<BR>
action.  As I played with it my mind ran around the loops of its spring
<BR>
and its levers. Suddenly I &quot;grokked&quot; it.  That kicked a whole sheaf of
<BR>
images and understandings about different pieces of physics, properties
<BR>
of metals, usages of those properties and principles, possible
<BR>
inventions, implications, on and on it flew while I quite lost track of
<BR>
&quot;me&quot;.  Most of it was in concept/picture/feeling/intuition form I had no
<BR>
words for at all at that age and barely grasped the tiniest part of as
<BR>
it flew threw me. And overarching all of it was this transcendent
<BR>
being-ness.  I remember/falling sitting down very hard and fast as I had
<BR>
been standing when this happened.  When it was over I tried to invoke it
<BR>
again but I could not.  Very powerful and haunting.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ultimately, it may turn out that some advanced primate species (humans) once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had a God module as part of their brain, and it helped them develop computers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that colonized the cosmos, which in the end leads to an ultimate Mind (God)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which fixed things that needed fixing (since it has ultimate computing power)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and help resurrect people such as Samantha! This is more inspired from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reading of Julian Barbour (The End of Time)  as well as Tipler and Barrow's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Final Anthropic Principle. Talk amongst yourselves, i'm getting ver-klempt!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (sob!)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think everyone here has one thing in common with many sincerely
<BR>
religious people.  That is the deep burning desire to transcend human
<BR>
limits.  It is a core leitmotif in humanity and has come out (much more
<BR>
profitably and cleanly at last) in science and technology as well as in
<BR>
religions.  I remember when I first heard the word &quot;omniscient&quot; when I
<BR>
was 10 or 11.  I didn't think of it as some impossible attribute of some
<BR>
impossibly remote being, real or imagined.  I thought of it as simply a
<BR>
reasonable and exciting goal.  But it was definitely another key that
<BR>
drew me inexorably to computers when the opportunity came along some
<BR>
years later.
<BR>
<P>Ever play with the notion that somewhere in this Universe some species
<BR>
of intelligent being may well have kicked off a Singularity and created
<BR>
one or more Singularity class intelligences?  If they did who is to say
<BR>
that such Powers may not occassionally tickle the minds and cultures of
<BR>
developing species with ideas/images/memes leading to the creation of
<BR>
others of their kind  and/or preparing for the acknowledgement of the
<BR>
existing ones?  For that matter are we totally certain that our own
<BR>
Singularity will never have the ability to reach backward in time and
<BR>
influence the smoothness and particulars of its own becoming?  What if
<BR>
some of the trascendent glimmerings of what most call God or Void or
<BR>
whatever are actually forebodings and/or backward or external reachings
<BR>
of such?  Wildly speculative I know. Probably impossible to test or
<BR>
falsify.  But something I can't rule out.
<BR>
<P>It might even be a key useful in understanding and even pulling into
<BR>
some cooperation the world's religions.
