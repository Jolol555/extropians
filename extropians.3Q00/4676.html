<P>
Well, since Greg asked the question and Mike and Eugene
<BR>
offered a couple of responses (very informative responses,
<BR>
but IMO wrong), I'll throw my 2 cents worth into the pot.
<BR>
<P>The Dark Horse will win the race...
<BR>
<P>Mike offered up a list of current technologies but missed
<BR>
several such a Cadmium Telluride, see:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/documents/thinfilm.html">http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/documents/thinfilm.html</A>
<BR>
and the bibliography at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/eshbib.html">http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/eshbib.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Also missing is CuInSe2, being manufactured by Siemens
<BR>
apparently.  See
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/solar/comparing_pv_arrays.htm">http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/solar/comparing_pv_arrays.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>While the efficiency on the thin film arrays is poor, the
<BR>
manufacturing cost advantages may win out.  The area
<BR>
of most American roofs is large and if you can roll out
<BR>
electricity collectors as thin as plastic sheets on them
<BR>
you have a big win.  Europe and Japan might have to go
<BR>
an alternate route.
<BR>
<P>Now, then Mike in a burst of &quot;go Space&quot; enthusiasm, chimes
<BR>
in with:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How things will fall out is that by 2030 solar power sats will start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting built, and an orbital network of MASER power transmission
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; systems will transport energy to key sites on each continent. Prime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; location for the power sats will be at the Sun-earth L2 point, where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the sats will also act to reduce total flux reaching earth, thus helping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to offset any global warming effects whether they 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a result of pollution or Malenkovich Cycles. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fossil fuels will continue to be used for transportation beyond this point,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but not for static uses, although work will be done on using reverse fuel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells to produce natural gas from electricity. Hydrogen will NOT be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuel of choice, due to its corrosive properties and low density. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Rasberries...
<BR>
<P>First of all if we don't have diamondoid nanotech by 2030, I will
<BR>
publically eat a hat (cotton please) at Extro 19 (assuming it is after
<BR>
2030).  If we have diamondoid nanotech, then space power satellites become
<BR>
irrelevant.  (We will have the entire power output of the sun
<BR>
at our or &quot;someones&quot; disposal.)
<BR>
<P>Eugene had a closer hit with his comments related to home based fuel cells.
<BR>
There are lots of sources of methane and ways to produce it from biomass
<BR>
or the sun.  Fuel cell developers are pushing hard to get the sizes
<BR>
and costs down to something home owners would install (ala heat pumps).
<BR>
If the costs come down enough home owners will install these
<BR>
as an alternate energy source (avoiding brownouts that will
<BR>
strike the nationwide or global distribution nets because they
<BR>
don't build enough reserve capacity for extreme situations)
<BR>
then this may become Greg's solution to putting a smile on
<BR>
your face when the sun is roasting you (I may be hot but at
<BR>
least money is flowing into my bank account...).
<BR>
<P>Worth noting is -- if you trust the nationwide &quot;grid&quot; approach then why
<BR>
are companies in California, such as Oracle, building their own power
<BR>
facilities?
<BR>
<P>Homes can afford to lose power -- eBusinesses cannot!
<BR>
<P>Now, since I've just finished my sometimes discussed about in hushed
<BR>
whispers business plan for the development of biotech based
<BR>
self-replicating systems I'll toss my vote in for the *dark horse*.
<BR>
<P>The *dark horse* will be based on light harvesting methods
<BR>
currently found in plants.  Once these systems are cloned
<BR>
and available as easily manipulated laboratory tools, scientists
<BR>
will develop energy harvesting, storage and production systems
<BR>
based on biotechnology based self-replicating systems.
<BR>
<P>This solves the problems of production costs, capital costs,
<BR>
etc. that have plagued other renewable energy sources.  This
<BR>
will not be simple, but the payoff is big! Really big! -- being able
<BR>
to &quot;paint on&quot; your power generation system that is self-organizing,
<BR>
self-repairing and entirely local (producing revenue if it is connected
<BR>
to the grid...) argue that this is the way to go.
<BR>
<P>Self-Replicating systems beat overcoming gravity.  No contest.
<BR>
<P>The market is clear -- you can have grass that you have to mow
<BR>
or you can have grass that pumps excess energy into the grid.
<BR>
Which do you prefer?
<BR>
<P>Mike, go back and do the calculations on how many sq meters of lawn
<BR>
are required to supply the electricty needs of a city like New York.
<BR>
I suspect the suburbanites win...
<BR>
<P>While I would love to see the energy storage and retrieval aspects solved by
<BR>
high temperature superconductors, I suspect that they will first be
<BR>
solved by biotech (with horrible losses compensated for by the large
<BR>
collection areas enabled by self-replicating systems) and the subsequently
<BR>
improved upon by much more efficient systems based on diamondoid nanotech.
<BR>
<P>Sorry if I burst any balloons.
<BR>
<P>Robert
