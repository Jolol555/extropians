<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice to quibble over such things, but how should citizenship be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conferred?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; And should noncitizens be subject to the government, if one believes in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; government with the consent of the governed?  (If one does not, that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; another story.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; While one could say that the nation having an open immigration policy with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; regard to outgoing traffic, anyone who doesn't leave is consenting to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; governed by those in charge, i.e. the old 'voting with their feet' gambit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree.  But, again, if you are willing to go down this road, I suppose,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then, you support every policy of all ruling cliques in Washington and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Laconia during your lifetime.  Well, do you?
</EM><BR>
<P>Of course not, but then again, none of their decisions have impacted me
<BR>
personally on anything but a minor incremental level, which is of course, part
<BR>
of the lobster cooking strategem toward tyranny. I have engaged in political
<BR>
activism, just as non-citizens are permitted to do even though they cannot vote.
<BR>
If you cannot vote, but to talk other people into voting the way you would like
<BR>
to, would you not consider that some sort of surrogate representation?
<BR>
<P>BTW, where do you get Laconia? Concord is our state capital, and the political
<BR>
leaders tend to be well distributed between Portsmouth/Durham, Manchester,
<BR>
Nashua, Lebanon/Hanover, Berlin, and Keene.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; policy seems to work within the 50 states, as the various state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; governments tend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to get distressed if there is a high rate of taxpayers leaving their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; state for greener pastures (unless, of course, those leaving tend to be of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; welfare class). Thus a non-citizen who stays here, when they could leave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; any time, is in actuality consenting to be taxed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem would be, here, the need for that sort of policy on the national
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level too.  It also doesn't work if, say, you're for polygamy and all fifty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; states are against it.  Or if the central government decides to tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone, which it currently does.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, though it actually does not tax everyone directly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Taxing a non-citizen 'legally' could take many forms, for example,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; imposing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expatriation tariffs on money sent by non-citizens out of the country to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; relatives elsewhere would not be a direct tax on their income, but on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their 'gift' to others.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But all of these are mere legal niceities.  They do not speak to the spirit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of government by consent of the governed.  They merely set up euphamisms to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ease consciences.
</EM><BR>
<P>However your allegation that non-citizens not having representation is somehow
<BR>
equal to the situation of the revolutionary period, where Americans, who were in
<BR>
fact British Citizens/ Subjects, were being taxed by Acts passed in a Parliament
<BR>
they did not have any representation in, is a false one, since the first group
<BR>
are non-citizens, while the second group were citizens. Also your dismissal of
<BR>
the distinction between direct and indirect taxation is unfounded. The Stamp Act
<BR>
and the Tea Act which helped to trigger the revolt in New England were different
<BR>
types of taxes. The Stamp Act was a taxation on freedom of the press, a direct
<BR>
tax on an individuals recognised God given right. The Tea Act was an indirect
<BR>
tax on the importation of tea. The Boston Tea Party was essentially saying,&quot;If
<BR>
we can't speak our minds freely, we don't need your tea either.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Additionally, the INS does tend to encourage resident aliens who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; productive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; taxpayers to become citizens. Sasha, for example, had told me he was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; becoming a citizen for a few years, but was unsure the potential tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantages
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of remaining in his current position (since he had been exiled from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; USSR,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which no longer existed, he was actually not a citizen of any country,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sure drove the INS to distraction, as they would have no place to deport
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if he ever became a liability, and bureaucrats hate quantum people.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was under the belief that deportation was to wherever one arrived from.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps I'm wrong here...
</EM><BR>
<P>Except that while Sasha was here, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and even if
<BR>
he were deported, they would have to agree to accept him anyways. Since he was
<BR>
never a citizen of an independent Russia, he would have been hard pressed to go
<BR>
home.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But Thomas does care.  Note how before he was appointed, he was very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; for Natural Law, but during the appointment process he turned into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pragmatist very quickly.  I guess his avowed principles were only so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; window dressing.  (Or, if he's returned to them, they are only to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; held
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; when they are convenient.)  This tells me he is not independent minded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; just caters to a different audience than the NAACP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know where you get any of this. What is your rationale for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Didn't you watch the hearings?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, as I recall, Thomas did not abandon his Natural Law leanings, but was
<BR>
trying to explain his logic in terms that the liberal Senators could understand.
