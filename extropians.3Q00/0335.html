<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've been making a list of the reasons why I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people are prone to believe in deities.  This has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably been covered before but I missed it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What have I left out?  or how might I clarify these?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>14. A wish that people who have more then us, or get away with more then us, 
<BR>
will eventually be punished. It's comforting for many people to believe 
<BR>
&quot;sure, that guy who killed my dad got away without getting caught, but we'll 
<BR>
see who has regrets when he's burning in hell&quot;, or replace &quot;that guy who 
<BR>
killed my dad&quot; with &quot;Bill Gates&quot;.. and add the fact that you can claim that 
<BR>
your poverty, lack of motivation, and inability to defend yourself as 
<BR>
strenghts (&quot;the meek shall inherit the earth&quot;, &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;, and 
<BR>
the already talked about camel verse).
<BR>
<P>15. The reason people *keep* believing, even when all evidence suggests 
<BR>
otherwise, is that they have invested so much of their selves. They've gone 
<BR>
to church every sunday, based important life decisions on their belief, and 
<BR>
in some cases given quite a bit of money in tithings. I think it's analogous 
<BR>
to when you hold a stock which is just tanking, and you've put so much money 
<BR>
in it, and lost so much, and you just want so bad for it to turn around, and 
<BR>
you're sure it's hit bottom.. as long as you hold it, there's a possibility 
<BR>
for a turn around, but once you sell it, you've lost.
