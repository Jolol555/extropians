While in France last week, I finished reading
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Five Ages of the Universe&quot;,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by Fred Adams and Greg Laughlin, Touchstone, 1999
<BR>
which is a comprehensible interpretation of the hard-physics paper Anders
<BR>
first mentioned (and I subsequently referenced) regarding the evolution
<BR>
and eventual end of the universe.
<BR>
<P>The good news is the book is very readable and pretty optimistic
<BR>
for future possibilities.  We can clearly get through the stelliferous
<BR>
era (10^14 years), and if dark matter is real, probably the degenerate
<BR>
era (10^39th years), though at a much reduced computation rate, and
<BR>
perhaps even the black hole era (10^100 years).
<BR>
<P>They fail to delve into the possibilities SIs &quot;saving&quot; hydrogen
<BR>
for controlled burning after the stelliferous era, or SI engineering
<BR>
to prevent the proton decay of the degenerate era, or what happens
<BR>
if there is no &quot;real&quot; dark matter.  However, they make up for it with
<BR>
a fairly wild scheme for building computers out of black holes
<BR>
(though they compute pretty slowly...).  They even toss a coin or two
<BR>
at generating escape universes.
<BR>
<P>They also dump a fair amount of cold water on contracting universes,
<BR>
have only a single reference for Tipler and don't discuss the
<BR>
Omega-point Theory at all, presumably being unworthy of consideration
<BR>
given our current knowledge of the universe.
<BR>
<P>Though I haven't read the entire Omega-point discussion, I'd urge
<BR>
those people who have a problem with it to have people read this book.
<BR>
It rests on a hard-core physical view of the universe as it is currently
<BR>
perceived today (with only some &quot;minor&quot; stretching vis-a-vis the dark
<BR>
matter and lifetime of the proton [for which only theoretical arguments
<BR>
currently exist]).
<BR>
<P>If future editions get extended to include some of the concepts we
<BR>
frequently discuss, then we will have a nice framework on which to
<BR>
rest many extropian perspectives.
<BR>
<P>I'd urge adding this book to the EI booklist as &quot;approved&quot;
<BR>
reading material.
