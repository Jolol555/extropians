<P><EM>&gt; Of course at this stage in our ignorance a great many scenarios are plausible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One key question is how diversified individual portfolios are - if well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; diversified, especially out of their personal wage, then most people benefit.
</EM><BR>
<P>Can we get a sense today of how much diversification is necessary in order
<BR>
to benefit from such a change?  I found a statistic:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, 76 million Americans, members of 43 percent of U.S.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;households, own stocks or stock mutual funds. This represents a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;126 percent increase in shareholding over 15 years.
<BR>
<P>Of course this doesn't say how much of their assets are involved in
<BR>
stock ownership; probably a relatively small amount for most people.
<BR>
But if these growth rates continue then there could be a large number
<BR>
of people who have substantial assets invested in the market by the
<BR>
time uploads were a factor.
<BR>
<P>Is this enough?  Will all companies benefit, or will only the few
<BR>
companies which actually develop the technology manage to retain the
<BR>
lion's share of the profits?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Another key question is how much international politics tolerates losers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If one nation can allow uploads and make most of their citizens rich,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; how hard will other nations try to prevent them from doing this?
</EM><BR>
<P>By this you mean, a nation whose citizens had widely diversified
<BR>
investments, so that most people would benefit financially from the
<BR>
introduction of uploads to take over most forms of labor?  (Rather,
<BR>
most people except the uploads, I guess...)
