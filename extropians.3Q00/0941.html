<EM>&gt; &gt;since the advent of health insurance and scientifically based health care,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the percent of the population with poor eyesight has increased dramatically.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Such people would have previously died off early due to accident,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predation, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;battle.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yep, all those feeble 4-eyed Nobel prize winners and their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spectacle-equipped postdocs would be expunged from the gene pool. What a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pity the uberhealthy have to put up with the presence of those wimps!
</EM><BR>
<P>Taking things out of context as usual.
<BR>
<P>My point is not to object to this phenonmenon on an individual basis, as you so
<BR>
'knee jerk' defensively seem to assume, but to point out that this trend in and
<BR>
of itself is also on an exponential curve toward a genomic singularity, where
<BR>
eventually the entire human race will devolve into rather wasted, malformed,
<BR>
stunted individuals unless we DO push for allowing individuals to practice
<BR>
genetic therapies on the fetuses they choose to bring to term, and on the
<BR>
children they already have. This is a very good argument to use in support of GE
<BR>
and GM technologies against the luddites. Those that refuse to practice these
<BR>
technologies in the future doom their descendants to an eventual gnomish/morlock
<BR>
existence, while those that do will maintain and improve they health and
<BR>
vitality of their bodies and genomes.
<BR>
<P>I fully understand that your fears are that I was espousing some sort of
<BR>
eugenics to 'wipe out' 'your kind'. That is not the case, as you should know
<BR>
that I highly respect your writing. My position is that parents should be able
<BR>
to fix recessive defects like eyesight deficiencies in vitro. I would love the
<BR>
idea that you could have had the chance to enjoy the world without dependency on
<BR>
an inhaler or glasses. It might even improve your writing as good as it is
<BR>
already...
