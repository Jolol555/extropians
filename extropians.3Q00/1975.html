<P>Why, I'm glad you asked that question.
<BR>
<P>The potential function V changes with the temperature of the Universe, and
<BR>
it is this that induces the phase transition, as it becomes energetically
<BR>
favourable for the state of the field to change when the Universe cools
<BR>
sufficiently. In the language of thermodynamics, the potential V() plays
<BR>
the role of the free energy of the system. A graph of V() will typically
<BR>
have a minimum somewhere, and that minimum value determines the value of
<BR>
which is stable at a given temperature. Imagine an inverted parabola with
<BR>
its minimum value at  = 0; the configuration of the field can be
<BR>
represented as the position of a ball rolling on this curve. In the stable
<BR>
configuration it nestles in the bottom of the potential well at  = 0. This
<BR>
might represent the potential V() at very high temperatures, way above the
<BR>
phase transition. The vacuum is then in its most symmetrical state. What
<BR>
happens as the phase transition proceeds is that the shape of V() changes
<BR>
so that it develops additional minima. Initially these `false' minima may
<BR>
be at higher values of V() than the original, but as the temperature
<BR>
continues to fall and the shape of the curve changes further, the new
<BR>
minima can be at lower values of V than the original one. This happens at a
<BR>
critical temperature Tc at which the vacuum state of the Universe begins to
<BR>
prefer one of the alternative minima to the original one. 
<BR>
<P>The transition does not occur instantaneously. How it proceeds depends on
<BR>
the shape of the potential, and this in turn determines whether the
<BR>
transition is first or second order. If the phase transition is second
<BR>
order it moves rather smoothly, and fairly large `domains' of the new phase
<BR>
are generated (much like the Weiss domains in a ferromagnet). One such
<BR>
region (bubble or domain) eventually ends up including our local patch of
<BR>
the Universe. If the potential is such that the transition is first order,
<BR>
the new phase appears as bubbles nucleating within the false vacuum
<BR>
background; these then grow and coalesce so as to fill space with the new
<BR>
phase when the transition is complete. 
<BR>
<P>Inflation arises when the potential term V greatly exceeds the kinetic term
<BR>
U in the action of the scalar field. In a phase transition this usually
<BR>
means that the vacuum must move relatively slowly from its original state
<BR>
into the final state. 
<BR>
<P>No, sorry, I'm cheating horribly, and plagiarising to boot. That (with the
<BR>
symbols fubar'd in the phase transition to email) is from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Glossary/Essay_inun.html">http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Glossary/Essay_inun.html</A> which I
<BR>
found in about three seconds of googling. Go thou and do likewise.
