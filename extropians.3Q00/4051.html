<P>
I just wanted to say publicly how good it felt to go over the website of the Singularity Institute.  Over the year(s) since I have been reading Eliezer's posts I have sensed his strong desire and even perhaps frustration at wanting so badly to create such a noble organization but not being at that point yet.  Now, in partnership with Brian and Sabine his dream is coming true.  
<BR>
<P>from the website:
<BR>
The charitable purpose of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence is to create that world - the best imaginable world permitted by physical law and the maintenance of individual rights - through the agency of self-enhancing, and eventually superintelligent, friendly Artificial Intelligence.  The material consequences of complete success would be tremendous, far out of proportion to the necessary material efforts, but the chain of events described appears to be physically possible.  According to our current understanding of physical reality, the material action of creating a friendly Artificial Intelligence capable of self-improvement and humanlike general cognition should result in the greatest imaginable benefit to humankind. 
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>My warmest wishes to all the founders of the Singularity Institute.  May your great and lofty goals be realized sooner than we might think...
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John
