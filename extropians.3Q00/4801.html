<EM>&gt; &gt; Houston we've most definitively got a problem.

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Rather I think that a more intellectual approach is needed, and a move away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from activism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Views?

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't dissagree more. All that Extropy has been to date is an intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exercise by some professional scholars and their armchair adherents. Our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; positions get pummelled in the media without opposition by any extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activists whatsoever. There is no extropian activist organization, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundraising mechanism. We could not possibly be any farther from activism than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we are now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not activists indeed...  Othe rpeopel have commented about the strong 
<BR>
libertarian thread that runs throught his discussion - as I asked in another 
<BR>
post, what is the relevance of the guns discussion to extropianism?  As far as
<BR>
I know, we are one of the larger public faces of extropianism - and here we 
<BR>
sit around and bash democracy and government, and harp on gun rights that are 
<BR>
enjoyed almsot nowhere else in the world.  
<BR>
<P>I would imagine an &quot;activist Extropian&quot; would be espousing and acting in a more
<BR>
future-oriented method, e.g. lobbying for funding into age research, cloning,
<BR>
stem cell research, increased funding for pure science research, against NASA
<BR>
budget cuts, for things sch as the privitization of space exploration, etc.
<BR>
They wouldn't be sitting around complaining so much about gun laws.  That's 
<BR>
what the NRA is for.
<BR>
<P>For many, judging from the volume of posts, libertarianism and extropianism go
<BR>
hand in hand.  But it is not the sort of thing that is written in stone.
<BR>
Extropianism could develop its own form of political philosophy, though 
<BR>
primarily we're more interested in the notion of futurist development rather
<BR>
than current political events except where they intersect our goals.
<BR>
<P>Here's an idea - an extropian charity.  We have a few Foundations already; 
<BR>
let's work to try and come up with a fund to either &quot;adopt a researcher&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;adopt a test subject&quot;, helping pay for the costs of drugs or treatment for
<BR>
the subject of, say, anti-aging research, or for some of the laboratory 
<BR>
equipment, publishing fees, etc. for a researcher.  This could expand further
<BR>
as more money became available - and it would be an unequivocal statement of
<BR>
our position in the War on Death.
