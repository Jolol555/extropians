<P>I more or less agree with you, Paul. There is no doubt a near-religious 
<BR>
fervor and self-righteousness to the way some of the people on this list 
<BR>
react to challenges to their ideas.
<BR>
<P>In regards to govt, they are really Luddites, in a sense. I see govt as our 
<BR>
greatest tool, but one that we must control. If you have a good tool, e.g., 
<BR>
electricity, but one with the potential to kill you, if someone is careless, 
<BR>
and is killed by electricity, do you just abandon the tool?  I am sure there 
<BR>
were many Luddites in the 19th Cent who called for the abolishment of 
<BR>
electricity because people were killed by it.
<BR>
<P>As for the poor, the libertarian anti-gov't freeemarketeers do not seem to 
<BR>
realize that in a competitive free market system, inherently, half the 
<BR>
competitiors must wind up in the bottom half, either through their own 
<BR>
shortcomings, or by dint of *circumstance*. Naturally, those whose 
<BR>
background and upbringing puts them in the upper half of society
<BR>
somehow seem to think that they arrived there by virtue of their own 
<BR>
personal qualities. How very human.
<BR>
<P>The freemarketeers seem to take a &quot;let them eat cake&quot; attitude, but seem to 
<BR>
have forgetten the other side of the coin: The losers in that system still 
<BR>
have the power to inflict damage upon the winners. Does the phrase &quot;off with 
<BR>
their heads&quot; ring a bell?
<BR>
<P>You see, the &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; part of govt is essentially a 
<BR>
bargain with the losers, in order to keep certain heads upon certain 
<BR>
shoulders. This the fundamental basis for *most* human rights. Why do 
<BR>
animals such as the cow seem to be lacking the same rights accorded humans 
<BR>
beings? Because they *cannot* cut off our frigging heads. Ergo they suffer 
<BR>
as our slaves. Were they able to take such self-protective actions, they 
<BR>
would suddenly be accorded all *sorts* of rights. But until then...
<BR>
<P>However, as a person who wants to live forever, I think libertarian 
<BR>
freemarketeerism may be an important part of reaching this goal. But it is 
<BR>
only a tool, subordinate to the ultimate goal. Don't forget that, please. 
<BR>
Ditch the religion.
<BR>
<P>THe readers of this list purportedly also want to live forever. Will you so 
<BR>
willingly *abandon* our most powerful tool? Seize the power, the power of 
<BR>
the ultimate tool. Turn it to *our* goals. Unless and until we do such, we 
<BR>
are simply pawns in the grasp of cruel biology.
