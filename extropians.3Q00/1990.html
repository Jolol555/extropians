<P><EM>&gt; Shakespeare'(snip)wasn't afraid to go for the cheap laugh of a dirty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; joke or a pun where needed, and his brilliant use of language
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; and poetic form wasn't to challenge his audience's mind, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; simply to entertain them.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Incorrect take on Shakespeare, yet at the same time, I agree 100% with you in 
<BR>
principle in your intent.  Why Incorrect? One: I think Shakespeare's work was 
<BR>
an ongoing, work-in-progress, group improvisational effort, not one man who 
<BR>
wrote scripts. It survives today as an amalgamation of ideas of many 
<BR>
brilliant minds, distilled if you will, into scripts. Two: I think it did 
<BR>
challenge a portion of the audiences mind, to the highest intent, while at 
<BR>
the same time lowering it's sights to amuse the most tiresome of dolts with 
<BR>
fart jokes and delightfully bad puns. So: The people who paid a farthing and 
<BR>
had no education saw a completely different play from the two penny royalty, 
<BR>
who knew the political innuendo and tongue in cheek philosophical wordplay. 
<BR>
This multilevel inventiveness - where people of all levels are indulged - to 
<BR>
the extent that they will pay - is, indeed, the most brilliant type of art, 
<BR>
though I'd shy away from terms like &quot;high and low&quot; since Shakespeare was 
<BR>
both. As are many of today's pop art forms, such as film, pop art, 
<BR>
commercials and music. 
<BR>
<P>To be more blunt about it, I think that &quot;really good art&quot; often evolves out 
<BR>
of financial need, and you are correct: to reach people, if that is your 
<BR>
goal, makes your art far more interesting, multileveled and vibrant. You are 
<BR>
often forced to refine your talents and get better and better at what you do 
<BR>
to survive. But also you run the risk of lowering your standard to meet the 
<BR>
taste of dolts. This is more common IMO than the example of Shakespeare. If 
<BR>
you don't believe me, go turn on the radio and see what I mean.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt;He juggled the language like a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; street performer juggles torches, as deftly and for the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; purpose.  /That/ is the highest form of art.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>There's a difference between financial success based on quality and self 
<BR>
propelling sales. 
<BR>
<P>You know, Steven King used to write page turners, real oddball stuff, but he 
<BR>
reached a plateau - and lately he has been putting the same old shit in every 
<BR>
book. The same stupid fat retired cop, fat religious ladies in stretch pants, 
<BR>
slobbering preadolescent kids, a cowboy hotshot, a slutty teen girl and old 
<BR>
hippy guy appear in every single novel or novella. I am sure Shakespeare also 
<BR>
did crap, it just didn't survive until today.
<BR>
<P>IMO, today's market can endure a lot more crap, as long as it's packaged 
<BR>
well. 
<BR>
MacStevenKing burgers would sell great, I bet, if you put a couple action 
<BR>
figures of N'Sync with the Happy Crappy Scary McMeal. Byte on that.

<P><EM>&gt;  Unfortunately art truly -is- nebulous... not because of some sort of hocus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pocus, but due to the simple fact that it is necessarily subjective.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Sigh.. yes, to the extent that we cannot all agree on taste, yet as we have 
<BR>
pointed out time and time again, there are standards, and those standards can 
<BR>
be measured.
<BR>
Just you or I liking something doesn't make it &quot;good&quot; any more than me saying 
<BR>
I am rich makes me so.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  term 'art' is often and variously described as an appeal to aesthetics, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  reflection or mutation of nature, or a work of the imagination designed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  affect the sense of beauty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Challenging or appealing to one's sense of aesthetics is a far cry from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  simple entertainment. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but it takes education, refinement and a desire to learn those 
<BR>
standards; not everyone will take the time to do so. In our constantly 
<BR>
changing world view, we are drawn back time and time again to older, more 
<BR>
conservative art forms which do not really challenge us as much as they used 
<BR>
to. We really need to explore cultural output in context. I agree with you 
<BR>
that it is a good thing that not all art stems from financial need (or greed) 
<BR>
because experiments and risk are so integral to growth in creative fields. 
<BR>
Progressive art rarely has financial success at first, and large project 
<BR>
often fail. Take the example of rock bands who bring orchestras on tour with 
<BR>
them and go broke. Then they end up suing Napster  ;o)
<BR>
<P>I agree with both ends of the spectrum.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, I have to make my living as an artist, so I aspire to the 
<BR>
former, since no one has left me a trust fund, and I have no counts or 
<BR>
countesses or rich banker patrons to allow me luxury of creation for 
<BR>
creations sake. It gotta sell, so it gotta be pop. And I make crap too, along 
<BR>
wth the good art, just becasue I make lots of it, and someday maybe, like 
<BR>
Steven King, people will buy even my crappy art.
