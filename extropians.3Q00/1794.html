HEADLINE: Minneapolis braces for disturbances at animal scientists' conference
<BR>
<P>BYLINE: By JOSH L. DICKEY, Associated Press Writer
<BR>
<P>DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS
<BR>
<P>BODY:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police are preparing to control hundreds and possibly thousands of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrators as some 500 scientists from around the world meet here 
<BR>
starting
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday for the International Society of Animal Genetics conference.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers say the biennial event, being held in the United States for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;first time, has never been confronted by demonstrations. But protest 
<BR>
groups say
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they'll do &quot;whatever is necessary&quot; to end what they call the exploitation of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;animals and dangerous manipulation of genetic material.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police have purchased more than 100 sets of riot gear and will set up a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;perimeter around the downtown hotel hosting the six-day conference.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are preparing for any stage of what might happen,&quot; Chief Robert Olson
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least two summer festivals have canceled or postponed events for fear 
<BR>
of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;disruptions caused by protesters. The Minnesota Orchestra, after 
<BR>
consulting with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;police, canceled three Sommerfest concerts scheduled for Sunday, Monday and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The animal research group began in the mid-1950s as a coalition of 
<BR>
scientists
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;interested in comparing research on livestock blood-typing and 
<BR>
grouping. As the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;science of genetics evolved, so did the organization, which now 
<BR>
claims about 650
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;members. Most of those are university and government researchers, said Brian
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirkpatrick, ISAG secretary and animal-science professor at the University 
<BR>
of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisconsin-Madison, where the organization is based.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirkpatrick said ISAG is one of the world's most prominent groups 
<BR>
that shares
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;information on the gene mapping of livestock and companion animals, used to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;enhance their health and resistance to disease and harsh conditions, like 
<BR>
heat
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and cold. He said no experimentation or testing will take place at the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;organization's 27th conference.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's just a bunch of scientists getting together and reporting what 
<BR>
they're
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;working on,&quot; Kirkpatrick said. &quot;We've never really been a target for 
<BR>
protests
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;before.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Bullard, a spokesman for the University of Minnesota-based Student
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Organization for Animal Rights, said between 40 and 50 people from 
<BR>
SOAR and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper Midwest Resistance Against Genetic Engineering, also known as 
<BR>
GrainRAGE,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;met Tuesday night to discuss their demonstration strategies. Bullard said
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;GrainRAGE is the main organizing group.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullard said the group plans to gather in Loring Park near downtown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Minneapolis at 6 p.m. Friday to begin a march toward the Hyatt Regency Hotel
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;where the conference is being held.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police spokeswoman Cyndi Montgomery said the department has consulted with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;law enforcement agencies in Seattle and Boston to learn from their recent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences. Seattle was the site of violent and paralyzing demonstrations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;during the World Trade Organization meeting in December, while Boston spent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks preparing for a biotechnology conference in March that went relatively
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;smoothly.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Montgomery said Minneapolis police have spent about $100,000 preparing for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the six-day event, including the purchase of nightsticks, plastic hand 
<BR>
binders
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and &quot;hard dress,&quot; a type of riot gear made of rigid foam.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullard, of SOAR, said he doesn't see why demonstrators should be kept 
<BR>
from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the site, but wouldn't say whether they might try to cross the perimeter.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Montgomery said if they do, police have discretion to make any 
<BR>
arrests they deem
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's just say that we will deal with any activity as it occurs,&quot; 
<BR>
Montgomery
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;said. &quot;People have the right to freedom of speech. We support that. It's 
<BR>
just
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we can't tolerate unlawful behavior or civil disobedience.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons for opposition to animal genetic modification vary from group to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;group. SOAR, which most frequently protests animal experimentation and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vivisection on campus, takes issue with the cruelty to animals associated 
<BR>
with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;genetic engineering, Bullard said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's turning animals into machines for profit, even more so than they are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;already,&quot; Bullard said. Other groups are more concerned with safety and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;preserving the integrity of the gene pool.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of GrainRAGE, which was founded in January, did not return phone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;calls Tuesday or Wednesday. The organization's Web site says that ISAG is a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;good excuse to rail against one of the foundations of our death-culture.&quot; 
<BR>
It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;also posts a &quot;Stop the mad scientists!&quot; schedule, calling for a 
<BR>
&quot;shut 'em down&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;event Monday at an undisclosed location.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We hope this doesn't turn into another Seattle, we won't tolerate another
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seattle, and we're prepared to handle anything that happens here in 
<BR>
Minneapolis
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this weekend,&quot; Montgomery said.
