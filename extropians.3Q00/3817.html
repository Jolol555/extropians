<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Exactly, and that's what makes it such a potent symbol. There is IMO
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; no more appropriate symbol for the end of the human (biological) era
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; than the good old skull. It basically says: &quot;one way or the other,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; biology is finished&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This misses the point in a rather grand way.  As Eliezer pointed out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we have fear impulses in response to skulls; it triggers our &quot;run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;away&quot; response.  The notion of &quot;prevention of harm&quot; becomes foremost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in our minds.  It makes us think &quot;avoid this; avoid this URGENTLY.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>It's the Singularity, run for yer lives!! The skull is, above all, a great 
<BR>
attention grabber. Whether or not people will associate it with &quot;danger, 
<BR>
avoid this&quot; when it's *on a T-shirt* depends largely on the rest of your 
<BR>
lay-out (and on how the wearer looks, of course). IMO, anyway. And then 
<BR>
there's also the fact that plenty of people have a morbid fascination for 
<BR>
skulls and related stuff, so it would be something like &quot;Hey check it out, 
<BR>
a skull! Cool! Huhhuhuh!&quot; rather than &quot;avoid this; avoid this URGENTLY.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You don't want to communicate the notion that &quot;those who view this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;T-shirt should avoid the end of biology,&quot; if I understand you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;correctly.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's right. It *is* a call to action, though. &quot;Danger, get organized now 
<BR>
or DIE&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;You want to communicate the *inevitability* of the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;flesh.  But a skull necessarily registers an &quot;avoid this&quot; response on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the part of the viewer.  So that's not the one you want.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What may perhaps be a consoling thought to many of us, there IS no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;symbol for the inevitability of death in Western culture.  Death
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;itself, and dying, has many symbols: the skull, the grave, the coffin,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the funeral dress; they may suggest inevitability if one is in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thoughtful mood and you happen to think that death is inevitable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But, so far, there is no symbol which, itself, communicates that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;death will come to you.&quot;  If there were one, that is the symbol that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you'd want to put on your T-shirt.
</EM><BR>
<P>You could try something with the extinction theme; for example, have a 
<BR>
T-shirt with some well-known species of dinosaur and the text &quot;Hodie mihi, 
<BR>
cras tibi&quot;. Then below that, or on the other side: &quot;Singularity is coming, 
<BR>
no flesh shall be spared!&quot;, and/or Vinge's quote.
<BR>
<P>There is, on the cover of some SF book I once saw (something by Heinlein, 
<BR>
perhaps?) a picture of a robot who's about to throw an astronaut from a 
<BR>
mountain (he holds the struggling figure high above his head). Very 
<BR>
powerful, could be used for an anti-AI T-shirt.
<BR>
<P>Or, on a more positive note, just TECHNOLOGY WILL SET YOU FREE, and then 
<BR>
the URL of your choice. Simple, mildly enigmatic and (presumably) 
<BR>
effective. An alternative version could feature an uplifting transhuman 
<BR>
graphic, for example Natasha's _DNA breakout_.
