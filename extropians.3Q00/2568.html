Subject: Re: Steven King's other stuff/was the plant
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Reason: my wifes grandfather, her father and her brother all read every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;LAmour book, and loved them all, except they all hated Haunted Mesa.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In an effort to be a part of the family, I tried to read a LAmour book,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hated it.  Tried another, put it down, couldn't pick it back up.  Then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I reasoned, if they hated Haunted Mesa, perhaps I would like it.  Well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it was silly, but far less so than the westerns.  Actually it had its
</EM><BR>
moments,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;if one is in the mood for that sorta thing.  spike
</EM><BR>
<P><P>As have most people (I suppose)...i've gone thru some distinct &quot;phases&quot; in
<BR>
regard to reading....there for a while i got onto a Western kick and read
<BR>
every louis lamour book i could find......
<BR>
<P>But i got over it.
<BR>
<P>Actually another author...Dan Parkinson.....wrote some very good western
<BR>
novels.  I haven't been able to find anything new from him in years but the
<BR>
one's that i did read were historically accurate to my cursorial appraisal
<BR>
(written about the area of the country that i knew something
<BR>
about.....texas, oklahoma, kansas etc)...
<BR>
<P>What got me started on Dan Parkinson was a book called &quot;Calamity Trail&quot; (i
<BR>
beleive)...
<BR>
<P>It should come with a warning label.  It is NOT for the weak of heart.
<BR>
<P>You see....it's hilarious.......i read it...almost died lalughing...i lent
<BR>
it out to my mother in law...the next day my father in law complained to me
<BR>
that she had staid up all night reading it....and giggling uncontrolably....
<BR>
<P>So that got me started on Dan's more serious stuff...some of which was funny
<BR>
too.
