<P>&lt;&lt; Tipler et al. actually once proved some powerful theorems about open
<BR>
&nbsp;universes, showing that it was not possible to close them by
<BR>
&nbsp;rearranging the matter inside. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
In his Theory of Immortality, though, he does give an example of how very 
<BR>
tiny amounts of energy, over a very long time can rearrange matter in order 
<BR>
to close the universe in  two directions. That example was using a 
<BR>
butterfly's energy to move the earth from one side of it's orbit around the 
<BR>
sun to the other side-in about 500 million years!
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;Sure, but that is not good evidence for Tiplers position. If he had
<BR>
made a plausible sketch of such a system or showed some theorem that
<BR>
implied the existence of high-energy complex systems he would be on
<BR>
much steadier ground. Now he is just assuming that it must be
<BR>
possible, a bit like a space program assuming that before landing we
<BR>
will have come up with a way of landing softly...&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Well, what Tipler left out, Hans Moravec put in, with his Neutron Star 
<BR>
computers-or neutronium computations-however one wants to state this. One of 
<BR>
the great failures over the last 55 years has been the failure to produce a 
<BR>
successful, commercial, fusion power plant. My point is that at least with 
<BR>
tokamaks and stellerators, the greatest physical problem is plasma 
<BR>
&quot;turbulence&quot; or variation of the plasma stream; which tends to quench the 
<BR>
super-hot reactions needed to produce workable reactors. Call this a 
<BR>
serendipity of scientific discovery; but such turbulence or variations, can 
<BR>
be considered &quot;primordially&quot; to be usable as a kind of super-hot computer--in 
<BR>
the great,  great, distant future. Its utility today might be analogous to an 
<BR>
antimatter-powered pacemaker; doable, but why-ever-fore? 
<BR>
<P>As far as proposing a soft-landing fix after one has launched a space program 
<BR>
(very good point!) what comes to mind, for me, is that life on this planet 
<BR>
has been dying for perhaps 4.5 billions years and almost certainly even 
<BR>
longer in the universe. The program has started already, by randomness, or by 
<BR>
designer or by some fractal process, or something we haven' t yet 
<BR>
conceptualized yet.  We must fix death &quot;on the fly&quot; because that is how our 
<BR>
universe is built. Perhaps &quot;all the Kings horses and all the Kings men cannot 
<BR>
put Humpty back together again&quot; today; but in a few billion years of 
<BR>
technology..?  The Transhumanist answer is a unbreakable egg, the Extropian 
<BR>
answer is to upload the egg into a realm of unbreakable cyber-eggs. Well, I 
<BR>
am starting to get hungry so I will close now.
