<EM>&gt;From suck.com, July 17th 2000:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Based on a True Story
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In a world in which a comedian's testicular cancer can be quickly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;repurposed as an hour-long MTV documentary with more laughs and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better production values than a Metallica lawsuit, it sometimes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seems as if any story can get a big- or small-screen version, just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so long as the following magic words are sprinkled over the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treatment: Based on a True Story.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In fact, to judge from the mega box office for the recent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blockbuster Erin Brockovich, the story doesn't even have to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;particularly true just so long as the hero talks like a sailor and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looks good in tight clothes. (Alternatively, judging from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tsunami-esque b.o. of the even-more-recent blockbuster, The Perfect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Storm, if the protagonists are actual sailors, they can even get 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;away with wearing baggy clothes.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But some stories ripped from the headlines are virtually guaranteed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;never to inspire any Hollywood movies, even - and perhaps especially 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- if they're tales jam-packed with suspense, drama, and hints of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conspiracy at the highest levels of power. To do so would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Picture this one, for example: The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, &amp; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Firearms, hoping to do something more exciting than collaring kids 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;buying smokes and desperate to recover its good standing with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Congress after a sexual harassment scandal threatens its funding, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decides to stage a highly publicized raid of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Kennedy-family-style &quot;compound&quot; of a crazy rock-and-roll religious 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cult (no, not the Church of Rome). The charge: The freaks inside are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amassing an illegal weapons cache.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Although the agency knows that the cult has been tipped off about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the impending action - and although it knows it can arrest the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group's leader on his regular trips into a nearby town - the BATF 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;elects to enter the compound by force. There's a shoot-out, during 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which both agents and cult members are killed, and a stand-off 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ensues.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The FBI is called in and dutifully plays bad pop music loudly for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;weeks on end in an effort to force a surrender. The feds eventually 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decide that enough Abba and Olivia Newton John is enough and decide 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to again attack the compound. During this second raid, 75 true 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believers, including two dozen kids, perish in a fire whose origins 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;remain a matter of dispute. As the ashes cool over the carnage, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;president calls it a &quot;typical&quot; mass suicide, dismissing as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;coincidence the fact that the deaths corresponded closely both with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the stand-off and the government's decision to send armored vehicles 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crashing into the walls of the cult's compound.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Some years after the incident, a universally well-respected expert 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in &quot;thermal imaging&quot; - in reading film and videotapes for funny 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;business related to guns and fire - is hired by the U.S. Congress to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look over footage of what everyone now concedes was a massive 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government fuck-up. The question at the heart of this real-life 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;version of Blow Up: Whether federal agents, contrary to sworn 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;testimony, shot into the building during the final raid, effectively 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;trapping the believers in a hellish blaze. As he endlessly replays 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;videotapes that the government at one point insisted didn't even 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exist, the expert becomes more and more convinced that he has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stumbled onto a massive cover-up.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In various press stories, he suggests that the tapes he's examining 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;show that feds are lying and that the FBI squeezed some triggers in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the general direction of the compound: &quot;The gunfire...is there, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;without a doubt.&quot; In a letter to the lead counsel in a wrongful 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;death suit brought by the heirs of the dead freaks, he writes, &quot;I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;still have a lot of shocking evidence to show you.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Then, just as the expert is readying his final report to Congress, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he goes missing for several weeks, eventually turning up as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decomposing corpse in his own Maryland office. After a brief 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inquiry, the police determine that the 42-year-old expert had died 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of a massive heart attack. According to a Washington Post reporter 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who attended Ghigliotti's funeral, there were just nine mourners, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;until a &quot;knot of dark-suited men arrived...They sat off to the side, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by themselves, five of them. They exited hastily after the ceremony, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not pausing to greet [the expert's sister] or anyone else.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is the sad, strange story of Carlos Ghigliotti, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thermal-imaging analyst hired by Congress to pore over tapes of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;final moments of the 1993 seige of the Branch Davidian compound 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outside Waco, Texas. There is, to be sure, no reason to suspect foul 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;play in his death earlier this year. (Indeed, there is some reason 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to believe he was driven over the edge by his Waco work: &quot;He told 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his sister it was depressing him. He told me he didn't want to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;endlessly relive a tragedy that most Americans had long forgotten,&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wrote Post reporter Richard Leiby in a May 28 piece on Ghigliotti's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;death.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But there's also no reason to expect that a Hollywood which once 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used such haunting, suggestive episodes as source material for all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manner of political thrillers and meditations on power (think of The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Parallax View or Silkwood) will ever figuratively touch Ghigliotti's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rotted body with a 10-foot boom. As the warm embrace of Tom Green's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cancerous nut suggests, that's not because Hollywood isn't willing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to wrestle with unseemly flesh per se. It's because such reckless 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speculation about Washington villainy would contravene what has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emerged as one of Tinseltown's defining characteristics over the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;past decade: An abject willingness to treat Bill Clinton as if he's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a Renaissance king and to flatter him with sycophantic dramatic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;versions of himself. Forget about Bill Clinton's contributions to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;balancing the federal budget or his role in creating an America in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which people are free - at last ! - to talk incessantly about oral 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sex. In the end - and especially if he signs on with Dreamworks SKG 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after he leaves office - Clinton's ultimate legacy may come to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seen as the ushering in of a new age of court culture, in which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;movie stars and studio heads shamelessly flatter and favor their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rulers in return for a pat on the head and the chance to tan 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves, however briefly, in the reflected glow of power.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;These guys get into it for the buzz,&quot; a Hollywood star's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;political-issues&quot; adviser told The Nation's Marc Cooper last year. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Their interest isn't ideological,&quot; explained &quot;legendary 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;left-liberal rainmaker&quot; Stanley K. Sheinbaum. &quot;They just want to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;invited to Camp David. They want to sleep in the White House.&quot; Which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;helps explain the tales of Geffens, Spielbergs, and Hankses dropping 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on a regular basis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And, perhaps more interestingly, why a self-styled rebel type such 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as director David O. Russell gushes about the special White House 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;screening of his &quot;very large subversive film&quot; Three Kings last fall. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Clinton reportedly &quot;thought the movie brilliant,&quot; which is not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surprising given that it harshly critiques one of the supposed high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;points of his predecessor; no word yet on whether Russell is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;planning a Kosovo war pic anytime soon, perhaps to show to the next 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;president.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The rise of the new court culture is perhaps most visible in actual 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;depictions of the president. As Time noted a few years back, until 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Clinton became chief executive, &quot;the President of the U.S. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couldn't get arrested, at least not in the show-business sense of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the phrase....[W]e had seen relatively few presidential characters 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the big screen since the era of Dr. Strangelove and Seven Days in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;May back in the '60s.&quot; During the Reagan years, in fact, audiences 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;looking for executive drama had to content themselves with President 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;E.G. Marshall's unconditional surrender to General Zod in Superman 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;II.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's all changed over the past eight years of so.Forget about the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psycho Vietnam vet and the hooker with a heart of gold. Bill Clinton 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has midwifed an entertainment era in which the stock character is as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;likely as not to be the President of the United States. These 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;characters have ranged from well-intentioned, kind-hearted impostor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Dave) to sympathetic, romantic widower (The American President) to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reluctant, hardened-under-pressure hero (Independence Day) to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pompous, delusional incompetent (Mars Attacks! ) to Alan Alda 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Candian Bacon) to distracted, workaholic dad (First Kid) to horny, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;murderous hypocrite (Absolute Power) to horny to genial good ol' boy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Primary Colors) to hunky, ass-kicking defender of God, family, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;country (Air Force One) to Nobel-Prize winning, moral crusader (The 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;West Wing).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There is a general progression here, a dispiriting one that moves 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from dueling, hotly contested visions of the president as good or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evil to a more uniform conception that often shades into a flat-out 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;apologetics for power. This latter point is particularly true if one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reads films such as American Beauty for their implicit political 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;content: A middle-aged man beset with a job crisis, a frigid, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;career-obsessed wife, and impure feelings for a girl his daughter's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;age is made sympathetic when shot to death by a right-wing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crypto-Nazi. Nor is it confined only to dramatic forms: Bill Maher, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the relentlessly conformist m.c. of Politically Incorrect, recently 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hosted an L.A. fundraiser for Clinton. Only five years ago, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rubber-faced host got into hot water for saying &quot;fuck&quot; in front of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Clintons at a Radio and Television Correspondents Association 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dinner and doing blue humor at their expense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Regardless of Clinton's politics, such a progression is as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;regrettable as it is ironic (An uncritical advocate of mandatory 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;V-chip technology and tighter content restrictions, the prez has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been quick to wag his finger at the entertainment industry as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;locus of evil and to threaten executive action whenever it serves 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;him politically). Any development that leads to an impoverished 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;range of fictional possibilities is always to society's detriment. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As is anything that gives Martin Sheen a regular acting gig, thereby 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taking him away from the far more socially beneficial task of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;closely supervising his sons.
