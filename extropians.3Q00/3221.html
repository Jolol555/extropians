I am not sure I disagree with your comments on the state of affairs in the 
<BR>
Balkans over the last several decades. The we I refer to is the U.S. and 
<BR>
European citizens. I toyed with Libertarism back when the economy really 
<BR>
sucked back in the late 1970's, but I currently believe it to be unworkable, 
<BR>
in large part because I believe we lack the nanotechnology to implement it. 
<BR>
This seems to be the first economy driven by technology only. The Nano era is 
<BR>
not here yet.  I am not attempting to embue guilt or a sense of 
<BR>
responsibility upon you. But there have to be a sense of  international law 
<BR>
in this era. The technology to inflict heavy damage has grown. I believe you 
<BR>
cannot live under your own fig tree, so to speak, forever. People with vastly 
<BR>
different values might not chose to let you in peace.

<EM> &gt; &lt;&lt; The easiest way to remove a dictator: one bullet right through the

<BR>
<EM> &gt;  That doesn't take a massed army.  It doesn't take a concerted alliance
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;  against him or her.  Just one bullet from one gun.  Game over.

<EM> &gt;  I have to get back to making sure things happen, especially with a name

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Exactly!
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; As to who sat on their asses while massacres raged-basically we all did.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;We
<BR>
<EM> &gt; being USA, Canada,Nato,France.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;There's that plural again!  I must be missing something.  Are you a member
<BR>
&nbsp;of the government?  Where did you affect the decision-making process?  Did
<BR>
&nbsp;Tony Blair or Bill Clinton consult with you before they decided to give
<BR>
&nbsp;authorization to bomb?  Or perhaps you flew missions over Belgrade?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;As for me, I was a critic of the war, before, during, and after the war.
<BR>
&nbsp;(See below.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; As for Croatia, please to let everyone know
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that I am not of fan of Utashis (adolph's ally in the balkans),
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Okay.  Hey, everyone!  Look who's not a fan of the Ustasha!  Done.  Max
<BR>
&nbsp;Power gets things done.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; but I recall
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that the old Utashi dictator died recently, and was replaced by a much,
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;more,
<BR>
<EM> &gt; congenial government-as in non-massacre loving.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;True.  Franjo Tudjman's died recently.  I.e., he lived a long and bloody
<BR>
&nbsp;life.  His party only lost power a few months ago.  The Mesic-Racan
<BR>
&nbsp;government seems much better and likely to reform in the direction away from
<BR>
&nbsp;nationalist authoritarianism.  Of course, the deed is done, so some might
<BR>
&nbsp;argue that Tudjman's group completed their mission.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; For all their past
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; hideousness, the Croat-Utashi government did not draw first blood, or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; threaten that it would.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;That depends on when you start looking.  If you look in 1941, the Ustasha
<BR>
&nbsp;wins hands down.  If you look in the 1990s, surely, it's hard to say.  But
<BR>
&nbsp;even if they did not, killing innocents is wrong period, no matter who's
<BR>
&nbsp;doing it or when.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; That was the Chetniks under Milosovich, who started
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; off the camps and &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;. Once fighting began, anything can be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; possible.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;The process was a little different.  I think, basically, all sides wanted
<BR>
&nbsp;regions wherein their ethnic group was a sizeable majority and no threat
<BR>
&nbsp;existed to its power.  (The same process, sadly, seems to be taken place in
<BR>
&nbsp;Ethiopia and Eritria right now, though, of course, no one is suggesting NATO
<BR>
&nbsp;get involved.)  Or, more likely, the leaders used ethnicity to stay in or
<BR>
&nbsp;expand their power with this kind of logic.  My point was merely Croatia
<BR>
&nbsp;gets a free pass here (as does just about every other nation state that
<BR>
&nbsp;plays the ethnic cleansing game), by the U.S. State Department and by
<BR>
&nbsp;Michael Lorrey.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;In some cases, e.g., Indonesia, it would not even be a matter of going in
<BR>
&nbsp;and fighting against that government, but just of cutting of military aid.
<BR>
&nbsp;President Clinton had a chance to do that before the massacres in East
<BR>
&nbsp;Timor.  He did not and notably few people were vocal on this.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; As far as involvement in the process-I am just another ass-sitter who
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;lived
<BR>
<EM> &gt; their lives and essentially did nothing, just like everyone else.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;It's no one's responsibility to save the planet.  That said, if you feel the
<BR>
&nbsp;urge, do so, but leave those who just want to work on their small
<BR>
&nbsp;neighborhood alone.  Don't think you have the moral high ground because you
<BR>
&nbsp;want to save some strangers half a world away, regardless of whether it will
<BR>
&nbsp;work.  (Results are very important.  Here, we have lots of dead people and a
<BR>
&nbsp;region in shambles.  IMHO, the Kosovar Albanians were better before the war
<BR>
&nbsp;than now, especially the ones who are now dead.  Same for me.  I wouldn't
<BR>
&nbsp;want someone rescuing me by getting me killed.)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;And I thought this list was full of libertarians, not war loving hawks!:)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Later!
