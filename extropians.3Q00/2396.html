<P>
Several years ago I had an experience with 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic
<BR>
Acid--same chemical family as 2,4,5-T or &quot;Agent Orange&quot;) which is a
<BR>
broad-leaf herbicide extensively used on pasture land in my region. It's
<BR>
related to the plants' natural growth hormone and kills the plant by causing
<BR>
unregulated growth.
<BR>
<P>My neighbor needed to have his barn cleaned out, and I needed nutrients for
<BR>
my garden, so I got some good exercise shoveling manure. My neighbor didn't
<BR>
spray his pasture, so I felt certain the manure would be safe to use. After
<BR>
the addition of the manure, the garden soil was beautiful to behold.
<BR>
However, within a few days of transplanting into the garden, the plants in
<BR>
the nightshade family (including Irish potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, and
<BR>
eggplants) began to grow in that frightening, contorted manner which
<BR>
indicates 2,4-D poisoning--the nightshade or solanacea family is especially
<BR>
susceptible to 2,4-D, so these were the first to exhibit symptoms.
<BR>
<P>I immediately took some cuttings from the sick plants to my agricultural
<BR>
extension agent, who told me that he saw this sort of thing all too
<BR>
frequently.  The 2,4-D is concentrated in the animals' urine, so the dose
<BR>
conferred by the manure can be even higher than the original dose applied to
<BR>
the pasture. It turned out that my neighbor had bought some hay from a
<BR>
pasture that had been sprayed, and this was the source of the 2,4-D in his
<BR>
animals' manure. Sunlight breaks down the chemical within a few months, but
<BR>
in the absence of sunlight, it can persist for YEARS.
<BR>
<P>The chemical is so powerful that a few molecules escaping from a tank on a
<BR>
passing truck can damage cotton crops. My ag extension agent, educated at a
<BR>
university which praised chemicals such as 2,4-D has come to see them as
<BR>
dangerous.
<BR>
<P>I haven't seen any research addressing concentration of 2,4-D, bovine growth
<BR>
hormone, or other chemicals in cows' milk, but I've seen research done on
<BR>
the breast milk of Inuit women living in remote sub-Arctic regions which
<BR>
have revealed surprisingly high concentrations of toxic chemicals
<BR>
(transferred from the developed world via wind &amp; water) in their milk. I
<BR>
suspect that most commercial cows' milk contains fairly high doses of
<BR>
various synthetic hormones.
<BR>
<P>Seeing's how I want to live a long and healthy life, I avoid the
<BR>
contaminated milk problem by milking my own goats or purchasing cows' milk
<BR>
from a dairy which claims not to use BGH (I've personally inspected the
<BR>
dairy to satisfy myself as to the truth of their claim). It doesn't make
<BR>
sense to me to take other life extension measures without paying close
<BR>
attention to the food I eat.
