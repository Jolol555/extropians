<EM>&gt; Actually, readers of the book would see that he did not actually die of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starvation directly, but innoctuously poisoned himself with an alkaloid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a wild plant that was very similar to one he regularly lived on in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wild in the southern 48. The alkaloid prevented his system from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; digesting anything, so no matter how much he ate (and he shot a moose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and ate many wild plants, so he was not starving) it didn't get into his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This young guy, dont remember his name, did not come up to Alaska after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; graduating college, but after several years of living in the wilderness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the lower 48. While many did think he was politically naive and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emotionally immature, he was a skilled outdoorsman and knew how to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; himself alive.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The kid's name was Chris McCandless, as I recall. I found his story quite
<BR>
moving--he made some mistakes that appear stupid in retrospect, but I could
<BR>
picture myself making similar mistakes if I'd been in his situation. (I
<BR>
wouldn't have made mistakes about the plants, but then I've been studying
<BR>
wild &amp; cultivated plants since I was 10 years old).
<BR>
<P>I believe the root of the plant in question WAS edible, but the seeds were
<BR>
not. Chris had been eating the root of the plant all along; his metabolic
<BR>
problems started when the seeds ripened and he began to eat them. There are
<BR>
a number of common garden plants for which roots are edible but seeds and
<BR>
leaves are not--Irish potatoes and jicamas, for example.
