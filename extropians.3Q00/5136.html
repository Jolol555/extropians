From: Barbara Lamar &lt;<A HREF="mailto:shabrika@juno.com?Subject=Re:%20self-extracting%20zipware%20AI%20'casting&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110703b5ea9f72bca4@[213.23.5.46]&gt;">shabrika@juno.com</A>&gt;,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Psychological questions: Assuming that the the re-assembly instructions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;include preserving the memories of the original entity, what would it be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;like to regain consciousness within a body completely different from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;original one?
</EM><BR>
<P>This happens several times to the main character in Charles Sheffield's
<BR>
_Tomrrow and Tomorrow_. Nice story. He also has a 30 pg appendix describing
<BR>
(accurately! yahoo!) the physics behind the story.
<BR>
<P>I found the most intriguing part of the story to be when the main character
<BR>
sends out about a million copies of himself to perform a large task. After
<BR>
his copies succeeded, and each had a million experiences different from each
<BR>
other, the main character assimilated those million copies-with-new-experiences
<BR>
back into himself. The description of the process of reintegrating
<BR>
&quot;himselves&quot; was fascinating. The end result was truly a god-like creature.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If your goal is to exist in a distant place as some form of living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;consciousness not necessarily the same as your original form, there may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be some inspiration at the UT Austin website for the Center for Nonlinear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Dynamics at  <A HREF="http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu/">http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu/</A>  , in particular their pages on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Biologically Inspired Physics, neural networks, and  pattern formation (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;find the pattern formation stuff espeically interesting)--includes pics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from *Nature* article on self-replicating chemical spots.
</EM><BR>
<P>I didn't look at your utexas URL yet, but I'll guess that it's closely
<BR>
tied to Ilya Progogine's work. Prigogine works for 2 months out of every
<BR>
year at UT, and his group's interests are far more diverse than those in
<BR>
the Santa Fe Institute. Prigogine's work focuses on nonlinear
<BR>
dynamics but they study: ants, chemical reactions, economics,
<BR>
statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum dynamics, etc.
<BR>
<P>Prigogine discovered the chemical Belousov-Zhabotininskii reaction,
<BR>
which is the oxidation of citric acid by potassium bromate catalyzed by the
<BR>
ceric-cerous ion couple. It's a kind of chemical clock. He won a Nobel
<BR>
Prize some years ago for his work.  Progogine's book: _From Being to
<BR>
Becoming_ should give some background information of some of his
<BR>
group's research.
