<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If it's real, it is by definition part of reality.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then you are creating a set which only has value if there is such a thing as
<BR>
&quot;not&quot;real.  But by your own definition, no such things exist (i.e.: Reality
<BR>
= All things)  Again, this definition has no value because it is not a
<BR>
description that contains any information.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Obviously you can invent as many imaginary &quot;realities&quot; as you like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But if you have multiple realities, the question remains: By what term or
</EM><BR>
word
<BR>
<EM>&gt; will you refer to the sum of all realities? And is not the sum of all of
</EM><BR>
them a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; single set?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm suggesting a different way of looking at things entirely.  I accept the
<BR>
concept of reality as a working model, but I do not have absolute belief in
<BR>
an external reality.  Not yet anyway.  We do not currently have the ability
<BR>
to perceive reality directly.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm just running out the door, so I can't really address this right now,
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm certain you'll agree there is value in making the distinction
</EM><BR>
between
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reality and our perception of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No problem with that -- it doesn't contradict that fact of one reality.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, it does.  If we draw the distinction you agree to above, the only
<BR>
'fact' we have is in our perception of reality.  Your belief in the
<BR>
existence of one reality is an article of faith, not fact.  Under current
<BR>
operating conditions we are slaves to a sensory mode of existence.
<BR>
<P>Belief in reality makes perfect sense-- it fulfills our need for causal
<BR>
relationships.  This is a very human way of looking at the world.  We posit
<BR>
that in the action of throwing a ball, a real object has moved from point A
<BR>
to point B.  We may or may not be correct.  It may later be revealed, for
<BR>
instance, to have been a VR simulation (and you, the unwitting subject.)
<BR>
Again, belief in reality is obviously a good working model.  It is a
<BR>
convention of your mind that facilitates your existence.  I prefer however
<BR>
to leave that sliver of skeptism in my mind-- I trust my senses, but if the
<BR>
nature of things is shown to be fundamentally different, then I am prepared
<BR>
to be flexible.  Further, I am prepared to believe in no &quot;nature of things&quot;
<BR>
at all-- that we live in the emergent vapor of an existence that is
<BR>
illusory, for instance.
<BR>
<P>Heady stuff and apparently of very little practical use other than mental
<BR>
excercise.
<BR>
<P>I do hold however, that there are very practical ways in which we can
<BR>
leverage the plasticity of our perception of reality into control over that
<BR>
reality.  If I could sit you down in a room and have a conversation with you
<BR>
about it, I would, because a written explanation would be tiresome-- I'd
<BR>
have to spend too much time convincing you I was talking about something
<BR>
rational.  Indeed, extremely rational.
