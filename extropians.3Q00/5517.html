<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;For those who are still living pie in the sky over the 'great' system of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;socialized medicine in Cuba, I direct you to an AP article by Pauline
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Jelinek
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;today about their testimony before congress yesterday about the state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;medicine and things in general in Cuba, and their own attempt to defect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Cuban medical mission in Zimbabwe, how the Canadian Embassy turned them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;away.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;They detail how the 'luxurious' hospitals that foreigners see and use when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;visit Cuba are reserved only for them and Communist Party officials (where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we heard this before?), and the common Cuban has difficulty even getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;anti-biotics and pain killers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't have a link, as I saw it in the Boston Globe today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Most students of the situation in Cuba who are also interested in general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; health issues agree on why health is generally good in Cuba: Meat is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easy to find for the average person there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is that all meat or just red meat? I'd have to argue against that, unless the
<BR>
cuban government does not allow fishing. Cuba has some of the best seafood
<BR>
fisheries around. I would say that cubans probably get far more exercise from
<BR>
walking and biking than the average American, which I would guess is the main
<BR>
contributor, while there have also been many reported instances of malnutrition
<BR>
related diseases including blindness there. Also, considering that mortality
<BR>
rates contradict the vegan mantra when a meat  diet primarily depends on free
<BR>
range animals, and that Cuban life expectancy is far lower than American
<BR>
(although whether this is due to health or just so many people being shot by
<BR>
the government, I can't tell), I'd have to say that your 'students of the
<BR>
situation' are out to lunch.
