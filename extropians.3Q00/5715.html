<EM>&gt;The point is, do you favor or oppose someone else's good luck, if it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is a net benefit to the group as a whole.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;That isn't quite the point. It is a net benefit only if the value of
<BR>
the increased resources exceeds the harm associated with the increased
<BR>
inequality.
<BR>
&nbsp;There are good reasons to think that changes in a person's relative
<BR>
wealth have much bigger effects on how that person feels than changes
<BR>
in absolute wealth do (see Robert Frank's book Luxury Fever). This
<BR>
means that it not hard to imagine that something which increases both
<BR>
inequality and the total resources available can cause a net harm. And
<BR>
because people have incentives to understate the extent to which they
<BR>
value relative rather than absolute wealth (admitting that you want
<BR>
to keep others from getting rich is rather antisocial), it is easy to
<BR>
misjudge this.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;As the size of the benefit gets up into the trillions of dollars, the
<BR>
effects start to resemble making one person a world dictator. It is
<BR>
this kind of consideration that would probably cause me to oppose a
<BR>
&quot;benefit&quot; of this sort that exceeded something like $100 billion.
<BR>
&nbsp;I will be reluctant to believe people who are claiming they would
<BR>
support giving someone $100 trillion until they explain why they
<BR>
aren't deterred by the maxim &quot;power corrupts&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I think this exercise does a good job of illuminating some of the
<BR>
motives for opposing superhumanism, although a lot of motivation is
<BR>
probably a plain old desire for job security.
