<EM>&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.com?Subject=Re:%20dating%20services%20(was%20Thought%20love-%20(was)%20Madison%20Ave.Love%20(was)%20True%20love%20may%20be%20)&In-Reply-To=&lt;NDBBKBECILABFJHGFBDGGEENFKAA.altamira@ecpi.com&gt;">owner-extropians@extropy.com</A>

<EM>&gt;  I've always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanted to try to run a dating service but never felt able to do it.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I almost DID start one last year.  I was trying to think of interesting ways
<BR>
to make money without having to commute into town more than once a week or
<BR>
so, and I'd seen statistics indicating that the most heavily visited sites
<BR>
on the internet were sex sites and singles sites. And of course I recalled
<BR>
my Dream Maker experience and the tremendous response we got from the men.
<BR>
<P>Most of the singles sites I looked at on the Web gave you the feeling of
<BR>
entering a very sleazy meat-market bar, but I found one service that looked
<BR>
pretty good.  I called up the guy who was running it, and we worked out an
<BR>
agreement where I would run the service in Texas (where I live) and keep
<BR>
some very generous portion of the gross receipts (I forget what exact % we
<BR>
agreed on).  But when they faxed the written agreement, they wanted to put a
<BR>
time limit on the deal, which would have meant they'd step in and take over
<BR>
after I'd put in all the work of building up the business.
<BR>
<P>I liked the way they were doing things, though, and I've thought of starting
<BR>
up something similar on my own or with a local partner or partners. One of
<BR>
the things that was different about this service was that they had monthly
<BR>
meetings where members could get together for dinner, maybe go to a cultural
<BR>
event after dinner.  I think this is the sort of thing you'd want to do to
<BR>
appeal to women. They also had a couple of pages about how to *act* on a
<BR>
first date, what to talk about, that sort of thing.  These pages were pretty
<BR>
silly, but such a thing might be useful if done with some creativity.
