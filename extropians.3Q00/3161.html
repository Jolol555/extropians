<P>
Please. Not from 1947. If the japanese had that kind of technology in 1947 we
<BR>
either wouldhave known about it at that point, or would have lost the war to
<BR>
them. Alien encounters, so far as we can currently tell, are merely the product
<BR>
of hypnogogic trances induced by chemical or electrical imbalances, as
<BR>
Persinger's research with electric fields shows. If the level of alien
<BR>
abductions are as high as proponents claim, there would be a fleet of at least
<BR>
1000 such ufo's at a base on earth over the last 40 years, and at least one
<BR>
crash every year. Such a fleet would require a resident population of a minimum
<BR>
of 100,000 aliens to support with C3I, maintenance, and logistics support, and
<BR>
this is also assuming that they don't have the same need for resources that we
<BR>
do, that they do, in fact, have some sort of nanosanta technology. If they don't
<BR>
have this then their logistical problems on increase from there.
<BR>
<P>Most of the alien BS you see is merely disinformation to cover for military R&amp;D,
<BR>
while some 'abduction' phenomena with material evidence may be evidence of
<BR>
either government or corporate illegal experimentation on humans (since we know
<BR>
the Energy Department has admitted to conducting such research for many years,
<BR>
this is not out of the bounds of possiblity, not nearly as far as alien
<BR>
abduction).

<EM>&gt; The Controversial Colonel Corso in his book, &quot;The Day After Roswell&quot; has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one complete chapter on the prospect that the allegedly captured aliens
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from Roswell were robots of a sort. I have to see that as something worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considering but with a different spin. If the &quot;products of measured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence&quot; can all be matched or exceeded by robots today using the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; state-of-the-art technology (as I conclude in the Epilogue of &quot;Machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Psychology&quot;) then military intelligence cannot afford to ignore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this. Black Projects must be dealing with this in some way right now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the prospect then exists of a robotic military intelligence centre
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; having robots working tirelessly 24 hours a day on advancing military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science and those robots are more intelligent than competing human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military scientists, as defined above. No military worth its salt can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; afford to ignore the possibility of an enemy having such an installation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Theoretically, Japan for example could race centuries past the US with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hidden installation no bigger than a box car. And those &quot;aliens&quot; could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then be advanced robots from centres such as this.
