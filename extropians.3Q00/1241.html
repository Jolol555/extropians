The problem with Canadian psychic debunker Amazing Randi, is that he's never 
<BR>
met a phenomena he ever liked. With Uri Geller he could reproduce some of the 
<BR>
results like spoon bending, though not in quite the same fashion. I believe 
<BR>
that when Amazing (I believe it would be ok if I called him by his first 
<BR>
name) is debunking psychic crapolla he is doing us a favor. When he passes 
<BR>
judgment on people's philosophies; he moves from skeptic to cynic. In my 
<BR>
opinion cynicism is a philosophy unto itself, and one that I try to resist 
<BR>
mightily.

<P>&lt;&lt; [I must say  - don't beat me, please! - that about 20 years ago I tried 
<BR>
&nbsp;to stop my japanese watch, mechanical, auto-loading, 
<BR>
&nbsp;by means of thought, or mind. 
<BR>
&nbsp;The watch immediately stopped for 5 seconds. 
<BR>
&nbsp;The pointer was in a strange small vibrational state.
<BR>
&nbsp;I was terrified. I never repeated that *experiment*. 
<BR>
&nbsp;So that experiment was *not* a scientific experiment. 
<BR>
&nbsp;After that: I still do not like the *paranormal*.... 
<BR>
&nbsp;and the amazing James Randi!]
