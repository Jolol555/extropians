<EM>&gt; &gt; Godhood implies perfection, and requires all these absolute abilities;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; immortality, omnipotence, omniscience, are good examples.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But, does it imply perfection at some exact moment or in process?  If we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't assume that the end of this universe (if those models are as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct as we think) is the absolute end of any and all sentiences that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; came into being in this universe, then it is not so certain that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot be immortal for instance.  That we can be killed now and perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for several thousand more years does not imply we will inevitably die.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>It's also possible that you begin making coin tosses, and have that coin
<BR>
come up heads every time, and that this would continue until the heat death
<BR>
of the universe or continue, transcending the universe into subspace or
<BR>
hyperland or fairyworld or whatever. But still, at any point, the future
<BR>
still unknown beyond some limit, you could still turn up a tail in the
<BR>
future. Still, you could die. So you are not immortal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The &quot;omnis&quot;.  Suppose those Omega point folks are right for a moment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That Sentience will be as omniscient as it is possible to be.  Beyond
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that isan impossibility.  Is an omni defined by definition to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impossible of acheiving a fair standard of anything at all?  If it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utterly impossible than apply the idea to &quot;God&quot; or &quot;gods&quot; makes all such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trivially impossible.  But that is a rather pointless game.  To a human,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially a primitive one, the smallest of the Powers would satisfy the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; omni criteria.  Omni-present?  Well, if this eventual Sentience ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manages to transcend space-time then conceivably (depending on how you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take things like Many Worlds notions) this being can in fact be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; omni-present, Alpha and Omega, and so on.
</EM><BR>
<P>If omni-x is defined pragmatically, then sure, I guess you can reach it in
<BR>
principle. But then, you also allow exceding omni-x, which doesn't make
<BR>
sense - &quot;Ha ha, mere omnipotent being, feel the wrath of my hyper-omnipotent
<BR>
power!&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Otherwise, omni-x is defined in the pure sense. This could be imagined, at a
<BR>
stretch, for omniscience; lots of &quot;gods&quot; could be omniscient at once
<BR>
(although perhaps Heisenberg would have something to say about this). You
<BR>
can't say this about omnipotence, however, unless you have only one &quot;being&quot;
<BR>
(taken in the loosest sense). Otherwise there is room for conflict, which
<BR>
isn't allowable under the influence of omnipotence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As a matter of fact, a Singularity class sentience or several of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; combining is about the only way I can imagine that something like most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think of as &quot;God&quot; could exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hopefully they wont think of themselves in that way.
