<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;All this talk of &quot;humbots&quot;; horrible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yeah, I thought it was an ugly term, myself, just couldn't come up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything off the cuff that was less ambiguous.  BTW, I didn't find
</EM><BR>
anything
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to disagree with in what you say, so I almost didn't respond. But, then, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought, should I only reinforce disagreements?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Good effort! That's probably a first for this list. Thanks!
<BR>
<P>I think a lot of people post good things here, and are discouraged by being
<BR>
ignored. I've come to the conclusion that it usually means people agree with
<BR>
you. I think I'll try to actually tell people ths more often.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I'd lean toward the name &quot;teleoperative&gt;  Not a bad idea, altho I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sure that it isn't already in use for other things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I wonder if those things that teleoperative is being used for, might in fact
<BR>
fit the definitions I've already given? If not, I'm sure I can broaden them
<BR>
to the point where they cover whatever is most likely to make me look like I
<BR>
invented the idea.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;To even achieve decent mid-range control factors, we are going to need
</EM><BR>
good
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;wireless comms; bandwidth! In Australia, I know I can only get 9600bps
</EM><BR>
over
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;a mobile-phone link; I'm not sure what other technologies are available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;here. 9600bps is not enough. I think some newer, better data options are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;coming online soon; I'm going to keep an eye on that. What's the
</EM><BR>
situation
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;in the US? What sort of data rates are available? What's on the way? I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we really need realtime video to make this plausible; probably a way off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Although there are possibilities even without it; you've got relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;decent, affordable audio if you can get to 56K, so the teleoperative has
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be your eyes. Still, there's a dedicated person on-site, working on your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;behalf; better than a conference call.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I'm interested in the state of wireless comms in the US, mainly. What's
</EM><BR>
an
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;affordable data rate (say using cellular networks), and what are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;charges
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;like? How about if money was no object; what kind of bandwidth could we
</EM><BR>
put
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;between a teleoperator on one side of the world, and a teleoperative on
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;other?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the mid-80's, Vivid had Mandala running between the continents, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; French executives batting a virtual birds who flew over into the New York
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; execs screen - but they were using dedicated cable.  However, the X-10
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people have a little RF battery-operated Video plus Audio camera available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for $69, with a limited range, to-be-sure (about 100').  A couple such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cameras - and there are many manufacturers of such with better range,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resolution, etc. - would give you the main data feed from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;teleoperative.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The signals could then feed into a pair of computers - X10 already
</EM><BR>
supplies
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the interface/software - and be sent out hi-end DSL.  Using off-the-shelf
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hi-bandwidth local RF going to a landline/satellite instead of current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cellphone tech, the bandwidth is virtually unlimited for our purposes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Trying to do it using just WAP would be fairly unsatisfactory at present,
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; suspect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a good alternative. It would require some serious infrastructure
<BR>
costs, and is likely limited in the areas is can cover. Those costs might be
<BR>
too high, unless you can tap into an existing RF network. The electricity
<BR>
utility that I used to work for had its own networks for data and radio;
<BR>
infrastructure companies like that would be a good choice. In my experience,
<BR>
their internal comms network infrastructure is often overblown, and has
<BR>
spare capacity.
<BR>
<P>For cellular, I don't think I'd be looking at WAP. More likely, you'd want
<BR>
teleoperatives to have a full wearcomp rig, and to be using real equipment,
<BR>
not WAP toys.
<BR>
<P>I got the impression somewhere (can't remember where, d'oh) that some of the
<BR>
cities in the US have untimed wireless data call service providers; you pay
<BR>
to connect, but don't pay per unit of time. Either that, or else there is
<BR>
seriously cheap wireless. Here, if I stayed online for an hour using my
<BR>
mobile+laptop, I'd end up paying at least A$30. If I were to use higher
<BR>
bandwidth commercial solutions, I'd expect to pay a LOT more than that; it
<BR>
starts to be an incredible limiting factor on teleoperation.
<BR>
<P>Still, if I were the kind of person who tended to fly on the concorde a lot,
<BR>
just now I might consider a teleoperative to be a really good alternative,
<BR>
even at a price like, say, US$40/hr for the operative, US$40/hr for the
<BR>
comms, US$40/hr for good luck, so maybe US$120/hr. You could probably
<BR>
provide a half-way decent service at that kind of rate.
