On Track: Precise Method Of Locating Intercontinental-Range Ballistic 
<BR>
Missiles And Other Space Targets 
<BR>
<P>Using signals from GPS satellites, an ONR-funded researcher has developed a 
<BR>
much more precise method of locating intercontinental-range ballistic 
<BR>
missiles and other exo-atmospheric (space) targets. Electromagnetic signals 
<BR>
from space are bent by the atmosphere much the same way light is bent when it 
<BR>
passes through water. Existing tracking methods use climatological data to 
<BR>
deduce the amount of bending the signal should incur due to air moisture and 
<BR>
temperature. 
<BR>
Because these deductions are not always entirely accurate, the target's 
<BR>
actual location and its presumed location can be off by several miles. A 
<BR>
researcher at University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) in 
<BR>
Boulder, Colo., has devised a way to make this tracking more accurate. 
<BR>
<P>Using a radio instrument to first track GPS satellites, whose exact positions 
<BR>
are known, the amount of bending the signal is enduring in a certain 
<BR>
atmospheric region can be determined. A target's signal in the same 
<BR>
atmospheric region should be experiencing the same degree of bending due to 
<BR>
similar atmospheric conditions, and thus an accurate position for the target 
<BR>
is discovered. This technology has applications in high-precision tracking 
<BR>
radars. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The preliminary results are very successful,&quot; said ONR Program Manager Scott 
<BR>
Sandgathe, &quot;but it will need to be tested in more environments and seasons&quot; 
<BR>
before it finds its way into the Fleet. The next planned experiment will take 
<BR>
place in southern California during September to coincide with the strong 
<BR>
Santa Anna winds.
