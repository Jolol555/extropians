&quot;Zero Powers&quot; writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps because at one time or another most of us were recalcitrant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; children.  Yet none of us feels that it would be a good thing if we had been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh? Really? I can remember more than a few conversations with childhood chums in
<BR>
which we had decided it would definitely have been a very good thing if we had
<BR>
been killed (or aborted) as little kids.
<BR>
(You see, we were quite depressed and upset at those times, and wished that we
<BR>
could have our existence ended.)
<BR>
<P>The reason we don't kill kids is because we're biologically wired to make
<BR>
infanticide a taboo.
<BR>
(Except for Chinese Communists, who everyone knows eat their young.)
