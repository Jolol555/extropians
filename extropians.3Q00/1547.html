<P>
I feel exactly the opposite from those women you spoke to.. In my mind,
<BR>
given that (in America) the rule of law is strongly on the woman's side (in
<BR>
the case of child support/divorce/pregnancy/etc), I can't trust a woman to
<BR>
be truthful when she says she is on &quot;the pill.&quot;
<BR>
If I can remove the need to trust her with the headsman's axe, as it were,
<BR>
then I'm all for it.
<BR>

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Edinburgh University scientists say the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clinical trials of a male contraceptive pill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suggest it is 100% effective, with no harmful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consequences. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I recall the last semester of my undergraduate career
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taking a required course in endocrinology (circa
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1978).  Near the end of the course the professor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; briefly mentioned some (then) current research on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Male Pill&quot;.  The chemical name of the compound being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investigated was 5-Thio-D-Glucose, if memory serves.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The prelims looked real good.  It was a non-steroid,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there were no side effects observed in monkeys, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; full fertility was regained in a matter of days after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quitting with no observed withdrawal effects.  Hell,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was basically a sugar pill with some sulfur on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number 5 spot on the Glucose ring.  I forget how it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; worked, though. Considering how much more complex and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensitive the female system is compared to males, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was fascinated and called the man doing the research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (some University in Illinois).  He informed me that he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saw great potential but his grant had not been renewed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and he hoped that someone else would pick up the ball
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and run with it. I almost went into graduate school to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become an endocrinologist so that I could run with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that ball.  But after discussing the idea of a male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pill with lots of different women, I discovered that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the (then) prevalent attitude was that it didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter if there was a male pill because men could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really be trusted to take it.  I heard things like,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Well, if I was living with the guy and I actually saw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him take it then I guess it would be OK, but if I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just dating some guy, I'm not going to take the chance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of getting pregnant on his say-so that he took the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pill.  I'd have to take my own precautions to be on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the safe side anyway.&quot;  The article says only 2%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't trust their partner to take the new pill.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have to assume that there was ultimately something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong with this compound or someone would have done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more with it.  Or maybe it would have been so easy to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacture that there wouldn't have been any profit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in it.  I don't know.  Concerns expressed at that time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were mostly about psychological effects on the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; libido. Oh no!!!  Not a reduced libido!!!  Impotence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anxiety is probably why the grant wasn't renewed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;From the above article:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Over 32 years have passed since [the Pope]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; predicted if this, what he called contraceptive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; morality, took hold there will be a whole number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of unfortunate consequences - like people having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a more relaxed attitude to abortion and marriage,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; increased divorce and a larger number of unplanned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pregnancies.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One concern that a friend of mine expressed is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those men least likely to take the male pill are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ignorant, the stupid, and the lazy while those most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to take the pill are on the other end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spectrum.  Not particularly good news for the gene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pool.  This friend of mine also suggested that men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will now have even more of a propinquity to engage in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaningless sexual encounters and women's psyches will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continue to harbor resentment toward themselves, men,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and society in general because of this behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sometimes it seems like this notion that recreational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sex is a bad thing is primarily propagated by those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; women who continue to perceive the need for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long-term commitment from a man before they can feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comfortable in a relationship and this appears to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carryover from the days when women depended heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upon men's resources for their well-being and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well-being of their children. My hope is that the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pill will indeed take us a step closer toward a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relaxed attitude toward our sexuality, but not a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; relaxed attitude toward the responsibilities of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marriage and/or family. We really need to get past the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paradigm where women sort men by the size of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wallets and men sort women by their potential for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sexual gratification. I have to admit though, these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hopes are probably unrealistic on my part.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What are some of the other Male Pill issues being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debated?
</EM><BR>
