<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Good thing that a bunch of smart people on this planet decided to try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;exert some influence over our reality despite its apparent inevitability.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Instead of shrugging and saying: &quot;Hey, we can't stop Frank from chopping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;down Roger's plum tree and setting his barn on fire, so let's not
</EM><BR>
bother,&quot;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they figured they'd whip up some aribitrary social contracts to control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;undesirable individual behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; OK, you're obviously a smart guy.  Let's hear *your* idea for a workable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;social contract&quot; that's going to keep people from pirating music and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software.  Sure you can shut down Napster.  But can you shut down IRC? or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gnutella? or Freenet?  I'll tell you what, in the unlikely event that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *can* come up with a workable solution, I know some folks over at the RIAA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who would be happy to make you very rich in exchange for your bright
</EM><BR>
ideas.
<BR>
<P>The Internet is akin to the wild frontieer.  Current laws have very little
<BR>
teeth in the online world-- something that's leading to increasing concern
<BR>
over issues such as invasion of privacy and online stalking.
<BR>
<P>If Internet time was  a little bit slower, I expect that you would see a
<BR>
natural evolution of structure-- more mom's and kids moving out to the wild
<BR>
west, more need for stability, more law makers,  etc.
<BR>
<P>As it stands however, the cowboys are running the salon, and they've got the
<BR>
biggest guns.
<BR>
<P>As I've indicated before, my preferred solution is a technological one.  But
<BR>
I -am- in favor of social engineering to get us where we want to go.  So,
<BR>
what do we do?
<BR>
<P>Firstly, if we decide that something is against the law, we should be
<BR>
prepared to enforce that law.  People are taking a lot of things for granted
<BR>
right now and they aren't going to be exactly happy to give up their free
<BR>
toys.  Nonetheless, the government can't wuss out.  This requires an
<BR>
educated, involved, technological government body-- and I think its pretty
<BR>
clear to most people that we don't exactly have that just yet.  Some simple,
<BR>
educated commitment to protecting individual rights online would send a very
<BR>
strong signal.  People need to recognize that a significant portion of our
<BR>
existence is making a move into a virtual realm and we need to be prepared
<BR>
to bring significant structure to our new modality.
<BR>
<P>Of course the cowboys don't want to play nice-- they have all the power in
<BR>
the current model.  Unfortunately it seems hard to illuminate those
<BR>
individuals to the larger perspective-- if we bring stability to this world,
<BR>
a real civilization can start to form.
<BR>
<P>Alright, I don't have any pat answers, but I can suggest directions that we
<BR>
should be moving towards:
<BR>
<P>a) Increased Education.  We've been pirating stuff for so long, we've
<BR>
forgotten its against the law.  Remind people that some of us make a living
<BR>
with our brains.  Remind people that IP is valuable... and getting more so.
<BR>
<P>b) Involved Government.  The law makers need to get online and get wired.
<BR>
This is the new world and it's no longer good enough to just have good
<BR>
people skills and an understanding of bridge tolls and urban violence.
<BR>
<P>c) Legitimate Access.  I absolutely agree that the RIAA should have bought
<BR>
Napster-- what were they thinking?  A widely available means to legimately
<BR>
access content is desperately needed-- and as a directly commercial venture
<BR>
it should be able to offer better, more reliable, more legitimate service
<BR>
than anyone else.
<BR>
<P>d) No wimps in Law Enforcement.  The laws need teeth, and if you're going to
<BR>
call it illegal, then do something about it.
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>e) Technology.  To my mind, it's clear that there are huge benefits for
<BR>
people to be more closely integrated with their information.  Those benefits
<BR>
need to be demonstrated and distributed.   New technologies should focus on
<BR>
personal power-- less about how thousand of college kids can get free music,
<BR>
more about how you as an individual can make your own music.  Technologies
<BR>
that make it easy and profitable for people to be contributory, not easy and
<BR>
profitable to leech.  Superior encryption should be widely available.
<BR>
Individuals should be able to participate in totally private, secure
<BR>
communication and transactions.  We need smart information: data that knows
<BR>
stuff about itself, data that follows rules.
