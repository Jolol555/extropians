<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But most likely I’d
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; probably feel that these far lesser intelligences were not worthy of my 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and attention and, worse, I’d feel that they were trying to exploit me 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; asking me to devote my time and energy to their “puny, little problems” 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I could be out instead exploring the fascinating great beyond.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Looks to me like you just answered your own question.  That is how *you* 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;feel.  Why?  Because you are an evolved human, with all manner of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sophisticated, evolved hardware which establishes observer-biased goals and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;observer-biased beliefs and all manner of social perceptions for detecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cheating and avoiding exploitation... as was an advantage in your ancestral
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You can't reason from your own intuitions about goals to the actions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;superintelligence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If, as seems to be the default scenario, all supergoals are ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;arbitrary, then the superintelligence should do what we ask it to, for lack 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything better to do.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure that I cannot, from my evolved biological milieu, accurately 
<BR>
predict how the AI would feel.  But I assume: (1) it will be curious (2) its 
<BR>
intelligence and knowledge will grow exponentially and (3) once it reaches 
<BR>
human level intelligence, it will *far* exceed human levels in very short 
<BR>
order.  Given those assumptions, you really think it will do what we say for 
<BR>
lack of something better to do?  I don't see it.
<BR>
<P>Seems to me any super-intelligence would have to have virtually zero 
<BR>
curiosity to sit around granting human wishes and obeying human orders for 
<BR>
lack of having any other interests worth pursuing.  And, it seems like a 
<BR>
super-intelligence without curiosity would be impossible to engineer.  
<BR>
Unless it has some internal motivation to seek out knowledge on its own, all 
<BR>
its knowledge would have to be force-fed.  Meaning that it could never know 
<BR>
more than those who are feeding it, no?
