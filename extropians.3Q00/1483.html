</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have trouble responding to you, Dana, and I'll do my best to point out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would argue that my usage of environment as an 'entity' is strongly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suggestive of Gaea Theory. While not a complete one to one mapping, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thought that perhaps I could winnow down our discussion to a belief that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; could possibly account for an appropriate use of the word spiritual by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sort of jumping ahead to see if you subscribed to any of that belief.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you wondered whether I like the Gaea Theory, it would have been more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficient to ask directly rather than trying to winnow.  And how about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of &quot;suggesting&quot; things you just come right out and say them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Fair enough. You've given me your answer on this, so I'll retire this
<BR>
topic.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; So, you are certain that some kind of communication took place?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What are you looking for here?  To move the discussion into the realm of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; epistemolgy?  To discuss the meaning of certainty? To talk about different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forms of communication?  Are you &quot;suggesting&quot; that humans and non-humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never communicate with each other?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
What am I looking for? Well, there are many levels that I can answer
<BR>
this question. I'm guessing that you are looking for something a little
<BR>
bit more concrete or rather, &quot;efficient&quot; as you say, beyond letting the
<BR>
conversation pace itself. I agree, while the former may be more
<BR>
pleasant, it is definitely time consuming and may take significant
<BR>
effort to make relevant to list topics. In this vein, let me be blunt:
<BR>
<P>You claim some kind of communication with an animal. Whether you call it
<BR>
spiritual or something else, you have offered that this connection was
<BR>
real and that something meaningful was transferred between the two of
<BR>
you. My questions: What kind of &quot;communication&quot; do you think took place?
<BR>
Do you think this possible with other animal forms? Do you think the
<BR>
specific situation gave rise to this communicatory feeling, or do you
<BR>
think this is something more general?
<BR>
<P>I believe that there exists some form of empathy within which shared
<BR>
meaning can be had between two very different animals. This is most
<BR>
easily demonstrated between domesticated canines and their owners. But,
<BR>
it is quite possible that this connection could exist with other, wild,
<BR>
animals. Another question for both of us: Is this connection possible
<BR>
with other life forms? Plants and trees are a good example here. Many
<BR>
believe that their plants understand and respond to their
<BR>
communications. Do you believe this is true? Why, or why not?
<BR>
Personally, I think that plants are too far removed from similarity with
<BR>
us that our beliefs about our &quot;connection&quot; with them are erroneous. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I don't understand if you're actually interested in what I have to say, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you want to have an argument.  I already agreed with you that &quot;spiritual&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was not a good choice of words.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Wow. I am interested in what you have to say. I post rarely in this
<BR>
forum, so when I do it is because I have interest. I thought that our
<BR>
discussion had moved beyond the use of the word spiritual, with the
<BR>
exception of my last attempt at giving a possible reason for the use of
<BR>
the word spiritual within a Gaea context. (For which I apologize for not
<BR>
communicating more plainly.) Clearly, though, I misunderstood the nature
<BR>
of our discussion. But hopefully, this latest post is worth starting a
<BR>
new discussion on forms of communication with psychologies very
<BR>
different from ours. Is it even possible/meaningful? What do you think
<BR>
are the factors involved? How would you go about replicating the
<BR>
feelings of connection with the coyote? Etc.
<BR>
<P>If I wanted to have an argument, I would write more like M. Lorrey or L.
<BR>
Crocker. =) Bygones. Seriously though, when I talk/write with someone, I
<BR>
don't view it as adversarial. I view it more as an attempt by all
<BR>
parties to discover something new, together. More of a cooperative
<BR>
push/pull towards some undiscovered country of the mind (and all it
<BR>
entails), rather than a here's my opinion, bow down. If you'd rather
<BR>
have an &quot;argument&quot; I'll oblige, but I'd rather not if it's all the same
<BR>
to you. =)
