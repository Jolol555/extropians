<P><EM>&gt; The decision was certainly unjust and stupid, but I remind you it was not made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by a corporation, it was made by a judge appointed by a politician who got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the job because of his white teeth, pleasant smile, and really nice haircut.
</EM><BR>
<P>So the question to you John, is what is your alternative?  Without the judge and the
<BR>
legal system and the Constitution, how would Eric Corley and the MPAA work out their
<BR>
differences?  And in such a system, is there such a thing as free-speech? Or is it
<BR>
because the MPAA has more money than Eric Corley they decide what can be said and
<BR>
what can't?  After all it was you who said that the *feature* of free-markets is that
<BR>
such freedoms are open to the highest bidder.  Does this mean that that the rich
<BR>
corporations who have the most money to purchase such commodities as free-speech,
<BR>
mean that the rest of us loose that right?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From where I'm sitting, you've painted yourself into a corner.  If you can get out of
</EM><BR>
this one, my hats will be off to you, as you will have successfully answered all of
<BR>
my reservations about free-markets.
<BR>
<P>I eagerly await your answers, or anyone else who thinks they are up to it.
