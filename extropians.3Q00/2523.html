I've been asked to make this as well known as possible.    Please forward
<BR>
it to whoever may be interested

<P>----------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>We have had a request from a contact in the BBC to canvas readers for
<BR>
opinions on &quot;Ghostwatch&quot; for DVD. This was a one off show from a few years
<BR>
ago that was broadcast on Halloween and scared the nation witless. Staring
<BR>
Michael Parkinson, Sarah Greene, Mike Smith and Craig Charles the play was a
<BR>
pseudo documentary about a &quot;ghostwatch&quot; at a suburban house in Middlesex
<BR>
which cut between studio shots of Parkinson and &quot;live shots&quot; from the house.
<BR>
Although it was well signalled as a drama in the press before hand, many
<BR>
where taken in by it and believed that it was real, right down to the shock
<BR>
ending. Stories then circulated in the press for weeks after that the
<BR>
program was responsible for the &quot;Suicides&quot; of several teenagers after
<BR>
watching the show. In many wasy this was the BBC's equivalent of the
<BR>
infamous Orson Welles &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast.
<BR>
<P>One of the things that makes this so ripe for a DVD release is that most of
<BR>
the original material still exists on tape and many of the production team
<BR>
still lecture to media students on the show. Extra material should be easy
<BR>
to come by making it a great DVD. Besides, to the best of my knowledge it
<BR>
has never been re-broadcast and has never been available on VHS before.
<BR>
<P>If you would like to see this released on DVD then send a message to:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="mailto:bbcghostwatch@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[fort]%20Ghostwatch%20DVD&In-Reply-To=&lt;398AD277.37F0E293@frontiernet.net&gt;">bbcghostwatch@hotmail.com</A>
<BR>
<P>as soon as possible. I know I'd like to see this done with an excellent set
<BR>
of extras.
