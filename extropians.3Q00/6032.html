<EM>&gt; themselves of theism, and who continue to warp the minds of children with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; provincial schooling.. Face it, if people (at least nine tenths of them) are so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stupid that they cannot get past theism, why should they survive a technological

<P>Uh, excuse me, but that attitude is just as bad as that of any
<BR>
eschatologically minded fundie.  I like your general belief structure
<BR>
(rationality and such) better than theirs but both of you seem to take
<BR>
some glee in the prospect of the other's suffering, weeping and gnashing
<BR>
of teeth, death and dismembering to the point of extinction, or hellfire
<BR>
and damnation as the case may be.  I would also point out that not all
<BR>
people with beliefs different than your own or even my own can be
<BR>
evaluated as simply stupid.  
<BR>
<P>Those &quot;fundies and fanatics&quot; think a lot like you.  They would as soon
<BR>
see the world go up in a nuclear fireball as see machine worshipping
<BR>
blashphemers such as yourself (their view, not mine) sell all
<BR>
God-fearin' people down the river.
