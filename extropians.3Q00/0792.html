</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  LOL, good idea!!!!
</EM><BR>
<P>What's a good idea?
<BR>
<P><P>Tristate, I know sometimes I also am guilty of doing this, many of us have 
<BR>
heavy hands when hitting &quot;send&quot;.  But please try to be a little more cohesive 
<BR>
and practice restraint in your responses. This list has a high noise rate and 
<BR>
many are complaining about it already. I feel a little hypocritical even 
<BR>
bothering the list with it, in lieu of my own sometimes &quot;quippish&quot; nature. 
<BR>
There are many of us guilty of bandwidth abuse, me not less than others. But 
<BR>
it has been called to my attention when I do it, so here goes. 
<BR>
<P>Tri: Today you've posted about ten posts on this same topic (apparently all 
<BR>
with a few minutes of each other), with no reference points for me to follow 
<BR>
- most them only a sentence or two long, are you referring to another post,- 
<BR>
mine, someone else's? ... If so ... which one?  I am totally lost.
<BR>
Following context is hard in ANY e-mail and even harder on a list, where 
<BR>
traffic is so heavy already and the threads so many.
<BR>
<P>One thing, if you pasted part of the post you are referring to, I would know 
<BR>
what you mean by these comments. This way they seem disjointed. To what are 
<BR>
you replying?
<BR>
Two: sometimes I will write too many quick responses to one thread, but I'll 
<BR>
put it them a &quot;mail waiting to be sent&quot; file, so I can see if ANY of it holds 
<BR>
up later, after I read the thread a bit more. Then I rewrite it, condense it, 
<BR>
or even delete it, if it's not of general interest to at least SOME of the 
<BR>
folks here, and having something to do with the topic of futurism, 
<BR>
technology, art or imagination in some way...
<BR>
<P>Today with your posts, I open one after another baffled because and have no 
<BR>
reference points ... wondering if you knew this effect...  
<BR>
<P>Meaning you no harm, and hoping you do not take offense, 
<BR>
Nadia

<P><EM>&gt; If I had the &quot;problem&quot;, I'd start by just telling  myself that good looks

<EM>&gt; are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a dime a dozen and my significant other (or future significant other will) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  looks far better to me than anyone else could.   I think it can just be a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  matter of attitude.  The people who are not turned on by porn and in fact 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  find it disgusting are at a great advantage from the get-go, however.

<P><EM>&gt; These answers seem pretty simple to me on this topic.  LOL  To find out if

<EM>&gt;  people are into someone just for money they have to be able to be very

<EM>&gt; honest 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with themselves and ask themselves if they would still feel the same about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the person if the person had a different life and didn't have the money.

<P><EM>&gt; Here I go again!  LOL  I don't know that cybersex is a step away from sex

<EM>&gt;  I've been in chatrooms that were not mundane but I had to find some that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  not inhabited by many younger people and not titled something generic.  
</EM><BR>
The 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  best ones had serious, interesting room names.  On AOL I would try 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; categories 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  News, Sports and Finance, Special Interests and Arts.  The chatrooms on 
</EM><BR>
the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  rest of the internet seem to be mainly too broad based and those tend to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  boring topics going.  Newsgroups and message boards tend to be more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  interesting and meaty than chatrooms.  Hope this helps someone.  I'm 
</EM><BR>
pretty 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  much all over AOL and the internet.  :)
