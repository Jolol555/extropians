Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Werner's syndrome is caused by one single gene. This alone rules out the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;possibility that all age-related pathologies cannot have an upstream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;regulator. In addition, it also provides strong evidence that other simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;(probably not with just one gene but a few more) mechanisms can be upstream
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of most, if not all, aging pathologies. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Trouble with this suggestion (which I hope is correct!) is that we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know of any individual humans--the species best able to take care of itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;via foresight, etc--who have escaped fatality with lucky mutations. Or are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they in hiding (as in Poul Anderson's novel THE BOAT OF A MILLION YEARS)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or haven't there been enough humans around at any one time until lately for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them to emerge and then survive in the midst of plagues, wars, starvation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;etc? Are the mutational immortals all under 10 years of age, most of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in China and India?
</EM><BR>
<P>Good question. Well, obviously senescence is caused by more than one gene;
<BR>
which means non-senescent mutants would be very unlikely to appear
<BR>
overnight. Even so, as to why we never witness non-senescing mammals can
<BR>
have a couple of explanations: (1) perhaps Williams was right and
<BR>
antagonistic pleiotropy is behind aging: this means that the genes causing
<BR>
senescence are essential at earlier development or they are essential, for
<BR>
example, for certain advanced brain functions (one old proposal is that
<BR>
animals such as birds and mammals have senescence due to being warm-blooded,
<BR>
making them more intelligent but also leading to larger amounts of damage);
<BR>
(2) my favorite explanation is that the mutations needed to dispose of
<BR>
senescence are probably (at least to some extent) gain-of-function mutations
<BR>
(as opposed to Werner's syndrome). Here's a practical example: DNA damage
<BR>
causes senescence (Robert will love me saying this, but it's just an
<BR>
example, I'm not endorssing the DNA damage theory!) and Werner's syndrome is
<BR>
caused by defects in DNA repair. To eradicate senescence you need to make
<BR>
DNA repair enzimes more efficient (up to the level of non-aging species).
<BR>
Obviously such developments by random mutations are extremely rare (perhaps
<BR>
you need to create a whole new enzime, one that was lost when mammals
<BR>
evolved from reptilians); however, human DNA repair enzimes are a little bit
<BR>
more efficient than chimpazees, giving us our increased longevity (I'm being
<BR>
over-simplistic here, the differences between us and chimpazees might be
<BR>
related to an improved resistence to age-related pathologies and not a
<BR>
decreased rate of senescence; but you can think of mice vs. humans and
<BR>
follow the same reasoning). Interestly, and continuing my speculatory
<BR>
example, using transgenics by inserting DNA repair enzimes of reptilians in
<BR>
humans you can easily, and without having to radically change the genome,
<BR>
achieve this.
<BR>
<P>Best wishes.
