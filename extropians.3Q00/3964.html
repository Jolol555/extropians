<P><EM>&gt;&quot; There's the conundrum of how one is supposed to , as they say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;stay young&quot; Well I don't believe it has anything to do with young
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- because I know a lot of young people who have absolutely no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enthusiasm for life whatsoever - and deal with it very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;passively..... I believe it has to more to do with staying in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;touch with the society in which you live and not loosing  sight of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those things that keep you excited&quot;  - David Bowie
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This from a man who is looking veery good at age +/- 54 years, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wealthy, married to a supernmodel, has his own Internet ISP site
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(BowieNet), involved with fine arts, stage productions, has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;released three albums in the last few years and the list goes on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and on ... despite the fact that he smokes, gallons of coffee and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doesn't enjoy exercise! I wonder if this longevity has anything to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do with the fact that he was known as the &quot;Thin White Duke at one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stage. Could this be the result of unintentional calorie
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;restriction - despite the periods err experitments with mind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expanding substances ;-)

<P>Keith Richards in an interview said that Bowie was the hardest
<BR>
partyer he'd ever met. He went on to recount how they had been
<BR>
partying for a couple of days before Richards hit the sack, he said
<BR>
when he awoke a day later Bowie was still going..... Supposedly
<BR>
Bowie is a longtime speed/cocaine user.
<BR>
<P>I should say that Bowie has always been one of my favorite artists,
<BR>
a few years back he got them to do a bond issue based on a
<BR>
collection of his earlier and future works, it sold out no problem.
<BR>
<P>He continues to innovate....
