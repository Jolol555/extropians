<EM>&gt; behavior!!!!!!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What's next, throwing knives or lead slugs at other students?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ralph, didnt students fight when you were in high school?
<BR>
Wow, have things changed so much in 20 years?  Did not
<BR>
the young criminal element more or less constantly present
<BR>
unstated threats (and often very clearly stated threats) against
<BR>
the law-abiding majority?  You must have grown up in a nice
<BR>
neighborhood, Ralph.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; God has all civil behavior died in our society?
</EM><BR>
<P>I dont know.  When did all this civil behavior come to life?
<BR>
I never saw much that resembled civil behavior until I went
<BR>
to college.
<BR>
<P>To make it clear, I am not defending uncivil behavior or arguing
<BR>
that it should be tolerated, just that it has been in the past, and
<BR>
that things appear to be changing, so long as the victim is gay.
<BR>
In 5th grade, I was once paddled for being mugged.  In high school
<BR>
our class valedictorian was expelled for two weeks for being the
<BR>
victim of a totally unprovoked attack (both long stories).  spike
