<EM>&gt; How prophetic that just a week or two ago I watched a Stossel show on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;What Has Happened To Free Speech In America&quot;. IMO he has pointed to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of &quot;administrative fascism&quot; under the guise of a democratic system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that is why they must stop him. This whole code of &quot;Totem and Taboo in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; America&quot; has gone too far and is destroying lives and careers. Isn't it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time for Congress to conduct an investigation, starting with Stossel's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; program on the kind of tyranny against free speech which is being fostered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; especially by petty despots in academia? Let's start by examining those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free speech codes on campuses. And let's not stop with the letter of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; codes. Are they being SELECTIVELY enforced to the benefit of some and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; detriment of others to add to the injustice which they perpetrate?

<P>Your characterization of the movement against Stossel as &quot;administrative
<BR>
fascism&quot; seems to me entirely appropriate and accurate. I don't expect Congress
<BR>
to investigate this destructive and irresponsible trend anytime soon, because
<BR>
Congress itself operates under identical enforcement of conformity.
<BR>
As for whether they &quot;are being SELECTIVELY enforced to the benefit of some and
<BR>
the detriment of others to add to the injustice which they perpetrate,&quot; I'd
<BR>
answer &quot;Yes, definitely.&quot;
<BR>
<P>--J. R.
<BR>
<P>&quot;That at long last convinced me that there is no hope for me to bring about
<BR>
major reform in Governmental corruption by writing letters. Everyone in charge
<BR>
is too busy and too preoccupied to pay attention to the extraordinary, on which
<BR>
they lack public support to act anyway.
<BR>
&quot;Since the US government introduced Big Money into the Basic Science, more than
<BR>
half of a century has gone by. A new millennium is right around the corner. Do
<BR>
the government leaders in charge look on Basic Science with confidence and
<BR>
enthusiasm as their predecessors once did? How does big industry--- mostly the
<BR>
product of successful basic science in the past--- see the role of basic science
<BR>
in the industry of tomorrow? The answer, given below, is chilling to say the
<BR>
least. It seems that both the industry and the government have lost the vision
<BR>
for the future. &quot;  --Gilbert Ling
