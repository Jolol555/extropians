<EM>&gt; What if the first upload is a cryonics patient, who is legally &quot;dead&quot;?

<EM>&gt; What about the apparent majority today who can't accept a machine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being &quot;conscious&quot;?  What if the first upload company keeps their uploads
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from talking with and interacting with ordinary people in &quot;human&quot; ways?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Software just does useful things; you can't see how.)  And what if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can make *trillions* of dollars selling such software service?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Won't that motivate them to do what ever paperwork/lobbying it takes?
</EM><BR>
<P>Paperwork and lobbying won't necessarily do the job if people are morally
<BR>
opposed to the project.  Look at the genetically modified food issue
<BR>
we have been discussing.  There is a lot of money to be made but the
<BR>
companies may not be able to overcome public opposition.
<BR>
<P>Or look at illegal drugs - billions of dollars there, but no significant
<BR>
lobbying effort for legalization, because they know it would be useless.
<BR>
<P>Using cryonic suspendees as the guinea pigs for uploading experiments
<BR>
would be the height of immorality.  They can in no sense be considered to
<BR>
have given informed consent.  I couldn't see it happening in a political
<BR>
climate like today's.  Even for the illegal labs, suspendees would not
<BR>
make good subjects for the uploaders, as their brains are likely to be
<BR>
in worse conditions than fresh brains, and the personalities involved
<BR>
are not only unknown but probably quirky at best.
<BR>
<P>Keeping the existence of the upload secret seems highly problematic.
<BR>
If you're using the upload to do intelligent work, that probably is going
<BR>
to require a certain amount of natural language I/O.  You'd have to screen
<BR>
his outputs to make sure he's not saying, &quot;Help!  I'm stuck in this box!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Especially in order to make trillions of dollars, this software is
<BR>
going to have to be widely replicated, and used for a wide variety
<BR>
of functions.  I don't see how you can perform the necessary filtering
<BR>
to prevent him from communicating.
<BR>
<P>Plus, what are the odds that the destructive upload is going to work,
<BR>
first time?  Most things don't.  A number of people are going to be
<BR>
killed before you get an upload that works.  The moral opposition to
<BR>
such an effort would be overwhelming, especially when it comes from
<BR>
people who will be put out of work if it succeeds.
<BR>
<P>For these reasons, I don't think a public upload project would happen
<BR>
due to political opposition (at least not until the world has changed a
<BR>
great deal), and I don't think a secret, illegal, private project would
<BR>
be able to recoup its costs, either.
