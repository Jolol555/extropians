From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20SPACE/TECH/BOOKS:%20Zubrin%20falls%20on%20his%20pen&In-Reply-To=&lt;003101bffa46$b9edfe20$1b000100@newstrom&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt; wrote,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I presume that one of Zubrins frustrations with the 'nano-santa' premise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that it breeds an atmosphere of complacency, where anything hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do now in space will be put off until the nanites can do it for us. Such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an attitude can derail and end manned exploration once and for all, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starters. What this attitude will lead to in the future as well is for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it to devolve from acceptance of using robot probes, to merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; acceptance of remote observation by telescope, as people get more fat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and happy on their couches.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with this totally, Mike!  I am often frustrated with the attitude
<BR>
that we don't have to work for the future, that it will just happen.  I also
<BR>
disagree with the idea that energy and work will be free in the future, and
<BR>
that we will have nanites doing all work for us.  This argument has been
<BR>
made for industrialization, electricity, atomic power, computers, etc.
<BR>
<P>All nanites will do is turn everybody into nanite designers who work all
<BR>
week producing nanobot designs.  We will have to assimilate whole planets
<BR>
per day, or we lose our X-mas bonus.  We will have to amass whole
<BR>
solar-systems full of computonium just to be able to run the latest
<BR>
entertainment software.  We will not be compatible with everyone else on the
<BR>
Universal Net, unless we upgrade our systems every 3.5 solar days.  We
<BR>
probably will work all our lives to get enough money to retire to that
<BR>
self-budding baby-universe to escape the Heat Death of this rat-race
<BR>
universe.
<BR>
<P>We already are &quot;free&quot; from work.  I can live by 1800's standards off a
<BR>
garden on my land (since I'm a veggie).  I don't need to travel far, and can
<BR>
walk around town.  But I want a car, a satellite dish, Internet access,
<BR>
travel capability around the U.S., telephones,  a laptop, etc.  As our
<BR>
&quot;freedom&quot; grows, so does our wants.  We just set our sights a little higher,
<BR>
and spend all our resources toward the next level.
