<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Edinburgh University scientists say the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clinical trials of a male contraceptive pill 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggest it is 100% effective, with no harmful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I recall the last semester of my undergraduate career
<BR>
taking a required course in endocrinology (circa
<BR>
1978).  Near the end of the course the professor
<BR>
briefly mentioned some (then) current research on the
<BR>
&quot;Male Pill&quot;.  The chemical name of the compound being
<BR>
investigated was 5-Thio-D-Glucose, if memory serves. 
<BR>
The prelims looked real good.  It was a non-steroid,
<BR>
there were no side effects observed in monkeys, and
<BR>
full fertility was regained in a matter of days after
<BR>
quitting with no observed withdrawal effects.  Hell,
<BR>
it was basically a sugar pill with some sulfur on the
<BR>
number 5 spot on the Glucose ring.  I forget how it
<BR>
worked, though. Considering how much more complex and
<BR>
sensitive the female system is compared to males, I
<BR>
was fascinated and called the man doing the research
<BR>
(some University in Illinois).  He informed me that he
<BR>
saw great potential but his grant had not been renewed
<BR>
and he hoped that someone else would pick up the ball
<BR>
and run with it. I almost went into graduate school to
<BR>
become an endocrinologist so that I could run with
<BR>
that ball.  But after discussing the idea of a male
<BR>
pill with lots of different women, I discovered that
<BR>
the (then) prevalent attitude was that it didn't
<BR>
matter if there was a male pill because men could not
<BR>
really be trusted to take it.  I heard things like,
<BR>
&quot;Well, if I was living with the guy and I actually saw
<BR>
him take it then I guess it would be OK, but if I'm
<BR>
just dating some guy, I'm not going to take the chance
<BR>
of getting pregnant on his say-so that he took the
<BR>
pill.  I'd have to take my own precautions to be on
<BR>
the safe side anyway.&quot;  The article says only 2%
<BR>
wouldn't trust their partner to take the new pill.
<BR>
<P>I have to assume that there was ultimately something
<BR>
wrong with this compound or someone would have done
<BR>
more with it.  Or maybe it would have been so easy to
<BR>
manufacture that there wouldn't have been any profit
<BR>
in it.  I don't know.  Concerns expressed at that time
<BR>
were mostly about psychological effects on the male
<BR>
libido. Oh no!!!  Not a reduced libido!!!  Impotence
<BR>
anxiety is probably why the grant wasn't renewed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the above article:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Over 32 years have passed since [the Pope] 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; predicted if this, what he called contraceptive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morality, took hold there will be a whole number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of unfortunate consequences - like people having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a more relaxed attitude to abortion and marriage,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increased divorce and a larger number of unplanned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pregnancies.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>One concern that a friend of mine expressed is that
<BR>
those men least likely to take the male pill are the
<BR>
ignorant, the stupid, and the lazy while those most
<BR>
likely to take the pill are on the other end of the
<BR>
spectrum.  Not particularly good news for the gene
<BR>
pool.  This friend of mine also suggested that men
<BR>
will now have even more of a propinquity to engage in
<BR>
meaningless sexual encounters and women's psyches will
<BR>
continue to harbor resentment toward themselves, men,
<BR>
and society in general because of this behavior.
<BR>
<P>Sometimes it seems like this notion that recreational
<BR>
sex is a bad thing is primarily propagated by those
<BR>
women who continue to perceive the need for a
<BR>
long-term commitment from a man before they can feel
<BR>
comfortable in a relationship and this appears to be a
<BR>
carryover from the days when women depended heavily
<BR>
upon men's resources for their well-being and the
<BR>
well-being of their children. My hope is that the male
<BR>
pill will indeed take us a step closer toward a more
<BR>
relaxed attitude toward our sexuality, but not a more
<BR>
relaxed attitude toward the responsibilities of
<BR>
marriage and/or family. We really need to get past the
<BR>
paradigm where women sort men by the size of their
<BR>
wallets and men sort women by their potential for
<BR>
sexual gratification. I have to admit though, these
<BR>
hopes are probably unrealistic on my part.
<BR>
<P>What are some of the other Male Pill issues being
<BR>
debated?
<BR>
