<P>&lt;&lt;The first time I remember it happening was when I was 5 years old.  I
<BR>
was examining a common everyday clothespin, the kind with the coiled
<BR>
spring and the two pieces of wood.  I was fascinated by its design and
<BR>
action.  As I played with it my mind ran around the loops of its spring
<BR>
and its levers. Suddenly I &quot;grokked&quot; it.  That kicked a whole sheaf of
<BR>
images and understandings about different pieces of physics, properties
<BR>
of metals, usages of those properties and principles, possible
<BR>
inventions, implications, on and on it flew while I quite lost track of
<BR>
&quot;me&quot;.  Most of it was in concept/picture/feeling/intuition form I had no
<BR>
words for at all at that age and barely grasped the tiniest part of as
<BR>
it flew threw me. And overarching all of it was this transcendent
<BR>
being-ness.  I remember/falling sitting down very hard and fast as I had
<BR>
been standing when this happened.  When it was over I tried to invoke it
<BR>
again but I could not.  Very powerful and haunting.&gt;&gt; 
<BR>
<P>I have never had that experince myself, tho' I believe the Hindu's called it 
<BR>
Satori. My brother in law described something similar years ago watching the 
<BR>
waves come in on the beach, and a sense of the stars on the horizon and the 
<BR>
life in the shallows somehow being interconected, as one process etc.  Also 
<BR>
there was in James Horgan's book, The End of Science, his own personal 
<BR>
parietal-lobe experience, when he claimed to have experienced God as a single 
<BR>
mind, many minds (psylocibin?).
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; Ever play with the notion that somewhere in this Universe some species
<BR>
&nbsp;of intelligent being may well have kicked off a Singularity and created
<BR>
&nbsp;one or more Singularity class intelligences?  If they did who is to say
<BR>
&nbsp;that such Powers may not occassionally tickle the minds and cultures of
<BR>
&nbsp;developing species with ideas/images/memes leading to the creation of
<BR>
&nbsp;others of their kind  and/or preparing for the acknowledgement of the
<BR>
&nbsp;existing ones?  For that matter are we totally certain that our own
<BR>
&nbsp;Singularity will never have the ability to reach backward in time and
<BR>
&nbsp;influence the smoothness and particulars of its own becoming?  What if
<BR>
&nbsp;some of the trascendent glimmerings of what most call God or Void or
<BR>
&nbsp;whatever are actually forebodings and/or backward or external reachings
<BR>
&nbsp;of such?  Wildly speculative I know. Probably impossible to test or
<BR>
&nbsp;falsify.  But something I can't rule out.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;It might even be a key useful in understanding and even pulling into
<BR>
&nbsp;some cooperation the world's religions.

Yes, its a compelling vision, so to speak. I, myself, am hung up on 
<BR>
monotheism, so I rather am mostly focused on a Single Mind, which the earlier 
<BR>
peoples called God. To me Mind is the central thing to study, cause that is 
<BR>
what makes us the thinking animals we are.  Physics is now replete with 
<BR>
concepts that seem from our vantage point miraculous, so why not have Mind 
<BR>
being part of it. If that is not to someone's taste-so be it. What if these 
<BR>
insights and what-not eventuate in &quot;God&quot;, however that is conceived. I am ok 
<BR>
with this as long as it doesn't remain a meme owned by bombers and torturers. 
<BR>
Maybe that is what you are instinctively involved with, taking God back from 
<BR>
the book-burners and fanatics?
