You know?.....I've never thought of it like that.
<BR>
<P>My name is unusual too....it's intermediat...not overtly &quot;first or
<BR>
last&quot;...that is it could be two last names...or back-assward
<BR>
first/last....it's caused me no end of trouble....(Everitt Mickey).   In
<BR>
fact once during high school I beleive there was a paperwork mix up and
<BR>
during roll call in home room the teacher called out &quot;Everitt&quot;....(and I
<BR>
answered &quot;here&quot;) and a bit later called out &quot;Mickey&quot; ........(and I answered
<BR>
&quot;here&quot;)....this went on for some time....she was rather annoyed upon
<BR>
discovering the truth.
<BR>
<P>I've always considere it a disadvantage though.  I appreciate the new
<BR>
outlook.

Subject: Re: Reintroduction
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I changed my surname when I got married, to my wife's name (quick primer
</EM><BR>
for
<BR>
<EM>&gt;newer arrivals; I'm a man).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Changing your name is a good experience. The funniest thing you note is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people reacting to you differently. I changed my surname from Evans to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;O'Regan, and suddenly people (who hadn't known me before) were pointing out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all the Irish characteristics I possessed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However, I would never change my name to something easier to spell, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pronounce, or to anything more common. One of the best assets you can have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these days, in the massively crammed namespace of the net, is a weird name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've noticed it with my first name since I was a knee high to a
</EM><BR>
grasshopper.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;People remember me when I'm in a list of names; it means I get slightly
</EM><BR>
more
<BR>
<EM>&gt;personal treatment for no good reason. Job interviews are a particular case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in point; I introduce myself as Emlyn, and people say &quot;ah yes, I remember
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your application&quot;, because they notice the name. Another thing I like is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that people immediately assume I am going to be a bit eccentric, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lucky.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If someone has to ask you to spell your name, or makes the gaff of
</EM><BR>
mistaking
<BR>
<EM>&gt;you for the opposite gender, you've got it made. They will not forget you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've got a good friend, with a weird name; I've known him since our parents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lived in a group house together when I was 1 and he was just newly popped.
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;lost him in the last year; we both move around a lot and don't talk that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;often, different cities, so none of the contact details I had for him were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;correct. I couldn't even find him in a phone book, because he's always in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;group houses; never has the phone in his name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I jumped onto ICQ the other day and looked him up. Only one person existed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the world with that name; it was him. He told me he had lost my details
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;too; we might never have found each other again if not for that name.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My wife &amp; I chose the name Lachlan for our new son (three months old now).
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt;didn't realise it was such a popular name! Luckily, I found the spelling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Lochlainn (which we have used instead), it's irish, matches the surname,
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt;will cause him hell with spelling it out to people forever. But, it'll
</EM><BR>
stand
<BR>
<EM>&gt;out. As soon as someone thinks &quot;how do I pronounce this&quot;, they've thought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about you, and will remember you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A good test of appropriate name weirdness: If you can find a name you've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chosen on any off-the-shelf &quot;personalised&quot; merchandise (you know, mugs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;badges, those dumb plaques for your bedroom door), then the name is no
</EM><BR>
good;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;try again.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can't say much about the outrunning of embarrassing posts; I'm still busy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;posting them. I wouldn't worry; people understand you change, and it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;demonstrates that you learn. Fewer people do learn than one might think;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's a good thing to be able to prove!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Much of life is about standing out from a crowd. Any edge you can get is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bonus. This is not a good time to be called &quot;John&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Emlyn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(apologies in advance to the &quot;John&quot;s)

<EM>&gt;I've been thinking of switching recently - either to my middle name, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to something completely new, like &quot;Ben Abard&quot;.  (Short, easy to spell,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and close to the beginning of the alphabet.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Partially this is because my current name is so hard to pronounce.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the other reason is a harsh necessity for all children of the digital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;age...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...outrunning the posts you made when you were fourteen.
