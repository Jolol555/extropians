<EM>&gt; &gt; I know a lot of mystically inclined people, and the overwhelming majority
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know-nothing zipperheads, and happy to stay that way. They find thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; rationally, logically, to be too tiring for their poor little minds. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prefer, as a famous wrestler has said, 'the crutch of religion.' Religion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; mysticism ARE the opiates of society, just as much as opiates are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; religion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; While studying mystical things can be interesting, and good study for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; interested in stretching their mind, actually beleiving any of that nonsense
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the realm of simpletons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Spoken like a man who knows all without experiencing anything first hand.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's good to know that rational inquiry can extend to the things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Extropian dogma says are forbidden. ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Now, that is a personal attack.
<BR>
<P>There is a time for rational inquiry, and a time to come to conclusions about
<BR>
that which has been inquired into. Most all mysticism passed the second stage
<BR>
long ago.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  In other words, you are parroting the dogma fed to you without verifying it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for yourself, aren't you? I assume that you haven't actually put in the actual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *work* (and it is work) to learn to meditate, for example, in a more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simplistic fashion and found out if it is nonsense or not. Correct me if I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrong.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I've learned hypnosis, and done quite a bit of meditation, neither of
<BR>
which are in and of themselves 'mysticism'. I've studied yoga, buddhism, lots of
<BR>
different mythologies and new age kludges, along with various alternative
<BR>
medical theories. While it is interesting stuff, it is also mostly bunk.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  I know a hell of a lot more mystically inclined people than most of you, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wager. While many are vapid (just as many people into transhumanism are vapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; escapists as well), plenty are not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh boy, now its a pissing contest. Frankly, most of the people I know in
<BR>
transhumanism are most definitely NOT vapid escapists, extropians in particular.
<BR>
If Exi were more into vapid escapism I'm sure they'd have a far larger
<BR>
following, even just in California.
