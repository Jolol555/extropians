<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I've said, Krugman and most economists can be faulted for not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; specific technologies in more detail.  But most futurists can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; faulted for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; not understanding much economics.  The later sin seems much greater to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However, he fails to apply his agriculture argument to production of houses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;cars, and meat. When the price of a built house, car, or meat drops to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;commodity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;levels (manufactured housing, eco-speck cars, and vat grown meat) then that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;segment of industry requires a far smaller segment of the population to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;and far smaller percent of per capita income to acquire (just as has happened
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with food production), then that segment of the economy takes on less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;importance, as he claims. He myopically fails to forsee any progress in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;technologies for reducing the cost of these commodities in 100 years time,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I find to be a huge fault of his argument.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'll side with Krugman here; yours is a nanosanta scenario where all consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goods are as cheap as wheat.  Krugman forsees progress in the cost of ordinary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumer goods, but the same sort of progress we have seen.  So I'd bet he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't expect a nanosanta tech to be available in a century (if ever). He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be wrong about that, but if so it's not because of bad economics.
</EM><BR>
<P>Its doesn't necessarily require a nanosanta at all. normal scale
<BR>
autoreplicators/automated refinery/assembly processors are sufficient to bring
<BR>
the cost of cars, houses, refrigerators, stoves, and microwave ovens down to a
<BR>
commodity/disposable cost range:
<BR>
<P>Homes that are inflatable with a hardening structural foam can be mass produced
<BR>
as easily as air matresses.
<BR>
<P>Cars, well, bring an anti-trust suit against the UAW and 90% of all auto
<BR>
industry jobs will be robotized in ten years, get rid of dealerships. Basic cars
<BR>
should be as inexpensive as bicycles are.
<BR>
<P>refrigerators with 3 cubic foot capacity can be had for $100 already. I had
<BR>
three in my college dorm 14 years ago. The 6.5 cubic foot AC/propane refer I put
<BR>
in my camp last summer cost $300
<BR>
<P>Stoves: are cheap two burner gas or electric stoves can be had for $100
<BR>
<P>Microwave ovens: less than $100
<BR>
<P>These are all US prices, I know for a fact they can be had far cheaper in many
<BR>
asian countries. What is expensive is energy, as most nations lack
<BR>
infrastructure in roads, electric transmission, gas pipelines and retail
<BR>
distribution and sales of products. Taxes on energy and other items are highly
<BR>
punitive, exceeding 100% in many cases.
<BR>
<P>Just as with starvation and malnutrition, the problem is not with availability,
<BR>
price, or supply, it is with the tyranny of the governments that do not want to
<BR>
empower their subjects, leaders who see governance as an opportunity to rape the
<BR>
nation rather than to build it.
