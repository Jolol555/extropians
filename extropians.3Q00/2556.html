<P><EM>&gt; Therefore I would never argue (and have never argued) that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Napstering copyrighted music is a good 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing for those who own the copyrights.  So sure, from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point of view of the artist/record company* Napster is a “bad”
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thing.  No argument there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I try to look at this question from the broadest possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view.  Not merely from the standpoint of the copyright holders,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nor merely from the standpoint of the pirates.  But from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view of trying to determine the absolute or “greater good.”
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;In the past, whole industries have suffered when technology 
<BR>
threatened to destroy their market by altering the way society 
<BR>
worked. Naturally, they opposed this change and attempted to halt 
<BR>
progress.
<BR>
&nbsp;I think most people on this list, however, would acknowledge 
<BR>
that those changes were good when they happened to the railroad 
<BR>
industry (just the first thing that came to mind), or anything 
<BR>
else that stood in the way of progress. The good of society (our 
<BR>
good) is more important than the good of any particular industry, 
<BR>
and actually, by opposing progress, the people involved in the 
<BR>
industry were hurting themselves.
<BR>
&nbsp;However, when it comes to intellectual property, apparently it 
<BR>
strikes a little closer to home, perhaps because more people on 
<BR>
this list make a living off of the products of their mind than in 
<BR>
a more average group. It seems to me, though, that the issue is 
<BR>
the same. It will ultimately come down to a fight between the 
<BR>
(relatively small number of) artists and record companies who 
<BR>
want to protect their creations, and the larger populace who want 
<BR>
to consume them. It seems to me arrogant to assume that our 
<BR>
industry is so much different than all the ones that came before. 
<BR>
Certainly, the general public (or at least, the Napster fans) 
<BR>
don't see any difference.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;As an amature artist (song-writer/guitar player for 3 years) the 
<BR>
idea of IP seems very attractive (people pay me money every time 
<BR>
they listen to my song? wow!) But from the broader view, I have 
<BR>
to say that IP looks like an obstruction to our progress in 
<BR>
general. I think the micropayment plan would have been a good 
<BR>
intermediate step between the &quot;current system&quot; and &quot;information 
<BR>
is free&quot;, but since we've already leaped past that option, I 
<BR>
think record companies and artists now have to deal with reality, 
<BR>
and accept the death of IP.
