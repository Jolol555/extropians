BARBARA LAMAR SAID: &quot;...If it ( hyperadvanced AI...) considered us no more
<BR>
than a feature of the landscape (and my best guess is that this is the way
<BR>
it would see us),
<BR>
<P><P>CYMM SAYS: That's is likely; if the transformation from its
<BR>
observer-universe complex (...it's frame of reference...) to ours were much
<BR>
more than affine, then it might not even be able to compose the features
<BR>
that it detects into objects representing us... and vice verse... a sort of
<BR>
two-way uh, fermi paradox is it?...
