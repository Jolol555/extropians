<EM>&gt;  As the size of the benefit gets up into the trillions of dollars, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effects start to resemble making one person a world dictator. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this kind of consideration that would probably cause me to oppose a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;benefit&quot; of this sort that exceeded something like $100 billion.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I will be reluctant to believe people who are claiming they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;support giving someone $100 trillion until they explain why they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't deterred by the maxim &quot;power corrupts&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>The easiest response is to deny the maxim.  If wealth = power, then
<BR>
the fact that we are a lot richer than our ancestors, but not a lot
<BR>
more corrupt, suggests that wealth-power does not corrupt.  Perhaps
<BR>
you mean relative wealth = power.  But it is not clear to me that
<BR>
richer people tend to be more corrupt.  And even if this were true
<BR>
the cause might go the other way -- corruption tends to acquire power.
<BR>
If so, handing a person unexpected wealth might not corrupt them,
<BR>
though it might well cause them to be suddenly surrounded by lots
<BR>
of corrupt people.
<BR>
<P>Actually the sad fact is that few legal systems in the world would
<BR>
allow someone to keep most of $100 trillion given to them.  Far
<BR>
more likely it would get stolen from them in some way that was
<BR>
sanctioned by the powers that be.  Even then it might be a net
<BR>
benefit to humanity.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I think this exercise does a good job of illuminating some of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;motives for opposing superhumanism, ...
</EM><BR>
<P>That was my reason for posting it here.
