As reported today on CNN: Napster CEO, Metallica drummer to testify on
<BR>
digital music. Read the whole thing at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2000/LAW/07/11/napster.hearing.reut/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2000/LAW/07/11/napster.hearing.reut/index.html</A>
<BR>
<P>I'd like to also say, that as a person who used to be in a band: Creativity
<BR>
in itself, can be just as difficult work as any other sort. Meaning the
<BR>
taste of a year or two sweat can become quite bitter when someone else
<BR>
contributes access to your work, without your consent or collaboration. On
<BR>
the other hand,
<BR>
as one with great absorption of the audio environment, I still purchase
<BR>
clear, crisp CD sound, as opposed to fuzzy downloads. I don't think those in
<BR>
the industry are blind to the advances, I think as progress occurs it will
<BR>
take some time, to evaluate how to deal with it properly. This is not just
<BR>
with music, when the route at which things are being achieved, changes, or
<BR>
is advancing towards change, it becomes a topic of discussion. This is due
<BR>
to the fact that we as a society have to adapt to something new, that we may
<BR>
have been doing a different way for many years. (i.e.. the internet, nukes,
<BR>
cars, cell phones, Bill Joy-nano/AI- cryo, blah, blah blah) This is all part
<BR>
of the process, I am not shocked.

<P><P><EM>&gt; The archives of this list contain many discussions about how artists
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make money in a world without copyrights.  It never ceases to amaze me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that people who claim to be creative have such a pathetic lack of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imagination for business models, blindly assuming that the standard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old method of selling recordings is all there is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can also check out the archives of the Freenet project for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussions about the topic (<A HREF="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/">http://freenet.sourceforge.net/</A>).
