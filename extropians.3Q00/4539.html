<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Jon Reeves&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jon@electronsky.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20Why%20would%20AI%20want%20to%20be%20friendly?&In-Reply-To=&lt;F1489uV54Ogddu5qE8D0000c5e1@hotmail.com&gt;">jon@electronsky.co.uk</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I've been reading this thread with interest (sorry - lurking again), and I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think the question that is more to the point is &quot;Why would AI want to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;_unfriendly_?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The extermination (or enslavement) of several billion people would surely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;require an expenditure of a considerable amount of time and energy - even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for an SI.  What motivation could it have for doing so ?
</EM><BR>
<P>My concern was not that AI would want to exterminate or enslave us.  My 
<BR>
concern is that it would soon be bored with us and decide to seek out its 
<BR>
own interests in the world, rather than catering to our petty and inane 
<BR>
needs and desires.
<BR>
<P>I don't think that intelligence and emotions necessarily go hand in hand.  A 
<BR>
supremely intelligent being (without any emotional baggage) would have no 
<BR>
qualms seeking to satisfy its intellectual curiosity without regard to such 
<BR>
concerns as pity, guilt or empathy.  Therefore if, say, the AI thought it 
<BR>
might be a fascinating experiment to build a Dyson sphere around the sun to 
<BR>
capture *all* of its energy in order to power itself, it may well commence 
<BR>
to do so without any concern over the fact that we puny humans would not 
<BR>
fare very well without sun light.
<BR>
<P>I don't imagine that AI would have much to gain by intentionally seeking to 
<BR>
hurt us dumb animals, but I think we could possibly have just as much to 
<BR>
fear from an AI who, rather than actively seeking to harm us, merely 
<BR>
disregarded us as irrelevant and inconsequential idiots.
