<P>.&gt; Personally, if the man was lied to, then the woman should either be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; forced to either abort, OR accept the father's dissolution of rights and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support. That is a perfectly fair reproductive choice to make.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't think every unplanned pregnancy was because &quot;the man was
<BR>
lied to&quot; by the woman. I find it peculiar that you would explain away two
<BR>
consenting adults with such a devious explanation. (I doubt that most
<BR>
&nbsp;situations are due to such Jerry Springer antics)The two parties both
<BR>
participated in the risk,(and everyone does know the risks, both man and
<BR>
woman) There are many reasons that an unwanted pregnancy could result.
<BR>
No, I don't believe it would be fair to force an abortion on a woman
<BR>
(physical,
<BR>
and emotional trauma) and I highly doubt that abortions will ever be forced
<BR>
on anyone (excluding medical emergency, which still isn't forced). Legally,
<BR>
that's just not going to take. Your other 'alternative/choice&quot; is that if a
<BR>
woman
<BR>
refuses abortion, that she should then take care of the child, (who is
<BR>
indeed
<BR>
his as well) while he shouldn't have to contribute emotional or financial
<BR>
responsibility.
<BR>
<P><P>Of course, I'm sure this is gonna piss off at least a few of the women on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the list. I personally think that the lack of application of consent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here is a major legal hole.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny you should say that (about to puke) your reasonable (in pure
<BR>
jest) 'resolution' of such a situation is shockingly selfish, not only in
<BR>
leaving all consequences on the female of the -two- who took the risk,
<BR>
but for the child as well. It's as if your scenario implies she had sex with
<BR>
herself. (I smell cop out)
