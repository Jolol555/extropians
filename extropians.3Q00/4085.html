Entrypoint had a news item today about recent changes to
<BR>
the Amazon privacy policy.  Amazon apparently is now viewing
<BR>
customer information as an &quot;asset&quot; that may be freely traded.
<BR>
<P>Policy URL: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/misc/policy/privacy.html">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/misc/policy/privacy.html</A>
<BR>
<P>This is probably related to the FTC stomping on the transfer
<BR>
of information in the wake of the eToys demise and Amazon
<BR>
perhaps wanting to create a smooth path for asset shedding
<BR>
if they get into a tight financial spot.
<BR>
<P>So, I'd urge you all with Amazon accounts to write them a letter
<BR>
letting them know that you don't want to receive more unsolicited
<BR>
mail if Amazon goes belly up.  My letter is attached below.
<BR>
<P>Also of interest is the fact that Amazon has never subscribed to
<BR>
TRUSTe's policies (www.TRUSTe.com), perhaps because Amazon may have
<BR>
predated TRUSTe.  But it would be nice to move Amazon in a more
<BR>
consumer friendly direction.

Subject: Recent changes to privacy policy
<BR>
<P>Hello,
<BR>
<P>I have recently read about changes to your privacy policy in
<BR>
the New York Times.  I have reviewed your revised privacy policy.
<BR>
<P>I have a *SIGNIFICANT* problem with your &quot;Business Transfers&quot;
<BR>
policy:
<BR>
<P>&quot;As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or
<BR>
assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of
<BR>
the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that
<BR>
Amazon.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired,
<BR>
customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.&quot;
<BR>
<P>My name, address, mailing information buying history, etc. ARE NOT
<BR>
the property of Amazon.com.  They are MY PROPERTY and you only have
<BR>
the right to use them in so far as I have expressly granted you the
<BR>
right to use them in providing a service that I HAVE PAID FOR, namely
<BR>
selling me thousands of dollars of books that I have in the past
<BR>
purchased from you.
<BR>
<P><P>Please confirm IN WRITING, that you will abide by this policy.  To wit
<BR>
I expect a statement of the general form:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Amazon.com confirms that it WILL NOT sell or transfer your name,
<BR>
email or postal address or order history to any other corporate entity
<BR>
or organization without your express permission.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Without such a confirmation, I feel that I cannot be a customer of
<BR>
Amazon and will delete my account.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
Robert Bradbury
<BR>
