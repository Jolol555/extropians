</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A message to the elves of the night
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The destruction of GE crops is on the rise in North America. In the past
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;six months there have been numerous assaults on GE crops in Maine,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Vermont, Minnesota, California and British Columbia. This is a perfect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example of a case where the enemy is weaker than one might think. Test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crops are easy to destroy, anyone can cut down a crop, yet the destruction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of test crops costs seed companies considerable time. The work of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;high tech companies can be disrupted by the most simple means. This is one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the reasons why the sabotage of crops has spread so widely. Because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the outrage over genetically modified foods many have taken direct action
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against capital. But there are many other simple ways to attack capital,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so why stop there now that so many people have practice as elves of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;night?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The sabotage of genetically modified crops is aimed at a new technological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;development, in this case a biotechnological development. Its aim is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cripple the advance of technology, which was also the aim of the Luddites
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The most recent advances are often the only forms of technology to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;critiqued or attacked because they are the most shocking. But these recent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advances are not separate from other forms of technology, they function
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systematically with other technologies for the utility of capital: the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exploitation of nature and human beings. It is far more common to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;critical of the most advanced forms of technology while the machines that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Luddites had sabotaged now seem benign. This is because we have grown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up with them and often fail to see their negative effects. It is much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easier to be critical of the technologies that we are unfamiliar with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because we can still perceive their destructive and alien qualities. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;example, it is easier to see that the internet is alienating and replaces
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contact with real human beings or that it increases control, than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;telephone. We are blind to the effects of the telephone because for us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these effects have always been there. This naturalization of technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also blinds us from seeing technology as a system. We see instead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proliferation of &quot;tools&quot;. But, for what end are these tools made? Are they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;merely made for a variety of individual human uses to fulfill a variety of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual needs or are they produced by systems for the use of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems? Technology is produced by capitalist companies and governments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for their use. These technologies are a product of the logic of capital.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Our critique and our attacks must reach beyond the most recent advances of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the technological system to other technological means of exploitation and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alienation. Elves of the night, there is so much to do!
</EM><BR>
<P>I detect eerie echos of Kaczynski's Unabomber manifesto in this.
