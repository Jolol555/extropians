<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; already have AI machinery to surpass human equivalency?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Not on this planet.  Maybe you want to call on Ashtar High Command or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some such. :-)  They've been feeding us all of this tech anyway, don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ya know?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about the &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;, some little AI seed that will grow by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic algorithms until it knows all?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Where do you propose this seed came from?  Do you honestly think we are
<BR>
capable of creating it next year?  Don't confuse fiction with reality. 
<BR>
We live in sci-fi times but let's keep some groundedness for the sake of
<BR>
halfway decent real-world plots.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Qualitative is not overwhelming?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I listed 4 particular areas. The fact that significant progress has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made in all 4 seems hopeful to me. For example, a computer programmer from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Australia sent me 390 k. on a program for grade one reading (if anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wants it just let me know off-list). I'm not even sure there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; qualitative problem to be overcome here. Can you give an example of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; passage of grade one reading for which we can't program questions with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct answers? If not, the programmers go on to grade two and so on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What are the inventions required in the other 3 areas I mentioned?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Sigh.  If you are not sure there are qualitative problems then go read
<BR>
the literature.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   This has to be a joke.  We have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; idea what qualia even are among other &quot;qualitative&quot; problems of reaching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; human level intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I think the specialists working in these areas will be able to give a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clear statement on what they need to progress. For example, if it is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem which has to do with edge detection for object
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recognition/itemization they will be able to say so. That is what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proposed EDTV-Robotics-State-Of-The-Art program needs to know. I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interested in writing the script for another &quot;golly gosh&quot; ed tv program to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;wow&quot; the public and provide a little education at the same time. I need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these precise statements of what if needed to progess, eg huge amounts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; additional labor using known technology or inventions of something new.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>No.  They don't give a very clear statement except of those areas we
<BR>
already have a fair amount of understanding of.  In the tougher areas we
<BR>
cannot yet clearly state what is needed because we don't have that much
<BR>
clarity on what the functional parts are or how they hook together or
<BR>
what the resultants are (like the hard problem of consciousness).  And
<BR>
no, we will not solve the problems in one year or even have the full
<BR>
statement of what is needed.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   We have relatively poor grasp of even higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; level issues like concept formation and usage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And I can list these esoteric and mentalist notions until the cows come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; home. How about consciousness, common sense, comphrehension,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contemplation....? Watson's 1913 ms. in Psych Review exorcised mentalism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from scientific psychology. My own personal philosophy is dualistic so I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't take the &quot;strong behaviourist&quot; position but I use it for practical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; purposes. For a generation before Binet's very practical approach to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence testing in 1905, psychologists spent enormous amounts of time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with this mentalistic navel gazing. They got nowhere.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Those &quot;esoteric and mentalist notions&quot; are a large part of what human
<BR>
consciousness and human-level fucntion is about.  If you are going to
<BR>
play silly reductionist games then I wish you luck but don't pretend the
<BR>
result is a true human-level consciousness.  Concept formation is most
<BR>
certainly not &quot;esoteric&quot;.  It is meat and potatoes of a truly
<BR>
intelligent entity capable of learning and especially capable of
<BR>
consciously directed concept manipulation. I would like to see you get
<BR>
something like human self-awareness and thinking without this. 
<BR>
<P>A lot has happened since 1905 that does not allow such slighting of such
<BR>
simple aspects of higher intelligence.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;    I don't mean to be harsh because I think a number of disciplines are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required to solve the problems presented in AI, but I wonder how many AI
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workers have ever studied the history of trying to measure/observe/define
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real human intelligence, let alone ever given an IQ test? What I see is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot of people treading the same ground with artificial humanoid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligence that philosophers-psychologists-educators-physicians had trod
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with real human intelligence before practical, operational psychometrics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; came along. And it is expected they would do so. After all aren't they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to simulate real human intelligence?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends a lot on what you call &quot;real&quot; doesn't it?  That itself is not a
<BR>
closed topic.  Operational psychometrics are not the end and be-all of
<BR>
such questions.  
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Lots of theory, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; satisfying fully general and full powered learning programs.  No model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; we are even happy about for describing what humans do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; percept-concept-more abstract concept chains.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just give one example of such a chain which cannot be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; verbalized. Skinner's dictum was &quot;If it can be verbalized it can be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmed&quot;. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I have nothing at all to say to anyone who is so backwards to quote
<BR>
Skinner in this conversation.
