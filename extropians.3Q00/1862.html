induced at least in part because customers did not like the added stress

of having the decision to read the next page or whatever be an economic

decision, as opposed to something they could not get in monetary trouble

for if they let themselves do again and again.)

<P>Actually, some of them (like the ones I work with) do have to deal with
<BR>
returns - insofar as they have to refund the purchase.  They don't have
<BR>
to deal with restocking, which does cut their costs a bit, but the
<BR>
time of a serviceperson to enter the return and the fees the credit
<BR>
card companies charge for excessive returns (which, in their eyes,
<BR>
indicate fradulent transactions) covers more than half the cost of a
<BR>
return.  (And servicing returns would seem to account for far less than
<BR>
third of a book's price, so even if there were no returns, that wouldn't
<BR>
come anywhere near cutting costs by a third, to say nothing of a full
<BR>
half.)
