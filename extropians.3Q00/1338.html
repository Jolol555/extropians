<P>
I have been playing some of this Shogun:Total War, totalwar.com, it is a decent
<BR>
tactics game.  Basically, there is a strategy-style campaign with individual
<BR>
real-time tactics battles.  I call them real-time tactics instead of real-time
<BR>
strategy because the battles are true to scale.
<BR>
<P>The units can be assembled in various formations, and they appear to use
<BR>
flocking behavior to implement the troop movements.  There is a semi-realisitc
<BR>
combat model with various troop types including morale, and some hundreds of Sun
<BR>
Tzu's &quot;Art of War&quot; syllogisms are implemented into the game rules.
<BR>
<P>There is online play capability where up to eight players battle with up to
<BR>
thousands of units on the field at a time.
<BR>
<P>I have passed that campaign, other games recently completed, more or less, (in
<BR>
the last year) are Dungeon Keeper 2, Mechwarrior 3, Half-Life, Rogue Spear,
<BR>
Homeworld, Starcraft and Brood Wars, each sans override codes.  Each of those is
<BR>
in either the &quot;real-time strategy&quot; or &quot;first-person action shooter&quot; genre.  I'm
<BR>
halfway-decently skilled at each of them.  I've never played Empire or Utopia,
<BR>
yet I have played various video games from the Commodore 64 (the first great
<BR>
video game personal computer) onward..
<BR>
<P>These games don't particularly reflect life for anyone, although many have
<BR>
semblances to reality and physically realistic game rules.
<BR>
<P>In terms of habits or addictions, except for cigarette smoking, I probably play
<BR>
too many video games when I should be coding for money, otherwise everything
<BR>
available in moderation.
<BR>
<P>In my opinion, addiction as inability to stop deleterious habit is almost
<BR>
completely psychosomatic, although some drugs' disuse elicits physical
<BR>
withdrawal symptoms.
<BR>
<P>About psycho- or neuro-pharmaceuticals:  Ritalin is an amphetamine-like
<BR>
stimulant, alcohol is quite poisonous, many of these prescribed drugs are
<BR>
largely placebos, and otherwise hammers.  Nicotine is supposedly a nootropic,
<BR>
and THC is really great, and has never killed anyone.
<BR>
<P>Video game success probably releases some endorphins or something.  I go brew
<BR>
some coffee.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A warning: I'm someone with an addictive personallity, quite obsessive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Various members of my extended family have ridiculous addiction problems; I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confine my drug intake strictly to caffeine, to which I am a hopelessly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; addicted. Luckily, that is regarded almost as highly as professional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; association membership for coders.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My other major problem addiction, especially a problem in Uni, is arcade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; games. Before you scoff, I must admit I was spending $50 plus a week on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them, when I was on an income of around $100 a week (ack, student life).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are worse addictions in the world (I've worked in a bar and watched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Poker machine addicts go for it; misery), but I think it is real. I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; walk past computer game arcades now if I can help it (because I don't walk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; past them, if you catch my drift).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway, I own two computer game CDs now, and hardly ever put them near my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PC; somehow I can't get them out of the CD drive once they go in.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought Utopia would be safe; it's a strategy game, all text based, how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bad could it be? Hmm. I estimate that it soaks a minimum of an hour a day.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At heavy times, it can push to four hours. That's truly detrimental. It's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really, really addictive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Luckily, massively multiplayer online games are also entirely new (I mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; games with, say, 10,000 players plus), and so the experience of such a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gaming environment is entirely worth (or at least partially compensates) the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investment. It really is qualitatively different from any small scale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game.I've played play-by-mails with over 200 players in the past, but it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; just not the same as this. You've never felt so insignificant as when you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are competing with tens of thousands of other players! I think people should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the time to try things like this; it helps bring home very personally a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modern truth, which is that the number of other people in the world is more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than you can comprehend in any significant sense. Even 40,000 people is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot of people. Too many to get a mental picture of.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You've been warned.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (if anyone is actually going to start playing, have a look soon. The new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; round is starting in the next week or two, it's the ideal time to get a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feeling for the game. When the new round starts, you need to know what is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on from day 1. I can send people a list of the most important
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; player-maintained strategy and support software sites out there; you cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be competitive without checking these sites out)

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; In this game, you play a fantasy province; Orcs, elves dwarves,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; halflings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (yawn, yep same old stuff). It has a interestingly simplistic geographic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; model - there's no map, you just exist in this abstract world, with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; certain amount of acres of land, all kinds of production statistics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; settings which lead ultimately to an expansion rate of population
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (particularly limited by land) and income level (production rate of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gold).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You use those things to make an army, and you use your army to get more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; land.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Gadzooks, this sounds like a cross between Middle Earth and Empire.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Your summary would agree with conclusions that were reached by many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the first Empire addicts (including myself) back in the mid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1970's when Peter Langston first made the game available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Did anyone else on the list ever play Empire?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Also, is there a URL for Utopia?
