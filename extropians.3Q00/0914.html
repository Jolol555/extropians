</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One proposal turns art from a product into a service.  That is, you pay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the artist for his time, not for each copy of the output.  An artist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would agree to release a new artwork only when enough people had pledged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to pay for it.  Once it was released, it would be freely available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He might release a partial or low-quality version ahead of time to show
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people what the final product would be like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>That's actually quite a cool idea. You might combine an idea of &quot;private
<BR>
clubs&quot; with art produced this way. Kind of like patronage for the masses.
<BR>
Everyone who chips in gets to be a paid-up member, with all kinds of extra
<BR>
priveleges with regard to merchandise, artist contact, and being legally
<BR>
allowed to call themselves whatever the &quot;club members&quot; are called (king
<BR>
doody chicken, or something like that) etc, which cannot be bought after the
<BR>
pledge amount is reached. People love to be members of elite (or not so
<BR>
elite) clubs, this would work rather well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now there are obvious problems with this, and I will mention one or two.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, the important thing to keep in mind is, this is not intended to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maintain the status quo.  It may turn out that not as many artists (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmers) get paid as much as they get paid today.  We don't know the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shape of the future, but obviously things will be different, and this may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be an area where things change.  If it seems that this system will cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less art to be produced, we know that supply and demand will drive the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price of the artist's labor upward.  The net result is hard to predict.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think it's probably quite workable. It's got some warts (using information
<BR>
hiding instead of true ownership), but it's probably quite strong.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The first objection is the &quot;free rider&quot; problem.  Why should anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pledge if they know they can get the work for free once others have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pledged enough?  The reason is because if everyone thinks this way, they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; won't get any art.  So sooner or later people will break down and pledge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; People pay money now for PBS and other services they could get for free,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for exactly this reason.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are right about this, with one caveat; it depends highly on the
<BR>
dominant memes out there. If the dominant meme is &quot;you should support
<BR>
creators of art whose work you consume&quot;, then that's ok. If the dominant
<BR>
meme is &quot;f*ck the system, I'm not paying nuthin&quot;, then it's not so good. I
<BR>
think Napster promotes the second meme, and they get rich doing it,
<BR>
pretending they are the People's Hero. Scum.
<BR>
<P>This actually strongly highlights the urgent need for a secure electronic
<BR>
cash system. I know that I freeride on the net as much as (more than) anyone
<BR>
else. Why? Because I need instant gratification, and I don't often have an
<BR>
easy way to pay (stuck with an Australia only credit card, for one thing,
<BR>
d'oh!), and even if I do, it's often  so much more of a hassle to pay for
<BR>
quality when you can get something dodgy for free. Convenience is far more
<BR>
of a concern than price to me. I don't think I'm alone on this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The second objection is how new artists get started.  Why should anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay for the work of an untried artist?  New artists would have to release
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their works for free, initially.  Novelists could publish the first half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of their novel freely, then demand payment to finish it.  Musicians could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; release some songs, then demand payment to make more.  This is really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not all that different from the current system.  Artists seldom make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much money right off the bat.  They need to build up a reputation first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another problem is whether people could get advance payment on unpublished
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works, as established artists can do today from their publishers.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think the same system could work in the future, with a middleman acquiring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the legal rights to the payment for the released work in exchange for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; granting an advance fee.  Another way to look at it is as an unsecured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loan, based on the reputation of the artist.  The economics of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advances wouldn't be all that different from today.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think in fact you would find that it would look much like today's
<BR>
industry. This relates to what I said in a previous post, that the marketing
<BR>
function of record companies is not threatened at all by the move to zero
<BR>
cost distribution, and neither by the removal of intellectual property
<BR>
rights. Many people want to be told what to consume, or will believe the
<BR>
messages when they hear them. The record companies are not going to shrivel;
<BR>
the smart ones will strengthen in such an environment, and artists will
<BR>
become increasingly dependent on them. One such way for them to prosper
<BR>
would be to adopt the system outlined above.
<BR>
<P>The net is in an interesting period right now; lots of stuff for free,
<BR>
because lots of big orgs are willing to lose a lot of money. Why? Because
<BR>
they all want to become (the money losing) Amazon.com in their sector, and
<BR>
they'll pay for the privelege. And why is that? Because they understand the
<BR>
principle (it comes from Biology, what's it's damn name again?) that the
<BR>
first (clear leader) in the market has a massive advantage in the long run.
<BR>
We could call it the Microsoft principle.
<BR>
<P>Music will be such an area. Who will become Amazon/Microsoft, where the
<BR>
majority of people go by default to get music. MP3.com (whose business model
<BR>
I wholeheartedly support; very sound), Napster, or some big commercial shop?
<BR>
<P>Once things bed down, and consumers have turned to the net as their primary
<BR>
consumption medium, it's going to be very hard for an artist without company
<BR>
backing (by company I mean the gatekeepers of these centers of commerce, or
<BR>
someone with access to the gatekeepers). If anything,
<BR>
artists are going to be more screwed than before.
<BR>
<P>What's the crucial point? Once information is &quot;free&quot;, ie: not owned, then
<BR>
true value (or money making ability, anyway) will be vested almost solely in
<BR>
the most successful meme spreaders. There's already an entire industry built
<BR>
around this, which people seem to forget about when talking information
<BR>
freedom, and that's the professional communications disciplines of PR,
<BR>
marketing, and advertising (which I think are busily merging into one
<BR>
mega-comms discipline even now - the dark side of the force!). Politicians
<BR>
and maybe journos have some happy future there too (or maybe journos fall
<BR>
into the same camp as the artists).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Horror author Stephen King has been proposing an experiment along these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lines, where he would offer a novel online if he got enough people to pay.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then they would be free to share the novel with others.
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there now but it says to check back later in the week.

<P>I'll check it out; that's interesting. I'm not sure that I'd waste my time
<BR>
by reading the book, but hey.
