</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world of scarcity where even mere surival actually is pretty problematic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The trouble is we haven't thought past genetic conditioning that is largely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outmoded.   - samantha &gt;&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Samantha,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Can you imagine the greed, jealousy and short sightedness present in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people that don't want to see others have anything?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I was raised in a poor segment of society.  Early on I was let hnow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my ticket out was in &quot;hitting the books.&quot;  When I was in college I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ridiculed gently by my friends for not going to work and &quot;making some 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;money.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Early in my career, the &quot;sphagetti years,&quot; those same friends offered to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help me get a &quot;good job.&quot;  Then when things came my way they said, &quot;I never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had it lucky like you.&quot;  Now that we are all retired they want the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;govament&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to give them more.  They never connect the dots and realise the money to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;give them more&quot; will come from their very children that need the money to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;raise their grandchildren.  Yet statistics show that we retirees have more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discretionary income than the group that is raising children.  Greed and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of foresight.

<P><P><P>So then what are you saying? You worked harder thna others and 
<BR>
*prevailed*...over them?
<BR>
Thanks for making my point: society is a competition...there are winnners 
<BR>
and losers.
<BR>
<P>And BTW, what effect did timing and luck have to do with the relattive 
<BR>
wealth of the WWII-Korean War generation?
