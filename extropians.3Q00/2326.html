<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, there is no evidence that butterflies are harmed by pesticides

<EM>&gt; &gt; produced by plants in the field, and evidence to the contrary has been

<EM>&gt; pretty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; overwhelming that the 'sky is falling' whines of the anti-GM greenies is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unfounded in any way.

<EM>&gt; I was under the impression that it was pretty well established that the GM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wheat was poisonous to Monarch butterflies, even though it was designed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have pesticides that would not harm butterflies.  The concern was not for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;poor Monarch butterfly&quot;, but that the intended design parameters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obviously didn't work as expected in the final product.  The plant is still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered safe for human consumption, but anti-GMs still quote this as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence that unexpected side-effects can and do occur with GM foods, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with any new technology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is from memory of popular media reports (and we all know how accurate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are!).  References to real facts would be welcomed.
</EM><BR>
<P>The anti-GM paranoiacs were CLAIMING that it would be harmful. THis was
<BR>
their argument against letting it be used in crops. In practice,
<BR>
however, it has shown no impact upon the Monarch, as the Monarch either
<BR>
does not regard corn pollen as a normal food, or is not dependent upon
<BR>
it and can taste the pesticide once they've slightly sampled the pollen,
<BR>
and thereafter they avoid the corn that smells or tastes that way. Of
<BR>
course, the media presented the anti-GM argument as if it had
<BR>
significant science supporting it, which it didn't. All they could show
<BR>
was that butterflies in the lab that were not allowed to eat anything
<BR>
but the tainted pollen did die. The fact that lab butterflies were not
<BR>
given an option demonstrates the bad science inherent in that particular
<BR>
study.
