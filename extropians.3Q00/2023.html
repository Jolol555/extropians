Just a few thoughts:

<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Shakespeare'(snip)wasn't afraid to go for the cheap laugh of
</EM><BR>
a dirty joke or a pun where needed, and his brilliant use of
<BR>
language and poetic form wasn't to challenge his audience's mind,
<BR>
but simply to entertain them.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Alternatively, I think that the writing of Shakekspeare both
<BR>
challenges and entertains.

<P><EM>&gt;This multilevel inventiveness - where people of all levels are
</EM><BR>
indulged - to the extent that they will pay - is, indeed, the
<BR>
most brilliant type of art (snip)&lt;.
<BR>
<P>I like indulging multi-levles of interplay, but I think that
<BR>
statement might digitizes art into a corner.  I tend to steer
<BR>
away from giving absolutes on art -:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;To be more blunt about it, I think that &quot;really good art&quot; often
</EM><BR>
evolves out of financial need, (snip&lt;
<BR>
<P>I agree that Shakespeare’s uncanny ability to reach a broad audience
<BR>
works beautifully, I do not believe that there is a cultural
<BR>
valve on the quality of creative talents stemming from a person’s
<BR>
financial status.  This romanticizes artists and places emphasis
<BR>
on the struggling artist as a trophy rather than evaluating the
<BR>
work product.
<BR>
<P>(I’m not sure who wrote this clever sentence:)
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;He juggled the language like a street performer juggles torches,
</EM><BR>
as deftly and for the same purpose.  /That/ is the highest form
<BR>
of art.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Okay, quality fiction perhaps. I have trouble seeing complex
<BR>
word structures in non-literary arts or getting into high/low
<BR>
modifiers. But the metaphor works nicely.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;IMO, today's market can endure a lot more crap, as long as it's
</EM><BR>
packaged well. MacStevenKing burgers would sell great, I bet,
<BR>
if you put a couple action figures of N'Sync with the Happy Crappy
<BR>
Scary McMeal. Byte on that.&lt;
<BR>
<P>The graphic design used for packaging is art I really love a
<BR>
lot.  Some of my favorite designs are packaging.  I’m not a fan
<BR>
of Steven King, but I don’t have a problem with his art or whether
<BR>
he uses a template for writing.  N’Sync bothers me, but they
<BR>
are artists and have the right to do what they want.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;&gt;The term 'art' is often and variously described as an appeal
</EM><BR>
to aesthetics, a reflection or mutation of nature, or a work
<BR>
of the imagination designed to affect the sense of beauty.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenging or appealing to one's sense of aesthetics is
<BR>
a far cry from simple entertainment.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yes, but it takes education, refinement and a desire to learn
</EM><BR>
those standards; not everyone will take the time to do so. In
<BR>
our constantly changing world view, we are drawn back time and
<BR>
time again to older, more conservative art forms which do not
<BR>
really challenge us as much as they used to.&lt;
<BR>
<P>Contrarily, I have been challenged enormously by varied periods
<BR>
and genres of the arts and the artists who expressed themselves
<BR>
during those times.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Progressive art rarely has financial success at first, and large
</EM><BR>
project often fail. Take the example of rock bands who bring
<BR>
orchestras on tour with them and go broke. Then they end up suing
<BR>
Napster  ;o)&lt;
<BR>
<P>Progressive art often has financial success.  Assuming otherwise
<BR>
plays into the artist syndrome.  Often progressive artistic projects
<BR>
are not produced under the disciplinary category of the arts,
<BR>
but produces broad-minded and advanced artistic conceptions.
<BR>
&nbsp;The fact that such artistic conceptions may be produced in other
<BR>
fields may have little historical significance because sooner
<BR>
or later it will be referenced as &quot;state of the art.&quot;
