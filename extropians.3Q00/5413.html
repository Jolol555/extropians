<EM>&gt; The incidence of crimes committed by legal gun-owners is pretty low.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incidence of crimes committed by those legally carrying concealed is vanishingly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; small, and I think is mostly cops.  And, last I heard, only one violent crime
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is known to have been committed by a legal owner of a fully automatic weapon.
</EM><BR>
<P>And that one person was an off duty police officer who shot a crack dealer, so
<BR>
even that is questionable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In high school, in Israel, I rode the public bus to school each day.  I would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; routinely sit next to soldiers with shopping bags and Uzis.  Whenever we went on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; field trips, our teachers were armed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've often found the situation in Isreal rather interesting, in relation to Jews
<BR>
in the US. What are your impressions of any encounters you've had with the gun
<BR>
control positions that American Jews have, and what do they think of your
<BR>
opinions?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I once ran an event for the Libertarian Party.  I carried the proceeds for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evening on me, a few thousand dollars.  I belatedly wondered if we should have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; made arrangements for security.  The vice chair of the state party pointed out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to me that we were in a room of New Hampshire libertarians -- there were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably 200 people there carrying concealed.  Who would be foolish enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; try to rob us?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Modestly related) I rank gun owners -- your (and Mike's) mileage may vary --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in terms of safety as follows:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Safest:  target shooters.  Gun safety is inviolate.&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then:  military and police.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would separate these two by a large margin. David may be including his
<BR>
experience with Isreali police, which are a far cry from your average US
<BR>
policeman. Your typical US policeman today is a) 5 times more likely to kill an
<BR>
innnocent person at a crime scene than an armed civilian, and b) rarely, if
<BR>
ever, maintains his proficiency any more than the once a year manditory shoot,
<BR>
where civilians are typically banned because cops score so badly. This is not
<BR>
just my opinion, but that of several retired firearms instructors, including
<BR>
Massad Ayoob. At the shoot that was run at my club for the NH police convention
<BR>
this year, in the shotgun event, less than half the solid slugs shot even hit
<BR>
the target (regulation target that is 2' x 2' or more) at 50 yards. On rifle,
<BR>
pistol, and shotgun events, less than a few percent would have qualified under
<BR>
military standards. Many police I know dislike carrying firearms, and would not
<BR>
if they were allowed. These are also the ones who never practice with their
<BR>
firearms.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Next:  hunters.  Some are fine; others are the equivalent of Massachusetts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drivers -- brandishing their weapons, firing weapons within range of people's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; houses, drinking while hunting, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny, this is not my impression at all. Last year, a new Savage rifle I had
<BR>
bought did not operate safely: If you had pulled the trigger any time while the
<BR>
bolt was open, with the safety on, and then closed the bolt on a round (with
<BR>
finger off the trigger), it would fire. I was rather pointedly told NOT to even
<BR>
bring that gun back to camp until it was fixed. Replacing the trigger fixed that
<BR>
problem. People I know who are hunters are rather anal retentive about safety,
<BR>
and are rather particular who they hunt with.
<BR>
<P>I understand that there have been significant problems in the past with
<BR>
flatlanders who are new hunters, and don't pay attention to their safety
<BR>
classes, but the primary problem with hunter safety is not guns, or instruction,
<BR>
but alcohol. Where I hunt, its pretty standard policy in most camps that
<BR>
drinking only starts when the guns are put away.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Least:  liberals who get a gun for self-defense.  Since they abhor guns,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they typically never learn to use them safely.  Their kids are the most likely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be accidentally killed by guns because their parents hid the guns from them,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and never taught them gun safety.
</EM><BR>
<P>Their guns are also most likely to not only be stolen from them in burglaries,
<BR>
but are also most likely to have their guns taken from them in a confrontation,
<BR>
and are most likely to use lethal force illegally, or in messy divorces.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One thing I'm sure we all would agree upon, even Joe and Mike, is that if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own or carry a gun, it behooves you to learn how and when to use it safely.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you target-shoot, you should take an NRA class.  If you want to use a gun for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-defense, especially if you plan to carry concealed, you should take a class
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through the Lethal Force Institute, or equivalent.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the very least read Masa Ayoob's books on the subject and take a course from
<BR>
a local iinstructor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm leery of legally mandating this, because it gives the govt. too much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discretion, but I encourage insurance companies to collude, and require gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; training as a condition for issuing liability coverage to gun owners.  And I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also encourage them to give a 10% discount on a home policy for gun owners,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much as they give a discount for a deadbolt or burglar alarm.  Perhaps the city
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could also give trained owners a discount on their property taxes as well,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because of the reduction in crime city-wide.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, these are all good ideas, some of which I've noted previously.
