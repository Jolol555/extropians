<EM>&gt;Do you actually view it to be self-evident that we have a creator, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that he (sorry, &quot;He&quot;) endowed us with rights? I not only don't think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it is self-evident, but I don't even think it is at all likely. Is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the foundation for why you believe we should have an armed populace?
</EM><BR>
<P>Forrest responded:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; No, I do not &quot;believe&quot; in a god(s). No, this is not the reason for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; armed population. The reason is to keep goverment (and private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hoodlums) in check, to keep the would-be rulers constantly in fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the citizenry. This is the fundamental check and balance on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;political power&quot;, which, as Mao Tse-tung notes, &quot;grows out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the barrel of a gun&quot; [1].
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a better reason.  One problem is that not only government and
<BR>
hoodlums, but everyone else, lives constantly in fear of the citizenry.
<BR>
I remember when I went into a jewelry store where the proprietor wore
<BR>
a sidearm.  It was pretty scary knowing he could pull out his gun and
<BR>
shoot me dead at any time.  I didn't go back.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Taking a single point out of context is not a very effective means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of making a cogent argument. It can distract a reader from the essential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory, and lead one down irrelevant lines of inquiry. The &quot;founding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fathers&quot;, many of whom were deists [2], with a few christians, were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing for their time, as is quite evident in the remainder of this particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; document.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, but you started off with this stuff about being created by God
<BR>
who gave us rights.  Was I supposed to get a lump in my throat reading
<BR>
these revered documents?  The US' declaration of independence is a load
<BR>
of crap.  It has no more relevance to me than the story of Robin Hood
<BR>
and Good King John.  BTW that story teaches us that we should be armed
<BR>
so that we can rob from the rich and give to the poor.  Just quoting
<BR>
old documents is no argument.
