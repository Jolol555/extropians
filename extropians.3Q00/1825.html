<EM>&gt; &gt; A PC version of the old EMPIRE game can be freely downloaded from:-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://home.att.net/~wgb/">http://home.att.net/~wgb/</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What I have extracted from the pointers there is enough to convince
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me that the PC version is not the &quot;original&quot; Empire game.  It may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a knock-off or an alternately evolved variant.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is indeed a different game, written by Walter Bright, who was a
<BR>
year behind me in college and roomed across the hall from me.  Walter
<BR>
wrote the original version of his Empire in Fortran back in 1977 or so.
<BR>
Later he co-authored a version for the PC which appeared in the late 80s.
<BR>
But it is not the same Empire game that people have been talking about.
<BR>
<P>Walter went on to achieve considerable success as the sole author of
<BR>
Zortech C/C++, a popular development system in the 1980s which was
<BR>
eventually purchased by Symantec.
