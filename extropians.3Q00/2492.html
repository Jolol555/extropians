<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Except that linux is NOT free. It typically is sold on CD-ROM for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; $40-80, which is little different from other operating systems. Can I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; reproduce a Redhat CD-ROM and sell them for a buck if I want to? No, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; can't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, I think you can.   Check www.cheapbytes.com , which sells lots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of Linux and related stuff roughly at the costs of reproduction (even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Linux By The Pound&quot;). They have a whole &quot;Red Hat&quot; corner.  The $40-80 that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Official&quot; Red Hat costs is largely for the support RH supposedly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; offers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So the 'Official' Red Hat CANNOT be reproduced, and I cannot sell or give away
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the work of Red Hat (whether its their programming work or their Customer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Support work is really irrelevant, and a pointless distinction) without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; compensating them to the degree they desire.
</EM><BR>
<P>Irrelevant and pointless to you maybe, not to Linux hackers who don't want to
<BR>
spend time downloading but also don't need handholding and don't want to pay for
<BR>
it.  For them, all they need is the CD.  My understanding is that it's the
<BR>
customer support work that they're selling for your $40-80 or whatever, and that
<BR>
makes it &quot;official&quot;, i.e. you have to register the &quot;official&quot; package to talk to
<BR>
them.  You also get a manual.  I don't know the distributability of the manual
<BR>
offhand - I'd expect it's copyrighted.   You can reproduce Linux (and whatever
<BR>
else comes on the CD) as much as you want under the terms of the licenses of that
<BR>
software - GPL and variants.   You're free then to offer whatever support you want
<BR>
to provide, including none, at whatever terms you want.   Cheapbytes provides
<BR>
none.   Such software that Red Hat itself has added to its Linux distribution (not
<BR>
much, but RPM really makes life easier)  is under the GPL or comparable license as
<BR>
far as I'm aware; that's why Cheapbytes, and you, can distribute it.   I think
<BR>
they do have some products which are not distributable that way, but I don't
<BR>
follow their product line that closely to be sure.  Clearly, though, they're
<BR>
mainly in the business of selling _support_ - someone to call when things break,
<BR>
rather than original software.
