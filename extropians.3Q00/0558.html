<EM>&gt; &gt;  The question is really about philosophical principles, can one advocate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  transhumanism while sharing stasist views upon society?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Absolutely. And people do.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Such a person will not be in 100% accord with the Extropian principles that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Max has set forth, but they can be in accord with their own. And this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not be a call to begin wars and name calling! We've witnessed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fruitlessness of that all too often.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Philosophical convictions about economics, spiritual and ethical concerns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about computers/biotech/AI will often arrive at differing solutions for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;social concerns  - in other words, all the complicated issues are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;resolved. We must expect divergent experiential and political views. If 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do not concur with YOUR particular brand of reasoning, the best you can do 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to show the offending person that you are correct. You cannot expect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transhumanists to view things in a way you find axiomatic.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Diversity is to be expected.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sir,
<BR>
<P>Your reply has given me some serious doubts about transhumanism and 
<BR>
extropianism. It does not seem to be a philosophy that can give me any 
<BR>
practical guidance on how I should lead my life. It just boggs down to 
<BR>
technical discourses of some very far off technologies, that perhaps aren't 
<BR>
even possible to realize. But what about my life? Should I lose some pounds 
<BR>
of my weight, and what can I do if the public transports in my city are 
<BR>
really crappy? Others have answers to that. Transhumanism doesn't answer 
<BR>
those questions, in fact it seems to have difficulties even with describing 
<BR>
the state of the world nowadays anyway, nor its history or its future in 
<BR>
anything but in fluffy talk in some abstract quasi- religious terms. Is 
<BR>
globalisation a positive or negative thing, and how does one open up to 
<BR>
&quot;extropic lifestyles&quot;- what does it mean- sitting? Sitting down writing 
<BR>
mails on a computer? I like free trade and I think that I have the right to 
<BR>
bear arms, well, why debate this with extropians? I can do that at my local 
<BR>
libertarian club, after all.
<BR>
<P>No ideas, no solutions- there isn't much social life either, the parties and 
<BR>
club culture are not exactly a part of the scene. Nor does it have a 
<BR>
culture- why we should view all those romanticist raytracings as art I don't 
<BR>
know know?
<BR>
<P>The intellectuals of the movement seem to have moved on or left it. Very 
<BR>
little seems to be produced nowadays.
<BR>
<P>And really, as a businessman I am busy. Maybe I should take care more of my 
<BR>
store than with a quite technocratic movement that discusses bizarre 
<BR>
computers?
<BR>
<P>So please explain to me why I should keep on being a transhumanist
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
