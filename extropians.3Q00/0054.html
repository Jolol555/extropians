<P>I propose a little game, Steve.  Whoever gets the right prediction
<BR>
next Friday gets to repost the wrong-predictor's post.  No intention
<BR>
to embarrass, just a little light-hearted fun, kind of a cashless bet.
<BR>
I have no special insights here, it might well be *my* incorrect
<BR>
post that gets waved like a flag.  {8^D  Ya in?  Anyone else?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, I do believe that if ICBM defense were permitted as many test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; failures as it took to perfect ICBMs to begin with, it would become a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resounding success.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thats the spirit.  Why shouldnt it?
<BR>
<P>This line of reasoning does provide an insight however.  We extropians
<BR>
are focussed on the notion of a singularity of some sort,  so we are a
<BR>
little
<BR>
like the religionists predicting THE END of the world, the long-
<BR>
awaited apocalypse.  We think that if these NMD systems are not
<BR>
ready in the next 20 to 50 yrs, then the singularity will come along
<BR>
and its all quite pointless, right?  Well, think: what if...
<BR>
the singularity *doesnt* happen in the next 30 to 50?  What if some
<BR>
as-yet-unanticipated anti-singularity technology is discovered and
<BR>
launched?  What if the rate of technology change settles at some positive
<BR>
constant?  Does that possibility change anyone's outlook on NMD?  spike
