John M Grigg writes,
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Do we dare think we can program AI's so they will not turn against us, even as
</EM><BR>
they go about reprogramming and improving themselves?  A good question.
<BR>
<P>Well, if we didn't dare think it, then there wouldn't be any AIs to go about.

<P>&quot;What is it that puts humans in the relatively dominant position we are in on
<BR>
earth?
<BR>
I believe it is our intelligence, coupled with the power to do something about
<BR>
it. So if something more intelligent and more powerful comes along, the logic is
<BR>
that it will, most likely, be in the driving seat.
<BR>
If this is accepted, the argument is then directly down to will/can machines be
<BR>
more intelligent than humans? Even Roger Penrose agrees that this is the
<BR>
important question, and that if machines do become more intelligent than humans,
<BR>
we have problems.
<BR>
Can machines be more intelligent than humans? Read my book!&quot; [_In The Mind of
<BR>
The Machine_]
