<P><EM>         &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>         &gt;&gt;The best way to maximize anything is to make it a commodity, the market
</EM><BR>
<EM>         &gt;&gt;does exactly that with freedom and  justice.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt; Ah, so you're saying it is a commodity!?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; At least your honest about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;Until you can explain how those lacking key economic success tools can
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;also thrive in such a system, you're going to have a lot of resistance on your
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; hands, and the meme of socialism will continue to thrive.  My challenge to people
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;on this list is for them to convince the rest how such a system will benefit them
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;more than the one we have now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Apologies to the long time members of the list, I've said all this before.
<BR>
<P>In Anarcho- Capitalism, there would still be police and there would still be law,
<BR>
but it would be private police and private law. PPL's (privately produced law)
<BR>
in a anarchic world would have private protection agencies (PPA's) to
<BR>
back them up. Disputes among PPA's would be settled by an independent
<BR>
arbitrator agreed to by both parties BEFORE the disagreement happened.
<BR>
Something like that can happen today. When companies sign complicated
<BR>
contracts they sometimes also agree on who will arbitrate it if differences
<BR>
in interpretation happen. Nobody want to get caught up in the slow, expensive
<BR>
court system run by governments. The arbitrator would be paid by the case,
<BR>
and because he is picked by both sides, it's in his interest to be as just as
<BR>
possible. If he favored one side over another or made brutal or stupid
<BR>
decisions he would not be picked again and would need to look for a new line
<BR>
of work. Unlike present day judges and juries, justice would have a positive
<BR>
survival value for the arbitrator.
<BR>
<P>All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing
<BR>
parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence
<BR>
is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in
<BR>
making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect
<BR>
the total level of violence to be less than what we have now, but I'm not
<BR>
such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. Even when force is not
<BR>
used the implicit threat is always there, another good reason to be civilized.
<BR>
<P>And I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a  rich man's PPA makes
<BR>
unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on my
<BR>
mother being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's going to need one hell of
<BR>
a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is expensive because
<BR>
of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages it will
<BR>
need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for
<BR>
all this they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely
<BR>
limiting their customer base and that means even higher charges. They could
<BR>
never get the upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to
<BR>
outspend a PPA that had outrageous demands and was just for the super rich.
<BR>
A yacht cost a lot more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer
<BR>
than all the yacht builders on the planet combined.
<BR>
<P>No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the
<BR>
greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one
<BR>
man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans
<BR>
could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things
<BR>
aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,
<BR>
nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically .
<BR>
<P>In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to
<BR>
kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews  would be willing to pay as
<BR>
much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be
<BR>
killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%.
<BR>
As a result the PPA protecting Jews would be much stronger than the one that
<BR>
wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you
<BR>
( like not getting  killed) you have much more influence than just one man
<BR>
one vote.
<BR>
<P><EM>            &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>            &gt;&gt;Somebody is going to win it's just a question of who.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;And why is that?  Why not a win-win for everyone?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because everybody is not equally smart, kind, hard working, or lucky.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;Are you unwilling to admit that there is always a  better way, a better idea than
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;the one you currently possess?
</EM><BR>
<P>I am willing to admit that like every other human invention the free market is not perfect.
<BR>
<P>Without a doubt the best system is one where everybody simply does exactly what I tell
<BR>
them to do, however for some that reason I can't imagine I've found other people are
<BR>
somewhat less enthusiastic with the idea.
<BR>
<P>The second best system would be run by somebody who always knew what the right
<BR>
thing to do was, had the moral courage to actually do it, and had the leadership
<BR>
qualities to convince others to do it too. Unfortunately such moral paragons are a
<BR>
little hard to find.
<BR>
<P>The Free Market I'm afraid is a distant third.
<BR>
<P><EM>        &gt;I'd prefer that everyone wins.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd prefer it if gravity was a repulsive force not attractive, but wishing does not make it so.
