<P>
You are quite right. There are contradictory predictions that people will
<BR>
start walking a lot more, interacting with local people, getting &quot;back to
<BR>
nature&quot; (whatever that means).
<BR>
<P>I think these two things merge well. I see people using advanced comms to
<BR>
stop having to interact directly with people they don't want to, and to stop
<BR>
losing time to pointless stuff (like walking around a supermarket, or
<BR>
commuting to work; like not having to put up with office managers).
<BR>
<P>But we still need human contact, we just become freer to choose who that
<BR>
contact is with. For instance, I telework to the US, so no commuting. But I
<BR>
walk to the local shops (20 minute round trip) at the drop of a hat; for
<BR>
milk or a loaf of bread. I often do my work in the local cafes - it's nice
<BR>
because there are people around, like at work, but they don't ask me if I
<BR>
can fix up their excel spreadsheet; and there's good music instead of some
<BR>
hideous baby-boomers golden oldies classic crap radio station, and when my
<BR>
latte is empty it gets replaced. Much of my professional help, like lawyers
<BR>
and accountants, comes from people in walking distance. I know a lot of
<BR>
local people in businesses in the main street; I very rarely go into the
<BR>
heart of Melbourne. I don't run a car anymore.
<BR>
<P>I'm not saying I'm indicative of the norm; for instance, I don't run a car
<BR>
anymore. But I think the way I'm making choices will become more popular;
<BR>
it's the time of &quot;lifestyle&quot;. People choosing &quot;lifestyle&quot; (another one of
<BR>
those weird ill defined words) over corporate slavery. And this will mean
<BR>
optimizing out stuff that is dreary and avoidable (like commuting), and
<BR>
replacing it with &quot;lifestyle&quot; stuff.
<BR>
<P>I'm still waiting for them crazy robots, however. I'm not sure why robotics
<BR>
people are so hung up on making human-equivalent brains; there's plenty
<BR>
around now, implemented in wetware. Just give us good, high bandwidth,
<BR>
immersive remote controls. I'm there!
<BR>
<P>For instance, I'd love to be able to rent a robot body for the day from a US
<BR>
robot-rental dealer (robo-hurtz), and be able to turn up to my US clients
<BR>
and actually interact with them, whilst tucked in my little hidey-hole in
<BR>
Melbourne. I'd pay money for that.

<P><P>After spending countless hours; years?  on chat networks, I have seen a
<BR>
predictable counter reaction to immersion, in that people after a time begin
<BR>
to crave RL enriched experience.
