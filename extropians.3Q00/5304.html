<P><EM>&gt; I don't think you're really choosing between happiness and productivity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here, since ostensibly, what you hope to buy with your productivity is long

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the question is, do you think one should trade short term happiness for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long term happiness?  The answer is yes.
</EM><BR>
<P>I should have qualified the claim: the tradeoff is between happiness
<BR>
today and productivity today.  Productivity today yields happiness
<BR>
tomorrow, of course.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, I KNEW that; knowing that doesn't settle the matter.
<BR>
<P>If my chances of survival are independent of what I do, then it seems I
<BR>
should focus on happiness today.
<BR>
<P>But if my chances of survival depend a lot on my productivity today,
<BR>
as it well might, since very few people seem to be working on
<BR>
technology that will keep me alive, then it seems I should focus on
<BR>
productivity today, even at a trade off for happiness today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm curious to hear how you're evaluating each career's ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substantially increase your survivability.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, of the career choices I can think of that are available to me,
<BR>
I'd say that the most likely to increase my survival (and, perhaps,
<BR>
long term happiness,) is work in biomedical engineering; either by
<BR>
doing actual research or going into biomedical engineering patent law
<BR>
and reinvesting much of my earnings.  Next is probably computer
<BR>
science/programming.  Philosophy ranks dead last.  :)
<BR>
<P>What to do... what to do...
<BR>
<P>Disclaimer: I'm only making a claim about what seems likely to
<BR>
increase MY OWN survivability and ultimate happiness; your preferences
<BR>
and skill set may vary substantially from mine and yield an entirely
<BR>
different list.  Your mileage may vary.
