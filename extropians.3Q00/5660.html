<EM>&gt; &gt; You'd need the most talented leadership in the entire world, because the entire

<EM>&gt; &gt; intelligent and conscientious brains.

<EM>&gt; Amen.  You first need to convince a sufficient number of people that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your diagnosis of the most important thing really is the most important
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the only hope and that your design is fundamentally sound.  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not a trivial task and no, not all people of sufficient caliber to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; useful to the work will get it from the first.

<P>Yes, I used to think that way.  I can remember when I used to think that way. 
<BR>
I can remember when the possibility of losing even one person was so horrible
<BR>
that it overrode everything else in the mental landscape.  But we don't need
<BR>
every single person of sufficient caliber.  Let's say that the raw info will
<BR>
get 80% of the PoSCs, and nicey-nice phrasing will get 85%.  Is the difference
<BR>
really all that significant?  Is it worth a 300% increase in authorial time
<BR>
expenditure?
