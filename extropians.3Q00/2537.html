<EM>&gt; Optionally, we hardcode ourselves into the information-- in fact, we make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;smartness&quot; fundamental to the information.  Every thought that comes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out of your brain becomes an extension of you, as opposed to an anonymous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dust mote in the cyclone.  The system that is the &quot;creator&quot; becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inextricably linked to the data that is the &quot;created.&quot;  Widespread
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; empowerment of ideas in the frictionless matricies of the future give you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exposure to limitless designer ideas, with a direct positive feedback loop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the &quot;creator&quot; based upon your successful use of the &quot;created.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is an attractive image, and I can understand your desire to see
<BR>
a world which allows this sort of flexibility and innovation.  It is
<BR>
necessary to look more closely at the details, though.  Just thinking
<BR>
of generic &quot;information&quot;, smart or dumb, paints the picture with two
<BR>
broad a brush.
<BR>
<P>Some kinds of information can reasonably be controlled, and others cannot.
<BR>
That's the nature of reality.  Any model of the future which rejects this
<BR>
fact is going to miss its mark.
<BR>
<P>Music, paintings, videos, and similar recorded works cannot reasonably
<BR>
be controlled.  They are the same every time, and it is too easy to
<BR>
record them and digitize them and propagate them.  This is the point
<BR>
John Gilmore was making, that the RIAA and MPAA and the various other
<BR>
associations are fighting against nature, rather than with it.
<BR>
<P>Better targets for control are information services.  If the information
<BR>
you provide is dynamic, up to date, flexible and adapted to the current
<BR>
situation, then you can more reasonably expect to &quot;own&quot; the service
<BR>
of providing that information.
<BR>
<P>There has been considerable work on models in which agents interact and
<BR>
trade with one another in a model very much like your &quot;frictionless
<BR>
matrices of the future&quot;.  Agoric computing, developed by Drexler and
<BR>
Miller, envisions a net full of software agents which sell services to
<BR>
one another, with full control over whom they choose to interact with
<BR>
(see <A HREF="http://www.agorics.com/agoricpapers.html">http://www.agorics.com/agoricpapers.html</A>).  Take a look at the
<BR>
abstract from the first paper:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper examines markets as a model for computation and proposes a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;framework-agoric systems-for applying the power of market mechanisms
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the software domain. It then explores the consequences of this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model at a variety of levels. Initial market strategies are outlined
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which, if used by objects locally, lead to distributed resource
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allocation algorithms that encourage adaptive modification based on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local knowledge. If used as the basis for large, distributed systems,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open to the human market, agoric systems can serve as a software
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publishing and distribution marketplace providing strong incentives for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the development of reusable software components. It is argued that such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a system should give rise to increasingly intelligent behavior as an
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emergent property of interactions among software entities and people.
<BR>
<P>This sounds a lot like your picture of intelligent data.  When a
<BR>
data service is used, the author gets paid.  This creates incentives
<BR>
for ever more innovation and improvement in information engineering.
<BR>
Mark Miller's work on the E programming language (www.erights.org) is
<BR>
designed to facilitate such a world.  Likewise the MojoNation effort
<BR>
(www.mojonation.net) has concepts which are similar.
<BR>
<P>The key to these models is that they are careful to distinguish between
<BR>
what reasonably can be controlled, and what can't.  They don't pretend
<BR>
that you can give information to someone else and then control what
<BR>
they do with it.  Nevertheless they seem to suggest that many of the
<BR>
properties you attribute to smart information will be possible even in
<BR>
a world where IP is not owned.
