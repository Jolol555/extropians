</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You are, of course, factually incorrect, but we've already run those debates.
</EM><BR>
<P>Correction, I *could* be incorrect. As a matter of fact, the above slogan 
<BR>
can be interpreted in at least two different ways, that's the beauty of it. 
<BR>
It can either mean extinction or that mankind moves beyond its highly 
<BR>
limited biological form and uploads (or whatever); &quot;no *flesh* shall be 
<BR>
spared&quot;. Same with the slogan &quot;technology will set you free&quot;; it can be 
<BR>
interpreted cynically, as a variation on &quot;arbeit macht frei&quot;, or 
<BR>
optimistically, meaning actual liberation by means of technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, something like the above, maybe in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; combination with Vinge's famous quote, a skull and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; some 0110101001/CgACTCACTATAg stuff might make a nice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; t-shirt...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ditch the skull.  Primates, including us, have built-in fear reactions to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;skulls, because it's generally a bad idea to hang around places where others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of your species have died - whatever killed them might still be around and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;able to hurt you.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly, and that's what makes it such a potent symbol. There is IMO no 
<BR>
more appropriate symbol for the end of the human (biological) era than the 
<BR>
good old skull. It basically says: &quot;one way or the other, biology is finished&quot;.
<BR>
The digital sequence leaves little doubt as to who, or rather *what*, will 
<BR>
be its successor. The ones and zeros could be projected over the skull, for 
<BR>
example, and/or form the background. A version with just the DNA sequences 
<BR>
and the 0/1 would also be nice, as a more subtle approach, but would IMO 
<BR>
also be less powerful. It *would* be quite suitable for a website, though, 
<BR>
as a &quot;flowing&quot; animation (a la Matrix). Out of this flowing background you 
<BR>
can then make your actual logo and/or text slowly materialize. As a matter 
<BR>
of fact, I think I'll use this on my own website one of these days...One 
<BR>
slick animation can have a greater impact on us emotional, visually 
<BR>
oriented humans than a thousand words, after all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Besides which, a standard Galactic Shining Human Figure transcendence-shot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;does a better job of conveying the theory.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, Age of Aquarius...la, la! Well, 
<BR>
I think that we agreed that 50% either way is the most reasonable 
<BR>
compromise, so both the grim skull and the shiny happy starman are 
<BR>
legitimate symbols. Whatever you prefer. Selling t-shirts might be a good 
<BR>
idea, though.
