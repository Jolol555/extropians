Fun results! The methodological problems of studying love are of
<BR>
course enormous, so one should take them with a grain of salt (even if
<BR>
the London group people are *good*).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;          These love doctors believe the lovey-dovey instinct is all in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     brain the medial insula, the anterior cingulate, the striatum and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     prefrontal cortex to be exact.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, the insula and cingulate are not unexpected. Insula seems to be
<BR>
very much about our bodily &quot;feelgood&quot; or &quot;feelbad&quot; feelings, and the
<BR>
cingulate is the link between the frontal lobe thinking and the limbic
<BR>
emotions. Striatum and prefrontal cortex is more unexpected, that is
<BR>
usually more action-oriented (the planning system, what to do in this
<BR>
context etc). Maybe it is an artefact. Or maybe they are thinking
<BR>
about what to do when they meet the loved one.

<P><EM>&gt; Interesting research. Of course, this kind of thing should be done on a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *much* larger scale; that would really help us to understand the brain. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, maybe it's time for us rational transhumanist types to get less 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; romantic about love, and see it for what it really is; a dangerous, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-individualistic, anti-intellectual addiction which (presumably) only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; serves the &quot;interests&quot; of &quot;blind, selfish genes&quot;, not your own enlightened 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-interest. Being in love is about as &quot;transhuman&quot; as smoking crack. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;But if feels so good&quot;...Yeah, sure it does, JUNKIE! To quote from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; article:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &quot;These [&quot;love&quot;] parts of the brain are also the parts which are active in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     euphoric states generated by exogenous substances such as cocaine,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     noted research partner Dr. Zeki. &quot;Romantic love is to for many people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     at any rate, intoxicating.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's obviously nothing wrong with &quot;feeling intoxicated/euphoric&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (feeling good is more or less the interim meaning of life, after all), but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such states should only be generated in a highly controlled, emotionally 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; autonomous mental structure. Anyway, here's the article...
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I think the same systems get activated in me when I write
<BR>
creative texts or do research - the problem isn't the euphoria, but
<BR>
the framework. Continous control might not be the best framework
<BR>
paradigm, another possibility could be that you shape your emotional
<BR>
system during metaprogramming sessions to value suitable things or
<BR>
channel its energy in the right directions - the system is tuned to
<BR>
behave right natrually rather than requiring constant supervision.
