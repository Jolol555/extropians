<P>
Note: This is my last message. I understand and respect that you don't want to hear from me anymore, but I did want to post this last reply.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<BR>
<P>I am sorry if my last post has been upsetting to all of you. However, 
<BR>
if you carefully read what I said in the part that triggered your 
<BR>
reactions, it was the following:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I know from personal research that several extropians or transhumanists 
<BR>
are guilty of sexually abusing children (Keith Henson, for example), 
<BR>
and I recently came across a persistent rumor that the same is true 
<BR>
of Max More (incidentally a friend of Henson?) as well.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In other words, I said I had come across a verbal accusation from a trusted source. I openly admit that I do not at this point have legal evidence, but have strong enough indications to make me suspicious or curious. 
<BR>
<P>When I bring this up here, I get attacked, pushed into weird pseudo-philosophical corners and threatened with all kinds of legal and semi-legal attacks. 
<BR>
One poster in fact goes as far as using the word &quot;lynch&quot;. All I hear from Mr More is I am a liar and he wants to sue me. Others want to remove the whole thread from the archive, thereby censoring free speech. 
<BR>
<P>The whole outrage is not directed at the despicable action I wonder about, but against my wondering in public. And then you are surprised that I do not wish to reveal my identity at this point?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It's not that I don't agree that there could have possibly been a better way to sort this out. I simply did not foresee the fury I created, and for this I am sorry. 
<BR>
<P>If the rumor is false, and if Mr More is not in support of such behavior, all that is necessary is a clear statement to that effect, not retaliation for an imagined wrong. All this excitement only makes me wonder...
<BR>
