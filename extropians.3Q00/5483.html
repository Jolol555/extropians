Regarding guns.....
<BR>
<P>Why shouldn't the lawmakers who passed the &quot;safe storage laws...or the gun 
<BR>
free school zone law...be held responsible?....cigarette manufactures are 
<BR>
held responsible for what OTHER PEOPLE DO...of their own free will.
<BR>
<P>Bar owners are held responsible for what OTHE PEOPLE DO of their own free 
<BR>
will.
<BR>
<P>Why shouldn't  legislators be held responsible for the unintended 
<BR>
consequences of what they FORCE PEOPLE  to do?

<EM>&gt;      FROM MOUNTAIN MEDIA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE DATED SEPT. 24, 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      THE LIBERTARIAN, By Vin Suprynowicz
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      Shouldn't we repeal the gun laws ... if it'll save a single child?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      Jessica Lynne Carpenter is 14 years old. She knows how to shoot; her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  father taught her. And there were adequate firearms to deal with the crisis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that arose in the Carpenter home in Merced, Calif. -- a San Joaquin Valley
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  farming community 130 miles southeast of San Francisco -- when 27-year-old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Jonathon David Bruce came calling on Wednesday morning, Aug. 23.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    There was just one problem. Under the new &quot;safe storage&quot; laws being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enacted in California and elsewhere, parents can be held criminally liable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  unless they lock up their guns when their children are home alone ... so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that's just what law-abiding parents John and Tephanie Carpenter had done.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Some of Jessica's siblings -- Anna, 13; Vanessa, 11; Ashley, 9; and John
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  William, 7 -- were still in their bedrooms when Bruce broke into the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  farmhouse shortly after 9 a.m.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Bruce, who was armed with a pitchfork -- but to whom police remain unable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to attribute any motive -- had apparently cut the phone lines. So when he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  forced his way into the house and began stabbing the younger children in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  their beds, Jessica's attempts to dial 9-1-1 didn't do much good. Next, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sensible girl ran for where the family guns were stored. But they were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  locked up tight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &quot;When the 14-year-old girl ran to a nearby house to escape the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  pitchfork-wielding man attacking her siblings,&quot; writes Kimi Yoshino of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Fresno Bee, &quot;she didn't ask her neighbor to call 9-1-1. She begged him to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  grab his rifle and 'take care of this guy.' &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    He didn't. Jessica ended up on the phone.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    By the time Merced County sheriff's deputies arrived at the home,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  7-year-old John William and 9-year-old Ashley Danielle were dead. Ashley
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  had apparently hung onto her assailant's leg long enough for her older
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sisters to escape. Thirteen-year-old Anna was wounded but survived.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Once the deputies arrived, Bruce rushed them with his bloody pitchfork.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  So they shot him dead. They shot him more than a dozen times. With their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  guns.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Get it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The following Friday, the children's great-uncle, the Rev. John Hilton,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  told reporters: &quot;If only (Jessica) had a gun available to her, she could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have stopped the whole thing. If she had been properly armed, she could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have stopped him in his tracks.&quot; Maybe John William and Ashley would still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be alive, Jessica's uncle said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;Unfortunately, 17 states now have these so-called safe storage laws,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  replies Yale Law School Senior Research Scholar Dr. John Lott -- author of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the book &quot;More Guns, Less Crime.&quot; &quot;The problem is, you see no decrease in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  either juvenile accidental gun deaths or suicides when such laws are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  enacted, but you do see an increase in crime rates.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Such laws are based on the notion that young children often &quot;find daddy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  gun&quot; and accidentally shoot each other. But in fact only five American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  children under the age of 10 died of accidents involving handguns in 1997,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Lott reports. &quot;People get the impression that kids under 10 are killing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  each other. In fact this is very rare: three to four per year.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The typical shooter in an accidental child gun death is a male in his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  late teens or 20s, who, statistically, is probably a drug addict or an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  alcoholic and has already been charged with multiple crimes, Lott reports.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;These are the data that correlate. Are these the kind of people who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  going to obey one more law?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    So why doesn't the national press report what happens when a victim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  disarmament (&quot;gun control&quot;) law costs the lives of innocent children in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  place like Merced?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;In the school shooting in Pearl, Miss.,&quot; Dr. Lott replies, &quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  assistant principal had formerly carried a gun to school. When the 1995
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (&quot;Gun-Free School Zones&quot;) law passed, he took to locking his gun in his car
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and parking it at least a quarter-mile away from the school, in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  obey the law. When that shooting incident started he ran to his car,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  unlocked it, got his gun, ran back, disarmed the shooter and held him on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the ground for five minutes until the police arrived.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;There were more than 700 newspaper stories catalogued on that incident.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Only 19 mentioned the assistant principal in any way, and only nine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  mentioned that he had a gun.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The press covers only the bad side of gun use, and only the potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  benefits of victim disarmament laws -- never their costs. &quot;Basically all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the current federal proposals fall into this category -- trigger locks,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  waiting periods,&quot; Lott said. &quot;There's not one academic study that shows any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  reduction in crime from measures like these. But there are good studies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that show the opposite. Even with short waiting periods, crime goes up. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have women being stalked, and they can't go quickly and get a gun due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the waiting periods, so they get assaulted or they get killed.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The United States has among the world's lowest &quot;hot&quot; burglary rates --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  burglaries committed while people are in the building -- at 13 percent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  compared to &quot;gun-free&quot; Britain's rate, which is now up to 59 percent, Lott
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  reports. &quot;If you survey burglars, American burglars spend at least twice as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  long casing a joint before they break in. ... The number one reason they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  give for taking so much time is: They're afraid of getting shot.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The way Jonathon David Bruce, of Merced, Calif., might once have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  afraid of getting shot ... before 17 states enacted laws requiring American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  parents to leave their kids disarmed while they're away from home.
