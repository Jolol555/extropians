David Lubkin writes, quoting Hal:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;If you're prepared to kill in response to robberies and other violent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;crimes against yourself (as I believe Mike and others advocate) then you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;must accept that there is a 99% chance that you are NOT defending your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;life, you are rather applying the death penalty to a sub-lethal crime.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here's where you stray.  Being prepared to kill does not equate with killing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just as most violent crimes do not lead to murder, most uses of guns in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-defense also do not lead to homicide.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's true, but still, from the philosophical perspective, you should
<BR>
only pull the gun if you believe shooting is justified, right?  That seems
<BR>
to be what many gun owners have said in this discussion.  You can't
<BR>
rely on the hope that you won't have to shoot, that statistically you
<BR>
can probably just scare them.  Most people have said that it is not wise
<BR>
to rely on this hope as a source of comfort.  You have to face squarely
<BR>
the fact that you should not pull a gun unless you are prepared to use it.
<BR>
<P>Given that, if you advocate using a gun to stop robbery, rape and other
<BR>
sub-lethal crimes, philosophically you have to say that it is justified
<BR>
to kill in order to stop such crimes.  The statistics for how seldom
<BR>
those crimes escalate to murder just sharpen this point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No one is advocating that if you see someone committing a crime, you pull out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your pistol and blow them away, unless it is the only means of saving a life.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What is being argued is:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - You are entitled to defend yourself against violent attack.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - We applaud people who are willing to defend others against violence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Guns can be an effective means of defense, if one is trained.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - There are alternatives to guns, like not being there in the first place, or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking someone out of it.  They may be effective but are not guaranteed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - A necessary part of carrying a gun or knife is an honest acknowledgement that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this may result in taking a life.  Deal with this before you carry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - If you are adequately prepared, whether use of a gun in self-defense does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take a life depends on the criminal's subsequent actions.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would emphasize your 2nd-to-last point more strongly: acknowledge that
<BR>
you will be forced to threaten to take a life that does not deserve to be
<BR>
lost.  We don't give robbers the death penalty.  It is a disproportionate
<BR>
punishment (those who disagree are invited to respond to my other message
<BR>
raising this point).
