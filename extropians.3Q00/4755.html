<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; In other words, there is no viewpoint that is being offered

<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; here by QueenMUSE, just word games and posturing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Aha... art!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cute, but then you trivialize art.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's sort of what I'm doing.
<BR>
<P>Or rather: showing that art likes to hide in odd places and tends to crawl
<BR>
away under observation.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;If art is only &quot;word games and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; posturing,&quot; then it takes no great skill and any charlatan is an artist.
</EM><BR>
<P>I've often thought that much art is akin to illusion: it is evocative of
<BR>
something intangible.  The realistic approach to a concept or object
<BR>
involves our approaching it on a functional level, i.e:  What does this do?
<BR>
How can it help me?  How can I interact with it?  What information does it
<BR>
provide?
<BR>
<P>You rarely look at a painting in this manner, unless you are concerned that
<BR>
the frame might fall on you.
<BR>
<P><P>I rarely bother to engage people who attack art as being functionally
<BR>
useless-- mostly because I agree that they are basically right... except
<BR>
insofar as that function is to attack/uplift the realm of the mind.
<BR>
<P>Much of art lives in this realm of the mind, and as such, much of art is
<BR>
necessarily subjective.  It is neither possible nor desirable to create
<BR>
absolute classifications for what does and does not qualify as art.  One
<BR>
person's art is another's toilet.
<BR>
<P>I would never say that someone was 'wrong' to call something 'art,' simply
<BR>
because I do not think that one can be mistaken.  In this, all things are
<BR>
potentially art.  (And &quot;not&quot;art)
<BR>
<P>Art happens somewhere in the space between the object and the mind of the
<BR>
observer.  We do not call something -great- art because -many- people call
<BR>
it art, but rather that -discerning- people call it art.  In fact, it is
<BR>
anticipated that great art is necessarily challenging and is only
<BR>
occassionally embraced by the majority.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I don't really think that &quot;great art&quot; and &quot;art&quot; are really the
<BR>
same type of animal at all.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I don't know what art is anymore.
<BR>
<P>Actually, I thought I knew, but something dribbled out, and that something
<BR>
was the knowing.
<BR>
<P><P>It is anticipated that not all people are equipped with, or desire to be
<BR>
equipped with, the interface necessary to be impacted by and discerning of,
<BR>
art.  I doubt such an interface confers any practical advantage, except in
<BR>
briefly barely slightly lightly passing.
<BR>
<P>For this reason, I suspect many will not/never concern themselves with art
<BR>
and I can't objectively see any reason why this is a &quot;bad thing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Conversely, possession of such an interface does allow one to participate
<BR>
with reality on a different level, with subsequent subjective
<BR>
blessings/curses.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Also, there's no reason to talk about Extropian or transhumanist art.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not really sure what &quot;transhuman&quot; art is, frankly.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Why would emotions run so high if it were only that?
</EM><BR>
<P>Who knows?  We seem to think it's important.
