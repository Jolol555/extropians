<EM>&gt; &gt; One of the more interesting short stories in SciFi writer, Larry Niven's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; collection is &quot;On A Foggy Night&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's one of the ones that came to mind; the other one is &quot;He walked

<P>The most haunting parallel world story I have ever encountered is
<BR>
Damon Knight's _What Rough Beast?_.  This was in an Ace paperback I once
<BR>
owned of _The Best From 'Fantasy and Science Fiction'_, Ninth Series,
<BR>
edited by Robert P. Mills (1959), which also contained the original
<BR>
short-story version of _Flowers for Algernon_.  I lent this volume to
<BR>
a friend long ago (in 1973, as I now recall), and had long forgotten
<BR>
it, but the contents of the Damon Knight story kept bubbling up to
<BR>
consciousness even though I couldn't remember its title or author.
<BR>
<P>Only the advent of the Web in my life (just three and a half years ago!)
<BR>
enabled me to restore this connection -- I spent a Saturday afternoon
<BR>
free-associating and brute-force-searching in the Contento index
<BR>
(<A HREF="http://www.best.com/~contento/">http://www.best.com/~contento/</A>), and re-acquired the title and
<BR>
name of the author.  After that, it was an easy matter to find
<BR>
the book itself at an on-line used book site (probably
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.abebooks.com">http://www.abebooks.com</A>).
<BR>
<P>_What Rough Beast?_ makes excellent Christmastime reading.
<BR>
<P>I had a similar &quot;mission&quot; to recover the author and title of another
<BR>
story I had read in a volume I checked out of my elementary-school
<BR>
library when I was in 5th or 6th grade.  That story had a memorable
<BR>
precursor of nanotechish ideas in it -- it was about a starship
<BR>
&quot;garage&quot; whose owner had to get the details about a seamless
<BR>
manufacturing technology (called in the story &quot;molecular
<BR>
spray&quot;) in order to complete a prestigious repair contract which
<BR>
the proprietor had won by claiming to have the technology in the
<BR>
first place.  This story turned out to be _Tools of the Trade_ by
<BR>
Raymond
<BR>
F. Jones, published in the anthology _Space, Space, Space_, edited
<BR>
by William Sloane (Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1953).  This volume also contains
<BR>
Alan E. Nourse's memorable _Nightmare Brother_, which fact I **did**
<BR>
remember (along with the title of the Nourse story), and which I
<BR>
was able to use as a key to help track the anthology containing
<BR>
the obscurer story I was interested in rediscovering.  The used copy of
<BR>
_Space, Space, Space_ I purchased on-line was, amusingly, also
<BR>
once the property of a public school library.
