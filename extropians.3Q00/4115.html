Daniel Ust has graciously contributed,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; In particular, I believe one should avoid just taking what one knows to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; true and reclassifying it as axiomatic.  For instance, my eye color, which I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see every time I look in the mirror is not, for me, an axiom.  Surely, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know it.  I know it's true -- in the context of my knowledge.  But it is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an axiom.  It doesn't underly all of my knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, would you consider &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; as true knowledge or as axiomatic?
<BR>
If &quot;reality = all that exists&quot; isn't axiomatic, but rather a universal truth,
<BR>
that's okay with me.
<BR>
I just think of it as a definition.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think Jason Joel Thompson meant something more than that.  Though I agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with you that reality is unitary, I think he meant that the unification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might only take place in the mind.  In other words, that collecting all real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things into &quot;reality&quot; is no more than a mental shorthand and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metaphysically reality -- all the real things -- might be separate and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unrelated.  I would take this to include stuff not perceived or known and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore not unified by any mind.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this conversation originated with Jason Joel Thompson contradicting
<BR>
Eliezer's statement:
<BR>
&quot;There is only one reality&quot; -- which disagreement I took for obstinance, because
<BR>
Eli's statement seems to me as self-evident as the statement that 2 + 2 = 4.
<BR>
I mean, of course someone could argue that 2 + 2 = 5 (for very large values of
<BR>
2). But to spend more than a few sentences voicing disagreement seems
<BR>
extravagant if not confrontational.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&quot;We participate, therefore we are.&quot;
