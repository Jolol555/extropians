Title
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lipophilic HMG-CoA
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reductase inhibitors increase myocardial stunning in dogs.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretreatment of dogs with simvastatin, a lipophilic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reductase inhibitor, increases myocardial contractile
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dysfunction during reperfusion after ischemia (stunning), with reduction of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This was thought to be a consequence of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;prevention of ubiquinone biosynthesis by the lipophilic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inhibitor in the myocardial cell. We examined whether other
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lipophilic HMG-CoA
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reductase inhibitors also influence myocardial stunning in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dogs. Vehicle, atorvastatin (2 mg/ kg/day), fluvastatin (4 mg/kg/day), or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cerivastatin (40 microg/kg/ day) was orally administered for 3 weeks.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrophilic pravastatin (4 mg/kg/day) also was given. After 3 weeks,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were subjected to 15-min left anterior
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 2-h reperfusion. Myocardial
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;segment function was determined by sonomicrometry. Tissue levels of ATP were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;determined in 2-h reperfused hearts. All inhibitors significantly decreased
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;serum cholesterol level. The three lipophilic inhibitors
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;resulted in a worsening of segment function in the reperfused myocardium, as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;compared with the vehicle group. The levels of ATP in the atorvastatin,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fluvastatin, and cerivastatin groups were significantly lower than that in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the vehicle group. These results confirm that lipophilic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors enhance
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;myocardial stunning in association with ATP reduction after ischemia and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reperfusion.
