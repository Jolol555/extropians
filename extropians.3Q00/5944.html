<EM> &gt; Researchers can also be friends, can't they?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, some primate researchers have probably befriended their
<BR>
charges. However, that's not an absolute prerequisite. And it kinda
<BR>
requires an AI you can relate to.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; AI s (not yet SIs) would want to be friendly to each other, because if they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; weren't they'd kill each other (as you've already pointed out). As Homo sapiens
</EM><BR>
<P>But of course they will. The first AI which has nucleated in the
<BR>
network will copy (sexually) mutated copies of itself all over the
<BR>
place in a wormlike fashion. Because the copy process is much faster
<BR>
than adding new nodes (even if you have nanotechnology) you have
<BR>
instant resource scarcity and hence competition for limited
<BR>
resources. Those individua with lesser fitness will have to go to the
<BR>
great bit bucket in the sky.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; evolve into Robo sapiens (or transhumans), they'd choose their friends
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligently, right? So, why would you want to be friends with an emerging AI
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; if it wasn't friendly? (&quot;Kill it before it multiplies.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I would advise against that, if a few decades from now you
<BR>
see the global networks and attached external machinery suddenly start
<BR>
acting in a very strange fashion (i.e. it's not a just another Net
<BR>
worm). Without concerted actions you can't do anything decisive, and
<BR>
by local pinpricks you only annoy the things, and make *you* look
<BR>
unfriendly.
