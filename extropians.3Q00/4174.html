<BR>
<EM>&gt; I snipped some stuff here where Techno talks about the philosophy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; representationalism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Selective quoting.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not familiar with this 'philosophy,' but I can tell already that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't what I'm talking about, although at first glance it appear
</EM><BR>
remarkably
<BR>
<EM>&gt; similar.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; In fact, the position I hold is one I believe is relatively uncontested--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I look at an object, I receive signals bounced off of it's surface
</EM><BR>
that
<BR>
<EM>&gt; reveal it's properties.  This is not a philosophy, it is a verifiable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; observation.
</EM><BR>
<P>How does one verify this operation?  Since one cannot, say, step outside
<BR>
one's awareness and &quot;see&quot; the object and the sense systems working and all
<BR>
of the things you talk about are things learn from sense perception and
<BR>
inferences from them.  People discovered, originally, the light reflecting
<BR>
properties of surfaces and about light by observation -- i.e., by sense
<BR>
perception -- and by trying to make sense of sense perception.  (No pun
<BR>
intended.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The philosophy arises from the conclusions that we may choose to make
</EM><BR>
about
<BR>
<EM>&gt; this state of affairs.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree.  A valid and true philosophy is neither a taste nor an
<BR>
intellectual bauble.  The conclusions should match reality.  If not, I
<BR>
submit, it's not a valid and true philosophy.  That said, I do not mean that
<BR>
one must always and ever be correct everywhere, but the general tone of it
<BR>
should be true and valid and one should, in order to keep it going in the
<BR>
direction of being ever more true and valid correct errors.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Another flaw with representationalism is that once things are pushed
</EM><BR>
back
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the representations, there is no need of the external object.  In fact,
</EM><BR>
it
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one cannot be aware of the external world and can only be aware of
</EM><BR>
images
<BR>
<EM>&gt; in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the mental theater, how can one be sure there is an external world at
</EM><BR>
all?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; One can't if representationalism is granted as true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why is this a flaw?
</EM><BR>
<P>It's a flaw for two reasons.  One is that it holds a model of consciousness
<BR>
that is wrong, that is that in order for awareness to be truthful --
<BR>
faithful to its objects -- it must not in any way be relative or contextual.
<BR>
This is nothing less than a claim that consciousness be a perfect mirror.
<BR>
Some -- George Berkeley is an example of this; see his _Three Dialogues
<BR>
Between Hylas and Philonous_ -- go so far as to claim that since an object
<BR>
which is far away looks smaller than when it's near, this casts the senses
<BR>
into doubt.  After all, the object does not change size, just our perception
<BR>
of it.  This particular example is nothing less than a claim that
<BR>
consciousness should not obey the laws of perspective and optics.  (Or as
<BR>
Rand would put it, you can't see because you have eyes.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I could go on.  Alien beings may perceive 'reality' in a totally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; fashion from us.  What you call an orange pen, they may describe in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; radically different terms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree, but this does not invalidate perception -- ours or theirs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think it 'invalidates' perception either.  It simply is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illustration of its inherent limitations.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that it's an example of limitations, but all things and activities
<BR>
are limited.  You can, e.g., only think so many thoughts, have some many
<BR>
imaginings, etc. in a given time.  To be is to be limited.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; colorblind person still perceives the same reality as me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Except the reality of color.
</EM><BR>
<P>That was the point of my example.  I don't hear really high pitched and
<BR>
really low picthed sounds.  They still exist.  I can be aware of them
<BR>
indirectly -- by inference from what I am directly aware of.  This is no
<BR>
different from being aware of the wind by seeing it shake the branches of a
<BR>
tree outside my window.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  She is missing an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aspect of it that I can experience.  Yet given enough information, she
</EM><BR>
can
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; come to see color exists though for her it will never be directly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perceived.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't quite understand this.  What sort of information are you talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if she's industrious enough, she could get equipment that detects,
<BR>
e.g., different wavelengths of light.  (This is not exactly how human
<BR>
perceive color, but it's a start.)  She could then see that two things that
<BR>
look equally gray to her, in fact, have other properties that distinguish
<BR>
them in terms of light.  (Doing this, she might also discover polarization,
<BR>
which humans can not perceive directly, BUT bees can.  How do we know?
<BR>
Researchers polarize light, then train bees to find food only where the
<BR>
light reflected is polarized a certain way.)
<BR>
<P>(I perhaps shouldn't use the feminine pronoun here, since from what I've
<BR>
read colorblind people are all males.  This is also true of my experience.
<BR>
I've never met a colorblind female human.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; It will be akin to me using an infrared camera.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, and when you use and infrared camera, you're -not- seeing infrared.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The camera is taking infrared signals and interpreting them into visible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was not arguing otherwise here.  Reread my comments.  I would, however,
<BR>
disagree with &quot;interpreting,&quot; but that's a minor quibble of style.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; What you are doing here is setting up the notion that perceptions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; false
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and models that abstract from them are true.  But the models are built
</EM><BR>
up
<BR>
<EM>&gt; on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perceptions.  So, if the former are wrong, so are the latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not exactly saying that perceptions are false... simply that
</EM><BR>
perceptions
<BR>
<EM>&gt; are limited.
</EM><BR>
<P>See above.  Again, all things are limited.  Superintelleginces and
<BR>
posthumans will suffer the same thing: limitation.  The limitations will be
<BR>
different, but there will always be a set of limits, most of which are not
<BR>
known beforehand.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Awareness is always limited, but this does not mean it is not aware of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; reality.  A young child might be aware that it's a sunny day without
</EM><BR>
being
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; aware of how the sun produces energy, how far away it is, what drives
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; weather, and how her sensory systems work.  You appear to be setting up
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; false dichotomy from either knowing everything or knowing nothing.  If
</EM><BR>
so,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; how can you know your senses are limited?  Or that we are barely aware?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, I am trying to topple a false dichotomy- one absolute reality
</EM><BR>
vs.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; nothing is real.  To be clear, I don't think we know nothing!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm happy to hear this.  However, I think the false choice is &quot;perfect
<BR>
knowledge vs. no knowledge.&quot;  Skeptics generally attack sense perception
<BR>
because it is not perfect and because it is limited.  However, this is set
<BR>
expectations too high -- holding real beings to divine (impossible)
<BR>
standards.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at an interesting point in the journey.  Our monkey brains are starting to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run into some problems, that much is certain-- our classical understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of reality is being challenged by the increasingly abstract interactions
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; sub-atomic particles and quantum mechanics.  We've been equipped with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tools to understand reality on a particular level, and we've really done a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great job with what we have.  But our sensory mode of existence can be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handicap, insofar as we persist in intepreting events in the context of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; physical universe.
</EM><BR>
<P>A lot of the stuff you hint at hear has been debating since the Ancient
<BR>
Greeks.  Not much of this is new.  Perhaps the new part is that a lot more
<BR>
people are involved in the discussion.  The ideas, however, are mostly
<BR>
rehashes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A child on a sunny day is receiving information about her environment.
</EM><BR>
That
<BR>
<EM>&gt; information is not the environment.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, but the environment and the child interacting with it cause the
<BR>
information -- and not in some spooky, New Age fashion.  Instead, her
<BR>
sensory systems react to changing signals from her surroundings.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let us suppose that there -is- an external reality out there.  That
</EM><BR>
reality
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is sending the child a signal.  The child's mind interprets that data and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forms a lattice of sensations-- a group of mental constructs that allow
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; child to navigate the information.  It is her interface with reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To repeat: her mind/computer is interpreting data and creating a mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world that acts as her interface to reality.  That mental world is not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reality itself, but rather a very useful representation of a particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slice of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree with some of this.  At the level of sense perception, there is no
<BR>
real interpretation.  The process is automatic.  I see a tree outside my
<BR>
window.  No interpretation.  I just see it.  It's when I make further
<BR>
assumptions that interpretation comes in.  For example, the bark on the
<BR>
right side is a lot darker than the left.  That's because it's in shadow.  I
<BR>
could be fooled into believing this is so if someone paints the tree.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
