<P>&lt;&lt; The current spike in prices is not due to the suppliers, but due to the
<BR>
&nbsp;increases in taxation and environmental mandates adding to the cost of fuel.
<BR>
&nbsp;Here in the US, most all the spike in the last year is a result of the
<BR>
&nbsp;introduction of new rules by the EPA regarding additives and processes for
<BR>
&nbsp;refineries. The fact that production has increased by 2 million barrels a day
<BR>
&nbsp;over the last four months with no change in prices indicates that its not a
<BR>
&nbsp;matter of supply, unless this is a result of some european countries
<BR>
&nbsp;deactivating nuclear plants, with the electric demand being satisfied by new
<BR>
&nbsp;fossil fuel burning plants. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
Not true. What OPEC does officially is not how it operates unofficially, 
<BR>
which is closer to the truth. Don't blame taxes and environmental eddicts. 
<BR>
Blame oil company mannipulation (supposed shifts to produce heating oil) and 
<BR>
our pals in the middle east charging all the market an bear. We need to 
<BR>
finally leave reliance on muddle eastern crude to the rest of the world and 
<BR>
focus on non-opec, non-petroleum sources for transportation and heating 
<BR>
supplies.
