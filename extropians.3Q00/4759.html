</EM><BR>
<P>Yup.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I felt that Chaitin's larger point was that axioms have a certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information content, and they simply can't prove theorems that have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; larger information content.  As he put it, with five pounds of axioms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can't prove a ten pound theorem.  This suggests that mathematical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truth may be much more complex than we imagined.
</EM><BR>
<P>This isn't exactly a new revelation for those who have been paying
<BR>
careful attention to provability theory.  Tarski told us almost
<BR>
exactly like this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Prior to Godel it was suspected that with the right axioms you could prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everything that was true.  We now know this to be false.  Chaitin has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taken Godel's result and made it quantitative.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not as quantitative as he might wish it were.  He can't actually
<BR>
tell you how many pounds of axioms you've got, only that one set of
<BR>
axioms is formally equivalent to a subset of another stronger set of axioms.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm not sure that this has much relevance outside of mathematics (or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps meta-mathematics).  It challenges the fundamental axiomatic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approach of mathematics and logic which goes back to the ancient Greeks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However Chaitin's suggestion that mathematics should become more of an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering discipline has not been well received.  If mathematicians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had wanted to be engineers they wouldn't have gone into math.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not engineers, scientists.  Any scientist, for example, would have
<BR>
taken Goldbach's conjecture, Fermat's Theorem, etc. to be law years
<BR>
ago.  It's interesting to see how far we could get taking these
<BR>
computer experiments to be scientific experiments within the realm of
<BR>
math.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; We use the phrase &quot;mathematical certainty&quot; as the highest degree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of assurance possible.  Chaitin would challenge that by opening up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mathematics to areas where no proofs are possible.  But math without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proofs is arguably something different than math.
</EM><BR>
<P>Science, to be precise.  ;) It would be the science of math.  One
<BR>
might expect it to be a very fruitful field of research; we know that
<BR>
math as it is done today has yielded some important and, surprisingly,
<BR>
practical results that we can apply in other areas of science and in
<BR>
engineering.  While we would expect the science of math to make more
<BR>
mistakes than today's mathematicians make, we might also expect them
<BR>
to reach some of the more interesting conclusions a lot faster than
<BR>
conventional mathematicians would.  For example, if a scientist of
<BR>
math ran the Goldbach conjecture through a supercomputer and found no
<BR>
useful counterobjections, and then went on to formulate a few other
<BR>
interesting experiments based on that conjecture, he might reach some
<BR>
interesting/practical conclusions in math that would take years if not
<BR>
centuries for conventional mathematicians to prove.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Chaitin has some hand-waving about possible connections between Godel's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; results and the uncertainty principle, or between his discovery of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; essentially random nature of mathematics and the randomness in QM.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, the paradoxes of QM take on an entirely different hue when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considered in light of many-worlds interpretations, where there is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no randomness.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Interestingly, Chaitin's theories can take on a different role there;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Algorithmic Information Theory plays a key part in many-universe models
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that go beyond QM.  Wei Dai has a mailing list for exploring the notion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that all universes exist, and that the &quot;measure&quot; or contribution of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a universe is proportional to the algorithmic information content of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that universe, by Chaitin's measure (others have also developed similar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metrics).
</EM><BR>
<P>There's an obvious philosophical parallel between microstates and the
<BR>
truth values of unprovable sentences; it's a fairly natural way of
<BR>
speaking which mathematicians tend to fall into quite easily.
<BR>
Remember, for Chaitin, the &quot;bit&quot; is the truth value of an unprovable
<BR>
sentence; in thermodynamics under MWI, it's finding yourself in one
<BR>
world as opposed to another.
<BR>
<P>MWI advocates talk about the other possible worlds as if they really
<BR>
exist (and, I suspect, they just might).  Mathematicians, on the other
<BR>
hand, talk of spaces or worlds or universes in which Euclid's axioms
<BR>
hold and spaces/worlds/universes in which they don't, as if these
<BR>
things actually existed.  Chaitin would talk about worlds in which his
<BR>
equation E given parameters (n[1] ... n[m]) had a finite number of
<BR>
solutions, and worlds in which E(n[1] ... n[m]) had an infinite number
<BR>
of solutions.
<BR>
<P>It's a purely philosophical debate as to whether these mathematical
<BR>
worlds &quot;actually&quot; exist, whereas MWI has some results that it can
<BR>
test, but beyond that, the parallel is quite close.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is an interesting paradox here; you'd think a universe starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a certain information content could not generate anything which had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a larger information content (a la Chaitin's results).  However, I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think this is true; our own universe may have had almost zero information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content but it generated us.  My explanation is that to single out a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human being in the multiverse takes a huge amount of information, in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; form of its &quot;address&quot;.  The actual rule seems to be that the information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a subsystem is limited by the sum of the initial information in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe, plus the information needed to locate and specify the extent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the subregion.  I wonder what if any connections this might have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chaitin's limitations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I interpret Chaitin's results in the opposite way.  Just as
<BR>
entropy tends to increase as time goes on, that is, as you find
<BR>
yourself in one world after another, so are there MORE formally
<BR>
undecidable sentences as you start assuming Godel-sentences to be
<BR>
true.  More pounds of axioms have more information content, that is,
<BR>
more worlds which might turn out to be true given the axioms in
<BR>
question.  Settle one formally undecidable question and even more pop
<BR>
up; it's an unwinnable game of whack-a-mole.
