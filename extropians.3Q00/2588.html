<BR>
issues re nuclear power:
<BR>
<P>BNFL has paid out millions of pounds in compensation to its workers for a
<BR>
range of cancers, including leukemia, on a probability of just 20% that the
<BR>
cancers were caused by radiation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;TMI? Not one fatality. Chernobyl? A system purposely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overloaded with all safety systems turned off, as some sort of stupid
</EM><BR>
'test' 
<BR>
<P>As a reality check I suggest looking at the article found at:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.ornl.gov/ORNLReview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html">http://www.ornl.gov/ORNLReview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html</A>
<BR>
<P>entitled:
<BR>
<P>Coal consumption: Nuclear Resource or Danger? 
<BR>
<P>A few short excerpts:
<BR>
<P>...releases from coal combustion contain naturally occurring radioactive
<BR>
materials--mainly, uranium and thorium.
<BR>
<P>Former ORNL researchers J. P. McBride, R. E. Moore, J. P. Witherspoon, and
<BR>
R. E. Blanco made this point in their article &quot;Radiological Impact of
<BR>
Airborne Effluents of Coal and Nuclear Plants&quot; in the December 8, 1978,
<BR>
issue of Science magazine. They concluded that Americans living near
<BR>
coal-fired power plants are exposed to higher radiation doses than those
<BR>
living near nuclear power plants that meet government regulations.
<BR>
<P>Since the 1960s particulate precipitators have been used by U.S. coal-fired
<BR>
power plants to retain significant amounts of fly ash rather than letting
<BR>
it escape to the atmosphere. When functioning properly, these precipitators
<BR>
are approximately 99.5% efficient.
<BR>
<P>[Which is to say that 0.5% is released into the environment, though such
<BR>
highly efficient particulate separators are--and I'm guessing on this
<BR>
one--not nearly so common worldwide as they are in the US and Western
<BR>
Europe.]]
<BR>
<P>As population increases worldwide, coal combustion continues to be the
<BR>
dominant fuel source for electricity.
<BR>
<P>[From the charts in the article, world coal consumption for 1980 was 3000
<BR>
million metric tons, projeted for 2000, 4000 million metric tons, and the
<BR>
combined releases of Uranium and Thorium: 7600 mtric tons in 1980 and
<BR>
12,500 metric tons projected for 2000.]
<BR>
<P>The main sources of radiation released from coal combustion include not
<BR>
only uranium and thorium but also daughter products produced by the decay
<BR>
of these isotopes, such as radium, radon, polonium, bismuth, and lead.
<BR>
Although not a decay product, naturally occurring radioactive potassium-40
<BR>
is also a significant contributor.
<BR>
<P>(end of excerpt)
<BR>
<P>To summarize, the global contamination caused by the release of
<BR>
radioactivity associated with coal combustion power generation is so vastly
<BR>
greater than the release from nuclear power generation that, rightly
<BR>
viewed, nuclear power, beyond its central purpose as a power source, is a
<BR>
profoundly effective means of PREVENTING global environmental radioactive
<BR>
contamination.
<BR>
<P>Which, of course, techies have known for years.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
