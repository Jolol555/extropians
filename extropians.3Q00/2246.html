<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Dan, I think you're in fact expressing the very mistake I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; describing in the rest of my post.  The problem arises from mixing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the VALUE of individual autonomy with the OBSERVATION of cultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determinism.  Let me return to the example of the Taliban oppression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of women.  The &quot;compost-modernist&quot; recognizes that there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oppression going on, but is paralyzed from acting to do anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about it because 1) he can't step outside of the view that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Taliban mullahs are oppressive because &quot;that's what their culture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictates&quot; and 2) condemning the oppression is an act of &quot;cultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperialism&quot; based on Western values.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was quite unclear.
<BR>
<P>There really are two kinds of post-modernists.  There are relativist
<BR>
post-modernists, whom, I think, are making a mistake, (the same
<BR>
mistake as the modernists, actually) and there are sollipsist/
<BR>
ethnocentrist post-modernists, whom I think are exactly right.
<BR>
<P>The relativist post-modernist is making a mistake because he thinks
<BR>
he's not being sollipsist/ethnocentrist.  He thinks that by embracing
<BR>
relativism, he's embraced all cultural positions, or no cultural
<BR>
position at all; that he's somehow above all questions which are
<BR>
culturally determined.  He might have delusions that from this
<BR>
position, and from this position alone, he can treat persons from
<BR>
various cultures from a truly unbiased stance.
<BR>
<P>He can't.  The moral relativist can't pull himself up and out of the
<BR>
games we mere humans play; in his attempts, he simply embraces new
<BR>
cultural values.  Worse, his attempts at bootstrapping himself beyond
<BR>
values leaves him with a completely ridiculous set of values from
<BR>
everybody else's perspective.  This might have been his first clue to
<BR>
come down from there and work with us.
<BR>
<P>With that having been said, I think the modernists make the same
<BR>
mistake.  They think that they have found the values which are
<BR>
transcendently right, rather than the values which are culturally
<BR>
determined or which they happen to accept.  The modernist, just like
<BR>
the relativist, believes himself to have found a skyhook that will
<BR>
lift him out of his own skin and into the realm of Truth.  While this
<BR>
is not necessarily a huge problem, it becomes a problem when he goes
<BR>
on to try to pull everyone else &quot;up&quot; to where he is by illegitimate
<BR>
means.
<BR>
<P>Now, thus far, in the stories I've told, you might think that this has
<BR>
been a tale of people going awry because they've embraced sollipsism
<BR>
and ethnocentricism without realizing it; that, if only we could stop
<BR>
being sollipsistic, our problems would be solved.
<BR>
<P>To buy into an argument like this is to be tempted by imaginary
<BR>
skyhooks.  Rather, what we've learned instead is that you CAN'T stop
<BR>
being sollipsistic, and that this is *OK*.  We can only endorse those
<BR>
beliefs which jive with our own beliefs.  We endorse our own beliefs
<BR>
only because they are ours.  We act like modernists only because the
<BR>
difference between acting on our own beliefs *because they're ours* and
<BR>
acting on our own beliefs *because we think that they're transcendently
<BR>
right* yields very similar results.
<BR>
<P>As far as we're concerned, we shouldn't be culturally imperialistic
<BR>
simply because we believe that we shouldn't be culturally
<BR>
imperialistic.  As I said before, we're morally obligated to respect
<BR>
the autonomy of others *BECAUSE* that's what OUR culture dictates;
<BR>
and, as far as we're concerned, our culture takes precedence over the
<BR>
beliefs of other cultures, which might differ.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;  Under this kind of ethnocentricism, we are morally obligated to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  respect the autonomy of others, because that's what our culture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  dictates; if we believed otherwise, we'd be wrong.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Here's an example of what I'm talking about.  Taken out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; context of this discussion, the above quote is unassailable: Of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; course we are &quot;morally obligated to respect the autonomy of others&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but the object of that respect is the individual, not a culture per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; se or an ethnicity.  I have no respect for oppressive Muslim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fundamentalists or tribalists that perform female genital
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutilation, and I have no respect for the cultures that engender
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such behavior.  As Nadia points out, respect for the purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aesthetic traditions of a culture is one thing -- one can't condemn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people for preferring one set of culturally pervasive tonalities in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; music over another, for instance.  But a cultural preference for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brutality is quite another thing.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is right, but only because I think so.  ;)
