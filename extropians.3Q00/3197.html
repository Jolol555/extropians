<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; OK, you're obviously a smart guy.  Let's hear *your* idea for a workable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;social contract&quot; that's going to keep people from pirating music and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; software.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Alright, I don't have any pat answers, but I can suggest directions that we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should be moving towards:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a) Increased Education.  We've been pirating stuff for so long, we've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;forgotten its against the law.  Remind people that some of us make a living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with our brains.  Remind people that IP is valuable... and getting more so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;b) Involved Government.  The law makers need to get online and get wired.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is the new world and it's no longer good enough to just have good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people skills and an understanding of bridge tolls and urban violence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;c) Legitimate Access.  I absolutely agree that the RIAA should have bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Napster-- what were they thinking?  A widely available means to legimately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;access content is desperately needed-- and as a directly commercial venture
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it should be able to offer better, more reliable, more legitimate service
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than anyone else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;d) No wimps in Law Enforcement.  The laws need teeth, and if you're going 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;call it illegal, then do something about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;e) Technology.  To my mind, it's clear that there are huge benefits for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people to be more closely integrated with their information.  Those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;need to be demonstrated and distributed.   New technologies should focus on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personal power-- less about how thousand of college kids can get free 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;music,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more about how you as an individual can make your own music.  Technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that make it easy and profitable for people to be contributory, not easy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;profitable to leech.  Superior encryption should be widely available.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Individuals should be able to participate in totally private, secure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;communication and transactions.  We need smart information: data that knows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stuff about itself, data that follows rules.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seems to me that the *only* one of these suggestions which would have a 
<BR>
chance of succeeding, is more stringent law enforcement.  Nobody has 
<BR>
&quot;forgotten&quot; that its illegal to pirate data.  Its just that nobody gets 
<BR>
busted for it, so nobody is scared to do it.  If there were repeated, 
<BR>
numerous and notorious piracy busts people would think twice before 
<BR>
Napstering data.  *That* would work.  But think of what that would mean...
<BR>
