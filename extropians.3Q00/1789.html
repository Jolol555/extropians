Hi extropians,
<BR>
<P>Offlist I've discussed with a few extropian people a freeware NLU entity
<BR>
that I'm undertaking to develop.
<BR>
<P>Some people had asked for an outline. Unfortunately, I've gone and deleted
<BR>
much of my mail files; as I tend to get hundreds of fat posts per day and my
<BR>
HD was getting choked.
<BR>
<P>I include a gross description here for anyone who might like to participate
<BR>
in such a project; either with me or on your own... just try to keep it GPL
<BR>
please;  I'll attempt to answer any questions you may ask.
<BR>
********************************************************
<BR>
<P>I'm doing a coarse-grained reverse-engineer of a cognitive linguistic
<BR>
entity. What I've been doing is poring over the ordinary psychological
<BR>
literature on (macroscopic) cognition; perception &amp; language.
<BR>
<P>That being done; I set up a simple enough reverse engineered coarse grained
<BR>
paradigm for me to write cognitive software:
<BR>
<P>Functionally, I've divided the macroscopic mind into &quot;domains&quot;: SC; D; J; K;
<BR>
L. Intradomain software process interaction is generally more pronounced
<BR>
than interdomain interaction.
<BR>
<P>The SC domain houses models of the World; ontologies; objects; actions &amp; so
<BR>
forth. The higher constructs of the SC domain constitute &quot;deep structure&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The D domain houses motivational (goal etc) &amp; emotional weightings...it
<BR>
allows context generation &amp; &quot;negotiation&quot; among processes without hogging
<BR>
bandwidth.
<BR>
<P>The L domain houses language... basically a compressional mechanism that
<BR>
interacts seamlessy with the SC domain to facilitate extended world
<BR>
modelling or machine &quot;thought&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The J domain is basically a set of inhibitory modules that allow top-down
<BR>
control of the mental processes of the machine via access from the K domain.
<BR>
<P>The K domain houses a Global Workspace; it is the highest of a hierarchy of
<BR>
workspaces...; it includes an attentional system; a working memory; etc. It
<BR>
is a
<BR>
functional consciousness.
<BR>
************************
<BR>
<P>The processes run independently and should talk to each other via shared
<BR>
memory. Such a machine should run OK on Linux SMP on off-the-shelf or
<BR>
&quot;commodity&quot; machines of the near future.
<BR>
************************
<BR>
<P><P>This is just a hobby, and everything I do will be GPL. What I'm doing just
<BR>
now is some component linguistic systems of the L domain... (i) simple
<BR>
canned NLG &amp; template stuff... mostly ALICEbot like stuff (ii) Sentence
<BR>
Generators (iii) heuristic; algorithmic and pattern matching parsers (iv)
<BR>
simple deep structure models for the SC domain.
<BR>
<P>Sundays only... I'm not yet retired.
<BR>
*************************
<BR>
<P>Since there'd be adjudication for  the dominance of any one process - some
<BR>
sort of winner take all setup - and the processes are reading from
<BR>
blackboards and such - you can just drop a process in. The system
<BR>
theoretically scales well.
<BR>
<P>Each process has a lot of autonomy... but isn't mobile (...save for the
<BR>
SMP - ha ha).
<BR>
<P>I can handle the computational linguistics but I'm almost blind
<BR>
(toxoplasmosis at 2; and leptospirosis at 39 - fun huh?) so the coding is
<BR>
slow.
<BR>
***************************
<BR>
<P>Again, this is doable..I'm writing it in C and for the expected linux
<BR>
server-quality multiprocessor machines of the next 3 years or so... I'd
<BR>
appreciate input &amp; actual coding help from anyone who would be crazy enough
<BR>
to want to do this sort of thing.
<BR>
<P>Thanks (I hope this falls within the scope of this mailing list...),
<BR>
<P>alain
