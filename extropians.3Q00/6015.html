<P><EM>&gt; Where do you think a bunch of mutually competitive uploads are headed,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you're not part of the fray? AIs might beat them on the path to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; SI, if given a chance, but I doubt there will be much subjective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; difference between them two from an outsider's point of view. (Which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably means that it's not a good idea to play the role of a bemused
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onlooker).
</EM><BR>
<P>I only bemuse myself with playing an onlooker when I know that competitive
<BR>
participants are headed nowhere that interferes with my own progress toward
<BR>
transcendence. The Buddha in the robot goes on and on, despite mortal fears.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; One or two of them might be still human (and nice) enough to yank the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bystanders into the virtual realm to prevent them from going extinct,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before zooming off to SI.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I trust SIs to have the nicety to yank the likes of you and me into virtual
<BR>
encyclopedic immortality. After all, if we don't offer SIs  interest and
<BR>
entertainment value equal to or greater than that of dinosaur fossils to
<BR>
archeologists, then we shan't be counted as very interesting at all. Let us not
<BR>
allow our vanity to place ourselves above organisms which ruled the Earth for
<BR>
millions of years, since we have only been around for a few hundred thousand
<BR>
years.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>&quot;The more I meditate on superintelligence, the more deeply I fall in love with
<BR>
it.&quot;
