Just recently, a friend bought a c64 + games, disk drive, all the good
<BR>
stuff, for a total of A$10. I thought &quot;Here we go!&quot;, and went round to his
<BR>
place to check it out. All those cool old games: bruce lee, bard's tale,
<BR>
blue max, spy hunter, wooo, forget the playstation, let the good times roll.
<BR>
<P>Do you know how truly crap those games are today? I was so disillusioned.
<BR>
Someone has replaced the C64 of my memory, with a terrible, awful, boring
<BR>
piece of junk. It's a conspiracy, I tell you. Mr Goddard, forget that Waco
<BR>
stuff; the conspiracy to make C64s look like shocking hunks of crap is
<BR>
afoot. Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, they're all in on it. And the government.
<BR>
Which govt? All of them!
<BR>
<P>Somewhere in a huge warehouse under the pentagon, next to some alien
<BR>
foetuses and the odd box of reports on mass genetic modification
<BR>
experiments, are row upon row of boxes of the real C64s, wrapped up to hide
<BR>
the shining, pure brilliance which naturally eminates from them. That's what
<BR>
the alien abductions are about, you know; they implant all these false
<BR>
memories of surgical procedures and naughty probes to hide the fact that
<BR>
they are swapping your C64 for a pod version, lifeless, spiritless,
<BR>
unnatural.
<BR>
<P>Crap, there's someone trying to break down the door; just got time to hit
<BR>
send...

<EM>&gt;Hey guys/gals, guess what I found this weekend at an antique shop around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corner? A Commodore VIC-20, no kidding. Bout a dozen games, and oh my god,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whole 8K memory expansion card. I may put on the shelf next to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fossilize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dino-turd, though maybe I'll fire it up. It came with the original manual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tape drive...  Maybe I'll put it on ebay...
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, last time I checked the online computer auction sites, there were
<BR>
several VIC-20's and C64's both for sale and wanted.  I still have my
<BR>
original VIC-20 somewhere, and my C-64.  They probably still work.  I ran a
<BR>
little word-processing business in the early '80's on the C64 and a Brother
<BR>
HR15 daisy-wheel, which cost me $500.  In the mid-80's, the C64 came with
<BR>
the GEOS GUI OS, with full desktop publishing capability, on about 30K of
<BR>
free RAM and a 165K floppy drive.  Today, there are people surfing the web
<BR>
on C64's.  Amazing how little real advance we've made, due to MicroSloth...
