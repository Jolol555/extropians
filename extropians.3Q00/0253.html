</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The second time I felt really threatened was when the guys in the black
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;helicopter paid me a visit along with a bunch of their buddies on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ground.  This was a Ruby Ridge scenario.  They claimed that from the air a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couple of Vitex trees I had growing in my garden looked like marijuana.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These guys were very well armed.  If I'd had a gun in my hands, I have no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doubt whatsoever that I'd be dead now.  The guy who appeared to be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leader was very nervous; he seemed to think that I had a cult of followers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secreted in my house or something and that he might never leave my place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alive.  I talked soothingly to him to calm him down and after a while he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lowered his gun.  I don't much like to tell this story, because some people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think I was a coward for not either a. fighting and &quot;taking out&quot; as many as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I could before I went down (and at an abstract level, I think they're at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least partly right [except that my daughter and her friend were here--what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dreadful choice to have to make, between being a coward or leaving my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;daughter motherless--or maybe dead in case they just started shooting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wildly--they seemed very nervous, so they might have done that]if more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people would fight this sort of thing, maybe it wouldn't keep happening); 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;b. suing the federal government for sending men onto my land. Maybe I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have done more research on the latter option.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  They said they had the right to come onto my land without a search 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;warrant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because they had probable cause to think that illegal activities were going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on here due to the Vitex trees, which, as I said, they mistook for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marijuana
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plants. The way I viewed it at the time was that I wouldn't get far by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them--others had tried it and failed to get anywhere.  I hadn't suffered 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real damages--in fact, they helped me out by cutting back a root that was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blocking a gate.  I don't know, though. It's still something that bothers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me.  I remember once seeing a man being taken into the federal courthouse 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;handcuffs and thinking, &quot;Oh, there's a criminal, a bad guy,&quot; and then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suddenly realizing that odds were he wasn't a bad guy at all, that he'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably done something I wouldn't consider a crime at all. That, in fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the bad guys were the ones wearing the guns and driving the car.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;From time to time I hear of people being tortured in prison here is the US,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and I wonder:  truly, how far have things gone?  I know Germans who were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alive during the 1930's and early 40's who had no idea of what was going on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;behind the barbed wire fences.  Maybe, yeah, they looked the other way 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but how do I know I'm not doing that right now?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I hear of political atrocities in other countries supported by US dollars.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And I look the other way and say, &quot;Well, there's nothing I can do about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What IS to be done?  It seems as though, once you pass a certain point, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;path is more or less fixed.  It will be traveled.  And the observers' only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choice is to stand there and hope they don't get mowed down; or to leave.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So many times people have ended up being trapped because they were afraid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;leave the comforts of home, even when they saw bad things coming down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pike.  &quot;It can't happen here.  It won't happen to me,&quot; and all that.
</EM><BR>

Here's a cheerful thought...  These people are always counting on you 
<BR>
thinking that no matter how bad it is, there's something to salvage, some 
<BR>
possibility up to the last moment of survival, even as the guy in front of 
<BR>
you in line is blown away, maybe the horse will sing....
<BR>
<P>So, what about those people for whom that isn't the case?  Like people in 
<BR>
great pain with terminal cancer.  What if we guaranteed them publicity and 
<BR>
honors - a permanent record of their contribution - if they put themselves 
<BR>
on the line and set themselves up as a target that shot back?
