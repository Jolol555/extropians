<P>
I have had several long term mates, of both genders and before and after
<BR>
my own change.  About 60% of them were more or less uncomfortable with
<BR>
transhuman ideas.  Two of them were completely closed minded on the
<BR>
subject.  Which was one of the reasons the relationship did not last. 
<BR>
The longest relationship to date was for 10 years.  The current love of
<BR>
my life is as into this stuff as I am.  Which is one of the things I
<BR>
love about her.
<BR>
<P>I have two natural children, male and female, 15 and 12.  Back when I
<BR>
transitioned the courts apparently thought that made me some kind of
<BR>
pervert as I lost all custodial and visitation rights.  That hasn't
<BR>
stopped me from supporting them for all of these years and mostly
<BR>
supporting my ex too.  So I guess I should say that I have two children
<BR>
and none.
