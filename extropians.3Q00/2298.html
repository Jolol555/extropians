<P>&lt;&lt; I tend to believe that content people sit around and don't do anything
<BR>
&nbsp;important.  It is the dissatisfied people who don't like things the way they
<BR>
&nbsp;are, and feel the urge to explore or change their current situation. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>I know what you mean, however what I think is that there are few disemployed 
<BR>
people who hang glide, or go to Burning Man, or become part of Zubrin's space 
<BR>
organization. Its is (I contend) people with pocket change and time on their 
<BR>
hands who would seek the thrills of outer space. Whatever the world has 
<BR>
become, it is not Islanders setting off in longboats as centuries ago, or 
<BR>
Nick O'reilly setting off from fair, but starved-out, Ireland and move to the 
<BR>
USA. Takes bucks and leisure.
