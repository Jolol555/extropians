Unlike many of the members of this list, I am inclined to agree with Paul.
<BR>
There's too many instances of monopoly power in the history of
<BR>
commerce/capitalism, to believe that the thing would be all roses if we just
<BR>
left it to it's own devices. Monopoly power is the commercial equivalent of
<BR>
feudal overlord domination (bwa ha ha!).
<BR>
<P>I'm still interested in dynamism as a concept, I just think the free market
<BR>
is not the optimal dynamic system to choose, especially if you are
<BR>
interested in the welfare of the individual. I've talked previously (and
<BR>
rather naively, but hey) about an alternative system of participartory
<BR>
democracy &quot;on steroids&quot;, using that to replace the normal concept of
<BR>
exclusive ownership, to which I would attribute most of the really bad
<BR>
points about capitalism.
<BR>
<P>I'm really interested to hear what other people can come up with by way of
<BR>
dynamical social systems which are not free-market based, or at least don't
<BR>
rely on the free market as their major mechanism. Paul, I invite you to
<BR>
start. You're not so hot on uber-capitalism, so what's your alternative?

<EM>&gt; I challenge anyone on this list to demonstrate how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free-markets can exist without a feudalist tyranny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resulting.  Demonstrate how such a system  will not favor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the rich over poor when it comes to basic civil rights and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justice.  If you can't, then you should stop complaining
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when people call you fascists or at best platocracists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure companies are there to meet the demands of the consumer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and stockholders, but that just goes to show you that he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the most money - rich consumer, rich stockholder makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all the rules.  Who is there to protect the little guy?  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you don't give a damn about the little guy, then I rest my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case.
