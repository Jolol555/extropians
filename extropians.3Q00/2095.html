<EM>&gt; I don't remember where I saw this (twas a long time ago), but I discovered I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was looking at a map of the lunar surface, which was all divvied up between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countries/corporations? by what appeared to be property lines.  I also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember hearing about people selling acreage on the moon.  Is this reality?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Who owns the moon?  How was that determined?  Are other concentrations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter/energy out there in space similarly 'claimed'?  I remember reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussions about mining asteroids and such.  Is there a UN sanctioned rule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere, whereby institutions might go about claiming ownership of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; celestial objects?  Should I anticipate hearing about the 'Microsoft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; galaxy'?  Anybody out there know the rules to that game?

<P>Some lunatic (pun intended) has sent claims to the UN and other national
<BR>
governments that he owns the moon, and has a website where he sells titles to
<BR>
sections of the moon, and he's trying to put together, I've heard, a virtual
<BR>
reality world that is based on these homesteaders developing the moon. Since he,
<BR>
and nobody he is associated with, has ever been to the moon, he has no legal
<BR>
basis for claiming it. He claims that by divvying up a map of the moon into
<BR>
plots that that is somehow 'adding value' to the moon to support his land claim,
<BR>
but since he has never been there and done actual surveying, laying out guide
<BR>
posts, etc. those claims are baseless. All his site is good for is illustrating
<BR>
how many people there are who are either gullible, or who have too much spare
<BR>
money they are willing to spend on meaningless things.
