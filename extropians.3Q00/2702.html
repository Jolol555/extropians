<P>&lt;&lt; That being said, the same land could be used to set up windmills
<BR>
&nbsp;too.  Windmills and cornfields should cohabitate nicely.  spike &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>In the USA, wind turbines need to be connected to some effective storage 
<BR>
system, specifically fuel cells, to be the most vital. However, the 
<BR>
marketplace seems to dictate merely getting in the wind turbines 1st. Grasses 
<BR>
inter-mixed with GM crops like weed-trees, or soy should greatly reduce soil 
<BR>
erosion. The focus of fuel crops appears to be most useful with 
<BR>
transportation fuels for autos, and trucks, and construction vehicles. My 
<BR>
earlier comment regarding Dr. Thomas Gold and his estimates that most 
<BR>
petroleum is of abiological origin, and that supplies potentially exist in 
<BR>
the hundred times range of current oil estimates. Such a &quot;wildcard&quot; would 
<BR>
obviate the economics of energy production for centuries.
