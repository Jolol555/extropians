<EM>&gt; &gt; Corporations are a matter of people getting together cooperatively to

<EM>&gt; &gt; organize their efforts.  How can it be evil for a group of people to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; voluntarily organize, and to offer jobs to others?  Every aspect of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the process, from the formation of the corporation, to the job offer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the acceptance, is voluntary and agreed to by all concerned.

<P>There must be opportunities in the world for making profits while doing
<BR>
evil. The corporation as a form of relatively efficient organization
<BR>
allows more of these opportunities to be accessed. 
<BR>
<P>A lot of evil contributed to big corporations seem to consist of
<BR>
situations where two parties voluntarily cooporate on some effort, but
<BR>
because one of the parties is in a significantly weaker bargaining
<BR>
position (because of market conditions, lack of information, or
<BR>
whatever), most of the benefit deriving from the effort goes to the other
<BR>
party (i.e. shareholders of the corporation). Is it evil to take
<BR>
advantage of other people, even though they would prefer that you did?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The only difference in the two instances could be that in the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case the business might be a simple partnership, and in the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; case it was a corporation, having duly filed &quot;articles of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incorporation&quot; with the secretary of state of the state of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Massachusetts.  And therefore in one case I can recover damages from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the business owners and in the other case I might not.  This strikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me as something which materially affects me to which I never agreed.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is true, but what is your proposed alternative? Do you seriously
<BR>
suggest eliminating liability limitation for corporations? What about
<BR>
the liability limitation represented by personal bankruptcies?
