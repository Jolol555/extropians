<P><EM>&gt; Hi extropians,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A lot of &quot;scientific&quot; sorts base their outlook on a nineteenth century
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conceptual Universe.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the late '20s,  of this century, Quantum Theory had introduced serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grounds for the legitimization of mysticism in physics - and by the time Von
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Neumann &amp; Wigner finished with it, even frank spirituality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Early in the century experiments showed that events at a sufficiently small
<BR>
scale could not be modeled by classical Newtonian mechanics.  Quantum Theory was
<BR>
developed to present a predictive model of these repeatable, but seemingly
<BR>
strange results.  There is no grounds for mysticism here, although throughout
<BR>
history, lack of knowledge has been used to justify belief in the supernatural.
<BR>
Lack of knowledge provides neither support nor refutation.  Thomas Jefferson
<BR>
wrote, &quot;Ignorance is preferable to error, and he is closer to the truth who
<BR>
believes nothing than he who believes what is wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Parallel with that, Church; Godel; Post &amp; Turing certainly formulated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rigorous ideas on computability that allowed (...even encouraged, some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say...) mysticism in our logic &amp; epistemology.
</EM><BR>
<P>They showed that non provable truths exist *outside* our logic &amp; epistemology,
<BR>
not inside.  The fact that some non provable proposition *could* be true, does
<BR>
you no good in trying to break the symmetry among all non-falsifiable beliefs.
<BR>
(A symmetry which is generally broken simply by the existing beliefs of the
<BR>
family one is born into.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is perhaps unscientific (...in a 21st century sense...) to dismiss all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mystics as Know Nothings.
</EM><BR>
<P>Certainly some of  these folks know a great deal about their beliefs, and it is
<BR>
scientific to try to use our reasoning to discover why they have these beliefs.
<BR>
I read the following two paragraphs from _The Meme Machine_ by Susan Blackmore,
<BR>
to a group discussing this topic at the last Foresight Senior Associates
<BR>
gathering:
<BR>
<P>-    Like it or not, we are surrounded by religions.  The 'Great Faiths' of the
<BR>
- world have lasted thousands of years and affect our calendars and
<BR>
- holidays, our education and upbringing, our beliefs and our morality.
<BR>
- All over the world people spend vast amounts of time and money
<BR>
- worshipping their gods and building glorious monuments in which to
<BR>
- do it.  We cannot get away from religions, but using memetics we can
<BR>
- understand how and why they have such power.
<BR>
-    All the great religions of the world began as small-scale cults, usually
<BR>
- with a charismatic leader, and over the years a few of them spread to take
<BR>
- in billions of people all across the planet.  Imagine just how many small
<BR>
- cults there must have been in the history of the world.  The question is
<BR>
- why did these few survive to become the great faiths, while the vast
<BR>
- majority simply died out with the death of their leader or the dispersal of
<BR>
- their few adherents?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've known of mystical rabbis with Ph. Ds in theoretical physics and I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; met vedantic philosophers whose grasp of modern physics was breathtaking.
</EM><BR>
<P>Good!!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There's a lot of &quot;feel-good&quot; non-reasoning behind some New Age stuff - but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you can't dismiss the lot unless you've read them or engaged them in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meaningful dialogue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have. Not enough, I'm sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>Bring it on, we will dialogue meaningfully.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But there's a hell of a lot of orthodox scientific bigotry going on here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Natural, to be sure, in a Kuhnian sense... but to be kept in rein - if we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; want to be good extropians.
</EM><BR>
<P>Scientific skepticism can look like bigotry to those not used to it.  That is
<BR>
not to deny any exists.  The way you find out is to present your ideas and
<BR>
counter the objections with facts and reason.
