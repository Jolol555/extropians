<EM>&gt; &gt; Another topic: I have evidently gotten a really bad virus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perhaps by pissing off some lurking greens, who retaliated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; against my innocent little computer.

<P>No need, galant knight.  I fixed it.  I have no evidence that
<BR>
it was the greens, it might not have even been a virus.  It did
<BR>
get me thinking tho, I have made comments online that surely
<BR>
would enrage both the greens and the religion people.  I am
<BR>
kinda surprised no one has threatened me (since I posted my
<BR>
snail mail address online) and no one has intentionally tried
<BR>
to virus me that I can prove.
<BR>
<P>I found a folder marked inbox and I just deleted the whole thing.
<BR>
I lost all the old messages I was saving, about 900 of them, but oh
<BR>
well.  I likely never woulda gotten around to them again anyway,
<BR>
and besides, the whole adventure was kinda like being really really
<BR>
constipated and taking a whole bunch of exlax: altho painful,
<BR>
at least its all cleaned out now.  {8^D  spike
