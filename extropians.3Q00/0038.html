<P>&lt;&lt; We were probably never producing those plasma phenomina. The geophysics of 
<BR>
&nbsp;planet earth has likely been producing ball lightning for 4 billion years.  
<BR>
&nbsp;Piezo-electric effects seem to accomplish the task. What's the big deal?
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
I am not entirely sure if this is on point or not but as I read the various 
<BR>
posts on this subject two thoughts keep running through my mind.
<BR>
1.  Ball lightning has been around for years and although not common has 
<BR>
shown up fairly regularly.  In my lifetime (wm65) I have only heard of it 
<BR>
among my immediate associates one time.  A neighboring farmer saw it while 
<BR>
milking his cow (when I was a teenager) and got knocked cold for his further 
<BR>
amusement.
<BR>
2.  Every pilot knows that his aircraft has a static electricity dispenser 
<BR>
located on the trailing edge of various surfaces.  I don't know if this is 
<BR>
the practice on jet aircraft, however.  If the static electricity accumulated 
<BR>
by the passage of the aircraft through the atmosphere is not returned to the 
<BR>
atmosphere then a charge builds up and the result is St. Elmo's fire.  The 
<BR>
description of Foo Fighters in many cases sounds suspiciously like that 
<BR>
static electricity.
<BR>
3.  Purely a personal note.  I developed a very serious ambition to become a 
<BR>
career pilot at roughly age ten.  Later I became a SF addict.  I did fly as a 
<BR>
crew man and a student pilot in the Navy.  All my life, since ten years of 
<BR>
age, I have habitually watched the sky for my personal interest and 
<BR>
amusement.  During that time I have seen countless UFOs and thought that I 
<BR>
was finally getting to see one also.  However, in all honesty, I have to say 
<BR>
that every UFO I have experienced has been successfully reduced to an IFO 
<BR>
much to my disappointment.
<BR>
4.  I hope we finally come to understand plasma and its appearance as ball 
<BR>
lightning.  Maybe I'll even one day get to see a real UFO. :)
