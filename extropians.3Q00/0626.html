</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I've been making a list of the reasons why I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people are prone to believe in deities.  This has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably been covered before but I missed it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BTW, this doesn't mean I'm an atheist.  It means that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I see lots of reasons why we are predisposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believing in god(s). This makes me pretty skeptical of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any human-generated belief system regarding a creator.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd be interested in hearing about any possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reasons that I've missed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

6. Let God Decide
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Many people appear to relish the idea that they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relinquish responsibility for their lives by placing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it in God’s hands.  This tends to happen when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decisions are very difficult to make either due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;complexity or to insufficient information.  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strategy once again serves to relieve anxiety and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;provides hope to those who perceive themselves to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in hopeless situations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What have I left out?  or how might I clarify these?
</EM><BR>
<P>As a probably separate item:  The essense of the attraction of Christianity 
<BR>
was the forgiveness of sins.  Divine grace made it possible for the worst, 
<BR>
most thoroughly evil sadistic mass murderer to be made into a &quot;new person in 
<BR>
Christ.&quot;  I don't know of any other religion that made such an offer.
<BR>
<P>Guilt is a powerful force.  Guilt and revenge have been the cause of endless 
<BR>
regional ethnic wars.  Christianity let the guilty off the hook and provided 
<BR>
a mechanism for them to start over as an accepted member of the community.  
<BR>
Ask any Christian what the essense of their belief is and they will tell you 
<BR>
that it's John 3:16 - let me see if I can still do it from memory - &quot;For God 
<BR>
so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, so that whosoever 
<BR>
might believe in him should not perish but should be granted eternal life in 
<BR>
Jesus Christ Our Lord.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Probably extropians tend to focus on the eternal life / fear of death 
<BR>
embodied in this near quote.  But the underlying reality is that washing 
<BR>
away of sins by the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.  Only by washing away 
<BR>
the sins could man be allowed into heaven.
<BR>
<P>But &quot;heaven&quot; is just an abstraction.  No one comes back to report to 
<BR>
congregation on current weather or menus or musical fare in heaven.  
<BR>
However, being &quot;saved&quot; has immediate social value, in that the other 
<BR>
Christians are bound to treat you as that &quot;new man.&quot;  Technically, since God 
<BR>
has forgiven you, they can't second guess Him and off you for your prior 
<BR>
transgretions.
<BR>
<P>And the church provided mechanisms - especially the early church or the 
<BR>
catholic church in the Middle Ages - for peacefully resolving disputes and 
<BR>
dealing with &quot;sins,&quot; separate from the civil process, but revolving around 
<BR>
this idea that your central relationship was with God, not your fellow man, 
<BR>
so that once God had decided something, they interfered or ignored God's 
<BR>
will at their peril.
<BR>
<P>Not that I believe any of the above - just to make that clear.  But this 
<BR>
whole central aspect to Christianity especially tends to be ignored by 
<BR>
non-Christians, I've noticed.
