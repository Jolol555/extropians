<EM>&gt;From: Barbara Lamar &lt;<A HREF="mailto:shabrika@juno.com?Subject=Re:%20Responsibility%20for%20children&In-Reply-To=&lt;F121ILoygXLsxpTljBO000015b6@hotmail.com&gt;">shabrika@juno.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;Society&quot; shouldn't be making such choices in the first place.  It's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individual WOMAN who has to use up her energy, her time, her spirit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;growing the embryo into a baby.
</EM><BR>
<P>Listen, as a father of two children I know that pregancy and labor are no 
<BR>
picnic for the woman.  But, since you are a mother I'm sure you realize that 
<BR>
the *real* labor doesn't start until *after* the baby is born.  Moreover, 
<BR>
even if pregnancy and labor were harder than actually raising the child 
<BR>
(which I *highly* doubt), pregnancy &amp; labor last at most approx. 9 months.  
<BR>
Raising a kid is a job for life (or  at least 18 years).
<BR>
<P>People (usually women) always argue for the *woman's* right to choose, 
<BR>
because she does all the work of pregnancy and labor.  My response is &quot;So 
<BR>
what?&quot;  The hardest and longest part of having a child is rearing once it 
<BR>
gets here, and in this the man has every bit as much responsibility as the 
<BR>
woman.  Yes, I know that not every man lives up to this responsibility.  But 
<BR>
that's beside the point.  Even if all men are not as actively involved in 
<BR>
their kids lives as mothers are, they usually foot most of the bill 
<BR>
financially.
<BR>
<P>Yet, nobody ever talks about the *man's* right to choose.  Once he delivers 
<BR>
the seed, he has no say about whether the fetus is aborted or allowed to 
<BR>
become a human being whom the father will be responsible (financially, if 
<BR>
not otherwise) for the next 18 years.  Rather than a *woman's* right to 
<BR>
choose, how about the *parents'* right to choose?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I know I'm treading on VERY thin ice with the following statement, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd argue in favor of a woman's right to dispose of a newly born baby.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I could go on for another hour or two in response to that...  But 
<BR>
suffice it to say that what you are advocating is clearly the right to 
<BR>
murder the most defenseless members of society.  Hitler would be proud.
