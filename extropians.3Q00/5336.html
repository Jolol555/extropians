<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28 GREENPEACE VOLUNTEERS ACQUITTED IN GM TRIAL
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GREENPEACE CALLS ON GOVERNMENT TO END GM FARM EXPERIMENTS
<BR>
<P>London, 20th September, 2000 -- Twenty-eight Greenpeace volunteers were
<BR>
acquitted today of criminal damage
<BR>
at Norwich Crown Court in Eastern England when a second jury failed to reach
<BR>
a verdict. The volunteers had
<BR>
originally been put on trial in April when a jury had acquitted them of
<BR>
theft and failed to reach a verdict on
<BR>
criminal damage.
<BR>
<P>The volunteers had gone on trial on September 4th on charges relating to a
<BR>
Greenpeace action at Lyng,
<BR>
Norfolk, in the UK, on 26th July, 1999, where part of an experimental crop
<BR>
of genetically modified (GM) maize
<BR>
was cut down and sealed in bags as part of a campaign to prevent genetic
<BR>
contamination of the environment.
<BR>
The failure of the prosecution to secure a conviction means that the
<BR>
volunteers cannot be put on trial again
<BR>
and are formally acquitted.
<BR>
<P>Speaking immediately after the verdict, Peter Melchett, Executive Director
<BR>
of Greenpeace UK, said:
<BR>
<P>&quot;This acquittal totally vindicates our campaign to prevent genetic pollution
<BR>
of the environment. The
<BR>
Government clearly cannot find a jury prepared to convict us for protecting
<BR>
property and the environment from
<BR>
genetic pollution. We now call on Government to end the GM farm scale trials
<BR>
before any further genetic
<BR>
pollution of the environment occurs.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The previous trial in April this year resulted in all of the volunteers
<BR>
being acquitted of theft while the jury could
<BR>
not reach a verdict over the charge of criminal damage.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Greenpeace wanted to remove the GM maize in Norfolk because we believe that
<BR>
GM crops will inevitably
<BR>
contaminate the environment. The UK Government's own commissioned advisors -
<BR>
the John Innes Centre
<BR>
- told them that contamination was inevitable but they chose to ignore that
<BR>
advice. Since July 1999, crops of
<BR>
cotton in Greece have been found to have been contaminated by GM cotton and
<BR>
have had to be destroyed, the
<BR>
same has happened to oil seed rape and soya crops in France, and hundreds of
<BR>
fields
<BR>
of oil seed rape were contaminated in the UK and had to be destroyed&quot;,
<BR>
Melchett continued.
<BR>
<P>The UK Government is currently reviewing separation distances imposed
<BR>
between GM crops and other similar
<BR>
crops. Greenpeace has been consistently saying that the separation distances
<BR>
are completely inadequate and
<BR>
that GM crops should not be released into the environment to contaminate the
<BR>
food chain.
<BR>
<P>The GM maize at Lyng was designed to be fed to animals, in the production of
<BR>
beef, milk and other dairy
<BR>
products like butter and cream. GM material is still being used to feed farm
<BR>
animals in Europe although
<BR>
a growing number of retailers - such as Iceland in the UK, Delhaize le Lion
<BR>
in Belgium, Migros in Switzerland,
<BR>
Carrefour in France and Coop in Italy - are already committed to selling
<BR>
animal products from animals not fed
<BR>
on GM crops. Greenpeace expects other European retailers to follow suit over
<BR>
the next four weeks.
