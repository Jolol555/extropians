<P>
another excellent topic, Natasha
<BR>
<P>I love what you say about have a beautiful psychology. As one goes 
<BR>
&quot;out-of-body&quot; by going on line, all that is visible (other than a typeface) 
<BR>
is one's psyche. Sure we can go to a website, look at a picture, and 
<BR>
sometimes the beauty inside is reflected outside. But. Too many times ugly 
<BR>
people have beautiful skins, and they show their &quot;true colors&quot; on a list 
<BR>
forum or in posts...  or a person who seems frumpish and drab in person may 
<BR>
have Beautiful Emotions and lovely thoughts, images...words flowing as an 
<BR>
online entity... 
<BR>
this &quot;inside out&quot; approach is what first fascinated me about meeting people 
<BR>
thru the net.
<BR>
<P>As one who is vividly enthusiastic about beauty, I think one of the things 
<BR>
you might explore is pushing the envelope of *what* we accept as beauty. As 
<BR>
you know, I believe advertising has much to do with what we commonly eat - 
<BR>
visually as well as actual fuel nourishment. With your background and 
<BR>
knowledge of aesthetics and ads, and your cool art series about body 
<BR>
enhancement, what can you see being needed...
<BR>
<P>... as the new beauty alarms, repels, attracts, ...look, if people start to 
<BR>
modify... leopard skins, diamond nails, fish scales, translucent eyeballs, 
<BR>
extra long limbs, extreme thickness of muscles, etc. Some people won't know 
<BR>
how to react, will they?
<BR>
<P>Things that NOW look freakish, because they'd be impossible naturally.
<BR>
Will there be prejudice against mods? I think so.. unless....
<BR>
People will accept it ... surely they need to be re-educated... will it be 
<BR>
cool? Wil it be a trend? um...sure...if it's presented well, and backed by 
<BR>
sponsorship and ads?
<BR>
public awareness? endorsments? what....
