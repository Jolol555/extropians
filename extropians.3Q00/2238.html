I always jump on such &quot;statistics&quot; or &quot;polls.&quot;  Partially, its because I
<BR>
studied proper scientific method and statistical analysis as part of my
<BR>
psychology and biology minors.  Often, I become suspicious just reading
<BR>
these &quot;reports.&quot;  The obvious telling sign is when they don't specifically
<BR>
state what the question was, but rather they just give their conclusions.
<BR>
<P>In this case, Peter Saunders is a research manager from the Australian
<BR>
Institute of Family Studies.  &quot;We've been involved in research where a whole
<BR>
range of people have taken jobs that pay less to be able to spend more time
<BR>
with family and the people they're close to,&quot; he said.
<BR>
<P>Also, the annual survey is part of the national SmartSex Week, is part of a
<BR>
campaign raising awareness about safe sex practices, and is sponsored by
<BR>
Australia's leading condom manufacturer.  This already tends to put the
<BR>
questions in a sexual context, and was probably asked of sexually active
<BR>
people.
<BR>
<P>Such &quot;polls&quot; have to be unbiased and not associated with a certain group or
<BR>
subject.  Just by appearing in &quot;SmartSex Week,&quot; I think people interpreted
<BR>
all the questions as relating to their sexual lives, even if they weren't
<BR>
intended that way.  So questions about romance vs. money were probably
<BR>
interpreted as, &quot;do you have sex for romance or for money?&quot;  Questions about
<BR>
romance vs. sports were probably interpreted as, &quot;do you lay someone because
<BR>
you like them, or is it a sporting game you play?&quot;
<BR>
<P>I wish the actual questions were shown in these &quot;reports&quot; instead of just
<BR>
conclusions.  Without the questions, I almost feel like I am being told,
<BR>
&quot;Trust me that people believe this way, but I won't show you the evidence.&quot;

<EM>&gt; &gt; I enjoyed this article about Australia.  Becky, the

<EM>&gt; &gt; beautiful aussie girl I grew close to on the net was as I

<EM>&gt; &gt; remember pretty mercenary in talking to me about the

<EM>&gt; Interesting article, but I wonder what the sample size was!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I get a bit suspicious of these surveys when basic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information such as this isn't given. Sydney/NSW scored
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highest in the &quot;materialism&quot; stakes, which is no surpise I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guess. The Olympic profit bandwagon is rolling well and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truly!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've also just finished watching the first episode  of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Robert Hughes' TV documentary &quot;Beyond The Fatal Shore&quot;, on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contemporary Australia. As usual R.H. is eloquent and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting, watch it if you get a chance. Again you must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; always guard against too much generalisation, though.
