</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Your slippery slope argument is is... uh... dumb.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thanks for saying so, I think yours is as idiotic as well.  Now can we
</EM><BR>
please
<BR>
<EM>&gt; get back to being civil?  :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, okay.  (Mr. Poopy Pants.)
<BR>
<P>No, no really, you're right, let's be civil.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P><P>Okay, I snipped a big chunk here where you say that -I'm- on the slippery
<BR>
slope because the lines are drawn in arbitrary places, etc, etc.
<BR>
<P>My only response to this is to sort of shrug and say, well, it's
<BR>
complicated!
<BR>
<P>People seem to have a problem with that, but as I've posted earlier, I'm
<BR>
willing to accept that we need complex rules to facilitate the increasingly
<BR>
intricacy of our dealings with each other.  I'm not excited about the
<BR>
prospect of getting bogged down in details, but my feathers aren't
<BR>
especially ruffled at the concept of 'grey areas' of IP.
<BR>
<P>I agree that the current system is not perfect.  I think it's going to need
<BR>
to change very quickly to keep up.  I'd be interested in trying to solve
<BR>
that problem.  But I don't think the solution is simply to abandon IP.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; Isn't there a nice reasonable attractor state somewhere between
</EM><BR>
&quot;absolute
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dictatorial control over IP&quot; and &quot;absolute elimination of IP?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would hope so, but no one seems to be debating this as bluntly as I am.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Almost everyone says we must keep IP laws to protect creators, the
</EM><BR>
economy, etc.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; without seeing the full ramifications of what those IP laws can do when
</EM><BR>
they are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; abused.  I *am* questioning the who kitten caboodle, including the legal
</EM><BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; corporate system as it is now.  Lets play this out.
</EM><BR>
<P>On this thread I'd say that there are way more people arguing -against- IP
<BR>
than -for.-  But maybe I'm just hearing the wolves at the door...
<BR>
<P>Which reminds me... I was going to start to look for a gracious way to
<BR>
extricate myself from this debate...
<BR>
<P>Argh!  Damn, I just cut my... uh... fingers... on the... uh sharp corners of
<BR>
my... uh... keyboard!  Just... enough... energy left... to finish...
<BR>
message....
<BR>
<P><P><P>But lets get are facts straight,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; most artists are prolific creators regardless of the money supply.
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, well since you're getting your facts straight, where do you get this
<BR>
data from?
<BR>
<P>Sure this is my opinion. but it is shared  overwhelming by the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of musicians (including myself) who I know.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you a professional musician?  Are your friends professional musicians?
<BR>
I ask because the overwhelming majority of all of the professional artists
<BR>
that I work with are in favor of IP.  Uh... you know, cause they like to get
<BR>
paid for their work.  I'd be interested to hear the point of view of people
<BR>
who sell their music for a living and are in favor of removing IP.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; You seem to keep missing the point - physical and intellectual property
</EM><BR>
are not
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the same.  One is limited, the other can be replicated at next to no cost.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please do not confuse them again.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sorry, I'm very slow.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Please see my car analogy if you need a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; refresher.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did, and I'm quite refreshed now, thank you.
<BR>
<P>Please feel free to wade back over the 40+ some pages I've written on this
<BR>
subject to the list.  If you go back far enough, you'll discover some of my
<BR>
arguments against making the distinction you make above.  IMHO it's -all-
<BR>
going to be intellectual property eventually... well, most of it, anyway.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; It appears to me that people who rail against the divide seem remarkably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; blind to a lot of the benefits unequal distribution of weath confers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Please tell that to the other 90% of the world who feel lucky for having
</EM><BR>
clean
<BR>
<EM>&gt; water and a place to live.  Sheesh!
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not happy about the living conditions of those 90%.  But the question
<BR>
remains: would conditions on this planet have turned out better if we never
<BR>
implemented the concept of ownership over things?  Again, I think
<BR>
Communism -is- successful at equalizing things-- it just equalizes everyone
<BR>
at a lower level.
<BR>
<P><P><P><P>Well, you say lots of other clever things that need rebuttal, but to be
<BR>
frank, my heart's not in it.
<BR>
<P>It's not your fault, but the same things keep getting said over and over
<BR>
again and it's, uh, kinda getting boring, for everyone I'm sure.
<BR>
<P>And when it's -not- boring, it makes me sit and type -way- too much.
<BR>
<P>And I gotta work or else the bad credit card men will come and take my
<BR>
computer away.
