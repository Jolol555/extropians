<EM>&gt;Taking the responsibility of carrying a gun is going to change you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It forces you to think of yourself as a killer, as one who is willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to kill.  Admittedly, if you actually save your life by carrying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gun then any costs it imposes are worthwhile.  But the chance that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will actually be killed by violence are highly remote.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Given the very small probability of this outcome, the costs in terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of your alienation from society must be considered significant.  In the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long run your survival prospects will be hurt by having a lesser degree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of social connectivity.

<P>Looking at this from the other side of the fence, I find remarkably little
<BR>
to argue with.  I'd probably speak of it as the &quot;survivor&quot; mentality,
<BR>
rather than using the prejudicial term &quot;killer&quot; (which is usually reserved
<BR>
for aggressors).
<BR>
<P>I'd also be more likely to tout the survival benefits of the other side.
<BR>
The mindset that enables one to separate themselves from the herd offers
<BR>
more than just the ability to defend against an inter-species attack: when
<BR>
the lemmings march over the cliff, it's the socially disconnected who
<BR>
survive.  That both strategies persist in nature (and in man) suggests that
<BR>
each have offered their share of success in the past, but the changes in
<BR>
our environment that we foresee in the near future could easily tip the
<BR>
balance heavily one way or the other.  Whether the balance will tip, and
<BR>
which way: I haven't a clue--but for many of us the wager has long since
<BR>
been laid (in my case, I suspect it was at my conception...).
