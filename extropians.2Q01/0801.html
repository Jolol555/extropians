Samantha, <a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Reliberion%20(was%20Re:%20How%20To%20Live%20In%20A%20Simulation)&In-Reply-To=&lt;30.11e6ba72.27e462da@aol.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>, wrote, in relevant part:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, I think we might be in a time-loop where this period is part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the becoming/being of God[s] which then transcend space-time and become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;part of our being becoming them, if you see what I mean.  The awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and very being is looped upon itself.
</em><br>
<p>I initially approached the problem of justifying a reliberion in something 
<br>
like that fashion, though I somewhat crudely posited that because godlike 
<br>
beings could transcend barriers of time, one might currently exist in both 
<br>
normal and godlike forms.  You would under that theory have reason to pray to 
<br>
(or curse) the god you will become.  I say &quot;crudely&quot; because how gods 
<br>
transcend time remains, to say the least, a bit unclear.  Positing that by 
<br>
definition a &quot;god&quot; has omnipotence seems a bit of a hack, and handwaving 
<br>
about mysterious and as-of-yet undeveloped technologies hardly improves 
<br>
matters.  So I regard the VR-cum-incubator as a bit more plausible a theory, 
<br>
though to say that it places fewer demands on credulity is not to say that it 
<br>
rises to the level of believability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, I think you have a sound beginning of something that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workable.  Add to that an ethical side of choosing the type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;super/trans/beings we which to become and releasing/transcending our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current ideational/emotional/psychological bonds that hold us back and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imprinting new patterns and I think you have most of what is needed.  
</em><br>
<p>Those seem like sensible goals writ large, but I am hard-pressed to imagine 
<br>
any way to justify ethical precepts except by reference to what might 
<br>
actually help one become a god.  And given that both Nietzcheans and 
<br>
Buddhists pursue an analogous sort of transcendence, it looks unlikely that 
<br>
that a general theory will offer one single answer to the problem.  But a 
<br>
theology of simulation perhaps demands exactly that sort of diversity of 
<br>
views, given that the simulation aims to generate new beings in an 
<br>
evolutionary--and thus competitive--fashion.  So I should think that a 
<br>
reliberion of the sort of describe would operate functionally rather than 
<br>
substantively, encouraging technologies that promote godhood in general and 
<br>
the creation of simulated life in particular and celebrating competition 
<br>
between various approaches to that end.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I further think that such a religion might well safe us from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tremendous amount of pain, unrootedness and random, increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;powerful collisions of differing goal/belief systems as we head toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity.  It might we form a core appealing to both spiritual and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific aspects and people and a crucial point of unity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's sort of the idea I had in mind: plug the religion meme receptor 
<br>
site with a theology that would not cause nearly so much harm, would not 
<br>
prove inherently distasteful to self-respecting transhumanists, and that 
<br>
might serve some important social coordination functions.  I think myself 
<br>
singularly (if you'll pardon the pun) unsuited to evangelizing, but I do 
<br>
enjoy the rhetorical exercise.
