<p>Right, yes, of course.  That was my point.  Answering the qualia
<br>
question only changes your answer to the question of *why* you'd
<br>
undergo destructive uploading, not *whether* you'd do so.  Some people
<br>
think that they'd be able to preserve themselves that way, but even
<br>
those who don't should (and would!) undergo the process anyway, if
<br>
only for altruism's sake.

<p>Fine, fine.  But (and this was my point) what does it *matter*, since
<br>
you're making the same choice as someone who *did* think that they
<br>
were preserving themselves?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that this philosophical distinction changes nothing
<br>
more than what we *call* this scenario (self-preservation/altruism)
<br>
and how we'll feel about it.
<br>
<p>Now, with that said, maybe that's reason enough to say that it
<br>
matters.  But *that* question feels pretty trivial, at least to me.
