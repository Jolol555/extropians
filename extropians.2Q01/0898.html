<p>&lt;&lt; I have some other concerns about Tipler's model, but what you mention
<br>
&nbsp;was my primary concern.  We face a Dysonian end-game, not a Tiplerian
<br>
&nbsp;one, and our successors will face distinctly limited resources. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Maybe I am making your point for you, but if we do not come up with better 
<br>
physics and technology, then its over. If you or any of the Extropians alive 
<br>
now fail to get uploaded, or somehow can be culled as memories from nitrogen 
<br>
freezing, then its really the big goodbye, not only for us but any 
<br>
intelligence that comes after us. As for Dyson, I believe that Edward Witten 
<br>
disagrees with the sustainability of the Dyson Scenario.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;First, they aren't going to have resources to do what we're in.  Second,
<br>
they'll never really know what we were due to complexity, uncertainty,
<br>
and the veil of relativity (they can never see any photon we emit and
<br>
so can't back-calculate its consequences)&gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>In Forever, For All, by Computer Scientist and Alcor employee, R. Michael 
<br>
Perry, holds that a kind or reverse determinism applies, in regards to 
<br>
photons, utlizing phase conservation. Is this workable? Will we need such 
<br>
theoretical structures such as transverable wormholes or other creations or 
<br>
discoveries to recreate past personalities? I  wouldn't be surprised. Even 
<br>
quantum physics seemed magic to Einstein and Bohr, at first.
