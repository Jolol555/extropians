<em>&gt; &quot;True, alas true.  A quarter century of CR has left a mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shell of a man, 6 ft tall, 125 pounds.  I have a washboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back.  I prefer the phrase &quot;brain and bone&quot; however.&quot;

</em><br>
<p>No.  I flee in horror from the beach.
<br>
<p>Actually if I ever go there, I cover all my skin, long pants, long
<br>
sleeves, sox, shoes and hat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...have you been tracking your CR with blood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemistry tests of any kind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CBC, glucose, IGF-1, or any of those?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If available, I think they would be MOST interesting to the group.
</em><br>
<p>How do I get all that stuff?  I have records from 18 blood donations,
<br>
but I dont think they measure any of those parameters.
<br>
<p>Ive never been scientific about CR other than to alternate
<br>
vitamins, a few months with, a few months without for
<br>
several years to see what they do, and to vary the calories
<br>
to see if there is any correllation, CR with depression/anxiety,
<br>
or anything else.  I kept a record book for a few years
<br>
as a teenager.  My admittedly unscientific finding: the
<br>
vitamins didn't do anything at all, and if there is any
<br>
correllation between CR and depression it was weak
<br>
indeed in my case.  Perhaps I was using the wrong
<br>
vitamins?  Mine were standard grocery store variety,
<br>
nothing exotic.  I eventually gave them up, but I may
<br>
go back again to a limited regimen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Were you a skinny sort of guy before you started CR? To me, at 70.5&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 165lbs and 8% bodyfat, 6' 125lbs seems almost borderline impossible.
</em><br>
<p>Ja, its scary.  My BMI has always been in the
<br>
neighborhood of 17.  On the brighter side, Ive
<br>
escaped the health problems that have cursed
<br>
my family.  Im 40:  several people have told me
<br>
that I dont look a day over 39.
<br>
<p>Of course, they told me that 10 years ago, but
<br>
lets not get hung up in the details.
<br>
<p>On the down side, Im pretty sure that CR causes
<br>
severe brain damage.  Thats my story anyway, and Im
<br>
sticking to it.  spike
