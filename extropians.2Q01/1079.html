<p>
Well, even though we are often accused of and even flagellate ourselves for 
<br>
being over-optimistic, this thread on the ISS should stand as evidence that 
<br>
we aren't fans of just any technological project that comes along.  And even 
<br>
though I may seem to be a cheerleader for ANY project that throws ANYTHING 
<br>
above the Earth's atmosphere, I agree with basically all of the criticism of 
<br>
the ISS program we've seen.  With the axing of the ACRV, US Propulsion module 
<br>
and the TransHab module, I can't see how the folks who run the ISS will have 
<br>
the time or energy to do anything more than keep the thing operating as a 
<br>
string of pressurized tin cans.
<br>
<p>Trying to salvage (or rationalize) some of my instinctive admiration for the 
<br>
folks working on this project, there is this potential bright spot.  ISS is 
<br>
building a cadre of experienced space designers, builders and operators.  
<br>
Maybe they're building the wrong thing the wrong way with the wrong tools for 
<br>
the wrong reasons, but they ARE building SOMETHING pretty big in LEO and, 
<br>
even accepting all the caveats about what, why and how they're doing it, 
<br>
they're being amazingly successful.
<br>
<p>So, taking all of the observations that have been made about ISS into 
<br>
account, two questions present themselves to me: 1) Can the ISS be &quot;salvaged&quot; 
<br>
programmatically at some future date for uses that lend themselves to more 
<br>
rational goals; and 2) can the cadre of space designers and builders who are 
<br>
working on the project be redirected into more useful work before their 
<br>
knowledge and experience becomes stale.
<br>
<p>Spike makes the correct observation that the current design for ISS isn't 
<br>
nearly as open-ended than the original &quot;Freedom&quot; design (some cool graphics 
<br>
of which I still have here in my office at home).  However, I can see how the 
<br>
existing modules can be re-arranged to allow expansion along more than one 
<br>
physical axis at some future time.  For instance, the US nodes are built to 
<br>
be pretty stout.  I could see a new pressurized truss-bearing structure being 
<br>
mounted to the nadir port of one of the nodes as a nexus for a completely new 
<br>
structure at some future time.  The then-existing ISS would serve as a 
<br>
&quot;construction shack&quot; for work on a that new structure - even one that could 
<br>
eventually be de-mated for stand-alone operation.  (Note that I agree that 
<br>
the existing structure - or even an improved one - will be too shaky to do 
<br>
meaningful astronomy.)
<br>
<p>Ultimately, though, I think a major propulsion module would have to be added 
<br>
to move the structure into a more sensible orbital inclination.  As we 
<br>
discussed recently, the 51 degree inclination - what I call the &quot;Cold War 
<br>
Delta-Vee Penalty - imposes a significant cost on getting mass up to the 
<br>
station.  Ultimately, the most sensible inclination is zero degrees and 
<br>
that's where significant space development ought to be done, absent some 
<br>
magic propulsion technology.
<br>
<p>The human element of all this is probably more important.  The hope is that 
<br>
the human capital being cultivated in the ISS program can be &quot;harvested&quot; by 
<br>
more rational programs at some future date.  Given the life-cycle of the 
<br>
current program, this could happen at any time within the next ten to 15 
<br>
years and there would still be a substantial benefit from the program as a 
<br>
training ground for talent in space development.
