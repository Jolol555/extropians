<p>Ja, and I overlooked a good way to test the routine before
<br>
anyone is entered.  Look thru the archives and collect old
<br>
posts from about 4 years ago, so that we would make up a
<br>
sort of pseudo-post-day.  The posts from back then would
<br>
be uninfluenced by the knowledge that they were being rated.
<br>
We could remove the actual names from the posts, for many
<br>
of the people who posted then are still with us.  I suspect my
<br>
own posts from 4 yrs ago are even goofier than the current
<br>
ones.  So heres the plot:
<br>
<p>1.  Get a group of posts from this day in 1996 or 1997.
<br>
<p>2.  Replace all the names with pseudonyms.
<br>
<p>3.  Everything is open for this round.  Each of the players chooses
<br>
one or more of the pseudonyms, to be this person(s) temporarily.
<br>
<p>4.  Then each person would rate all the posts in that day's
<br>
list, average the rating and enter the number in the appropriate
<br>
square.
<br>
<p>I guess we would need to choose a day in history so we
<br>
would know how many posters we have and also the number
<br>
of players.  Four have posted me offlist that they want to play.
<br>
<p>I propose 1 May 1997, since (I think) that was just before
<br>
extro3.  Was it?  Has anyone a link to some archives?  spike
