<p>I'll try :-)

<p><em>&gt;I'm responsible to my boss (have to do what he says, have to show up at

one, but
<br>

must
<br>

</em><br>
<p>You and our marvelous French extropian/cryonicist friend are exploring
<br>
what these phrases mean, and it was interesting to see how the ambiguity
<br>
derailed the discussion.  I agree with your first two examples, but not
<br>
the last one.  We would normally say that you are responsible **for** your
<br>
family (although maybe you DID mean something else?).

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then [advanced creatures] become responsible for their own evolution, 
</em><br>
<p>and Francois-Rene responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no way in which intelligence makes responsibility possible. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite on the contrary, responsibility is the very principle behind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection that made evolution possible, and that caused 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence (or at least, any trace thereof that can be found) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to appear, to begin with.
</em><br>
<p>and then Neal correctly noted that Francois-Rene was misreading
<br>
what he meant by &quot;responsible&quot;.  I'm not exactly sure what Francois-Rene
<br>
meant, but there is no doubt that the word in question is causing
<br>
confusion.  IN this case, &quot;[advanced creatures] become responsible for
<br>
their own evolution&quot; means roughly that they are in control of their
<br>
own evolution.  I'm finding it surprisingly difficult to be precise,
<br>
here, and really can't improve much on what Neal then wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay. However, I wasn't making the point you seem to think I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was. Perhaps you misunderstood my use of the word responsible.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; There's a difference between &quot;responsible for&quot; (in charge of,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is what I meant) and &quot;responsible to&quot; (an obligation).
</em><br>
<p>Alas, there is only one solution to this quagmire that I know of.
<br>
When one begins to sense that any word or phrase is causing trouble,
<br>
then one simply stops using it, at least for a while.
