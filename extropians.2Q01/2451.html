<p><p>Since I made the original inflammatory off-the-cuff remark, I should
<br>
probably justify it, rather than simply huck out the remark and then
<br>
disappear into the aether :-).  Warning, however, this is probably qualifies
<br>
as a not too well thought out, slightly disillusioned flame.
<br>
<p>My basic gripe is that the whole Slashdot community has talked big for a
<br>
long time about being a new kind of interactive community, yet in the last 6
<br>
months has decended down to approximately the level of Usenet, in terms of
<br>
cliquism, unusability, low signal-to-noise ratio, spelling flames, spam --
<br>
you name it.  And Usenet at least has been around for what, nigh on 20
<br>
years?
<br>
<p>The promises of dynamic moderation and the like have mostly gone nowhere
<br>
that is discernable, and the various sites are now mostly a collection of
<br>
what are essentially vanity pages.  They have been gobbled up by the Linux
<br>
dotcom collective, and instead of being absorbed by the body and co-opted
<br>
into a corporate arm, they have gone exactly.... nowhere.  Which just might
<br>
be worse.
<br>
<p>Now, maybe this is the generic fate of online communities.  I'm sure there
<br>
are people on this list who have done research in the area who can say one
<br>
way or the other.  And there's probably nothing wrong with that, I
<br>
suppose -- the generic rule of &quot;it's my site with my rules, and you can play
<br>
that way or leave&quot; is fine by me.  But I guess I'm getting pretty sick of
<br>
having them held up as some sort of epitome of the open source linux driven
<br>
hacker community way of doing things.  If that's what they are, then... ick!
<br>
We certainly do better than that on this list!
<br>
<p>While this probably sounds pretty bitter, I don't mean it to -- I'm not in
<br>
competition with Taco et al, I'm not in the business of online-community
<br>
making and I still have Slashdot in my favorites, for now.  But I guess I'm
<br>
burned out on the hype.
