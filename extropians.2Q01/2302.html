<p>The Human Touch

<br>
<p>DESPITE the best efforts of programmers, there are still many things
<br>
that computers just cannot do. Examples include distinguishing between
<br>
suspicious and legitimate behaviour on a corporate network, or sorting
<br>
junk e-mail from genuinely important messages, or providing detailed
<br>
answers to particular questions. For these tasks, which require
<br>
judgment, expertise and experience that cannot be easily captured in
<br>
software, some firms have adopted the unusual tactic of using people
<br>
as part of their network infrastructure. Such &quot;cyborg&quot; companies use
<br>
computers as levers for the mind, to make the most of precious human
<br>
expertise.
<br>
<p>Counterpane Internet Security, based in San Jose,
<br>
California, uses this technique to provide a
<br>
security-guard service for corporate networks. Its
<br>
founder, Bruce Schneier, realised after many years of
<br>
working as a security consultant that no network could
<br>
ever be made truly secure, no matter how much fancy
<br>
hardware and software was available. There would always
<br>
be weak spots, often caused by human failings. The best
<br>
approach to security, Mr Schneier decided, was to assume
<br>
that break-ins will occur-and to use people to spot
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Special software exists to identify network intrusions,
<br>
but once an attacker has worked out how the software
<br>
works, it can be circumvented. Human experts, on the
<br>
other hand, are harder to fool, although software is
<br>
still needed to enable a single operator to keep watch
<br>
on dozens of networks simultaneously.  Counterpane's
<br>
approach is to install &quot;sentry&quot; machines on its clients'
<br>
networks. These relay a stream of status messages to a
<br>
central secure operations centre. Human operators
<br>
sitting at consoles monitor the status of around 50
<br>
sentries at once, watching for anomalous behaviour. If
<br>
anything fishy is detected, the alarm is raised and the
<br>
client's technical staff can take appropriate action.
<br>
<p>Using highly trained people to look out for trouble has
<br>
a number of benefits. For a start, there are economies
<br>
of scale: since intrusions are rare, each operator can
<br>
watch many networks at once. This also enables operators
<br>
to spot trends that would otherwise go unnoticed-such as
<br>
a hacker using a particular style of attack on several
<br>
different networks, or aiming at firms in a particular
<br>
business (such as banking or e-commerce). And operators
<br>
can make allowances for human foibles, such as
<br>
recognising the night-shift operator with chubby fingers
<br>
who tends to mistype his password.
<br>
<p>Brightmail, based in San Francisco, also uses people to
<br>
filter information flowing across the Internet. Its
<br>
customers are Internet service providers that want to
<br>
stop junk e-mail, or &quot;spam&quot;, and messages infected with
<br>
computer viruses, before they reach their intended
<br>
recipients. This process can be automated, up to a
<br>
point, but spammers and virus-writers quickly find ways
<br>
to defeat most software filters.
<br>
<p>Brightmail's operators monitor decoy e-mail accounts,
<br>
looking for new examples of spam or viruses that can
<br>
defeat filters. When an example is found, the operators
<br>
update the filter, and the new filter is then
<br>
automatically relayed to Brightmail's customers. Since
<br>
sending out a million junk e-mails takes quite a while,
<br>
this rapid response makes it possible to detect and
<br>
destroy subsequent messages before they do any damage.
<br>
<p>The cyborg firm that comes closest to the sci-fi vision
<br>
of people plugging cables into their heads is Keen,
<br>
another San Francisco firm. Keen in effect allows
<br>
experts to rent out their brains over the Internet,
<br>
charging by the minute. Anybody can register on Keen's
<br>
website as a &quot;speaker&quot; on a particular subject, such as
<br>
computer troubleshooting, tax regulations or tarot-card
<br>
reading. Speakers specify when they are available and
<br>
set a billing rate, which averages $2 per minute.
<br>
<p>Users of Keen who are looking for answers to a
<br>
particular question choose a speaker and click a &quot;call
<br>
now&quot; button. Keen then calls both the user and the
<br>
speaker over the ordinary telephone network. Once the
<br>
call is over, the user is billed and is also invited to
<br>
give the speaker a numerical rating, which appears on
<br>
the website and helps distinguish real experts from
<br>
charlatans. Speakers pocket 70% of the call revenue;
<br>
some are earning over $2,000 a week.
<br>
<p>According to Karl Jacob, the firm's boss, Keen has been
<br>
successful-it is one of the 20 most popular Internet
<br>
merchants, and has more than 2.5m paying
<br>
customers-because people want answers from people, not
<br>
computers.  Talking to a person is better than reading
<br>
even the most detailed list of &quot;frequently asked
<br>
questions&quot;, he suggests, because it is easier to assess
<br>
the trustworthiness of the information provided and to
<br>
focus on a particular topic of interest. Keen has just
<br>
launched its service in Britain, where a MORI poll found
<br>
that nine out of ten people would rather talk to another
<br>
person when searching for expert advice than scour the
<br>
Internet. Even in the disembodied world of the web,
<br>
there is a lot to be said for the human touch.
