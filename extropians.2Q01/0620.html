<em>&gt; Like Hal, I've long thought that the one might well craft a religion
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; memetic receptor site for theological belief systems by appealling to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion that we exist in a simulation.  But I think such a religion (or, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would term it, &quot;reliberion&quot;) ought to spell out more clearly the hows and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whys of Rapture.  Here's one quick take on the matter: The entities running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our simulation do so not merely for entertainment but, more importantly, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduction.  As they quite naturally exist themselves in computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space, they generate new entities via computational means.  And just as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate our children by the same means that our parents begat us, so too the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god (or gods) hosting our simulation rely on the rough-and-tumble of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interested agents (albeit simulated ones) to give birth to new gods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our simulation thus functions something like a petri dish, and we sperm and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eggs striving to transcend it.
</em><br>
<p>Ah yes, the children of God.  Such occurred to me also.  I got in a lot
<br>
of trouble in Sunday School class when I was 10 for asking when the
<br>
&quot;children of God&quot; grow up and how they do so. :-)   
<br>
<p>Also, I think we might be in a time-loop where this period is part of
<br>
the becoming/being of God[s] which then transcend space-time and become
<br>
part of our being becoming them, if you see what I mean.  The awareness
<br>
and very being is looped upon itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One practicing the reliberion I'm describing would thus take as his or her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal growing into and thus joining the god(s) hosting the simulation we, ex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesi, now live in.  Note that this by no means ratifies prayer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-abasement, or other such humbug.  Nor does it necessarily imply outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejection of all rituals.  One would test such practices for their efficacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in promoting the goal of achieving godhood.  (As a side benefit, it bears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noting, such a reliberion, even if at best harmless, might help to block
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infection by more virulent strains of theology.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think you have a sound beginning of something that is
<br>
workable.  Add to that an ethical side of choosing the type of
<br>
super/trans/beings we which to become and releasing/transcending our
<br>
current ideational/emotional/psychological bonds that hold us back and
<br>
imprinting new patterns and I think you have most of what is needed.  
<br>
<p>I further think that such a religion might well safe us from a
<br>
tremendous amount of pain, unrootedness and random, increasingly
<br>
powerful collisions of differing goal/belief systems as we head toward
<br>
Singularity.  It might we form a core appealing to both spiritual and
<br>
scientific aspects and people and a crucial point of unity.
