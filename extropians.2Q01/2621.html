<p>
I'm not going to quote the messages because it isn't worth the
<br>
time.  But Ben Goertzel and Mitchel J. Porter are &quot;pitching&quot;
<br>
the concept that Quantum Mechanics is involved in 'consciousness'
<br>
or the 'theories of the mind'.  I believe a recent paper in
<br>
Science has completely disproven the classical 'Penrosian'
<br>
perspective in this area because the 'noise' in the mind
<br>
far exceeds the quantum mechanical effects.
<br>
<p>While I agree with Ben's perspective that &quot;chaos&quot; may have
<br>
some influence, it is happening *FAR* above the quantum
<br>
level (just as a butterfly flapping its wings is *far*
<br>
above the quantum level) -- It is probably at the level of 'mis'-copying
<br>
or the subtle influence of 'nearby' neuronal patterns.  Until you
<br>
come up with some premise for aspects of the 'mind' that ARE *not*
<br>
explained by Calvin's Darwinian mating/copying/selection perspective
<br>
then, may we *please* presume that normal physics is completely
<br>
sufficient without having to delve into the QM realm?
<br>
<p>We need an Extropian &quot;bogosity&quot; hurdle that requires individuals
<br>
to have a concrete explanation for how something 10 or 20
<br>
orders of magnitude less singificant can 'rise' to significance
<br>
before the suggestions are taken seriously.
