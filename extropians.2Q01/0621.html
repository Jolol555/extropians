<em>&gt; It wasn't clear to me in my original reading of the post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that AAR was coming out against the quotes in Steve's letter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can find a pointer to the cleaned up letter and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further references under:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/LongevityPolitics/index.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/LongevityPolitics/index.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, one should be very careful when one argues these areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (instead of having a knee jerk response that quotes taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of context are designed to generate).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, even I would argue that spending huge amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money on medical treatments for people in the last year of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their life is a complete waste and such funds could be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better used making micro-loans in third world banks.  Many more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives would be saved.
</em><br>
<p>First, it depends on whose funds they are.  Second, these medical
<br>
treatments often push the state of the art in medicine which has a
<br>
direct effect on the health and longevity of the population.  Third,
<br>
micro-loans may or may not be a good thing in local third world
<br>
economies but they are not necessarily more likely to change the state
<br>
of our knowledge and overall abilities.  Without changes to our overall
<br>
abilities concerning longetivity and human wellbeing and enhancement a
<br>
few micro-loans more or less won't make much real difference.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Callahan has done a lot of research into the misapplication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of funds in medical care.  His positions are based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning to make rational tradeoffs on the allocation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarce resources.   Chapman is making a reasonable moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument that I would agree has strong merits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What &quot;scarce resources&quot;?  Belonging to whom?  On what basis?
<br>
Distributable by whom?  Why? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If one condition were met, I would agree with these two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indivduals -- &quot;that we knew for a fact that the indefinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension of human life is impossible&quot;!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A lot depends on what is meant by &quot;human life&quot;.  With full medical MNT
<br>
there is no reason I am aware of why indefinite extension is not
<br>
possible.  Personally I would want to change from the standard human
<br>
form after a few dozen decades though. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If that statement could be proven true, then their positions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be entirely defensible.  But because it cannot be
</em><br>
<p>Of course it can't be &quot;proven true&quot; because that would require proving
<br>
the limits of all possible future technologies which is clearly
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; proven true, then one has a triangle shaped-slippery slope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Up until the point that you know you can indefinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend the lifespan, allocating resources for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the end of their lives is a waste relative to allocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to people at the beginning of their lives.
</em><br>
<p>Says who?  This does not follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However as soon as it becomes relatively clear that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sea-saw is about to flip, it becomes a totally different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture.  Resolving the question of what fraction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your resources should be devoted to accellerating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day when the paradigm flips is a very difficult question.
</em><br>
<p>Whose resources?  Why is it difficult?  If I decide to invest my funds
<br>
in one direction or the other then why is it anyone else's issue or
<br>
business how I invest my funds and energy?  It seems to me that a lot of
<br>
the &quot;difficult question&quot; comes from assuming that we are speaking of
<br>
some public pot of funds and resources to be administered by some
<br>
bureaucracy.  Perhaps the difficulty grows as much or more from that
<br>
assumption and form of decision making in and of itself than the type of
<br>
decisions and choices we are talking about.
