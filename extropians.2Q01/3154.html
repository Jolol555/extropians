<p>This was not intended towards you or anyone else who makes relevant,
<br>
actual-information-containing, interesting, etc. posts to this list.

<p><em>&gt; Now I'm more inclined to shake my head at the crude attempt to use

</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately some people here if left to such &quot;light touch&quot; methods do
<br>
not respond; rather they take it as an opening to push the envelope
<br>
further and further. And they tend to end up drawing in other people
<br>
with similar views. If left unchecked, this ends up turning the whole
<br>
list into mediocrity. So sorry if someone had to finally say something
<br>
loud enough to hear, but if it cleans things up a bit then mission
<br>
accomplished.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have never, in fact, called myself either an extropian or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian, and I think one of the great things about this list is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's not necessary for me to do so in order to post here.  If I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sign something equivalent to the Thirty-Nine Articles in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participate here, I'd be gone.
</em><br>
<p>Right-o. I have no problem with non-extropians posting here- what I have
<br>
a problem with is people who come here simply to insult us, attack us in
<br>
a troll-like fashion (not interested in actual debate), or who simply
<br>
have read so little of this list's past that they repeatedly rehash old
<br>
old old issues while adding nothing new. I can't fully fault people on
<br>
the last part since the list archives are hard to search currently.
<br>
<p>&lt;rest snipped for Eliezer to respond to&gt;
