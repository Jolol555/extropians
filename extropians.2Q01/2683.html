<em>&gt; &gt; Let me tell you a little secret about the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world (as opposed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anarchist, socialist world).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Capitalism prevails because it allows players to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a real and palpable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stake in the game. That's why the US government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourages citizens to own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their own homes. Private ownership stabilizes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system by giving people a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason *not* to riot, rebel, and revolt. Take away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private ownership, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people have nothing to lose by burning down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood (or the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; country for that matter). Anarchism is a nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal, but it just doesn't pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the mortgage, and it never will.
</em><br>
<p>You have the situation hopelessly reversed.  In an
<br>
anarchistic society, people have much greater control
<br>
over their own lives and workplace, and are therefore
<br>
much less likely to want to destroy them.  It is the
<br>
capitalistic system that is not stable.  Notice there
<br>
have been quite a number of riots, rebelions, and
<br>
revolts as of late.  The events in Seattle not too
<br>
long ago had a significant anti-capitalist bent to
<br>
them, as will the events this weekend in Quebec City. 
<br>
(Keep checking here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.infoshop.org/octo/ftaa_news.html">http://www.infoshop.org/octo/ftaa_news.html</a>  for
<br>
updates on the action.)
<br>
<p>More below...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I've always found anarchism to be compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a romantic ideal, it just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't make it in the world we find ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living in. Maybe someday it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will. Who knows? Even if we don't subscribe to it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ideology, I think there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a lot we can learn from anarchist writers (I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kropotkin). But then, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel that way about most things, and am not easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converted (I tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assimilate and/or synthesize what I need). For an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent examination of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an anarchist society might actually look (warts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all), I would heartily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recommend Ursula K. Le Guin's novel THE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DISPOSSESSED, which was originally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; published in 1974. I recently reread it after many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, and her critique of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both anarchism and capitalism still rings true. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's a great novel (IMHO).

<p>I point people to the FAQ again for an example of how
<br>
anarchism really did work in practice during the
<br>
Spanish Civil War, until it was largely destroyed by
<br>
the fascist Franco:
<br>
<p>I.8 Does revolutionary Spain show that libertarian
<br>
socialism can work in practice?
<br>

<br>
<p>In Spain there is also the Mondragon Co-operative
<br>
Federation which has definite anarchistic qualities. 
<br>
The federation has consistently outperformed
<br>
surrounding capitalist industry and grosses billions
<br>
in revenue yearly:

<br>
<p>Also, in the US, there is a company called W.L. Gore &amp;
<br>
Associates.  They are structured in a non-hierarchical
<br>
manner, much like one would see in an anarchistic
<br>
society (though I'm unaware of whether or not its
<br>
founder knew anything of anarchism).  They gross over
<br>
a billion dollars a year.  A quote from their company
<br>
homepage:

How we work sets us apart. At Gore, we don't tax
creativity with conventional hierarchy. We encourage
hands-on innovation and discourage bureaucracy,
involving those closest to a project in decision
making. Teams organize around opportunities and
leaders emerge. Instead of a pyramid of bosses and
managers, Bill Gore created a flat lattice
organization. There are no chains of command, no
pre-determined channels of communication. Instead, we
communicate directly with each other and are
accountable to fellow members of our multi-disciplined
teams.
