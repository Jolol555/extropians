<p>Lawrence Schulman claims that it is possible to have opposite-running-time
<br>
regions and that ³some² degree of contact between them will not destroy the
<br>
arrows of time. 
<br>
In the same way that electrons and positrons run in opposite time
<br>
directions, there are - Schulman suggests - galaxies with backward-running
<br>
time, following the timeline from Crunch to Bang.
<br>
At this instant they are, perhaps, very old and hence not very luminous,
<br>
although they are still exerting a gravitational pull.
<br>
I do not know whether, or not, &quot;some&quot; interaction between these
<br>
opposite-running-time regions, or galaxies, or universes, could ensure the
<br>
infinite computing power. Maybe.
<br>
<p>A compromised arrow of time
<br>
L. S. Schulman
<br>
The second law of thermodynamics - the usual statement of the arrow of time
<br>
- has been called the most fundamental law of physics. It is thus difficult
<br>
to conceive that a single dynamical system could contain subsystems, in
<br>
significant mutual contact, possessing opposite thermodynamic arrows of
<br>
time. By examining cosmological justification for the usual arrow it is
<br>
found that a consistent way to establish such justification is by giving
<br>
symmetric boundary conditions at two (cosmologically remote) times and
<br>
seeking directional behavior in between. Once this has been demonstrated, it
<br>
is seen that entropy increase can be reversed and that the usual arrow is
<br>
less totalitarian than previously believed. In the same vein, other boundary
<br>
conditions, modeling shorter periods in the evolution of the cosmos, can be
<br>
found that allow the simultaneous existence of two thermodynamic arrows,
<br>
notwithstanding moderate interaction between the systems possessing those
<br>
arrows. Physical consequences of the existence and detection of
<br>
opposite-arrow regions are also considered.

<p>Opposite Thermodynamic Arrows of Time
<br>
L. S. Schulman
<br>
A model in which two weakly coupled systems maintain opposite running
<br>
thermodynamic arrows of time is exhibited. Each experiences its own retarded
<br>
electromagnetic interaction and can be seen by the other. The possibility of
<br>
opposite-arrow systems at stellar distances is explored and a relation to
<br>
dark matter suggested.
