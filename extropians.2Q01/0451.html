Hello,
<br>
<p>I guess this is an open question or simply a statement of what is on my
<br>
mind.  I hope that I am not repeating what people have already discussed.
<br>
<p>Sometimes I think that half the world experienced a singularity like event a
<br>
few centuries ago and has been trying to catch up ever since.  I guess I am
<br>
referring to radical cultural innovations of the past such as those that
<br>
created the science &amp; technology focused Western civilization.
<br>
<p>During colonization of the 1800's don't you think the inhabitants of many of
<br>
the exploited territories felt like they missed some singularity like event?
<br>
<p>Below is an old article from the Economist about technological divisions in
<br>
the world that I found interesting.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

A new map of the world
<br>
Today's world is divided not by ideology but by technology.
<br>
<p>WITH the end of the cold war, old ideological divisions are over. Virtually
<br>
all nations proclaim allegiance to global markets. But a more intractable
<br>
division is taking hold, this time based on technology. A small part of the
<br>
globe, accounting for some 15% of the earth's population, provides nearly
<br>
all of the world's technology innovations. A second part, involving perhaps
<br>
half of the world's population, is able to adopt these technologies in
<br>
production and consumption. The remaining part, covering around a third of
<br>
the world's population, is technologically disconnected, neither innovating
<br>
at home nor adopting foreign technologies.
