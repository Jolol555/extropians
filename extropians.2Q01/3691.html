<em>&gt; &gt; In tournament chess, there is a thing called an Elo rating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that describes one's strength.  Sasha may have had this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in mind when he proposed his system ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders Sandberg wrote: When you get more energy, could you explain how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Elo ratings are calculated?
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  For now, lets show how to use an Elo-like system for
<br>
our extropian rating average (ERA).  We would make a
<br>
matrix with the names in the first column and across the
<br>
first row.  Excel is a great tool for this purpose, since in calculating
<br>
averages it ignores blank cells.  Consider the matrix (which
<br>
I hope will scale) containing 4 extropian posters, Les Min, Uther
<br>
Pundragon, Somber Sam and Nancy Newby.  All persons enter
<br>
themselves into matrix by choice, as is appropriate for a liberty
<br>
loving bunch.
<br>
<p>The person goes down the list and rates the other ERA-ers
<br>
on a scale from -2 to 5, where -2 = killfile, 5 = take the
<br>
computer along on your honeymoon in hopes that the 5-er
<br>
has posted some jewel of wisdom you cant live without, a true
<br>
Sasha Chislenko clone.
<br>
<p>Now heres the tricky part.  A zero is not the same as a blank
<br>
and it matters: If you are neutral to a known person, you give the
<br>
person a 0, but if you know nothing about a person, you
<br>
leave the cell blank.  A new person to the matrix should likely
<br>
have a lot of blanks.  I specifically set this scale unsymmetrically to
<br>
make it come out this way.  If a newby comes on the matrix and
<br>
posts one thing that you know nothing about, the newby would
<br>
get from you a 0.  This is not an insult at all, its neutral.  Otherwise
<br>
we would get ERA inflation, since people that hang out here
<br>
generally like each other, eh?
<br>
<p>Lets try this matrix and hope it doesnt get messed up with
<br>
the font change in the email program Im using:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;les min    pundragon   sam    nancy    ERA
<br>
les min                    1.5                             0        1
<br>
uther pundragon     1                2.5        -1        2
<br>
somber sam            2                2            .33    3
<br>
nancy newby                            3            2        2
<br>
<p>Nowthen in the cells along the main diagonal is the average
<br>
of the ratings one gave the others, so for instance Pundragon
<br>
gave Sam a 2 and Nancy a 3, but doesn't know anything about
<br>
Les, so his rating average that Pundragon gave out is 2.5.
<br>
<p>In the last column, the ERA, is the average of what others in
<br>
the matrix think of you.  Again blanks don't count, and your
<br>
own rating average is not part of this average.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;les min    pundragon   sam    nancy    ERA
<br>
les min                1.5                              0

<br>
uther pundragon     1                2.5        -1        2            .67
<br>
somber sam            2                2            .33    3
<br>
2.33
<br>
nancy newby                            3            2        2
<br>
2.5
<br>
<p>See how that works?  OK heres the part I think is a
<br>
new contribution on the part of moi.  We are going to
<br>
derive another column, called the weighted ERA which
<br>
will be in some ways analogous to the chess Elo rating.
<br>
In chess, if you mop up the cannon fodder, your own
<br>
rating doesn't go up much, but if you manage to behead
<br>
a master you get major Elo points.  *In our weighted ERA
<br>
column, we will multiply the ratings each person gives us
<br>
by their own ERA and scale it by their average rating.*
<br>
<p>For instance, when Nancy first joins the matrix, all of
<br>
her row is blank, since no one knows her.  Her ERA
<br>
defaults to zero.  She can scan the archives and rate
<br>
everyone in there, but her own rating is zip.  Nowthen,
<br>
in the scaled ERA column, we multiply the ERA by
<br>
the rating the person gives.  So when nancy first
<br>
starts, she can rate everyone anything she wants
<br>
and it has no effect on anyone's scaled ERA since
<br>
her own ERA is 0.
<br>
<p>Secondly, when calculating the scaled ERA, we
<br>
force everyone's average rating of others to a
<br>
value equal to one's own ERA.  Nancy is new
<br>
and loves everybody, so she gives out a lot of
<br>
4s and 5s.  Then suppose Sombre Sam gets in a
<br>
flame war and several people jump on him and
<br>
he thinks the whole world is against him.  He rates
<br>
everyone a -1 or -2.  In both cases we scale the
<br>
average rating that they gave out to equal their
<br>
own unscaled ERA.
<br>
<p>What this does is in these cases, Nancy may be
<br>
making uninformed decisions, so her influence
<br>
on other's Scaled ERA is minimimized until she
<br>
herself posts some stuff allowing others to evaluate
<br>
her.  In Sam's case his own ERA may well go
<br>
negative since flamewars are distasteful things and
<br>
reputations suffer on both sides.  He rated others
<br>
negatively, so the product of his negative rating
<br>
and this unscaled ERA is positive.  So it may actually
<br>
raise your own scaled ERA to be flamed by a nasty troll.
<br>
<p>Pundragon is one who treats words as playthings
<br>
but seldom has anything meaty to say.  On the
<br>
other hand, he is a decent chap and occasionally
<br>
posts something that makes you laugh like a
<br>
drunken hyena.  He gets a middling positive ERA
<br>
influence level.  I figure there is nothing wrong with
<br>
being a clown, so long as you are a funny one.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, remember that this is just a game, and
<br>
you will not be placed in the matrix unless you ask
<br>
to be in it.  Should we mask individual's ratings to
<br>
keep them secret?  Or just people's ratings of each
<br>
other?  How would you do it, set up a website?  Then
<br>
each person would have a password that would
<br>
allow them to see and change their own column
<br>
only?  I can write the scaling formulae if someone
<br>
can set up a website.
<br>
<p>Who wants to play?  I do!  Anders?  Brian?
