<em>&gt; Hmm...if you could make the mass driver and power supply light enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a significant challenge, no doubt),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what about doing the reverse?  
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Standard Idea Question: So, what obvious fallacy am I missing in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above?  ^_^;
</em><br>
<p>None. Bear in mind that if you are trying to move an entire asteroid and
<br>
are not in a hurry, mass drivers ought to work well, and the weight is
<br>
not as much of a concern.
<br>
<p>Both mass drivers as propulsion and mass drivers as raw materials
<br>
transport have been in the literature for something like two decades, at
<br>
least. They seem to work well, if energy is cheap.
