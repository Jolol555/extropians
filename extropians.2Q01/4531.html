<p>You can grow nematodes in a fermenter up to kg scale. They're
<br>
pretty complex in my book. The point is not complexity, the
<br>
point is availability of nutrients being the bottleneck for
<br>
growth when you want houses to grow from acorns in the field.
<br>
There's not all that much energy and nutrient density available
<br>
in the field. Plus, there are parasites. What do you do if your
<br>
house seedling gets a bad case of mycoplasma? Do you want your
<br>
construction people to daily look out for nitrogen and 
<br>
microelements in the soil, and see that the bark doesn't get 
<br>
infested with wood bugs?
<br>
<p>Then rather give me the photosynthetic mat on your houseroof
<br>
which secretes methanol down a tendril leading into a subterraneous
<br>
tank.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that they're simple is essential to fast growth in

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; There's no threshold in structural complexity.  You can and do
</em><br>
<p>No, but there's a threshold in our knowledge and manipulability 
<br>
of complexity. As of 2001, we're still stumbling in the mist 
<br>
without a clue. I need to know the structure production and
<br>
addressing code in the dog if I want to make a sixlegged  
<br>
canine (provided I would want to make myself guilty of dire
<br>
pointless stupidity and needless cruelty to a higher animal).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; have structure at any size and any degree of precision.  We can
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Of course, we have hardly started yet. In many cases we haven't
<br>
even gotten sequence, and sequence is the first step towards
<br>
structure, which is the first step towards interaction, which is
<br>
the first step towards emergence. And the macroscale stuff and
<br>
change in stuff is pure emergence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; inch would have to be recognized and communicated across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism and we don't have anything like that in plants.
</em><br>
<p>Biology can make structural patterns on whale scale. That seems
<br>
to be sufficient for a house.
<br>
<p>Of course, the real approach is: if you think you need a house,
<br>
you're doing something wrong. If you want to live in a hard vacuum
<br>
as your native habitat, biology is clearly not the answer. Canned
<br>
monkeys can only be the first, bungling step. Planetary surfaces
<br>
are negligable. Whatever we're doing down here is not going to be
<br>
of any relevance whatsoever.
