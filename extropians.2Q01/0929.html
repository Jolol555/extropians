In fact Samantha, you can go a bit further.  Using Shannon's Information
<br>
Theory laws, you can predict that after you have squeezed out the last bit
<br>
of information capacity of your information carrier it *should* look or sound
<br>
like &quot;noise&quot;.
<br>
<p>An example of this is the evolution of modem technology.  Back when we used
<br>
to use 1200 baud modems (I know some of you remember those days), you could
<br>
listen to the modem &quot;talk&quot;, now you can only listen to it &quot;hiss&quot; because
<br>
the information is now encoded at the limits of the carrier.
<br>
<p>If our simulators are operating at the scale level proposed by the string
<br>
theorists then they are phenomenally off the scale that they have granted
<br>
us to work with.  In this &quot;universe&quot; producing the &quot;random&quot; results with wierd
<br>
coherences (that are the properties of quantum mechanics) as the simulator
<br>
&quot;manages&quot; the reality does not seem out of the question to me.
<br>
<p>Finally, I'll simply note that Minsky pointed out almost 30 years ago to
<br>
the SETI researchers that advanced aliens would take full advantage of
<br>
their bandwidth and information packing technologies -- their signals
<br>
should therefore appear to be noise.  Whether we have any ability to
<br>
detect this should we be sitting in the path of dozens of these signals
<br>
isn't clear to me.  (The assumption by the SETI researchers in most cases
<br>
is that they will try to make the signal &quot;visible&quot; to us.)
