<p>Well, I'll go along with J. Goard here.  The advocates of Spearman's &quot;g&quot;,
<br>
(for general intelligence), have been gathering data for the belief in
<br>
a mostly-single intelligence far longer than just the last few decades.
<br>
The overwhelming single fact about all the intelligence tests is that
<br>
high scores on one **always** predict a high score on the others.  But
<br>
this also jibes with one's personal experience: you mostly know, after
<br>
just a few minutes conversation, how intelligent someone is (be honest).
<br>
Of course there are exceptions, and of course there are variations, but
<br>
on the whole this fits very well with the &quot;traditional&quot; view of IQ.
