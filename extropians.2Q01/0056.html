This story is interesting in itself, but also especially for the comment
<br>
made by one of the principal researchers: &quot;It is not the objective to go
<br>
make mice with human brains,'' Weissman said. ``(But) it is in the domain
<br>
of the ethicists, not the experimenters, to figure out what our limits are.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;This kind of statement REALLY bugs me.  I can understand why, for &quot;political&quot;
<br>
reasons, biotech researchers say these kinds of things these days.  They
<br>
want to make a monkey-bow to supposed authorities outside of the scientific
<br>
enterprise to assuage people's fears of the Frankenstein archetype.  It
<br>
also will be a practical way to simply not have to spend a lot of time with
<br>
reporters answering questions the scientist may feel aren't the best use
<br>
of her time.  But, to the extent that it reflects a real defference to &quot;ethicists&quot;,
<br>
I feel it represents a kind of moral and general philosophical cowardice
<br>
on the part of the people doing this kind of work, which ultimately fuels
<br>
a mistrust of the entire enterprise by non-technical people.

U.S. Scientists Craft Mouse with Human Brain Cells 
<br>
<p>By Andrew Quinn
<br>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. researchers have produced laboratory mice
<br>
with human brain cells, marking a potential step toward developing treatments
<br>
for human brain disease like Alzheimer's but promising to fuel fresh debate
<br>
over the evolving ethics of bioengineering.
<br>
<p>The research at California biotechnology company StemCells Inc. breaks new
<br>
ground by demonstrating that human brain stem cells can be induced to grow
<br>
within a mouse's skull, scientists said on Friday.
<br>
<p>``We are not recreating a human brain. We're really just trying to understand
<br>
how these stem cells can function, and how they can be used in the treatment
<br>
of specific diseases,'' said Ann Tsukamoto, vice president of scientific
<br>
operations at StemCells Inc.
<br>
<p>Irving Weissman, a Stanford university professor involved in the two-year
<br>
research project, said the next step could be to produce mice with brains
<br>
made up almost entirely of human cells -- although he said there would have
<br>
to be a thorough ethical review before this step is taken.
<br>
<p>``You would want to ask the ethicist what percentage of the brain would
<br>
be human cells before you start worrying, and if you start worrying, what
<br>
would you start worrying about,'' Weissman said.
<br>
<p>The California study involved isolating human stem cells in the laboratory
<br>
and then introducing them into mice. As the mice matured, the human stem
<br>
cells -- ``master cells'' that can develop into any other type of cell --
<br>
grew into a full range of specialized cells throughout each mouse brain.
<br>
<p>``It looks like human cells can follow the developmental instructions put
<br>
in by the mouse brain. They are making human components in what is clearly
<br>
a mouse brain,'' Weissman said.
<br>
<p>The researchers believe that these mice could be used to test treatments
<br>
for human brain diseases such as Parkinsons and Alzheimer's, although these
<br>
tests have not yet been undertaken.
<br>
<p>Tsukamoto added that the experiment also demonstrated that StemCell Inc's
<br>
process for isolating and developing human stem cells was viable, and that
<br>
cell banks could be established for future transplantation into humans.
<br>
<p>``We're of course moving this into the development phase, and looking at
<br>
which disease indications these cells would be best used for in preclinical
<br>
trials,'' she said.
<br>
<p>Both scientists stressed that their research, while marking a new breakthrough
<br>
in the controversial world of stem cell research, was in no way aimed at
<br>
blurring the lines between human and animal.
<br>
<p>But Weissman added that he had already requested a review panel to look
<br>
at the research to determine if there may be ethical problems in taking
<br>
the work further.
<br>
<p>``It is not the objective to go make mice with human brains,'' Weissman
<br>
said. ``(But) it is in the domain of the ethicists, not the experimenters,
<br>
to figure out what our limits are.''
