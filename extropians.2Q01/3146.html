Artificial Lung On The Horizon, Reports University Of Pittsburgh Researcher 
<br>
At International Society For Heart And Lung Transplantation Meeting 
<br>
VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, April 26 -- A University of Pittsburgh 
<br>
researcher who has developed a device that functions like a temporary set of 
<br>
lungs told a group of heart and lung transplant surgeons today that such 
<br>
technology could have a tremendous impact for the nearly 750,000 patients 
<br>
with emphysema, chest trauma or acute respiratory distress, about 150,000 of 
<br>
whom die each year. A potential application also exists for military 
<br>
personnel and civilians who may become victims of chemical warfare or 
<br>
terrorist attack involving toxic gases, he reported. In an invited keynote 
<br>
lecture at the 21st Annual Meeting of the International Society for Heart and 
<br>
Lung Transplantation, Brack Hattler, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of surgery at 
<br>
the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said laboratory and animal 
<br>
studies suggest the device could do an adequate job of exchanging carbon 
<br>
dioxide and oxygen in patients with compromised lungs, allowing the lungs to 
<br>
rest and heal. &quot;It's an alternative means of breathing,&quot; stated Dr. Hattler. 
<br>
A clinical trial of the device, called the Hattler Respiratory Catheter, is 
<br>
expected to begin in Europe in about a year. It will be only the second time 
<br>
an implantable artificial lung has been tested in humans. About 10 years ago, 
<br>
clinical testing of another device was halted because the device's design did 
<br>
not allow for sufficient gas exchange. In general, progress to develop an 
<br>
artificial lung lags years behind that of the artificial kidney, liver and 
<br>
heart. &quot;The artificial lung especially has lingered behind progress with 
<br>
artificial hearts and ventricular assist devices, not because the need for 
<br>
lungs has not been recognized, but because we have not had a full 
<br>
understanding of the engineering problems and the unique material 
<br>
requirements until recent years,&quot; explained Dr. Hattler, who has devoted the 
<br>
past 14 years to the development of an artificial lung. Together with 
<br>
bioengineer William J. Federspiel, Ph.D., Dr. Hattler has created an 
<br>
intravenous respiratory assist device that is easily inserted through a vein 
<br>
in the leg and positioned into the vena cava, the major vein returning blood 
<br>
to the heart. It consists of hollow fiber membranes that introduce oxygen 
<br>
into and remove carbon dioxide from the body. Key to its design, and a 
<br>
distinction from the device that failed, is a central balloon within the 
<br>
fibers that can inflate and deflate at a rate of 300 beats per minute to move 
<br>
the fibers and mix the blood. This allows for more efficient oxygenation of 
<br>
blood and removal of carbon dioxide. In essence, respiration takes place even 
<br>
though the lungs are severely injured and functioning poorly. The surface 
<br>
area of two lungs is about the size of a tennis court. The Hattler Catheter 
<br>
has a surface area equivalent to an 8½ x 11 sheet of paper and can perform 
<br>
about 50 percent of the gas exchange requirements of an adult. Blood is 
<br>
exposed to a tiny amount of foreign biomaterial -- less than a half a square 
<br>
meter -- minimizing the likelihood that there would be an infection or 
<br>
clotting caused by the interaction between blood and a synthetic surface, Dr. 
<br>
Hattler reported. Because the Hattler Catheter is intended to temporarily 
<br>
take over the function of the lungs, giving them time to heal, it could meet 
<br>
a dire need for patients with acute respiratory failure, such as those with 
<br>
emphysema, or those who have suffered trauma to the lungs. Currently, the 
<br>
standard of care is the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenators, bulky and 
<br>
expensive units that can cause life-threatening complications and death in 
<br>
more than half of those who are treated with them. The device is not 
<br>
envisioned to be used for prolonged support, say as a bridge to transplant, 
<br>
or as a total replacement of the lungs. However, findings from the clinical 
<br>
trial will lead to a greater understanding of what is required for the 
<br>
development of more long-term devices, Dr. Hattler said, enabling a 
<br>
jump-start for artificial lung researchers who are working to develop devices 
<br>
to provide long-term support for patients awaiting lung transplantation. 
<br>
About 25 percent of these patients die on the waiting list, in large part 
<br>
because no means of support currently exists. Such devices, which are about 
<br>
two to three years from human testing, would need to be surgically implanted. 
<br>
Support for Dr. Hattler's research has been provided through grants from the 
<br>
U.S. Department of Defense. Work has been conducted through the University of 
<br>
Pittsburgh McGowan Center for Artificial Organ Development. Alung 
<br>
Technologies is a Pittsburgh-based company specifically created to enable the 
<br>
clinical phase of research.
