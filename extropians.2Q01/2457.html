<p>Okay, so neurosurgery is too hard, let's do nano? Thanks for a laugh, I
<br>
really needed one today ;)

<p><em>&gt; surgery is one of course.  Another might be some form of deep memory

<p>Of course, medical nanotechnology is significantly harder the one churning
<br>
raw computronium out by the mole. Mature nanotechnology is thus incompatible
<br>
with continued existance of meat people, and hence makes speculations about
<br>
nontrivial CNS I/O implants seem like rather like a treatment on the 
<br>
molecular structure of the unicorn's horn, or cryptozoology proceedings 
<br>
on the applied proteomics of the common mermaid.

<p>If you're willing to live docked inside a massive, expensive device,
<br>
sure. (I don't want to see your bills for teleoperation, though).
<br>
The bitrates you can get from noninvasive imaging are rather low,
<br>
unfortunately. The technology can't provide an all-resolving fix
<br>
to an ultimately physical problem. As long as you mince around the
<br>
perimeter you'll never get a good lock at what's happening inside.

</em><br>
<p>Um, have you ever lived with a skin portal of any kind? Have you ever
<br>
asked your health insurance whether they finance frivolous multielectrode
<br>
grid implants?
<br>

<em>&gt; In the meantime much of the necessary software can be built and field

</em><br>
<p>Wearables and augmented reality will indeed become very big, and precisely
<br>
because they don't require any messy brain surgery nor Ragnar0k-class 
<br>
technology like molecular manufacturing.
