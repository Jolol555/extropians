<p>The Hot New Medium: Paper
<br>
<p>How the oldest interface in the book is redrawing the map of the
<br>
networked world.
<br>
<p>By Steve Silberman
<br>
<p>They're building something enormous at a research park outside of Lund,
<br>
Sweden. Like any concept that eventually becomes the standard by which
<br>
imagination is measured, it started out small and grew as its creators
<br>
came to understand the scale of what they were making. Now it's half as
<br>
big as the United States.
<br>
<p>By dawn - which means midmorning in winter at this latitude - the
<br>
bulldozers have already been roaring for hours, churning mountains out of
<br>
the red, muddy soil, forcing drivers to improvise roads over the fresh
<br>
muck. The chaos of construction is not unusual here. The wireless boom in
<br>
Europe and Asia is bringing dozens of new office buildings to research
<br>
parks like this one all over Scandinavia, from startups incubated as
<br>
student projects, to established firms poised to surf the wave of
<br>
personal-area-network devices that will wash ashore in the next couple
<br>
of years. Even more ambitious, however, is the project taking shape in a
<br>
cluttered second-floor office known as the monkey cage by the engineers
<br>
and programmers who work there.
<br>
<p>As Christer Fåhraeus tries to describe the magnitude of what he and his
<br>
team are designing, his fingers dance with a pen across a sheet of paper.
<br>
A compact, straw-haired, 35-year-old Swede, Fåhraeus gives off the aura of
<br>
a tensely coiled spring. In Swedish or English, he speaks staccato, as if
<br>
there were too many ideas backing up behind the frustratingly slow buffer
<br>
of syntax. To relieve the pressure inside him, he sketches arrows,
<br>
rectangles, and intersections that form the true arc of his thoughts.
<br>
Words come secondarily to him, Fåhraeus tells me - his brain thinks in
<br>
images. He holds up the paper.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the most advanced digital input screen ever developed,&quot; he
<br>
declares. &quot;It has very high resolution, perfect contrast, and costs a
<br>
fraction of a cent to produce. Any graphical interface can be printed on
<br>
it,
<br>
and you get years of full-time education, paid for by the government, to
<br>
learn how to use it. It will not be beaten in our lifetime.&quot;
<br>
<p>He puts the paper in my hands. &quot;And I can give it to you, because I have
<br>
hundreds more,&quot; he offers, gesturing toward a stack of blank paper on
<br>
his desk. Fåhraeus isn't handing me a sketch of the input screen. The
<br>
paper is the screen.
<br>
<p>That's what they're building at Anoto, the company Fåhraeus launched a
<br>
year and a half ago beside this muddy field near the southwestern tip of
<br>
Sweden: a network that can transform millions of sheets of paper into a
<br>
new front end for the Internet.
<br>
<p><p>By the end of this year, Ericsson will bring to market a pudgy-looking
<br>
ballpoint called the Chatpen. It will be the first of a new breed of
<br>
writing instrument invented by Anoto that will allow you to send email and
<br>
faxes directly on paper, with no personal computer or wireless tablet in
<br>
sight. You'll be able to jot these messages down on business cards, legal
<br>
pads, or company letterhead. To send a message, you'll simply check a box
<br>
for &quot;Send as email&quot; or &quot;Send as fax&quot; that's printed in the corner of the
<br>
paper. Marking other boxes will route your message to pagers or mobile
<br>
phones. A single scribbled note will trigger a cascade of networked
<br>
events:  Jotting down a lunch date in your day planner could update your
<br>
laptop and fire off an email to your assistant.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are three fundamental technologies for gathering, storing, and
<br>
spreading information - voice, computer, and paper and pen,&quot; Fåhraeus
<br>
declares, drawing three squares on the paper and methodically checking
<br>
them off. &quot;Now we make this one digital and wireless, like the others.&quot; By
<br>
closing the gap between paper and the digital domain, Anoto is planning
<br>
to put the convenience and speed of the Net behind an interface that
<br>
was debugged thousands of years ago.
<br>
<p>&quot;If we succeed,&quot; he adds, &quot;we will have more product coverage than any
<br>
other company on earth.&quot;
<br>
<p>If his network rolls out as scheduled, within a year you'll be able to
<br>
make a check mark beside a magazine ad to receive information about a
<br>
product, or even to buy it. Visualize ecommerce without the
<br>
click-and-wait: Browsing through a printed catalog, you'll purchase items
<br>
- software, a subwoofer, or a trip to Paris - by ticking them off with a
<br>
pen. Circling your destination on a city map will display, on your
<br>
PalmPilot or mobile phone, the quickest route from here to there, movie
<br>
showtimes, or tonight's menu at the best bistros in the area.
<br>
<p>To do these things, you'll need an instrument like the Chatpen that
<br>
contains technology developed by Anoto. (By 2003, other Anoto-enabled
<br>
pens, including Pilot rollerballs and a characteristically elegant
<br>
offering from Montblanc, will be available.) You'll also need a supply of
<br>
the special paper that Anoto has christened digital paper. It won't be
<br>
hard to find, and it won't cost much more than standard copy stock. Unlike
<br>
Xerox PARC's electronic paper or MIT/E Ink's Immedia, Anoto's technology
<br>
employs real paper and commonly available inks. By the time Chatpens
<br>
appear in office-supply shops and mail-order catalogs this fall, digital
<br>
paper sporting the Anoto logo will be turning up everywhere. This global
<br>
rollout will be branded with the most recognizable names in the
<br>
office-products industry. You'll be able to buy digital Cambridge legal
<br>
pads, digital At-A-Glance organizers, digital Financial Times diaries, and
<br>
digital Franklin planners handsomely bound in leather. This winter, expect
<br>
flurries of digital 3M Post-it Notes.
<br>
<p>At Comdex 2000 last fall, the buzz was that some Swedish startup (or
<br>
Japanese; the name of the company, which does sound vaguely Pacific Rim,
<br>
is taken from the Latin annoto, meaning &quot;I scribble&quot;) had developed a cool
<br>
&quot;smart pen.&quot; Anoto was one of two finalists for a Best of Show award,
<br>
though interestingly, it lost to the Tablet PC, Microsoft's platform that
<br>
supports handwriting. Bill Gates' keynote, extolling the virtues of
<br>
handwritten input, included a demo in which he beamed a hand-drawn map to
<br>
an assistant - with directions to the nearest Starbucks.
<br>
<p>While the established heavyweight took home the prize, the concepts
<br>
driving the Anoto network are a lot more ambitious than Microsoft's latest
<br>
must-buy for the handheld sector. Pen-based interfaces are not exactly
<br>
news, even if being able to write in your own handwriting is considerably
<br>
easier than trying to recall the Graffiti symbol for the letter q. While
<br>
the Chatpen demo in the Ericsson booth - featuring a caricaturist whose
<br>
drawings were piped to a laptop screen - was cute, it barely hinted at
<br>
Anoto's potential.
<br>
<p>Anoto's approach, in contrast to Microsoft's, doesn't require a PC. Each
<br>
Anoto pen contains a Bluetooth chip that communicates with any other
<br>
Bluetooth device within 30 feet, which could be your mobile phone or
<br>
PDA. Ericsson will introduce the R520, the first handset to ship with
<br>
Bluetooth, in the US and Europe by the second half of this year. Nokia
<br>
already sells a Bluetooth card for its 6210 phone, and Toshiba started
<br>
shipping Bluetooth PC cards last fall. The penetration of these devices is
<br>
expected to snowball as the cost of Bluetooth chipsets plummets to
<br>
between $5 and $10 in the next three years. If the public-access
<br>
Bluetooth nodes now in development at companies like Cerulic and
<br>
NomadNetworks are widely installed in airports, hotels, and conference
<br>
centers, eventually all you'll need to carry is an Anoto-enabled pen and a
<br>
sheet of digital paper.
<br>
<p>As nifty and convenient as the porting of handwritten text to the Net
<br>
may seem, there will be even more advantages to liberation from the
<br>
networked typewriter. If your native language is, say, Chinese, Arabic, or
<br>
Russian, you will no longer have to translate your thoughts into an
<br>
alphabet that a QWERTY keyboard understands. Once symbols and line
<br>
drawings are as easy to pour into the datastream as ASCII, you won't
<br>
have to depend on text at all. Storyboards, architectural sketches, fabric
<br>
designs, game strategies, and comic strips will be emailed, faxed, or
<br>
posted to the Web as quickly as they can be sketched by hand. Equations,
<br>
with their special characters and sub- and superscripts, will be a breeze.
<br>
If you compose a melody on sheet music, you will be able to play it
<br>
instantly on your mobile phone or MIDI device. An artist will be able to
<br>
zap sketches from his atelier to the Kinko's around the corner.
<br>
<p>&quot;Leonardo da Vinci would be our perfect customer,&quot; brags Jan
<br>
Andersson, the president of Anoto.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen reads a near-invisible grid of gray dots to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fix a location on a map half the size of the United
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;States.
<br>
<p>The peerless doodler from Florence might have appreciated that the spark
<br>
of genius which makes the network function does not reside in Anoto's
<br>
fancy pens. It's printed on the paper.
<br>
<p>It's a map.
<br>
<p><p>The first time you see this map, you may not even notice it. Printed in a
<br>
shade of carbon-based ink called Anoto Black that's more visible at the
<br>
infrared end of the spectrum, the map appears as a light-gray dusting of
<br>
dots, forming a nearly invisible grid on the surface of the paper. Each
<br>
sheet of digital paper carries only a small portion of the map. If you
<br>
look at an Anoto-enabled Post-it, what you're seeing is a Post-it-sized
<br>
fraction of a map that is actually 1.8 million square miles - half the
<br>
area of the US.
<br>
<p>Here's how it works: Beside the ballpoint tip of each Anoto-enabled pen
<br>
is a lens. Behind the lens is the same sort of CMOS image-sensing chip
<br>
used in cash machines and digital cameras. This tiny, inexpensive eye is
<br>
wired to a microprocessor in the pen. Every one-hundredth of a second,
<br>
the camera takes a snapshot of whatever portion of the map is
<br>
underneath the pen at any moment.
<br>
<p>The pen doesn't actually &quot;see&quot; what you're writing. The CMOS chip is
<br>
programmed to favor infrared, so the trail of ink is invisible to the
<br>
camera. All the pen sees is the map. (&quot;The ink is just there to make you
<br>
feel comfortable,&quot; purrs a piece of Anoto documentation, with typical
<br>
Swedish understatement.)
<br>
<p>The dots that make up the map are each one-tenth of a millimeter in
<br>
diameter, and they're arrayed on a grid of 2- by 2-millimeter squares, 36
<br>
dots to a square. In a basic grid square, these dots would be arranged
<br>
smoothly along x/y axes, like perfectly aligned chess pieces. All of the
<br>
points on the Anoto map, however, are slightly displaced from those
<br>
axes. This displacement creates a unique pattern in each square - and
<br>
there are 4,722,366,482,869,645,213,696 squares in all.
<br>
<p>To visualize this, imagine that you're writing on a huge sheet of graph
<br>
paper. The pattern of dots in any particular square corresponds to an
<br>
exact location on the sheet - say, &quot;B2.&quot; As you write on the paper, your
<br>
pen travels over a series of locations: from B2, to B3, then over to C1 as
<br>
you cross a t, and so forth. The movement of your pen over these
<br>
locations corresponds exactly to the shape of what you're writing. Using
<br>
the map, the pen obtains a precise reading of its position on the vast
<br>
grid, down to one-thirtieth of a millimeter. As the instrument dances
<br>
across the grid, it stores a series of locations. It time-stamps this
<br>
itinerary, in case later verification is needed. There's enough memory in
<br>
the pen to store about a hundred notebook-sized pages of writing.
<br>
<p>Each instrument is coded with a unique identity. The pen in your pocket
<br>
might be number 754348847, for example. When you check off one of the
<br>
special function boxes - like &quot;Send as fax&quot; - in the corner of each piece
<br>
of paper, the pen transmits the contents of its memory to Anoto-powered
<br>
Bluetooth devices in your network. (In addition to the standard Bluetooth
<br>
security layer, this information is also encrypted by the pen, using
<br>
Public Key Infrastructure and 128-bit keys.) From one of those devices,
<br>
such as a phone or PDA with a wireless modem, the burst of information
<br>
from the pen hitches a ride to the Net.
<br>
<p>It's important to make one thing clear: The Anoto pen does not understand
<br>
language. With certain exceptions, the pen doesn't perform OCR (optical
<br>
character recognition) on what you've written to translate your
<br>
handwriting into standard ASCII text. The email messages you send out
<br>
arrive in recipients' in-boxes as small inline graphics files displaying
<br>
your words, in your handwriting, exactly the way you wrote it. (When you
<br>
send email to a mobile phone, it appears as a graphical SMS message.)
<br>
<p>Certain areas on the paper will be dedicated to OCR-related functions.
<br>
Letters and numbers - email addresses and subject lines, snail mail
<br>
addresses, and phone numbers - written carefully in form fields there will
<br>
be converted to ASCII characters. A digital business card, for instance,
<br>
might have lines on the back where you can enter contact information.
<br>
Checking &quot;Send&quot; would email that information to the person whose name
<br>
is on the front of the card.
<br>
<p>The pen doesn't know if you've just scribbled a love note, signed a pink
<br>
slip, or declared war. It knows only a few things: which pen it is in the
<br>
Anoto network, which locations on the map it's been seeing lately, and
<br>
what time it is. This information - the pen's identity and a series of
<br>
time-stamped locations on the map - is what gets transmitted to the
<br>
Net.
<br>
<p>There, the encrypted stream of bits from the pen employs standard DNS
<br>
protocols, like the ones used by a Web browser, to look for the Anoto Name
<br>
Server, or ANS, which is a multimillion-dollar array of Unix drives
<br>
currently under construction in Stockholm. The first ANS disk array will
<br>
be located there, but eventually Anoto will employ a distributed network
<br>
of servers. Each transmission from the pen arrives at the ANS with a
<br>
question: &quot;Who owns the part of the map where I am now?&quot;
<br>
<p>This is where things really get interesting. The big map is divided into
<br>
territories, with a certain number of grid squares allocated for various
<br>
products and services. One area of the map, say, might be reserved for
<br>
Filofax organizers. Another will be dedicated to Post-it Notes. A third
<br>
might belong to a software vendor who runs magazine ads printed on
<br>
digital paper. By entering into a partnership with Anoto, you buy your
<br>
own little chunk of real estate on the big map, which gives you the right
<br>
to print that portion of the map on your products - whether your
<br>
business is manufacturing legal pads, booking vacations on cruise ships,
<br>
or selling DVDs from a catalog.
<br>
<p>By tracking where each Anoto pen is on the map, the ANS knows, for
<br>
instance, that pen number 754348847 made a check mark at 12:03 pm in
<br>
an area of the grid that belongs to an online florist. The instrument then
<br>
transmits a message to the florist's own servers to fulfill the purchase
<br>
order, dispatching a dozen roses to the mailing address written at the
<br>
bottom of the paper. Because OCR is dodgy business - as anyone who
<br>
uses one of the fax-to-email services knows - the shipping address
<br>
might appear on the sender's mobile phone for verification before the
<br>
bouquet leaves the warehouse.
<br>
<p><p>Anoto isn't in this game to make a branded splash in the paper business,
<br>
or to steal market share from Bic. Ericsson's Chatpen will be used to
<br>
establish the standard, and the business of designing later versions of
<br>
the pen will fall to established players like Pilot and Montblanc. Anoto
<br>
won't be making paper, either.
<br>
<p>Anoto's business model resides in the ANS - in selling off chunks of the
<br>
big map, and tracking every transaction scribbled on digital paper. If a
<br>
purchase is made on Mead paper, with a Montblanc pen, and the product
<br>
or service is delivered to the customer by an online merchant, then Mead,
<br>
Montblanc, the merchant, and Anoto each get a cut. Anoto is betting
<br>
that it will be able to tap into revenue streams created by a breed of
<br>
paper-based ecommerce services that hasn't even been imagined yet.
<br>
<p>Such streams, however, can only run in courses laid by a widely accepted
<br>
standard. In that sense, Anoto is a thoroughly 21st-century business: It's
<br>
not about making widgets and shipping them to the consumer, or about
<br>
building a brand. It's about advocating a standard, and then insinuating a
<br>
new enterprise into the global infrastructure created by that standard.
<br>
<p>Anoto isn't locked into Bluetooth. If that technology confounds
<br>
expectations and is not widely adopted, Anoto could swap the transceiver
<br>
out of its pens for anything else that can do the job. However, the chip
<br>
inside the pen gives the thousands of companies committed to Bluetooth -
<br>
like Ericsson, which is keen on extending its market after facing
<br>
unexpected losses early this year - an incentive to adopt Anoto's own
<br>
standard for digital paper. Ericsson has picked up 15 percent of Anoto - a
<br>
subsidiary of C Technologies, a publicly traded company that is another of
<br>
Fåhraeus' ventures - with an option to pick up another 15 percent.
<br>
<p>Whether or not Anoto and its partners are able to make every application
<br>
come off smoothly - and more broadly, whether the entire project thrives
<br>
or stumbles - the network concept offers a preview of the world to come.
<br>
At one end of the digital spectrum, Moore's law and fat-pipe upgrades will
<br>
deliver heart-stopping clock speeds and insane amounts of bandwidth in the
<br>
next few years. But creative innovation is starting to flourish at the
<br>
other end, too, where swarms of highly networked and practically
<br>
disposable eyes and ears - like Anoto's pens - will be let loose on the
<br>
world to swarm around us, listening and testing, and buzzing with the news
<br>
of what they find.
<br>
<p>A poet once told me that a writer must write with &quot;the mind of God and the
<br>
eyes of a spider.&quot; Before the Net came along, there was a lot of
<br>
speculation that the ultimate product of technology, when we finally had
<br>
the hardware to build it, would be something approximating the mind of God
<br>
- a centralized superbrain. As we extend our networks into every available
<br>
niche of our lives, the ultimate product of technology is turning out to
<br>
be more like the sum of the sparks of intelligence in the eyes of billions
<br>
of ephemeral spiders, weaving webs in all the corners of creation.
<br>
<p>It's at this end of the spectrum that a startup like Anoto could blow
<br>
everyone's mind by establishing a standard that is widely adopted, and
<br>
scaling upward toward infinity.
<br>
<p><p>With its labyrinth of cobblestone streets, Romanesque cathedral, and
<br>
brooding medieval buildings housing bohemian cafés, Lund is the darkly
<br>
enchanted European college town of your dreams. An extraordinary number of
<br>
shops in Lund bear the sign Antikvariat, meaning &quot;a seller of old books
<br>
and antique maps.&quot; So it's only fitting that a new kind of map is being
<br>
conceived not far from here. The town's fascination with cartography goes
<br>
back at least as far as the 14th century, when a fantastically painted
<br>
astronomical clock was installed in the Lund cathedral to track the sun
<br>
and the moon through the zodiac, marking noon and 3 pm with a blast of
<br>
trumpets and a procession of mechanical Wise Men toward the Virgin Mary.
<br>
It still keeps good time.
<br>
<p>The town, which is much closer to Copenhagen than it is to Stockholm,
<br>
lies off the beaten path of the tourist trade, in part because many local
<br>
merchants shutter their windows after the students leave for the summer.
<br>
Swedes celebrate Lund for the climate of philosophical ferment
<br>
surrounding the university, which is balanced by an attitude that Swedish
<br>
essayist Jan Mårtensson called the Lund spirit: &quot;an ironic distance to
<br>
everything [and] a barb to deflate pompous self-importance.&quot;
<br>
<p>In 1983, faced with a decline in Sweden's traditional industrial mainstays
<br>
- shipbuilding and textile manufacturing - the town broke ground for the
<br>
first science park in Sweden: Ideon, where Anoto is located. Ideon's first
<br>
tenant was the Ericsson Mobile Telephony Laboratory. The
<br>
cross-fertilization of academic research and commercial development -
<br>
inspired by US models - proved fruitful. Ericsson's first portable mobile
<br>
phone, the C900, was designed at Ideon and brought to market in 1987.
<br>
<p>Fåhraeus grew up in Linköping and came to Lund as an undergraduate in
<br>
1986. His interests roamed broadly among the sciences, encompassing
<br>
medical biophysics, bioengineering, and the mathematical modeling of
<br>
neurons. As a teenager, he displayed a knack for making things happen.
<br>
When he was 15, he launched the local chapter of a conservative student
<br>
organization (the second largest in the country) and founded a reading
<br>
circle that received funds from the government. Though Fåhraeus
<br>
currently holds 7 patents and has filed applications for 50 more, he says,
<br>
&quot;I never thought of myself as an inventor. I never thought of myself as an
<br>
entrepreneur. But I was good at taking initiative, inventing games - or
<br>
reinventing them if I was losing.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the absolute-positioning map, the &quot;interface&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was no longer the device, but any surface you could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print the pattern on.
<br>
<p>In December 1994, Fåhraeus launched his first company, CellaVision, which
<br>
specializes in building microscopy systems that partially automate cell
<br>
analysis. It wasn't easy. In the early '90s, the chill winds of a global
<br>
recession, stirred up by currency speculation, blew over the Swedish
<br>
krona. The Swedish National Bank boosted its lending rate fivefold, while
<br>
executives from companies like Volvo floated down on golden parachutes to
<br>
countries with lower tax burdens, such as the United Kingdom.
<br>
<p>Just as the telecom revolution was getting under way, young Swedish
<br>
entrepreneurs scrabbled for sources of venture capital. Fåhraeus
<br>
persisted. In June of 1996, he founded C Technologies, which produced
<br>
his most successful product to date, a handheld scanner called the C Pen.
<br>
(Despite its name, the C Pen, which saw a modest $5 million in sales last
<br>
year, is not primarily a writing instrument.) Other products created at C
<br>
Tech include intelligent surveillance cameras (spun off to form a company
<br>
called WeSpot) and an optical mouse. A year after starting C Tech,
<br>
Fåhraeus launched Precise Biometrics, which specializes in fingerprint
<br>
recognition.
<br>
<p>The common thread running through Fåhraeus' product line is real-time
<br>
image processing. What the optical mouse, scanner, and Anoto pen have
<br>
in common is that they take digital snapshots of what they see to
<br>
determine their whereabouts. The camera in an optical mouse (such as the
<br>
Apple Pro Mouse) scrutinizes irregularities on the scrolling surface to
<br>
gauge what is called the mouse's relative position. The mouse judges
<br>
movement, not location. If you pick up the mouse and set it down, it
<br>
forgets where it was and starts tracking from zero again.
<br>
<p>The C Pen does let you add your own words to scanned text by tracing
<br>
letters on any irregular surface, like a page in a book. But because the C
<br>
Pen contains no ink, you don't see the letters you're writing. They're
<br>
preserved in the scanner's memory, and you can edit or transmit them like
<br>
regular scanned text. As with an optical mouse, however, lifting the C Pen
<br>
from its tracking surface cancels out its relative position. To write an
<br>
x, you have to use what's called a unistroke - you must cross a single
<br>
line over itself without lifting the pen, as you do with a palmtop stylus.
<br>
<p>Understandably, this annoyed Petter Ericson, a graduate student at Lund
<br>
University who began working for C Tech in March 1997. In a country of
<br>
reserved, fair-skinned blonds, Ericson has the swarthy good looks of an
<br>
Italian bad-boy film star. Fåhraeus also hired Ericson's high school
<br>
friend, Ola Hugosson. While Ericson's vitality seems barely contained
<br>
under a thicket of cowlicks, Hugosson is clearly focused inward. A
<br>
musician from a family of musicians, Hugosson plays Bach at home on the
<br>
piano. He met Ericson when they both enrolled in a national contest for
<br>
student programmers. Hugosson was impressed by the lightning rapidity of
<br>
Ericson's mind, while Ericson was awed by Hugosson's intensity as he bore
<br>
down on a problem. They made a powerful team. Ericson then encouraged
<br>
another old friend, Linus Wiebe, to take a job at Precise Biometrics.
<br>
<p>All three first learned how to program in the hacker subculture that
<br>
sprang up around an illustrious generation of home computers whose
<br>
names are legendary among programmers of a certain age: the Apple II,
<br>
the Commodore 64, the Atari 800, the Amiga 1000, and the Sinclair ZX
<br>
Spectrum. There was a narrow window where 13-year-old
<br>
geeks-in-training could sharpen their chops - and make friends all over
<br>
the world - by writing algorithms and hacking serious code. Before that,
<br>
computers were too expensive. After the introduction of so-called
<br>
user-friendly interfaces from Apple and IBM, the good stuff was all
<br>
hidden under the hood.
<br>
<p>Ericson and Hugosson brought the old hacker brio with them to C Tech,
<br>
where they were paid to explore answers to essential questions, and even
<br>
write their own operating system. &quot;I used to think, 'Later in our careers,
<br>
no one will ever let us do this,'&quot; Ericson recalls. By fall 1997, there
<br>
was a stew of applications for real-time image processing simmering there.
<br>
One of Fåhraeus' brainstorms involved printing a pattern on a mousepad
<br>
that a mouse could then read like a map. It would judge its position
<br>
absolutely, without reference to any prior location.
<br>
<p>One day in February 1999, after C Tech team members had been mulling
<br>
over concepts like this for months, Ericson decided to go home to nearby
<br>
Malmö and take a bath.
<br>
<p><p>Like any good citizen in a region of the planet where baking in a
<br>
cedar-planked room is considered the acme of relaxation, Ericson jumped
<br>
into the tub to clear his mind. &quot;A lot of this work is trying to solve a
<br>
problem while you're continuously interrupted by ringing phones and
<br>
ICQs. Your mind becomes like a bad Windows system running too many
<br>
background processes,&quot; he told me geekishly. He's convinced that hot
<br>
baths, like saunas, elevate the temperature of the brain, increasing the
<br>
flow of uncensored creative thinking.
<br>
<p>What came to him in the tub was dots.
<br>
<p>Coincidentally, one of the first methods ever proposed for marrying the
<br>
ease of writing by hand to the data-crunching velocity of computers also
<br>
employed dots. In the '50s, Bell System switchboard operators kept records
<br>
of the long distance calls they handled on 2½- by 5-inch scraps of paper
<br>
called toll tickets. Operators were scribbling 2 billion tickets a year,
<br>
but paying keypunch operators to transfer a year's worth of call records
<br>
to punch cards would have cost Bell $32 million. At the Eastern Joint
<br>
Computer Conference in 1957, T. L. Dimond of Bell Labs outlined a method
<br>
for capturing handwritten data directly. He proposed replacing the tickets
<br>
with a plastic tablet energized by a flow of current through the writing
<br>
stylus. To standardize the shapes of the handwritten characters so that a
<br>
computer could read them, Dimond suggested training the operators to
<br>
construct letters and numbers around pairs of dots, a method he called
<br>
&quot;dot constraint.&quot; Dimond named his device the Stylator.
<br>
<p>Most of the pen-based input devices available today use variations on
<br>
Dimond's strategy of embedding processing power in the writing surface.
<br>
Wacom tablets run magnetic pulses through a grid of embedded wires to
<br>
get a fix on the cursor's position. Many digital whiteboards employ
<br>
ultrasonic triangulation to do the same thing. Palmtops, of course, allow
<br>
users to write on the computer itself.
<br>
<p>This was Ericson's flash in the bathtub: A complex pattern of dots would
<br>
make an excellent map for absolute positioning. Dots are good &quot;primaries&quot;
<br>
for low-overhead image processing, because they look the same no matter
<br>
which way you rotate them. Even if the organization of the dots is random,
<br>
the device could consult a lookup table to determine which location in the
<br>
pattern it is seeing, and thus determine its position.  Using such a
<br>
table, however, squandered processing time and memory. &quot;This problem,&quot;
<br>
Ericson concluded, &quot;has Ola written all over it.&quot;
<br>
<p>After Ericson told Hugosson about his idea one Friday afternoon,
<br>
Hugosson was, indeed, all over the problem. With the many constraints
<br>
posed by a system that has to run super-efficiently on a handheld device,
<br>
it was a perfect puzzle for a mathematician who could appreciate the
<br>
beauty that Bach coaxed out of rigorous symmetries. When Ericson
<br>
returned to his desk on Monday morning, he found a sheet of paper, with
<br>
a pattern printed on it, waiting for him.
<br>
<p>Hugosson had spent the entire weekend pounding out the math,
<br>
incubating clouds of dots in C and PostScript. His solution was to
<br>
generate the pattern by using an algorithm, rather than depending on
<br>
brute processing power to sort through random messes of dots. That
<br>
way, the mouse wouldn't have to store the entire pattern in its memory. It
<br>
could merely store the algorithm.
<br>
<p>The pattern he presented to Ericson consisted of dots in two sizes,
<br>
spaced a millimeter apart. With the number of possible permutations of
<br>
small and large dots, the size of Hugosson's map was 4 by 4 meters. This
<br>
seemed like more than enough area to play with, because the men were
<br>
thinking only in terms of a device that would track across a mousepad or
<br>
a book.
<br>
<p>Then Tomas Edso and Mats-Petter Petterson, two student interns at C
<br>
Tech, suggested using dot displacement, rather than dot size, to
<br>
determine the unique pattern of locations on the grid. Each dot would
<br>
then yield two bits of information, corresponding to the degree of
<br>
displacement along the x and y axes, rather than one. Edso and
<br>
Petterson's strategy - which employed smaller dots, with 36 per square
<br>
instead of 25 - resulted in 272 possible arrangements of dots, rather
<br>
than 225. Even printing the dots only .3 millimeters apart - rather than 1
<br>
millimeter - and allowing for redundancy to correct for scanning errors,
<br>
the size of the grid became much larger. &quot;How big is the pattern today ?&quot;
<br>
members of the C Tech team would tease one another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From an area that would have covered 10 letter-sized sheets of paper,
</em><br>
and then several football fields, the pattern eventually grew as big as
<br>
Belgium, and finally to its current dimensions: the equivalent of
<br>
73,000,000,000 letter-sized sheets, or the area from the Pacific Ocean
<br>
to the Mississippi, and from the Rio Grande to the Canadian border.
<br>
<p>Clearly, there was a lot of there there. But what to do with it?
<br>
<p>One day in the lab, Ericson smashed open a Bic pen, extracted the tip
<br>
and ink supply, and taped it to a C Pen. Suddenly the &quot;interface&quot; was no
<br>
longer the device itself, but any surface that you could print the pattern
<br>
on.
<br>
<p>&quot;We realized we were sitting on something fundamental,&quot; Fåhraeus told
<br>
me. &quot;We were on a clean sheet of paper.&quot;
<br>
<p>It was Fåhraeus who had the bold notion of seeing that virtual territory
<br>
as marketable real estate in an enormous network of partnerships. For the
<br>
last six months, Örjan Johansson, chair of the Anoto board, has been
<br>
pounding the pavement, negotiating partnerships with 3M, Mead,
<br>
Ashford, At-A-Glance, Charles Letts, Time Manager International,
<br>
Filofax, and Time/System International in the US, as well as Esselte,
<br>
Unipapel, and Hermelin in Europe and Kokuyo in Japan - each market
<br>
leaders in their region. These companies have everything to gain: The
<br>
technical demands and costs of printing the Anoto pattern on their
<br>
products are trivial. (You can do it with any printing system that has
<br>
1,000 dpi resolution, and Anoto is developing plug-ins for Quark and
<br>
PageMaker as part of its developer's kit, which should be available by the
<br>
time you read this.)
<br>
<p>&quot;When you tell these companies that they can go from manufacturing plain
<br>
paper to becoming a service provider with paper as the portal, they
<br>
realize they're in a whole new ball game,&quot; Johansson told me. By
<br>
convincing the largest manufacturers in every paper market to print its
<br>
dots on their products, Anoto is establishing a de facto global standard
<br>
before consumers have even heard of the company.
<br>
<p>At Ideon, Fåhraeus sketched out Anoto's three-year plan for world
<br>
domination. First: License the pattern and pen technology to Anoto's
<br>
initial partners for a song - in some cases for free - to establish and
<br>
disseminate the standard. Then, in year one, sign partnerships with mobile
<br>
phone companies and telcos, who see the technology as a way to siphon
<br>
a flood of ecommerce sales through their own billing channels. A Chatpen
<br>
would be a natural accessory to sell, or give, to the owner of a Bluetooth
<br>
phone; the company that bills for the phone service could then take a
<br>
slice of every scribbled transaction. Sonera, the second-largest telecom
<br>
provider in Scandinavia, signed on in February, and announcements of
<br>
other major providers are expected at this year's CeBIT. When you sign
<br>
up for Sonera's mobile service, you'll be offered the option to subscribe
<br>
to Anoto's paper-based services.
<br>
<p>Year two: Market the technology in consumer-electronics stores,
<br>
branded with names now associated with personal computers. Year three:
<br>
Imagine racks of Anoto-enabled Parker pens for sale at Office Depot,
<br>
beside shelves of digital paper.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will link their beloved paper to the flow of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;digitized information, and paper-based ecommerce
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is just the beginning.
<br>
<p>In January 2000, Linus Wiebe left Precise Biometrics to join Anoto as
<br>
director of new concepts. Now his job is to weigh the business potential
<br>
of applications such as putting the Anoto map on standardized tests,
<br>
creating real-time lotto games, transmitting prescriptions directly to
<br>
pharmacies, printing active hyperlinks in books, and even laying the
<br>
pattern over the floors of warehouses so that forklifts can be steered
<br>
remotely.
<br>
<p>As descriptions of Anoto's technology have started to spread around the
<br>
world, the proposals that land daily in Wiebe's in-box reach farther and
<br>
farther afield. One email he received from a university proposed printing
<br>
the pattern on a curved semi-transparent plastic surface and embedding
<br>
the optics, processor, and Bluetooth transceiver into a 2- by
<br>
2-centimeter cube. &quot;I still do not know the problem they were trying to
<br>
address,&quot; Wiebe observes dryly.
<br>
<p>For Hugosson, this flood of potential applications for his algorithm is
<br>
immensely gratifying. &quot;When you can invent an idea that is so basic that
<br>
it leads to other ideas,&quot; he says, &quot;an idea that seems to have many
<br>
implications, an idea that leads to a completely new set of thinking ...&quot;
<br>
<p>He's quiet for a moment. &quot;I don't know how to express it in words,&quot; he
<br>
concludes.
<br>
<p><p>Why would a posse of hotshot Swedish coders - or more to the point, a
<br>
struggling telecom giant like Ericsson - hitch their wireless wagons to a
<br>
fading star? Everyone knows the paper industry must have been hit hard
<br>
by the overnight ubiquity of the PalmPilot and the Handspring Visor. And
<br>
surely, with Bluetooth - or a couple of years out, with 3G - the
<br>
2,000-year-long Age of Paper will soon be over.
<br>
<p>So whatever happened to the paperless office? There's actually more
<br>
paper in the digital office - cascading out of printers and clogging up
<br>
copy machines - than there was 10 years ago (30 percent more,
<br>
according to a report by the American Forest and Paper Association).
<br>
Like the paperback novel that was supposed to be supplanted by every
<br>
technical marvel from the radio to the ebook, paper solves more problems
<br>
than it creates. We don't hate paper - the way we hate insipid broadcast
<br>
TV, tangled telephone cords, futzing with Wite-Out, five-day waits for a
<br>
letter from across town, and stores that are open only at certain times of
<br>
day. It's the inert state of the data stored on paper that is a vexing
<br>
anachronism, and this is precisely the problem that Anoto addresses.
<br>
<p>Palmtops are indeed eating into the market for a specific kind of product:
<br>
the kind of paper - in day planners, calendars, and little black books -
<br>
that stores data that wants to communicate with our digital networks.
<br>
Executives for Mead and Franklin Covey carefully acknowledge that there's
<br>
been &quot;a flattening&quot; of the market in the last two years, specifically for
<br>
formats that handle contact lists and appointment schedules.
<br>
<p>The repeat business in this sector is still the envy of other industries.
<br>
Many of the 50 million customers who buy a couple of At-A-Glance calendars
<br>
every year, to say nothing of the estimated 800 million who buy diaries,
<br>
will part with their tattered paper products only when they're pried from
<br>
their cold, dead, pulp-loving fingers. Those buyers are so fanatically
<br>
loyal to specific model numbers and form factors that John Hayek, a senior
<br>
VP of marketing for Mead, calls it a &quot;religious&quot; market. Anoto will
<br>
furnish a way for people to link their beloved paper to the flow of
<br>
digitized information. For Mead, Hayek says, betting on Anoto is &quot;an
<br>
acknowledgement that a paper-based organization is looking forward in the
<br>
21st century.&quot;
<br>
<p>One area of the office market that is exploding, rather than flattening,
<br>
is in products that make it easier to &quot;co-use&quot; PDAs and paper-based media.
<br>
For the past few years, the companies Anoto is courting have been
<br>
struggling to find their footing in a changing landscape where critical
<br>
information is segregated on both sides of the paper-versus-digital
<br>
divide. &quot;Right now, we're all trying to synchronize Palms, phones,
<br>
Outlook, day planners, Web sites, and thousands of floating Post-it
<br>
Notes,&quot; says Jeff Anderson, VP of Franklin Covey's Eproducts and Planner
<br>
division. &quot;It's almost seamless now, but the big glaring gap is
<br>
paper-back-to-digital. Anoto is the last leg to the full solution.&quot;
<br>
<p>Despite all the clicking on the Web, there are many areas of the paper
<br>
domain where digital has barely made a dent. The annual cost of
<br>
processing forms that are filled in by hand, such as tax returns, is still
<br>
$700 billion in the US alone. There are innumerable applications in which
<br>
digital input could migrate happily to paper: imagine putting a check mark
<br>
in the newspaper to program your VCR. Anoto pens themselves will be
<br>
customized by users who check off options in manuals, the interface
<br>
fine-tuned by - what else? - ticking boxes on paper. If you want to
<br>
customize the color of the ink or the texture of a line in an email
<br>
message,
<br>
for instance, you'll choose from a list of options on a printed menu. Or
<br>
you could create a virtual flip book by sketching a series of drawings and
<br>
selecting a box labeled &quot;Send as GIF animation.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;From a paper-product manufacturer's perspective,&quot; says Hayek, &quot;we're
<br>
talking about a little more ink for the dots. It's an easy do.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Like the other startups rising out of the mud at Ideon, Anoto represents
<br>
not only a new generation of aggressively innovative Swedish IT
<br>
ventures, but a new generation of Swedes.
<br>
<p>At a restaurant with a sweeping view of Stockholm's Old City, I washed
<br>
down eight kinds of herring with five flavors of akavit with Per Bill, a
<br>
member of parliament who championed many of the changes in policy that
<br>
have made his country a leader in the emerging wireless landscape. He
<br>
articulated the changes in the Swedish psyche wrought by the economic
<br>
upheavals of the last decade.
<br>
<p>&quot;In California, it's fun to be rich, and it's also OK to go bankrupt. In
<br>
Japan, if you fail, you're supposed to commit seppuku,&quot; he said. &quot;Ten
<br>
years ago in Sweden, you were not allowed to be rich, and you were also
<br>
not allowed to fail.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bill used a virtually untranslatable word as the key to understanding the
<br>
avoidance of both conspicuous success and humiliating failure that is
<br>
deeply ingrained in the Swedish psyche: lagom. Meaning something like
<br>
&quot;lukewarm&quot; and &quot;just enough,&quot; lagom is the inclination among Swedes to
<br>
shun ostentation, accept modest rewards, be good team players, and fly
<br>
under the radar. In the past, the positive side of lagom caused Swedes to
<br>
refuse to allow the kind of desperate poverty in their ranks that is
<br>
business as usual in the US. The negative side could be seen in the
<br>
tendency for the Swedish government to expend energy twiddling with
<br>
the economy from the top down, rather than seeding it from the ground
<br>
up by providing incentives for entrepreneurs.
<br>
<p>What shook up the lagom mindset, he explained, was the recession.
<br>
Before 1994, Swedes thought that 4 percent unemployment was a
<br>
catastrophe; within a year or two, more than one in ten Swedes found
<br>
themselves out of work. A precipitous change in economic status became
<br>
less of a cause for loss of face. To compete in the global IT marketplace,
<br>
Bill observed, &quot;you have to embrace the possibility of failure.&quot;
<br>
<p>Startups like Anoto are training grounds for a generation of Swedes who
<br>
grew up watching Dallas and Falcon Crest, becoming early adopters of
<br>
technology, and absorbing American notions of ambition. Now that
<br>
they're launching their own companies, says Lars-Fredric Hansson of
<br>
Ernst &amp; Young ePartners, they've been getting assistance from an
<br>
unexpected source. The managers who made golden-parachute exits to
<br>
countries with lighter tax burdens when the recession hit are coming
<br>
home to Sweden to invest in the next generation of IT entrepreneurs.
<br>
<p>There's a fitting symbol of this convergence of old and new economies
<br>
outside the Ericsson headquarters at Ideon: a stone monument to Harald
<br>
Bluetooth, who was the king of Denmark in the 10th century. In one hand,
<br>
he holds a phone, and in the other, a laptop. The significance of the name
<br>
Bluetooth for the group that developed the wireless standard originates
<br>
with the king, who threw parties for his fiercest rivals. These wild
<br>
affairs would &quot;help clear out the bad feeling,&quot; said board chair
<br>
Johansson, who came to Anoto after spearheading the Bluetooth initiative
<br>
at Ericsson. Many members of the original Bluetooth coalition had long
<br>
been cutthroat competitors: Ericsson and Nokia; IBM and Toshiba; the US
<br>
versus Japan.
<br>
<p>&quot;My aunt used to hold out her closed fist and say, 'How much can you get
<br>
in this hand? It's much easier to get something in this hand,'&quot; Johansson
<br>
explained, relaxing his fist. In this way, the monument stands as a symbol
<br>
of the positive side of lagom - knowing when to lay aside your arms,
<br>
even in the presence of your rivals, to achieve a common goal.
<br>
<p>That's why Johansson wasn't particularly disappointed that Anoto lost to
<br>
Microsoft at Comdex. When the Anoto team saw the Tablet PC, he says,
<br>
they immediately began thinking of ways to build bridges between the two
<br>
technologies. &quot;Maybe they're creating the back end, and we're creating
<br>
the front end. Writing on glass - how fun is that?&quot;
<br>
<p>Not as much fun, Anoto is betting, as making it possible for the mind of
<br>
the Net to reach as close as the page of the magazine you're reading right
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>&quot;The paper companies have been feeling that the digital train had passed
<br>
them by,&quot; Wiebe told me in a Stockholm coffee shop. &quot;We're throwing out
<br>
a hook, saying, 'C'mon, join us. Paper has been right all along. We're
<br>
bringing you with us.'&quot;
