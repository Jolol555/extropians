<p>So we now have two *limited* versions of the Turing test.  This
<br>
one is limited because the posters on Emlyn's AOLisa site were
<br>
likely young people who had never heard of Elisa.  Had they been
<br>
briefed beforehand, they would not have been fooled.  I assume
<br>
most of those reading this have played with Elisa or at least know
<br>
what it is.  We would likely have recognized the joke early.  Yet
<br>
this experiment definitely must be considered a Turing test, of sorts.
<br>
<p>The other interesting *limited* case of a Turing test would be
<br>
in chess software.  I have watched this field develop over the
<br>
past 25 years.  Up until about 15 years ago, it was not difficult
<br>
to distinguish between a human player and a machine.  As the
<br>
machines got better, they became more human-like in their play.
<br>
They became more likely to give up wood for position, something
<br>
the early software would seldom do.  They became much more
<br>
strategic and less tactical.
<br>
<p>A most interesting case study for post-singularity historians would
<br>
be the match between then-world champion Gary Kasparov and
<br>
Deep Blue.   In the last game of the match, after Deep Blue
<br>
made its last move, Kasparov resigned and asserted that some
<br>
human must be helping the machine!  Its play demonstrated such
<br>
a deep &quot;understanding&quot; of positional chess that the grandmaster
<br>
was convinced no machine could ever do it.  Only after it was
<br>
repeatedly demonstrated did Kasparov finally accept that his
<br>
beloved game really can be reduced to a set of equations.
<br>
<p>Modern chess software running on modern computing hardware
<br>
plays in a way that is indistinguishable from a really sharp human
<br>
player.  I sure cant tell the difference.
<br>
<p>My friends, thats all it is, and thats all we are, wet computers
<br>
that somehow do what we do.  Both cases give me hope that
<br>
we will eventually figure out a way to encase ourselves in a
<br>
more robust and permanent &quot;body&quot;.  spike
