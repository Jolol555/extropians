<p>Hydrogen is not at all hard to acquire. You can make hydrogen from
<br>
any (preferably hydrogen-rich) fuel by a fuel reforming process.
<br>
Googling for &quot;hydrogen&quot; &quot;fuel&quot; &quot;reforming&quot; or &quot;reformer&quot; should 
<br>
give you plenty of hits.
<br>
<p>As to subject to explosions, I'm too tired (and have sniffed far
<br>
too much paint solvent today) to make a websearch, but I suspect
<br>
methane will do slightly better than hydrogen in terms of destruction,
<br>
though hydrogen has probably much larger explosion corridor.
<br>
<p>Wtf, I did make a websearch, and found this:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fuelcellstore.com/hydrogen_safety.html">http://www.fuelcellstore.com/hydrogen_safety.html</a>
<br>
I was wrong on a few issues, but not by much.
<br>
<p>Of course a gas pipeline needs to have tighter checking on leaks
<br>
due to hydrogen higher diffusivity. But if you make your hydrogen
<br>
in the cellar in a fuel reformer, that's quite irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;A fuel processor extracts the hydrogen from the gas or LPG.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A fuel cell changes the hydrogen to electricity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A power conditioner converts the fuel cell electricity to the type and quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of power that you use today.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if we could just figure out how to do it with something (else) that works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as hydrogen for the reducing agent...
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with methane? What's wrong with hydrogen, for that matter, if
<br>
it's made from water, using solar photons usually wasted to heat your roof?
