<p>Unfortunately Curt, you are simply wrong.  (Ooopppps... I think
<br>
I hear the politeness police knocking at my door....).
<br>
<p>We do *not* need machine-phase self-replication (by which I'm
<br>
assuming you mean classical diamondoid self-replicating nanobots)
<br>
in order to solve &quot;all our problems&quot;.  As pointed out by Damien
<br>
in the Spike (quoting me from the EI archives and/or a personal
<br>
communication) you have to carefully differentiate between
<br>
&quot;self-replication&quot;, &quot;self-assembly&quot;, &quot;molecular assembly&quot;
<br>
*and* mechano-synthetic, non-solution phase assembly of materials
<br>
stronger than those that can be produced by available methods.
<br>
<p>The first three (SR, SA &amp; MA) are all properties of normal
<br>
biological organisms.  And because you can get the SR times
<br>
of these down to ~20 minutes (at least), you can solve
<br>
&quot;all our problems&quot; because the mass doubling time of organisms
<br>
we can design is much faster than the mass doubling time of our
<br>
humanity.
<br>
<p>And I'm fairly sure we can design them to build a house, at
<br>
least there is a description of what that would look like in
<br>
my current business plan.  Mind you it might take a couple
<br>
of years to grow the house using only local energy sources
<br>
but it does seem feasible.
<br>
<p>I'm willing to make $100 bets with people that the
<br>
manufacturing cost of designer bacteria with 1 million+
<br>
base genomes will be under $10.00 by 2010.  I suppose this
<br>
is something we should move over to the idea futures site
<br>
so I can make a killing on it...
