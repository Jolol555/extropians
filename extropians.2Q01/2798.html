<p>In the case of transparency, something *will* happen: more and
<br>
smaller cameras everywherer.  {Thats my new word: everywherer-
<br>
meaning more ubiquitous.}  This is regardless of who advocates
<br>
what.  There is no way to legislate them away, any more than we
<br>
can command the tide to fall back into the sea.  I see the job of
<br>
libertarians to demand increasing permissiveness and acceptance
<br>
in anticipation of the million electronic eyes that are now in the
<br>
design phase.  What else can we do?  Pass a law that engineers
<br>
must stop designing tiny cameras?
<br>
<p>A most vexing problem is this.  We are already at the point where
<br>
we cannot be *sure* of privacy in any public restroom, or any
<br>
hotel room.  Current cameras are easy to hide.  So in a sense
<br>
we are alread there: we cannot really be sure we are not being
<br>
watched or listened to, even now.

<p><em>&gt; everybody knows

</em><br>
<p>You are right Anders.  My own little town of Milpitas has a
<br>
public example of a camera nut: he hid a camera in the womens
<br>
restroom of his dental office, videotaped for who knows how
<br>
long and was found out only because he was an idiot, not
<br>
because the camera was discovered.  If him, why not others?
<br>
The local dentist advertised to other camera nuts what can be
<br>
done.  You know there must be thousands of these devices
<br>
already in place.  spike
