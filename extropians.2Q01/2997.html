</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; Quite a number of things.  User-supplied annotations do not have a truly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; good or even passable access idiom - including annotation namespacing and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; annotation metadata, for example - in any language of which I am aware.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;You ducked the 'what exactly constitutes an annotation' question, so
<br>
&nbsp;I'm not sure then what conventions you'd find comfortable for
<br>
&nbsp;manipulating or scoping it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; There are things I expect to do in Flare that I will only be able to do
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in, say, Python by badly reinventing Flare, like trying to write C++
</em><br>
<em> &gt; programs in C.  Sure, you can implement your own virtual function tables,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; but do you really want to?  Just having a picture in my mind of Flare has
</em><br>
<em> &gt; already led me to write seriously different (and better) Python programs
</em><br>
<em> &gt; with quick-and-dirty emulated Flare behaviors.
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt; For example, the program that I use to maintain my Webpages
</em><br>
<em> &gt; actually reads in fragments of Python code from an XML file and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; organizes them using the attached attributes.  Even without being
</em><br>
<em> &gt; able to use the debugger on those code fragments, there's still
</em><br>
<em> &gt; been an improvement in programming speed just resulting from more
</em><br>
<em> &gt; modular design.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This is generally called a &quot;macro preprocessor.&quot; Try not to put your
<br>
&nbsp;eye out.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Frankly, I see no good reason why you have a need to immediately
</em><br>
<em> &gt; hypothesize anything about Flare one way or the other, rather than
</em><br>
waiting
<br>
<em> &gt; on further information.  Flare simply hasn't made it to the top of my
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to-do list yet, in part because people like you keep asking me to write
</em><br>
<em> &gt; documents, and a lot of those requests have a higher priority than Flare.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Then unsubscribe, do some work, and accomplish something that can
<br>
&nbsp;speak for itself. Otherwise, if you want to keep playing visionary,
<br>
&nbsp;get used to answering questions about the vision.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I now politely request that you stop bugging me about this.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Sure - my mistake.
