[Note from Matthew Gaylor: I'll be a panelist at LFScon, the 
<br>
Society's first national conference and 20th anniversary celebration. 
<br>
I'll be speaking on The Internet and Freedom.  See the message below 
<br>
for details.  I've had the pleasure to be a judge for a number of 
<br>
years now and I especially enjoyed this year's selection of &quot;Truth&quot; 
<br>
which deals with the freedom of the press set in a fantasy universe.]
<br>
<p><p>For immediate release

<p>Libertarian Futurist Society announces Prometheus Award finalists for 
<br>

<br>
<p>The Libertarian Futurist Society has selected five novels as finalists for
<br>
its annual Prometheus Award for Best Novel.
<br>
<p>The LFS's Best Novel Finalist judging committee has chosen five novels
<br>
published in 2000 for the 2001 award:

<br>

<br>
* The Truth, by Terry Pratchett  (HarperCollins)
<br>
* Forge of the Elders, by L. Neil Smith  (Baen Books)
<br>
* Eagle Against the Stars, by Steve White (Baen Books)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Pratchett and White have been honored as
<br>
Prometheus Award finalists. Three of the five finalist authors are previous
<br>
Prometheus Award winners: MacLeod won most recently in 1998 for ’&quot;The Stone
<br>
Canal&quot;, and in 1996 for ’&quot;The Star Fraction.&quot;.  Smith won in 1994 for
<br>
&quot;Pallas&quot; and in 1982 for ’&quot;The Probability Broach&quot;.’ Flynn won in 1991 for
<br>
&quot;In the Country of the Blind&quot;’ and in 1992 for ’&quot;Fallen Angels&quot;’
<br>
(co-authored by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle);
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve novels were nominated by LFS members for this year’ awards. The
<br>
other nominees were Candle, by John Barnes  (TOR Books); The Legend That Was
<br>
Earth, by James Hogan (Baen Books); Outlaw School, by Rebecca Ore
<br>
(HarperCollins/EOS); &quot;Chimera&quot;, by Will Shetterly (TOR Books); 
<br>

<br>
(Forge Books); and &quot;All the Rage&quot;, by F. Paul Wilson (FORGE Books)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner will be announced over the Labor Day weekend in Philadelphia in
<br>
an awards ceremony at the World Science Fiction Convention. This year’ Best
<br>
Novel winner will receive a plaque and a one-ounce gold coin, double the size
<br>
of previous years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Society will present its annual Prometheus Hall of Fame
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prometheus Awards for Best Novel and Best Classic Fiction (Hall of
<br>
Fame) honor outstanding science fiction/fantasy that explores the
<br>
possibilities of a free future, champions human rights (including personal
<br>
and economic liberty), dramatizes the perennial conflict between individuals
<br>
and coercive governments, or reveals the tragic and harmful consequences of
<br>
abuse of power-- especially by the State.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prometheus Award, sponsored by the Libertarian Futurist Society (LFS),
<br>
was established in 1979, making it one of the most enduring awards after the
<br>
Nebula and Hugo awards, and one of the oldest fan-based awards currently in
<br>
sf.  Presented annually since 1982 at the World Science Fiction Convention,
<br>
the Prometheus Awards include a gold coin and plaque for the winners. Last
<br>
year’ Prometheus Award winner for Best Book was Vernor Vinge’ &quot;Deepness
<br>
in the Sky’&quot; (TOR Books).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hall of Fame, established in 1983, focuses on older classic fiction,
<br>
including novels, novellas, short stories, poems and plays.Past Hall of Fame
<br>
awardwinners range from Robert Heinlein and Ayn Rand to Ray Bradbury and
<br>
Ursula LeGuin.  Last year's winner was Hans Christian Anderson for &quot;The
<br>
Emperor's New Clothes.''
