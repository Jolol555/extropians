<em>&gt; Eliezer, sometimes you make me smile.  And towards the end

<em>&gt; However, if the physicists are approaching a complete TOE, or at

</em><br>
<em>&gt; best cognitive science will not be able to build better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicists.  Fundamentally physics is about reducing things
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it becomes useless to try an extract any more from an empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.
</em><br>
<p>Physics doesn't end after a TOE.  Not the way the current TOE is thought
<br>
of as more or less not much more than a glorified GUT.  Having a TOE
<br>
doesn't mean you know everything it only means you understand the
<br>
physical lowest level basics thoroughly of the model set to date.  It
<br>
doesn't even mean you understand all the implications or all of what is
<br>
possible or how to do everything that is possible or even the full
<br>
limits of what is possible. 
<br>
<p>Also I have a sneaking suspicion the TOE will only make our current
<br>
model conssitent but that the current model isn't the end of the story
<br>
at all.  It only seemed like it was given the current limitations of
<br>
what we know.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand the phase space of what you can explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of building things based on the laws of physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems phenomenally large!  You really want the cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists to enhance the engineers who in turn enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cogntive scientists and so on and so forth.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will hit a limit on how much you can explore per unit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of real time but that exploration will be a very rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voyage indeed.
</em><br>
<p>What exactly is &quot;real time&quot;?
