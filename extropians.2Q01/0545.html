Oh boy, does this open a can of worms...

</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  Spike, you need some more &quot;global awareness&quot;.  Many nations
<br>
in Africa (or relocated tribal groups in Indonesia) are perfectly
<br>
content to wage war against each other with *no* significant
<br>
awareness of what goes on in the &quot;techno-have&quot; countries.  One
<br>
can certainly extend this to the Iran-Iraq conflicts a decade ago
<br>
or the Yugo-regional conflicts occuring now-a-days..
<br>
<p>You also need to study the history of the U.S. a bit more, such
<br>
as the recent PBS series on the life of Abraham Lincoln and the
<br>
Civil War.  I suspect you can find similar conflicts in areas
<br>
such as the United Kingdom (England vs. the Irish, Welsh &amp; Scots),
<br>
various Roman provinces, city-states of Greece, modern India-Pakistan
<br>
divisions, etc.
<br>
<p>Why was there a &quot;civil war&quot;?  Because the perspective of one group
<br>
(the Northerners) threatened the livelyhood of another group
<br>
(the Southerners) who depended on the concept of slavery for
<br>
econonimic survival.  Why is this primcipal important?  Well,
<br>
it would seem to go back to the fundamental principles that
<br>
the anthropologists explain are the two fundamental reasons
<br>
that primitive societies go to war -- for food or for mates.
<br>
<p>Bottom line on the civil war -- if you are some poor southern
<br>
trash whose estate is worthless because there are no slaves
<br>
to work it -- translates to no food and no food translates to
<br>
no mates and that provides sufficient justification for going
<br>
to war.
<br>
<p>Carry it to the Iran/Iraq/Kuwait sitation -- more territory
<br>
translates to more wealth (food) translates to more mates.  That
<br>
is reason enough to go to war -- better make sure you can win though!
<br>
<p>Translate it to the Isreal/Palestinean arena -- one &quot;rich&quot;
<br>
group in power (gets food and mates) and another group that is
<br>
out-of-power (gets less food and fewer mates [or gets mates
<br>
and sub-optimal survival of children]).
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Now, and this is important, because it deals with the fundamental
<br>
structural differences between the &quot;current&quot; and &quot;future&quot; realities...
<br>
<p>As Eliezer S. Yudkowsky points out:
<br>
<em>&gt; I think this won't work and will in fact backfire horribly as dictators 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to recoup their cost by conquering and exploiting other countries. 
</em><br>
<p>There is an *IMPLICIT* assumption in this statement that the
<br>
&quot;population&quot; of a dictatorial country stills &quot;exists&quot;.  What nation
<br>
could sustain a population with an oppressive dictator if nearby
<br>
nations are fully able to accept and support refuges of that
<br>
nation?  What nations would hesitate to eliminate a sociopathic
<br>
&quot;dictator&quot; who is causing trouble if the effects on the regional
<br>
population could be minimized?
<br>
<p>If you have the technology to create &quot;robotic&quot; armies, you
<br>
presumably have the technology for robotic &quot;assassins&quot;,
<br>
&quot;saboteurs&quot;, etc.  If you have the technology for those
<br>
functions, why not simply create robots that create robots
<br>
that produce all material requirements of a a society?
<br>
So in one fell swoop, one eliminates any &quot;physical&quot; motivations
<br>
for going to &quot;war&quot;, leaving only &quot;philosophical&quot; reasons.
<br>
<p>Why is there a need or desire to &quot;exploit&quot; other countries when
<br>
you have the ability to provide all material requirements oneself?
<br>
<p>I will label this the:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Implausible Future due to Incongruous Reality&quot;
<br>
argument (henceforth &quot;IFdtIR&quot;).
<br>
<p>I will come down very hard on people such as Spike or Eliezer
<br>
who premise their arguments on IFdtIR.
<br>
<p>If you have robotics sufficient grow/harvest/manufacture food to
<br>
last until you die from whatever causes, then one only goes to war
<br>
for &quot;mates&quot;.  If one has the ability to vary ones appearence,
<br>
personality, etc. with drugs or other more extensive self-modifications,
<br>
then &quot;mates&quot; should not be a problem.  If for some reason they
<br>
&quot;are&quot; a problem, then one modifies ones self-perception such that
<br>
they are not &quot;really&quot; a problem or manufactures 'droids which
<br>
can fullfill 'mate' requirements.
<br>
<p>In this environment, one is faced with dealing only with people who
<br>
cause problems because they have in some way already have warped minds.
<br>
<p>So the fundamental question becomes &quot;To what degree may one alter
<br>
the 'mindset' of conscious entities to safeguard the security of
<br>
the majority?&quot;
