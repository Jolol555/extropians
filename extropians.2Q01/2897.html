INTRODUCING KRYOS, INC --A NEW CRYONICS SERVICE PROVIDER
<br>
<p>-By Mike Darwin and E. Shaun Russell
<br>
<p><p><p>WHERE WE ARE NOW
<br>
<p>Nearly three years ago I made public a decision I had been considering since
<br>
1997: to leave an active role in cryonics and focus exclusively on research.
<br>
I made this decision for the following reasons:
<br>
<p>First, I felt despair at the prospects for the progress and long term
<br>
survival of any cryonics organization offering quality services. For nearly
<br>
30 years I had watched as one cryonics organization after another
<br>
experienced the same failure mode, namely the triumph of expediency and
<br>
&quot;economy&quot; in patient care over quality. It became apparent to me that the
<br>
principal reason for this problem was that the fundamental premise of
<br>
cryonics contained the seeds of its own destruction.  If it was indeed
<br>
impossible to prove that a given treatment method was good or bad, or was
<br>
incapable of being reversed by advanced technology which might emerge over a
<br>
period of many centuries, then sloppy, inexpensive or expedient methods of
<br>
preservation would necessarily out-compete better methods.
<br>
<p>In fact, it becomes impossible to tell what &quot;better&quot; is, if there are no
<br>
standards of reference. When a patient has a conventional medical treatment
<br>
there are many good standards of reference. Survival and good recovery of
<br>
the patient in real-time is arguably the best! The rates of survival,
<br>
complications, and other measures of outcome are also quantifiable in
<br>
real-time for almost all medical procedures. This is true for almost all of
<br>
medicine and technology, and even the commercial world as well. Usually
<br>
sooner, rather than later, a bad approach is weeded out. This is the essence
<br>
of the scientific method. It has given all the technological riches we enjoy
<br>
today. This success  is utterly dependent upon feedback about the worth of
<br>
each and every intervention in terms not only of gross outcome, but also in
<br>
terms of cost effectiveness. Unfortunately, there is no such feedback in
<br>
cryonics. What's worse, desperate people with limited resources are
<br>
especially liable to buy hope at a cost they can afford...regardless of
<br>
whether that hope is rooted in any real evidence. 
<br>
<p>It became clear to me that what was needed were major advances in ischemia
<br>
(resuscitation) and cryopreservation technology which would serve as an
<br>
objective means of validating the techniques being used. Better still would
<br>
be reversible or nearly reversible brain cryopreservation which would then
<br>
serve as the standard against which all human cases should be weighed.
<br>
<p>Similarly important would be to truly validate that 15 to 30 minutes of
<br>
arrested circulation at normal body temperature was compatible with full
<br>
recovery of memory and personality. This is of great importance since, even
<br>
with vastly improved cryopreservation techniques, time delays until the
<br>
start of cryonics procedures of this length after legal death was pronounced
<br>
could be routinely expected. We needed to be certain that these kinds of
<br>
ischemic intervals could be reversed and that it would be possible not only
<br>
to deliver better methods of cryoprotection under these adverse
<br>
circumstances, but that we were really preserving the essence of the
<br>
patient: his or her memory and personality.
<br>
<p>Now, for the first time in its history, I believe that cryonics technology
<br>
has reached the point where it may be possible to foresee revival and
<br>
recovery of patients treated under optimum conditions today (i.e., those who
<br>
are still relatively young and do not have primary brain disease) within as
<br>
little as 20 years from now. This is not being done, and the implications of
<br>
this are staggering on two fronts:
<br>
<p>First, the number of lives that can be saved using cryonics with a high
<br>
degree of assurance and without the development of &quot;contingent&quot; and
<br>
hard-to-predict advanced technologies (such as a fully mature
<br>
nanotechnology) is greatly expanded.
<br>
<p>Second, and following from the above, is a greatly expanded market for
<br>
cryonics services. Even under the current adverse conditions, the Cryonics
<br>
Institute is treating approximately one patient per month. Other cryonics
<br>
organizations turn away a much higher number of qualified, at-need cases.
<br>
Clearly, even in the absence of improved public perception of what cryonics
<br>
has to offer, the tide has started to turn.
<br>
<p><p>WHERE WE COULD BE
<br>
<p>Over the past 6 months I, and a number of other people both long involved
<br>
with and new to cryonics have been systematically planning to launch a
<br>
cryopreservation company that can achieve the objectives I have outlined in
<br>
the paragraphs above. The successful creation of such a company would
<br>
provide an alternative for those of you who still want the very best, but
<br>
feel you have not been able to find it in existing cryopreservation
<br>
facilities.  We are now pleased to announce that this company has been
<br>
incorporated under the name Kryos Inc., and that we have leased a nearly 
<br>
ideal building for the purpose of human cryopreservation services in
<br>
Southern California.  As opposed to other cryonics organizations, our focus
<br>
will be on at-need and non-US members and patients.  For those of you who
<br>
are interested in pre-need arrangements, you will be able to make them
<br>
through any cryonics organization that chooses to contract with us or
<br>
through Kryos itself.  Currently, ACS is working with us to provide services
<br>
to its members.
<br>
<p>When I left Critical Care Research I retained ownership of virtually all of
<br>
the equipment required to deliver the highest quality cryonics services
<br>
before the advent of vitrification technology. This constitutes an enormous
<br>
volume and variety of equipment, the replacement cost of which I estimate to
<br>
be on the order of $850,000. Thus, much of the incredibly capital-intensive
<br>
work of starting a cryonics services company has been done. This is not to
<br>
underestimate what lies ahead, though it greatly decreases part of the burden.
<br>
<p>If you are interested in our activities I invite you to contact us.  Due
<br>
primarily to financial constraints, what we are trying to do has some odds
<br>
against success. Despite the enormous technological strides made in
<br>
cryonics-related research over the past few years, there have rarely been
<br>
more obstacles to applying them. Saul Kent, once a mainstay of support is no
<br>
longer willing to provide financial support without solid evidence of a
<br>
broad based willingness of others to do the same. To the best of my
<br>
knowledge this applies to all cryonics efforts... not just those of Kryos.
<br>
Frankly, not only do I not blame Saul for this position, I *champion* it.
<br>
For too long others have taken for granted that Saul and Bill Faloon will
<br>
pay the way for them. I know this is true because at the end, even I took it
<br>
for granted. In our current situation, Saul has stated that he will
<br>
contribute funding to this project, though at this point I would prefer to
<br>
find other financial means before this is even considered.
<br>
<p>Despite some of the events of the past, I have proven to be reliable, honest
<br>
and effective in the projects with which I have been involved. Though
<br>
failures of cryonics institutions (both with and without my involvement)
<br>
have done much to damage the credibility of the technology of cryonics in
<br>
general, I strongly believe that cryonics can be made both viable and
<br>
credible as an alternative to certain death. Currently, I have assembled a
<br>
team which is willing to do whatever is necessary to make this project a
<br>
reality.  As mentioned above, we have recently incorporated under the name
<br>
Kryos Inc. and have leased a facility accordingly.  We have also received
<br>
significant support from the American Cryonics Society (ACS) as well as from
<br>
CryoCare founding member Bob Kreuger. It is very clear that their
<br>
perspective on what should be possible is equivalent to mine. They believe,
<br>
as I do, that Kryos has the potential to become the leading provider of
<br>
human cryopreservation services, and an equivalent or preferable alternative
<br>
to the other facilities currently in existence.
<br>
<p>For those of you who want *more* --for those of you who want to see the
<br>
dream fulfilled of fully reversible suspended animation within the next two
<br>
decades, and continued solid improvement in the techniques and conditions
<br>
under which cryonics patients are treated until then, I invite you to
<br>
contact Kryos Inc. via myself at <a href="mailto:mgdarwin@cs.com?Subject=Re:%20ANNOUNCEMENT:%20Introducing%20Kryos&In-Reply-To=&lt;1.5.4.16.20010422215632.299f7f54@pop.earthlink.net&gt;">mgdarwin@cs.com</a> or (909) 276-8492 or E.
<br>
Shaun Russell at e_shaun@uniserve.com.  We welcome any and all questions and
<br>
comments you may have.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>Mike Darwin
<br>
CEO and Director, Kryos Inc.
<br>
<p>And
