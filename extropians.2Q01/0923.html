&quot;In any case, we can say with absolute confidence is that boredom is not
<br>
going to be a problem. Boredom is an emotion and already we have means
<br>
(drugs etc.) that can reliably dispel boredom for extended periods (albeit 
<br>
sometimes with side-effects). It is unthinkable that a jupiterbrain SI 
<br>
wouldn't be able to figure out a way of avoiding the boredom emotion if it 
<br>
chose to.&quot;
<br>
<p>I agree. It would probably create a role-playing game in which it would be a 
<br>
fragile, less-intelligent being in a world full of dangers and spend it's 
<br>
days immerse in this &quot;simulation&quot;. After all, games have been the main 
<br>
source of entertainment and boredom dispelling throughout the centuries, and 
<br>
they basically consist in limiting yourself to a previously arranged set of 
<br>
rules. Why not keep up the good work?
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S. - So, if our future is ourselves as we are today, is it really worth 
<br>
going through all the trouble of developing and evoluting? Not that we 
<br>
really have any choice in it...
