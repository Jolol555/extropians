</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effect, if it were to occur, is something that I am concerned about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You need to take into account that companies such as Microsoft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Oracle don't really have a problem getting people.  It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dot-com bubble that had a hard time hiring people.  In order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to solve that they were making crazy offers to lure people away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from more secure positions.  In retrospect, those offers were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified (as the risk-reward ratio now seems to have balanced out.)
</em><br>
<p>Obviously you haven't worked in some of these large established
<br>
companies. Oracle and Microsoft on one side and fluf-headed dot-com
<br>
bubble-babies on the other heh?  What a false dichotomy!  Sure there are
<br>
some software companies with a lot of applicants.  But don't think that
<br>
means they are happy with the level of talent they get overall.  And it
<br>
is certainly not the case that there are only established companies and
<br>
fluff-head companies in this business.  Businesses that are not
<br>
primarily software companies also have a tremendous problem finding and
<br>
retaining top-notch software people and, in many cases, mid and even
<br>
junior level positions also. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, I have not proven this contention. It seems that what I know of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; salaries made by the folks brought in to work at my company, I have heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they are making much less then the American Citizen proggies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This I would expect to be true.  For example I know of a brilliant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russian scientist who is now working at Celera.  I expect they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making less than their counterparts simply owing to the increased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overhead of communication difficulties.  There is a cost to having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a significant percentage of your staff be foreign trained and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-native english speaking.  The greater management costs translate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decreased employee salaries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That isn't it.  There is tremendous exploitation of people working here
<br>
that do not have citizenship who wish to have it.  They basically are
<br>
stuck in whatever fulltime position first hires them for a few years
<br>
unless the want to start the clock over at a new company.  Many
<br>
employers know this and underpay them on purpose.  Also some of the
<br>
native consulting type arrangements to bring people over (I have
<br>
experienced these with some of the firms handling Indian workers
<br>
especially) often rip both their native clients and the American
<br>
companies they place them in.  Some of the contracts are horrendous in
<br>
that they assign all IP rights over the work performed that are not
<br>
explicitly nailed down  by the hiring company to the consulting
<br>
company.  These and the termination restrictions are as onerous as for
<br>
full-time positions.  Again, some of the firms find  they can get away
<br>
with this.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So is there currently a deep shortfall in IT workers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt it.  IT workers currently are going unemployed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks to months (when dot-coms fold) and salaries are starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to decline.  I'd say that is the key measure of whether or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a 'shortfall'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Funny then that my company cannot find a handful of good people in the
<br>
midst of this supposed plenty.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I dunno. Is this report that I quote merely a means of shortchanging USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; workers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the so-called 'shortage' existed when dot-com'ers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't staff their startups.  Now I doubt that is the case.
</em><br>
<p>You are mistaken.  The shortage was present before the dot-coms and has
<br>
not disappeared when the dot-coms went away or when firms started laying
<br>
off staff.
