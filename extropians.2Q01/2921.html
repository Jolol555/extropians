</em><br>
<p>Spudboy, I think Jerry Mitchell addresses this well in his post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the point this is making isn't that its a paradise (yet :P), &gt; but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that its getting better in many ways and that it doesn't take a  &gt; lot of

<em>&gt;extrapolation to see where its headed in general.
</em><br>

<br>
<p>As he says, the point is not to imply that Somalia is a wonderful place to 
<br>
be, but only that things *are* getting better, and it's interesting to note 
<br>
that they're getting better in the absence of the &quot;help&quot; of foreign aid 
<br>
workers, NGOs, the UN, etc.
<br>
<p>If you write off the whole developing world as just a &quot;third world 
<br>
backwater,&quot; as you seem to be implying, then you fail to distinguish between 
<br>
those where things are stagnating or getting worse, and those where things 
<br>
are actually looking up.  I think it's an important distinction to make; 
<br>
after all, just thirty years ago Singapore was basically a third world 
<br>
backwater.
