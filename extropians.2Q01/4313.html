One thing that throws everything out of kilter is, as you've 
<br>
suggested, expediency. The best tech may not win. The most logical 
<br>
progression may not happen. If, for instance, the best tech which 
<br>
leads to the most logical progression is owned by a company which is 
<br>
a complete blockhead, the tech loses out to something perhaps 
<br>
inferior and more expensive--but aggressively pursued by someone else 
<br>
who wanted the fastest way to make money from waiting customers. If 
<br>
it's the first or only option for the customers, the inferior tech 
<br>
may win and the prediction is out the window.
<br>
<p>Politics and cultural factors bollix up predictions as well.
<br>
New discoveries, of course. And unforseen dead-ends.
