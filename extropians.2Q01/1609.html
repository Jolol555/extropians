<em>&gt; Sure, you'd apparently get the right behavior as output.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the real Eugene would no longer be with us.  Right now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask him a question, and the wheels really turn.  A great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal of logic and calculation occurs, where, significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of information flows from state to subsequent state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in this lookup table, there is no actual calculation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At each point in time, you merely form the enormous 10^30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit long address; say 10^10 bits for the input this milli-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second, and 10^20 bits for his current state, and voila!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You fetch from the computronium his next state.  But no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information flows. It's not a real calculation, I think.
</em><br>

<p>Just to bring an implicit assumption to the surface... this is the point of
<br>
view that the act of calculation, iterative process, imperative methods, are
<br>
the basis of consciousness. That consciousness does not come from the
<br>
substrate itself (wetware, hardware, magicware), or from some ineffable
<br>
eternal soul, or some other such construct, but as a by-product of the act
<br>
of calculating. Personally, I don't think that's as clearly true as is
<br>
implied by many.
<br>
<p>Something to consider about lookup tables; the giant Eugene Leitl lookup
<br>
table cannot learn. If you give him an entirely foreign set of inputs,
<br>
you'll go looking for actions in your lookup table, and either come up blank
<br>
(Eugene blue-screens), or get some default  behaviour(s), which would only
<br>
be appropriate initially. Eugene is a smart guy... he'd adapt to and learn
<br>
about his new environment, which would ultimately affect his behaviour.
<br>
<p>The model of the lookup table needs to be altered to allow it to be altered.
<br>
You possibly need a meta-lookup table, with the rules about how Eugene
<br>
learns, and all input and output, including from Eugene's own actions, and
<br>
modeled thoughts (they must be included as actions in the lookup table) must
<br>
be processed through the meta-table, which would produce instructions for
<br>
altering the original table on the fly, so that Eugene can change and learn.
<br>
Of course, these actions must also be able to alter the meta table.
<br>
<p>But perhaps we are only talking about putting the tabulated Eugene into
<br>
situations identical to those that the real Eugene has experienced. In this
<br>
case, you wouldn't need learning possibly, as long as an input to the lookup
<br>
table is time...
<br>
<p>At time x, in situation y, Gene does Z
<br>
At time x', in situation y, Gene does Z'
<br>
<p>That starts to make the whole table construct very brittle indeed...
<br>
<p>But, assuming that it can still work... is it conscious? I've seen no
<br>
argument to suggest that it is any more or less conscious than the original
<br>
Gene.
