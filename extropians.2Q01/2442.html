<em>&gt; There are growing numbers of us that take these issues to heart. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have long thought about starting a retail store where everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available was &quot;Made In America&quot;. I think these would prove far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular than many people think.
</em><br>
<p>It's a good idea, but why stop there?  How about a &quot;Made in Nebraska&quot;
<br>
store for Nebraskans, and similarly for other states?
<br>
<p>Or better still, &quot;Made in Dubuque&quot;, &quot;Made in Palm Springs&quot;, &quot;Made in
<br>
Talahassee&quot; stores, etc.
<br>
<p>In fact, this whole business about trade is a bunch of nonsense, really.
<br>
Why give your money to someone else when you can keep it right here at
<br>
home.  Build and make everything yourself: shop at your own &quot;Made at My
<br>
House&quot; store and you won't ship any of your money off your own property.
<br>
<p>If it's good to keep your money within your country, surely it's even
<br>
better to keep it within your state, better still within your city,
<br>
and best of all within your house.
<br>
<p>Hopefully the fallacy here is clear: the advantage of trade is that
<br>
it allows people in different areas to specialize in different things.
<br>
This is more efficient and less wasteful than trying to do everything
<br>
locally.  The wider the range of talents and resources available, the
<br>
greater are the opportunities for finding the best possible match of
<br>
people and production.  Trade on a worldwide basis maximizes available
<br>
resources for everyone.
<br>
<p>The most efficient system is one where you buy the goods that are
<br>
cheapest, regardless of where they are produced.  Anything else is just
<br>
throwing money away.  You're hurting yourself and those around you by
<br>
boycotting trade opportunities.
<br>
