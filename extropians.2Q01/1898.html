<em>&gt;&gt; Here is a puzzle that I formulated on this subject that's fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A great mathematician is at a party, and two students come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; up to him. One says, &quot;I have found a proof that Goldbach's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Conjecture is unprovable!&quot;. The mathematician snorts, &quot;Go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; away, you crackpot&quot;. Then the other student says, &quot;I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; found a proof that whether or not there exist infinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; many prime pairs is unprovable!&quot;, and the mathematician's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; eyes light up and he says &quot;Oh, really!? Please tell me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more!&quot;.  Why was the mathematician eager to hear out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; second student, but not the first?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Goldbach's Conjecture is that every even number is the sum of two primes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If it is false, there must be an even number which is not the sum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two primes.  If such a number exists, then by showing it we could show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that GC is false and GC would not be unprovable (that is, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provably false).  For GC to be unprovable, therefore, would mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no such number exists.  But this is simply the statement of GC itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so to show it to be unprovable (undecidable) is to show it to be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hence you can't show GC to be unprovable.
</em><br>
<p>This is what I had in mind.  In other words, suppose that
<br>
there was a proof that GC could not be proved or disproved.
<br>
Then since it could not be disproved, it means that you
<br>
could not find any such even number.  But since one might
<br>
pick any even number, that in turn would imply that there
<br>
is no even number that is not the sum of two primes.  But
<br>
that would prove the theorem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However we can imagine a weaker set of axioms, one which does not allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us to make all the proofs we have now.  I don't know enough mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to give a specific example, but by analogy think of Euclidean geometry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without the parallel postulate.  You can still make a lot of proofs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just not all of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's conceivable that in this weaker axiom system, we could show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;GC is unprovable.
</em><br>
<p>But I would suppose that in the weaker system, you would still
<br>
have even numbers, and so might possibly disprove the conjecture
<br>
by picking one and exhaustively (but finitely) trying all prime
<br>
sums below it.  So I don't see the analogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, how does this fit with the original argument above, which seemed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sound?  Again, think of the analogy to Euclidean geometry minus the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parallel postulate.  For a long time it was thought that this set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;axioms might fully characterize the plane, and people spent years trying
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;to derive the parallel postulate from the others.  However it turned out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that this was wrong; this truncated geometry does not fully characterize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the plane.  There are non-planar systems which satisfy the remaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;axioms but which behave differently with respect to parallel lines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The truncated axiom system leaves a certain ambiguity with respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certain kinds of questions.
</em><br>
<p>The first four postulates together with the fifth do characterize
<br>
the &quot;plane&quot; and nowadays this is what we mean by &quot;plane&quot;.  On a
<br>
plane, it's true that there exists only one parallel line through
<br>
a point parallel to a given line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;After all, intelligent men for centuries still thought that the parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;postulate might follow from the others.  We could be making a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mistake about the completeness of our arithemetical axiom systems.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed we do or are, in the following sense.  No one has yet
<br>
written down axioms that capture the integers exactly as we
<br>
know them.  So I submit that integers are unlike the plane
<br>
in this sense.  (The Peano postulates, for example, do not
<br>
exclude the existence of super big integers that are like
<br>
ordinary integers except that if you start counting from 1,
<br>
you can never get to them.)
<br>
<p>We seem to have been happy to conclude that we had nailed
<br>
down our prior conception of &quot;a plane&quot;, but we (platonists)
<br>
realize that the integers---already out there waiting for
<br>
our observations (I am heartened by Chaitin being a platonist,
<br>
or so Jim F.'s article would seem to indicate)--- the integers,
<br>
have not been captured (yet?).
