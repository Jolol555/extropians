<p><em>&gt;Cassini *should* have a Webcam so that we can see the vantage point of &quot;We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are transhumans&quot; as the Extropic Art Manifesto recedes ever-farther into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space. 
</em><br>
<p>First: do you care where it points? If not, then Great. Your next
<br>
problem would be data-rate. if yes, then Not-so-Great. Welcome to the
<br>
world of Spacecraft Observations Planning, which, for Cassini, is
<br>
especially difficult since the spacecraft is crippled in its pointing
<br>
capabilities.
<br>
<p>Unlike some other spacecraft like Galileo and Ulysses, where the
<br>
instruments are mounted on a rotating portion of the spacecraft, so
<br>
that *all* instruments have 360-degree viewing (with the occassional
<br>
magnetometer boom obstructing some of the FOV), Cassini has none.
<br>
This lack of a rotating portion was a NASA cost-saving measure some 10
<br>
years (?) ago.  Therefore, if any instrument on Cassini wants to look
<br>
in a particular direction, then it has to compete with the other dozen
<br>
instruments. Mission planning is generally done years in advance, with
<br>
a huge (and ongoing) effort by members of the instrument teams: they
<br>
must submit their observational requirements in detail, in a
<br>
particular format by a particular date, then meetings and meetings are
<br>
held with key managers, and the merits of each scientific goal are
<br>
discussed and somehow one or several instruments are given priority
<br>
over another for that time slot. The large bandwidth instruments like
<br>
the imaging system often win over the others because of its good PR.
<br>
<p>Our group's Cassini CDA dust instrument is low-requirement, low
<br>
bandwidth instrument with respect to some of the others and sometimes
<br>
we really need to fight to have our observations. At Saturn, probably
<br>
even more fighting will be required: For example: If we want to look
<br>
at the dust in Saturn's E-ring, and the Imaging system wants to look
<br>
at the dust in Saturn's E-ring, what then? The two instruments are
<br>
located about 120-degrees apart in Cassini's viewing boresight.
<br>
<p>Regarding Cassini's datarate.. there are currently two downlinks per
<br>
week (100 kilobit/s ?) which currently wouldn't make a webcam possible
<br>
(unless you would be happy with a static picture for half of the
<br>
week). So then I suppose this problem might be addressed by Eugene's
<br>
notice of that Interplanetary Internet protocal.
