<em>&gt; Maybe its just my paraoid streak, but with the reports of hoof and mouth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease spreading to livestock around the world, from Saudi Arabia to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces....
</em><br>
<p>Good theory, but I don't think so in this case.  The disease does crop up
<br>
here and there without terrorist intervention.  This latest outbreak has not
<br>
appeared in multiple places simultaneously.  All infections can be traced to
<br>
infected beef from other farms.  They have traced back to a single farm
<br>
where the epidemic is believed to have started.  If it was a terrorist
<br>
attack, it was a single point of infection which was not any more pervasive
<br>
than the natural disease might have been.  I would assume that terrorists
<br>
would have chosen to infect a major feed company or something more
<br>
effective.
<br>
<p>Actually, this kind of epidemic has long been predicted.  Because of the way
<br>
that beef by-products are mixed in the feed for other cows, it has long been
<br>
known that a disease outbreak like Mad Cow disease would spread very
<br>
quickly.  This is why US beef has been banned in the UK.  It is ironic that
<br>
they are having this problem first, since they were more afraid of the US
<br>
starting this epidemic.
<br>
<p>CNN reported that about 100 people have been infected with Mad Cow disease
<br>
in Europe.  They used to tell people to go ahead and eat the beef because
<br>
the disease did not affect humans.  Unfortunately, we now know that this
<br>
isn't true.  Humans can get the brain disease, and it is totally incurable.
<br>
All infected people die from insanity and loss of nervous-system control.
<br>
<p>CNN also claims that while the disease does not usually jump between
<br>
species, it could be possible for sheep to carry the disease after eating
<br>
beef-based feed.  These sheep are assumed to be healthy, and the milk from
<br>
the sheep is assumed to be safe, but the fear is that any cow that eats the
<br>
sheep by-products could then become infected.  In other words, sheep can be
<br>
carriers of Mad Cow disease.  (The fact that humans have caught Mad Cow
<br>
disease shows that cross-species infection is definitely possible.)
