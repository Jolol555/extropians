<p><p><em>&gt;By 2007?  Does anyone here really think this is going to be listened to?
</em><br>
<p>I predict that NASA will never have a lunar base or mars base. If there's 
<br>
ever a NASA trip to Mars, they'll plant a flag and go home and never return. 
<br>
If there's ever a lunar base it will be established by colonists and later 
<br>
ones by private enterprise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sad thing is, in 10 years time people will complain about &quot;whacky&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Scientists &quot;predicting&quot; a moon base back in good old '01.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the meantime, what would be the pros and cons of a Lunar as opposed to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Martian base?  Luna would be nearer, but wouldn't Martian gravity be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better?  Would we be in a situation of having to &quot;justify&quot; a Lunar base
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like needs to be done for ISS?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Cons:
<br>
- There is no carbon or nitrogen, and very little hydrogen.
<br>
- The long lunar night would require lots of batteries, or a nuclear plant.
<br>
Pros:
<br>
- We know that we have the technology to do it today.
<br>
- It's only a couple days trip between Earth in case there is an emergency 
<br>
and food or equipment needs to be sent, and there wouldn't be much 
<br>
muscle-rot during the trip.
<br>
- You wouldn't need as many solar panels since you'd be getting much more 
<br>
light, and it wouldn't be filtered through an atmosphere.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
