<p>Researcher Challenges a Host of Psychological Studies
<br>
<p>By ERICA GOODE
<br>
<p>Here is the problem, as Dr. Linda Bartoshuk sees it: Say that two men,
<br>
call them Richard and John, are both suffering from depression, and a
<br>
researcher wants to find out if a particular medication will offer them
<br>
relief.
<br>
<p>Asked to rate the intensity of his depression on a scale of 1 to 10,
<br>
Richard selects a 6. John, given the same rating scale, also picks a 6.
<br>
But does he feel the same degree of depression as John?
<br>
<p>Many researchers, said Dr. Bartoshuk, a psychologist at the Yale
<br>
University School of Medicine and an expert on taste perception, assume
<br>
the answer is yes, that, in effect, a 6 is a 6 is a 6.
<br>
<p>But in fact, Dr. Bartoshuk said, nobody really knows, since depression,
<br>
like many internal experiences, is subjective.
<br>
<p>And therein lies an error that compromises many psychological studies,
<br>
she
<br>
believes, perhaps calling their findings into question.
<br>
<p>Dr. Bartoshuk has described the error which pops up in studies of
<br>
everything from depression and taste perception to pain, prejudice,
<br>
eating
<br>
disorders and self-esteem at several professional meetings. And she has
<br>
written several papers detailing how the mistake is made.
<br>
<p>But not all of her colleagues have reacted with gratitude.
<br>
<p>&quot;There seems to be a lot of venom,&quot; Dr. Bartoshuk said. &quot;I've gotten
<br>
nasty
<br>
letters that basically said I was a moron.&quot;
<br>
<p>As Dr. Bartoshuk describes it, the problem is simple but easily
<br>
overlooked. It creeps in, she says, when researchers use a common
<br>
measurement technique, the rating scale, to compare different people's
<br>
subjective experiences. Undetected, it can produce distorted or even
<br>
backward results.
<br>
<p>The problem can be corrected if studies are properly designed to take
<br>
account of the relative nature of the subject's responses, Dr.
<br>
Bartoshuk
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>But in a review of eight volumes of the journal Physiology and Behavior,
<br>
<p>Dr. Bartoshuk said, she found the error in 17 of 68 human studies that
<br>
used rating scales. In some cases, the mistake completely invalidated
<br>
the
<br>
studies' findings, she said.
<br>
<p>Mapping the inner world is the goal of much psychological research.  And
<br>
<p>for many researchers, rating scales offer a convenient method to explore
<br>
<p>what their research subjects are feeling and thinking.
<br>
<p>In a typical study, subjects are asked to indicate, by locating
<br>
themselves
<br>
on a 9- or 10-point adjective scale, the intensity of a feeling or
<br>
sensation.
<br>
<p>A scale measuring hunger, for example, might ask the subjects to rate
<br>
their appetite levels from 1 (&quot;not at all hungry&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very
<br>
hungry&quot;).
<br>
An experiment on taste perception might invite ratings of the taste
<br>
intensity of a particular substance from 1 (&quot;very weak&quot;) to 9 (&quot;very
<br>
strong&quot;).
<br>
<p>Rating scales are highly effective when researchers want to find out how
<br>
<p>the same subjects' feelings, attitudes or sensations change over time or
<br>
<p>in different situations. A psychologist, for example, might ask a group
<br>
of
<br>
subjects to rate how depressed they felt, give them six weeks of
<br>
psychotherapy, and then have them repeat their ratings to see how
<br>
helpful
<br>
the therapy was.
<br>
<p>The scales are also useful when researchers randomly assign subjects to
<br>
different groups giving each group a different drug, for example and
<br>
compare the results.
<br>
<p>But many investigators also use rating scales for another purpose:  they
<br>
<p>want to know how two groups of subjects, who differ in some way,
<br>
experience things differently. A researcher might ask, for instance,
<br>
whether men were more jealous than women, whether cocaine addicts craved
<br>
<p>cocaine more than smokers craved nicotine, or whether people with
<br>
different psychiatric diagnoses suffered from similar or different
<br>
levels
<br>
of depression.
<br>
<p>And this, said Dr. Bartoshuk, is where the mistake begins.
<br>
<p>Such studies, she said, rest on the notion that the adjectives that mark
<br>
<p>the points on the rating scale mean the same thing to everyone.
<br>
<p>But the reality is just the opposite: because internal experiences are
<br>
subjective, the same adjective may mean something very different to
<br>
different people.
<br>
<p>A famine victim's &quot;very hungry,&quot; for example, probably indicates a level
<br>
<p>of hunger far higher than the &quot;very hungry&quot; of a Fortune 500 C.E.O.
<br>
questioned an hour before dinner. Similarly, &quot;very depressed&quot; likely
<br>
suggests an emotion far more extreme to a person suffering from manic
<br>
depression than to someone whose emotional life is generally on an even
<br>
keel.
<br>
<p>&quot;Everybody knows that adjectives are entirely relative,&quot; Dr. Bartoshuk
<br>
said, &quot;yet scientists pick up these adjectives and use them on scales
<br>
like
<br>
they are absolute.&quot; Or, as she posed the question in a recent article,
<br>
&quot;How `awful' is `awful,' and is my `awful' the same as yours?&quot;
<br>
<p>In some studies, the fact that two subjects may interpret a scale
<br>
differently makes little difference, because what the scale measures is
<br>
not central to the goal of the study.
<br>
<p>But in other cases, the assumption that people who choose the same
<br>
adjective mean the same thing by it can wreak havoc.
<br>
<p>Some of the most striking examples of this, Dr. Bartoshuk has found, are
<br>
<p>in taste research, where the confusion has obscured important
<br>
differences
<br>
in perception that have an effect on diet, and thus upon health.
<br>
<p>Her own studies, for example, focus on genetic differences in taste
<br>
perception. In particular, Dr. Bartoshuk has identified three different
<br>
types of tasters: supertasters, medium tasters and nontasters.
<br>
<p>Supertasters not only live in a much more intense taste world than
<br>
medium
<br>
tasters or nontasters, she has found. They also have a higher density of
<br>
<p>taste buds on their tongues, providing a way for researchers to easily
<br>
recognize them.
<br>
<p>But a funny thing happens if an experimenter tries to compare the taste
<br>
experiences of supertasters and nontasters using a traditional rating
<br>
scale.
<br>
<p>A &quot;strong&quot; taste for a supertaster is much more intense than a &quot;strong&quot;
<br>
taste for a nontaster. In fact, supertasters are operating on a much
<br>
larger taste scale altogether, with a higher intensity ceiling and a
<br>
greater distance between points.
<br>
<p>But when the ratings of supertasters are recorded on the same scale as
<br>
those of nontasters, these differences in perceived intensity are
<br>
obscured. Large differences between the two groups look smaller. And
<br>
small
<br>
differences disappear altogether, or even appear to go in the opposite
<br>
direction.
<br>
<p>As a result, some researchers, using traditional rating techniques, have
<br>
<p>failed to find large differences between supertasters and nontasters,
<br>
even
<br>
for substances, like the chemical known as PROP, to which supertasters
<br>
are
<br>
known to be especially sensitive.
<br>
<p>Dr. Bartoshuk and other investigators by using methods that get around
<br>
the
<br>
subjectivity problem, like asking subjects to anchor their responses by
<br>
referring to an entirely independent scale have been able to demonstrate
<br>
<p>large differences.
<br>
<p>While Dr. Bartoshuk suspects that the rating scale mistake may be most
<br>
common in studies of sensory perception, two social psychologists, Dr.
<br>
Monica Biernat of the University of Kansas and Dr. Melvin Manis of the
<br>
University of Michigan, have uncovered the same problem in their own
<br>
field, in slightly different form.
<br>
<p>In a series of studies, for example, Dr. Biernat and Dr. Manis have
<br>
shown
<br>
that researchers cannot assume that subjects always mean the same thing
<br>
when they apply descriptiions like &quot;tall,&quot; &quot;aggressive&quot; or &quot;financially
<br>
successful&quot; to others.
<br>
<p>Rather, the meaning of such words shift, depending on whether the person
<br>
<p>being described is male or female, white or African-American, or belongs
<br>
<p>to another group that is often stereotyped.
<br>
<p>In one study, for example, the subjects were shown photographs of men
<br>
and
<br>
women at a farmer's market and asked to rate how financially successful
<br>
they believed the person in the photo to be.
<br>
<p>Men and women in the photographs were rated as equally successful by the
<br>
<p>subjects, Dr. Manis said. Given the same photos and asked how much money
<br>
<p>the person in the photograph earned, however, the subjects judged the
<br>
women to have lower salaries than the men.
<br>
<p>Similarly, a man and a woman may both be rated as &quot;very tall.&quot; But when
<br>
people are asked to guess the height of the man and the woman in feet
<br>
and
<br>
inches, they will judge the man to be taller.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a little bit of a paradox,&quot; Dr. Manis said. &quot;In much of our
<br>
language, these adjectives are adjusted to fit the category you're
<br>
talking
<br>
about.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;You can say, `I know about a large chihuahua and, amazingly, you can
<br>
fit
<br>
it into a small car,' &quot; he added. &quot;It's because the meaning of the words
<br>
<p>`large' and `small' depend on whether you are talking about cars or
<br>
chihuahuas.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. S. S. Stevens, a renowned psychophysicist at Harvard, made the same
<br>
point 40 years ago, writing that, &quot;Mice may be called large or small,
<br>
and
<br>
so may elephants, and it is quite understandable when someone says it
<br>
was
<br>
a large mouse that ran up the trunk of the small elephant.&quot;
<br>
<p>Like other early developers of scaling techniques, Dr. Stevens, who
<br>
pioneered a method called &quot;magnitude estimation,&quot; did not use his scale
<br>
to
<br>
compare the responses of different groups of subjects: if scientists do
<br>
not know whether they are dealing with elephants or mice, Dr. Stevens
<br>
realized, it becomes anyone's guess what small and large really mean.
<br>
<p>The difficulties of such comparisons also became evident early on to
<br>
cross-cultural researchers, who found they had to take into account the
<br>
different shades of subjective meaning that colored their subjects'
<br>
views
<br>
of the world.
<br>
<p>Dr. Douglas Wedell, an associate professor at the University of South
<br>
Carolina and an expert in rating scale methodology, recalled a study in
<br>
the 1940's that asked people from many different countries to locate
<br>
themselves on a &quot;ladder of happiness.&quot;
<br>
<p>The researchers, he said, were startled to discover that the desperately
<br>
<p>poor residents of famine-torn regions of India rated their happiness at
<br>
close to the same level as American suburbanites whose homes were
<br>
stocked
<br>
with modern conveniences and who always knew where their next meal was
<br>
coming from.
<br>
<p>&quot;Across the world, just about everybody was happy,&quot; Dr. Wedell said,
<br>
though what exactly happiness meant obviously differed greatly from
<br>
culture to culture.
<br>
<p>The scaling mistake that Dr. Bartoshuk has drawn attention to, he
<br>
agreed,
<br>
&quot;is a major error that you'll find in major places.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet not everyone agrees. When a piece about Dr. Bartoshuk's concerns
<br>
appeared in The Monitor, a publication of the American Psychological
<br>
Association, for example, one letter writer sneered, &quot;It seems likely
<br>
that
<br>
the response to the problem is small because the problem is, too.&quot;
<br>
<p>Other colleagues, Dr. Bartoshuk said, dismiss the error as rare.
<br>
<p>Still, when she explains the situation at meetings, she said, people
<br>
often
<br>
look at her illustrations and gasp.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's one of those `aha!' experiences,&quot; Dr. Bartoshuk said. &quot;This is all
<br>
<p>terribly obvious when you think about it. The question is, how did such
<br>
mistakes get into the literature?&quot;
