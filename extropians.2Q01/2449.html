<p>
ARE THE CRYPTO WARS OVER?
<br>
PRIVACY, DIGITAL SECURITY, AND THE FUTURE OF ENCRYPTION POLICY
<br>
<p>featuring
<br>
<p>Steven Levy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Author, &quot;Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government --
<br>
Saving Privacy in the Digital Age&quot;
<br>
<p>Bruce Schneier
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Author, &quot;Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several decades, individuals and organizations concerned
<br>
with
<br>
protecting their personal privacy and corporate secrets have been
<br>
engaged in
<br>
a heated battle with government officials to gain the right to freely
<br>
employ
<br>
encryption techniques and technologies to safeguard their information.
<br>
While they have won important victories and forced the government to
<br>
liberalize controls, it remains an open question whether strong
<br>
cryptography
<br>
is enough to protect privacy from the many threats posed by an
<br>
increasingly
<br>
digital world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are federal standards and regulations needed in addition to
<br>
strong
<br>
crypto
<br>
to safeguard personal and corporate information?  And have we really
<br>
seen
<br>
the end to government efforts to restrict private cryptography?  Do
<br>
domestic
<br>
and international threats to crypto freedom still exist?  In their new
<br>
books, Steven Levy and Bruce Schneier attempt to provide answers to
<br>
these
<br>
elusive questions.

<p>Dear Declan,
<br>
<p>You have featured notices of upcoming events in the past to your list,
<br>
and
<br>
we would be most grateful if you could please do so for our upcoming
<br>
seminar with David Friedman (professor of law and economics, Santa Clara
<br>
University; son of Nobel Laureate economist Milton Friedman), &quot;Will
<br>
Encryption Protect Privacy and Make Government Obsolete?&quot;
<br>
<p>For your convenience, I am adding below a notice on the program.
<br>
<p>Please advise me with any questions.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>

<p>WILL ENCRYPTION PROTECT PRIVACY AND MAKE GOVERNMENT OBSOLETE? -- Next
<br>
Independent Policy Forum (4/24/01)
<br>
<a href="http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/010424ipf.html">http://www.independent.org/tii/forums/010424ipf.html</a>
<br>
<p>Many people have wondered how technological progress will affect
<br>
political
<br>
and civil freedoms. With the rise of encryption software and the FBI's
<br>
Carnivore e-mail snooping program, this subject is no longer the
<br>
exclusive
<br>
domain of speculative thinkers or futurists, it is the subject of
<br>
intense
<br>
public-policy debate. Will privacy-enhancing technology improve faster
<br>
than
<br>
privacy-threatening technology? Should the government mandate privacy
<br>
standards? Should it enforce contracts in cyberspace, or would private
<br>
law
<br>
do a better job? Economist and legal scholar DAVID FRIEDMAN will discuss
<br>
these and related questions about technological change and the case for
<br>
and
<br>
against government involvement.
<br>

<br>
<p>Praise for LAW'S ORDER: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It
<br>
Matters (Princeton University Press, 2000):
<br>
<p>&quot;Simply put, [LAW'S ORDER] is fabulously written, and readers will very
<br>
much appreciate the lucid style, the humor, and the hold-nothing-sacred
<br>
(except, perhaps, the market!) approach.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- STEVEN G. MEDEMA, coauthor, Economics and the Law: From Posner to
<br>
Postmodernism
<br>
<p>&quot;The author is a talented and provocative writer, with a great
<br>
imagination
<br>
and the ability to make readers swallow the often counterintuitive
<br>
conclusions of economics as common sense. The book is an entertaining
<br>
tour
<br>
through the mind of someone who has fully absorbed the 'economic way of
<br>
thinking' as he attempts to explain and grapple with questions of social
<br>
organization.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- PETER BOETTKE, George Mason University
<br>
<p>&quot;[LAW'S ORDER] is wide-ranging in scope, at once simple and highly
<br>
sophisticated consistently provocative, an excellent read, and a notable
<br>
contribution to an exciting field of interdisciplinary studies.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- RICHARD A. POSNER, Chief Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit
<br>
<p>&quot;Whether one speaks of the complexities of marginal deterrence, the
<br>
resolution of disputes between farmers and railroads, or the social
<br>
functions of copyright and patent law, Friedman's book provides the
<br>
outsider to the field with a comprehensive but accessible account of his
<br>
legal subject matter.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- RICHARD A. EPSTEIN, University of Chicago School of Law
