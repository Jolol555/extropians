<p>We haven't reached the bottom yet.  The fact that the universe is

(dark matter) demonstrates that quite will.

<p><em>&gt;Curt, you have said this several times in several different ways

</em><br>
<em>&gt;NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPLETE UNIVERSE.  The simulation can be on
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If they sim &quot;just&quot; a brain, they also must sim the input to that brain.
<br>
It's that *input* which displays such extraordinary consistency, depth,
<br>
breadth, and complexity.  As hard as we look, that input shows the
<br>
full complexity of a universe behind it.  So the input requires a
<br>
universe sim, or something equivalent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;According to Gwen Jacobs at a recent NSF meeting on terrascale computing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would require 1 month of Petaflops computing power to simulate 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;second of brain time (now I don't believe for correct -- I think it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much worse (i.e. computing requirements are greater) if you are doing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But it is being simulated on a quantum scale!  You can't explain interactions
<br>
with radiation (including light) otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The net of this (based on the very questionable assumption from Gwen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jacobs) is that you get a factor of a trillion greater efficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by migrating your uploads from atomic simulations (much slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than us) to human mind equivalents (much faster than us).
</em><br>
<p>Makes sense to me.  That's why I say if we were sims, we'd be human
<br>
mind sims, not quantum ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You don't have to sim the entire universe.  You only have to sim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the I/O and mental functions of the number of non-zombies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you want to put in it!
</em><br>
<p>True, but that I/O is the bitch.
