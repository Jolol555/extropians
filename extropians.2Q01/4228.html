I want to give my best wishes to Brent Allsop as he endeavors to reach out 
<br>
to the LDS church leadership to learn what he can expect from them in 
<br>
regards to cryonics.
<br>
<p>I would like to thank Anders for the excellent advice he gave on how to
<br>
improve the letter.  It is very important to avoid confusion and offense.
<br>
<p>I expect the church to reject the idea of being listed as a contactee in any 
<br>
cryonics contract.  But, a definitive reply from the church's senior 
<br>
hierarchy which does not outright condemn cryonics could help mormon 
<br>
cryonicists(like me) a great deal.
<br>
<p>I realize church leaders may see cryonics as a sign of weak faith.  I see it 
<br>
as the ultimate in life extension and not a sure doorway to absolute 
<br>
immortality.  I definitely look forward to learning the reaction Brent gets.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
