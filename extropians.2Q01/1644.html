<p>
Is happiness &quot;just a drug&quot;? I think this question shows the widespread
<br>
romantic and slightly dualist assumption that there exists &quot;authentic&quot;
<br>
emotions and other mental states, and then there are &quot;fake&quot; emotions
<br>
which are in one way or another inferior to the authentic ones. When
<br>
you start looking for it, you quickly see that the search for
<br>
authenticity in our culture is widely lauded, often to the extent of
<br>
ignoring the quality of the results since the assumption many people
<br>
start with is just that authentic stuff always is better than
<br>
artifice. This is of course one reason why we get so much opposition
<br>
when it comes to our environmental and morphological views - they are
<br>
not &quot;authentic&quot;.
<br>
<p>In reality, our mental processes seem to be &quot;just&quot; a very complex
<br>
pattern of biochemical interactions. Happiness is just as much a
<br>
chemical signal as my thoughts when I am writing this or the
<br>
production of ACTH in my hypothalamus - but they are vastly different
<br>
interactions, and differ in complexity to an enormous degree. 
<br>
<p>I don't see this as bad, or removing the basic value of human life and
<br>
emotion. This is just how things are. The complexity and magnificient
<br>
results of these interaction give rise to endless wonderment for me -
<br>
in fact, a dualist explanation would be a let-down compated to this
<br>
one, since it is so much less elegant.
<br>
<p>If I affect my brain with some drug, it can at present only do a crude
<br>
change in some part of the chemical network, like blocking or
<br>
activating a family of receptors, increasing/decreasing re-uptake of
<br>
some neurotransmittor etc. This is of course most effective when
<br>
trying to affect a simple subsystem. But information is information;
<br>
there is no reason to regard equivalent changes in our mindstate
<br>
brought about by drugs or an emotional experience to be subjectively
<br>
different. If I become happy through a drug, someone stimulates my
<br>
right frontal lobe or because I hear a joke, I am still happy. That is
<br>
what matters.
<br>
<p>Of course, given the simplicity of current drugs they have serious
<br>
limitations and will often not provide much &quot;depth&quot; to the mood
<br>
change. Mood and emotion have complex cognitive aspects, and this is
<br>
something current drugs cannot achieve yet. This is why cognitive
<br>
therapy plus medication works better than just medication (or therapy)
<br>
on its own - you get out of the depression, and learn coping
<br>
strategies to retain your newfound better mood. 
<br>
<p>There is no inherent reason why one method should be viewed as better
<br>
or worse than any other, empirical studies and practical applications
<br>
will determine that, not any views on authenticity versus
<br>
artifice. But we still live in a culture that views a antidepressant
<br>
pill as something deeply suspicious while respecting meditation.
