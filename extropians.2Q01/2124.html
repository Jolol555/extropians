This seems a bit dubious to me as well. Perhaps it's an overstatement for
<br>
effect. I do know that there's no actual &quot;education K-16 system&quot; here.
<br>
Education in California is divided into various K-12 school districts, the
<br>
Community College system, and two university systems, the Universities of
<br>
California (like UCLA) and the California State Universities (like Fresno
<br>
State).
<br>
<p>As for the &quot;total mess&quot; Ralph is referring to, I'm at a loss as to what he
<br>
means by this. As we all know, no large governmental system works perfectly (or
<br>
even very well), but sweeping generalizations about a state with (I think) more
<br>
than 20 million people are a bit disingenuous at best. I work for a rather
<br>
large &quot;small town&quot; school district that has very high academic standards and
<br>
has turned out quite a number of excellent and well-educated students. This
<br>
doesn't mean that there aren't exceptions (both with teachers and students),
<br>
because there are always exceptions to everything. This also happens to be an
<br>
area where roughly half of the population are not native English speakers,
<br>
unemployment usually hovers around 22%, and the median income for a family of
<br>
four is around $20K. To say that teaching here is a challenging occupation
<br>
would be an understatement.
<br>
<p>As for the community college system, my wife happens to teach for a small
<br>
college in the system and has similar challenges. And even though many of the
<br>
students that reach her have limited reading &amp; writing skills, I can tell you
<br>
for a fact that no one graduates who can't read. That would be ridiculous.
<br>
Additionally, I can tell you that I have never met a harder working and more
<br>
dedicated faculty (and I've worked for two large state universities, in two
<br>
other states). The obstacles they face on a daily basis are staggering, but
<br>
most of their students graduate with the ability to read and write at the
<br>
college level (or else they don't make it), and with enhanced critical thinking
<br>
skills. This is a major accomplishment in an area where many of these students'
<br>
parents didn't even graduate from high school (and many still don't speak
<br>
English).
<br>
<p>Since my experience with California education is limited to these two places,
<br>
both of which are in a small, rural community where people often see education
<br>
as the only way they and their children are going to have a chance to better
<br>
their lives, I may be missing something that is going on in other areas of the
<br>
state (it's a big state) where people may be more cynical about education.. I
<br>
would be interested in hearing more specifics about this incident (or
<br>
incidents), as it definitely concerns and perplexes me.
