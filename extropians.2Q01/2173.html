In a message dated 4/10/01 7:45:43 AM Pacific Daylight Time, 
<br>
<em>&gt; Agnosticism and modern religion run in the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; water of dealing in undisprovables, as opposed to those who prefer several 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand year old claims about easily disprovable stuff to believing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disproof.  Creationists are as empty of faith as agnostics, because they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rely on material proof. Where they differ is that they don't do good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
I think two points need be made here:
<br>
1.  Creationism no doubt began with some people that were truly shocked at a 
<br>
new idea..  Today however the leaders of that group IMHO are power grabbing 
<br>
bigots that want to use religion as a means to power.  The bankrupt nature of 
<br>
their position can most easily be seen by looking at the very Bible they 
<br>
claim as their authority.  Ladies and Gentlemen their &quot;proof&quot; does not bear 
<br>
scrutiny.
<br>
2.  Science is only involved as a whipping boy.  The target was and remains 
<br>
their congregations and the unwashed.  Scientists make good whipping boys.  
<br>
The bigot leaders can say what they like because the scientists never take on 
<br>
the bigots arguments where the bigots are weakest.  Witness how they bigot 
<br>
leaders keep winning year after year in the popular culture and in the 
<br>
legistlatures.  They don't win because they are strong but because you never 
<br>
answer.
<br>
