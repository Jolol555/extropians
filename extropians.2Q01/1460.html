<p>Yes, I generally leave them when they turn into bureaucratic nightmares. :-)
<br>
You may be correct that the large companies are not happy with the
<br>
quality of the resumes they are receiving.  However it depends a
<br>
lot on what stage of growth they are in.  Oracle for example, years
<br>
ago, would take significant fractions of the C.S. graduates from MIT
<br>
every year.  Now they are laying people off.  [Corporate environments
<br>
change significantly when growth rates decrease from 100%/yr to
<br>
more realistic rates like 10%/yr.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oracle and Microsoft on one side and fluf-headed dot-com
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bubble-babies on the other heh?  What a false dichotomy! 
</em><br>
<p>Well, people do tend to use illustrations that make the point of their
<br>
arguments... :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>Samantha, your expertise in this area [employing non-citizens in
<br>
the U.S.] seems greater than mine and I will defer my comments to
<br>
yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Funny then that my company cannot find a handful of good people in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; midst of this supposed plenty.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps this is a regional situation?  The overabundance I was refering
<br>
to was based on an article largely discussing S.F. and Seattle.  Of
<br>
course if you are in those areas and having this problem then I'm
<br>
a bit baffled.  Perhaps your firm isn't viewed as 'cool' enough
<br>
by all the young people being recycled by the dot-com hiccup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are mistaken.  The shortage was present before the dot-coms and has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not disappeared when the dot-coms went away or when firms started laying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off staff. 
</em><br>
<p>I'd agree that your statements are consistent with what the article said
<br>
that highly skilled people are still in high demand.  However you generally
<br>
cannot fil those positions with foreign citizens because they are unlikely
<br>
to have the required experience.
<br>
