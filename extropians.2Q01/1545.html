<p>Sure, but structure also does mean dynamics, including interaction.
<br>
Static structure alone is rather sterile, though it does aid in docking
<br>
studies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3D protein structural analysis but its going to take another 3-5 years

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>One also needs to create new forcefields of suitable accuracy and

performance. Not an easy task.
<br>

<em>&gt; I've seen a presentation by Lenat, and he nicely documented an analytical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem solved by their approach that was not solved by humans.  And
</em><br>
<p>Right, but I was mentioning robust AI (i.e. naturally intelligent systems),
<br>
not stupid theorem proving. If it can prove Goldbach's conjecture but not
<br>
find its way out of an open paper bag, that's not naturally intelligent, that's 
<br>
idiot savant at best (and even these typically do manage to feed themselves
<br>
on their own).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of course I know you are aware of the group at either ORNL or Argonne
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that has proved mathematical conjectures that were previously unproven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (computers can exceed the depth of thought (most) humans seem capable of.)
</em><br>
<p>If you consider that a proof might translate into a man-century (or 
<br>
man-millenium) of hard work with zero error tolerance, that appears 
<br>
rather cheap. Assuming I scale up Deep Blue to a cubic meter of computronium,
<br>
it will play like a demigod, but it has progressed only along a single,
<br>
very special axis.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Minsky pointed out at the same conference that Lenat was speaking at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain may use a dozen or so 'heuristics' to determine the distance
</em><br>
<p>The wording is just broken. There is no algorithmizable heuristics in
<br>
there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and size of an object it 'sees'.  We have yet to see a computer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporates those dozen strategies and effectively learns to select
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between conflicting results.
</em><br>
<p>The hardware is almost there (at least in terms of raw transistor count), 
<br>
but the software has just stalled. We're obviously at the threshold
<br>
of a breakthrough, however long it may take. The future is definitely
<br>
in biomimetic and ALife, albeit it's a tad slow to deliver.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'd strongly doubt you can call what they are doing 'snake OIL'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are laying the foundation in different areas for parrallel or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even novel ways of doing some of the things that the brain does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Divide and conquer.
</em><br>
<p>I think they're caught up in the 5th sidetrack of then 10th 
<br>
sidetrack. I don't expect anything from that edge of AI but
<br>
more debacles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if you want true self-conscious AI --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [NOTE: And here I will make a prediction -- &quot;When&quot; we understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely what 'consciousness' is; we will say 'Is that all it is?'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it will cease to hold the &quot;high&quot; position that it now does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of discussions like 'rights', 'simulations', 'zombies',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  We will view 'consciousness' as just something else the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do -- just as the visual neural system has the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assemble lines, merge them into complete 'shapes', map them onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognizable objects, etc.]
</em><br>
<p>I don't care what it is, and how is it called, and how to make it
<br>
as long as it delivers.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; -- then IMO you need to look carefully at what William Calvin has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been saying about the need to simulate yourself as the actor in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the internal view of the 'scene'.  That combined with a better
</em><br>
<p>Sure, you've got to have a self representational system, and a future
<br>
trajectory planning unit (most likely, massively parallel). That's 
<br>
a basic chestnut. I've know that much in highschool.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; understanding of how one 'talks to oneself' will yield the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.
</em><br>
<p>That's an unproven fact, whereas we know that darwinian evolution
<br>
can create intelligent systems.
