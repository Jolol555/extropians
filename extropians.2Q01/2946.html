Who would've thought there would be such a market for flabby,
<br>
fluorescent tanned geeks....:&gt;
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.inlandempireonline.com/news/ap/20010423/CA_Porn_Haven_22806N.shtml">http://www.inlandempireonline.com/news/ap/20010423/CA_Porn_Haven_22806N.shtml</a>
<br>
<p><p>It wasn't too long ago when porn executives faced many recruiting
<br>
challenges. One of the biggest, they say, had been matching promises of
<br>
stock-option bonanzas and early retirement by Internet firms.
<br>
<p>But that was more than a year ago, before the NASDAQ tanked and dot-coms
<br>
collapsed. The fallout has been a boon for adult entertainment, Vivid
<br>
Entertainment Group President Bill Asher said.
<br>
<p>&quot;At least I know my paycheck isn't going to bounce,&quot; said Jon, 25, who
<br>
asked that his last name be withheld. Jon told the Times that he jumped
<br>
to
<br>
take a Web designer job at Vivid after he was laid off last winter from
<br>
Los
<br>
Angeles music start-up ArtistDirect Inc.
<br>
<p>The company, which makes up to six adult videos a month and recently
<br>
expanded its online team, says that 35 percent of its technical staff
<br>
hail
<br>
from the dot-com world.
<br>
<p>Jon now spends eight hours a day digitally covering up female nipples
<br>
for
<br>
the company's front-page, which entices visitors to pay for the full
<br>
peep
<br>
show. &quot;My mom would kill me if she knew,&quot; he said.
