<p>That is unclear -- is quantum mechanics the bottom or string theory

the bottom?  What is all the &quot;dark energy&quot; that is now all in vogue
<br>
in the most recent papers?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the appeal to unimaginably powerful beings with mysterious

</em><br>
<p>Curt, you have said this several times in several different ways
<br>
in several letters and I've commented on it once or twice, as has
<br>
Eugene and I believe a few others.  Get this: THE SIMULATION DOES
<br>
NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPLETE UNIVERSE.  The simulation can be on
<br>
any scale from a single brain to that of the universe.
<br>
<p>According to Gwen Jacobs at a recent NSF meeting on terrascale computing,
<br>
it would require 1 month of Petaflops computing power to simulate 1
<br>
second of brain time (now I don't believe for correct -- I think it is
<br>
much worse (i.e. computing requirements are greater) if you are doing
<br>
and atomic or quantum scale simulation, but thats another discussion)..
<br>
<p>For our purposes here, we will assume this is correct.  That translates
<br>
to ~3x10^30 Ops to do a real-time simulation of a single human brain.
<br>
Given the 10^42 ops available in an MBrain, that means you can support
<br>
almost a trillion simulated human brains (~126 human civilization
<br>
equivalents at our current population level [IF you were simulating
<br>
the entire civilization!!!]).  Conversely you could be doing nothing
<br>
but running a trillion Curt Adams simulations.  Now, if 100 human
<br>
civilizations will not give you the statistics you need, you simply
<br>
build your MBrain around a star of about 50 times the mass of the
<br>
sun and that will get you enough power to run half a billion human
<br>
civilization simulations.
<br>
<p>An interesting tidbit falls out of this in that it suggests you can't
<br>
run a whole brain simulation on a Drexlerian rod-logic 1 cm^3 nanocomputer
<br>
in real-time.  You would have to slow it down by about a factor of a
<br>
billion to run it in the NC (or run a tightly linked net of NCs).
<br>
<p>You may also note the efficiency you get if you run &quot;human mind equivalents&quot;
<br>
(the figure I typically quote is a trillion trillion HMEs in our solar system,
<br>
though its likely to be more.  This is because if the worst case estimates of
<br>
brain capacity are correct, you get ~10^5-10^7 HMEs per NC.  HMEs are where
<br>
you effectively do what the brain does but use a combination of software+hardware
<br>
that does it more efficiently (e.g. Moravec's &quot;vision&quot; systems).
<br>
<p>The net of this (based on the very questionable assumption from Gwen
<br>
Jacobs) is that you get a factor of a trillion greater efficiency
<br>
by migrating your uploads from atomic simulations (much slower
<br>
than us) to human mind equivalents (much faster than us).
<br>
<p>Quite interesting.  Certainly suggests a fair amount of job security
<br>
for future programmers and neuroscientists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the entire universe has been simmed but some super-universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures as an experiment, they are not our descendants.  Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're simming the whole shebang and not us; we're just an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epiphenomenom and our actions won't make them turn it off.
</em><br>
<p>You don't have to sim the entire universe.  You only have to sim
<br>
the I/O and mental functions of the number of non-zombies
<br>
you want to put in it!
<br>
<p>Paraphrasing some great physicist Curt, you are not even wrong.
<br>
<p>Note that I doubt these differences (if you want to maintain them) can
<br>
be resolved in this low bandwidth channel.  You may simply have to come
<br>
to Extro5 and listen to the discussions there.
<br>
