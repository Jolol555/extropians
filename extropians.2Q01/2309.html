<em>&gt; God was a hyper-intelligent geek kid in another universe that cooked up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this mess on what in his society is rigtheous but not terribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impressive home computer-ware.  Eventually it evolved into this here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff. There certainly is a universe, as long as his machines stay up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or he remembers to keep backups. :-)
</em><br>

<p>The question has been raised as to whether it would be possible to create a
<br>
universe in a (well equipped) laboratory.
<br>
<p>Such a possibility was investigated by Edward Farhi and Alan G. Guth in
<br>
Physics Letters, 183-B, (1987), p. 149, as &quot;An Obstacle to Creating a
<br>
Universe in the Laboratory&quot;.
<br>
<p>They concluded that &quot;to create conditions in a small region of space which
<br>
would give rise to a new universe (...) would require an energy density that
<br>
is far too high to be provided by any known technology&quot;.
<br>
<p>Henry Margenau (in &quot;Thomas and the Physics of 1958: A Confrontation&quot;,
<br>
Marquette U.P., 1958) wrote that the creation of universe from nothing is
<br>
possible if the total energy of universe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E = Mc^2 - (k/R)x(GM^2) = 0
<br>
(where M = u. total mass, R = u. radius, c = c, G = gravit. const.)
<br>
that is to say: if the numerical factor k = 10, and that is, perhaps,
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>Actually Thomas (Aquinas) already pointed out (in &quot;Quaestiones Disputatae&quot;,
<br>
3-6) that &quot;Dicendum, quod tenendum est firmiter, quod Deus potest facere
<br>
aliquid ex nihilo et facit&quot; that is &quot;that God can and does make something
<br>
from nothing should be steadfastly held&quot;.
<br>
<p>Others suggested the indeterminacy principle argument, linked to the
<br>
relation E = 0, that is to say: can a quantum fluctuation create a universe?
<br>
Among these:
<br>
- Edward P. Tryon, &quot;Is the Universe a Vacuum Fluctuation&quot;, Nature, 246,
<br>
(1973), p. 396
<br>
- Edward P. Tryon, &quot;What Made the World&quot;, New Scientist, 101, (1984), p. 14
<br>
- A. Brout, F. Englert, E. Gunzig, &quot;The Creation of the Universe as a
<br>
Quantum Phenomenon&quot;, Annals of Physics, 115, (1978), p. 78
<br>
- D. Atzkin, H. Pagels, &quot;Origin of the Universe as a Quantum Tunneling
<br>
Event&quot;, Physical Review - D, 25, (1982), p. 2065
<br>
- A. Vilenkin, &quot;Creation of Universes from Nothing&quot;, Physics Letters, 117 B,
<br>
(1982), p. 25.

<br>
<p>&quot;What did God do before He made Heaven and Earth? I do not answer as one did
<br>
merrily: He was preparing Hell for those that ask such questions. For at no
<br>
time had God not made anything because time itself was made by God&quot;.
<br>
