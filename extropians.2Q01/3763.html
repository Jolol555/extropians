You don't really need to know that 
<br>
<p>P(Ai|B) = [P(Ai)P(B|Ai)]/P(B)
<br>
<p>(it probably doesn't help).  But it certainly helps to
<br>
consult your imagination for the following problems.
<br>
<p>1.  There are two bags, each with 10 coins.  Half the coins
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the first bag are counterfeit, and all the coins in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second bag are counterfeit.  Someone hands you a bag,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you happen to pull a coin out of that bag and examine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.  If you see that the coin is counterfeit, what is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probability that you were handed the counterfeit bag?
<br>
<p>2.  A little girl's father discovers that his wife is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pregnant again (but they don't know the sex of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unborn child).  The man decides to visit a mathematician.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have two children, sir&quot;, he says, &quot;and one of them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a girl.  What is the probability that the other is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a boy?&quot;  What did the mathematician tell him?
<br>
<p>3.  You're on the Monte Hall show, and there is a big prize 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind one curtain, and junk prizes behind the other two
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curtains.  You pick one of the three at random.  Monte
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then opens one of the other curtains and shows you a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;junk prize, and asks if you still want to keep playing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say, &quot;Yes, but let me switch my choice to the other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curtain!&quot;.  Monte says, &quot;That's weird,&quot; but allows the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;switch.  What is the probability of your getting the big
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prize?  (As is widely known, Marilyn Vos Savant humiliated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some experienced mathematicians with this old problem.)
<br>
<p>4.  You wash up on a desert island where it is known that Long
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Silver has hid a lot of gold in one of three strongly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;built shacks.  You begin dismantling one of the three.  A
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lightning bolt comes out of the overcast sky and strikes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the other shacks, destroying it and revealing that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gold wasn't there.  What is the probability that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gold will turn up in the shack that you are not working on?
<br>
<p>Hint:  one of the answers is 1/2 and the others have the same
<br>
answer.
