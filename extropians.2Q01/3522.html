</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At minimum a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer language survey class, data structures class, computability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory class, compiler class and an OS class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I'd drop the computability class, replace it with something on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms + algorithmic complexity. Also, parallel &amp; distributed computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a must-have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Without a theory of computation class it is difficult to understand and
<br>
evaluate what is and is not possible or what is actually being done in
<br>
computation.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Also, libraries &amp; environments can be more important than languages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, in my opinion. It is easier to move between two different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages with the same libraries/environment, than it is to move between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two implementations of the same language with different environments (eg:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; javascript vs vbscript vs n-many other languages on IIS is easy. Borland's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; VCL &lt;-&gt; MFC is not so easy.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The unifying element above is a component architecture such as COM or
<br>
CORBA rather than the libraries themselves.  COM is relatively
<br>
proprietary to the Microsoft world and languages while CORBA is much
<br>
more universal.   Yes, components help a lot.  But to produce and use
<br>
components you still need knowledge of languages and general language
<br>
concepts.  In addition you need the characteristics and limitations of
<br>
components, component environments and the implied language that is
<br>
implicit in the sorts of APIs and operations supported by the component
<br>
environment.   As an implementor you need to know how to create
<br>
components yourself in some language[s] of choice.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'd highly recommend Java these days, specifically because of the J2EE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specification for enterprise computing. The resources provided by that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment let you get as close as possible to industrial strength
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applications, without the usual heterogeneous hell-on-earth that accompanies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar efforts. You can start very small with Java, and go very large, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere in between.
</em><br>
<p>J2EE is a swiftly moving target.  EJB 2.0 specs have some pretty scary
<br>
limitations and gotchas including a need to avoid any cycles in
<br>
session/entity bean calls (or the results are undefined).  As a
<br>
long-term designer of middleware and server systems I find a lot to
<br>
question and dislike in J2EE.  It is by no means ready for primetime and
<br>
I can produce witnesses who tried it wholeheartedly who will testify to
<br>
its problems.  
<br>
<p>Ask Ben Goertzel about the apporpriateness of Java for very large
<br>
systems.
<br>
I have already shot off my mouth here and elsewhere enough about the
<br>
pokey, boring simple-mindedness of Java.
