I first read David Deutsch's book, &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;
<br>
in 1997, and, although I was very impressed with his exposition
<br>
of MWI (the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum theory), I
<br>
was skeptial of the relevance of quite a bit of it.  For
<br>
example, he devoted an entire chapter to &quot;Virtual Reality&quot;,
<br>
which at the time seemed to me to have nothing to do with
<br>
the main thrust of the book.  Moreover, about a quarter of
<br>
the book appeared to me to be plain wrong.
<br>
<p>Later in the book, he went off on a tangent exploring time
<br>
travel, again, which struck me both as not germane, and also
<br>
a bit, yes, flaky.  This was true even though I had two main
<br>
advantages over most readers:
<br>
<p>* I already was very familiar with MWI and had accepted it
<br>
* I was already well-acquainted with evolutionary epistemology,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which, although he doesn't call it by that name, David 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deutsch fully explains in his chapter about falsifiability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Popper), and how bad &quot;justificationism&quot; is.
<br>
<p>However, I reread &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; last summer with
<br>
excruciating care.  I believe that I have studied that book
<br>
more than any other book I've read in ten years.  I found 
<br>
that as I closely examined each of the approximately one
<br>
thousand very carefully written paragraphs of the book, I was
<br>
slowly coming to see things in exactly David Deutsch's way.
<br>
<p>One by one, dozens of unconscious assumptions that I had
<br>
had about physical reality and my place in it were undermined
<br>
and refuted.  I began to see exactly why &quot;virtual reality&quot;
<br>
had to play such a prominent role in the book.  Also, despite
<br>
the hundreds of conversations I've participated in about
<br>
virtual reality---all of which would be very familiar ground
<br>
to extropian readers---everything that David Deutsch was saying
<br>
was thoroughly correct, and I was left with virtually nothing
<br>
to disagree with him about.
<br>
<p>If you have read &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;, and your reactions
<br>
were somewhat as mine were when I first read it, you may be
<br>
interested in giving it another try.
