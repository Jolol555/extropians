<p><em>&gt;&gt;Force experts got their first close-up took at Russia's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;first-line fighter aircraft-and what they saw impressed them.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;As I recall they were not all that impressed. Yes, it was faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than anything the USA  had at the time but it maneuvered like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;truck not a sports car and it was heavy, very heavy, thus it had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an extremely short range; the Bozos made it out of steel not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;titanium. Whatreally flabbergasted them was forget integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circuits or even transistors, the avionics used vacuum tubes! Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in 1976 that was archaic.
</em><br>
<p>As any high end stereophile can tell you, tubes can do things
<br>
neither transistors nor integrated circuits can do, it has to do
<br>
with the total numbers of electrons involved with the large surface
<br>
area of the collectors. Sync-slew rate amongst others.
<br>
<p>Those boxes proved highly resistant to conventional ECM protocols,
<br>
and new protocols were developed, or so I heard....
<br>
<p>I wasn't surprised at all by the Chinese treatment of the plane, in
<br>
fact after the MIG-25 precedent it's exactly what I expected. The
<br>
power move would have been to get the crew out of there
<br>
immediately, by commercial air/first class would have been a slick
<br>
trick. Then when asked about the plane they could have smiled
<br>
enigmatically and merely said. &quot;You will get it back.&quot;
<br>
<p>I still remain perplexed at exactly why the pilot landed it there,
<br>
either he broke protocol, (unlikely) or the plane isn't all that
<br>
secretive, or we thought we had a better understanding with China.
<br>
<p>After all China also conducts these flights.
