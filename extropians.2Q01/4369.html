<em>&gt; I think what is needed is honesty, less bullshit from journalists

and  scientists and promoters of this or that. Or if they are 
<br>
promoters of X or Y,  let them state it clearly.
<br>
<p>Clearly stated: I'm a promoter of nanotechnology as the solution to 
<br>
most of our problems and the means to the realization of most or all 
<br>
of our aspirations.
<br>
<p>Clearly stated: I think more likely the damned thing will kill us all-
<br>
-so I'm a bit ambivalent about speeding things up.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;:)
<br>
<p>And, obviously, there'll be no stopping it, so we might as well face 
<br>
the beastie and do our best.
<br>
<p>I also think it entirely conceivable that a completely nonbiological 
<br>
consciousness (which is what most seem to be thinking of when they 
<br>
refer to AI/SI) may be flat-out impossible. &quot;Self-awareness&quot; as 
<br>
generally discussed in relation to AI/SI is not consciousness.* A 
<br>
computer which interprets data and makes logical decisions based upon 
<br>
those data is not displaying consciousness. A computer which passes 
<br>
the Turing Test is a parlor trick; the test itself is meaningless 
<br>
because its definition of intelligence is meaningless.
<br>
<p>You may well ask for a definition of consciousness.
<br>
Well, hey--if you gotta ask...
<br>
<p>jm
<br>
<p>*Simple example: Computer detects heat which will damage its 
<br>
components, and eliminates the heat source or moves components away 
<br>
from it. Another: Computer discovers way to improve its source code 
<br>
(because it has been programmed to do just this), and does so. This 
<br>
is &quot;consciousness?&quot; I think not.
<br>
<p>Of course, consciousness is not a necessary component of the SkyNet 
<br>
scenario.

&gt; &lt;&lt; My meaning was that there may BE no &quot;long term.&quot; We'll be 
&gt;  extraordinarily fortunate to stagger through another century. &gt;&gt;
&gt; I understand your suggestion of many threats to human and biotic existence, 
&gt; be a Spike or a Nuke or Global Warming or whatever.  
&gt; 
&gt; We may indeed wind up in the shit can of annihilation, but that has been 
&gt; pimped before by many journalists and Paul Ehrlich in the Population Bomb, 
&gt; the Club or Rome, and the rest, including neonazi survivalists of the 1980s 
&gt; and such.  I would suggest that the human species will survive, and that it 
&gt; may, well, have to deal with problems, that have to do with dealing with 
&gt; &quot;Skynet scenarios.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I hold with George Dyson's more convivial view that we will be part of what 
&gt; makes SIAI work, but it will take astronomically, more computational power, 
&gt; then even Kurzweil has suggested. For example; look how much computer 
&gt; capability have increased over the last 20 years, and it is having an impact, 
&gt; but nothing that has approached the science fiction of a William Gibson, or a 
&gt; Bruce Sterling.  
&gt; 
&gt; We do suck at environmentally friendly technology for energy and using raw 
&gt; materials. That is largely a part of the marketplace, and how it interweaves 
&gt; with human psychology. Why split water for hydrogen fuel cells, if gasoline 
&gt; is so cheap (circa 2000)?  Why make hydrogen fuel cells, if the old, IC 
&gt; engine is the only thing to drive? You get the idea, its all linked.
&gt; 
&gt; Pessimism as such, seems to be worse for a society, especially a democracy 
&gt; (republic) then optimism. People who are pessimistic settle for less and are 
&gt; less critical of their &quot;leadership.&quot; People can also turn to psychotic types 
&gt; of leadership, out of a sense of desperation.
&gt; 
&gt; I think what is needed is honesty, less bullshit from journalists and 
&gt; scientists and promoters of this or that. Or if they are promoters of X or Y, 
&gt; let them state it clearly.
&gt; Peter Jennings is happy to editorialize (American Broadcasting Company) while 
&gt; he reads the news. Verification of what he claims, is often a harder matter 
&gt; to obtain.
&gt; We need honesty to make good choices.
