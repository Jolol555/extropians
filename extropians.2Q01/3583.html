This came out yesterday.  I'm surprised no one on the list posted it.
<br>
Anyhoo, I think this is the way nanotech will take off -- i.e., by
<br>
applications that are mundane and not really directly nanoassembler related.
<br>
<p>Cheers!

<p>IBM breakthrough for making chips with nanotubes
<br>
&nbsp;from <a href="http://www.electronicstimes.com/story/OEG20010430S0041">http://www.electronicstimes.com/story/OEG20010430S0041</a>

<p>IBM claims to have made a technological breakthrough that could allow the
<br>
use of alternative materials to silicon in the production of high
<br>
performance chips.
<br>
<p>Researchers, from the company's Watson research centre, have developed a
<br>
fabrication technique, which could be the key to producing industrial
<br>
quantities of nanotube transistors.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem with producing large quantities of nanotubes has
<br>
previously been the inability to control their growth.
<br>
<p>The IBM method, called constructive destruction, removes unwanted metallic
<br>
nanotubes from the wafer while leaving unharmed semiconducting nanotubes.
<br>
These can be used as field-effective transistors (FETs).
<br>
<p>This process is faster than the nanotube production method used today, which
<br>
involves growing the tubes one by one.
<br>
<p>The research paper outlining the process was published in this week's
<br>
Science. In the article, the IBM researchers have broken down their approach
<br>
into five basic steps:
<br>
<p>1  The scientists deposit ropes of &quot;stuck together&quot; metallic and
<br>
semiconducting nanotubes on a silicon-oxide wafer.
<br>
<p>2  A lithographic mask is projected onto the wafer to form electrodes (metal
<br>
pads) over the nanotubes.
<br>
<p>3  These electrodes act as a switch to turn the semiconducting nanotubes on
<br>
and off. Using the silicon wafer itself as an electrode, the scientists
<br>
&quot;switch-off&quot; the semiconducting nanotubes, which essentially blocks any
<br>
current from travelling through them.
<br>
<p>4  The metal nanotubes are left unprotected and an appropriate voltage is
<br>
applied to the wafer, destroying only the metallic nanotubes, since the
<br>
semiconducting nanotubes are now insulated.
<br>
<p>5  The result is a dense array of unharmed, working semiconducting nanotube
<br>
transistors that can be used to build logic circuits.
<br>
<p>IBM hopes to get the technology to a point where it can be used in
<br>
mainstreame chip manufacturing within three years.
