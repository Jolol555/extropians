<br>
<p>Didn't Greenspan publicly note that our GDP, although 2 (or 5?) times greater

than that of a few decades ago, weighs the same?
<br>
<p>So imagine someone then, saying &quot;it'd take 3 planets to live as Americans now,
<br>
and imagine what it'd take to live twice as well!  You progress freaks have

your heads in the sky!&quot;

<p>Daniel Dennett, and maybe Kevin Kelly, have abstract points here, although
<br>
Kelly can sound nuts to normal people in specifics.  Darwinian processes are
<br>
an algorithm for chugging through design space toward better designs for one's
<br>
environment.  It's speeded up from Darwin's &quot;breed and die&quot; to Skinner's &quot;try
<br>
that and die&quot; to Popper's &quot;imagine that and don't die&quot; to our &quot;did you hear
<br>
about the guy who strapped rockets to his car?  Don't do that!&quot;  But unless
<br>
the processes are suspended or supressed -- and people critical of
<br>
Anglo-American hegemony are usually happy to criticize us for being overly
<br>
Darwinian -- stasis is not an option.  
<br>
<p>Actually I could drag in Jane Jacobs and her _Cities and the Wealth of
<br>
Nations_ to counter my own simplistic argument, but for now let's just say
<br>
that people who complain about the inhumanly competitive marketplace and also
<br>
extrapolate linear trends blindly aren't being logically coherent.  If
<br>
something's being too Darwinian for your tastes, it's not going to stand still
<br>
in the face of changing circumstances.  And you're predicting that
<br>
circumstances will change, right?
<br>
<p>(I'm reminded of Galbraith's mockery of the Marxist capitalist -- infinitely
<br>
subtle and powerful in oppressing the workers, but utterly blind and immutable
<br>
regarding his ultimate fate, plunging heedlessly to destruction.)
