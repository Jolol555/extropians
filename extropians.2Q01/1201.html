</em><br>
Why not pitch your ideas/words for the language on the back of the T-shirt?&lt;&lt;  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Natasha, how about some off the wall irreverent T-shirts as
</em><br>
well as the more serious (simple or artistic) ones?  I'd love to
<br>
get a T-shirt with Eli's &quot;10 Signs the Singularity is Imminent&quot;
<br>
or whatever he called it (someone will have to get it out of the
<br>
Archives or Eli will have to repost it).&lt;
<br>
<p>I'd love to get on with &quot;Primo 3M+ 2001&quot; on it, or one with Greg Burch's posted URL's of anti-technology sites, or wouldn't it be great to have a T-shirt with with Max's &quot;Letter to Mother Nature&quot; on it!  But, I already have the design for Extro-5.  Just need some creative ideas regarding the phrase on back.  Now, we could go wild and have several kick-ass shirts, but this is Max's decision as Chair of the conference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I liked my Death-to-Death slide from Extro-4, that would make
</em><br>
a great T-shirt, but I suspect its a copyrighted drawing.&lt;
<br>
<p>I sent a post which I don't think made it to the list replying to Brian where I suggested Sasha's &quot;Enhanced Reality&quot; essay printed on the shirt and also (back or front) would have an image from his &quot;Visionary Thinkers&quot; Web site which would show Sasha's face.
<br>
<p>Next year or so, we could have a scratch and sniff, but I'd rather have a press and play -:) 
<br>
