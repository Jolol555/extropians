<em>&gt; &gt;State level legislative action is not that expensive (compared to

<em>&gt; &gt;mentioned, and a few thou to the parties themselves. This is advice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;given to me several years ago by the Chief of Staff for a former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;president of the Washington State Senate, who was a friend of mine. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;said that for minor issues like this, where an existing law gets a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rather minor amendment to it, its rather easy to slide stuff on through.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If you can get high tech industry groups to support such lobbying by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;former local pol (i.e. an insider) such things can be achieved rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;easily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, ... can you add this up?  Sounds like &lt;$30,000 - that right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What probability of success would you give for that amount?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And how do you know this is a &quot;minor&quot; law change?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's get real.  If I gave you $50,000, what penalty would you agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay me if you failed to get the bill passed?  $100,000 perhaps?
</em><br>
<p>What is this? Legislation futures? ;)
<br>
<p>$30k sounds about right, tho I'm not sure of the size of the Nevada
<br>
legislature houses and committees.
<br>
<p>It is a 'minor' law change because it simply expands the definition of
<br>
lawful things to bet on. You can be sure that the state gambling
<br>
establishment would go for it, and they already have a sizable amount of
<br>
paid-for power in the capital. The only problem would be they'd
<br>
definitely put a limit on what idea futures are legal. For example, no
<br>
futures would be allowed that involved predicting physical harm coming
<br>
to anyone, or destruction of something. Nothing about elections or
<br>
overthrowing governments (in case a candidate tries to finance their
<br>
election with futures). Nothing about passage of new laws or overturning
<br>
of existing ones.
