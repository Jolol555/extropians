</em><br>
<p>Exactly. It is a milleniarist meme I really get irritated at. It blocks
<br>
critical thinking because it both attracts us away from the present
<br>
concerns with its glorius light and blinds us with it. The credo that we
<br>
cannot know anything beyond it is an excuse for lazy thinking, and the
<br>
end time thinking it engenders is more of the type &quot;when will it occur?&quot;
<br>
than &quot;what are the options?&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For another thing about phase transition:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that from the large body of historical data we have,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're already in one, but one that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; albeit it seems instantaneous in geological times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very long in individual human life time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there's no reason to believe we're at the end of it.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly! This is my position too. That doesn't mean the rate of change
<br>
or lifespan could not become so great that we get to experience the
<br>
inflexion point of the grand sigmoid curve of history (if something like
<br>
that happens). 
<br>
<p>I don't believe in phase transitions to posthumanity started by a tiny
<br>
nucleus (other than that ideas and inventions have to come from
<br>
somewhere, and this is where the entreprenurs of thought are needed),
<br>
they will encompass a large part of our society and economy. I use the
<br>
term &quot;a swell&quot; - a broad change across society, possibly taking quite
<br>
some time - rather than the elitist &quot;spike&quot; of a transition caused by
<br>
some single nucleus.
