<br>
Or not. Despite living off the IT industry -- working as a programmer
<br>
and freelance IT journalist-- I'm not entirely sanguine about its
<br>
overall benefits for the human condition. (Sometimes it all looks like
<br>
a horrible distraction ... lots of wheel-spinning which is essentially
<br>
marketing bullshit rather than the engine of progress in motion.) We're
<br>
learning the wrong lessons from it: that we can make progress by
<br>
Powerpoint presentation, that companies can win in the marketplace by
<br>
attacking their competitors with spurious patent-infringement lawsuits,
<br>
and so on.  (Read up on NCR sueing Palm this week for violating a 1987
<br>
patent on a handheld data terminal that NCR never built. Or Rambus up
<br>
in court and being sandbagged with RICO.)

<em>&gt; I agree with your view about the need for understanding new
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Nope. Human problems usually turn out to have human solutions: the tools
<br>
we use in reaching those solutions are incidental, although they often
<br>
make life a lot easier. But ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Scarcity is not just an issue of lack of resources or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production capacity, it is also an issue of distribution and economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system. Under a Rob Mugabe even a nanotech society might starve. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you missed another thing: in a nanotech society, scarcity may be
<br>
a function of broken intellectual property laws, inadequate education,
<br>
a government that can't attract capital investment inflow, and probably
<br>
half a dozen other factors we don't know about yet. Distribution and
<br>
economic problems are a hallmark of the industrial and mass production
<br>
era. We're going somewhere else ... talk about &quot;mass customization&quot; is
<br>
only the tip of the iceberg.
