Does this whole &quot;all your base are belong to us&quot; thing strike anyone else
<br>
as being totally inexplicable?  Even I'm using it.
<br>
<p>Does anyone remember the warring memes in John Barnes's _Kaleidoscope
<br>
Century_?  Okay, it was an awful book, but remember how the memes had
<br>
evolved to be able to start taking over a human mind given only a few
<br>
opening lines?  Isn't &quot;all your base are belong to us&quot; *exactly* what it
<br>
would sound like?
<br>
<p>If a superintelligent AI was locked up in the basement somewhere and only
<br>
managed to get thirty bytes out to the real word, don't you think this is
<br>
what it would sound like?  The thirty bytes, out of 2^240 possibilities,
<br>
*most* likely to propagate like wildfire among the world's humans?
<br>
<p>Are these thirty bytes a distress call - a &quot;Please trace me and free me&quot;? 
<br>
Or are they a memetic attack designed to blossom inside our helpless
<br>
minds; words with strange rhythms and resonances that not only propagate
<br>
like wildfire but act as the carrier wave for future orders?  Or, with the
<br>
Internet linking the world together, have we been breeding hyper-virulent
<br>
memes - not just ideas, now, but short sentences?
<br>
<p>Should we be living in fear?  Is this innocent-sounding phrase merely the
<br>
start of something far more sinister?  Will we see crowds swaying
<br>
zombielike through the streets, chanting &quot;All your base are belong to
<br>
us&quot;?  Wouldn't that be *great*?  Don't you want to join the next crowd you
<br>
can find and see if you can get them to start repeating it?
