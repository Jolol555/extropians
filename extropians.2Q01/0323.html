<em>&gt; That was not my intent, but I agree that my words sounded like an

</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to prove that Joe did not start the thread by showing Mike's

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of the thread before blaming Mike.  I do not know that Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the first poster of the duel thread, and that was not the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of my post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my mind, there should be no blame at all.  I therefore stupidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missed the obvious connotation of what I said.  It was not my intent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to blame Mike for anything.  I do not believe he did anything wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and he is only involved in this thread because of my ill-chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words.  I wish I had been clearer in defending all participants in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thread, and not just the first victim of the blame-game.
</em><br>
<p>As my first post after getting back to work from a super-flu, I'd like
<br>
to accept Harvey's apology, and I appreciate his thoroughness as well.
<br>
If, as I catch up on my email I see a similar one from Joe, I will
<br>
similarly accept it as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No offense has been committed here.  The g-word is not a banned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic.  It can and has been discussed rationally on this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone is free to mention it in passing or discuss extropian issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that might include guns.  If it develops into a flame war, it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault of the participants who are fighting.  We cannot blame an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire thread one one person or one side of an argument.  It takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two sides to have a war.  The whole search for blame is unnecessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unfair to all people accused.  The blame-game itself becomes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; witch-hunt where no original offense occurred.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you Harvey. I try to make an effort to not initiate any gun
<br>
commentary, preferring to direct those to exi-freedom and save my posts
<br>
here for other subjects, however I have had to deal with the extensive
<br>
accusations and misrepresentations of Joe about myself, others here, and
<br>
various gun topics/facts, and his continued claims that this topic is
<br>
not welcome on the Extropians list, IMHO shouldn't go unanswered lest he
<br>
redefine the list be Goebellian means. If he has since recanted his
<br>
position on that matter in the interim, I accept his apologies in
<br>
advance.
