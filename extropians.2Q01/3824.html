</em><br>
<p>I have seen this plan put into action many times.  In a conversation
<br>
between certain old friends, interruptions are encouraged and enjoyed.
<br>
But a moment sometimes comes in which each is rather certain, based
<br>
upon intuition honed over many years, that what he has to say will
<br>
be the more important.  So he raises the ante by raising his voice.
<br>
<p>It's exactly like you were playing poker, and you were pretty sure
<br>
that you held the higher cards.  At some point however, when your
<br>
opponent (in that case) stakes enough, your confidence begins to
<br>
waver.  You begin to suspect, again based on a very great amount
<br>
of past performance, that probably your opponent is holding the
<br>
higher cards.
<br>
<p>And it turns out to be the same in the discussion; one yields the
<br>
floor at some point, and, in the happy cases that I've seen, is 
<br>
rewarded by an especially valuable insight from the other, and
<br>
there indeed was a tendency for the final speaker to have the
<br>
slightly more important point.  (Especially since there is no
<br>
bluffing, which you have noted by specifying that the parties
<br>
&quot;are sincere and honest&quot;.)
<br>
<p>So this puts into action precisely the plan that you suggest.
