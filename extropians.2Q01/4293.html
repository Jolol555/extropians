from those who can.  Don't confuse me with bad examples :-)

</em><br>
<p>But problems that almost everyone gets right just aren't

much fun.  As my topology professor used to say, &quot;you
<br>
can't really learn anything until you get confused&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What situations do you have in mind where

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Out of all the parents who *do* say &quot;At least one

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Situations where those parents who have both a boy and a girl
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will choose at random whether to say &quot;At least one of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children is a boy&quot; or &quot;at least one of my children is a girl&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Choose at random?  Here, I suspect, is where Bayesianism comes in.
<br>
The B statisticians are happy to assume certain priors when there
<br>
is no evidence for them.  Now, I've always liked that, and feel
<br>
that in many cases it is justified, because it enables them to
<br>
give answers to questions that others shy away from (complaining
<br>
of insufficient data, etc.).
<br>
<p>But in some cases, like this, they start reading into situations
<br>
protocols that aren't needed to answer the question.  In this case,
<br>
as you say, they demand a &quot;do&quot; (and then have to conjure up what
<br>
could reasonably cause the &quot;do&quot;).  Staying with *could*, on the
<br>
other hand---which mathematicians apparently are more prone to
<br>
do---obviates further assumptions.  One simply considers sets
<br>
and subsets, and so on, and defines probability accordingly.
