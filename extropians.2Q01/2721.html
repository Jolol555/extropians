<em>&gt; Ditto on both counts here.  And let me add some evidence: when I first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw Eliezer's work, I offered to help implement part of his plan (the
</em><br>

<p>Guys, I can burn myself out trying to get everything to everyone, and all
<br>
it means is that *nothing* will ever get finished.  I'm sorry if I managed
<br>
to give you the impression that it was just a couple of weeks, way back
<br>
when, but we can't start implementing Flare until we have at least one
<br>
full-time person to run the project, and I've been too busy working on
<br>
&quot;Friendly AI&quot; - am *still* too busy - to write anything up on it.  When,
<br>
after my visit to Webmind, Ben Goertzel asked for a paper describing
<br>
specifically how to implement a Friendly Webmind using his current
<br>
architecture, I dropped everything else and got him a paper, with
<br>
diagrams, within (if I recall correctly) a week or so.  Then, in
<br>
accordance with Murphy's Law, Webmind immediately died, in order to
<br>
deprive us of the potential test case we were cultivating.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm sorry, but SIAI has a total of one full-time guy, and that
<br>
one full-time guy has other priorities.
