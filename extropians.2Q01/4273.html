<p>
Spike brings up the &quot;Unexpected Hanging&quot; (see below).
<br>
<p>The way I think of it, the prisoner wins if when the
<br>
judge comes into his cell, the prisoner is (a) not
<br>
surprised, and (b) can explain logically to the judge
<br>
why he is not surprised.  Otherwise, he loses.
<br>
<p>Now the prisoner wins if, as Spike relates, the judge
<br>
shows up on Friday and says &quot;ah ha!&quot;.  The prisoner
<br>
calmly retorts that since the sentence has to be carried
<br>
out on one of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or
<br>
Friday, (if it is to be carried out at all), and since
<br>
the first four are now impossible, the judge has failed
<br>
to surprise him, and so he must go free.
<br>
<p>But would you believe the prisoner if you came for him
<br>
on Thursday, and he made the following argument? &quot;Your
<br>
Honor, I knew that you would come today.  Why?  Because
<br>
it was clearly stated that you were to surprise me.  As
<br>
is easy to see, you could not surprise me if you came
<br>
tomorrow.  Therefore it was obvious, as soon as I got up
<br>
this morning, that today would be the day, so you have
<br>
failed to surprise me, so I get to go free.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unlike Spike's claim, the resourceful prisoner says 
<br>
something quite similar, but more elaborate, on Wednesday
<br>
as well (since Friday and Thursday are clearly crossed
<br>
off as possibilites).
<br>
<p>Explaining exactly where and how the prisoner goes wrong
<br>
isn't easy.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;A prisoner is sentenced to the ultimate punishment.  He is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;told his execution will take place on some unspecified day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Monday thru Friday inclusive.  The judge specifies that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prisoner will not know which day he is to meet his fate until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the day of his demise.  Sitting forlornly in his cell, it occurs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to him that his date with destiny cannot be on Friday, for if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he is still among the living on Thursday midnight, then he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would *know* he is to be executed on Friday, which violates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the judge's stipulation that he will not know the date of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;execution.  Similarly, he cannot be executed on Thursday, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he already determined his date cannot be Friday, so if he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still with us on Wednesday midnight, then similarly Tuesday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;midnight, and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The prisoner determines by this line of reasoning that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;execution cannot take place according to the judge's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instruction.  A greatly relieved prisoner is startled by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hangman, who shows up Wednesday morning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Surprise!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Those that are following this thread and the previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threads regarding probability of record primes, do ponder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this apparent paradox of the unexpected hanging so you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be ready for where I am going with the notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probability distribution functions and their relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the unexpected singularity.  Comments and questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;welcome in the meantime, while I go sample sushi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restaurants.  {8^D  0====   spike
