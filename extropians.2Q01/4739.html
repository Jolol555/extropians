<em>&gt; Yes, I see your point. Isn't one group enforcing their will onto

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the Democrats and Socialists and Big Government are all
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>True.  But I also believe that Republicans, the Religious Right and
<br>
Conservatism are also about enforcing their will onto another group.  I'm
<br>
not sure why people tend to promote one side or the other as being more
<br>
pro-freedom.  As far as I can tell, they both try to control me to follow
<br>
their agenda instead of letting me be free to choose my own way.  Although
<br>
this always feels better if the powers that be are closer in agreement to
<br>
your own viewpoints, the loss of freedom is just as real.
<br>
<p>The Right promotes the Christian religion while the Left promotes the
<br>
new-age Gaia/Nature religion.  The right blocks freedom of speech about
<br>
sexual issues while the Left blocks freedom of speech about politically
<br>
incorrect issues.  The Right wants to control your body as far as sexual
<br>
orientation, drugs or reproduction is concerned, while the Left wants to
<br>
control your body as far as self-defense.  The Right pushes the NRA and Big
<br>
Oil rhetoric while the Left pushes psychobabble and social agendas.  The
<br>
Right wants to change our laws to promote isolationism, while the Left wants
<br>
to change our laws to promote the New World Order.  The Right wants to open
<br>
borders to business and close borders to immigrants, while the Left wants to
<br>
open borders to immigrants and close borders to business.  The Right wants
<br>
to increase budgets for the military sector while the left wants to increase
<br>
budgets for social programs.  The Right wants to cut taxes in ways that
<br>
might be skewed toward the rich while the Left wants to cut taxes in ways
<br>
that might be skewed toward the poor.
<br>
<p>I don't see any difference in tactics, attitudes or power grabs.  Both major
<br>
American Parties are using the same underhanded tactics to take away freedom
<br>
from individuals.  The both are trying to manipulate the system in the same
<br>
way for the same agendas.  They just have different backers and lobbyists
<br>
promoting for different beneficiaries at the expense of personal freedom.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want your Visual Basic automatically updated and debugged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Mr. Bill,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then try a different computer language that any number of  list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prescribe
</em><br>
<p>I do.  As a security consultant, I help my clients block Microsoft
<br>
interference to their internal operations, just as I try to block hackers,
<br>
disgruntled employees, industrial spies, and anybody else who would tries to
<br>
override corporate operations from the outside.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I heartily accept the motto, -- &quot;That government is best which governs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least&quot;; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe, -- &quot;That government is best which governs not at all&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and when men
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have. -- Henry David Thoreau
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I know that most people think the Republicans are for less government than
<br>
the Democrats, but I humbly disagree.  For the specific goals of gay rights,
<br>
drug rights (recreational drugs, smart drugs, life-extension drugs),
<br>
abortion rights, atheist rights, artistic expression rights, rights to
<br>
discuss/view sexual materials, etc., I see the Republicans as pushing Big
<br>
Brother Government control over my personal freedoms as much as the
<br>
Democrats stomp on other freedom issues.  Neither side is more pro-freedom
<br>
or pro-personal-rights.  They each just have a different list of rights they
<br>
will allow and disallow.  I wouldn't trust either side to make my personal
<br>
decisions for me.
