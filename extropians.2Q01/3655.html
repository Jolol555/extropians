<p>
When energy prices began to rise a year or so ago , almost
<br>
similtaneously with the bursting of the tech bubble I began to pose the
<br>
query.... Could a severe increase of energy costs be a deliberate ploy
<br>
to drive the masses to use electronic devices in favor of physical
<br>
transport and transaction modalities.  Accompanying this would be the
<br>
creation of a cash pool to stabilize the loss of investor liquidity
<br>
underlying the market weakness.  This same pool of cash could then drive
<br>
the investor base which would buy into the companies which would merge
<br>
with or otherwise acquire the &quot;value corrected&quot; internet businesses.
<br>
The resulting world scale internet commerce
<br>
enabled conglomerates would drive business to their door by offering the
<br>
benefits of
<br>
net integration to compete with more energy consuming and thus cost
<br>
ineffective conventional cohorts??
<br>
I know that if I was a global scale strategic planner who wanted to make
<br>
the internet sucessful I would want to create this scenario.  Global
<br>
planners want to find a way to access and analyse every human action.
<br>
Bill gates/Microsoft has created the platform for this &quot;world domination
<br>
enabling knowledge pool&quot; by offering to supply the master data
<br>
warehouse/repository system.
<br>
The good side is that the ineffiencies of  the chaos that results from
<br>
unmonitored
<br>
human actions in every area of life from medicine to business to
<br>
education might be elimenated or at least extremely reduced.
<br>
What we are moving towards is  a borg-like electronic infrastructure.
<br>
What those who want personal space and individual human thought must do
<br>
is determine just where pervasiveness of computing should end and
<br>
individual private domains begin.
<br>
There are those who would argue that privacy creates chaos and
<br>
inefficiency and thus should be disallowed.
<br>
<p>On another subject, I listened to a couple of the &quot;extropian
<br>
recommended&quot;
<br>
songs.  My impression of &quot;wild Child&quot; is that it describes the process
<br>
that might lead to the first self aware AI.  A very special virus with
<br>
the &quot;spark of life&quot;  creates a global singularity &quot;event horizon&quot; as
<br>
every electronic linked system is infected with &quot;self awareness&quot;.  In
<br>
effect the global electronic net would begin to act like a brain and
<br>
think.  So maybe the key to creating the first AI lies in creating a
<br>
very special virus.
<br>
<p>I personally think that the computational complexity which comprises the
<br>
<p>living program called a living human being will be recognized by any AI
<br>
in short order to be useful and worthy of preservation.  Wishful
<br>
thinking?
