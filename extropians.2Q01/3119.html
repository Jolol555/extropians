</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I am a bit confused.  Which users, what types of information in
<br>
annotations? I thought I understood that one of the purposes of Flare
<br>
was to enable the annotating of information, functional components,
<br>
relationships and so on in some way that enabled the AI as well as
<br>
humans to reason well and accurately about these things.  But this would
<br>
require a semantically rich and yet precise categorization and
<br>
description of all of these items.  That problem is in itself not known
<br>
to be tractable.  
<br>
<p>Of course, it would be wonderful if software components could be
<br>
described quite well not only in syntax and interaction but in
<br>
intensional terms and all of this were computable.  But I don't see how
<br>
Flare, as I understand it so far, actually solves or is a large step
<br>
toward solving this type of problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;   Attaching user supplied meta data to language constructs is trivial

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I program Python lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; [et cetera et cetera]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, Matt, while I understand that your suggestions are well-meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (lately I've come to realize that other people hypothesizing I have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once thought of something blindingly obvious are simply expecting a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; insulting), I did in fact go through several lists of the &quot;best of&quot; modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages back when I was writing my notes on Flare, looking for features
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I could skim off, and making sure I didn't miss something obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This included Haskell, Common LISP, Scheme, Smalltalk, Tcl, APL, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, in addition to C++, Python, Perl, Java, Java VM, MOO, 680x0 assembly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forth, Pascal, Prolog, and all the other languages with which I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already familiar at that time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Instead of this please show where your proposal is actually better. 
<br>
Thus far I have not seen it.  My questions are not about how much you
<br>
may have been exposed to computer language theory (although I hardly
<br>
expect you to be an expert in everything), as they are about what you
<br>
mean by your claims and what your intentions for this language are and
<br>
why you made some of the choices you did.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There are things I expect to do in Flare that I will only be able to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in, say, Python by badly reinventing Flare, like trying to write C++
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs in C.  Sure, you can implement your own virtual function tables,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but do you really want to?  Just having a picture in my mind of Flare has
</em><br>
<p>That is trivial compared to the semantic and intentional programming
<br>
problems that I believe you would like to solve and need to solve to
<br>
have the AI fully understand and self-modify its code.  As an aside, I
<br>
have written several varieties of message dispatch mechanisms in my
<br>
time.  Virtual function tables are one of the faster mechanisms but also
<br>
one of the most wasteful in terms of space and one of the least
<br>
flexible. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; already led me to write seriously different (and better) Python programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with quick-and-dirty emulated Flare behaviors.  For example, the program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I use to maintain my Webpages actually reads in fragments of Python
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code from an XML file and organizes them using the attached attributes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even without being able to use the debugger on those code fragments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's still been an improvement in programming speed just resulting from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more modular design.  &quot;Literate programming&quot; is just good writing and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features for forced documentation, not any kind of annotative programming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But a far cry from computable description of program intentions or even
<br>
full semantic and syntactic description of software components. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   I don't think though you appreciate what a enormous task
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   simply specifying a non-toy language would be or what it would take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   to improve on the state of the art.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would take a small fragment of the knowledge of cognitive science that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would take to specify a non-toy AI.  The fragment in question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge about how the human mind handles annotative thinking, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object-oriented programming is derived from a theory of how the human mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes objects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If this is all you are after I believe it is insufficient for what I
<br>
believe your purposes are. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In other words, I dispute your implied belief that all the major &quot;wins&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been used up.  I've found a collection of design patterns in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming career that are very basic, language-type features, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have found to lead to incredibly more modular and adaptable code, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I have yet to find implemented in any existing programming language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all my browsing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I saw no such implication.  
<br>
<p>Please publish them.  Allow some of us to sit at your elbow or buy you
<br>
sufficient dinners to hear all about them and write them down if you
<br>
don't have time.  What you have described so far does not seem to
<br>
require XML or even a new language.  Lisp is quite versatile at
<br>
including such additions and at turning such innovations into
<br>
information for exxamining and modifying code, testing and so on.  XML
<br>
seems to me to build in a lot of klunkiness for no real gain if use as
<br>
the basis of a language.  It makes somewhat better sense for annotation
<br>
but even here it is not as versatile as other choices.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Frankly, I see no good reason why you have a need to immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesize anything about Flare one way or the other, rather than waiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on further information.  Flare simply hasn't made it to the top of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to-do list yet, in part because people like you keep asking me to write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documents, and a lot of those requests have a higher priority than Flare.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I now politely request that you stop bugging me about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Pardon me but if you are going to make claims about a new language
<br>
system and especially say it is necessary to the work of building an SI
<br>
then people whoc are about languages and/or the SI are naturally going
<br>
to want to know a lot about what you are proposing and why.  I am sorry
<br>
if you feel &quot;bugged&quot;.  I'm not sorry about my or anyone else asking you
<br>
but quite sorry that you allow yourself to feel that way when people
<br>
express interest and ask for clarification.
