To respond to some points, according to the muslim I asked about this, it
<br>
is already the case that some Islamic countries DO allow (and fund)
<br>
research into cloning. No flame-bait intended. My point, again, is that
<br>
Islam is not monolithic, and it is relevant to discuss political issues in
<br>
regards to technology. I fully expect the US to bow to christian pressure
<br>
and make human cloning illegal. I am hoping it won't happen, and will help
<br>
to make sure it doesn't, but I still expect it to happen.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, yes, you can predict how a group of people will react (more or
<br>
less) if you group them by how they self-identify. That is, if they
<br>
identify themselves as muslims, you can generally expect them to act in
<br>
accord with Islamic rules. This will depend on who interprets the rules, of
<br>
course, but you can get a good general idea. However, since you were the
<br>
one who interpreted ALL muslims as unwilling to discuss certain ideas, this
<br>
seems self-contradictory.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you realize how insulting it is to tell people who are religious
<br>
that they have the intelligence to &quot;break out of outdated religious memes&quot;,
<br>
since they're going to interpret that as you telling them you know better
<br>
than they do? I've said it before, I'm an atheist and I think of religion
<br>
as a disease, but you can NOT deal with people (the vast majority of whom
<br>
identify themselves with a religion) by insulting them. It is this kind of
<br>
rhetoric which gets our ideas banned.

<p><p>From: &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20Politics:%20Islam%20and%20extropy&In-Reply-To=&lt;OFEEC2BB4A.5DFB8B7F-ON85256A09.00557C15@cbis.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>Trying to interact with a group of people based on projections of how they
<br>
will respond tends to insult the group because such profiling too easily
<br>
slips into stereotyping, which further offends them. People like to think
<br>
of themselves as individuals, as unique and autonomous beings, not defined
<br>
by the specifics of how they accidentally fell into the world. As
<br>
extropians, I feel we should treat all people as if they have the
<br>
intelligence to break out of outdated religious memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      If the United States bans cloning, and an Islamic country doesn't
</em><br>
<p>Do you honestly believe that a Muslim country would approve cloning before
<br>
the US does?
<br>
I doubt your sincerity in this regard, and decline the flame bait.
