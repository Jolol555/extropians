<p>
TOWARD A THEORY OF HUMAN ERROR
<br>
by Frederick Mann
<br>
<p>Feedback appreciated!
<br>
<p>POTENTIAL ORIGINS OF HUMAN ERROR
<br>
<p>The first thing to realize is that some errors have survival value.
<br>
Consider a human a thousand years ago. Fifty yards from him
<br>
he perceives what he believes to be a tree stump. He goes
<br>
closer. It turns out to be a bear, which charges and kills him.
<br>
<p>A second man perceives what he believes to be a bear. He's
<br>
actually mistaken; it's a tree stump. He takes evasive action
<br>
and removes himself from the scene. He suffers few or no
<br>
bad consequences for his mistake.
<br>
<p>If primitive man mistakes a bear for a tree stump, he tends to
<br>
die for his mistake. However, if he mistakes a tree stump for
<br>
a bear, he suffers few (if any) negative consequences, and he
<br>
survives.
<br>
<p>So, erring on the side of safety has survival value in certain
<br>
environments and areas of life. (See 'Faces in the Clouds:
<br>
A New Theory of Religion' by Stewart Guthrie

<br>
<p>John F. Shumaker has propounded the theory that certain aspects
<br>
of nature (random accidents, brutality, death) are too frightening
<br>
for most humans to confront. By distorting reality with myths, they
<br>
enjoy &quot;greater peace of mind and body&quot; and tend to live longer.
<br>
I've heard that people who regularly go to church tend to live 5-10
<br>
years longer than those who don't go to church. Another case of
<br>
error having survival value? (See 'Wings of Illusion: The Origin,
<br>
Nature and Future of Paranormal Belief'

<br>
<p>There may also be biological origins of human error. The &quot;triune
<br>
brain theory&quot; claims that the human brain evolved in such a way
<br>
that the modern human brain actually consists of &quot;three brains&quot;:
<br>
a primitive reptilian brain, a more evolved but still primitive
<br>
mammalian/emotional limbic system, and a modern neocortex
<br>
or thinking brain. Under certain conditions of stress and/or real
<br>
or perceived threat, the more primitive brain structures tend to
<br>
take over control, sometimes resulting in irrational behavior.

<br>

<br>
<p>The human biological reproductive/sex drive may lead
<br>
to errors of &quot;thinking with the sexual organs!&quot; (See
<br>
'The Breeding Motivation: What You Can Do About It&quot;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05aa.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05aa.shtml</a>&gt;.)
<br>
<p>There are two basic ways to acquire the wherewithal
<br>
to survive: 1. Produce and exchange; 2. Steal. There's
<br>
also a principle: Obtain the wherewithal to survive with
<br>
the least effort.
<br>
<p>If certain powerful humans can induce the weak to adopt
<br>
certain erroneous beliefs and habits, rendering them &quot;easy
<br>
marks,&quot; then the powerful can acquire the wherewithal to
<br>
survive from the weak with relatively little effort, and without
<br>
having to produce and exchange. Historically, it was a case
<br>
of, &quot;Bow down, call me King, kiss my feet, and pay me your
<br>
tribute, or I'll have your head chopped off!&quot; The &quot;independent
<br>
rebel spirits&quot; tended to be killed off, while the obedient,
<br>
submissive, genuflecting victims tended to survive.
<br>
<p>As a result, modern human culture includes many memes,
<br>
which if accepted and acted upon the way most humans
<br>
do, bestow great advantages to those &quot;above the memes&quot;
<br>
and great disadvantages to those &quot;below the memes.&quot;
<br>
(See 'The Anatomy of Slavespeak'
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.shtml</a>&gt;.)
<br>
<p>Conformity is also a factor. In primitive tribes, if you didn't
<br>
conform so as to be &quot;like everybody else,&quot; you risked being
<br>
kicked out, most likely leading to an early death. The conformists
<br>
tended to survive and the nonconformists tended to die off.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, some of what most humans came to conform to
<br>
were and may now be errors that became deeply instilled cultural
<br>
habits, which some modern humans may find difficult to question
<br>
and analyze. As an example, many humans ingest, as directed
<br>
by deeply instilled cultural habits, substances that eventually
<br>
cause bodily harm and early death. (This area is particularly
<br>
difficult to analyze rationally, because the consequences of
<br>
ingesting certain substances are immediate &quot;good feelings,&quot;
<br>
while the harmful long-term consequences sometimes become
<br>
manifest only after years or even decades of self-abuse.)
<br>
<p>Certain industries reap huge financial gains by propagating errors.
<br>
As an example, tobacco companies earn billions by promoting the
<br>
erroneous smoking habit.
<br>
<p>Certain &quot;professionals&quot; (such as medical doctors and lawyers)
<br>
command a great deal of power, money, and respect to the extent
<br>
that their customers are ignorant and error-prone. The economic
<br>
interest of many &quot;professionals&quot; is for their clients to be so ignorant
<br>
and error-prone that they often need &quot;expert&quot; assistance, but not
<br>
so ignorant and error-prone that they die too soon! -- the longer
<br>
the victims can be &quot;milked,&quot; the better!
<br>
<p>In evolutionary terms, the neocortex is a relatively new development.
<br>
Humans haven't had much time to learn to use it to best effect. So
<br>
we are prone to a host of logical errors in our thinking. Because of
<br>
the conformity factor, humans who share the same thinking errors
<br>
tend to band together and expel those without their errors (or with
<br>
different errors!)
<br>
<p>Philosophers such as Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and Rand have indicated
<br>
that most animals automatically develop to achieve their full potential.
<br>
Humans are different in that we need to make a deliberate effort to
<br>
develop our minds and bodies correctly. Lazy conformists who don't
<br>
make this special, deliberate, continuous effort to develop their minds
<br>
and bodies tend to stagnate in errors of relative mediocrity.
<br>
<p>AREAS OF LIFE WHERE HUMANS ARE PRONE TO ERROR
<br>
<p>In my opinion, humans generally are most prone to error in the following
<br>
areas of life:
<br>
<p>* Diet and exercise -- Many humans habitually, culturally, and erroneously
<br>
eat and drink harmful substances; many lack proper and sufficient
<br>
exercise.
<br>
<p>* Religion -- Superstitious memes proliferate and pervade many human
<br>
minds.
<br>
<p>* Politics -- Superstition abounds. The deepest erroneous political memes
<br>
are in my experience much more difficult to correct than their religious
<br>
counterparts, to which they are related.
<br>
<p>* Economics -- About 90% of businesses fail during their first year. Many
<br>
humans have personal financial problems because they are relatively
<br>
ignorant and error-prone about money.
<br>
<p>* Relationships and sex -- In some parts of the world, about 50% of
<br>
marriages fail. Some human couples (and their families) &quot;fight like
<br>
cats and dogs.&quot; (Maybe the &quot;marriage&quot; meme has become an error
<br>
-- particularly considering the risk of having to pay for alimony and
<br>
child-support, in case of divorce!)
<br>
<p>* Education -- To the extent that the powerful (who seek to acquire the
<br>
wherewithal to survive with least effort) control education, they are
<br>
likely to &quot;shape&quot; education to produce relatively helpless, ignorant, weak,
<br>
error-prone, obedient workers and worshippers who suffer from their
<br>
errors and often need &quot;professional services&quot; and &quot;welfare assistance.&quot;
