<em>&gt; What's wrong with methane? What's wrong with hydrogen, for that matter, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's made from water, using solar photons usually wasted to heat your roof?
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the extra information, 'Gene. Doesn't it cost a lot to cover your
<br>
roof with the gear to convert solar photon energy to hydrogen? I mean, if this
<br>
were a feasible alternative to paying the electric utility companies, wouldn't
<br>
Californians be doing it right now? And if it is a feasible alternative,
<br>
shouldn't we be investing in fuel cell manufacturing?
<br>
