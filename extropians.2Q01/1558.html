<em>&gt; [NOTE: And here I will make a prediction -- &quot;When&quot; we understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely what 'consciousness' is; we will say 'Is that all it is?'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it will cease to hold the &quot;high&quot; position that it now does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of discussions like 'rights', 'simulations', 'zombies',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  We will view 'consciousness' as just something else the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do -- just as the visual neural system has the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assemble lines, merge them into complete 'shapes', map them onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognizable objects, etc.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- then IMO you need to look carefully at what William Calvin has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been saying about the need to simulate yourself as the actor in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the internal view of the 'scene'.  That combined with a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of how one 'talks to oneself' will yield the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is a point I need to raise here regarding the motivation of the
<br>
&quot;zombie&quot; debate.
<br>
<p>I don't think that anyone in that main &quot;qualia&quot; camp is saying that you
<br>
*cannot* create intelligence without understanding &amp; recreating the
<br>
inneffable thing that is consciousness. Well, maybe some are, and they
<br>
should get their grant money now, it wont be there in 10 years...
<br>
<p>That's not the point. Most qualia supporters would say &quot;sure, of course you
<br>
can create intelligence&quot;. And, they would support you in doing so. No
<br>
problems. If the created creatures are lacking qualia, they'll never know
<br>
what they are missing; it wont matter to them at all, or to us.
<br>
<p>However, this debate is important in terms of uploading. When we say that we
<br>
want to take an existing, human intelligence, and move it to another
<br>
substrate (inside a machine), there is an egoistical imperitive. We don't
<br>
want to die!
<br>
<p>Suddenly, something matters which doesn't matter in any other part of the
<br>
debates of intelligence - the subjective, internal world of the subject. The
<br>
subject wants to retain his/her essential identity, self, *consciousness*.
<br>
This is entirely the point of the procedure, the deciding factor between
<br>
determining that one has died, or one has lived on.
<br>
<p>So, whatever qualia are (supposing for a moment that, indeed, they are),
<br>
they are vitally important to a person's inner world... it's their raw
<br>
interface between their essential self, and the world at large.
<br>
<p>Does that sound weird and fluffy? It is. And yet, it is vitally important.
