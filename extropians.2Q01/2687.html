Subject: what they're saying about THE SPIKE
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Truth in advertising time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's what one reader says about THE SPIKE on amazon.com:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Virtually Unreadable,
</em><br>
Really? I read it in a couple of sittings.
<br>
March 27, 2001
<br>
<em>&gt;                 Reviewer: A reader from Berkeley, CA USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 The ideas explored are fascinating, but the prose used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 exploring is wildly uneven. While there are chunks here
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; there that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 approach coherence, to a large extent the writing consists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 manic hyper-caffeinated chattiness that at times verges on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hysteria.
</em><br>
Indeed, his frenetic prose was heading straight for a
<br>
.......a.....a......spike!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                 Liberally peppered with irrelevant asides that careen from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 topic without differentiating fact from wild speculation,
</em><br>
Oh really. I thought Damien did an excellent job trying to pick through
<br>
&quot;fact from wild speculation&quot;. Of course he will be wrong about something
<br>
concerning the future, but then so will we all. Perhaps the reader has a
<br>
special divining rod for this purpose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the book is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 also repetitive and poorly edited. There's also an
</em><br>
annoying
<br>
<em>&gt; habit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 taking commonly used terms and arbitrarily coining new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; names for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 them (&quot;minting&quot; for nanotech assembly, the titular &quot;spike&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Vinge's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 singularity).
</em><br>
Time will tell whether Damien's neologisms will stick, but they are hardly
<br>
arbitrary. He provides reasons for his neologisms. (For the 'spike' see page
<br>
12ff, for minting (from molecular nanotechnology) see 18ff. If nothing else
<br>
Damien's terms have fewer syllabals--which is very important for
<br>
Australians. :)
