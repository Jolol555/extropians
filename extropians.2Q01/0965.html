<em>&gt; &quot;how can you guys live so far from the scavenging grounds, won't you starve?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>No, actually, this is like Australopithecus expressing concern for vis
<br>
future descendants:  &quot;There are only so many ways you can flake spears,
<br>
you know, and while our limited brains are so small that we can still have
<br>
fun doing it, won't these hypothetical homo saps figure out the absolute
<br>
optimal spear-flaking method in a couple of days and then spend the rest
<br>
of their lives totally bored?&quot;
<br>
<p>In a mathematically friendly universe, the lesson would be that a fixed
<br>
increment in intelligence opens up exponentially larger vistas; to put it
<br>
another way, only thirty fixed increments of intelligence are needed to
<br>
redouble the &quot;Time to Boredom&quot; from one year to a billion years, and a
<br>
superintelligence with billions or trillions of times human computational
<br>
power will never even begin to touch All The Things There Are To Do at
<br>
that level of intelligence.  A population of 1e30 ultraminds operating at
<br>
1e40 operations per second, running from the Big Bang to the Big Crunch,
<br>
will be in roughly the same position with respect to The Space of All
<br>
Possible Things as the first sentient mind alone on the savannah.
<br>
<p>A more worrisome question is whether the accumulation of useful memories
<br>
and experience requires and causes a corresponding increase in
<br>
intelligence; it takes very few additional assumptions to get an
<br>
unavoidable exponential increase in mind size, with doubling occurring at
<br>
least every subjective millennium.  Unless there's really unlimited
<br>
computational power, this could present a serious obstacle to the goal of
<br>
indefinite growth, life, and fun.  If there is unlimited computational
<br>
power, of course, then I say GO FOR IT, GREAT!
