<p><em>&gt; Now whether or not anyone would ever see fit to challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the law
</em><br>
<p>Challenging the law in the courts, as well as fighting unhealthy memes are
<br>
both worthwhile endeavors. Fighting the memes is something everyone can do
<br>
on a daily basis.
<br>
<p>There's a more immediate and direct approach we could take to try to keep
<br>
this nonsense from becoming law in the first place, or at least to limit the
<br>
scope of the law.
<br>
<p>Note to non-Americans about how we pass federal laws: Technical laws of this
<br>
nature are always referred to committees. The various anti-cloning laws that
<br>
have been introduced this year, of which I've counted 4 so far (including a
<br>
couple that would only have banned government funding of human cloning
<br>
research but would not have banned the research entirely), have been
<br>
referred to the standing Subommitte on Technology of the Science Committee
<br>
of the House of Representatives and to the Committe on Commerce, Science and
<br>
Tranportation of the Senate.
<br>
<p>Testimony before these committees can be helpful, and the text can be posted
<br>
on the Internet for the enlightenment of the public in general. I know most
<br>
of us don't have time to do this (myself included), but I suppose if we
<br>
cared strongly enough about it, we'd make time, or collect enough money to
<br>
pay someone to do it.
<br>
<p>The schedule for the Senate Committee on C,S &amp; T indicates that there will
<br>
be a hearing on the cloning bill this coming Wednesday.
