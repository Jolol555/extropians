<p>Cool!
<br>
<p>Hey, just a thought here: is the extro-list suddenly getting
<br>
way more idea-ey than normal?  Ive been reading it for
<br>
almost 5 yrs now and the idea content and energy level
<br>
seems to have surged.  I myself am way more idea-ey
<br>
during the late winter, but I have always attributed that
<br>
to a bit of seasonal depression.  Perhaps others have a
<br>
little of that too, and the result is seen with the large
<br>
numbers of posters involved?  I wonder if there is a
<br>
way to measure the idea content of the extropian list.
<br>
If we could somehow assign an objective number to
<br>
the brain level each day I could use some of those
<br>
cool digital filtering tools available in matlab, do a
<br>
Butterworth filter or something, see if our thinking
<br>
really does get more profound in February and March.
<br>
If nothing else, we could use the number of posts
<br>
per day.  A first refinement might be the number of
<br>
posts minus the jokes and gun posts?  Or the amount
<br>
of new material?  Or the number of kbytes minus
<br>
the quoted material?
