<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
C-Reactive protein reduced to low levels by three statin drugs
<br>
<p>A study reported in the April 17, 2001 issue of Circulation:  Journal of
<br>
the American Heart Association showed that three major statin drugs:
<br>
pravastain, simvastatin and atorvastain can all reduce blood levels of
<br>
C-reactive protein.  C-reactive protein. or CRP, is a protein whose
<br>
elevation is linked with inflammatory states associated with stroke and
<br>
myocardial infarction.  The cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin had
<br>
previously been shown to reduce CRP.
<br>
<p>In a randomized double-blind study of individuals with high triglycerides
<br>
and high LDL cholesterol levels, participants were given the three drugs
<br>
alternately for six week periods.  Blood samples were taken at the
<br>
beginning of the study and after each six week period.   While taking
<br>
pravastain, C-reactive protein levels were reduced in nearly
<br>
three-quarters of the subjects and simvastain reduced CRP levels in 82%.
<br>
The average reduction in CRP was 28% for the atorvastatin period, 23% for
<br>
simvastatin and 20% while taking pravastain.
<br>
<p>Study author Ishwarlal Jialal, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Division of
<br>
Clinical Biochemistry and Human Metabolism at the University of Texas
<br>
Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas stated, &quot;This is the first study
<br>
where all three statin drugs were used in the same patients and their
<br>
results compared.  We found that 70 percent to 80 percent of patients who
<br>
took any of these statins lowered their CRP to below 2.0 milligrams per
<br>
liter, the critical level at which the risk of heart attack or stroke
<br>
increases dramatically.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr Jialal observed that present medical standards consider C-reactive
<br>
protein levels of less than 10 milligrams per liter as normal, but that &quot;
<br>
. . .  several studies have shown that, in order to achieve a very low
<br>
risk of cardiovascular disease, the CRP level must be below 0.7 mg/L. At
<br>
levels of just 2.0 mg/L or above, the risk doubles or triples using the
<br>
high sensitive assay which is now available in most academic medical
<br>
centers.  The good thing about all three statin drugs is that they lower
<br>
CRP at the same time that they lower LDL and triglycerides.  This is
<br>
probably why they are associated with lower mortality from heart attacks
<br>
and strokes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr Jialal also noted that the study showed for the first time a
<br>
significant correlation between the reduction of C-reactive protein and
<br>
levels of triglycerides.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
<p>Vitamin C low in head trauma and intracerebral hemorrhage
<br>
<p>Animal studies have shown that the damage that occurs with stroke or head
<br>
injury is in large part caused by the production of reactive oxygen
<br>
species and excess free radicals, unstable molecules that react with other
<br>
molecules and damage tissue. Hemorrhage causes the release of heme-iron,
<br>
which participates in free radical reactions that product reactive oxygen
<br>
species. These peroxidize lipids, such as those found in the brain. This
<br>
peroxidation may change the permeability and fluidity of brain cell
<br>
membranes, which can damage cellular function.
<br>
<p>In the present study, which sought to examine the formation of reactive
<br>
oxygen species in humans by measuring antioxidant depletion, six female
<br>
and seven male head trauma patients, and one woman and fourteen men with
<br>
intracerebral hemorrhage were enrolled in the study within twenty-four
<br>
hours of the onset of their injury. The patients as well as forty controls
<br>
were examined via CT scan of the brain to determine the extent of injury
<br>
and had blood samples drawn. Plasma concentrations of vitamin C, vitamin
<br>
E, coenzyme Q10 and uric acid were determined by lab analysis. All of the
<br>
patients with brain injuries had significantly lower vitamin C levels
<br>
compared to the controls. Vitamin C levels in the head trauma and
<br>
intracerebral hemorrhage patients were inversely correlated with the
<br>
diameter of the injury. No correlations were observed between antioxidant
<br>
levels and smoking status, hypertension, calorie intake, diabetes, serum
<br>
cholesterol and other factors.
<br>
<p>The authors write that, consistent with animal findings, the study
<br>
provides evidence of oxidative stress induced antioxidant (specifically
<br>
vitamin C) depletion in head trauma and intracerebral hemorrhage. They
<br>
note that vitamin C forms the first line of antioxidant defense and
<br>
protects lipids from peroxidation, and that the effect of vitamin C
<br>
supplementation on these types of patients remains to be studied.

<p>Ginkgo and alpha-lipoic acid reduce stroke damage
<br>
<p>A study published in the April 2001 issue of the American Heart
<br>
Association journal Stroke reported the effects of two antioxidants,
<br>
ginkgo biloba and alpha-lipoic acid, given to mice in whom ischemic
<br>
strokes were experimentally induced. Ginkgo and lipoic acid are known to
<br>
be reduce the formation of free radicals, as well as inhibiting platelet
<br>
and white blood cell activation and adhesion, and improving cerebral blood
<br>
flow, all of which could be beneficial to someone suffering from a stroke.
<br>
Ginkgo and lipoic acid have also been shown to protect the brain in models
<br>
of ischemia, the condition of lack of blood flow to an area that occurs
<br>
during stroke or heart attack.
<br>
<p>In a randomized trial of ginkgo, sixty mice received either a low oral
<br>
dose of 50 mg per kilogram body weight, a high dose of 100 mg per kilogram
<br>
body weight, or a placebo for a period of seven days. On the seventh day
<br>
of the study, strokes were induced in the mice, followed by return of
<br>
blood flow forty-five minutes later. After twenty-four hours the mice were
<br>
evaluated and the volume of the infarct, or damaged area, was determined.
<br>
In the study utilizing lipoic acid, twenty-four mice were injected with
<br>
100 mg per kilogram lipoic acid, or a placebo one and a half hours before
<br>
stroke was induced.
<br>
<p>Mice receiving lipoic acid and the low dose of ginkgo had signifcantly
<br>
smaller infarcted areas than the mice that received the placebo. However,
<br>
10% of the mice receiving the high dose of ginkgo experienced areas of
<br>
intracerebral hemorrhage within the infarct and this group had on average
<br>
had infarct volumes comparable to the controls. The mice receiving lipoic
<br>
acid had higher neurologic scores in addition to smaller infarct volumes
<br>
compared to the placebo group.
<br>
<p>Ginkgo and alpha-lipoic acid may be helpful for humans at risk of
<br>
thrombotic stroke. Caution might be exercised when considering taking high
<br>
doses of ginkgo by someone at risk for hemorrhagic stroke.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Stroke (Ischemic, thrombotic, embolic)
<br>
<p>A revolutionary improvement has occurred in the treatment of ischemic
<br>
strokes, yet health care providers still do not treat stroke as
<br>
aggressively as they do heart attack. Many therapies that are proven to
<br>
work are not made available to the acute stroke patient presenting in the
<br>
emergency room. Development of computerized tomography (CT) and Doppler
<br>
ultrasonography has made radical changes in early diagnosis of ischemic
<br>
and hemorrhagic strokes. These advances have resulted in declines in
<br>
stroke mortality. In the 1980s, the development of MRI imaging further
<br>
improved evaluation of persons with cerebrovascular disease.  Then in the
<br>
1990s came conclusive evidence that specialized stroke centers for more
<br>
immediate and intensive treatment, combined with educating the public that
<br>
time to treatment decreases mortality and improves outcome for stroke,
<br>
further decreased the incidence of death associated with all types of
<br>
strokes. Oral anticoagulants and aspirin, as well as natural supplements,
<br>
are demonstrated to be very effective in diminishing the risk of a stroke.
<br>
<p>The FDA approved the use of a tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in June
<br>
1996 to treat strokes. t-PA had already been approved to dissolve clots
<br>
that occurred in the coronary arteries (acute heart attack), but the FDA
<br>
delayed approving t-PA to treat ischemic stroke for many years. Millions
<br>
of cases of death and permanent paralysis occurred because of the FDA's
<br>
delay in approving t-PA in treating stroke caused by abnormal blood
<br>
clotting in the brain's arteries. Physicians affiliated with the Life
<br>
Extension Foundation were using t-PA in emergency rooms to treat ischemic
<br>
stroke years before the FDA gave its official seal of approval.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Super Alpha-Lipoic Acid
<br>
<p>In recent years, scientists have found that a method of nerve cell death
<br>
in stroke and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and
<br>
Huntington's disease is excitotoxicity (excessive activation) of NMDA
<br>
receptors, and the subsequent generation of nitric oxide, free radical
<br>
induced lipid peroxidation, aberrantly increased calcium concentrations,
<br>
and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to depleted energy supplies.
<br>
<p>There is evidence that depletion of reduced glutathione makes neurons more
<br>
susceptible to excitotoxicity, and that intact mitochondrial function is
<br>
essential for neuronal resistance to excitotoxic attack. It is believed,
<br>
for example, that reduced levels of the energy currency of the cell (ATP)
<br>
that accompanies loss of mitochondrial function causes depolarization of
<br>
neuronal membrane, which exposes NMDA receptors to excessive levels of
<br>
glutamate. The resulting neurohormonal cascade leads, in many cases, to
<br>
the death of neurons in the brain, and central and peripheral nervous
<br>
systems.
<br>
Scientists have been trying to develop anti-excitotoxic therapies that are
<br>
NMDA receptor antagonists to counter this kind of neuronal cell death. A
<br>
recent study at the Dept. Of Neurology at the University of Rochester
<br>
Medical Center in Rochester, N.Y. demonstrated that alpha lipoic acid
<br>
protected against glutamate and malonic acid-induced lesions in the brains
<br>
of male Sprague-Dawley rats. They found a significant reduction of lesions
<br>
in animals receiving 10 mg/kg injections of either alpha lipoic acid or
<br>
DHLA.

<p>Super Ginkgo Capsules
<br>
<p>Studies have consistently shown ginkgo to be beneficial in treating a
<br>
variety of conditions. Ginkgo has a positive effect on circulation, both
<br>
cerebral and peripheral, including an ability to reduce abnormalities of
<br>
muscle tone, of blood vessels, capillary permeability, abnormal
<br>
aggregation of blood platelets, arterial damage caused by atherosclerosis
<br>
and tissue damage caused by low blood flow.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE MAY 2001 PREVIEW
<br>
The Silent Stroke Epidemic by William Faloon
<br>
<p>Of all the diseases that affect aging humans, stroke is the most feared.
<br>
Most people believe a stroke can either kill suddenly or induce a state of
<br>
paralysis requiring institutional care.
<br>
<p>A surprising new study reveals that most strokes cause no obvious
<br>
symptoms, although over time these &quot;silent&quot; strokes lead to memory loss,
<br>
neurologic disorders and more strokes. According to this new study, eleven
<br>
million Americans have these &quot;silent&quot; strokes annually and by the time
<br>
people reach their 70's, one in three suffers a silent stroke every year.
<br>
This dismal report describing the &quot;silent&quot; stroke epidemic was presented
<br>
at a meeting of the American Stroke Association held February 14-16, 2001.
<br>
The good news is that other presentations made at this same meeting show
<br>
that the program Life Extension members follow to stay healthy may
<br>
dramatically reduce their risk of ever having a stroke.
<br>
<p>For the last 50 years, doctors have concentrated on controlling blood
<br>
pressure as the primary method of preventing stroke. While guarding
<br>
against even borderline hypertension is critical in reducing stroke risk,
<br>
there are factors that can be tested in the blood to further determine
<br>
stroke risk. Everyone over age 40 should have their blood tested to make
<br>
sure their homocysteine, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol,
<br>
etc. are in the safe range. High levels of C-reactive protein indicate a
<br>
potentially destructive inflammatory autoimmune condition that could
<br>
predispose a person to a host of degenerative diseases. C-reactive protein
<br>
can be suppressed by ibuprofen, aspirin or vitamin E.(12-15) Some of the
<br>
pro-inflammatory immune cytokines that cause elevated C-reactive protein
<br>
include interleukin-6, interleukin 1(b) and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
<br>
Supplements such as DHEA, vitamin K and nettle leaf extract can help
<br>
suppress these dangerous inflammatory cytokines that can cause C-reactive
<br>
protein elevation.
