<em>&gt; OK, analysing something like this is in itself an exercise in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silliness or too much seriousness. But I think it reveals something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the memes we have to struggle against, and I am a tired swede
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the moment :-). The core of the confused mail seems to be that 1)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a cyborg is not fun, 2) extropianism seeks to turn everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into cyborgs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt; 2 is based on the common view that any ideology has to prescribe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior for not just its adherents but everyone else too. While we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have views on universal principles, I don't think any currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing branch of transhumanism seriously proposes imposing itself on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-transhumanists (it would go very deeply against the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual autonomy and freedom that transhumanism tries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhance). It is basically the classical liberal view that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private morality for everyone; after we have settled on the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality needed to keep our societies working it should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended into the private moral sphere. But many people are so used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologies claiming the right to regulate everything and everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they have a hard time recognising just how tolerant transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure if that's exactly what the person was at.  She or he wrote,
<br>
&quot;don't give the chance to
<br>
other people, who don't know what to do with their lives...&quot;  I don't think
<br>
she or he was implying Extropians, transhumanists, etc. would force other
<br>
people to become cyborgs or what have you.  Instead, I think she or he was
<br>
bringing up the point of enabling other people to do something that might
<br>
not be wise in the long run.  You know, like handing a loaded gun to someone
<br>
who's feeling suicidal.
<br>
<p>I think anything we do enables something bad.  There are always unintended
<br>
consequences.  It's not a matter of choosing a risk free course, but merely
<br>
the best course we can given our limits.  There are certain easy situations,
<br>
such as the example I use above, but most are not like that.  And most
<br>
people, given enough freedom, can make good choices most of the time and the
<br>
costs of their bad choices can be limited [mostly to the bad decision maker]
<br>
in a free society.  So, it's self-correcting.  Plus, it allows people to
<br>
find out stuff they wouldn't under other systems.  (People often forget,
<br>
knowledge is not static, pre-existent arrangements of atoms of information.
<br>
It must be built.)  But this is just libertarianism 101 again.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
