<p>PPL isn't anti-political, but it is clearly a long-term political goal.

You could reasonable argue that focusing on long-term large political
<br>
changes distracts from shorter term smaller accomplishments.  But some focus
<br>
on longer-term larger changes, political and otherwise, is pretty central
<br>
to the whole idea of transhumanism.

<p>I'm not really an anarcho-capitalist anymore, nor a libertarian, but I
<br>
think this criticism is misplaced.  Anarcho-capitalism is consistent with
<br>
both social construction and a rule of law.  The question is *how* law
<br>
and society are to be constructed.  Acknowledging that democratic institutions
<br>
have utility is not the same as concluding that they are the best possible
<br>
form of government.
<br>
<p>I applaud attempts to think more fundamentally about alternative forms of
<br>
government, without assuming that some form of democracy must be the best
<br>
possible form.
