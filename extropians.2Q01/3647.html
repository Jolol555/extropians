None of this speaks to &quot;value.&quot; It also seems extraordinarily 
<br>
arbitrary. Why choose 'classification?'

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ayn Rand seemed to have a reasonable segmenting of the different levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought that may apply to this. She broke it down to 3 levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sensation: The experience of receiving input directly on a nerve cell, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the stimulus is gone, so is the perception. Bacteria and very simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critters rely on the direct stimulus and react method.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perception: The experience of taking multiple sensations and being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrate them into the understanding that there is a particular &quot;thing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one is observing (the cumulative input into your eye, from all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rod and cone cells turns out to be &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;car&quot;). Dogs and Cats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally live at this layer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conception:  The experience of taking perceptions and understanding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are similarities between certain entities that can be categorized and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classified. This is where we go from &quot;rock&quot; to &quot;a family of objects I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'rock', of which this is simply just one particular instance&quot;, or concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like love, bravery, etc.... Here's where us humans and AIs live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think many people would argue that baser animals exist on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception level (although a few tests have show that some chimps make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good play for it at times). Unless someone could prove that there is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of consciousness above the conceptual, then the AI will ALWAYS be on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same level as us, and only differ in scale and speed. Sure you can say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they MIGHT develop something new, but that's speculation and not based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If its this easy to draw lines about consciousness (except for the chimps),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sure an AI would have NO problem developing a system of classification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as such. It would be hard pressed to draw lines based on processing speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and memory though. Is the AI going to say to the less intelligent AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorry... you don't classify as intelligent just cause your running Pentium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3s and I'm using Pentium 4s? And I'm not going to try and sidestep dealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the issues by saying 'Well, I'm not an AI so I cant make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent predictions on what an AI might do', sure ya can. Remember,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception is the top of the food chain, unless someone has PROOF otherwise.
