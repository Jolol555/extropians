</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 0%.  Why?  Because the game show host *knows* the standard answer to this

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and only if* the prize is actually behind C.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On ExtroQuiz, if you pick door C, and the prize is behind door B, apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the gameshow host does not open door A and show that it is empty. What,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then, does the host do instead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing - just says &quot;Is that your final answer?&quot; in portentous tones, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no accompanying demonstration or additional information.  He doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *want* you to change your choice.
</em><br>
<p>...unless ve knows that contestants would know this, and thus take no
<br>
opening as a cue to switch (.5 chance vs. 0 chance of prize).  On
<br>
ExtroQuiz, the host knows that the contestants have done all the
<br>
second-guessing that matters, and thus know the host's algorithm (or
<br>
lack thereof).  Given that, how can the host act so as to minimize the
<br>
guest's chances of winning if:
<br>
a. the guest picks the prize door?
<br>
b. the guest picks a non-prize door?
