<p>
The truth is always too complex to express. We can discuss just facets of it.
<br>
Incredulity is fought with solid data, solid reasoning and dialogue with a pinch
<br>
of psychology to lead the correspondent into cooperation rather than a defensive
<br>
or an offensive. The correspondent's mind model has to be understood in order to
<br>
fix it. And even if he rationally accepts your thesis, he might still defy it
<br>
because of emotional stances (laziness, hubris, etc.)
<br>
<p>As far as psychology goes I'll give an example. If I boast my superiority, I
<br>
will repel all those who might be willing to cooperate with me. They know that
<br>
in the case of success, I will be the only one praised and known by the world.
<br>
But they too look for recognition and respect, and they might obtain more of it
<br>
by working on less important activities. A good leader gives up his own pride in
<br>
order to use pride as a motivational instrument for others.
<br>
<p>Regardless of whether thoughts about AI will be applied to an actual AI, there
<br>
is much substance in discussion about it, and this substance can be applied to
<br>
human thought. The knowledge in the AI community is often explained more clearly
<br>
than in psychology. An useful cognitive tool I have found is that of heuristics.
<br>
Heuristics are a way of quickly findind an approximate solution to a hard
<br>
problem. People use this all the time, which is perfectly fine, as long as they
<br>
don't try to &quot;solve&quot; an important and difficult problem this way.
<br>
<p>Sufficient knowledge is needed to take proper choices, in spite of intelligence.
<br>
Many intelligent people are so confident in their intelligence that they forget
<br>
about the inapplicability of their knowledge to a specific domain they're not
<br>
familiar with. It's important to estimate uncertainty apart from estimating the
<br>
most likely outcome.
<br>
<p>Academics often work with conflicting data, and their job is to converge to
<br>
truth. The disagreement is important because is induces all the parties to
<br>
understand, defend, and explain their positions well. The time it takes is less
<br>
important than the correctness of the final result. Besides, they have different
<br>
values, and values often cannot be discussed rationally, because their role is
<br>
similar to that of axioms.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
