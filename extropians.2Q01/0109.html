<p>
A friend at work lent me a book recently (I do this to
<br>
other people, so I try to bear it with good grace
<br>
when it happens to me :-&gt; ):  _The Multiplex Man_ by
<br>
James P. Hogan (1992), a reasonably entertaining SF
<br>
thriller whose McGuffin is a rather implausible
<br>
technology which permits the transfer of learned skills,
<br>
political beliefs, and even personal identity from one
<br>
human brain to another.  The book also wears its politics
<br>
on its sleeve -- it was clearly inspired by the collapse
<br>
of the Soviet empire, and in this imagined 21st century,
<br>
the former free-world countries now exist behind a
<br>
&quot;Green Curtain&quot; of oppressive state regulation of
<br>
technology and resources ostensibly motivated by
<br>
environmental concerns, while the former Soviet satellites
<br>
are now the epicenter of technological progress and free-
<br>
market economics, and the gateway to space exploration
<br>
and colonization.  While I find Hogan's descriptions of
<br>
government corruption, bureaucratic red tape, and police
<br>
harrassment in the U.S. all too plausible, the descriptions
<br>
of the revitalized East strike me as a libertarian fantasy:
<br>
[He] thrust across his passport, and having nothing else
<br>
to offer, his German visa and U.S. exit papers.  The
<br>
official pushed them back again.  'I don't need those.
<br>
You're in the Free World now.'  He stamped the passport
<br>
without giving it a second glance and handed it back.
<br>
'Welcome to the Federation of Eurasian Republics.'&quot;
<br>
Uh huh.
<br>
<p>However, I was very surprised and amused to find a page
<br>
of explanation by a neuroscientist character in the book
<br>
that is a very well-turned summary of Gerald Edelman's
<br>
1992 _Bright Air, Brilliant Fire_.  On p. 148:  [T]he way
<br>
the brain works can't be thought of in the same way as
<br>
computers -- which is what sent most mainstream research
<br>
up the wrong path for a number of years.  No two human
<br>
brains contain the same configuration of neural connections.
<br>
Therefore the same information isn't stored in the same
<br>
way, as it would be in different computers that are
<br>
designed the same way to handle the same data representations.
<br>
What happens is that genetic directions lay down a general
<br>
pattern that has certain commonalities in the embryonic
<br>
nervous systems, but the actual configuration that's
<br>
realized is a result of selection and reinforcement
<br>
between competing neural subnets as they develop, guided by
<br>
experiences and to a certain degree by chance.  Then,
<br>
later, after a unique connectivity is established at the
<br>
physical level, a secondary process of adaptive modification
<br>
is superposed on it, essentially in the form of selective
<br>
reinforcement of preferred pathways, based on the variable
<br>
sensitivity of synaptic receptors...  It means that the
<br>
computer model of the brain isn't really accurate...
<br>
Brains aren't wired to any pre-existing design that's
<br>
stored somehow in the chromosomes.  They develop through
<br>
a process of competition and selection among complex
<br>
neuronal groups, and they're all different.&quot;
<br>
<p>Edelman doesn't get any credit for this, at least not in
<br>
the paperback edition.  In fact Edelman isn't even mentioned
<br>
in the bibliography or index of Hogan's later (1997) non-
<br>
fiction _Mind Matters: Exploring the World of Artificial
<br>
Intelligence_.
<br>
<p>One other passage in _Multiplex Man_ that I liked (p. 174):
<br>
&quot;It's funny how people are always finding that the mind
<br>
works like their latest technology.  It never does, of
<br>
course, but it shows how they always think that the
<br>
latest technology must be the ultimate.  At one time the
<br>
brain was an elaborate telephone exchange of nerves going
<br>
in and out.  Then, after servomechanisms were developed,
<br>
it worked by feedback loops and error signals.  And then
<br>
after that, naturally, it had to be a computer.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cheers.
