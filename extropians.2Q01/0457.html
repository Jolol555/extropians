<p>Frankly I'm not too concerned. I think that there is a major conceptual
<br>
problem in the development of space travel: We are developing the most
<br>
advanced steps first. Rather than approaching it from a Conestoga to
<br>
Concorde leap, this is entirely the wrong paradigm. Air travel is only
<br>
the latest paradigm for getting from point A to point B on Earth. We
<br>
should be focusing on developing a railroad paradigm of space travel:
<br>
simple vehicles transported via large constantly usable infrastructure.
<br>
Going to an airline paradigm or automobile paradigm is much farther down
<br>
the road.
<br>
<p>So long as we try to leapfrog like this, we will be doomed to failure
<br>
for trying too much too soon. 
<br>
<p>The mass launcher concept needs revisiting, albiet with some add-ons
<br>
that help out the math:
<br>
<p>a) mag-lev with air vortex: You don't need a vacuum in the tube to
<br>
minimize air resistance, you need to get air speed in the tube up, like
<br>
a wind tunnel. Causing the tube to evacuate its air out the exit end via
<br>
a tornado-like vortex (the vortex prevents outside air from travelling
<br>
back down the tube), reciprocated by air-pressure (possibly boosted by
<br>
controlled/injected combustion and/or laser propulsion) behind the
<br>
projectile would assist the mag-lev launching.
<br>
<p>b) laser propulsion 2nd stage: ground based lasers at the mountain peak
<br>
where the tube exit is would continue boosting the projectile after
<br>
leaving the tube, up to a downrange/altitude of 30-100 km and 13,000
<br>
kph.
<br>
<p>c) scramjet/rocket chem or nuke insertion stage into orbit.
<br>
<p>What is the mass fraction a vehicle would need if it was already
<br>
travelling 1000 mph at 15,000 on a 30 degree trajectory, from the
<br>
equator?
