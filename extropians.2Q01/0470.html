Subject: Cyprus gives thumbs-down to cloning science on island
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NICOSIA, March 12 (AFP) - The Cypriot government said Monday it  
<br>
was not about to permit anyone to start human cloning experiments on 
<br>
the island after an Italian scientist targetted Cyprus as a possible 
<br>
breeding ground. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italian doctor Severino Antinori - who helped a 62-year-old  
<br>
woman get pregnant in 1993 - said he would clone humans in Cyprus or 
<br>
the former Soviet Union if the Israeli government thwarted his plans 
<br>
to work there. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His aim to open a cloning laboratory in Israel was strongly  
<br>
condemned by the Jewish state on Sunday following reports of the 
<br>
doctor's ambitions in the German newsweekly Der Spiegel. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obstetrician, who has boasted he could clone a human being  
<br>
within two years, said in a statement Monday &quot;there were countries 
<br>
like Cyprus where (cloning) could be done.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comment was met with a stern reaction by government  
<br>
spokesman Michalis Papapetrou who told AFP: &quot;We wouldn't allow such 
<br>
a thing.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are against such things as the government has signed an  
<br>
international treaty against cloning,&quot; he added. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Cyprus has signed a Council of Europe protocol which bans  
<br>
human cloning, the country does not yet have legislation in place 
<br>
governing genetics. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, Antinori has not applied for a permit to work in Cyprus,  
<br>
said 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Papapetrou.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But last week, Cypriot-born Dr. Panayiotis Zavos -- a  
<br>
reproduction specialist and a close associate of the Italian -- 
<br>
visited Nicosia from his home in the United States to tell the 
<br>
government about his dream to open a cloning clinic for infertile 
<br>
couples who wish to have babies. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zavos met with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Health  
<br>
Minister Frixos Savvides last Tuesday and Wednesday and then went to 
<br>
a conference in Rome where he met with Antinori. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zavos' stop in Cyprus also coincided with a cabinet decision to  
<br>
appoint two bioethics committees to draft legislation on the issue 
<br>
of cloning. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Relevant internal legislation will be forwarded to parliament  
<br>
but this (cloning) would not be allowed to happen,&quot; an official 
<br>
source told AFP. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influential Cyprus Orthodox Church has condemned any  
<br>
attempts to develop the island as the world's major cloning centre. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
