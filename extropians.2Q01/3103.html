<em>&gt;James:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you have a thumbnail version of the techno-utopianism tradition  of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;left that you might want to share?
</em><br>
<p>The starting points for any political or normative philosophy is an idea of
<br>
The Good, and the things most likely to lead to the Good. I think most
<br>
liberal and social democratic thought shares with transhumanist
<br>
techno-utopianism the idea that the fullest expression of the capabilities
<br>
of human beings, including the richest experience of their own intellectual
<br>
powers, is a Good. Liberty, equality and solidarity are means to that end,
<br>
although each has also become an end in itself for one strand or another of
<br>
thought.
<br>
<p>The basic disagreement between libertarians, radical/social democrats and
<br>
folks in between is over what proportions or forms of liberty, equality,
<br>
solidarity and democratic representation are most likely to bring about the
<br>
full development of human potential. Libertarians put a lot of emphasis on
<br>
the ways that coercion, including democratic coercion, limits human
<br>
potential, but gives little attention to encuring that human potential is
<br>
raised for all rather than a few. In my view, social democrats achieve a
<br>
more intuitively correct balance of the relative importance of equality,
<br>
solidarity and a democratic state with liberty and market forces.
<br>
<p>For example, I believe that although the right to cloning and genetic
<br>
engineering should be recognized as a basic personal liberty, I think the
<br>
general good is best served by having an FDA that works to ensure that new
<br>
genetic technologies are safe and efficacious (as cloning currently is not),
<br>
and further that we should have a national health insurance system that
<br>
would allow all citizens to avail themselves of the fruits of these new
<br>
technologies, and thereby prevent the emergence of a genetic bourgeoisie.
<br>
<p>Also, I think that there is several practical reasons why leftists should
<br>
rediscover the techno-utopian side:
<br>
<p>A. A high-tech egalitarian society is a sexier organizing vision than a
<br>
pastoral, Luddite society
<br>
<p>B. Its far less depressing to see technology as a terrain of struggle for
<br>
democratic opportunities than as a monolithically corporate juggernaut whcih
<br>
we can only throw our bodies in front of
<br>
<p>C. The fullest expression of automation and intelligence enhancement will
<br>
make possible the egalitarian visions of Marx and other utopian socialists,
<br>
by eliminating necessary labor, and with it the &quot;relations of production&quot;
<br>
that gave rise to classes and oppression. Genetic and body control will also
<br>
blur and eliminate race and gender distinctions.
<br>
<p>Reasons why transhumanists need to open up to democratic thought include:
<br>
<p>A. Defending transhumanist technologies, and the right to use them, can only
<br>
be achieved by engaging in the political process, and not by diddling around
<br>
with anti-political abstractions like Privately Produced Law
<br>
<p>B. The chief driver of Luddite passions is fear of the unaccounatble rich,
<br>
powerful and corporations using technology to disempower people.  By laying
<br>
out realistic democratic paths for technologies - ways they can be
<br>
regulated, and their potential ill effects ameliorated - transhumanists can
<br>
reassure the public.
<br>
<p>C. Anarcho-capitalism is bad social science. All markets require social
<br>
construction, and the rule of law. Accepting that, one slowly has to
<br>
acknowledge the utility of democratic institutions, although dog knows they
<br>
can and should be made more efficient, far-sighted and accountable. Look at
<br>
&quot;capitalist&quot; Russia in the 1990s for an example of the efficiency of a
<br>
market without a functioning state, and Germany and Sweden for examples of
<br>
the productivity and social well-being that can be achieved by social
<br>
democratic market economies.
