<p>Researchers Find Evidence Of Aging System That May Promote Long Life
<br>
<p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Scientists have provided the first evidence of a 
<br>
hormone-based aging mechanism they suggest may promote long life in species 
<br>
ranging from roundworms to humans. The mechanism begins in the brain with a 
<br>
mutant gene that suppresses the release of hormones that prompt rapid aging.
<br>
“This is the first evidence of the way this aging mechanism works,” said 
<br>
lead investigator Marc Tatar, of Brown University. “It appears that aging is 
<br>
hormonally regulated, with a brain-based pathway that affects general 
<br>
hormones that come from a pituitary-like system.”
<br>
<p>The researchers studied a gene with function in the brain and other cells, 
<br>
called an insulin-like receptor (InR). The gene is analogous to those in 
<br>
species from top to bottom of the animal kingdom.
<br>
<p>Fly InR responds to a form of insulin. As a result, brain cells tell a 
<br>
thyroid- or pituitary-like system to release a second hormone called 
<br>
juvenile hormone. This compound circulates in the body, unleashing a chain 
<br>
of other events that trigger reproduction and rapid aging.
<br>
<p>The researchers bred fruit flies with mutant InR. They believed the mutation 
<br>
suppressed the release of juvenile hormone, arresting the aging process. 
<br>
Indeed, the breeding experiment produced dwarf females with life spans 
<br>
extended by up to 85 percent. Dwarf males also resulted, but they were 
<br>
generally frail and most died by 20 days. Males that survived to 20 days had 
<br>
low subsequent death rates.
<br>
<p>To test whether mutant InR had suppressed juvenile hormone, the researchers 
<br>
administered juvenile hormone to treat the long-lived flies. The treatment 
<br>
restored typical life expectancy to the insects.
<br>
<p>In the brain, an important aging function is taking place, which plays a 
<br>
powerful role in the rest of the body, the scientists said. Their study 
<br>
appears in the current issue of Science.
<br>
<p>“We concluded that juvenile hormone deficiency, which results from mutation 
<br>
in the insulin-like receptor pathway, is sufficient to extend lifespan,” 
<br>
said Tatar, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. “We 
<br>
think that in flies and worms, and probably in humans, insulin-like 
<br>
compounds mediate aging by either retarding growth or by activating specific 
<br>
endocrine tissue to release other hormones.”
<br>
<p>Scientists may guess which hormones may be involved in human aging, “but we 
<br>
don’t know which brain signals or external environmental signals turn on the 
<br>
aging mechanism,” he said. “This aging mechanism is something we don’t 
<br>
understand at all in humans. But we know something is going on. The 
<br>
neurocircuitry in our brains is similar to that of flies.”
<br>
<p>Aging is much easier to study in flies than in humans, Tatar said. As 
<br>
cold-blooded creatures, flies have a much greater range of adaptability to 
<br>
environmental signals such as light, temperature or food. These all may 
<br>
trigger reproduction and rapid aging.
<br>
<p>“Our brains function in a narrow range of physiological states and perhaps 
<br>
cannot adapt to signals that in cold-blooded organisms may prompt long-lived 
<br>
states,” he said. “Humans don't adapt to environments. We adapt environments 
<br>
to us.”
<br>
<p>The research serves as a model for further studies in other species such as 
<br>
mice, where scientists already breed all sorts of genetic possibilities, 
<br>
Tatar said. He and colleagues are currently studying how a fly brain makes 
<br>
insulin and how the insulin-signaling pathway regulates hormones that 
<br>
circulate throughout the body.
<br>
<p>“We’d also like to study how juvenile hormone regulates body aging,” Tatar 
<br>
said. “What does it do to tissues and cells, for example? Does it increase a 
<br>
fly’s resistance to stress or change a fly’s immune resistance?”
<br>
<p>Co-author Robert Garofalo, now of Pfizer Global Research and Development, 
<br>
originally isolated the mutant gene in fruit flies, while on the faculty of 
<br>
SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Garofalo had studied diabetes by looking into 
<br>
insulin receptor function. He and colleagues developed fruit flies with 
<br>
mutations in their insulin receptors. They found that this mutation limited 
<br>
the flies’ growth and rendered them infertile.

<br>
Brown undergraduate Diana Epstein; post-doctoral researcher Meng-Ping Tu, 
<br>
who conducted the research as a graduate student at the University of 
<br>
Massachusetts; and faculty member Chich-Ming Yin, University of 
<br>
Massachusetts.
<br>
<p>The research was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Aging and 
<br>
a New Scholar Award from the Ellison Medical Foundation.
