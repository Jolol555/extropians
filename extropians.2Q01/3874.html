</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun as experiencing it... not &quot;un-fun&quot; at all!
</em><br>
<p>Sounds just like Paul Durham's Theorie de la Poussiere
<br>
(Dust Theory) in Egan's _Permutation City_:
<br>
<p>&quot;Experiment two, trial number one.  Reverse order.
<br>
<p>Paul counted, 'One.  Two.  Three.'...  After an initial
<br>
leap into the future, he was now travelling backward
<br>
through real time.  It would have been a nice touch if
<br>
he'd been able to view an external event on the terminal --
<br>
some entropic cliche like a vase being smashed -- knowing
<br>
that it was **himself**, and not the scene, that was
<br>
being 'rewound' . . . but he knew that it couldn't be done
<br>
(quite apart from the fact that it would have ruined the
<br>
experiment, betraying the difference between subject
<br>
and control).  In real time, the first thing to be computed
<br>
would be his model-time-final brain state, complete with
<br>
memories of everything that 'had happened' in the
<br>
'preceding' ten seconds.  Those memories couldn't include
<br>
having seen a real broken vase assemble itself from
<br>
fragments, if the vase hadn't even been smashed yet. The
<br>
trick could have been done with a simulation, or a video
<br>
recording of the real thing -- but that wouldn't have been
<br>
the same.&quot;
<br>
<p>I wonder if this sort of reversibility Gedanken experiment
<br>
could be parlayed by a mathematician or philosopher into
<br>
evidence that consciousness **cannot**, in fact, be implemented
<br>
as a Turing machine.
