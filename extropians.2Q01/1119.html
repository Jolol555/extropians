<p>The Hangover Theory?
<br>
<p>by John Cochran
<br>
<p>[March 16, 2001]
<br>
<p>Many media pundits compare the business cycle to a party in which the host
<br>
(the central bank) takes away the punch bowl (raises interest rates) just as
<br>
the party (the boom) is really getting underway. The idea is that tight
<br>
money and credit policies trigger recessions. Ergo, loose or easy credit
<br>
policy is the way to prevent a recession.
<br>
<p>In contrast, the Austrian business cycle theory traces the cause of economic
<br>
recession (bust) back to the beginning of the party (the boom). The host is
<br>
guilty, not of taking away the punch bowl and spoiling the party, but of
<br>
spiking the punch and thus causing many of the partygoers to suffer from an
<br>
unanticipated hangover. The party is wilder from the start, but the next-day
<br>
consequences and cleanup are more severe than they need be. The downturn is
<br>
the ultimate consequence of malinvestment initiated by previously created
<br>
credit as the result of central bank policy.
<br>
<p>Such is the Austrian theory in its broadest possible outlines. But Paul
<br>
Krugman, perhaps the most famous media pundit/economist on earth, has long
<br>
denounced what he believes to be the Austrian theory. In his recent piece,
<br>
&quot;No, Virginia, recession need not be inevitable,&quot; published in The New York
<br>
Times, he criticizes what he labels a &quot;misguided economic doctrine,&quot; the
<br>
&quot;hangover theory&quot; of the business cycle. But what he labels a fallacy is a
<br>
fallacy only because he either does not understand the correct theory or
<br>
intentionally misrepresents it.
<br>
<p>Krugman is correct-a recession need not be inevitable-but he is correct for
<br>
the wrong reason. Krugman would avoid the hangover by attempting to keep the
<br>
party participants perpetually intoxicated. He advocates reinitiating
<br>
extensive credit creation by the central bank as a means to continuous
<br>
prosperity and growth. He correctly identifies the central bank as the
<br>
villain, but for the wrong reason-the contraction of credit at the crisis
<br>
phase of the cycle- rather than for the correct reason, the artifical
<br>
expansion of credit before and during the boom.
<br>
<p>Let us first examine the correct theory. The correct theory begins by
<br>
properly distinguishing between sustainable and unsustainable growth, as
<br>
done by Roger Garrison in Time and Money: The Macroeconomics of Capital
<br>
Structure (Routledge, 2001). Sustainable growth is growth consistent with
<br>
consumer/producer tastes and preferences and resource availability.
<br>
Investment is financed by credit made available from previous saving.
<br>
<p>Unsustainable growth occurs when the central banks's creation of credit
<br>
(often accompanied by crony capitalism) allows investment to exceed
<br>
available savings. The amount and type of investment and growth are not
<br>
consistent with preferences and resource availability. The process generates
<br>
significant malinvestment and the possible consumption of capital. The
<br>
downturn is inevitable because production has been misdirected by central
<br>
bank action.
<br>
<p>The onset of the crisis may or may not be accompanied by a higher market
<br>
rate of interest . It is more likely that the rate of interest and credit
<br>
availability will play a significant role. As the boom progresses,
<br>
entrepreneurs will need progressively larger increases in the supply of
<br>
money credit to continue the process of building the new structure of
<br>
production in the face of increasing relative demands for consumers' goods.
<br>
The increased demand for credit needed to maintain the new investment
<br>
proportions, the less liquid positions of banks, and/or a tighter monetary
<br>
policy by a central bank fearful of the effects of inflation should cause
<br>
the market rate of interest to increase. Investment cycles typically end in
<br>
a credit crunch, with a comparatively sudden and simultaneous financial
<br>
'crisis' for numerous firms.
<br>
<p>During the crisis and downturn, the results of previous excessive
<br>
speculation are corrected. One need only examine the business section of any
<br>
daily newspaper to find examples of this process currently at work. Both the
<br>
form and the quantity of investment change. Investment will be made in
<br>
shorter processes, in less durable goods, and in less labor-saving goods.
<br>
Demand for inputs in these &quot;shorter&quot; processes will intensify, but at the
<br>
same time, demands for inputs in longer, more durable, or more labor-saving
<br>
processes will decline. The net demand for inputs in investment industries
<br>
will decrease. Layoffs and idle capacity should develop in these industries.
<br>
<p>The Austrian model argues that downturn is the result of unhealthy or
<br>
unsustainable growth. Unsustainable growth is the consequence of money and
<br>
credit growth in excess of voluntary savings.
<br>
<p>The recession is the corrective phase of the cycle; market forces have begun
<br>
to reassert themselves. Once a crisis has begun, policymakers must walk a
<br>
fine line. If market processes are not interfered with by government
<br>
policies, the recession that follows the crisis will be sharp and short and
<br>
will eliminate and correct the past errors and malinvestments. In other
<br>
words, the economy moves on.
<br>
<p>If the government interferes with the market processes, however, the
<br>
adjustment may be postponed, but the recession eventually will be more
<br>
severe and, most likely, more prolonged. William Anderson (&quot;What Happened to
<br>
Japan&quot;) shows how such interference is currently affecting Japan. Vedder and
<br>
Gallaway in Out of Work, Murray Rothbard in America's Great Depression,  and
<br>
Benjamin M. Anderson in Economics and the Public Welfare provide ample
<br>
historical evidence with an emphasis on comparing the 1920-21 crisis, which
<br>
fits the recovery-without-interference model, and the Great Depression,
<br>
which was a crisis followed by significant interference in the pricing
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Krugman incorrectly suggests the economy &quot;move on,&quot; not by allowing the
<br>
appropriate liquidations, asset repricing, and asset and labor reallocation,
<br>
but by reinitiating the credit creation policies. But expansionary policies
<br>
in this phase of the cycle are counterproductive, as shown by Vedder and
<br>
Gallaway in the most recent issue of the Quarterly Journal of Austrian
<br>
Economics. The economy does not correct and move on; the day of necessary
<br>
correction and reallocation of resources are only postponed not prevented.
<br>
<p>As explained by Ludwig von Mises in Interventionism: An Economic Analysis
<br>
(p. 40):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;But the boom cannot continue indefinitely. There are two alternatives.
<br>
Either the banks continue the credit expansion without restriction and thus
<br>
cause constantly mounting price increases and an ever-growing orgy of
<br>
speculation, which, as in all other cases of unlimited inflation, ends in a
<br>
'crack-up boom' and in a collapse of the money and credit system. Or the
<br>
banks stop before this point is reached, voluntarily renounce further credit
<br>
expansion and thus bring about the crisis.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The downturn follows in either instance. Stable, full employment will only
<br>
be restored when the structure of production again becomes adjusted to the
<br>
plans of consumers, when sustainable growth is restored.
<br>
<p>What can be done in the current environment? In the short run, the Federal
<br>
Reserve must cease creating credit, but it must also avoid a secondary
<br>
deflation or decline in the money supply. Current policy has achieved
<br>
neither objective. Monetary base growth has been erratic. Monthly,
<br>
annualized growth rates have recently ranged from 50 percent in late 1999 to
<br>
a -30 percent in early 2000.
<br>
<p>Most recently the base grew at a 10.9-percent rate in January 2001 and a
<br>
6.3-percent rate in February, with a yearly growth from February 2000 to
<br>
February 2001 of 3 percent (all data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
<br>
Louis). During the same period, a broader measure of money, MZM or  money of
<br>
zero maturity, has had growth rates fluctuate from above 10 percent monthly
<br>
at an annual rate to rates close to 0 percent. With current monetary
<br>
institutions, both objectives could be best achieved by policy directed
<br>
toward a 0-percent increase in the monetary base. In the long run, the best
<br>
cure is prevention. Monetary reform based on Mises's concept of sound money
<br>
must be seriously considered and adopted.
<br>
<p>The time to prevent a crisis is during the boom. Extensive malinvestment
<br>
needs to be prevented. The way to avoid extensive malinvestment is to avoid
<br>
money and credit creation. Yes, Virginia recessions can be avoided. Don't
<br>
spike the punch!
