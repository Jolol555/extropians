Okay, I now have xlsim-gurus set up as a mail list on sourceforge for
<br>
project discussions. I also invite everyone interested in registering
<br>
with sourceforge as a developer to join the project.

<em>&gt; &gt; Zero. And the funny thing is, it might take one of Yudkovsky's Super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Intelligences to finally develop a working model, if the aren't busy doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its interesting to wonder if the problem with TNF is that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fell victim to Moore's Law?  The 19th and early part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20th centuries, the dreams were always &quot;bigger&quot; and &quot;larger&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (you only have to look at the Saturn C designs or some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Russian N-1 or UR-family rocket designs to see that).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But one of the consequences of the Apollo program was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; push for miniaturization that led to the development of the IC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which was the real foundation for Moore's Law.  Once we had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in place, our enchantment with &quot;bigger&quot; got replaced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with &quot;smaller&quot;.  Since smaller requires less material, its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently cheaper.  So you shift to pursue this exploration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the engineering phase space until it bottoms out, presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with full blown single-atom nanotechnology.  Once you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, exploring the phase space of &quot;bigger&quot; gets much cheaper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, one of the problems with TNF, was that the primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept was the Tokomak (or variants thereof).  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently a large scale device (and therefore expensive).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have had to keep scaling this back because the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and governments don't want to spend the money to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something this large.  It will be very interesting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see over the long term how small we will actually be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to make TNF reactors.  If you take some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ion driven inertial confinement approaches (I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berkeley is working on these for example), combined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with nanoscale ion accelerators (right up against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits of the laws of physics in terms of acceleration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over distance), I'll bet you can get TNF for a lot lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass/power ratio than the Tokomaks.  The problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Tokomak and the National Ignition Facility is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they require such a large amount of matter to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the energy densities to drive a fusion reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is worth noting that the NIF, since its using ~10 year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old concepts and the construction is proving quite problematic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will quite likely be obsolete by the time it is finished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diode laser technology is moving ahead at a very fast paceu
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the NIF is powered by flash lamps of all things...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet another sign of the singularity -- any &quot;big&quot; technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantiation you build is guaranteed to be obsolete by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time it is finally complete.
