<p>What Cancer Epidemic?
<br>
<p>By Ronald Bailey
<br>
<p>Ever since the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962, one of 
<br>
the staples of environmentalist dogma has been that industrial chemicals and 
<br>
pesticides are causing an epidemic of human cancers. &quot;What...is driving the 
<br>
modern cancer epidemic?&quot; asks environmental activist Samuel Epstein in the 
<br>
November 2001 issue of Tikkun. &quot;Study after study points to the role of 
<br>
runaway industrial technologies… producing a dizzying array of synthetic 
<br>
chemicals that have never been screened for human health effects.&quot; 
<br>
Worldwatch Institute founder Lester Brown concurs, noting, &quot;Every human 
<br>
being harbors in his or her body about 500 synthetic chemicals that were 
<br>
nonexistent before 1920.&quot;
<br>
<p>''Cancer is reaching epidemic proportions and we need to identify the links 
<br>
between the public health crisis and the environment,'' declared Priscilla 
<br>
Rosenwald of the Pennsylvania Women's Health and Environment Network during 
<br>
a breast cancer conference in 1997. Such claims are often accompanied by 
<br>
pleas for massively expensive regulations that would require removing even 
<br>
the smallest traces of synthetic chemicals from the environment.
<br>
<p>But are we in the midst of a rising cancer epidemic? No, according to 
<br>
Cancers Facts and Figures 2001, issued earlier this year by the American 
<br>
Cancer Society (ACS).
<br>
<p>&quot;Overall cancer incidence and death rates have continued to decrease in men 
<br>
and women since the early 1990s, and the decline in overall cancer mortality 
<br>
has been greater in recent years,&quot; concludes the ACS report. The National 
<br>
Cancer Institute (NCI) annual report for 2000 also found that &quot;the number of 
<br>
new cancer cases per 100,000 persons per year-for all cancers combined 
<br>
declined on average 0.8 percent per year between 1990 and 1997.&quot; In fact, 
<br>
the incidence of cancer has declined by 1.3 percent per year since 1992, 
<br>
according to the NCI.
<br>
<p>A lot of furor over cancer rates can be traced to the seemingly dramatic 
<br>
increases in breast and prostate cancer during the 1980s. &quot;The apparent 
<br>
increases in the incidence of breast and prostate cancer are mostly due to 
<br>
increased screening,&quot; according to Mary Beth Hill-Harmon, an epidemiologist 
<br>
with the American Cancer Society. In other words, doctors got better at 
<br>
detecting breast and prostate cancers earlier, so this artificially pumped 
<br>
up their numbers temporarily.
<br>
<p>For example, with the advent of the prostate specific antigen test (PSA 
<br>
test), prostate cancer rates increased an astonishing 17.5 percent year 
<br>
between 1988 and 1992. Since extensive PSA testing has uncovered a lot of 
<br>
early-stage cancers, the rate of incidence fell by 10.3 percent per year 
<br>
from 1992 through 1995, and has been flat since then.
<br>
<p>Similarly breast cancer incidence rates jumped from 1 percent increases per 
<br>
year between 1979 to 1982 to 4 percent increases per year between 1982 and 
<br>
1987 (they've been largely constant since 1987). Again, the apparent 
<br>
increases are a result of more vigorous mammography screening efforts.
<br>
<p>So in recent years, actual cases of cancer are declining. How many people 
<br>
die of the disease? In 2001, the ACS estimates that cancer will strike 
<br>
1,280,000 Americans and that it will kill 553,400 people. Cancer is second 
<br>
only to heart disease as a cause of death, accounting for 23.2 percent of 
<br>
all U.S. deaths in 1998. However, overall cancer death rates also declined 
<br>
by 0.6 percent per year between 1991 and 1995.
<br>
<p>Breast cancer death rates dropped 2.2 percent per year between 1990 and 
<br>
1997. Colon and rectal cancer death rates have been decreasing 1.8 percent 
<br>
per year since 1984. Lung cancer death rates dropped among men by 1.7 
<br>
percent per year between 1990 and 1997, and prostate cancer rates decreased 
<br>
by 4.4 percent annually between 1994 and 1997. The five-year survival rate 
<br>
for all cancers combined is now 60 percent. These improvements in cancer 
<br>
death rates are largely a result of earlier detection (when the disease is 
<br>
more easily treated) and the development of more effective therapies.
<br>
<p>No rising cancer epidemic then. But perhaps the declines in cancer rates are 
<br>
a result of regulatory efforts to rein in industrial chemicals? That's 
<br>
unlikely, since very few cancers are caused by synthetic chemicals in the 
<br>
first place. Sir Richard Doll, head of the Clinical Trial Service &amp; 
<br>
Epidemiological Studies Unit in Britain, estimates that only 1 to 5 percent 
<br>
of cancers can be attributed to pollution. The American Institute for Cancer 
<br>
Research also concluded, &quot;There is no convincing evidence that eating foods 
<br>
containing trace amounts of chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, 
<br>
herbicides and drugs used on farm animals changes cancer risk. Exposure to 
<br>
all manufactured chemicals in air, water, soil and food is believed to cause 
<br>
less than 1% of all cancers.&quot;
<br>
<p>So what does cause cancer? According to Doll, smoking tobacco causes about 
<br>
30 percent of cancer; diet--especially consumption of animal fat--is 
<br>
responsible for between 20 percent and 50 percent; infections are 
<br>
responsible for between 10 percent and 20 percent; and natural reproductive 
<br>
hormones account for 10 percent to 20 percent. A good portion of the 
<br>
decreases in both cancer incidence and death rates in the U.S. can be 
<br>
attributed to sharp declines in the number of smokers.
<br>
<p>That's all good news, of course, even if it does burst the bubbles of the 
<br>
Lester Browns of the world and undercuts their demands for the removal of 
<br>
trace amounts of synthetic chemicals from the environment.
<br>
<p>Here's some bad news: While there is no epidemic of cancer, further 
<br>
reductions in the cancer incidence rate in the U.S. depend upon getting 
<br>
people to improve their diets and to stop smoking. That's no easy task, for 
<br>
sure.
