<p>Of course I made a hidden assumption. If assumptions were recursive

macros you'd have to expand fully, posts would take a day to write,
<br>
and bore the majority of targets to tears. I'm a bit worried that
<br>
the sometimes highly compressed (depending on lots of hidden state
<br>
built up over course of many years) communication style the more 
<br>
seasoned participants here have come to adopt, make communication 
<br>
appear like a sequence of non-sequiturs, or, worse, as semantic
<br>
line noise to newcomers. If true, this would seem rather sucky.
<br>
So, natch, I forgot to expand. Your namespace seems
<br>
to have a different prefix, that's why you failed to expand it ;)

<p><em>&gt; I agree with your sketch of the hardware/software gap, but it is not

<em>&gt; clear to me that improvements in software must always be less than

<em>&gt; improvements in hardware until the fateful quantum leap. Right now it is

<p>I'm extrapolating the peristance of the trend from past history 
<br>
(the last four-five decades, only two-three more yet to go), 
<br>
and lack of awareness of the problem set. The field, still
<br>
being rather young, has settled into rather heavy dogma already. 
<br>
Holistic approaches are being actively deprecated, since breaking
<br>
abstraction's usability. Lunatic fringe approaches, some of them
<br>
extremely fruitful on the long run do not receive the attention
<br>
they deserve, because appearing sterile on the short run. I could
<br>
go on, but I think that part of the problem is for real.
<br>
<p>We do not have many datapoints as to amplitude of the growing
<br>
performance gap between the average case and the best case,
<br>
but current early precursors of reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs) 
<br>
seem to generate extremely compact, nonobvious solutions even
<br>
using current primitive evolutionary algorithms. The result is
<br>
a curiously stable negative and positive autofeedback coupled 
<br>
oscillators. The whole is rather opaque to analytical scrutiny
<br>
and sterile to human attempts of constructive modifications by
<br>
manual means. We can only use the results as building blocks for
<br>
hybrid architectures (which also require man-made glue that is
<br>
immune to noise and nondeterminism -- we haven't even managed
<br>
to do that much yet), and for ingridients for other evolutionary 
<br>
recipes.
<br>
<p>Interesting enough, a few days ago a news message on transhumantech
<br>
(by Brian, I think) heralded we're to expect essentially strongly 
<br>
CA-flavoured FPGA hardware (think 2d computronium implemented in
<br>
silicon photolitho) in about five years. Now while I would 
<br>
compensate for the Nippon bias (the usual pattern of good idea, 
<br>
lousy first implementation, early termination of project), the 
<br>
hardware constraints which lead to that architecture are for real, 
<br>
and eventually bound to resurface either in other product lines, or
<br>
become accessible when we'll get our desktop nanolitho printers
<br>
for circuit prototyping and small-scale production, which should
<br>
be in about 15-20 years. We should see a big resurface in innovation
<br>
in then, since vastly lowering the threshold, by making small scale
<br>
prototyping affordable to individuals, even hobbyists.
<br>
<p>Since it's trivial to extend current compilers to generate
<br>
code for above targets, and the runtime for many algorithms
<br>
suddenly soars by several orders of magnitude on the same
<br>
raw acrage of transistors, it effectively hides the remaining 
<br>
deficit, so there is no motivation to address it, unless the 
<br>
lunatic fringe manages to reach high-output result regime, 
<br>
causing everybody to drop whatever they've been using, and 
<br>
rush over there, babbling excitedly all along the way. In 
<br>
case this happens we won't of course see above explosive scenario.
<br>
<p>I see two major driving factors for the punctuated equilibrium
<br>
(the Jack-in-the-Box-Golem) script: the positive autofeedback of
<br>
the mutation function, and the hostile takeover of the computational
<br>
resources of the global network.
<br>
<p>The reconfigurable hardware is not the product of a coevolution,
<br>
so it reacts very brittle to use of the bitspray on existing designs
<br>
as attempt to improve it. So the early fitness function, which
<br>
hasn't learned to dance around the potholes of the substrate yet, 
<br>
will produce only good results on small blocks, essentially 
<br>
bruteforcing solutions by stepping through large areas of the 
<br>
hardware configuration space. If you sift through a lot of bits
<br>
with a slight bias, you'll sooner or later find a sufficiently
<br>
good solution.
<br>
<p>However, real-world mutation is anything but blind, and as soon
<br>
as someone has burned enough computational cycles evolving the
<br>
mutation function itself, it will suddenly start becoming much 
<br>
better. If you just do something stupid, as building this fitness
<br>
function into a dumb Net worm, and release it into the wild,
<br>
it will bring down the Net, because it will discover most of
<br>
the holes in the protocol layers, which are legion. That's a
<br>
rather radical global debugging session, and it will bring most
<br>
of the world's economy to its knees (this is no hyperbole,
<br>
since we're not talking about the current situation), until the 
<br>
Net will be sufficiently patched to become operable again. 
<br>
The worm will be sufficiently subdued to become stealthy 
<br>
(becoming a more adapted parasite, or even a symbiont), and 
<br>
with time can even be incorporated into the network protocols, 
<br>
becoming a lot like an immune system, coevolving with the 
<br>
informational ecology (worms, and viruses, oh my).
<br>
<p>This is a very favourable scenario, especially if it occurs
<br>
relatively early, because it highly hardens the network layer
<br>
against future perversion attempts by virtue of establishing
<br>
a baseline diversity and response adaptiveness.
<br>
<p>Things only become bleak when you use your mutation function
<br>
to (ominous music, lots of hardware boxes standing in a room
<br>
in a mountain castle, coolant mists wafting, enter Igor in 
<br>
a white lab coat) create a BRAIN! MUAHAHAH! I  can  make  a
<br>
Brain!!!
<br>
<p>I don't know how hard it is to create a nucleus, and at which
<br>
stage it is still safe to escape into the Net (a chimp would
<br>
do a lot more damage than a rodent), but I would strongly
<br>
suggest not to try the experiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; cheaper to throw more hardware on slow algorithms and operating systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than to improve them, but that might not always hold. For example, if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume nanotech is delayed a bit we will run into a period where Moore's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law temporarily slacks off, and a big economic incentive to utilize the
</em><br>
<p>This is possible. It is hard to predict what will happen, but given
<br>
that embedded RAM designs -- not even FPGA-flavoured architectures
<br>
haven't begun cropping up in the roadmaps yet, and that most programmers
<br>
don't get parallel programming (who here has heard of active messages?
<br>
hands up), it seems that people will build fat CPUs with slow
<br>
external RAM, than figure out how to get the last little bit of
<br>
performance from that by optimization, before turning to the 
<br>
alternatives, and realizing that they have to throw away essentially 
<br>
all the tools they've grown to love and depend on. Schadenfreude,
<br>
what a wonderful word.
<br>
<p>Given human inertia, this will take a long time. My crystal
<br>
ball is in service right now, but I do expect 2d molecular 
<br>
circuitry by then, soon ramping up to multilayer, and then 
<br>
going 3d molecular crystal in a more or less organic fashion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; hardware better appears. Similarly, once we have full nanotech it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to do any better other than go for more parallelization, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway requires quite a bit of paradigm shifting in programming.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I recommend any programmer who's interested to take a good look
<br>
at MPI (there's MPI1, and MPI2, the most recent standard). It's
<br>
going to stick around with us for a long time, and is already very
<br>
useful if you're into high-availability and high-performance 
<br>
clustering (a bunch of PCs running a *nix, connected by FastEthernet
<br>
or Myrinet, a rather expensive high-end networking standard). A core 
<br>
subset of MPI should scale to very large relatively fine-grained 
<br>
systems of medium future and to their emulations in molecular 
<br>
circuitry. Check out &quot;Parallel Programming with MPI&quot; by Peter S. Pacheco
<br>
(Morgean Kaufmann publishers).
