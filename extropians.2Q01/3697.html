<p>This is a waaaay better idea, thanks Natasha!  If we had a system
<br>
which would allow the rater person to rate the *post* without
<br>
knowing who is the author, then this would be a better tool for
<br>
producing extropy.  To remain anonymous I would need to stop
<br>
adding these things  ----&gt; {8^D
<br>
<p>Many of us have a system where we have mentally done exactly
<br>
what we are talking about here: we have figured out the dozen
<br>
or two posters who consistently post something worth the time
<br>
to read.  When we return from vacation and have a jillion messages
<br>
we scan down looking for family, friends and those two dozen
<br>
posters, then delete the rest.  I do that.
<br>
<p>How would we do it so that we rate the posts and not the posters?
<br>
Then create a matrix such as was described previously?  Then
<br>
have the computer reconnect the post ratings with the person,
<br>
so as to make an ERA to allow Anders' filtered list of faves?
<br>
We could eventually write a subroutine that would keep track
<br>
of our favorite and most extropic posters and threads.   We
<br>
would tell the machine we have half an hour to read email, for
<br>
instance, and it would automatically delete the junk and give
<br>
you half an hour's worth of stuff from your family, friends and
<br>
favorite extropians, who got that way from writing cool stuff,
<br>
not just from being nice people offlist.  spike
