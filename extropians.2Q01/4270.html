Oops. Yes I did. Doh. Mea culpa.

<p>Since I get an opportunity to complete my previous message,
<br>
note that Solomonoff's principle is an abstraction of actual learning
<br>
processes, that purposefully neglects the cost of finding what is
<br>
&quot;the simplest&quot;. More effective induction models would take learning costs
<br>
into account. Also, in a more concrete model, asymptotic context-irrelevance
<br>
is not very interesting, unless it can be replaced by quantitative
<br>
non-asymptotic results. Reversible complexity measures (using reversible
<br>
algorithms rather than arbitrary ones) can provide better approximations
<br>
that take resource usage into account. When context is important, TAI
<br>
scientists have also developed notions of mutual complexity, common
<br>
knowledge, etc., to compare the informational content of contexts
<br>
relative to some common root. Anyway, what I mean to say is that it's a
<br>
fun field of science to explore, in which there are elegant mathematical
<br>
results that often prove useful to computer scientists or logicians,
<br>
that brings cybernetical insight, and has applications in computer learning.
<br>
<p>Darn. When TUNES is reasonably working, I guess I ought to do more of TAI.
