I don't want to change the subject line because it will not get sorted
<br>
properly in the threads, but it should start with &quot;CORRECTION: &quot;
<br>
<p>Also you are getting copies of this directly rather than via the
<br>
list since the List's mailbox is full and currently bouncing my
<br>
messages.  The Good Ship Extropy sinks under its own weight I'm afraid.

<p>SORRY mea culpa!  It should say 1 month @ 10^15 ops to simulate 10^-9 sec
<br>
of real brain time (e.g. 1 ns).  Lord leave out two little letters and
<br>
you land on Pluto instead of on Mars... What is the name of the company
<br>
that hires people like me...  Lockheed????
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1000 exaflops for a human brain?!  1e21 ops/sec?
</em><br>
No, 10^30 ops/sec.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where does she get that figure from?
</em><br>
Lord only knows, I'm going to do some more research on it and do
<br>
some calcs based on current MD simulations where the information
<br>
is published.   [My previous crack at this suggested you couldn't
<br>
simulate even a single human brain on a MBrain so there are some
<br>
*really* wide ranges in these numbers...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or is it a calculation for simulating the diffusion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual neurotransmitters on a particle-based level?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  It &quot;might&quot; be for a very fine grained NMR real
<br>
time monitoring of some type (since that is about the stage NIH
<br>
is thinking at currently).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hm?  According to _Nanosystems_, a rod logic runs at 1e21 ops/sec - one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; month of petaflops, or just about.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, as corrected you don't fit 10^30 into 10^21...
<br>
<p>Again, Sorry...
<br>
<p>Robert
