<em>&gt; When energy prices began to rise a year or so ago , almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similtaneously with the bursting of the tech bubble I began to pose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; query.... Could a severe increase of energy costs be a deliberate ploy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drive the masses to use electronic devices in favor of physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transport and transaction modalities.
</em><br>
<p>This assumes the existence of a mastermind that can effectively
<br>
implement such policies.  All the evidence I've seen argues against
<br>
such a mastermind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Accompanying this would be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation of a cash pool to stabilize the loss of investor liquidity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying the market weakness.  This same pool of cash could then drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the investor base which would buy into the companies which would merge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with or otherwise acquire the &quot;value corrected&quot; internet businesses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The resulting world scale internet commerce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enabled conglomerates would drive business to their door by offering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net integration to compete with more energy consuming and thus cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ineffective conventional cohorts??
</em><br>
<p>These things do not require a master planner.  The cash pool for the
<br>
first was already there, accelerated by the dotcom financial fad.  The
<br>
second was a logical choice for VCs seeking to salvage the money from
<br>
the first.  The third is by nature of the Internet...though having
<br>
worked in ecommerce myself, I can definitely say that it's not *that*
<br>
hard to run a solid ecommerce outfit, if you let engineering and not
<br>
marketing drive key decisions (though I may be biased given the
<br>
business awareness, especially ability to consider the other side's
<br>
concerns, of engineers and of marketers that I've seen).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know that if I was a global scale strategic planner who wanted to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the internet sucessful I would want to create this scenario.  Global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planners want to find a way to access and analyse every human action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bill gates/Microsoft has created the platform for this &quot;world domination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enabling knowledge pool&quot; by offering to supply the master data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warehouse/repository system.
</em><br>
<p>Except for the large percent of 'Net services that don't use Microsoft
<br>
for any mission-critical software (Web servers and CGI scripts, as
<br>
opposed to PowerPoint presentations - and it is the Web servers et al
<br>
that would record customer actions), citing the crappy quality of their
<br>
software, even if they do serve customers who use Microsoft.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The good side is that the ineffiencies of  the chaos that results from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unmonitored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human actions in every area of life from medicine to business to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education might be elimenated or at least extremely reduced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we are moving towards is  a borg-like electronic infrastructure.
</em><br>
<p>This, I will agree with.  Except that there is no single unifying
<br>
consciousness.  A better analogy would be a dreamer - or, better, a
<br>
disembodied brain, incapable of physical action - with multiple
<br>
personalities, where each of the personalities is flying around inside
<br>
the mind doing its own thing at the same time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I personally think that the computational complexity which comprises the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living program called a living human being will be recognized by any AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in short order to be useful and worthy of preservation.  Wishful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking?
</em><br>
<p>Humans don't necessarily recognize similarly-complex beings (like other
<br>
humans) as worth preservation.  Better to uplift ourselves into SysOps
<br>
(or whatever), IMO.
