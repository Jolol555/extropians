<p>A first language should in my opinion be something that is fun, that has
<br>
powerful enough constructs to create stuff that is interesting and that
<br>
you can learn with as long as you wish.  It should be clean and robust
<br>
so you aren't fighting with a lot of arcane BS and should be interpreted
<br>
so you get immediate feedback.
<br>
<p>I would strongly recommend learning Ruby.  It is relatively little known
<br>
in the States yet but it has taken Japan by storm including many Perl
<br>
and Python enthusiasts.  It is clean, fully object oriented, includes
<br>
real reflection, is fully garbage collected and includes many constructs
<br>
useful in AI type applications.  Check it out including a free
<br>
mainstream online book on the subject at <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com">http://www.rubycentral.com</a>.  
<br>
<p>I used to recommend (back in the early 80s) that people start with
<br>
Smalltalk as a pure OO language with an excellent working environment
<br>
unrivaled in IDEs even today.  I would still recommend it or Ruby for
<br>
really learning OO for the first time.  I still think it is a really
<br>
fine candidate.  A well designed free Smalltalk can be obtained at
<br>
<a href="http://www.squeak.org">http://www.squeak.org</a>. 
<br>
<p>Program in something that lets your mind sing and opens your head to
<br>
your own brillance without bogging you down in language idiosyncrasies. 
<br>
Do you want to be expert in the vagaries of some language or do you want
<br>
to understand and partake of the art and joy of programming?
<br>
<p>enjoy,
<br>
