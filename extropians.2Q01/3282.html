</em><br>
<p>I think that I see the flaw here, but I had to write a little
<br>
story before I could, and so, even if it is redundant, I might
<br>
as well post the story since someone besides me may need it too:
<br>
<p>Okay, so we are standing in the lobby in the Restaurant at the
<br>
End of the World, and overhearing an interesting conversation
<br>
between a well-known great 20th century mathematician and Euclid.
<br>
I mean to say that with the help of some Tiplerian technology,
<br>
they've both been resurrected.
<br>
<p>In the middle of their discussion, a student rushes up to
<br>
the mathematician and says, &quot;I've discovered that Goldbach's
<br>
Conjecture is unprovable!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; says the mathematician.  &quot;That is impossible.
<br>
If you had, then you would have proved it true, because
<br>
you would have prevented any possibility of me exhibiting
<br>
an even number with the (easily verifiable) property that
<br>
it is not the sum of two primes.  Go away, charlatan!&quot;
<br>
<p>Euclid takes this all in, and is very impressed.  But
<br>
just then, another student rushes up to Euclid, thinking
<br>
to have some fun.  &quot;By the gods, Mr. Euclid, I can show
<br>
<p>that your parallel postulate can be neither proved nor
<br>
disproved from your first four axioms!&quot;
<br>
<p>Euclid starts talking almost without thinking:  &quot;That
<br>
is impossible.  Suppose that you had shown such a 
<br>
thing.  Then that would mean that for any point on
<br>
the (lower) line, the upper line couldn't possibly
<br>
cross there, and so you would have shown that the PP
<br>
is true---not undecidable!  Go away, charlatan!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But sir,&quot; retorts the student, &quot;I've shown that you
<br>
can take it (the PP) and not reach a contradiction,
<br>
or that you can leave it and not reach a contradiction.
<br>
Yes, in some models it's quite true, but in others,
<br>
actually false.&quot;
<br>
<p>Being a genius, Euclid somehow sees the point.  But the
<br>
first student was still listening in on all this, and
<br>
noting Euclid's ashen countenance, decides he can pull
<br>
the same thing on the 20th century mathematician:
<br>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; he says, &quot;you can have a model where every
<br>
even number is the sum of two primes&quot;, or, &quot;you can
<br>
have a model where some even number IS NOT the sum
<br>
of two primes&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;And what becomes of that number in the first model?&quot;, 
<br>
angrily roars the 20th century mathematician.  &quot;You see,
<br>
we are talking about THE SAME NUMBER, idiot!  A particular
<br>
integer is a REAL THING by the grace of GOD! (screaming)
<br>
SEVENTEEN IS PRIME NOT BECAUSE OF ANY STUPID AXIOMS BUT
<br>
BECAUSE IT **IS** PRIME!!!&quot;.  At this point, the 20th
<br>
century platonist mathematician becomes apoplectic and
<br>
has to be taken outside for some fresh air.
<br>
<p>Says Euclid to the Riemannian geometry student, &quot;So if
<br>
you are right, then a HalFinney point, i.e. a point that
<br>
is at a maximum &quot;distance&quot; from where a transversal cuts
<br>
two parallel lines, in your model---is that the right
<br>
word?---of course wouldn't have that property in a model
<br>
where parallel lines never meet.  Hmm. I guess that's
<br>
another indication that geometry is richer than
<br>
arithmetic,&quot; he says with a smile.
<br>
<p>So I'll guess from my little story that all models
<br>
of arithmetic that have enough axioms to support the
<br>
concept of &quot;even number&quot; either all have a the same
<br>
even number that isn't the sum of two primes, or all
<br>
have no such even number.
<br>
<p>We reify &quot;seventeen&quot; and give it a particular identity,
<br>
and rightfully so, because you can prove many things
<br>
about seventeen, whereas &quot;a point&quot; is an undefined
<br>
concept in geometry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, just as the falsity of the GC would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to imply that there must be a specific number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which ISN'T the sum of two primes,
</em><br>
<p>evidently in any model,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so the falsity of the PP would seem to imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there must be a specific distance to a point which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the farthest possible point of intersection.
</em><br>
<p>but only in some particular model, that &quot;distance&quot;
<br>
depending on which.
