<em>&gt; I think your &quot;heart&quot; is in the right place, but the effects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such efforts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be relatively minimal compared to putting the same amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards accelerating the Singularity. If you are Bill Gates, why spend $2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion dollars helping people in Africa (who are just going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cash infusion in 10 years), when you could use that money to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause a world-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving Singularity instead? An event that would end such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems forever?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is infinitely more bang-for-your-buck by going that way, and that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reason SIAI exists as a charity instead of some private corporation.
</em><br>
<p>A couple responses.
<br>
<p>First, putting money into education in the Third World will help the people
<br>
in these countries NOT to need another cash infusion in 10 years.  That's
<br>
the reason to give them education instead of material goods.  Although I'm
<br>
certainly in favor of giving food to the literally starving, medication to
<br>
the ill, etc.  If a group of extropians were to take up charitable pursuits,
<br>
education would be the natural direction to go in, because it jibes with so
<br>
many of our other interests.
<br>
<p>Second, stating that the Singularity will end such problems forever, with
<br>
such certainty, is sort of silly in my view.  We really don't know how long
<br>
a Singularity will take to come about, or what its actual effects will be.
<br>
Maybe it will take 30 years to create the Singularity, in which case a hell
<br>
of a lot of good can be done by educating the poor now.  Maybe the
<br>
Singularity will result in a superintelligent computer that is fairly
<br>
indifferent to human problems, in which case it won't help the vast majority
<br>
of humans because it's spending all its time, say, solving math problems or
<br>
helping creatures in alternate universes.
<br>
<p>I am spending almost all my time and effort working toward the Singularity,
<br>
myself.  However, as much as I possibly can, I'm also trying to help the
<br>
less fortunate, along the way.  I don't do as much of this as I would like
<br>
to.  At least I'm pleased to have, during the life of Webmind Inc., employed
<br>
a large number of people in third-world countries and paid them salaries
<br>
that were generous by local standards.  Because of Webmind Inc., a bunch
<br>
people in Brazil and a few in Eastern Europe are better off financially, and
<br>
also have a deep sense for AI and the future of technology...
<br>
<p><p>-- ben
<br>
<p>p.s.
<br>
Bill Gates is spending his money on neither helping the poor NOR on urging
<br>
along the Singularity.
