<br>
<p>Open Source Sex
<br>
Annalee Newitz,
<br>
Salon May 31, 2000
<br>
<p>At a recent San Francisco sex
<br>
party, I found myself kneeling
<br>
rather rapturously at the feet
<br>
of three charming naked men
<br>
whose level of arousal seemed
<br>
unimpaired when our conversation
<br>
suddenly shifted from
<br>
pornographic fantasies to the
<br>
implementation of the Web server
<br>
program Apache on offshore
<br>
computers. While people began to
<br>
have (safe) sex on the mattress
<br>
next to us, and I continued to
<br>
caress my companions with a
<br>
lascivious wink, I found myself
<br>
in the surreal position of
<br>
discussing the nature of social
<br>
freedom in the software industry
<br>
while wearing sexy lingerie. I
<br>
don't mean to imply that the
<br>
conversation about code itself
<br>
was somehow erotic for us, but
<br>
rather that our sexually
<br>
liberated environment seemed as
<br>
good a place as any to chat
<br>
about something else we all had
<br>
in common -- our love for free
<br>
software.
<br>
<p>Free software is software in
<br>
which the underlying source code
<br>
to a program is made freely
<br>
available to the general
<br>
public. It's a development
<br>
methodology that sharply
<br>
contradicts the way companies
<br>
like Microsoft or Oracle do
<br>
business. At first glance, the
<br>
idea that free love and free
<br>
software would come together as
<br>
smoothly as so many sex-party
<br>
comminglers might seem odd, but
<br>
the scene really wasn't that
<br>
unusual. As my own regular
<br>
participation in both the party
<br>
scene and the world of free
<br>
software frequently
<br>
demonstrated, free software
<br>
hackers aren't all that uncommon
<br>
in the &quot;sex&quot; community, a group
<br>
that includes people in open
<br>
relationships, queers, S/M or
<br>
kinky fetish fans, and anyone
<br>
else whose sexual proclivities
<br>
fall outside the mainstream.
<br>
<p>Coders suffer an unfortunate
<br>
reputation for living
<br>
disembodied, asexual lives; they
<br>
are maligned for being
<br>
passionate only about their
<br>
computers and often deemed
<br>
incapable of non-virtual
<br>
lust. But the stereotype doesn't
<br>
hold true -- the geeks I know
<br>
are getting some, and not
<br>
infrequently with utter
<br>
disregard for conventional
<br>
social mores.  Most
<br>
intriguingly, that subset of
<br>
geeks who are passionate about
<br>
free software may well be
<br>
leading the way: Some of the
<br>
same free software programmers
<br>
who eagerly experiment with new
<br>
methods for developing software
<br>
are also gleefully dallying with
<br>
alternative ways of developing
<br>
sexual relationships.
<br>
<p>The people at this particular
<br>
sex party -- a private, monthly
<br>
event that many of us attend
<br>
regularly -- were in search of
<br>
freedom, or at least a relief
<br>
from social convention. They saw
<br>
no need to constrain themselves
<br>
to a sexual status quo just
<br>
because the boring majority
<br>
doesn't know how to have
<br>
fun. Likewise, many advocates of
<br>
free and open-source software
<br>
describe themselves as
<br>
nonconformists, rebels or as
<br>
just generally more open-minded
<br>
than your average person. In
<br>
terms of software, that means
<br>
that they delight in engaging in
<br>
practices that challenge the
<br>
staid old proprietary capitalist
<br>
way of doing software business.
<br>
<p>The ideals that underlie free
<br>
and open-source software are
<br>
applicable to more than simply
<br>
coding and business -- they get
<br>
at the very nature of what
<br>
constitutes human
<br>
community. Free software is a
<br>
shared resource that nobody can
<br>
selfishly hoard; open-source
<br>
software is an alternative form
<br>
of production that involves
<br>
groups of people who work
<br>
together rather than in
<br>
competition with each other.
<br>
<p>When programmers see that
<br>
software production is
<br>
dramatically improved in a
<br>
shared, non-competitive, free
<br>
environment, wouldn't it be
<br>
natural for them to apply what
<br>
they've learned from coding to
<br>
what they practice in their
<br>
everyday lives -- including
<br>
their sex lives? And the logical
<br>
extension of free and
<br>
open-source software in the
<br>
realm of sex would certainly
<br>
include publicly shared sex at a
<br>
sex party, for instance,
<br>
alternative ways of building
<br>
relationships (such as queer
<br>
sexuality) and non-monogamy (or,
<br>
to put it another way,
<br>
non-proprietary sexual
<br>
affection).
<br>
<p>One need look no further than
<br>
Richard Stallman, the most
<br>
prominent advocate of free
<br>
software, to see how
<br>
technological and sexual
<br>
experimentation can
<br>
merge. Stallman has both awed
<br>
and frustrated the open-source
<br>
and free-software communities
<br>
with his incendiary opinions
<br>
about why developing free
<br>
software is not merely
<br>
pragmatic, but also morally
<br>
imperative. But his
<br>
intransigence isn't limited to
<br>
code.  &quot;I've been resistant to
<br>
the pressure to conform in any
<br>
circumstance,&quot; he says. And that
<br>
includes sexual conformity.
<br>
<p>Stallman says he has never had a
<br>
monogamous sexual relationship,
<br>
and he's also observed that
<br>
programmers tend to favor
<br>
polyamorous or non-monogamous
<br>
relationships more than people
<br>
in other jobs. &quot;It's about being
<br>
able to question conventional
<br>
wisdom,&quot; he asserts.
<br>
<p>He confesses with a smile that
<br>
he doesn't consider himself an
<br>
expert on sex, but he recognizes
<br>
that the unconventional choices
<br>
he has made as a software
<br>
engineer are analogous to the
<br>
choices he's made in his
<br>
romantic life as well. &quot;I
<br>
believe in love, but not
<br>
monogamy,&quot; he says plainly.
<br>
<p>Stallman's specific beliefs are
<br>
his own, but the nonconformist,
<br>
experimental nature that guides
<br>
his work is shared by a
<br>
not-insignificant portion of the
<br>
coder community.
<br>
<p>Stallman is often dismissed by
<br>
mainstream software developers
<br>
as an oddball who is not to be
<br>
taken seriously -- so it
<br>
wouldn't be surprising for
<br>
defenders of the sexual status
<br>
quo to do the same. But Stallman
<br>
isn't unique in his hacker
<br>
polyamority. Author and
<br>
programmer Eric Raymond is both
<br>
a leading evangelist of free
<br>
software and a expert on geek
<br>
anthropology whose credentials
<br>
are second to none. &quot;Hackerdom
<br>
easily tolerates a much wider
<br>
range of sexual and lifestyle
<br>
variation than the mainstream
<br>
culture,&quot; writes Raymond in &quot;The
<br>
New Hacker's Dictionary.&quot; &quot;It
<br>
includes a relatively large gay
<br>
and bisexual contingent.
<br>
Hackers are somewhat more likely
<br>
to ... practice open marriage,
<br>
or live in communes or group
<br>
homes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, no one's been
<br>
counting how many hackers
<br>
frequent sex parties or
<br>
calculating the percentage of
<br>
open-source contributors who
<br>
also enjoy open relationships,
<br>
but there does seem to be a
<br>
crossover.  &quot;This [alternative
<br>
lifestyle] group is a healthy
<br>
contingent of the hacker
<br>
culture, and has been even more
<br>
influential than its size would
<br>
suggest,&quot; says Raymond.
<br>
<p>At the very least, it's safe to
<br>
say that not only are many
<br>
open-minded open-source hackers
<br>
unafraid of the anything-goes
<br>
mentality of the experimental
<br>
sex community, but that they
<br>
also positively embrace it.
<br>
There's even a crop of online
<br>
open-source pornography,
<br>
memorialized in J. Stile's hoard
<br>
of erotic &quot;Linux slut&quot; images,
<br>
which you can find on his Webby
<br>
award-winning Stile Project. The
<br>
overlap between the languages of
<br>
programming and kink is a source
<br>
of humor on a bondage Web site
<br>
known to fans as the BSD BDSM
<br>
Site. As an advertisement for
<br>
the &quot;Cat5 o' Eight Tails&quot; reads,
<br>
&quot;Light and fast, perfect for the
<br>
home or office where
<br>
multitasking is vital. Eight
<br>
individual strands to transmit
<br>
your message interference-free.&quot;
<br>
<p>This entire free software/free
<br>
love scenario would seem to
<br>
challenge the conventional
<br>
wisdom that holds that there is
<br>
something lacking in geek
<br>
sexuality. According to
<br>
stereotype, geeks are celibate,
<br>
disinterested in pleasures of
<br>
&quot;the meat&quot; or too socially
<br>
awkward and unattractive to find
<br>
partners. And sexual pioneers
<br>
are supposed to be
<br>
gutter-dwelling crackpots or
<br>
beautiful porn stars. What
<br>
reason could they have for
<br>
mingling with bespectacled
<br>
programmers who gripe endlessly
<br>
about such problems as coding a
<br>
free Perl script that will work
<br>
flawlessly with a proprietary
<br>
Oracle database?
<br>
<p>Of course, most free-software
<br>
advocates will tell you that
<br>
conventional wisdom is no wisdom
<br>
at all. For some of the select
<br>
group of techies who have
<br>
devoted themselves to free
<br>
software and open-source
<br>
projects, free love and creative
<br>
sexuality are part and parcel of
<br>
their dedication to communities
<br>
that value openness, sharing and
<br>
collective pragmatism.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's no causal connection
<br>
between being into open-source
<br>
software and being sexually
<br>
adventurous. Let's dash the
<br>
implication that open source
<br>
causes bisexuality or anything
<br>
else,&quot; laughs Eli Silverman (not
<br>
his real name), a longtime
<br>
programmer who worked
<br>
extensively with the GNU Emacs
<br>
text editor at a Silicon Valley
<br>
company devoted to open-source
<br>
development. He is also a
<br>
self-described &quot;pervert&quot; whose
<br>
collection of gray-market
<br>
lesbian fisting videos is much
<br>
admired in the sex
<br>
community. Adds Ed, a queer
<br>
Apache developer working in San
<br>
Francisco: &quot;Just because you
<br>
know other freaks in open-source
<br>
doesn't mean that being into
<br>
open-source makes you a
<br>
pervert.&quot;
<br>
<p>And yet both admit that the
<br>
ideals that motivate a person to
<br>
get into open source or free
<br>
software might also motivate
<br>
them to be sexually
<br>
experimental. Open-source &quot;is
<br>
not the textbook solution,&quot; Ed
<br>
explains.  &quot;It's an alternative
<br>
mode of economic production, and
<br>
being queer or non-monogamous
<br>
are alternative modes of having
<br>
relationships.  Perhaps people
<br>
who can consider alternate modes
<br>
of production are willing to
<br>
consider other kinds of
<br>
alternatives.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another Apache developer who
<br>
preferred to remain anonymous
<br>
noted that while he isn't a part
<br>
of the sex community, he does
<br>
see how the mindsets of the two
<br>
overlap. &quot;I suppose the two
<br>
groups do share a common sense
<br>
of rebelliousness caused by
<br>
marginalization by society, a
<br>
marginalization due to
<br>
deliberate choices made by the
<br>
individuals involved.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even as the craze for free
<br>
software saturates the market,
<br>
spurring stock market public
<br>
offerings and inciting fear and
<br>
trembling in industry giants,
<br>
opting to go the free or
<br>
open-source route is still
<br>
difficult.  Although lately free
<br>
software hackers have been more
<br>
likely than not to get rewarded
<br>
for their labors with stock
<br>
options from aspiring Linux
<br>
companies, the usual result is
<br>
more intangible, like getting to
<br>
build communities or creating
<br>
better code just for the sheer
<br>
joy of it.  Therefore, it is no
<br>
surprise that mavericks and free
<br>
thinkers are the lifeblood of
<br>
open-source and free software
<br>
development. And thinking
<br>
outside the box is, of course,
<br>
exactly what is required of
<br>
anyone whose sexuality doesn't
<br>
fit into cultural norms.
<br>
<p>Yet the notoriously debate-prone
<br>
open source and free software
<br>
communities are as divided on
<br>
the question of sexuality as
<br>
they are on whether Debian or
<br>
Red Hat is the better
<br>
distribution of GNU/Linux.
<br>
While people like Raymond and Ed
<br>
see the communities as open to
<br>
alternative lifestyles, others
<br>
disagree.
<br>
<p>Deirdre Saoirse, a former
<br>
employee of Linuxcare and
<br>
founder of a Bay Area users
<br>
group for people who use the
<br>
Python scripting language, feels
<br>
strongly that people involved in
<br>
open source can be just as
<br>
conservative and closed-minded
<br>
as any other part of the
<br>
population.  &quot;Some of my female
<br>
and/or queer and/or
<br>
transgendered friends have felt
<br>
very out of place in the Linux
<br>
community,&quot; she says
<br>
emphatically.  &quot;I've seen a lot
<br>
of sexism and not a lot of
<br>
openness to alternative
<br>
lifestyles among the community
<br>
as a whole, even in the Bay
<br>
Area.&quot;
<br>
<p>Goolie, a programmer who works
<br>
on open-source community
<br>
development projects at a San
<br>
Francisco start-up, warns that
<br>
an ability to connect
<br>
open-source sensibilities and
<br>
open-mindedness about sex &quot;would
<br>
take a particular type of coder,
<br>
one who felt that open source
<br>
gets at some basic, fundamental
<br>
expression of humanity.&quot;
<br>
<p>Richard Stallman, of course, is
<br>
just this sort of person. Free
<br>
software is not a business model
<br>
for Stallman, nor is it a
<br>
technically superior method for
<br>
creating software. Stallman has
<br>
made his point of view very
<br>
clear -- he doesn't care if the
<br>
software he uses is actually
<br>
technically inferior; for him,
<br>
free software is a moral
<br>
imperative based on the
<br>
principle that people who share
<br>
code are ethically better
<br>
people. His commitment to an
<br>
unorthodox romantic life extends
<br>
even into the realm of family.
<br>
<p>He says he distrusts the idea of
<br>
traditional families and
<br>
criticizes the idea that having
<br>
children is necessarily a
<br>
positive contribution to an
<br>
already overpopulated
<br>
civilization. &quot;As a child, I
<br>
rebelled against parental
<br>
authority,&quot; he recollects. In
<br>
his view, traditional family
<br>
structures are predicated on the
<br>
opposite of freely-given
<br>
love. His point of view is
<br>
shared by many people in the
<br>
queer community, where &quot;family&quot;
<br>
often means long-term friends
<br>
rather than biological
<br>
relations, and having children
<br>
isn't regarded as the logical
<br>
outcome of marriage.
<br>
<p>Like many social renegades,
<br>
Stallman has had to create a
<br>
home life out of his work and
<br>
friendships. He remembers that
<br>
back in the 1970s he flirted
<br>
with the idea of joining a
<br>
commune devoted to creating
<br>
&quot;families&quot; who practiced
<br>
polyfidelity (committed, but
<br>
non-monogamous,
<br>
relationships). But he was
<br>
concerned that he wouldn't fit
<br>
into any of the families.
<br>
<p>Instead, he created his own
<br>
family of sorts with his Free
<br>
Software Foundation, a nonprofit
<br>
devoted to the sharing and
<br>
creation of free software
<br>
resources and
<br>
information. Rather than sharing
<br>
food and shelter with a
<br>
biological family, Stallman
<br>
shares his famous GNU software
<br>
with an international group of
<br>
like-minded individuals.
<br>
<p>When queer San Francisco network
<br>
consultant Richard R. Couture
<br>
created a Linux-based Internet
<br>
cafe known as CoffeeNet, one of
<br>
his wishes was &quot;to create the
<br>
kind of space where socializing
<br>
and sexuality and an interest in
<br>
computers could come together.&quot;
<br>
And yet Couture, who also
<br>
founded the Linux user group now
<br>
known as the Linux Mafia, mourns
<br>
the fact that Linux users seem
<br>
so, well, straight. &quot;People call
<br>
me a pervert jokingly in the
<br>
Linux cabal,&quot; he laughs. &quot;It's
<br>
because I'm openly homosexual
<br>
and I sometimes enjoy freaking
<br>
everybody out by commenting on
<br>
sex. I do it to shock
<br>
everybody. Sometimes, I just
<br>
can't keep my mouth shut.&quot;
<br>
<p>Couture's friend Rick Moen, also
<br>
a network consultant and member
<br>
of the Linux Mafia user group,
<br>
contends that the connection
<br>
between hacking and open
<br>
sexuality goes back to the
<br>
1970s. In a free zine called the
<br>
Node, published by San
<br>
Francisco's now-defunct Kerista
<br>
commune, he found a &quot;mix [of]
<br>
articles about computers and
<br>
technology with pieces on
<br>
polyamorous/community living and
<br>
all sorts of other oddities. I
<br>
read it whenever I could find
<br>
it,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>&quot;Geeks are introverts, we read a
<br>
lot of science fiction, and we
<br>
have bizarre socialization,&quot;
<br>
says Muffy Barkocy, a
<br>
non-monogamous bisexual working
<br>
with Apache and Perl at
<br>
Egreetings.com. She believes
<br>
that a geek's stereotypical lack
<br>
of socialization encourages a
<br>
more experimental sexual
<br>
life. &quot;Because of our lack of
<br>
socialization, we don't learn
<br>
about the monogamous
<br>
imperative. It just doesn't
<br>
occur to us.&quot;
<br>
<p>Barkocy's point about science
<br>
fiction bears
<br>
examination. Speculative
<br>
fantasizing has always been a
<br>
passion for geeks of any
<br>
kind. For some free-software
<br>
enthusiasts, there is a clear
<br>
link between the bold visions
<br>
common in science fiction and a
<br>
tendency toward experimentation
<br>
in both coding and sexual
<br>
practice. Lile Elam, a member of
<br>
Linux Chix, a women's Linux user
<br>
group, suggests that many
<br>
proto-free software geeks grew
<br>
up imagining a world where
<br>
societies weren't necessarily
<br>
driven by the profit motive --
<br>
or by compulsory heterosexual
<br>
monogamy. Elam adds that many
<br>
hackers are also pagans -- yet
<br>
another data point indicating an
<br>
openness to alternative ways of
<br>
living.
<br>
<p>Adds Stallman: &quot;A lot of
<br>
programmers are science fiction
<br>
fans, and there's a tendency in
<br>
science fiction fandom to accept
<br>
non-standard relationships.&quot;
<br>
Science fiction is a genre
<br>
sometimes known for its utopian
<br>
musings on what a more liberated
<br>
society than our own would look
<br>
like. And reading about alien or
<br>
unknown worlds can inspire fans
<br>
to go beyond the realm of
<br>
imagination and explore
<br>
alternative realities and social
<br>
arrangements in everyday life.
<br>
<p>Not all free software geeks are
<br>
science fiction fans, of course,
<br>
nor are all open-source software
<br>
developers likely to be ready to
<br>
strip down and join a three-way
<br>
at the drop of a Red Hat. But
<br>
that's not the point. Part of
<br>
the essence of the open-source
<br>
and free software communities,
<br>
ideally, is that they are open
<br>
to experimentation of all kinds,
<br>
both in terms of practical
<br>
engineering -- the compilation
<br>
of efficient code -- and social
<br>
engineering -- the construction
<br>
of new ways of being in the
<br>
world. And these new ways of
<br>
being are certainly not limited
<br>
to the sexual
<br>
variety. Open-source enthusiasts
<br>
are likely to see applications
<br>
for open-source strategies in a
<br>
vast number of arenas, including
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
alternatives to sexual norms.&quot;
