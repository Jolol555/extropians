<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't actually know ANY social scientists who believe Margaret Mead's work
<br>
on Samoan sexual customs was accurate.  And I know a LOT of social
<br>
scientists.  Even radical feminist commies who worship Margarat Mead now
<br>
accept that this work was largely wrong.
<br>
<p>Most social scientists don't 100% accept Derek Freeman's portrayal of Samoan
<br>
sexual life either -- although it's generally accepted as closer to the
<br>
truth than Margaret Mead's original account.
<br>
<p>Many social scientists believe Mead was an important anthropologist even
<br>
though some of her work was inaccurate.
<br>
<p>In contemporary anthropology courses, the &quot;classic&quot; anthropologists like
<br>
Mead, Colin Turnbull (&quot;The Forest People&quot;) and so forth are generally looked
<br>
down upon as having been pre-scientific, and given short shrift.  They come
<br>
up in the intro course but appear nowhere in advanced coursework.
<br>
<p>So I really do believe that, in this particular example at least, you're
<br>
attacking a straw man.
<br>
<p>Similarly, in modern psych courses, Freud and Jung are mentioned in Intro to
<br>
Psych and in Theory of Personality or a couple other courses, but they
<br>
rarely show up in advanced work -- it's all about experimental design, data
<br>
analysis, and so forth.  I taught some Jung in an advanced psych course once
<br>
and the students were flabbergasted that I had the guts to bring up such
<br>
unscientific stuff in a senior-year course (I just introduced his theory as
<br>
a metaphor for some dynamical systems theory based data analysis we were
<br>
doing).
<br>
<p>There certainly IS a lot of narrow-mindedness and foolish dogma in the
<br>
social sciences, I wouldn't deny that.  But it's not nearly as simplistic as
<br>
you're implying.  These are smart, well-informed people making much subtler
<br>
mistakes than you seem to realize.
<br>
<p>A very common mistake made in sociology nowadays, for example, is applying
<br>
statistical methods when there are too few data points for them to be
<br>
meaningful....  And somehow the outcome of the half-bogus statistical
<br>
analysis tends to reflect the political views of the scientist involved.
<br>
For instance, conservatives do half-bogus statistics to prove that gun
<br>
control increases violence.  Then liberals do half-bogus statistics to prove
<br>
the opposite.  Ultimately, a lot of qualitative analysis is needed to guide
<br>
the use of fancy statistics.  But a lot of contemporary social scientists
<br>
don't want to realize this, because qualitative analysis has a bad name
<br>
because of work like Mead's in the past.  Yet, what recent experience proves
<br>
is that fancy statistical work is not devoid of bias either, rather it's
<br>
strongly guided by it, in complex &amp; subtle ways.
<br>
<p>To me, your view of social scientists is similar to the view I used to have
<br>
that &quot;rich people are greedy, selfish bastards.&quot;  Well, now I know a lot of
<br>
rich people, though I'm far from rich myself.  Some of them are greedy,
<br>
selfish bastards.  A lot of them aren't.  And when the rich people I know DO
<br>
make what I view as selfish moral errors, biased by their wealth, they don't
<br>
do so nearly as crassly or stupidly as I had naively thought before.
