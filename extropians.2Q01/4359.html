<p>You can sub in &quot;illustrating previously unknown reasoning techniques&quot; for
<br>
&quot;gloating&quot; if you so prefer.  My point is that someone who answers &quot;I bet
<br>
you think it's 1/3, but it's actually 1/2&quot; is demonstrating deeper
<br>
knowledge than someone who answers &quot;1/3&quot;, just as someone who answers
<br>
&quot;1/3&quot; probably has more (declarative!) knowledge than someone who guesses
<br>
&quot;1/2&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, this has been enlightening indeed!  All my life I felt

</em><br>
<p>There are non-Bayesians?  I've never heard of any non-Bayesians or any
<br>
&quot;controversy&quot;.  Where I come from, &quot;Bayesian reasoning&quot; is practically a
<br>
synonym for &quot;normative rationality&quot;.
<br>
<p>Maybe you're right.  Maybe a *mathematician* answers 1/3 - the problem was
<br>
posed about mathematicians, after all.  And I bet that a statistician
<br>
answers 1/3 as well.  However, a sufficiently alert cognitive scientist
<br>
should answer 1/2.
<br>
<p>So now we have *four* possible answers:
<br>
<p>&quot;1/2.&quot; (naive human)
<br>
<p>&quot;1/3.&quot; (naive mathematician)
<br>
<p>&quot;You'd think it'd be 1/3, but it's actually 1/2.&quot; (bayesian)
<br>
<p>&quot;It's actually 1/2, but all but the most alert mathematicians would answer
<br>
1/3.&quot; (actual answer)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only one question remains:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Vorlon voice:) &quot;We are all Bayesian statisticians.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'zat so?  You mean I missed out on the controversy after all?
</em><br>
<p>No - I just mean that the human brain runs on folk bayesian reasoning
<br>
rather than folk mathematics.  No, scratch that, that's a lousy sentence. 
<br>
What I mean is that, in this instance at least, the Bayesian answer is
<br>
much closer to the way our brains work than the mathematical answer.
