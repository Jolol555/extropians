<p>(Aiiiiiii, yipes!)  What ... straight?  No chaser?  Before some of you more
<br>
sensitive types delve into Ayn and Art and Aesthetics and Dialectics, I
<br>
recommend some antidotes which I have found to be very effective in the
<br>
past - here, for example, is one such antidote in the form of a few Andy
<br>
Warhol quotes.  Even when used sparingly, the quotes below will offer
<br>
instant relief. (A little negative space here, a little contrast there ...
<br>
aaaahhhhhhhhh! ... don't you feel better already?)
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think my art has any lasting value.&quot;
<br>
&quot;If everybody's not a beauty, then nobody is.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I voted once, in the fifties. I don't remember which election. I pulled the
<br>
wrong lever because I was confused. I couldn't figure out how to work the
<br>
thing. There was no practice model outside.&quot;
<br>
&quot;If I'd gone ahead and died, I would be a cult figure now.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I don't know where the artificial stops and the real begins.&quot;
<br>
&quot;They're experimental films. I call them that because I don't know what I'm
<br>
doing.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Wasted space is any space that has art in it.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I never wanted to be a painter. I wanted to be a tap dancer.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Pop art is for everyone. I don't think art should be only for the select
<br>
few, I think it should be for the mass of American people, and they usually
<br>
accept art anyway.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I really like comic strips... Well, I like the colours and the balloons. I
<br>
think people should always talk with balloons over their heads.&quot;
<br>
&quot;If you look at something long enough, I've discovered, the meaning goes
<br>
away.&quot;
<br>
&quot;You'd be surprised how many people want to hang an electric chair on their
<br>
living-room wall. Specially if the background colour matches the drapes.&quot;
<br>
&quot;The less something has to say, the more perfect it is.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Intellectuals are a bore.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I read an article on me once that described my machine-method of
<br>
silk-screen copying and painting- 'What a bold and audacious solution, what
<br>
depths of the man are revealed in this solution!' What does that mean?&quot;
<br>
&quot;If I weren't me, I think I'd like to be Jackie Kennedy. She's a very
<br>
glamorous woman, and I'd really like to learn some of her judo techniques.&quot;
