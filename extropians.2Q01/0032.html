With all due respect to Greg, I think he failed to indicate the *really* 
<br>
interesting aspect of the Atlantic piece he cited.  Following the portion 
<br>
Greg quoted, an unremarkable litany of the rising alarm over privacy, the 
<br>
article continues:
<br>
<p>&quot;[S]omething very interesting is happening: the market for goods and services 
<br>
that protect privacy is surging. Entrepreneurs are realizing that privacy and 
<br>
technology are not fundamentally at odds—and that, in fact, expectations of 
<br>
privacy have in large measure always been created or broadened by the arrival 
<br>
of new technologies. People are coming to accept the notion that the 
<br>
protection of privacy is a pervasive and lasting concern in the computer 
<br>
age—and that, indeed, it may turn out to be the true enabler of the 
<br>
information economy.&quot;
<br>
<p>A long list of market-generated solutions to privacy follows that set-up.  
<br>
The author's point--that market players stand ready to serve the demand for 
<br>
privacy--merits celebration in its own right.  But that same observation may 
<br>
also have the legal effect of rendering new regulations unconstitution.  For 
<br>
that argument, see Tom W. Bell, &quot;Pornography, Privacy, and Digital Self-Help
<br>
,&quot; 19 John Marshall J. Comp. &amp; Info. L. __ (2000) (forthcoming; currently in 
<br>
draft) available at &lt;<a href="http://www.tomwbell.com/writings/PrivJCILAb.html">http://www.tomwbell.com/writings/PrivJCILAb.html</a>&gt;.

<em>&gt;Here's an interesting article from The Atlantic magazine (which seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hit all the bases but Brin's:

<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/03/lester.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/03/lester.htm</a>
</em><br>

<em>&gt;&quot;New surveillance and information-gathering technologies are everywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these days, and they're setting off all sorts of alarm bells for those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worry about the erosion of privacy. The result has been a clangor of dire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predictions. Books have recently appeared with such titles as Database 
</em><br>
Nation:
<br>
<em>&gt;The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century (by Simson Garfinkel), The Unwanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gaze: The Destruction of Privacy in America (by Jeffrey Rosen), and The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;End of Privacy: How Total Surveillance Is Becoming a Reality (by Reg 
</em><br>
Whitaker).
<br>
<em>&gt;Polls suggest that the public is gravely concerned: a 1999 Wall Street 
</em><br>
Journal-NBC
<br>
<em>&gt;survey, for instance, indicated that privacy is the issue that concerns
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans most about the twenty-first century, ahead of overpopulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;racial tensions, and global warming. Politicians can't talk enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;privacy, and are rushing to pass laws to protect it. Increasingly, business
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and technology are seen as the culprits. &quot;Over the next 50 years,&quot; the 
</em><br>
journalist
<br>
<em>&gt;Simson Garfinkel writes in Database Nation, &quot;we will see new kinds of threats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to privacy that don't find their roots in totalitarianism, but in capitalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the free market, advanced technology, and the unbridled exchange of 
</em><br>
electronic
<br>
<em>&gt;information.&quot;
