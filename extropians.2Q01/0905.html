</em><br>
<p>No, let us be very clear about this.  Simulated beings are quite
<br>
likely to require significantly greater resources than &quot;real&quot;
<br>
beings. They are therefore less efficient, and therefore place a
<br>
fundamental limit on the complexity (un-entropy) you can generate
<br>
if you have a requirement for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) continuing to run; or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) saving copies of
<br>
all self-conscious entities.
<br>
<p>Once you make the choice to value simulations (or history) at a
<br>
level equal to or greater than &quot;evolution&quot; you have inherently
<br>
limited your exploration of the possible phase space because
<br>
you disallow your option of wiping the slate &quot;clean&quot; to start over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Conscious knowledge isn't a message, it is the result of a message.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps we can say &quot;conscious knowledge&quot; is a short-term &quot;executing&quot;
<br>
neuronal pattern.  If I go to sleep tonight, I will wake up tomorrow
<br>
with &quot;mostly&quot; the same memories.  However my conscious thought pattern
<br>
may think that everything my conscious thought pattern tonight is
<br>
thinking was completely wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [snip] In order to know the true meaning of this binary number,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you must map it back to salty. [snip] It doesn't matter to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation.  But to us it does matter.
</em><br>
<p>But what you map it back to is entirely based on accumulated
<br>
memories.  You have salt receptors -- initially they send a
<br>
signal to the brain -- but that doesn't connect with anything
<br>
(except a low level genetic program that says &quot;salt is good
<br>
if your salt levels are low&quot;).  But eventually the &quot;salt&quot;
<br>
signal gets associated with a whole set of different experiences
<br>
(perhaps qualia from your perspective) that when we experience
<br>
salt in the future trigger a very large set of association driven
<br>
memories that will make our experience of &quot;salty&quot; tastes be
<br>
good or bad.
<br>
<p>Re: synsthesia
<br>
In this case you have &quot;cross-wiring&quot; -- the experiences
<br>
that are associated with &quot;red&quot; the red signal somehow get
<br>
associated with &quot;salt&quot; as well (or instead). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you want to eff with a simulation so that you can know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it's representation of salt is like, how could it be possible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to have anything to eff?
</em><br>
<p>This is an &quot;experience&quot; mapping problem.  &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;salt&quot; are
<br>
simple examples because we can easily generate those input
<br>
stimulants and monitor the associated brain activity.  Try a
<br>
word like &quot;love&quot; or &quot;security&quot;.  They are going to produce
<br>
*extraordinarily* different &quot;meanings&quot; in individual brains.
<br>
You either have to &quot;map&quot; one person's interpretation onto the
<br>
others (so &quot;salty&quot; becomes &quot;red&quot;) or else you have to let
<br>
people have full access to the experienced data stream
<br>
(with 1-for-1 mappings to the best degree possible).
<br>
I myself would find it fascinating to put salt on my tongue,
<br>
and be wired into the other person's perceptions such that
<br>
my memory of &quot;red&quot; gets stimulated.  That is going to be
<br>
the world we are entering with high-bandwidth mind-meld
<br>
communications availability.   Its going to be very scarey
<br>
and very rewarding at the same time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once we have enough ability to perform this Moravekian trick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and start to replace neurons with other material people will finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize that even if the external behavior remains the same, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenal conscious qualites will cease to exist.  The people will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally discover (or finally realize what we've all known all along)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our consciousness knowledge is constructed of phenomenal qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though what this conscious stuff is phenomenally like can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated, there is nothing really and fundamentally like it.
</em><br>
<p>I'd mildly disagree -- if the foundation is sensory qualia
<br>
as experienced by a majority can be qualified and understood
<br>
(i.e. these physical stimulants result in &quot;these&quot; qualia
<br>
recreations) then the basis for a translation mapping
<br>
can be put into effect.  You can even develop a system for
<br>
assessing and communicating the &quot;variance&quot; from the baseline that
<br>
individuals may have due to genetic or experiental differences.
<br>
Provided you map that back onto something that when communicated
<br>
&quot;recreates&quot; the same experiences as were generated in the
<br>
original situation it doesn't matter whether or not I say
<br>
to you 343403 or &quot;red&quot;.
<br>
<p>The experiences perceived by the brain are &quot;physical&quot; phenomena.
<br>
To argue that they cannot be quantified and communicated (if that
<br>
is what you are suggesting) is to argue that there is some &quot;magic&quot;
<br>
afoot.  If &quot;red&quot; is experienced as the pattern of firing of &quot;this&quot;
<br>
collection of neurons and I can recreate that pattern of firing
<br>
in an identical collection of different neurons, I would assert
<br>
that both of those cases are instantiations of &quot;red&quot;.
<br>
<p>So long as I can recreate the pattern (and the pattern has the
<br>
same interpretation in two different &quot;contexts&quot;) then I can
<br>
transfer the thougts.
