<p><em>&gt; &gt; There are growing numbers of us that take these issues to heart. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have long thought about starting a retail store where everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; available was &quot;Made In America&quot;. I think these would prove far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; popular than many people think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a good idea, but why stop there?  How about a &quot;Made in Nebraska&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store for Nebraskans, and similarly for other states?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or better still, &quot;Made in Dubuque&quot;, &quot;Made in Palm Springs&quot;, &quot;Made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Talahassee&quot; stores, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, this whole business about trade is a bunch of nonsense, really.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why give your money to someone else when you can keep it right here at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home.  Build and make everything yourself: shop at your own &quot;Made at My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; House&quot; store and you won't ship any of your money off your own property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's good to keep your money within your country, surely it's even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better to keep it within your state, better still within your city,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and best of all within your house.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully the fallacy here is clear: the advantage of trade is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it allows people in different areas to specialize in different things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is more efficient and less wasteful than trying to do everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locally.  The wider the range of talents and resources available, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater are the opportunities for finding the best possible match of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people and production.  Trade on a worldwide basis maximizes available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources for everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most efficient system is one where you buy the goods that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheapest, regardless of where they are produced.  Anything else is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throwing money away.  You're hurting yourself and those around you by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boycotting trade opportunities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<p>I think that is not so simple.  For example, it is good to shop around for
<br>
bargains, but also you must consider the premiums of cost.
