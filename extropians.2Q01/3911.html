<p>Microsoft is making an ass of itself once again.  If innovation and
<br>
profitability and all other goodness and apple pie was not present in
<br>
Open Source then Microsoft would have nothing to say about it.  It would
<br>
not need to.  But MS cannot with a straight face claim that proprietary
<br>
software and methods like its own are at the forefront of innovation,
<br>
give users and innovators outside of Microsoft the maximal value,  much
<br>
less that they are more secure and more dependable.  Microsoft is the
<br>
enemy of progress, not those of us who see that progress is best served
<br>
by opening software and and other information sources that greatly grow
<br>
in value by being maximally available and useful.  
<br>
<p>It is true that the old pure software business models are in trouble. 
<br>
But it does not follow that the future must be constrained to support
<br>
old models that have been found seriously lacking.
