<p><p>A Cure for Poverty
<br>
<p>By ANDREW SOLOMON
<br>
<p><p>What if you could help end people's economic problems by treating their 
<br>
depression?
<br>
<p>Wendy was born just below the poverty line, where she spent the next 30 
<br>
years of her life. These were grim times for her. When she was 6, a disabled 
<br>
friend of her alcoholic grandmother began abusing her sexually. In seventh 
<br>
grade she began to withdraw. &quot;I felt there was no reason to go on,&quot; she 
<br>
says. &quot;I did my schoolwork and everything, but I was not happy in any way. I 
<br>
would just stay to myself. Everyone thought I couldn't talk for a while, 
<br>
because for a few years there I wouldn't say anything to anyone.&quot; Her first 
<br>
boyfriend, from her neighborhood in the slums around Washington, was 
<br>
physically and verbally brutal. After the birth of her first child, when she 
<br>
was 17, she managed to &quot;escape from him, I don't know how.&quot; Not long after, 
<br>
Wendy, a petite African-American woman with grave eyes and a wide mouth, was 
<br>
raped by a family friend. Soon after that, under pressure from her family, 
<br>
she married a man who was also abusive. She had three more children by him 
<br>
in the next two years. &quot;He was abusing the children too, even though he was 
<br>
the one who wanted them, cursing and yelling all the time, and the 
<br>
spankings, I couldn't take that, over any little thing, and I couldn't 
<br>
protect them from it.&quot; She also had to assume responsibility at this time 
<br>
for her sister's children, because the sister was addicted to crack cocaine.
<br>
<p>Wendy began to experience major depression -- not simply the generalized 
<br>
despair that might be expected of someone in her position, but an organic 
<br>
illness that was utterly disabling: &quot;I'd had a job, but I had to quit 
<br>
because I just couldn't do it. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I felt 
<br>
like there was no reason to do anything. I'm already small, and I was losing 
<br>
more and more weight. I wouldn't get up to eat or anything. I just didn't 
<br>
care. Sometimes I would sit and just cry, cry, cry. Over nothing. I had 
<br>
nothing to say to my own children. After they left the house, I would get in 
<br>
bed with the door locked. I feared when they came home, 3 o'clock, and it 
<br>
just came so fast. I was just so tired.&quot; Wendy began to take pills, mostly 
<br>
painkillers. &quot;It could be Tylenol or anything for pain, a lot of it, though, 
<br>
or anything I could get to put me to sleep.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Finally one day, in an unusual show of energy, Wendy went to the 
<br>
family-planning clinic to get a tubal ligation. At 28, she was responsible 
<br>
for 11 children, and the thought of another one petrified her. She happened 
<br>
to go in when Jeanne Miranda, an associate professor of psychiatry at 
<br>
Georgetown University, was screening subjects for a study of poor people 
<br>
suffering from depression. &quot;She was definitely depressed, about as depressed 
<br>
as anyone I'd ever seen,&quot; recalls Miranda, who gave Wendy the diagnosis and 
<br>
swiftly put her into group therapy. &quot;It was a relief to know there was 
<br>
something specific wrong,&quot; Wendy says. &quot;They asked me to come to a meeting, 
<br>
and that was so hard. I didn't talk. I just cried.&quot;
<br>
<p>On any given day, roughly 18 million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria 
<br>
for mood disorders, meaning that they have reached an emotional low that 
<br>
impairs their functioning. Three million of those are children. Depression 
<br>
claims more years of useful life in America than war, cancer and AIDS put 
<br>
together, according to the World Health Organization's World Health Report 
<br>
2000. And the indigent depressed are among the most severely disabled 
<br>
populations in this country. There are no reliable figures on how many of 
<br>
these people there are, but 13.7 percent of Americans live below the poverty 
<br>
line, and according to one recent study, about 42 percent of heads of 
<br>
households receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children meet the 
<br>
criteria for clinical depression -- more than three times the national 
<br>
average.
<br>
<p><p>Despite the extended debates in the last decade about depression's causes, 
<br>
it seems fairly clear that it is usually the consequence of a genetic 
<br>
vulnerability activated by external stress. Most people have some level of 
<br>
genetic vulnerability. Those with a high vulnerability can have it triggered 
<br>
by a fairly minor event; those with a low degree of vulnerability will be 
<br>
triggered only by more significant trauma. But among the indigent, the 
<br>
traumas are so terrible and so frequent, says Miranda, that searching for 
<br>
the depressed among them is like checking for emphysema among coal miners. 
<br>
The depression rate among the poor is the highest of any social grouping in 
<br>
the United States, so high that many don't notice or question it. &quot;If this 
<br>
is how all your friends are,&quot; Miranda says, &quot;it begins to have a certain 
<br>
terrible normality to it.&quot;
<br>
<p>In travels to some fairly remote parts of the world, I found that much the 
<br>
same rules apply to trauma-prone populations everywhere. Survivors of the 
<br>
Khmer Rouge in Cambodia have an extremely high rate of depression. Phaly 
<br>
Nuon, a Cambodian woman who has founded a treatment center and an orphanage 
<br>
in Phnom Penh, describes seeing women who had made it through the horrific 
<br>
years of war only to become so depressed afterward that they let their own 
<br>
children starve to death in the resettlement camps. She said that these 
<br>
women, born to grim lives of rural poverty, had been disabled by what they 
<br>
had seen. I found similar phenomena among the Inuit of Greenland, tribal 
<br>
peoples in Senegal, the urban poor in Russia. Depression rates are very high 
<br>
all around the world among people with hard lives, and these people tend to 
<br>
be disproportionately poor.
<br>
<p>Depression can be difficult enough to recognize among the affluent, but if 
<br>
you're way down the socioeconomic ladder, the signs may be even harder to 
<br>
distinguish. When someone in the middle classes becomes depressed and 
<br>
suddenly finds that he can't function at a high level, can't work, begins to 
<br>
withdraw, he is likely to attract the attention of friends and family 
<br>
members. But if you're poor, these symptoms don't seem much of a change. 
<br>
Your life has always been lousy; you've never been able to get or hold a 
<br>
decent job; you've never expected to accomplish much; and you've never 
<br>
entertained the idea that you have much control over what happens to you.
<br>
<p>The depressed poor perceive themselves to be supremely helpless -- so 
<br>
helpless that they neither seek nor embrace support. This means that most 
<br>
people who are poor and depressed stay poor and depressed. Poverty is 
<br>
depressing, and depression, leading as it does to dysfunction and isolation, 
<br>
is impoverishing.
<br>
<p>The poor tend to have a passive relationship to fate: their lack of 
<br>
self-determination makes them far more likely to accommodate problems than 
<br>
to solve them (they are, by extension, far less likely to commit suicide 
<br>
than are the empowered). This passivity also causes them to accept treatment 
<br>
as passively as they accept their own misery, which means they can be helped 
<br>
through programs of assertive outreach. Medicaid recipients qualify for 
<br>
extensive care, but they have to claim it, and depressed people do not 
<br>
exercise rights or claim what should be theirs, even if they have the rare 
<br>
sophistication to recognize their own condition. They can be saved only by 
<br>
pressing insight onto them, often through muscular exhortation.
<br>
<p>Miranda is one of a small group of therapists who embrace this idea of 
<br>
assertive intervention. &quot;If you treat their depression,&quot; says Miranda, &quot;you 
<br>
give them a new world.&quot;
<br>
<p>Wendy was not an easy subject at first. On more than one occasion a member 
<br>
of Miranda's staff had to go to her house and persuade her to come out. She 
<br>
said she had no time. She was taciturn and kept people at a distance. &quot;Then 
<br>
they kept calling, telling me to come, pestering and insisting, like they 
<br>
wouldn't let go. I didn't like the first meetings. But I listened to the 
<br>
other women and realized that they had the same problems I was having, and I 
<br>
began to tell them things. I'd never told anyone those things. And the 
<br>
therapist asked us all these questions to change how we thought. And I just 
<br>
felt myself changing, and I began to get stronger.&quot;
<br>
<p>After two months of group therapy, Wendy told her husband that she was 
<br>
leaving. &quot;There was no arguing because I just didn't argue back. I just told 
<br>
him, 'I'm gone.' I was so strong. I was so happy.&quot;
<br>
<p>It took two more months of therapy before Wendy found a job. Now, while she 
<br>
goes to work at a child-care center for the Navy, her children and her 
<br>
sister's go to school or another local child-care center. With her new 
<br>
salary, she has set herself and the children up in a new apartment. And a 
<br>
year into her group therapy, she plans to continue for as long as Miranda's 
<br>
program is operating. &quot;My kids are so much happier,&quot; Wendy says. &quot;They want 
<br>
to do things all the time now. We talk for hours every day. We read and do 
<br>
homework all together. We joke around. We all talk about careers, and before 
<br>
they didn't even think careers. I talk to them about drugs, and they've seen 
<br>
my sister, and they keep clean now. They don't cry like they used to. They 
<br>
don't fight like they did.
<br>
<p>&quot;I never thought I would get this far. It feels good to be happy. I don't 
<br>
know how long it's going to last, but I sure hope it's forever.&quot; She smiles 
<br>
and shakes her head in wonder. &quot;And if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that, 
<br>
I'd still be at home in bed, if I was still alive at all.&quot; Miranda says, 
<br>
&quot;There are thousands of success stories as magical as this one, just waiting 
<br>
for appropriate interventions.&quot;
<br>
<p>The treatments Wendy received did not include psychopharmaceutical 
<br>
intervention. What was it that enabled this metamorphosis? In part, it was 
<br>
simply the steady glow of attention from the doctors with whom she worked. 
<br>
In part, it was a cognitive shift. Miranda described Wendy as &quot;clearly&quot; 
<br>
having depression, but this had not been clear to Wendy even when she 
<br>
suffered extreme symptoms. The labeling of her complaint was an essential 
<br>
step toward her recovery from it. What can be named and described can be 
<br>
contained: the word &quot;depression&quot; separated Wendy's illness from her 
<br>
personality. If all the things she disliked in herself could be grouped 
<br>
elegantly together as aspects of a disease, that left her good qualities as 
<br>
the &quot;real&quot; Wendy, and it was much easier for her to like this real Wendy and 
<br>
to turn this real Wendy against the problems that afflicted her. To be given 
<br>
the idea of depression is to master a socially powerful linguistic tool. 
<br>
There are no people so starved for this vocabulary as the indigent 
<br>
depressed, which is why basic tools like cognitive group therapy can be so 
<br>
utterly transforming for them.
<br>
<p>Many women in Wendy's situation would be even more expeditiously helped by 
<br>
pharmaceuticals. There are four impediments to such broadband treatment 
<br>
programs. The first is that the indigent populations who might be helped by 
<br>
medication have never really been identified. The second is that to be 
<br>
effective, antidepressant medications must be taken on an ongoing basis over 
<br>
an extended period of time. The lower people's education levels, the less 
<br>
likely they are to take a medication that does not have any immediately 
<br>
palpable effect when they take it. Such people are also unlikely to continue 
<br>
to take their pills once their symptoms have lifted. The third, of course, 
<br>
is cost, though in absolute terms it costs less to provide medication than 
<br>
it does to provide the social services that the indigent require. The fourth 
<br>
is a mode of transmission. Pharmaceutical executives to whom I mentioned all 
<br>
the above said they would willingly set up programs to discount medication 
<br>
for use in these populations if there were a way to convey it. &quot;I simply 
<br>
didn't know that such a phenomenon existed on the scale you are describing,&quot; 
<br>
one executive told me. In the absence of government programs to facilitate 
<br>
the distribution of antidepressants to this population, however, even the 
<br>
most well-intentioned members of the pharmaceutical industry are stymied.
<br>
<p>The privately financed Treatment Advocacy Center is the most conservative 
<br>
body issuing policy on treatment, and its position is that people whose 
<br>
condition can be improved through treatment should receive it whether they 
<br>
want to or not. It is their view that those who resist treatment place an 
<br>
unconscionable and unnecessary burden on society. The Bazelon Center for 
<br>
Mental Health Law, a nonprofit policy group at the other end of the 
<br>
spectrum, believes that commitment should almost always be voluntary and 
<br>
defines mental illness as interpretive. The A.C.L.U. takes the middle 
<br>
ground. It has published a statement that &quot;the freedom to be wandering the 
<br>
streets, psychotic, ill and untreated, when there is a reasonable prospect 
<br>
of effective treatment, is not freedom; it is abandonment&quot; -- though it also 
<br>
supports the right of people to make decisions about their own lives. The 
<br>
problem is that desperate people often dislike help because they do not 
<br>
believe that help will set them free. The answer is neither forced treatment 
<br>
nor abandonment; it is a process of forceful seduction predicated on the 
<br>
principle that those who are treated will be glad after the fact to have 
<br>
received such attention.
<br>
<p>Joseph Rogers, the head of the Mental Health Association of Southeastern 
<br>
Pennsylvania, was indigent and depressed himself at one time; he spent a 
<br>
year living on a bench in Central Park before being drawn into an outreach 
<br>
program. &quot;People who are isolated and lost are usually desperate for a 
<br>
little human connection,&quot; Rogers says. &quot;Outreach can work. You just have to 
<br>
be willing to go out and engage them and re-engage them until they're ready 
<br>
to come with you.&quot; Rogers has helped to make Pennsylvania one of the most 
<br>
progressive states in the nation for mental health. In fact many people from 
<br>
neighboring states get shipped into Pennsylvania so they can take advantage 
<br>
of the systems there.
<br>
<p>Rogers also has created a chain of what he calls &quot;drop-in centers,&quot; which 
<br>
are street-level storefronts, usually staffed by people who are themselves 
<br>
recovering from mental illnesses. This creates employment for the people who 
<br>
are just beginning to cope with a structured environment, and it gives 
<br>
people who are in bad shape a place to go and receive advice. Drop-in 
<br>
centers provide a transit zone between mental isolation and companionship.
<br>
<p>Popular wisdom holds that you need to address unemployment before you start 
<br>
worrying about the fancy business of the mental health of the unemployed. 
<br>
And greater prosperity is a good trigger for recovery. But it is perhaps 
<br>
easier and equally reasonable to treat the depression itself so that these 
<br>
people can alter their own lives.
<br>
<p>Our failure to identify and treat the indigent depressed is not only cruel 
<br>
but also costly. Many of the depressed poor are welfare recipients who 
<br>
cannot hold jobs. They are given to substance abuse and other 
<br>
self-destructive behaviors. They are sometimes violent. Infants of depressed 
<br>
mothers show brain-wave patterns different from those of other infants, 
<br>
according to a study by Tiffany Field, chair of the Touch Research 
<br>
Institute. These altered patterns seem to relate to the closing down of 
<br>
essential brain circuits that, if they do not function in childhood, are 
<br>
probably inoperative later on. Treat the depression in the mother, and the 
<br>
infant's brain waves are likely to normalize. When a depressed mother is not 
<br>
treated, her children tend to end up in the welfare and prison systems: the 
<br>
sons of mothers with untreated depression are eight times more likely to 
<br>
become juvenile delinquents as are other children. Daughters of depressed 
<br>
mothers will have earlier puberty than other girls, according to a recent 
<br>
paper by Bruce Ellis and Judy Garber in the journal Child Development. And 
<br>
early puberty is usually associated with promiscuity, early pregnancy and 
<br>
mood disorders.
<br>
<p>According to the 1998 Green Book of the House of Representatives Committee 
<br>
on Ways and Means, state and federal government spends roughly $20 billion 
<br>
on cash transfers to poor nonelderly adults and their children, and roughly 
<br>
the same amount for food stamps for such families. If one makes the 
<br>
conservative estimate that 25 percent of people on welfare are depressed, 
<br>
that half of them can be treated successfully and that of that percentage, 
<br>
two-thirds could return to productive, at least part-time, work, factoring 
<br>
in treatment costs, that would still reduce welfare costs by as much as 8 
<br>
percent -- a savings of almost $3.5 billion per year. Because the federal 
<br>
government also provides health care and other transfers for such families, 
<br>
the true savings could be quite a bit higher.
<br>
<p>The dollar cost of interventionist treatment of depression is really quite 
<br>
small; the dollar cost of not treating depression is enormous. &quot;Postponement 
<br>
of intervention does not result in savings,&quot; Representative Marge Roukema, a 
<br>
Republican from New Jersey and the co-chairwoman of the Working Group on 
<br>
Mental Illness, says. &quot;You're really building in greater costs.&quot;
<br>
<p>For more than a decade, Glenn Treisman of Johns Hopkins University has been 
<br>
studying and treating depression among indigent H.I.V.-positive and AIDS 
<br>
populations in Baltimore, most of whom are also substance-abusers. &quot;Many 
<br>
people get H.I.V. when they can't muster the energy to care anymore,&quot; 
<br>
Treisman says. &quot;These are people who are utterly demoralized by life and 
<br>
don't see any point in it. If we had treatments more broadly available for 
<br>
depression, I would guess from my clinical experience that the rate of 
<br>
H.I.V. infection in this country would be cut in half at least, with 
<br>
enormous consequent public-health savings.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mental-Health Services are still focused primarily on the noisy disorders, 
<br>
with schizophrenia and mania at the top of the list. &quot;Of course we want to 
<br>
help nonviolent mentally ill people just as much as we want to help violent 
<br>
ones,&quot; Roukema told me. &quot;But to draw any kind of substantial support, we 
<br>
have to show people that it serves their urgent self-interest to do 
<br>
something about mental-health care for the poor. We have to talk about 
<br>
preventing atrocious crimes that could be visited on them or their 
<br>
constituents at any moment. We can't talk simply about a better and more 
<br>
prosperous and more humane state.&quot;
<br>
<p>There is no discussion in Congress at present about depression among the 
<br>
uninsured. Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who has been the joint 
<br>
sponsor of several important mental-health bills, says this situation is 
<br>
unlikely to change. &quot;If you're asking whether we can expect much change 
<br>
simply because that change would serve everyone's advantage in immediate 
<br>
economic and human terms,&quot; Domenici says, &quot;I regret to tell you that the 
<br>
answer is no.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is hard to find anyone in Congress who is opposed on principle to healing 
<br>
the mentally ill. &quot;The opposition is competition,&quot; says Representative John 
<br>
Porter, an Illinois Republican who until January was the chairman of the 
<br>
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. 
<br>
Nonetheless, while declarations about the tragic nature of suicide and the 
<br>
danger of psychiatric complaints accumulate on the Congressional record, 
<br>
legislation pertinent to these statistics does not pass easily. &quot;Progress 
<br>
here is excruciatingly gradual,&quot; says Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, 
<br>
who has made regular attempts to introduce comprehensive legislation for 
<br>
mental-illness coverage. &quot;The uninsured haven't even made it onto the radar 
<br>
screen around here yet.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are programs, even some good ones, that are available to the poor 
<br>
mentally ill, but they exist inside hospitals. You have to find them 
<br>
yourself. Public-relations campaigns for treating mental illnesses -- signs 
<br>
on buses, TV ad spots and so on -- have had some success at bringing people 
<br>
into clinics, but the idea that indigent depressed people will ever have the 
<br>
wherewithal to seek and find help, even if they did figure out for 
<br>
themselves that they were depressed, is ludicrous. A program that did a 
<br>
basic mental-health screening at family-planning clinics or at job centers 
<br>
or at places where welfare checks are distributed might allow us at least to 
<br>
identify the people who are currently suffering from illness.
<br>
<p>But the best place to start would probably be the welfare rolls. Major 
<br>
depression is frequently triggered by stresses, and there is no question 
<br>
that the lives of welfare recipients are extremely stressful. At the moment, 
<br>
however, welfare officers do no significant screening for depression. 
<br>
Welfare programs are essentially run by administrators, who do little or no 
<br>
actual social work. What tends to be noted in welfare reports as 
<br>
noncompliance is in many instances motivated by psychiatric trouble.
<br>
<p>Some pilot studies are under way on the treatment of depression among the 
<br>
poor, and the results appear surprisingly consistent. I was given full 
<br>
access to subjects from several of these studies -- some involved therapy, 
<br>
others medication, still others a combination of the two. To my surprise, 
<br>
everyone I met felt that his or her lot had improved during treatment. They 
<br>
felt better about their lives, and they lived better. Even when faced with 
<br>
insurmountable obstacles, they progressed, often fast and sometimes far. 
<br>
Over and over again, as I spoke to more poor people who had been treated for 
<br>
depression, I heard tones of astonishment. How, after so many things had 
<br>
gone wrong for them, had they been swept up by this help that had changed 
<br>
their entire lives? &quot;I asked the Lord to send me an angel,&quot; one woman told 
<br>
me. &quot;And he answered my prayers.&quot;
