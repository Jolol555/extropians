<p><em>&gt; is anyone using Python or Ruby for anything substantial and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product-quality, or are these languages only good for writing quick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little unsupported hacks?
</em><br>
<p>I'm currently involved in a substantial software development project much of
<br>
which is written in Python. Originally most of the code was C/C++ with bits
<br>
of Perl, Python, shell scripts, etc. (It's for the Unix platform.) Over the
<br>
last year or so, we've been switching as much as possible to Python. As an
<br>
ancient software guy with lots of experience on all the major platforms and
<br>
with lots of development environments, languages, and what have you, my take
<br>
is that our conversion to Python has been a very pleasant experience (just
<br>
as we anticipated would be). I believe Python is well-suited to sizeable
<br>
software projects. As you would expect, the overall process is much more
<br>
productive (and more fun!) than doing similar jobs with C/C++. The main
<br>
downside to use of Python, as with any &quot;dynamically-typed&quot; language, is that
<br>
few errors are caught at compile time, but must be found at run time. So
<br>
it's a good idea to do plenty of coverage-oriented testing. Of course, even
<br>
strongly-typed languages don't catch everything at compile time either --
<br>
it's a matter of degree. But, all in all, Python gets a big thumbs up from
<br>
me and my co-workers in the context of our product. It's definitely not just
<br>
for quick hacks -- it is a serious development tool. Of course, be aware
<br>
that Python not as fast as C (yet it is not a slouch either), so that would
<br>
be a factor in making the choice.
<br>
<p>Now -- about Ruby. I have recently become aware of Ruby, and I REALLY LIKE
<br>
IT! Although we are not scrapping our Python code to rewrite it in Ruby, I
<br>
have pretty much switched over to it for my personal stuff. Even though
<br>
Python is a nice, clean language, Ruby is even cleaner. It's a step closer
<br>
to what Python wants to be for Python 3000 that Python is now: a &quot;pure&quot;
<br>
object oriented language rather than a hybrid. And most of the things that I
<br>
find rather annoying about Python are done right in Ruby. As a small
<br>
example, to read lines of a file, the idomatic code is:
<br>
<p>Python 2.0   (can you cite another language that requires 4 lines of
<br>
overhead to read lines?)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while 1:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line = file.readline()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if not line:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;process the line&gt;
<br>
<p>Python 2.1    (finally! -- better, shorter, but wierd!)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while line in file.xreadlines():
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;process the line&gt;
<br>
<p>Ruby      (uses a general language feature (that Python does not have),
<br>
rather than a special purpose, rather hacky, technique)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;while line = file.gets()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;process the line&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end
<br>
<p>On use of Ruby for large projects: Ruby seems to have all the software
<br>
engineering goodness that Python has, so I would think that Ruby and Python
<br>
would be in the same ballpark for big development.
<br>
<p>Contrasting Ruby and Python:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python is older, more mature, and has more 3rd-party support.
<br>
Object-orientedness seems to be an afterthought. Shortcomings in
<br>
expressiveness require excessively verbose code in some cases.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ruby is pure object oriented, has a extremely well-chosen set of
<br>
language features, in my experience is very solid, and even more fun to code
<br>
than Python. 3rd-party stuff is not as extensive as Python's yet, but there
<br>
is already quite a bit and its growing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- In many ways, the languages are surprisingly similar. Converting
<br>
existing Python programs to Ruby is really easy.
<br>
<p>In summary, both are excellent languages, suitable for substantial software
<br>
development. I am glad to see the growing interest in Ruby, because it
<br>
deserves be noticed as a worthy alternative to Python, Perl, etc.
