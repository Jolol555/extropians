<em>&gt; &gt; Given pressure from consumer/voters, for example, the temptation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government is usually to overutilize a good. That is why people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;loving&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; national parks to death and why subsidized sugar farmers in Florida have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been systematically destroying the Everglades. In both cases, the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system is subordinated to political distribution of goods, and the
</em><br>
outcome
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is always predictable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know the whole story about the sugar farmers and the Everglades,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I doubt that the free market would protect a bunch of stinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swampland.  The only way to make money off it would be tourism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charity, and the demand won't be large enough to protect the vast expanses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Everglades.  So someone pushing free market solutions is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypocritical if they imply that markets would save the Everglades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They'll save a little piece of them, a DisneyGlades with swamp rides,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not 5000 square miles.
</em><br>
<p>What would most likely have happened under a free market is NOT that someone
<br>
would go out of their way to protect swamps -- though individuals and groups
<br>
certainly wouldn't be precluded from buying up and protecting it
<br>
themselves -- but that the cost would be too high to develop.  Investments
<br>
would go elsewhere.
<br>
<p>We see this with the lumber, mining, and farming industries elsewhere, e.g.,
<br>
in the American Southwest on the last.  There, government supplied water,
<br>
roads, and power has made it cost less to farm basically crappy land.
<br>
Without government subsidization, I don't think anyone would bother -- at
<br>
least not in huge enough numbers to have much of an environmental impact.
<br>
(Ditto for Israelis farming the Negev Desert and around the Dead Sea.  Ditto
<br>
for Arabians growing wheat.)
<br>
<p>With the lumber industry, government built roads as well as the leasing
<br>
system make it profitable for these companies to strip forests.  If the
<br>
government did not build the roads and otherwise subsidize the industry,
<br>
these companies would feel the full cost of their activities.  Also, any
<br>
rise in wood prices would help the market to find substitutes or more
<br>
efficient means of supply.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
