<p><em>&gt; What do extropians consider to be the most common errors made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest mistake everyone makes is thinking that one can
<br>
&quot;hope&quot; or &quot;have faith&quot; that there is already any kind of a higher
<br>
power.  If one believes or accepts that there is already some higher
<br>
power (Gods, ETs or whatever) out there hiding from us, yet watching
<br>
and occasionally influencing our existence, while there is still evils
<br>
like isolation, suffering, death... is just the opposite of faith and
<br>
hope.  Accepting that there is any higher power, while there is evil,
<br>
is the ultimate in giving up in despair.  If such really does already
<br>
exist we are eternally screwed and we have no hope.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one accepts that there is already a higher power, then one
<br>
must spend his days trying to theodicies or justify evil in the face
<br>
of this higher power.  If one accepts this, they have no hope of
<br>
overcoming evil, even if they become as powerful as this higher power.
<br>
For if this higher, even all powerful being, can't do it, how can we
<br>
ever hope to do any better!?  The theist spends all his days in the
<br>
futile effort trying to come up with various absurd theodicies in an
<br>
attempt to justify it and their already all powerful God.  They can't
<br>
hope to overcome evil, so they must instead try to justify it and some
<br>
how attempt to try to twist it into being good.  The theist can't hope
<br>
to overcome evil, but instead merely attempts to justify and accept
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you &quot;hope&quot; there isn't already a higher power, then and
<br>
only then can you have &quot;faith&quot; that perhaps such evils aren't all that
<br>
hard to overcome and aren't all that necessary.  You can work with the
<br>
faith and hope that we are about to overcome all such evils.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A theists that claims to have faith and hope is a liar.  The
<br>
atheist is the only one that can have true and honest faith and hope.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite how blatantly obvious this is, for some reason, no one
<br>
can see it.
<br>
