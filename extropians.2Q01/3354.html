<p>
&quot;Image problem&quot; is the wrong phrase, perhaps, Eli.  I didn't use that phrase
<br>
and wouldn't have.
<br>
<p>My point is: Transhumanists **should**, on the merits of their ideas, be
<br>
widely recognized as intellectual and cultural leaders, but, at this stage,
<br>
they are generally not.  One of our goals should be to change this.
<br>
<p>If they were, then their opinion on things like human cloning would be taken
<br>
more seriously by the public at large.
<br>
<p>Perhaps my intuition as to how this goal might be achieved is faulty, that's
<br>
quite possible.  But anyway, my goal is not so much to solve an &quot;image
<br>
problem&quot; as to project transhumanists to a leadership position on the world
<br>
stage.
<br>
<p>As for my article in FAZ, I would say that the attitude YOU are displaying
<br>
in this e-mail exchange, my friend, is pretty close to the attitude I was
<br>
writing about in that article.  Basically, Eli, as much as I like and admire
<br>
you, the attitude &quot;Let others worry about the starving people in the Sudan;
<br>
my job is to save them by building a Friendly AI that will produce the
<br>
Singularity&quot; sort of gets on my nerves.  Perhaps this is purely my own human
<br>
irrationality.  Something in my heart tells me that we'll be better
<br>
people -- and produce friendlier AI's -- if we allocate some of our personal
<br>
energy to tangible compassion in the here-and-now as well as trying to help
<br>
people through long-term technological projects.  But this isn't the kind of
<br>
thing for which one can make a logical argument.
<br>
<p>So, I'll shut up now ;&gt;
