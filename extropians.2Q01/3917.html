</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Some points of clarification. The beta version is available now. This
<br>
version does not affect the mailing list at all, the ratings are only
<br>
available on the web archive. Also, the ratings apply to the content, not
<br>
the author.
<br>
<p>The web archives are available at &lt;<a href="http://forum.javien.com/forum/index.php">http://forum.javien.com/forum/index.php</a>&gt;,
<br>
and should work with any web browser. There is a lag of a few minutes
<br>
between the mail broadcast and it appearing in the archive.
<br>
<p>To rate archived content, you need to install client software (currently
<br>
only available for Windows, Linux is in the works). To register to get the
<br>
client software, go to &lt;<a href="http://www.javien.com/members/">http://www.javien.com/members/</a>&gt;.
<br>
<p>The ratings use collaborative filtering. That is, the recommended values
<br>
that you see will be specific to you. This works by correlating your ratings
<br>
with those of other users. For example, when Natasha rates on the basis of
<br>
adherence to 'the Extropian principles and a variety of essays that embody
<br>
content reflecting the goals, thoughts and feelings of &quot;Extropy&quot;', she will
<br>
then see recommendations for content based on the ratings of other users who
<br>
share that attitude.
<br>
<p>To enter ratings you must create a pseudonymous identity, an &quot;agent&quot;, which
<br>
has a micropayment account associated with it. We are still restricting the
<br>
beta somewhat in that only Extropy Institute members will be given money in
<br>
those accounts. But with this email, we are opening it up so that anyone on
<br>
this list may get the client software and try out the rating system, but
<br>
their account balance will remain at zero.
<br>
<p>Enjoy!
