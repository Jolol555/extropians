On Wed, 21 Mar 2001 Robert J. Bradbury wrote a long
<br>
paragraph diving into &quot;genes vs. environment&quot;,
<br>
&quot;unconscious vs. conscious&quot;, the Turing test, zombies,
<br>
Game Theory, and the course of history!
<br>
<p>I have studied it at length, and I think that there are
<br>
some very valid points there, but I don't think that
<br>
we mean the same thing by &quot;consciousness&quot;, and I know
<br>
that we don't mean the same thing by &quot;zombie&quot;.
<br>
<p>I would heartily recommend that you read parts of Daniel
<br>
Dennett's &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, if for no other reason
<br>
than to find out how most philosophers use a number of terms,
<br>
and how the debates about some of these issues have been
<br>
conventionally framed.
<br>
<p>But today, and perhaps in the next several days, I'll try
<br>
to directly respond to some portion of your paragraphs.
<br>
<p>First, unless you were just joking, there really isn't
<br>
any need for:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well since I'm unsure whether I'm dealing with the &quot;real&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee (in which case I would say, &quot;no you silly dimwit, thats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply wrong&quot;) or the sim/zombie Lee (for whom I have much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sympathy), to whom I would respond, &quot;No kind sir, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would suggest you think about this a bit further&quot;)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [The lack of cycles available to the sim'ed Lee could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain this error.]
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If you really haven't read much about these issues, e.g.,
<br>
Dennett, then perhaps it would be best to be a little
<br>
more cautious in your castigations  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is pure fantasy to believe that zombies could not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully emulated using a combination of the knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the underlying biology of humans and a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical database of how humans act in various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, to start: we may not be agreeing about what a zombie is. 
<br>
Here is Dennett's definition, p. 72-73 of Consciousness
<br>
Explained: &quot;According to common agreement among philosophers,
<br>
a zombie is or would be a human being who exhibits perfectly 
<br>
natural, alert, loquascious, vivacious behavior but is in
<br>
fact not conscious at all, but rather some sort of automaton.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, you may mean by &quot;conscious&quot; something a little
<br>
different from what the philosophers mean, (or are trying
<br>
to mean!), also.
<br>
<p>Let's proceed slowly, here, and sorry that space prevents
<br>
me from replying at length to all your points today.
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin
