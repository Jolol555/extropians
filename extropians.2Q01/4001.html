<p>That's doesn't seem real smart, genius or not.

But then again, a true genius is encouraged to be

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you can't tell already, I'm firmly at #3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You know where my cat stands.
</em><br>
<p>I'd tend towards #4 along with the cat, perhaps
<br>
yawning even wider.
<br>
<p>The discovery of my own claim to genius was
<br>
unearthed by the branch of the US government noted
<br>
for taking Pacific atols via amphibious landings.  Today
<br>
they claim they want &quot;a few good men&quot;. But at that
<br>
time - roughly coincident with the setting of Kubrick's
<br>
&quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; - they would take just about anyone,
<br>
and often did. They took me, after all.
<br>
<p>At boot camp at Parris Island, SC in mid-November '68,
<br>
we spent the better part of a day taking a battery of
<br>
standardized tests, including an IQ test.  We did this
<br>
just after getting at least 6 different immunization shots
<br>
rammed rudely into various parts of our body.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a week later, during the time we were allowed
<br>
to shower or take a dump (choices!) the DI yelled,
<br>
&quot;Lambert! Come here you crazy fuck&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Private Lambert reporting to the Drill Instructor,&quot; I
<br>
said after running to him like a fool fearing for  life
<br>
and limb.
<br>
<p>&quot;You got the highest mark on this island this year
<br>
on the IQ test.  Are you some kind of fucking genius?
<br>
Then why do you look so stupid? Do you think you're
<br>
smarter than me? Hey Ladies... Lambert here thinks
<br>
he's a fucking genius.&quot;
<br>
<p>There follwed a number of questions for which there
<br>
are only wrong answers and wrong answers get
<br>
your toes mashed with combat boots or a couple
<br>
of rigid fingers driven into your solar plexus. He
<br>
was aiming to prove that genius doesn't hold much
<br>
currency in Marine boot camp, and true value lies
<br>
in knowing the pressure points that can turn
<br>
someone unconscious faster than a network
<br>
sit-com. It was show time and I was the show.
<br>
<p>They made me take the IQ test again. While my mates
<br>
were crawling on their bellies through a swamp
<br>
somewhere, I sat taking the exact same test, this
<br>
time alone except for a corporal sitting in front of me
<br>
watching my every move. Did they think I copied my
<br>
answers from the paper of the kid from West Virginny
<br>
sitting next to me who's IQ was less than the average
<br>
yearly temperature in Nome? (true fact... one guy was
<br>
booted out because his IQ was below the lowest of low
<br>
standards, 80, I believe.)
<br>
<p>Since I took the test before and wasn't quite as
<br>
woozy from the shots nor as sleep deprived, I guess I
<br>
got a few points higher. The DI said after the second
<br>
test results came back, &quot;Lambert, I guess you are a
<br>
fucking genius after all. Who would've fucking believed
<br>
it. La dee fucking dah.&quot; I think this last sentence has
<br>
framed how I think about standardized tests ever since,
<br>
&quot;La dee fucking dah.&quot;
<br>
<p>All this did was get me noticed in a place you want to avoid
<br>
being noticed.  The practical outcome was that I was assigned
<br>
to &quot;teach&quot; Marine recruits who couldn't break down and
<br>
reassemble a rifle bindfolded within an alloted time how to
<br>
do it. In some cases this was a hopeless proposition, for
<br>
there were a couple of guys  who couldn't do that simple
<br>
task in a million years even without a blindfold or a time
<br>
limit. When they couldn't pass at the official test, I got
<br>
the shit kicked out of me again )but they never needed
<br>
such excuses anyway since the best lesson you could
<br>
ever learn was to get the shit kicked out of you for no
<br>
particular rhyme nor reason).
<br>
<p>{Anway, coming down from the USMC rant... trying
<br>
to wash away the smell of gunpowder mixed with
<br>
the sweet aroma of pot smoke and the never
<br>
forgotten ring in the ear of anti-war protests...}
<br>
<p>These days, popular educational theorists down play
<br>
the IQ tests as any full measure of intelligence. They
<br>
claim 7 types of intelligence, only a few of which are
<br>
touched on by an IQ test.  The 7 intelligences are (if I
<br>
remember correctly): mathematical, spatical, verbal,
<br>
musical, physical (mechanical), intrapersonal (knowing
<br>
one's self) , and interpersonal. It is this new way of
<br>
viewing intelligence that helps explain math genii who
<br>
can't tie their shoes or why someone like Muhamed Ali
<br>
with a measured IQ of 85 can get the world begging at
<br>
his feet, playing the press and media like a violin virtuoso.
<br>
<p>It seems your friend, Ann Marie, got short changed
<br>
in respect to interpersonal and perhaps intrapersonal
<br>
intelligence. You might untactfully explain to him
<br>
that these will catch up with him sooner  than any
<br>
inability to make correct change and are much more
<br>
useful types of intelligence than any talent for solving
<br>
complex equations in your head.  When all is said and
<br>
done about IQ tests,  &quot;La dee fucking dah&quot; about sums
<br>
it up. I think my DI was a genius.

<p><p>&gt; So I have a dear friend who has decided that
&gt; because he has scored high on a standardized
&gt; IQ test, he can call himself a genius.
<p>Wait, is this a Steely Dan song?

<p>Anyway, instead of answering your question, I'll answer a different one:
<p>Q: Is there any circumstance under which someone should *announce* that
he/she is a genius?
<p>A: No.

<p>I've long contended that &quot;genius&quot; intelligence is akin to having a chair
with one leg very long.  It can be a lifelong struggle to get the other
parts in sync.  Intuitively I'd call genius the integration of the &quot;short
legs&quot; into the precocious model.

Subject: Re: Genius Question
<p>On Mon, 7 May 2001, SpasticMutant antagonized the horn and now...
&gt;
&gt; I contend that genius is as genius does, but
&gt; the dictionary lists both definitions - one
&gt; of scoring above 140 on a standardized test,
&gt; and one whose accomplishments warrant a true
&gt; genius title.  Needless to say, his constant
&gt; whining about what a genius he is and how the
&gt; chicks really dig that is starting to annoy
&gt; me.
<p>1.) Chicks don't necessarily dig a high IQ.  I'm still alone, and I
score about 140-160 (140 on one part, off the scale == higher than 155
on the other).
2.) 140 is not genius level, in my book.  That's close enough to my IQ
that I can make comparisons to me without being too far off.  I'm
probably smart enough to say that if you compared me to two randomly
selected people, I'd be smarter than both of them, but I can't solve
twenty partial differential equations in my head or anything like that.
<p>&gt; 	1.  Automatically makes you a genius
&gt;             as defined by Stanford-Binet ad
&gt;             nauseum
<p>Is this a Stanford-Binet IQ test that he scored so well on?  If so,
aren't those typically given to children, whereas others, like the
WAIS-III are given to adults?
<p>If so, is this person not an adult?
<p>&gt; 	2.  Is a source of pride but nothing
&gt;             more
<p>That's me.  I can use it to build confidence.  There's not much else
that I can do with is.
<p>&gt; 	3.  Is totally irrelevant, and you
&gt;             view accomplishment as the real
&gt;             measure of genius.
<p>I've never accomplished very much, so I wouldn't say that.  On the other
hand, while I do feel that accomplishment is in an entirely different
category, I also think that it's quite important.  Ask this friend of
yours about a few questions that an average genius should be able to get
right:
<p>1.) Who wrote Faust? (this was the final question for the ``common
	knowledge'' section of the WAIS-III)
2.) In _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_, what is the
	significance of color?
3.) Some people say that _The Odyssey_ is more of a story about
	Telemachus than abous Odysseus.  Do you agree or disagree, and
	why?
4.) Prove that if a positive integer is not a perfect square, its square
	root is irrational.
5.) Prove Fermat's Last Theorem (the proper response is: No!  That's
	100 pages long!)
6.) Which increases faster--exp(x) or x! ?
7.) State the law of Universal Gravitation
8.) Define conservation of energy and momentum
9.) What is the speed of light equal to?  No, I mean, what are the
	constants that must be multiplied together to get the speed
	of light?
<p>10.) Here's a slide rule.  Add the following numbers...

Subject: Re: Genius Question
<p>I've always been firmly a #3 sort of person, moreso after they moved the 
bell curve ~down~ on the Stanford-Binet IQ tests a while ago (which does 
beg the question: does that mean people actually ~became~ smarter?. :-) )
<p>I have a few people in my life who I would regard as true geniuses because 
of their accomplishments and their ~applied~ intelligence, but they don't 
acknowledge that themselves (which I consider a good sign). Note the 
emphasis: it isn't how big, but how they use it. :-)
<p>Another reason why I never joined MENSA.
<p>But then again, I may be in the minority here. If so, please regard it as a 
sign that I'm not a genius.
<p>--Nancy
(who may score high, but ~really~ ain't no genius)
