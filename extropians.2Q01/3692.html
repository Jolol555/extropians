</em><br>
<em>&gt;underpriced or overpriced, but when it comes time to put their money down,

</em><br>
<p>I think this is right.  People indulge in irrational disagreement more
<br>
when the personal penalties are less.  When money is at stake, they self-
<br>
deceive less.  This is part of what I had in mind years ago when I said
<br>
that idea futures gave people an incentive to be &quot;careful and honest&quot; in
<br>
what they say. Honest not only with others, but also with themselves.
