<p><em>&gt; I would be willing to bet against you
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, let me see if I can start to propose some of the details
<br>
for such a bet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, there are at least two issues here.  #1, will
<br>
something like Steve's theory turn out to be true (and proved by
<br>
science by 2025) and second, will people, 25 years from now, Consider
<br>
Steve Lehar to be as famous as Einstein.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't mind betting $100 on both of these.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first one, how about something like this:
<br>
<p>1: By 2025, science will demonstrate that we are not consciously
<br>
directly aware of anything causally upstream from our 5 basic senses,
<br>
but rather there is a 3D world inside of our head, produced by our
<br>
brain, constructed of the conscious phenomenal and spatial qualities
<br>
that exist in our conscious awareness.  &quot;The pain isn't in the toe, it
<br>
is in the phenomenal toe in your head&quot;.  Science will have made a
<br>
significant paradigm shift to include looking for more than simple
<br>
causal properties of nature.  This will including observation and
<br>
classification of the phenomenal qualities we all subjectively
<br>
experience in consciousness, and hopefully the discovery of new qualia
<br>
not yet experienced by any human.  The primary proof of all this being
<br>
actual &quot;effing&quot; of to date &quot;ineffable&quot; phenomenal qualities, as
<br>
described in my paper &quot;A Qualia theory of Consciousness&quot;.  People and
<br>
Machines will be experienceing and hence saying things like: &quot;Oh
<br>
That's what salt tastes like!&quot; by 2025.  And because of this we will
<br>
have much more than a mere causal Turing Tests to know if other
<br>
conscious minds truly exist and what they are like...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the second one, how about something simply like:
<br>
<p>2: By 2025, Steve Lehar, because of his work with consciousness, will
<br>
be popularly considered as one of the great scientists of all time,
<br>
in a league with Einstein.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you think of any ways to improve these descriptions to
<br>
make a better, more concice, easer to judge bet?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any others out there?
<br>
