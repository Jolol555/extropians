<p>It may come as a surprise to some, but in exploration and
<br>
war, one definitely hangs a pricetag on human life.  One area
<br>
where this is most apparent is in military actions involving the
<br>
United Nations, for each nation puts a *different* price on
<br>
the heads of their soldiers.  This pricetag determines how
<br>
the soldiers are equiped for battle.
<br>
<p>This is a topic I *almost* stumbled into during my posts
<br>
on privately funded space exploration, for a private
<br>
organization may accept higher levels of risk than
<br>
NASA.  Remember that *all* astronauts are volunteers.
<br>
Furthermore, we have volunteers taking crazy risks, just
<br>
for the hell of it: such as climbing Mt. Everest, where the
<br>
chances of perishing are more than 10%.  In some years
<br>
the death toll has exceeded 20%, yet off they go.  spike
