</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If that is what he is saying, then I would disagree completely
<br>
and with Intestinal Fortitude.
<br>
<p>(As an aside, I'll simply note that it will be too bad over the
<br>
next decade that agents like those creating the Extropian archives
<br>
are not a &quot;little&quot; more intelligent about the links -- so much of
<br>
the humor in these discussions is going to be lost for the lack of
<br>
even rudimentary intelligence regarding interposting links... Sigh.
<br>
Sasha would have offered a strategy for fixing this.  Or at least I
<br>
can imagine that he would have.)
<br>
<p>There is a critical distinction between a basement level &quot;real&quot;
<br>
self-conscious entity and one that is running on a simulation of
<br>
some sort.  In the first case, you can make a reasonable claim
<br>
that you are a &quot;free agent&quot;, in the second case, that assertion
<br>
is very dubious.  In the first case you are a pseudo-random
<br>
manifestation of the computronium of the real &quot;universe&quot;, in
<br>
the second case you are a manufactured being functioning as
<br>
a lab rat in an experiment (most probably).  For Nick's &quot;simulation&quot;
<br>
vs. &quot;real&quot; &quot;morality&quot; (?) to hold as equivalent, you have to damn as
<br>
immoral many scientific experiments now involving the genetic or
<br>
environmental manipulation of mice or rats.  No they are not &quot;self-aware&quot;
<br>
but one cannot simply throw out our perceived degree of self-awareness or
<br>
self-consciousness.  For example, Data, unlike humans can run a
<br>
&quot;self-diagnostic&quot;.  He (hopefully) can &quot;discover&quot; if his mental
<br>
state has been corrupted by radiation damage or viruses and allow
<br>
that to factor into his assessment of the reliability of his positions
<br>
or conclusions.  Can &quot;self-conscious&quot; humans do this?  Given the
<br>
ability to be aware of and run self-diagnostics, one would
<br>
presumably assume that such individuals have a higher level of
<br>
self-&quot;consciousness&quot; than that which humans currently lay claim to.
<br>
<p>However, I think few humans alive today would have reservations
<br>
about reducing Data back to his constituent atoms (he is a cyborg
<br>
after all) compared with reducing a flesh-and-blood &quot;human&quot; back into
<br>
cosmic dust.  Human valuations on perceived self-consciousness
<br>
are highly context specific.
<br>
<p>To be horribly graphic about the distinction, we, in our current
<br>
world seem to allow a critical distinction between the situation
<br>
in which I &quot;really&quot; abduct a woman, brutally abuse her and
<br>
then finally kill her and dispose of her body in some remote
<br>
location and the situation in which I simply &quot;imagine&quot; doing that.
<br>
(For the women on the list, we can translate this &quot;doing&quot; vs.
<br>
&quot;thinking about it&quot; analogy to cutting off self-perceived 'valuable'
<br>
body parts of males who have 'dissed' you at one time or another,
<br>
frying them up on the stove and feeding them to your dog or cat).
<br>
[I may sexist, but I try to be an equal opportunity sexist... :-)]
<br>
The critical distinction in our society seems to be *whatever*
<br>
you &quot;think&quot; is ok, but we will regulate what you &quot;do&quot;.  In
<br>
the SI reality, what you &quot;think&quot; becomes manifest in a sub-SI
<br>
reality, i.e. it becomes &quot;doing&quot;.  But the doing is completely
<br>
artificial and divorced from the reality in which you operate
<br>
(as my &quot;thoughts&quot; are from what I do when I go out and take a
<br>
walk in the &quot;real world&quot;).
<br>
<p>Now, Eliezer has proposed that the SysOp doesn't even let you
<br>
&quot;imagine&quot; executing crimes (at least in my interpretation
<br>
of what he proposes); perhaps it is less than that -- you can
<br>
design all world destroying nanobots you want, it simply will
<br>
never manufacture them.  If his vision is closer to the former
<br>
than the later, then that is an operating system in which the
<br>
thought police prevent you from ever even &quot;going there&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, the implementation of the &quot;thought police&quot; is a
<br>
swamp that may lead to stagnation and self-mummyification.
<br>
It also permanently closes off approches to the exploration
<br>
of the phase space of what is &quot;possibly feasible&quot;.  Lots
<br>
of self-conscious humans had to die horrible deaths to get
<br>
us to where we are today.  Make a case that that should
<br>
cease to get us where we might go in the future.
