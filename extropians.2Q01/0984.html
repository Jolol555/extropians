I made some off-the-cuff comments on misery being necessary for evolution
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
J. R. Molloy responded:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You assume that misery will occur. Why? Surely beings smart enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-evolve can figure out how to avoid misery, as another list member has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already indicated.
</em><br>
<p>You can avoid misery if you disconnect key pathways involving in the
<br>
determination that &quot;this life sucks&quot;.  Now that would be an interesting
<br>
simulation where the sim-director receives the feedback that the simulant
<br>
feels the sim sucks, but the sumulant doesn't feel it at all.
<br>
<p>I'd have to argue that this results in a really screwed up sim.  This
<br>
has to rapidly decay into a Monty-Pythonesque sketch --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A:    &quot;O.K. I'll just go on now.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;B.K.: &quot;Come back 'ere and fight you bugger&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A:    &quot;But you've got no arm&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;B.K.: &quot;That! Its nothing but a flesh wound&quot;. etc.
<br>
<p>[I've posted the URL's in a previous msg.]
<br>
<p>You can avoid &quot;misery&quot; but can you avoid &quot;simulated&quot; misery?
<br>
<p>How do you determine what path to take to a higher level if there
<br>
are not, along some paths, some real losers?
<br>
<p>You can tip-toe through the tulips and make sure nobody &quot;dies&quot;
<br>
(heaven forbid) but then the least level of &quot;the world didn't
<br>
turn out the way I wanted&quot; whining becomes the ground zero
<br>
standard for &quot;suffering&quot;.
<br>
<p>STRONG ASSERTION: &quot;Eliminating someone from the game -- e.g.
<br>
painlessly erasing a conscious self-aware being -- is less
<br>
immoral than continuing to run a conscious self-aware being in
<br>
a simulation in which which they *know* they are being given a
<br>
less than equivalent share of the computronium pie.
<br>
<p>In one case you eliminate the suffering in the other you
<br>
prolong it!
<br>
<p>Its looking to me like it becomes immoral to create backup
<br>
copies and *ever* allow them to run.  You can create the
<br>
copies but you can't run them forward in a simulation.
<br>
<p>QED: if you are going to screw up your life by changing
<br>
the dials on your internal prioritization/sensitivity
<br>
network you *must* do it without a parachute.
<br>
<p>Thus we are back to do you value &quot;consciousness&quot;
<br>
or do you value evolution (extropicization)?
<br>
<p>[As Anders has pointed out there is probably room in the
<br>
Universe for both perspectives -- but to maintain that --
<br>
it would seem you have to adopt an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;I do not know&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;I do not want to know&quot;, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;It would be immoral of me to discover that I knew
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&quot;what&quot; you are doing with your computronium).
<br>
perspective.
<br>
<p>Mind you -- if I construct my computronium to run with sufficient
<br>
encryption, it is unlikely that you could discover that I'm
<br>
running a &quot;copies&quot; that bite the dust in reality.  So you can safely
<br>
proceed to use my computational services unless you want to take
<br>
the &quot;moral&quot; high ground that I could not derive the results
<br>
I am able to produce unless I was off'ing copies.  Kind of sounds
<br>
a bit like the debate for/against eating genetically engineered
<br>
foods today.]
