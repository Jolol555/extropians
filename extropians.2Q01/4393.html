<p>
Actually, Star Trek started out to be more accurate than it ended up.
<br>
<p>The original pilot (pre Captain Kirk) included some very Extropian questions
<br>
about virtual reality, whether we are in a simulation or the real world, who
<br>
has the authority to make command decisions over others, molecular transport
<br>
and teleportation, and the investigation of the unknown.  It clearly showed
<br>
an evolution of technology from the long-lost ship, to the current
<br>
Enterprise, to the advanced aliens.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, it was reportedly &quot;too cerebral&quot; for the audience to follow
<br>
(read: network executives), and they directed Gene Roddenberry to dumb it
<br>
down.  They wanted more action and less thinking.  They created a quota of
<br>
fight scenes that had to be met in every episode.  The network executives
<br>
even airbrushed Spock's ears round on the original advertising posters,
<br>
because pointed ears were just too transhuman for their comfort levels.
<br>
They also rejected the original color of Spock which was going to be red.
<br>
They thought red and pointed ears would look too satanic.  They really
<br>
changed his make-up color so as not to offend religious viewers.
<br>
<p>The original pilot also included a woman (gasp!) in a command position.
<br>
Roddenberry was told to remove the female and have only male leaders.  He
<br>
cut out Majel and snuck her back in with a blond wig as nurse Chapel, a
<br>
&quot;female&quot; role.  He then migrated all the non-testosterone tendencies from
<br>
the female advisor to the alien Mr. Spock.  This later evolved into the
<br>
Vulcan logic which is now famous.  This originally was female creativity
<br>
versus male aggression.
<br>
<p>The series also had a lot of background which was cut out after the original
<br>
runs to make more room for commercials.  Most people don't realize that
<br>
there were many trips from the bridge to the transporter room where the
<br>
landing party discussed the merits of the mission and debated tactics and
<br>
policy.  Most people never have scene the background maintenance workers who
<br>
had jumpsuit-style uniforms and provided background people during these
<br>
throw-away scenes.  There are many interesting discussions between Spock and
<br>
McCoy about the merits of vegetarianism or the value of aggression.  I
<br>
believe that Roddenberry tried to sneak in a lot more thought into the
<br>
series between the action scenes, but most of these were cut out.
<br>
<p>Roddenberry even tried to develop a more accurate flight sequences, but they
<br>
were scrapped.  His original effects lit up the Enterprise only on one side,
<br>
but it looked like half the ship was missing to the uninitiated.  He had the
<br>
space ship zoom past the camera in the title sequences without a hint of
<br>
noise, because space is quiet.  But everyone asked where was the sound.
<br>
They reluctantly added the whoosh effect by popular demand, even against
<br>
their better judgment.  They knew that the ship might fly with the floor
<br>
down toward the planet, but in the equator orbit scenes this would look like
<br>
the ship was sideways.  They knew that phasors should shoot at the speed of
<br>
light, but it would make it difficult to follow the direction of the firing.
<br>
They knew that lasers wouldn't explode or instantly disintegrate objects, so
<br>
they invented &quot;phasors&quot; that could have more dramatic side-effects.
<br>
<p>In short, entertainment audiences demand action over reality.  When
<br>
reality-based presentations are attempted, people complain and producers are
<br>
forced to jazz things up.  Even &quot;Survivor&quot; discovered that they had to redo
<br>
or fake some scenes, because even people tuning in to see reality just
<br>
wouldn't accept the lack of presentational style of live reality.  I don't
<br>
think modern entertainment is ignorant of science, but are more interested
<br>
in entertainment over science.
