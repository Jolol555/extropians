<p>I think the first thing to do is to find your motivation, those values and 
<br>
goals that make you go out and do something. If you have an idea of what you 
<br>
want to do with your life or what kind of person you want to be, then the 
<br>
rest is a solvable problem.
<br>
<p>What I once did was to list all the stuff I wanted to do, and see both what 
<br>
it had in common - that ought to be a top priority - and what I would need to 
<br>
achieve it. For example, since I wanted to design a starship (I was rather 
<br>
young when I did this) I realised I needed to know math do it. So learning 
<br>
math was important, and I began to read some books on it in the library. The 
<br>
same for a lot of other areas, including of course how to get better at 
<br>
learning.
<br>
<p>Once you have motivation and a base to build from, you can really get started 
<br>
with the fun stuff. You will need to develop your critical thinking so that 
<br>
you can use your brainpower for constructive things, you will refine your 
<br>
motivation and ideas and gradually develop your life into a creative artwork.
