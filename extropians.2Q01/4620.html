<p>Well, it's as close to a seeing an event horizont as it gets (actually,
<br>
you see it by not seeing it, as the hot matter nugget in question not
<br>
only does the Doppler dance, but passes behind the event horizont,
<br>
which of course intercepts the radiation (I must go reread that article,
<br>
the numbers are not exact, but ballpark).

<p>Oh, it's goddamn cool because instrumentation and signal processing has been
<br>
becoming so good, even if though our instruments are still mired on
<br>
the dirtball. What an array of spaceborn instruments could see in a
<br>
few decades is going to be a lot better.
<br>
<p>The actual point I was making that I cited three random items from a single
<br>
publication, or a couple of them. If you see them ramping up over the 
<br>
years, and so matter-of-factly. The results are important for themselves,
<br>
but even more important is the trend.
<br>
<p>I would like to see the faces of a few distinguished looking people, if 
<br>
I gave them any such particular issue, say, in 1980. Anyone still remembers
<br>
how it was in 1980? It's not as bad as 1950, or something, but it's getting
<br>
there.
