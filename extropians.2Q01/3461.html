<em>&gt; &gt; This sort of thing serves as a reminder that what we take as obvious, the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; It is also a sign that we need to make more inroads in mainstream

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Amen to that.  But before they can &quot;integrate it with an ethical
<br>
discourse&quot; we need to do so ourselves.  We don't speak often enough
<br>
about the ethics of what we propose or about its implications and how we
<br>
get from here to there. Without that, it is not surprising that others
<br>
have no context or pick up the context of those more fearful of the
<br>
technologies.  Fear of change is far more wired-in and easy to invoke
<br>
than a positive vision of the future and how to get there and what
<br>
difference it makes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The exit strategy doesn't work. Where are all the top notch researchers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many great researchers can you attract with promises of freedom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they might get prosecuted if they return home, when investors dare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not invest because they will be tainted in the media by association with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;evil&quot; and possibly even get hit by bills forbidding investing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unethical overseas research? Sure, you will likely get some heroes, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the modern scientific/technological enterprise does not work that way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To get somewhere, we need a lively open scientific discourse, competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labs, investors and the economic power of being part of the global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think the exit strategy can work.  It has certainly worked at many
<br>
points in history.  I don't believe that today is so utterly different
<br>
as to make it totally unworkable.  Why not have the researchers and the
<br>
investors and everyone else concerned all move to where they are freest
<br>
to pursue their dreams?  Let those who cannot or will not follow stay
<br>
home in the world they vote into existence if it is incompatible with
<br>
the creation of the future.  
<br>
<p>There is a dilemna here.  On the one hand freedom from government
<br>
shackles and freedom from the will of the uninformed and partially
<br>
uneducable masses is essential to progress with the work.  On the other
<br>
hand the work utterly transforms the lives of everyone.  To what extent
<br>
do we have the right and even the obligation to choose for humanity? 
<br>
This is truly a bothersome question.  The flip-side of that is to what
<br>
extent does humanity have the right to limit the future to what some
<br>
reasonable quorom (if there is such) decides?  To what extent are we
<br>
rogue outlaws assuming rights over all that we are not granted if we go
<br>
against these wishes?  Do we freely own this label?  If we do then can
<br>
we act suprised when some of the powers that be decide to treat us as
<br>
rogues rather than as heroes? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The way to fight this is to deal with the underlying memes that make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people make this kind of silly decision. We need to show why our pet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects are not just beneficial but ethical, and why banning them would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be both impractical and immoral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That may be an easy case to make in certain lines of genetic research. 
<br>
It is a harder case when pitching an SI or full NT.  There are enough
<br>
unknowns of catastrophic proportions to give anyone pause.  There needs
<br>
to be a large enough vision of what this will do for everyone, not just
<br>
the few, and of what worse possibilities this heads off, that the risks
<br>
appear worth taking.   
<br>
<p>Along the way, looking for a country where more freedom can be had if it
<br>
turns out to be necessary is a good backup plan.
