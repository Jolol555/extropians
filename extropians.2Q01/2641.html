<em>&gt; You must remember that he was not in control of the films,
</em><br>
<p>So Ive been told, regarding the ER debacle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to characters, I thought Ian was very cool. Very very cool, okay?
</em><br>
<p>Ian was my favorite too, but do rent a movie that really does
<br>
a terrific job at developing *real* human characters: As Good
<br>
As It Gets.  Now, this might be out of your genre, for it is not
<br>
sci-fi at all, but do make an exception for this shining jewel of
<br>
a film.  Note especially the skilled character development by
<br>
the three leads, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear,
<br>
who form the odd trio.
<br>
<p>Consider especially one scene which *defines* the actor's task of
<br>
good character development.  Hunt's character (Carol) has been
<br>
bitchy to Jack's character (Udall, who richly deserved the poor
<br>
treatment).  Udall arranges to get a doctor to heal Carol's child,
<br>
the most precious thing in her life.  Jack honestly expects
<br>
*nothing* in return, he just wants Carol to do her job (a waitress).
<br>
All he wants is for her to bring his breakfast, thats all!  Carol
<br>
pens a 30 page letter expressing her gratitude and apology, etc.
<br>
Jack hates people, hates emotion, doesnt want anything like this.
<br>
<p>Note the scene in the restaurant where Carol is pouring
<br>
herself on the floor for this wretch, and he honestly cannot handle
<br>
the emotional display.  Udall loves this young woman, but he
<br>
just isnt ready for a normal human relationship.  That scene
<br>
describes life as it is, or humanity as I know it.  People are a
<br>
curious bag of intellect and emotion,  interacting with each other
<br>
in strange and wonderful ways.  Both Nicholson and Hunt won
<br>
academy awards for that performance.
<br>
<p>Sci-fi has nothing really analogous to this in character
<br>
development.  The closest I can think of is Jodie Foster
<br>
in Contact, who does a fine job, but the slightly flawed
<br>
story cannot contain her soaring talent.
<br>
<p>What say ye?  spike
