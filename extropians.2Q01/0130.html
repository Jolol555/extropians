<p>Eugene, isn't that a bit harsh?  Please remember that they were born with almost
<br>
no money in their mouths.  They do not consider their mission to be the design and
<br>
construction of the world's most reliable distributed computing system.  They just
<br>
want to process their data, and have found a cheep way to do so through the
<br>
volunteers.  They got up to a GB a day before the crash, which is nothing to look
<br>
down your nose at.
<br>
<p>The sys admin for SETI is a friend of mine, and I had a chance to ask him about
<br>
the situation yesterday.  He told me that thieves went after about $10k of copper
<br>
cables, and in the process of ripping them off, messed up the fiber that SETI
<br>
uses.  He would agree with you, in that they do not have what they would like to
<br>
have by way of true distribution.  He said that they are all quite concerned about
<br>
what is going to happen when they try to turn the system back on, and those couple
<br>
of million clients try to log in at once.
