<em>&gt; I see your point, but you are overstating the case to an almost ludicrous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree.
</em><br>
<p>Probably.  My point was that we can't predict everything accurately.  I
<br>
agree that for most cases, there is no need to.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm responsible for debugging and maintaining one corner
<br>
<em>&gt; of an enormously complex ERP system with thousands of users.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've seen all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations you mention (though I've never seen anything that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately blamed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sunspots!)
</em><br>
<p>I have seen satellites knocked out by solar flares and sunspot activity, due
<br>
to the interference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; , and all that stuff has to be sorted through and ruled out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systematically when there's a problem.  That's what programmers and system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administrators and database administrators and network administrators and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware techs get paid the big bucks for.  Generally, one **doesn't** get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away with claiming a bug is not reproducible
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I agree totally.  One has to prove that the blame is accurate or else
<br>
it's just a guess.  True debugging is ruling out possibilities and narrowing
<br>
in until the exact cause is found.  Just trying things until something works
<br>
is the brute-force approach of an unskilled debugger.
<br>
<p>I certainly didn't mean to imply that bugs could not be debugged after the
<br>
fact.  I was objecting from the opposite direction.  I was trying to say
<br>
that it is impossible to predict computers well enough to eliminate
<br>
unforeseen bugs.  (At least we haven't been able to do it yet.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One sine qua non of doing computer programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a living (never mind being a brilliant one -- just being able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job at all!) is to absolutely (and I mean to the marrow of your bones)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get out of the habit of blaming ghosts in the machine.  You have to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really, really firm grip on the probabilities --
</em><br>
<p>I agree totally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the probability that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something was caused by sunspots, or some random, irreproducible glitch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is always next to nothing
</em><br>
<p>Depends on your field.  I have debugged radiation-induced communications
<br>
failures in satellites.  Sunspots and solar flares definitely will change
<br>
transmission throughput characteristics.  A system that requires 99% of
<br>
available bandwidth throughput is not robust enough to operate during high
<br>
sunspot activities in space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You betcher bank account balance computers are predictable!
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, no.  I have extensive experience programming bank computers.  The
<br>
methods for handling fractional pennies on interest or fees varies widely
<br>
between banks.  Direct deposits are not predictable by time and are
<br>
routinely done up to 24 hours in advance just to make sure.  Transmission
<br>
lines are often down, so updates sometimes don't occur when they should.
<br>
Most banks hold funds deposited after a certain time until the next day.
<br>
Unfortunately, the ATM clock is not usually exactly synchronized with the
<br>
bank's internal computer.  Deposit something a few seconds before the
<br>
deadline, and you have no way of knowing when it will be credited to your
<br>
account.  You never know if checks through the mail have been processed or
<br>
not.  The balance shown on your ATM may or may not include deposit checks
<br>
with holds on them that are not yet &quot;available&quot;.  I have run into many such
<br>
timing errors where bank computers cannot absolutely confirm that money is
<br>
or is not in an account at any specific moment.  Banks have staff members
<br>
routinely correcting accounts each month due to minor timing errors that the
<br>
customers complain about.
<br>
<p>I know this may sound unreasonable, but if you actually get into writing
<br>
low-level device drivers or actually write code to handle bank systems, you
<br>
find that things are never as clear cut as they seem at first.  I am not
<br>
arguing just to be stubborn.  I actually have seen these kinds of errors
<br>
while developing, testing and debugging bank systems.  The more I debug
<br>
computers, the more I am convinced that they are not perfectly predictable.
<br>
This is not due to vaguely blaming the ghost in the machine.  I actually get
<br>
traces or resolve the history and determine that things happen differently
<br>
in different rare circumstances that were unforeseen by the programmer.
<br>
Software is rarely robust enough to recover completely transparently.  Even
<br>
the best software can't undo previous history that has already occurred but
<br>
shouldn't have.
