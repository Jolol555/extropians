When you mention the Eternal Return, I reach for my phaser!  Neitszche is 
<br>
cool, but I suspect that if he is correct, then the information is useless. 
<br>
It becomes, what Philosopher, John Leslie, calls &quot;value death'. Back to 
<br>
survival, in a longer mode; we need to see if we or they (AI) can produce 
<br>
digital analogs of the mammal brain, or see if synthesized brain/minds are 
<br>
similar to us. If they get bored, in either case, then we will have to face 
<br>
up to the eternity of boredom, and its resolution. Sometimes taking long naps 
<br>
seems to help resolve boredom, though not depression. Can AI SI's become 
<br>
depressed? 
<br>
<p>I am taking a psychologically, linear, view, and with all due respect to 
<br>
Master Neitszche, I am supposing that this universe that we have so far 
<br>
detected is linear (or helical as Ben Goertzel suggests) and that we, as a 
<br>
species, live in a cosmos that is 'merely' 12-15 Giga years old. Taking that 
<br>
view &quot;we&quot; have not been down this road before. Or if we have, we have no 
<br>
recollection, therefore its utterly, unimportant.
<br>
If we find a mass storage, place that indicates that Neitszche was correct, 
<br>
then we have to ask, &quot;Is they, us?&quot;  If they is merely replicas, lets do 
<br>
something fun! Then lets take a nap. Beats the crap out of mopping floors, or 
<br>
cutting cane.

<p>&lt;&lt; Life means to find out, and having found it all out, life forebears further

&nbsp;entanglements. Then no greater brain need emerge, which explains why no

&nbsp;greater brain *has* emerged.

&nbsp;Fermi's paradox is not a paradox at all. Explanation: Intelligence matures to
<br>
&nbsp;the point where it understands Eternal Recurrence, and then it discerns the

&nbsp;futility of further evolution. The crown of creation has figured out that
<br>
&nbsp;we're all going to the same place, namely, nowhere (now-here).
