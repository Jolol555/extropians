<p>&lt;&lt; I'm afraid this is how I see most of our predictions.  After watching the
<br>
&nbsp;moon landings, I regularly saw predictions of Moon bases by 1980, Mars bases
<br>
&nbsp;by 1990, flying cars in the year 2000. AI such as HAL was predicted to be
<br>
&nbsp;this year, as well as a manned mission to Jupiter.  I really thought I would
<br>
&nbsp;live to visit other planets, but now that hope seems unlikely unless a major
<br>
&nbsp;breakthrough in life-extension allows me to go farther into the future. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Visiting other planets ought to depend on propulsions and life-support 
<br>
technology alone and have nothing to do with life-extention; baring travel 
<br>
out past Jupiter. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Predications such as these are routinely overoptimistic.  Although
<br>
technology is advancing at a phenomenal rate, most people underestimate the
<br>
inertia of most human's desires that things remain the same.  Our biggest
<br>
threat is not the inability of technology to progress, but the antagonism
<br>
most people feel toward technology.  Most people actively oppose all this
<br>
neat stuff we are talking about.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Technology, aside from computer technology, is advancing, but not at a 
<br>
phenomenal rate. The problem is not &quot;people's inertia&quot; it is every science 
<br>
research institution, and  business research center claiming &quot;breakthrough's&quot; 
<br>
at every research development. This is their means to pimp for more research 
<br>
money. But not every new discovery is useful, not every new experiment seems 
<br>
to get us where we wish to go. 
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;Look at what happened to the space program once people decided that we
<br>
didn't want a space race anymore.  Expect the same apathy toward other
<br>
technologies.  How fast can progress occur in a capitalist system if nobody
<br>
wants it?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It comes down to this. Companies and inventors and university research center 
<br>
pimp their discoveries, their inventions, their research. Lets look at costs. 
<br>
Why are Fuel Cells so expensive? Why is always 20 years till nuclear fusion, 
<br>
why is it always 10 years till solar break through?  
<br>
<p>It either works or it doesn't, it's either marketable or its not. Its not the 
<br>
public, its the researchers and the companies and institutions that suck, not 
<br>
the public. Let them come, not with promises, but with working products that 
<br>
people can afford. Give people choices, don't scrounge money, give us 
<br>
products that are buyable. 
<br>
<p>Harvey, the problem lies not in the stars, or ourselves, but in the minds and 
<br>
egos of technological researchers and the people that employ them.
