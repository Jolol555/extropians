<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;... simply moderate giftedness has been made worthless by the printing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; press and radio and television and satellites and all that. A moderately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gifted person who would have been a community treasure a thousand years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago has to give up, has to go into some other line of work, since modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications put him or her into daily competition with nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's champions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The entire planet can get along nicely now with maybe a dozen champion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performers in each area of human giftedness. A moderately gifted person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to keep his or her gifts all bottled up until, in a manner of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking, he or she gets drunk at a wedding and tapdances on the coffee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table like Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers. We have a name for him or her.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We call him or her an 'exhibitionist.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do we reward such an exhibitionist? We say to him or her the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning, 'Wow! were you ever drunk last night!'&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         -- Kurt Vonnegut, &quot;Bluebeard&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Wow, does this touch a nerve!
<br>
<p>I remember dancing around this theme a few weeks ago
<br>
( <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/0242.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/0242.html</a> )
<br>
when I wrote [but didn't Vonnegut express it immeasurably
<br>
more vividly and succinctly, nicely illustrating the point!]:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The brightest person I know, who is now in the first half of his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seventh decade, has, since long before I got to know him 25 years ago, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held the opinion that industrialized entertainment (in particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movies, TV, and the recorded music business) is nothing less than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a legalized form of drug pushing, like the cigarette industry. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets people hooked on its product at an early age, robs them of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity to produce their own entertainments (because its high-gloss 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professionalism, like the taste of refined sugar compared to that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a piece of fruit, cannot compete with the cruder product), siphons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money from its users all their lives, and ultimately rots their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains. 
</em><br>
<p>The Vonnegut quote illustrates that there's more to this phenomenon than
<br>
the machinations of the entertainment industry; there's a sharpening
<br>
of hierarchy in all human endeavors inherent in the technological
<br>
advancement of human communication itself (including, now, the
<br>
Internet).
<br>
<p>A friend of mine who read my post mentioned to me afterward that he has
<br>
recently been struggling with the realization that the fact that he has
<br>
become an expert consumer of media is probably responsible for 
<br>
his own creativity having been mostly blocked throughout his life despite
<br>
a stab at filmmaking early on and a continuing interest in photography.
<br>
<p>Almost the same day I heard this from my friend, I saw a movie from
<br>
last year:  _High Fidelity_, about a (vinyl) record shop run by a trio
<br>
of popular music enthusiasts with considerable intelligence and
<br>
encyclopedic knowledge of their field, but who nevertheless yearn in
<br>
their hearts to be producers instead of merely consumers.  They respond
<br>
to every situation and event in their lives by concocting a &quot;top five&quot;
<br>
song list or compilation tape as the perfect metaphor (just as I lace most
<br>
of my posts to this list with quotes from _Star Trek_ or Bertrand
<br>
Russell).  It's an extremely funny movie, but again, it cuts
<br>
awfully close to the bone!
<br>
<p>I myself am nothing if not &quot;moderately gifted&quot; (with emphasis on the
<br>
&quot;moderately&quot;), and decades ago I accepted my role in life as a
<br>
middle-class consumer.  As I wrote in a recent e-mail:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The people who write the books I read or who compose and perform the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music on the CD's I buy aren't real, you know -- it all just comes out of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factory somewhere, and human beings are only consumers, like me! ;-&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aldous Huxley had it perfectly right, I think -- we're all Alphas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Betas, and Gammas [Deltas and Epsilons are even lower in the hierarchy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than me, so naturally I don't see them!].  I'm a Gamma who watches Alphas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Betas on TV for entertainment (they're not real, either), and there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are always doormen and security guards in the real world... to make sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we Gammas don't bother the grownups, but we can hang out in the bookstores
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and record stores to our hearts' content.
</em><br>
<p>I wrote the above in conjunction with an expression of doubt that
<br>
I have any business being on the Extropians' mailing list (which you
<br>
might have trouble believing from the volume of my posts over the
<br>
past couple of months, but it's true -- I usually wonder every time
<br>
I hit the &quot;Send&quot; button what the **hell** I think I'm doing here!).
<br>
My insecurity is abetted by the whiff of elitism -- the Ayn Randian
<br>
strain of the Extropians (I have cordially hated Ayn Rand for a long time,
<br>
though I haven't read any of her books [I've seen the movie of _The
<br>
Fountainhead_ with Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal, of course(*)], mostly
<br>
as the result of a personal relationship many years ago with an
<br>
Ayn Rand enthusiast which doesn't bear examination in a public forum ;-&gt; ).
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, despite _Atlas Shrugged_ (which I gather alludes to the
<br>
theme that the world is run by a few really competent people, and the
<br>
rest of us are just along for the ride), it has been my own observation
<br>
that there's a **vast** pool of untapped talent in the world, far more
<br>
than can squeeze into the top of any social pyramid, and that the
<br>
feedback that that the top .0001% exert on the other 99.9999% suppresses
<br>
that potential **until** there's a need for one of the .0002 percenters
<br>
to step forward.  And so on down the line.
<br>
<p>I've even seen this in **myself**!  I was in a meeting at work a few
<br>
years ago at which nobody seemed to be taking the lead and asking
<br>
the pertinent questions, and after listening to this for a few minutes,
<br>
I got up, went to the whiteboard, and took charge (without being
<br>
asked, a **most** uncharacteristic thing for me to do).  Afterwards,
<br>
the manager who had nominally been running the meeting came up, **thanked**
<br>
me for taking over, and added something along the lines of &quot;I didn't
<br>
think you had it in you&quot;, to which I replied (to myself, at least), well, I
<br>
don't usually **have** to, but **somebody** had to do it this time!
<br>
And it changes your head to be involved in a situation like that --
<br>
alters the wash of neurotransmitters, heightens the testosterone, ramps
<br>
up the neuromodulators, and burnishes up the synapses!  Gives a Gamma
<br>
a taste of what it would be like to be a Beta or even an Alpha
<br>
[I'm reminded also of those intelligent birds -- the Gubru? -- in
<br>
one of Brin's latest Uplift books, who change color and sex depending
<br>
on the outcome of a dominance struggle].
<br>
<p>I think talented people are a bit like shark's teeth -- there are always
<br>
more of them waiting in the wings to take over when the ones
<br>
at the front fall out.
<br>
<p>But what does this communication feedback effect portend for life
<br>
after the Singularity, I wonder?  Of course, we could all become
<br>
solitary creatures and scatter as quickly as possible as far away from
<br>
each other as possible (which would be a radical change from
<br>
life as we know it -- language-based human intelligence itself, after
<br>
all, evolved as primarily a **social** tool).  Or, we could become
<br>
Borganized, mere processing nodes in some corporate intelligence (remember
<br>
Dan Simmmons' _Hyperion_ books, in which it turned out that the AIs
<br>
[the TechnoCore] were actually using human brains as processors without the
<br>
humans even knowing it, though to do so they had to keep them near
<br>
matter-transmitting portals, which they did by building multi-world-spanning
<br>
shopping malls? ;-&gt; ;-&gt; ;-&gt; ).  Or, we could end up even more
<br>
complexly insignificant, as I gather most of the inhabitants of
<br>
Iain Banks' Culture are supposed to be (or maybe even most of the
<br>
polis inhabitants in Egan's _Diaspora_).
<br>
<p>Sigh.

<br>
greatness in others?  Probably so.  YUCK!
