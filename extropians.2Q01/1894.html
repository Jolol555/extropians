<p>While I agree that there are no ghosts in the machine I absolutely
<br>
disagree that you can always, in finite time, reproduce any bug that
<br>
anyone has ever encountered in using a particular batch of code.  There
<br>
are simply too many possible variables.  Now, it is possible to build in
<br>
enough checking to catch most really anomalous situations more or less
<br>
gracefully.  But even this is not necessarily sufficient as bugs
<br>
sometimes are in the subtle interaction of quite a number of components
<br>
all of which perfectly meet their contract as specified.  Even properly
<br>
stating some of the interactions between components (especially in the
<br>
presence of callbacks) is not a very thoroughly mastered or even
<br>
altogether tractable task. 
<br>
<p>That computers are predictable no more means that you can predict in
<br>
practice everything they will ever do than in practice you can
<br>
successfully predict everything that will occur in nature even with a
<br>
TOE.  The problem is just not computationally tractable beyond a certain
<br>
point.  
<br>
<p>Determinism != Full Predictability in practice.
