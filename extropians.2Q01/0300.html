<em>&gt;Subject: SOC: The Challenge of &quot;The Second World&quot; (Was: Argentina economy)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Working to understand and change the things that have caused this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;static condition is just as or perhaps more important than working to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;introduce new technologies into such societies and improving the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions of material life.  What is it that societies as disparate as
</em><br>
those
<br>
<em>&gt;we find in Colombia, Nigeria and Burma have in common that has held them
</em><br>
back
<br>
<em>&gt;from the benefits of real modernism?  Why have attempts to aid development
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt;these countries proved so ineffective for so long?  Looking at places where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modernism has had a false start seems to me to be as important as studying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those where it has been most successful.
</em><br>
<p>I cannot but agree fully with this attitude. In fact, the main reason I
<br>
joined
<br>
the list (lurking mostly, but having quite often a very interesting reading)
<br>
is
<br>
seeing if people here had any fresh ideas and approaches to this chronical
<br>
stagnation. As my previous lengthy message probably made it clear, in
<br>
countries
<br>
like mine we have come to the point in which keeping the basic things going
<br>
on
<br>
is already a huge victory, and a fight that consumes all of your time and
<br>
energy. The prospects of social collapse are just there over the horizon,
<br>
and it
<br>
takes all your efforts just to keep disaster at bay.
<br>
<p>As for the causes of this stagnation in countries like mine, I'd like to
<br>
offer
<br>
this list of (again, deriving from my personal and subjective experience)
<br>
the
<br>
most apperent causes:
<br>
- generalized corruption: I'm talking about the billions-of-dollars size
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;corruption here. Government officials receiving bribes, government
<br>
contracts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;awarded to mediocre and unscrupled businessmen, budget funding being
<br>
diverted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;towards &quot;thank you&quot; projects and black hole funds. Money laundry, drugs
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;weapon trafficking, and favoritism/selling of services have been the daily
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;way of our governments since I was born. Mafias are/were being run from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;provincial government and federal department positions as a matter of fact
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thing.
<br>
- incompetence: people in positions of decision/power simply lack the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ability and background to understand the problems we have. This is due to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;plain ignorance, ideological blindness, or gross mismanagement ideas
<br>
deeply
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rooted in a tradition of bureocracy.
<br>
- endemic violence: corruption and incompetence both foster violent answers
<br>
to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;situations of conflict in an already much stressed social environment.
<br>
This
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;goes both for the lower-classes individual (many times forced to literally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;steal for a living and food) to the mafias that prosper in association
<br>
with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the corrupt governments, to the ideologicized security/army forces (still
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;deeply stuck into the fascist killer-squad and anti-communist
<br>
concentration
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;camp mentalities). People trying to change things in a too loudy voice,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or denouncing the miserable spoiling of the governing mafias have quite
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;often found a grim end in a highway ditch, shot on the head by a police
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;officer on the pay roll of some politician or businessman.
<br>
- inefficient and malicious foreign influence: IMF policies have stagnated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;our economical development for decades now, simply because their dogmatic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;views on &quot;efficient&quot; administration are inadequate and purely short-term.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;National debt interests are so high and demanding on the already weak
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;economy, governments can rarely do much but paying interests and doing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;basic upkeep and wages. Given the corruption and the mafias, we tend to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;attract dirty capitals, foreing monopolists, and simply criminal
<br>
businessmen,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all eager to keep the status quo and abort any changing efforts.
<br>
- cultural/educational failure: my previous mail went pretty much over this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subject. I will only add that governments and businessmen give a flying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cow about the population's culture and formation. Public libraries, local
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;folk culture, writers, musicians and philosophers are mainly ignored. When
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;actually supported, it is just for a quick buck and soon forgotten again.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since most people lack the money to indulge in any kind of cultural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuit, ignorance and the most base entertainments are the only kind
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of &quot;cultural life&quot; around for the big part of the population.
<br>
- ideological prejudice: there is a sad tendency to see all in terms of old
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and very restrictive ideological categories. The traditional '60s &quot;Third
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;World revolutionary discourse&quot; is much present in labor unions, artists,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophers and segments of the middle social classes that resent all the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recent &quot;liberalization&quot; of the economy. On the other hand, the upper
<br>
classes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;seem stuck into right-wing, catholic, conservative, europhile/USAphile
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;attitudes, with a deep despisement of anything national, the conviction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that our common people are inherently flawed and irrecoverable, and a
<br>
blind
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;faith in &quot;liberalism&quot;, the markets, and the agro-exporting role for the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;country.
<br>
- lack of infrastructure: communications, transport and distribution systems
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are old, ridiculously insufficient, and collapsing. The government can't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;support them, the businessmen aren't interested in financing them unless
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they get a monopoly on fares and tolls, and for the most part both workers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and small businessmen are just trying to survive on the agro-exporting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sector to try to do something about it by themselves. Technology is in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hands of monopolistic businessmen, and its cost is usually too high for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the average person.
<br>
<p>If someone can see deeper and hidden (to my perhaps lacking vision) patterns
<br>
and causes behind all this mess, I'd be much eager to read about it. Control
<br>
of information and its spreading to the population is something the ruling
<br>
elites in my country are very careful to keep to themselves, so we many
<br>
times
<br>
lack the most basic facts and perspectives about said general patterns.
<br>
Which
<br>
only helps perpetuate the stagnation, of course...
<br>
