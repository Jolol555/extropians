Brent Allsop asked, in effect, &quot;How do you respond to an atheist
<br>
who points out a similarity between believing that cryonics might
<br>
work (it's a better chance than nothing) and believing in Pascal's
<br>
wager (you have everything to win if He does exist, but nothing
<br>
to lose if He does not)?&quot;
<br>
<p>The two cases aren't parallel, I would say.  In the first place,
<br>
Pascal asks for one to be intellectually dishonest, or to achieve
<br>
double-think.  If you don't believe that there is a God, then how
<br>
can you, by an act of will, change that and come to believe?  Let
<br>
me illustrate:  Suppose you heard a knock on your door, and someone 
<br>
appeared who would really give you a million dollars on one tiny
<br>
condition.  All you have to do is believe that your computer is
<br>
an elephant.  Could you do it?  Not unless you are a lot better
<br>
at double-think than I am.  If I really, really needed the money,
<br>
then I might try very hard, but I don't think that I could
<br>
honestly tell him that I believed it.
<br>
<p>To get signed up for cryonics, on the other hand, all you have to
<br>
do is to believe that it **may** work.  This you either already
<br>
do, or you already don't.  No meta-argument about what you should
<br>
believe can change that.  What might change that is getting more
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>I also think that there are other formal differences between
<br>
Pascal's wager and belief that cryonics may work.  But they're
<br>
less striking and less important.
