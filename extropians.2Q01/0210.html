</em><br>
<p>*No*, Damien.  That's knowledge which, as a member of an immature species,
<br>
I have absolutely no way of having.
<br>
<p>Rather, I make the equation:
<br>
<p>RELIGIOUS CLAIM = FALSIFIABLE CLAIM
<br>
<p>This holds true for 99%+ of all known religious claims prior to, say, 1492
<br>
AD.
<br>
<p>The idea of nonfalsifiable faith is a strictly modern invention, driven by
<br>
theology's loss of confidence.  Ergo, to say that any of the major current
<br>
religions (you know, the ones whose Books were written before 1492) make
<br>
nonfalsifiable claims is to accept the academically fashionable in
<br>
defiance of theological history.
<br>
<p>Making unfalsifiable claims is hard work, Damien.  It takes a theologian
<br>
trained in the concepts of science to invent claims that science can't
<br>
test.  If a normal human just makes stuff up, he'll make up falsifiable
<br>
stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science tell us who killed JFK? Is it competent to tell us if Moses or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jesus even lived? No.
</em><br>
<p>Of course it can.  It just hasn't done so yet.  Whether certain historical
<br>
facts can be permanently lost (i.e., the exact height in millimeters of
<br>
the True Cross) is again something that my species is too young to know
<br>
about, but big honkin' gross facts like the existence or nonexistence of a
<br>
persona that left tracks all over history?  This is almost certainly
<br>
knowable.  We might need to wait until Afterwards, but those who retain
<br>
interest can probably expect a definite answer with 99.99% confidence.
<br>
<p>Likewise, just as a complete examination of all extant genomes would
<br>
probably be enough for an SI to reconstruct the branching of a
<br>
long-vanished evolutionary tree, so too it should be possible to examine
<br>
all extant accounts and determine whether reports of miracles, however
<br>
distorted and changed by the passage of time, originated in an observation
<br>
or a fictional invention.
<br>
<p>And whether pre-1492 religions are true or false is *certainly* knowable.
