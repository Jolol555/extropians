</em><br>
<p>Actually, I did think of that one.  Standard rocket equation:
<br>
Mi/Mf = e^(dV/Ve)
<br>
where:
<br>
Mi = Initial mass
<br>
Mf = Final mass (Mi - fuel used)
<br>
dV = delta velocity (~9000 m/s, for low Earth orbit)
<br>
Ve = exhaust velocity
<br>
...and it's that last term that's critical here.  Chemical rockets can
<br>
get up to 4500 m/s exhaust velocity (at least, the shuttle's liquid
<br>
fuel does), and there doesn't seem to be much improvement possible.
<br>
Much much higher exhaust velocity == much much lower Mi/Mf, to provide
<br>
room for the mass which is your energy source.  If the source is light
<br>
enough, this also means extra payload (or less Mi for a given payload
<br>
mass, et cetera).  Railguns with projectile velocities well over 4500
<br>
m/s (for example, around 20000 m/s) have been demonstrated.
<br>
<p>Can anyone see any other problems?
