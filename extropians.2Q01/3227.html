<p>Does it? I don't remember Anders talking about comprehensive nanotech,

whatever that means.

<p>Even if you can do accurate mechanosynthesis on 100 kg scale, it doesn't
<br>
mean you can do it in vivo. In fact the only way I see viable
<br>
mechanosynthetic manipulation of biological tissue, is around absolute
<br>
zero. Frozen rock solid is not exactly in vivo, and opens a major can of
<br>
worms on its own (you have to insert/retract fractal heat exchanger
<br>
infrastructure, and the thermal descend/ascend is rather damaging even
<br>
with cryoprotectants).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which endlessly repair themselves (or are endlessly repaired by

</em><br>
<p>It's nanites. You can't have atomic-precision repair in vivo, with the
<br>
possible exception of DNA. It would be easier to operate on molecular
<br>
units (exchanging a protein, or a few lipids gone sour), imported from
<br>
compartments, or a transport network into the body from external sources.
<br>
Also remember that these nanorobot things are rather large themselves
<br>
(cubic micron or so) and have an energetic metabolism of their own.
<br>
They're not interactionless ghosts, think rather large bricks plowing
<br>
through the tissue.
<br>
<p>Medical nanotechnology is much, much harder than just machine phase
<br>
nanotechnology (which in itself is harder than self-assembly
<br>
nanotechnology, which we're going to get first, anyway, despite the
<br>
wonderful progress in graphene manipulation). Paradoxically, it is
<br>
probably easier to scan you in a single batch, and rebuild you as a
<br>
computational model. You can even do it with molecular crystal
<br>
self-assembly computronium and MEMS for the scanning stage. There will be
<br>
a race between ALife AI and humans anyway, so it would seem risky to
<br>
remain a flesh puppet for too long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Problem areas: Changes we do not understand the purpose of. Instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resetting those age-related changes (within the brain, for example)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Making a backup copy beforehand, however, should obviate even this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem and permit experimentation.
</em><br>
<p>Making a backup copy is much easier if you're an information pattern
<br>
already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All other paths are stopgaps on the road to nanotech--which obsoletes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all technologies. If cyborging occurs at that point, it will be
</em><br>
<p>Rather the opposite: nano is a big enabler of existing tech, and
<br>
facilitates creation of new ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; accomplished by means of nt, and done to convey advantages

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
