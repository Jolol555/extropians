<p>
4-5 years ago, when the list was in another period of angst about its own
<br>
quality, I noted that there were people whose posts I almost always enjoyed
<br>
reading, and then there were all the others (sometimes good posts, sometimes
<br>
flaming; good posts on topics I didn't care about; down to /dev/null bait.)  
<br>
<p>Feeling overwhelmed by volume, I had procmail put mail from the first group
<br>
into a separate mailbox from the rest of the list, and took to reading that,
<br>
occasionally dipping into the main mailbox.
<br>
<p>Then, at Robin's suggestion, I offered to send a digest of that filtered
<br>
mailbox to people, and some people liked it, and apparently still do.  So I
<br>
offer it again.  
<br>
<p>I do not claim to be offering an objective take on the cream of the list,
<br>
merely posts from the people I personally find interesting.  The sole claim to
<br>
possible public interest in this is that some people, including some of the
<br>
ones I select, have liked my taste in people.
<br>
<p>I also cannot guarantee regular service, although I've been pretty good in the
<br>
last two weeks, and when I'm on the ball the digest is sorted, pruned, and
<br>
sometimes has interesting posts from the main list.
<br>
<p>A proper subset of selected people: Robin Hanson, Greg Burch, Max More, Hal
<br>
Finney, Amara Graps, Anders Sandberg, Sasha Chislenko (oops, should remove
<br>
that), me, and the not-me from Australia.
<br>
<p>There's no automatic subscription address, just me.  If you reply to the list
<br>
I'll laugh at you.  If you reply to the digest messages you'd end up writing
<br>
me; I don't think anyone's been dumb enough to do that by accident in the last
<br>
4-5 years, impressively enough.  Possibly because anyone subscribing has
<br>
basically given up on active participation.
<br>
<p>Caveat subscribor.
