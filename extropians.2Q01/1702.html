</em><br>
<p>In my original description of the Eugene Leitl lookup table, 
<br>
I specified that trillions of Earths would be run to generate 
<br>
all the possible situations in which Eugene would decide 
<br>
what he would do and say in every conceivable situation. Only 
<br>
in this way would the resultant piece of computronium do
<br>
everything that a real flesh-and-blood, or an uploaded, Eugene
<br>
would do.  Indeed it would learn, in the sense that you could
<br>
tell it something that it did not appear to know, but then 
<br>
would appear to know on subsequent occasions.
<br>
<p>Remember, you could have all sorts of adventures with this 
<br>
entity, roaming over our present day Earth in the search of 
<br>
fun times and high living. You and he would indeed become 
<br>
bosom companions, and share many moments of high emotion. 
<br>
However you may feel about Eugene now, you'd get to know
<br>
the real person.
<br>
<p>Yet in this scenario, the lights are on, but no one is home!
<br>
The piece of computronium experiences nothing.  Nor is it
<br>
conscious, even though it would pass any test as easily as
<br>
the real Eugene does.
<br>
<p>This is what's striking about the lookup table scenario. It
<br>
passes the Turing test, yet we hesitate to say that it is
<br>
intelligent.  It acts completely indistinguishably from a
<br>
real human being, but we cannot, I claim, believe that it
<br>
feels anything or is even as conscious as an insect.
<br>
<p>The reason is: take any five minute sequence of your best 
<br>
moments with this &quot;Eugene Leitl&quot;: while all the laughing
<br>
and rollicking corresponds to non-trivial data analyses
<br>
and information flow in your head, it's almost a random
<br>
sequence of lookups in &quot;his&quot;.  And, to reinterate, that 
<br>
sequence would be no different if it were activated in 
<br>
truly random order, or just layed out in a linear order
<br>
somewhere without being fetched at all.  And we are right
<br>
back to the silly Theory of Dust: it is simply absurd to
<br>
think that the same patterns that make up your life or mine,
<br>
though they could be &quot;found&quot; in any large enough nebula or
<br>
dust-cloud, are in those places anything but completely inert.
