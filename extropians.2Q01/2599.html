<p>That's one I haven't heard.  I suspect you would've been hard
<br>
pressed to find a white northerner of any stripe who wanted to see
<br>
a migration of blacks into the north.  Most had no intention of
<br>
ending slavery anything but very gradually, as it had ended over
<br>
the previous half-century or so in northern states.
<br>
<p>The north's reasons for waging war to prevent secession include
<br>
mostly bad ones (as &quot;paloeolibertarians&quot; love to point out, though
<br>
I'd be hard pressed to name a war not fought mostly for bad reasons),
<br>
though the south's primary reason for firing the first shots was
<br>
simple: preserve slavery.  Read the letters and oratory of
<br>
pro-secession southern politicians as the campaign for secession
<br>
was under way: the arguments are all about protecting huge investments
<br>
in slaves, protecting women and children from supposedly barbaric
<br>
Africans, and protecting the southern economy and way of life,
<br>
which they believed, or argued anyway, could not exist without
<br>
slavery.
<br>
<p>And the reason the south seceded in 1861?  They lost control of
<br>
the federal government, which they had a lock on for nearly all
<br>
of the nation's short history up to that point.  VERY quickly
<br>
pro-slavery southerners switched from using arguments for federal
<br>
power to enforce slavery to using state's rights arguments to
<br>
maintain slavery.  Most unfortunate, as mostly-meritorious arguments
<br>
for devolution of power are now tarred with racism in the US.
<br>
<p>See <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/nyrev/WWWfeatdisplay.cgi?20010412028R">http://www.nybooks.com/nyrev/WWWfeatdisplay.cgi?20010412028R</a>
<br>
for a review of some recent books on these topics.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; * Affirmative action and &quot;multiculturalism&quot; are undermining western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which I agree with entirely.
</em><br>
<p>I'm no fan of AA and perhaps not of multicultralism depending upon
<br>
how it's defined, though I'd say western civilization is much more
<br>
resilient than to be threatened by giving special privileges to
<br>
small minorities.  After all it survived for almost its entire
<br>
history giving special privileges to roughly half the population
<br>
(men) and expositing racial theories at least as bogus and destructive
<br>
as today's most virulent &quot;multiculturalist&quot;, so defined as to
<br>
include such people.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For reasons I do not understand paleos fawn over wholly inconsistent

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; libertarians as handmaidens of the fall, more or less.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't fawn over any cultural conservative, or kooks, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despise Pat Buchanan. So you need to come up with another theory...
</em><br>
<p>I can't find any record of you calling yourself a paleolibertarian
<br>
either.
