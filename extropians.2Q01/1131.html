<p>Greg, we can't really move the thing.  Recall that it would take more
<br>
than half the delta vee to move the existing hardware from the
<br>
commie 51 degrees down to zero inclination as it took to lift
<br>
the whole mess up there to start with.  We would need to supply
<br>
nearly 5000 m/sec to alllll thaaaat stuuuuuff thats already at 51
<br>
degees.  Inclination changes are a huge propellant devourer.
<br>
Like it or not, 51 degrees is where it stays.  {8-[
