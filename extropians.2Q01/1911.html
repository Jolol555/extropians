<em>&gt; According to Paul Craig Roberts, former undersecretary of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. Treasury and research fellow at The Independent Institute,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current economic turbulence can be traced directly to the Fed's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to anticipated public fears of the so-called millennium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bug.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duu.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;The Federal Reserve, thinking that Americans would withdraw a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tremendous amount of cash to protect themselves against computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crashes, added excess liquidity during 1999,&quot; Roberts writes in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent syndicated column. &quot;But Americans did not hoard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cash. Consequently, the liquidity found its way into stock prices.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;American's did not hoard cash&quot;?  Boy, what out of touch
<br>
universe is this person from?  He must not have seen any TV during
<br>
1999.  True, the fed likely did do a bit of an overcorrection because
<br>
of the pre Y2K hysteria.  But they were always way ahead of what was
<br>
&quot;common knowledge&quot; about what was occurring.  The Fed recognized the
<br>
overcorrection long before the actual Y2K.  While the rest of the
<br>
world was watching doom and glom TV shows and fearing the worst, the
<br>
Fed was already tightening monetary policies in an attempt to soak up
<br>
all the excess so many paranoid people had stashed in mattresses, and
<br>
some of which did make it into the stock market.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we been on some alternative system, say a Gold standard,
<br>
for example, there would have been zero flexibility in the system to
<br>
accommodate all the paranoid hoards putting cash in their mattresses.
<br>
We truly would haver seen a huge crash in the market during the years
<br>
before Y2K.  Not just a recession, but likely a real depression with
<br>
possible very long term slow down effects.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of a huge market swing in the negative direction
<br>
before Y2K, we saw an upswing.  Then after the Fed soaks up all that
<br>
excess liquidity (most of which was required to accommodate the
<br>
hoarders) during Y2K, things return to normal reality.  I don't know
<br>
why everyone is complaining so much.  Not only is there not a
<br>
depression, we've really just barely crossed the line and it's hard
<br>
to even claim we are in a real recession.  Growth has simply slowed so
<br>
we can all take a breath after the exciting times that was the
<br>
transition into the 3rd millennium.  Thank you Alan Greenspan!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only seems bad in comparison to the clearly unsustainable
<br>
100% annual growth rates we experienced during the last few years.
<br>
I'll take a few years of unbelievable growth followed by a mere
<br>
slowdown any day over a depression and the long term consequences to
<br>
growth such would surely have.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be no stronger testimony that the system is
<br>
working and that the current Federal Reserve System is doing good,
<br>
likely better than any other alternative I've ever heard about,
<br>
especially inflexible rigid unintelligent old fashioned alternatives
<br>
like &quot;The Gold Standard&quot;.
