<p>One thing that will probably keep natural gas as the fuel of choice is that 
<br>
hydrogen will embrittle and ultimately make steel gas lines fail. Also, 
<br>
hydrogen burns with a colorless flame (it does emit UV, that's how you can 
<br>
detect a hydrogen fire) so there are safety concerns with piping the pure 
<br>
gas around the country.
