<p>What's intuitive is as much a product of happenstance as of genuine
<br>
insight.
<br>
<p>To most individuals who have come of age in the 20th century,
<br>
regardless of their place on the political spectrum, the idea of a
<br>
system simply running itself without any centralized control
<br>
structures is counterintuitive.
<br>
<p>Instead of exploring these strange new twists, it would appear that
<br>
many prefer to bury themselves in 20th century concerns.  I suppose it
<br>
won't do any good to say yet one more time-- it's not about freedom,
<br>
nor about social/racial/economic/ad nauseaum justice. It's about the
<br>
inherent characteristics of large groups of sentiences capable of
<br>
negotiating and exchanging information.  What general principles
<br>
motivate their behavior? Can their aggregate behavior be predicted or
<br>
influenced? What new theoretical and analytical techniques do we need
<br>
to develop in order for social science to be a science more than in
<br>
name?
<br>
<p>The debates about the welfare state versus free markets are moot. The
<br>
markets have won. No single being or group of beings is capable of
<br>
keeping up with the complexity and chaos of our society to really be
<br>
capable of governing much more than a small community effectively
<br>
(well, at least until Eliezer finishes his work ;-) ) Get that through
<br>
your heads people-- you can pass all the laws you want but if you
<br>
can't enforce the laws nor collect taxes to continue maintaining the
<br>
appearance of enforcing them, it's over, welcome to Libertopia.
<br>
<p>Perhaps more productive than arguing about gun control, affirmative
<br>
action, welfare, etc. ad. naus. would be to start coming up with
<br>
workable free market alternatives to the services that so many people
<br>
depend on. That way when (not if) governments can no longer be relied
<br>
on to do what little they do, the transition will be as painless as
<br>
possible for the public.
