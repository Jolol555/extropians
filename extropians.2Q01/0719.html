<p>Would you like to find out that you, yourself, are simply a modeled
<br>
intelligence in someone's imagination?  That you therefore have no
<br>
citizenship rights?
<br>
<p>Clearly, then, you can't run this simulation at such fine granularity as
<br>
to result in actual citizen formation; you'll have to think about it at a
<br>
higher level of abstraction.  I don't expect this will pose a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i KNOW this is a repeat, but i have to ask, assuming above scenario,(or at

<p>What are you going to use for a starship?  Matter, right?  Where'd you get
<br>
the matter?  Our Solar System.  All the matter here is SysopMatter, though
<br>
this doesn't show up unless you want it to, or you try to zap someone
<br>
without their consent.  Totally transparent omnipresence doesn't look very
<br>
complicated to me.  Your starship is also SysopMatter; so, probably, are
<br>
you, though I suppose unmodified biology can probably be safely
<br>
Sysop-free.  If you build anything when you get to Centauri, you'll build
<br>
it using SysopMatter tools that produce more SysopMatter (assuming
<br>
Centauri hasn't already been colonized or declared a tourist reserve). 
<br>
All of this, again, is probably totally transparent - at least if you're
<br>
the kind of Luddite who prefers transparency - until you try to torture
<br>
somebody.
