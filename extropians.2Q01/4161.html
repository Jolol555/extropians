Here's a private exchange I had this morning with a friend of considerably 
<br>
&quot;pinker&quot; political sentiments than me:

<p><em>&gt; I just wonder if this is going to go the way that solar power did when

</em><br>

</em><br>
the &quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; pump it, burn it&quot; DOE of Cheney and Bush?  Your thoughts?  
</em><br>
<p>Fuel cell tech is much more likely to see significant implementation and 
<br>
further development over the next few years than solar photovoltaic did in 
<br>
the 1980s and 90s for a few very good reasons:
<br>
<p>1.  The technology is much closer to being practicable on scales that are 
<br>
meaningful for real-world applications at many scales than photovoltaic was 
<br>
in 1980, 1990 or even 2000.
<br>
<p>2.  Fuel cells scale to many different kinds of applications, from powering 
<br>
wristwatches and notebook computers, to households and cars.  Solar 
<br>
photovoltaic is still nowhere near such a level of development.  Further, the 
<br>
defense R&amp;D establishment has a MAJOR application crying out for fuel cells, 
<br>
which is the powering of man-portable systems (i.e. the Starship Troopers 
<br>
initiatives that are getting a LOT of attention these days).
<br>
<p>3.  Despite the fact that hydrocarbon fuels are still plentiful, we're seeing 
<br>
some artificially created &quot;energy crises&quot; in places like California and 
<br>
Europe.  These crises could be addressed quickly with technologies that are 
<br>
currently well understood and are relatively friendly to the environment, but 
<br>
the sausage grinder of legislation and regulation in these places is likely 
<br>
to continue to make a hash of energy policy for quite some time to come.  
<br>
Small-scale fuel cell generators offer individuals, small groups and 
<br>
enterprises a way to sidestep the still heavily-regulated power grid and 
<br>
solve an immediate problem: keeping the lights on.  This real current demand 
<br>
is IMMENSE and very well may drive development of fuel cells over the finish 
<br>
line to real products very quickly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And why does fuel cell technology have to be distributed to each 
</em><br>
household?  
<br>
<em>&gt; Wouldn't it make more sense to have large, super-efficient plants on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing grid?  I don't really think I want to have/deal with hydrogen 
</em><br>
tanks 
<br>
<em>&gt; around my house--on the other hand, we could take out a lot of heavily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polluting plants with this technology, and move toward improving the 
</em><br>
overall 
<br>
<em>&gt; efficiency of the grid.
</em><br>
<p>First, your question is based on the incorrect assumption that a fuel cell 
<br>
SYSTEM requires pure hydrogen as a fuel.  Many of the systems about to hit 
<br>
the market contain fuel reformer elements that allow them to run on natural 
<br>
gas.  Thus, the near-term goal is to be able to buy a reasonably-priced 
<br>
appliance to which you can connect existing gas lines to your home or 
<br>
business.  While these systems do produce carbon dioxide as a by-product, the 
<br>
net effluent of this waste gas is no more than what a central generating 
<br>
plant would exhaust to produce an equivalent amount of power and may well be 
<br>
less, given the higher efficiency of a catalytic fuel reformer over a 
<br>
combustion process, even the relatively clean combustion in a gas turbine.  
<br>
Furthermore and very important, the exhaust from a natural gas-powered fuel 
<br>
cell system doesn't contain the many trace gasses that arise as combustion 
<br>
by-products, especially NOx.  Beyond this, of course, the other by-product of 
<br>
a fuel cell, chemically pure H2O, would be an ecological boon to 
<br>
water-strapped areas.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, I don't disagree that we should and likely will see 
<br>
implementation of fuel cell technology on large scales as well as small 
<br>
scales.  I'm an advocate of small-scale implementation for social and 
<br>
political reasons as much as technological ones.  Competition from 
<br>
small-scale applications can only make the main power-grid system operators 
<br>
and regulators wake up and take notice.  For 125 years they've held a 
<br>
pampered, protected place in our industrial ecology and it's time they felt a 
<br>
little real pressure from another way of doing things.
