</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In my case, try a rather different background: an intellectual Jewish
<br>
household in the UK in the 1970's -- but one with a conservative political
<br>
outlook, albeit tempered by some sense of social responsibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You've raised the enormously interesting meta-question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of how it is we obtain our political beliefs, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has fascinated me since I was a kid.
</em><br>
<p>Some people simplistically rebel against their parents' outlook. Others
<br>
learn critical thinking, start to question authority, and the first
<br>
authorities they question in detail are (of course) their parents --
<br>
whose beliefs therefore get more critical attention than the other
<br>
side (whoever they might be).
<br>
<p>Fundamentally, I don't think the labels &quot;left wing&quot; and &quot;right wing&quot;
<br>
are particularly helpful. There are at least two dimensions we need
<br>
to bear in mind: how we value our individual autonomy and freedom, and
<br>
how responsible we feel for the society we live in. These can also be
<br>
summed up in terms of our attitude to &quot;rights&quot; -- the natural rights
<br>
or constructed rights debate, in other words.
<br>
<p>Personally, I feel that we all have a responsibility for the society
<br>
we live in -- a classic &quot;leftist&quot; attitude. However, I also feel that
<br>
we should seek to minimize limitations on our individual autonomy, and
<br>
maximize freedom -- classic &quot;libertarian&quot; (i.e. non-authoritarian
<br>
rightist) attitudes. This combination of beliefs simply doesn't fit
<br>
in the simplistic unidimensional yardstick we usually use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then there is the geographical factor: people in English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking countries besides America, who in my own private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation are totally up to speed on everything else, don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fathom Hayek and Von Mieses and sound to me clueless on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic issues.  In other words, were they living in America,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'd probably be agreeing with me, and if I were living in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, Australia, then I'd be agreeing with them.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Probably. It's important to bear in mind the fact that the business
<br>
environment, and social conditions, differ considerably. For example,
<br>
from a UK point of view, the American government bureaucracy extremely
<br>
officious (in a most obnoxious manner) and capable of horrifyingly
<br>
oppressive actions. 
<br>
<p>I have a hypothesis that in the US, government service attracts a
<br>
proportion of petty tyrants -- control freaks, in a nuthshell -- who are
<br>
there because it's the easiest way to acquire legal powers to act out
<br>
their wet dreams on the general public. There's a small element of this
<br>
personality type in the UK in public service, notably among the police,
<br>
but in general it's a lot rarer.  The &quot;leftist&quot; attitudes that permeate
<br>
society are idealistic: they lead people into public sector work because
<br>
they want to do good, rather than because they want to exercise the
<br>
billy-club of state power.
<br>
<p>As a result, attitudes to state power are different: when you're less
<br>
likely to run into a little tin god on a power trip, you can afford to be 
<br>
more laid back about the idea of government intervention. This attitude
<br>
reaches its peak in places like Italy where there are lots of incredibly
<br>
dumb laws, and numerous public officials -- but for the most part,
<br>
everyone ignores the more idiotic laws in order to get on with life,
<br>
and there are no witch hunts to weed out the Eevil Felonious Lawbreakers
<br>
Among Us (except when they happen to be mafiosi who plant bombs under
<br>
the cars of investigating magistrates). 
<br>
<p>If Italy had its current criminal code and the same attitude to
<br>
enforcement as the USA, everybody there would suffer an instant nervous
<br>
breakdown. Or there'd be a libertarian revolution.  But they don't take
<br>
their government too seriously -- hell, even the *government* doesn't
<br>
take itself too seriously -- so there isn't a problem.
<br>
<p>I think a chunk of the problem with the US government is that America has
<br>
this deep-rooted cultural fixation with efficiency. This is great stuff
<br>
in business or engineering, but extending it into everyday life leads to
<br>
nightmarish social consequences. The solution isn't to hold a revolution
<br>
or kill all the lawyers/politicians/communists/leftists or other enemy
<br>
of the day; the answer is to teach petty control freaks to chill out
<br>
and enjoy life instead of inflicting their misery on everyone else.
