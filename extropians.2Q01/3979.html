<br>
<p><em>&gt;A reversible computer is as likely to take a step backwards as forwards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So even if it manages to complete a calculation from A to B, the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be a random walk, moving forward and backwards many times over each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;portion of the path from A to B.
</em><br>
<p>This thought is entirely new to me, yet makes perfect sense.
<br>
(After all, truly deterministic and spontaneous action occurs
<br>
only when entropy increases, no?)  But in none of my readings on
<br>
reversible computation have I ever seen this point made.  So what
<br>
is going on?  Perhaps the authors of most works assume that you'd
<br>
need just a tiny minimal amount of entropy increase to drive a
<br>
calculation forward, and then an equally tiny increase in entropy
<br>
to drive it backwards.
<br>
<p>If you then keep decreasing such a minimal entropy increase, then
<br>
&quot;mistakes&quot; occur, and the process takes a step backwards while its
<br>
long term progress is forward, and vice-versa.  Random walks with
<br>
p arbitrarily close to .5 do eventually move in the right direction.
<br>
Perhaps Hal's point isn't as significant as I was beginning to think
<br>
(he implies that it's not terribly significant).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now if we interpret each step of the computer as instantiating a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bubble of conscious experience, then the consciousness will move forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and backwards in time just like the computer.  You'll think thought 1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then thought 2, then you'll think thought 2 backwards, then forwards
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again, then thought 3, then thought 3 backwards, 2 backwards, 1 backwards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1 forwards, and so on.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However of course the conscious mind is not aware of this.  The structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the computer is such that it would have no memory of having gone back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and forth like this.  In the end when it thinks back over what happened,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it will remember thought 1, then 2, then 3, and so on, straight on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the end.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So there is a real disconnect in this case between what we hypothesize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happening from a functional perspective, and what we have evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happening based on the reports of the conscious mind.  All we truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have evidence for is that the computation did exist, did complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We don't know whether the mind really experienced going backwards and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forwards like that.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And we especially don't know what form the consciousness took during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the reverse steps.  What does it feel like to have memories erased
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than stored?  There is no way to ask a person and find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(that I can see).  Certainly if you ask them after a step is reversed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the answer will obviously be the same as if the step never occured.
</em><br>
<p>I would like to insert here that &quot;the feel&quot;, itself, is a rather long
<br>
computational process.  Therefore, so far as I can see, it probably
<br>
makes no difference to the conclusion here that you and others (who
<br>
are also up to speed on this issue) arrive at.  Thus it follows that
<br>
if you had to choose between an experience that expended entropy X but
<br>
backtracked at numerous points, and the same experience that went
<br>
straight to the conclusion, but expended 2X entropy, then you
<br>
should be indifferent.
<br>
<p>But not me.  In 1996, I started a thread called &quot;Repeated Experience&quot;,
<br>
and I think that I won all the arguments about it---or at least didn't
<br>
lose---except for one point Robin Hanson got me on.  I was (and still
<br>
am) convinced that in almost all thought experiments, repeated 
<br>
experience is to be reckoned as highly as the &quot;original&quot; (identical)
<br>
experience.  I mean (and meant) that to be taken quite literally.
<br>
<p>So I, on the other hand, might prefer the longer &quot;back-tracking&quot; 
<br>
experience, since I would gain more additional desireable runtime
<br>
from it (unless, of course, it was undesireable experience).
<br>
<p>:-)  For example, if you and I attend the same party and are 
<br>
equally ravished, then I might be able to prove to you that
<br>
it &quot;lasted longer&quot; for me (even though I don't remember it),
<br>
and point out that certain exceedingly pleasurable transitions
<br>
that occurred during the party were experienced by me many,
<br>
many times, and by you only once.
<br>
