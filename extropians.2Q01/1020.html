<p>The page that started this thread, <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/lifeinsim.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/lifeinsim.html</a>,
<br>
was written as a response to the widespread claim that it doesn't
<br>
matter if we live in a simulation.  If it is a complete simulation,
<br>
they it doesn't matter as much, but it can matter a lot more if it
<br>
is a partial simulation.
<br>
<p>Curt Adams has given a spirited defense of the notion that a partial
<br>
simulation is impossible - claiming we would discover its partiality
<br>
via deviations from what a full simulation would compute.  And I do
<br>
agree that as we learn more about our world and monitor it in more
<br>
detail, it becomes more and more expensive to avoid detectable deviations.
<br>
But partial simulations, much cheaper than full, still seem possible
<br>
to me.
<br>
<p>If it were substantially more expensive to fool astronomers, the God
<br>
running a simulation might be tempted to mess more with astronomer minds,
<br>
perhaps even using actors who play them, etc.  Maybe this is why
<br>
astronomers tend to be oddball types :-).
