Hmmm, I think the Blue people have messed up again
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(or it could be just be flakey software...)

<p>Seems signed by Nick:
<br>
<em>&gt; (A bizarre thought, admittedly, but I was thinking of including it in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; footnote in the next version.) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nick Bostrom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Department of Philosophy 
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it is a mis-quote of previous messages.
<br>
<p>Regarding:
<br>
<em>&gt; How do you know that there is suffering?
</em><br>
I have to agree with Robert [Nick?] here.  I think that Brent's position
<br>
may be related to his interest in qualia.  Perhaps Brent expereiences
<br>
these &quot;emotions&quot; to a greater extent than others do.  This might even
<br>
be genetic (as some women can effectivly get 4-color vision while
<br>
the men usually get stuck with 3-color vision or sometimes only
<br>
2-color vision).
<br>
<p>In any case, I will hold up the process or state of &quot;enlightenment&quot;
<br>
to back up the question being posed.  In my experience of enlightenment,
<br>
my perspective shifted from &quot;being&quot; the emotions or feelings to
<br>
&quot;having&quot; the emotions or feelings.  That is a subtle but important
<br>
difference because it allows you to make a &quot;choice&quot; about how
<br>
one wishes to perceive those emotions or feelings (at least on a
<br>
good day).  Now, the example of sticking a needle in ones finger
<br>
is good because you have neurons there and those neurons are designed
<br>
to make you feel pain and react.  These are an important part
<br>
of the nervous system of higher species that provide a survival
<br>
benefit.  Now, you can &quot;perceive&quot; those pain impulses as &quot;pain&quot;
<br>
and &quot;suffering&quot; or you can perceive them simply as a sharp piece
<br>
of metal being inserted into your finger.  Unfortunately most of
<br>
humanity isn't very good at reducing physiological sensations
<br>
to abstract statements about reality.  { Pointers to an exception
<br>
I can think of are attached... }  (I would cite for example
<br>
sword swallowers as examples of individuals who learn to reject
<br>
the standard responses the body evolved to produce.)
<br>
<p>So it could be quite interesting to consider that the purpose
<br>
of the simulation is to allow us to evolve to the point where
<br>
everyone agrees that the interpretation of a perception (qualia?)
<br>
as &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;suffering&quot; is a choice that all people may
<br>
or may not make.  If that is the case then we all eventually
<br>
get to the point in which the running of amoral simulations
<br>
(in which the actors are making choices to experience their
<br>
perceptions as &quot;pain&quot; or &quot;suffering&quot; is quite a natural thing to do).
<br>
<p>Ultimately allowing &quot;free will&quot;, means that you must allow the
<br>
simulated entities to experience pain and suffering in &quot;life&quot;.
<br>
Doing otherwise would be removing their choice in the matter
<br>
thus denying them the opportunity to develop to the realization
<br>
that they really do have a choice about how they experience &quot;reality&quot;.

Some people clearly do have the ability to endure great suffering,
