<em>&gt;Subject: Fluoridation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OK, I had never thought that there was any reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe that there was anything wrong with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fluoridated drinking supply. But, I have a habit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exploring viewpoints that I disagree with, so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought I'd see if these anti-fluoridation people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all complete flakes, or simply deluded, or what.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, I now have serious doubts about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fluoridation. After dispensing with the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flakes, like the &quot;Fluoride is government mind control&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people, I found some things that were actually useful:

<em>&gt;The above is about a guy who was the Principal Dental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Officer of Auckland, New Zealand who, while doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research to become New Zealand's expert on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fluoridation to lead a campaign to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fluoridation, came to change his mind completely.

<em>&gt;Fluoridation also appears to be banned in most of

<em>&gt;I'm sure there are people here that know much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more about this stuff than I do, so... Comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;please?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suppose this doesn't really relate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism very well, but what the hell... :-)

<p>We have a flouridated system here in Ireland, and of late there's been much 
<br>
discussion regarding it.
<br>
<p>When it was first introduced, the law made provision for studies to be 
<br>
carried out on an on-going basis to determine long term trends.  In fact I 
<br>
believe the law required it.  People have been questioning why this was 
<br>
never done, and the overall health issues involved.
<br>
<p>I've seen a flyer in a local herb/vitamin/alt. medicine store about 
<br>
this.  It's put out by a nun I believe.  She goes on about various 
<br>
chemicals being present (lead, plutonium etc) in the water supply.  Some of 
<br>
them sounded a bit suspect, others would need verification.  If people are 
<br>
interested in this topic, I might be able to get one of them.
<br>
<p>Overall, I don't know enough about the issue yet to make a call.  Anyone else?
<br>
<p>James....

&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
