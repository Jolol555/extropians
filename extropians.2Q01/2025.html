</em><br>
<p>Well, Spike, the way I read it is that the Bill of Rights *can* be
<br>
repealed by the normal constitutional amendment process: vote 2/3 house
<br>
and senate, 3/4 state legislatures.  It's *called* the Bill of Rights, but
<br>
are technically just the first 10 Amendments.  Unlikely, but possible. 
<br>
Maybe For The Children, to win The War on Drugs and School Shootings.
<br>
<p>Actions short of this would cause the military to look closely at the
<br>
&quot;preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution&quot; clause of their oathes.
<br>
The tradition of deferral to civil authority is so strong, however, that
<br>
it would have to be completely unambiguous.  The Supreme Court deciding
<br>
that the 2nd amendment only applies to the National Guard, or that the 1st
<br>
only applies to talking to your friends in private and printing a
<br>
newspaper, probably wouldn't be enough.  Bush declaring himself &quot;President
<br>
for Life&quot; and dissolving Congress might...but even then I think that they
<br>
are aware that once the Rubicon is crossed, the Constitution is probably
<br>
dead no matter what they do.
<br>
<p>It would indeed be a U.S. military officer's worst nightmare.
