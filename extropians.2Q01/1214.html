They're beginning to walk, talk, and, yes, think like people.
<br>
Is the age of the robo sapien just around the corner?
<br>
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_12/b3724007.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_12/b3724007.htm</a>
<br>
Your Next Doctor May Not Be Human
<br>
Chart: The Robot Population Is Growing
<br>
<p>It's 1996. Japan's economy is lurching toward recession. Instead of
<br>
investing in a new generation of expensive industrial robots, Japan is
<br>
shipping more production offshore to Southeast Asia and other cheap-labor
<br>
locales. It's a tough time for Tatsuzo Ishida, Sony Corp.'s (SNE ) ace
<br>
robotics engineer. He has spent the past 15 years developing steel-collar
<br>
workers to assemble millions of Walkmen, handycams, and game consoles in
<br>
Sony's Japanese factories. With Sony joining the exodus, the future of
<br>
factory robots looks dim.
<br>
<p>Being a robot maniac, Ishida refuses to throw in the towel. Instead, he
<br>
hatches an outrageous plan. Together with comrade-in-arms Yoshihiro
<br>
Kuroki, he proposes that Sony engineer a whole new species of humanoid
<br>
entertainment bots, along the lines of C-3PO, the golden chatterbox in
<br>
Star Wars. The technical challenges are tremendous. Nobody has yet built a
<br>
biped that can stroll blithely through a house, maneuvering around
<br>
furniture and dodging people--unaided by a human controller. And if the
<br>
robotmeisters actually achieve their goal, Sony could face major liability
<br>
risks. How long before one of the creatures trips and topples onto a
<br>
toddler, or wanders into the path of a car on its way to the supermarket?
<br>
<p>To Ishida's amazement, Sony goes for the idea, despite all the potential
<br>
snags. The new business development chief, Shingo Tamura, turns out to be
<br>
as much of a robot nut as Ishida and Kuroki. All three studied humanoids
<br>
at Waseda University's famed robotics lab in Tokyo. &quot;Anyone else would
<br>
have dismissed us as lunatics,&quot; admits Ishida. &quot;But we shared this dream
<br>
of building personal robots.&quot;
<br>
<p>Last November, Ishida's dream took its first bow in public. At a time when
<br>
the world was going gaga over Aibo, Sony's insanely cute robotic puppy,
<br>
Ishida and Kuroki put a half-dozen prototype humanoids through their paces
<br>
in Yokohama at Robodex, a new expo for personal robots. The crowd was
<br>
spellbound as the pint-size acrobats, just 50 cm tall, jumped, danced, and
<br>
kicked mini soccer balls. No one minded that the bots were fed cues over a
<br>
wireless computer network. The acrobots were real. Now the future had a
<br>
symbol of hope called SDR, or Sony Dream Robot (view a Sony promotional
<br>
video for SDR).
<br>
<p>SDR and other robots at the expo caused a sensation in Japan. Years from
<br>
now, Robodex may be remembered as a watershed event. While Aibo and its
<br>
ilk now hog the headlines, scientists and engineers in laboratories across
<br>
Japan, the U.S., and Europe are struggling to build far more sophisticated
<br>
bots in the image of humans. The timetable is fuzzy, but so-called robo
<br>
sapiens could be strolling sidewalks by decade's end. Whenever it happens,
<br>
the new humanoids promise huge benefits to society--and financial bonanzas
<br>
to their creators.
<br>
<p>SOCIAL SKILLS. Many of the inventors are inspired by the sheer scope of
<br>
the technical challenges. The complexity of building supercomputers,
<br>
erecting skyscrapers, or even designing whole cities pales beside the task
<br>
of imbuing machines with humanlike motor skills, synthetic sight, smell,
<br>
hearing, and touch, plus something that approximates human intelligence.
<br>
But the robo-maniacs feel driven to make it happen. &quot;We have an image of
<br>
robots as partners, and a machine similar to humans can evoke shared
<br>
feelings,&quot; says Masato Hirose, 45, a Honda Motor Corp. designer who has
<br>
built a line of stair-climbing robots. Atsuo Takanishi, 44, a professor of
<br>
robotics at Waseda, says visions of helper bots took root in his
<br>
childhood, as he &quot;grew up watching cartoons of Atom Boy,&quot; a sort of
<br>
robotic Mighty Mouse. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media
<br>
Lab, researcher Cynthia Breazeal sounds the same chords. For robots to be
<br>
meaningful companions, &quot;they must be socially savvy,&quot; says the 33-year-old
<br>
researcher. So her creation, named Kismet, is learning to recognize human
<br>
emotions--and has a nimble face to express its own moods. &quot;If the robot
<br>
wasn't anthropomorphic, it wouldn't work,&quot; she says.
<br>
<p>Beyond psychology, humans could make good use of mechanical devices that
<br>
walk, talk, and think like us but vastly exceed our capabilities in
<br>
memory, computational skills, and raw physical strength. Heavy industry
<br>
wants such creatures for labor in hazardous environments. The military
<br>
wants them to shoulder a soldier's burden on the battlefield. The Japanese
<br>
government wants them to help care for Japan's swelling ranks of elderly
<br>
people. And Sony figures the best place to launch this revolution is
<br>
entertainment. Since dancing and singing robots like SDR don't do anything
<br>
essential, says Kuroki, &quot;it's O.K. if they make a mistake sometimes.&quot; That
<br>
would be only human, after all.
<br>
<p>None of Japan's humanoids can brew coffee or do the laundry--yet. But the
<br>
next-generation technologies that robo sapiens will need are being refined
<br>
today--often in the shapes of other animals. Chances seem good that Aibo
<br>
and other robo pets will evolve into Japan's next great export wave. And
<br>
following in the toys' wake could be all manner of household robots, from
<br>
steel guard dogs to autonomous vacuum cleaners and kitchen &quot;Cuisinbots.&quot;
<br>
Already in Japan, toylike robots are reminding senior citizens to take
<br>
medicine and keep appointments. And future plans call for bundling more
<br>
advanced computers and mechanisms into roving maids and butlers. &quot;Robots
<br>
are just on the verge of becoming intelligent machines,&quot; maintains Honda's
<br>
Hirose.
<br>
<p>Humanlike robots were stirring imaginations long before the word &quot;robot&quot;
<br>
entered the English language in R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), a 1921
<br>
play by Czech writer Karel Capek. In ancient Greece, Aristotle wished for
<br>
mechanical slaves that would obey people. In the Middle Ages, people
<br>
marveled at mechanical crowing roosters and clockwork automatons. But
<br>
those mechanisms were anchored down. For real versatility, robots must be
<br>
mobile--and robot companions must walk on two legs. That's a major
<br>
engineering challenge.
<br>
<p>Bipedal movement is essentially a continuous, controlled fall that's
<br>
avoided only by precisely timing each step. People do it without thinking,
<br>
so it seems simple. But the computational horsepower needed to prevent a
<br>
biped bot from falling on its face is considerable. Early mobile robots
<br>
had to drag a cable connecting them to a big computer.
<br>
<p>RECHARGING. Now that the underpinnings for smart robots are falling into
<br>
place, turning Atom Boy into superbot has become something of a national
<br>
obsession in Japan. Researchers in dozens of corporate and academic labs
<br>
are racing to develop working models that within a few years may become
<br>
our cohabitants and co-workers. The leaders--companies such as Matsushita
<br>
Electric Industrial (MC ), NEC (NIPNY ), Sony, and Omron (OMTEY )--are
<br>
investing tens of millions of dollars annually in the development of
<br>
personal robots. Toyota (TM ) now wants to join this clique. And Honda
<br>
(HMC ) has spent roughly $100 million since work on its first experimental
<br>
unit, EO, started in 1986.
<br>
<p>After dropping behind in information technology, Japan needs a new
<br>
industry to recharge economic growth. It's one reason why the Ministry of
<br>
Economy, Trade &amp;amp; Industry (METI, formerly MITI) is backing research in
<br>
the field. In 1998, METI coughed up $50 million in seed money to nurture
<br>
development of a humanoid by 2003. Japan's leaders figure home-care robots
<br>
for the elderly will soon be a social necessity: By 2005, 25% of Japan's
<br>
population will be over age 65.
<br>
<p>Personal robots won't even approach their full potential in this decade,
<br>
but robot makers have already fielded many commercial previews. Although
<br>
sometimes clumsy and unpredictable, service robots are functioning as
<br>
guards in warehouses, delivering hospital food trays, and carrying
<br>
documents from one office to another. The Japan Robot Assn. (Jara)
<br>
estimates that by 2002, some 11,000 service robots will be deployed, 65%
<br>
of them in hospitals and nursing homes. By 2005, give or take a year, Jara
<br>
projects that health-care robots will be a $250 million market, then hit
<br>
$1 billion by 2010--approaching 10% of the total market that year. As for
<br>
personal bots, a panel of industry and academic experts last year
<br>
predicted they will be as common as PCs and cell phones within 10 or 15
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>One of the first robo sapiens on the market will be Honda's Asimo, a
<br>
1.2-meter-tall android that resembles a child astronaut. It strides
<br>
confidently, climbs stairs, and negotiates corners. It can turn out the
<br>
lights, and to show off, walk a figure eight or compete with Sony's SDR
<br>
bots on the dance floor. The hitch is that Asimo currently is blind, deaf,
<br>
and dumb--and must be remotely controlled. Over the next few months, says
<br>
Hirose, it will be equipped with programs and artificial senses that will
<br>
render it autonomous. This fall, for an undisclosed fee, Honda will start
<br>
renting Asimo to companies and museums for use as a visitor's guide.
<br>
<p>PERSONABLE. Another robot about to hatch is Pino, an infantlike android
<br>
built by Hiroaki Kitano, an artificial-intelligence (AI) expert who heads
<br>
his own government-funded research group, Kitano Symbiotic Systems
<br>
Project, in Tokyo. Pino is outfitted with neural-network circuits that
<br>
will one day mimic the human brain, thus enabling it to learn to walk and
<br>
ape humans.
<br>
<p>Sony has already proved that mechanical companions are a promising market.
<br>
Now, sales of entertainment robots, it believes, are primed to explode.
<br>
These include electronic critters like the $1,500 Aibo, which can learn
<br>
tricks and respond to voice commands. The latest model looks like a lion
<br>
cub. Over the next five years, an expanding menagerie of mechanical pets
<br>
from Sony and others could whet consumer demand. And then, around
<br>
mid-decade, Sony's acrobots should hit the market--probably at prices
<br>
comparable to a high-end PC. Come the 2010s, predicts Toshi T. Doi, head
<br>
of Sony's Digital Creatures Lab, each of Japan's 46 million households
<br>
will have two or three robots, including a humanoid.
<br>
<p>Researchers everywhere are equally fascinated by the potential of home
<br>
robots and cyber-companions. Ironically, some European and North American
<br>
labs are counting on biological approaches to help produce mechanical
<br>
beings--a tack called evolutionary robotics. The basic idea is to raise a
<br>
machine like a child, letting it learn from its own experiences and
<br>
sensory impressions, rather than feeding it canned software written by
<br>
humans. Hothouses of this research include the University of Sussex in
<br>
Britain and Switzerland's University of Lausanne--and MIT and Michigan
<br>
State University. At Brandeis University, the Golem Project has even
<br>
produced robots that design and build other robots.
<br>
<p>MIT's Cog and Kismet are probably the most famous of the self-educated
<br>
bots. Cog is the brainchild of Rodney A. Brooks, head of MIT's AI Lab.
<br>
This humanoid torso has been learning to interact with its surroundings
<br>
and with people since its &quot;birth&quot; in 1993. Cog has mentally progressed to
<br>
the crawling-infant stage--although its legs have yet to be attached.
<br>
Cog's face is less expressive than Kismet's, but even so, it can be
<br>
engaging. Its camera eyes track moving people, and it establishes eye
<br>
contact with people facing it. Almost invariably, says Brooks, visitors
<br>
and researchers quickly treat Cog as a person, despite its skinless metal
<br>
skeleton.
<br>
<p>No matter how personable Cog may seem, fulfilling Brooks's dream of a
<br>
robot with human-level intelligence remains on the distant horizon. Still,
<br>
many experts believe truly smart robots are inevitable, given the
<br>
ever-growing power of computer chips. Computing power increases a
<br>
thousandfold every 15 years, notes Sony's Doi, so it's only a matter of
<br>
time before even little metal pets like Aibo become intelligent. &quot;Robots
<br>
will be able to have normal conversations and even gossip with humans,&quot; he
<br>
predicts.
<br>
<p>At the other end of the &quot;evo-bot&quot; scale are the creeping creations of Mark
<br>
W. Tilden, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Most of his
<br>
buglike robots don't even have a microprocessor brain, just some sensors.
<br>
They function on the basis of primitive survival instincts. Yet some
<br>
fairly complex behaviors can evolve. For example, a solar-powered
<br>
mechanical insect has one purpose: to soak up energy from the sun's rays.
<br>
But give it legs, and it gradually learns to walk so it can follow the sun
<br>
on its path across the sky. Give it suction-cup feet with attached
<br>
brushes, and it will keep a window clean--following the rising sun up the
<br>
window, scrubbing as it tries to crawl closer to the light.
<br>
<p>Tilden has harnessed similar mindless creatures to clip grass, clean up
<br>
dust, and draw draperies. A decade ago, he founded a movement called BEAM
<br>
(for biology, electronics, aesthetics, and mechanics) to popularize simple
<br>
robots. There's now a worldwide army of BEAM aficionados, including
<br>
schoolkids. They stage contests and swap tales of how many robots parts
<br>
were scavenged from trash cans and junkyards. &quot;You can build a BEAM robot
<br>
for next to nothing, and you don't have to write an elaborate program,&quot;
<br>
says Tilden. &quot;But more important, it shows you the power of biology as a
<br>
model.&quot;
<br>
<p>FRUSTRATION. There are a lots of BEAM proponents in Europe--and many
<br>
researchers there also share Japan's view of the near-term need for
<br>
personal robots. For example, Germany's Fraunhofer Institute has developed
<br>
Care-O-Bot, which looks a bit like R2D2, to help elderly and infirm people
<br>
maintain independent lifestyles. It can guide and support people who are
<br>
unsteady on their feet, run errands around the house, and operate home
<br>
electronics.
<br>
<p>In the U.S., though, getting the funds to turn robot research into a going
<br>
business has been a problem, laments Joseph F. Engelberger. Widely hailed
<br>
as the father of the industrial robot, Engelberger co-founded Unimation
<br>
Inc. 40 years ago and created the factory-robot industry from scratch.
<br>
After cashing out in 1983, he founded HelpMate Robotics Inc. (HELP ) to
<br>
build service robots. His flagship: wheeled cabinets that scurry around
<br>
hospitals, distributing medicines and patient records. But Engelberger
<br>
always had his eyes on domestic robots because the market potential is
<br>
clearly far bigger.
<br>
<p>In 1997, HelpMate built a two-armed, wheeled prototype for NASA to
<br>
evaluate as a helpmate in space. Engelberger intended to adapt it for home
<br>
use, since its touch-sensitive hands and two arms could make beds and
<br>
prepare meals for seniors. But it was not to be. He couldn't raise the $5
<br>
million he needed to bring it to market, and financial problems forced him
<br>
to sell the company in 1999. This lack of interest in robotics puzzles the
<br>
Japanese. Many reckon it's because Hollywood often depicts robots as
<br>
monsters, whereas the Japanese view them as helpers.
<br>
<p>As a result, Japan has amassed a formidable stockpile of robotics knowhow.
<br>
It has long been the world's largest manufacturer of industrial robots,
<br>
producing twice as many as the rest of the world combined. Last year,
<br>
robot shipments, including exports, came to $5.7 billion. Export sales
<br>
alone--$3 billion--outclassed total production in every other country.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, Japan has an army of young, savvy robotics experts. Close to
<br>
half of its 4,500 registered robot engineers are focused on AI or related
<br>
disciplines aimed at enhancing robot intelligence. &quot;The level of AI
<br>
research in Japan and the U.S. is now the same,&quot; asserts Takanori Shibata,
<br>
34, who studied under Brooks at MIT. Shibata is a senior scientist with
<br>
the governmental Mechanical Engineering Lab in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo.
<br>
His creations are plumbing interactions between people and robots. Paro
<br>
the baby seal responds to human touch and is a big hit with children at a
<br>
university hospital ward, where the cuddly crawler is being tested as a
<br>
therapy tool. And Shibata's cat robot will be marketed this year as a
<br>
companion for the elderly by Omron Corp.
<br>
<p>SONG AND DANCE. Shoestring budgets at Waseda University and other academic
<br>
labs nourished Japan's early robot dreams. Now, well-heeled Japanese
<br>
corporations are transforming research into commercial products. For
<br>
example, Sony cut a deal with Waseda, in effect purchasing its expertise
<br>
and hiring Takanishi as an adviser to its SDR program.
<br>
<p>Backed by ample resources, corporate engineers are now busily refining
<br>
sensors and rewriting algorithms to create more sophisticated machines.
<br>
Sony's Ishida and Kuroki developed a new kind of compact, lightweight
<br>
motor for their robot's 24 joints. The motors are one reason why SDR can
<br>
prance along at 15 meters a minute, keep its balance on a seesaw, do the
<br>
twist, and even stand up after falling down.
<br>
<p>Honda engineer Hirose turned to biology for help with Asimo. After his son
<br>
was born in 1988, he studied his progress from a crawler to a toddler. &quot;I
<br>
recorded a lot of videotapes of my son's first years, but they show only
<br>
his legs,&quot; he quips. The tapes served an important purpose, though. Hirose
<br>
realized that nerves in the sole of the human foot are vital for walking.
<br>
So he attached sensors to the robot's feet to help Asimo locate the edge
<br>
of stair steps and maintain its center of gravity on sloping ground.
<br>
<p>As margins dwindle on consumer electronics and industrial equipment,
<br>
Japan's manufacturers are desperately seeking new genres of products.
<br>
Smart robots that combine a virtuoso entertainer, flawless social
<br>
secretary, compliant maid-butler, patient listener, and multimedia
<br>
communications system could be just the ticket. Such companions could
<br>
record the passing years and regale people with intricately detailed
<br>
multimedia stories of family triumphs and personal exploits. Anything that
<br>
owners forget, their cyber-companions would remember.
<br>
<p>The chief blemish on Japan's bullish outlook is that buyers might expect
<br>
too much from the first crop of bots. Early androids may not have enough
<br>
finesse to poke around inside packed refrigerators, and people might be
<br>
wise not to trust them to iron shirts. &quot;Just because robots can sing and
<br>
dance doesn't mean they'll soon do everything,&quot; cautions Shigeo Hirose, a
<br>
robotics professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Aibo the robo pet has
<br>
proved they don't have to. Robots can ease their way into our lives, step
<br>
by mechanical step.
