<p><em>&gt;As I said in my last message, &quot;I was making a *normative* argument about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational beliefs, not a descriptive model of actual beliefs.&quot;  If there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are constraints on what beliefs are rational, then upon discovering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that your beliefs violate those constraints, you should want to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your beliefs to avoid those violations.  This sort of change seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perfectly rational to me, even if it violates a naive Bayesianism.
</em><br>
<p>Bayesianism is a certain process for updating beliefs based on evidence.  
<br>
Maintaining your priors isn't a part of &quot;naive&quot; Bayesianism; it's an 
<br>
essential part of Bayesianism, period.  Change your beliefs any other way and 
<br>
you're bookable.  If your claim is that Bayesians are naive and you have a 
<br>
better way, fine, but a) that needs justification and b) be upfront about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;You assume everybody agree on world_state_function/belief_state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on probability(belief_state).  It's trivial to derive a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;belief-state-independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;world state function (i.e. a prior) just by averaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;world_state_function/belief_state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;by probability(belief_state).  So you do assume everybody has the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;uberprior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't follow you.  My short paper <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/priof.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/priof.pdf</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describes uberpriors as q_i, where the i subscript allows different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people to have different uberpriors.  I do not require q_i = q_j.
</em><br>
<p>I apologize for misreading your assumptions.  I knew you had the assumption 
<br>
of shared uberpriors in there and missed that it wasn't explicit.  It's a 
<br>
consequence of the extremely strong consistency assumption.  Your consistency 
<br>
assumption requires that all possible views be consistent with my view in the 
<br>
sense that they derive from my uberprior with only the evidence of their own 
<br>
existence.  As I showed, this requires the belief probabilities follow the 
<br>
distribution function f(A) = cA/(1-A).  Beliefs from that distribution follow 
<br>
your consistency assumption only with an uberprior of 1/(1+c).  
<br>
<p>Under the more normal assumption that uninformed priors are not highly 
<br>
informative, the only prior that meets the consistency assumption with my 
<br>
prior is my prior.  So your consistency assumption holds, in effect, that 
<br>
either a) all beliefs result from highly informative brainstates, reasoning 
<br>
from a shared uberprior or b) everybody has the same prior.  Neither holds 
<br>
for people.  Your consistency assumption could hold only for interactions 
<br>
between backups of one perfectly rational individual.
<br>
<p>If you are maintaining that human beings should commonize priors, you have 
<br>
demonstrated this is not true if people are Bayesian (given what we know 
<br>
about people).  You've been suggesting that Bayesian humans should coordinate 
<br>
priors by Bayesian reasoning; but based on your work that has to be modified 
<br>
to a recomendation that some currently unspecified groups of non-Bayesian 
<br>
people should coordinate priors by some currently unspecified non-Bayesian 
<br>
method.  Call these unspecified groups and methods &quot;Hansonists&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;Hansonism&quot;. From what you've said in the past Hansonists should be &quot;people 
<br>
who follow Bayesian inference except that they coordinate priors with other 
<br>
Hansonists.&quot;  My best guess for Hansonism is &quot;the procedure that results from 
<br>
participation in an idea futures market&quot; but I'm less sure of this, since 
<br>
that's not formally defined.
