<p><em>&gt; But, given that ninety percent of the problem has been solved, especially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the younger generations, the best way to finally damp the problem out

</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression that you are mentally keeping track of what race a person is. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why I object to this subject line. A physicist inventing time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel is a triumph for physicists.
</em><br>
<p>About the subject line: I agree with Eliezer, and am sorry that I started
<br>
the old subject line, &quot;if a black physicist invents time travel&quot;.  It was
<br>
in marginally bad taste.
<br>
<p>But the issue of how long racism will be with us is, as Mike says, not
<br>
so simple.  I, too, find there to be less racism among the young than 
<br>
formerly, but I'm afraid that this may be true only of the people that
<br>
I associate with.  I fear that the media is ignoring a certain amount
<br>
of racism that is alive and well among everyone, not just the young.
<br>
<p>Here is one interesting example.  The parking lot at a certain high school
<br>
in the south bay (northern California) is (or was just a couple of years
<br>
ago) divided into four areas:  there is the hispanic area, the asian area,
<br>
the white area, and the black area.  A reporter asked a kid if he could
<br>
freely park in an area that he didn't usually park in.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied,
<br>
&quot;I could.  But I just wouldn't feel comfortable&quot;.  A friend of mine's
<br>
daughter, who goes to school in southern California says, &quot;there is
<br>
a fair amount of mixing.  But the Mexicans mix least of all.&quot;  Now
<br>
since Mexican children are soon to be majority in California, this
<br>
may not bode well for a diminution of racism..., or rather, if not
<br>
racism, this tendency that people have to act on their tendency to
<br>
be most comfortable with their own &quot;kind&quot; (however they perceive that).
<br>
<p>There is a biological urge, I think, for people to seek out others of 
<br>
their own tribe.  Of course, when parents are designing their kids
<br>
in a few years, one of the options will hopefully be whether to include
<br>
this option or not.  Others of us may also be lucky enough to be able
<br>
to choose options that enable us to stop noticing correlations in areas
<br>
we deem unimportant or counterproductive.
