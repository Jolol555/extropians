&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve a &quot;Too Dumb to Attend Extro-5 &quot;  T-shirt for me, please.

<em>&gt;Years ago I went to USENET conferences and NEXT conferences.

<em>&gt;Back in the '80's I used to go to that zoo otherwise known

</em><br>
<em>&gt;go to the TIGR (www.tigr.org) genome conference that used to be held
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at Hilton Head, NC until it got too big and had to move to Miami.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the past decade I've been to something like 70 conferences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now some conferences stand out for their speakers.  And other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conferences stand out their connections you make or what you learn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the *most* important conferences are those that stand out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for what you can take home and contribute to others.  For those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;purposes there is nothing better than a T-shirt.  There is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better than walking around in a T-shirt with a genome diagram or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a molecular bearing graphic to get people interested in *what* it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that you know that they don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've got my &quot;Preparing for Nanotechnology&quot; T-shirt from  a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Foresignt Nanotech conference.  I've got my &quot;11th&quot; and &quot;12th&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference&quot; T-shirts.  I've got my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;old Extro 3 T-shirt that I think I bought one of the last of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so it was a size too small (and is therefore shrinking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becoming too uncomfortable to wear).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There have been and will be a limited number of &quot;defining moments&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in human history where we engage ourselves with the vod behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the curtain and attempt to chart a path through chaos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extro 5 will *be* one of those moments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And DAMNIT I want a T-shirt to wear to remember those moments by.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I want something else that those people who were to too stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to NOT be there will be jealous of.  I want something to sleep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in to remind me of who I am and what I stand for.  I want something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that when I go on the antique appraisal show on PBS in a hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years and show them *my* Extro 5 T-shirt they are stunned and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;astounded by it and say that its value cannot be ascertained
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because a billion sims in the solar system would be freely willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to give up their computronium to wear it for but an hour.  I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them to tell me that it could never be put up for auction because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would most probably start a war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We have artists on this list.  We have people capable of creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extraordinarily clever contra-indicatd interdomain links.  I challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you to come up with a T-shirt that I will be compelled to buy a dozen of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and squirrel them away in numerous safe locations so in a hundred years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can still sleep in one of my Extro-5 T-shirts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do we want DNA twisting into Nanocomputers?  Do we want an elderly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(benevolent) vision of a SysOP beckoning us forward?  Do we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the extropians laying themselves down before the &quot;Green&quot; knights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sacrificing themselves because of their respect for consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(sidebar -- carefully having uploaded themselves first...).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do we want to see the extropian nanobots swarming the ISS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a takeover coup to create an refuge before we depart for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nearest brown dwarf to constuct Utopia???
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WHAT SAY YOU?  What do you want your T-shirt(s) to express and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will you make sure you can buy one at Extro-5?  Should we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two variants &quot;I was there at Extro-5&quot; and &quot;I really wanted to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there at Extro-5&quot; so we can acknowledge the spirit but realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at times our other obligations may intervene?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or will I be the one wearing the T-shirt that says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;I went to Extro-5 and all I got was this dumb T-shirt&quot;?
</em><br>
