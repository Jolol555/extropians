FW: THE LIGHTHOUSE: April 9, 2001MARKET-BASED PRINCIPLES FOR LIVABLE
<br>
COMMUNITIES
<br>
(from THE LIGHTHOUSE VOL. 3, ISSUE 14 April 9, 2001)
<br>
<p>Policymakers have increasingly looked to the &quot;smart growth&quot; movement for
<br>
answers to the problems of rising housing prices, increasing traffic
<br>
congestion and other by-products of urban sprawl. Unfortunately, &quot;smart
<br>
growth&quot; -- government policies intended to increase urban density and
<br>
preserve scenic open space -- often reduce the quality of urban and suburban
<br>
life, as economist Randal O'Toole has forcefully argued in THE INDEPENDENT
<br>
REVIEW.
<br>
<p>But when regulatory fads such as &quot;smart growth&quot; find support from
<br>
special-interest groups (e.g., urban planners and sundry &quot;environmental&quot;
<br>
organizations), they tend to gather steam, even as the evidence against them
<br>
mounts.
<br>
<p>Accordingly, more than 100 academics, scholars and public policy
<br>
officials -- including several scholars associated with The Independent
<br>
Institute -- have signed the Lone Mountain Compact, a principled statement
<br>
against the &quot;smart growth&quot; movement's not-so-smart push for greater
<br>
government controls.
<br>
<p>The Compact contains ten guidelines for policymakers -- principles that
<br>
would genuinely improve the quality of life in America's cities and suburbs.
<br>
To paraphrase: 1) Put people's freedom, not government power, first. 2)
<br>
Favor community adaptation and avoid &quot;comprehensive&quot; government planning. 3)
<br>
Let the market and market-based planning, not government, determine
<br>
densities and land uses. 4) Allow market-driven diversity in neighborhood
<br>
design. 5) Decentralize neighborhood decision-making as much as possible. 6)
<br>
Embrace private property rights and common law principles of nuisance, not
<br>
rigid zoning regulations. 7) Avoid government policies that raise the cost
<br>
of living. 8) Employ market-based transportation strategies and reduce
<br>
reliance on inefficient public transportation. 9) Don't forget about the
<br>
needs of future residents. 10) Let facts, not misinformation, drive planning
<br>
decisions.
<br>
<p>A ten-point manifesto cannot present every principle or argument relevant to
<br>
improving the livability of our communities, but the Lone Mountain Compact
<br>
goes a long way in leveling an intellectual playing field long tilted in
<br>
favor of misguided government &quot;planning.&quot;
