This 'mass driver' type machine only fires pellets at present and seems to
<br>
be intended as a weapon. But it can fire projectiles faster than escape
<br>
velocity with relatively gentle acceleration, so, if they increase the
<br>
projectile size big enough to be containers, why not use it to resupply
<br>
space stations?  Lots of small containers soon equal the payload of a
<br>
resupply rocket.
<br>
<p>But I suppose you've got the problem of catching them at the receiving
<br>
end....
<br>
And you wouldn't want anything to get in the way of the delivery stream
<br>
either...
<br>

<br>
<p>PS.   And,  No Mike - you can't have one for perimeter defence. :-)

<p><p>Magnetic field shocklessly shoots pellets 20 times faster than rifle bullet
<br>
For orbiting satellites, equations of state, kinetic kill weapons
<br>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - A magnetic field that accelerates pellets faster than
<br>
anything except a nuclear explosion has been developed experimentally at the
<br>
Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories.
<br>
The machine that generates the field has been jokingly dubbed &quot;the fastest
<br>
gun in the West,&quot; but the description is an understatement.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the fastest gun in the world,&quot; says Sandia physicist Marcus Knudson,
<br>
lead scientist on the project. The propulsion speed of 20 km/sec - almost
<br>
three times that necessary to escape the gravitational pull of the Earth
<br>
(about 7 km/sec) - would send material from New York to Boston in half a
<br>
minute, and from Albuquerque to Santa Fe in a few seconds. A rifle bullet is
<br>
typically propelled at 1 km/sec.
<br>
<p>The machine, Sandia's Z accelerator, currently propels dime-sized pellets
<br>
called flyer plates only a few hundred millimeters to gain information on
<br>
the effect of high-velocity impacts. The data gained can be used to simulate
<br>
the effect of flying space junk impacting the metal skin of an orbiting
<br>
observatory traveling in the opposite direction. The data is expected to aid
<br>
materials scientists trying to balance lightness against strength for
<br>
satellite and observatory shells.
<br>
<p>The technique also has potential as a hypervelocity &quot;kinetic kill&quot; weapon
<br>
that, emanating from a lighter, more mobile source than the huge Z machine,
<br>
still could strike disabling blows through an adversary's heavy armor. These
<br>
more mobile sources are already in development. Perhaps most importantly,
<br>
though least dramatically, the technique is the fastest, most accurate, and
<br>
cheapest method to determine how materials will react under high pressures
<br>
and temperatures. These characteristics can then be expressed in formulas
<br>
called &quot;equations of state&quot; - equations that tell researchers precisely how
<br>
materials will react if basic conditions like pressure and temperature are
<br>
changed by specific amounts.
<br>
<p>The propulsion technique works by applying the Z machine's 20 million amps
<br>
to produce an evolving magnetic field that expands in approximately 200
<br>
nanoseconds to reach several million atmospheres pressure. The relatively
<br>
gentle acceleration produced by the field is similar to that which might be
<br>
experienced in a smoothly rising high-speed elevator, rather than from the
<br>
shock imparted by a firearm.
<br>
<p>Accelerated to 13 km/sec, the plates are neither distorted, melted, nor
<br>
vaporized, as they would be if shot from a gun. When the plate is
<br>
accelerated to a speed about 20 times faster than a bullet, or 20 km/sec,
<br>
the more forceful acceleration needed to reach higher velocity causes
<br>
temperatures of 2,500 K to occur in the flyer plate; this liquefies aluminum
<br>
flyer plates.
<br>
<p>Better understanding of launch configurations is expected to eliminate this
<br>
problem, though liquidation still is superior to the worst alternative of
<br>
vaporization - the result if conventional acceleration could be used to
<br>
reach these speeds. (No power can be delivered from a vaporized pellet.)
<br>
Characteristics of copper and titanium plates are also being investigated.
<br>
<p>The plates are accelerated in the vacuum chamber at the core of Sandia's Z
<br>
machine, the most powerful producer of electrical discharge on Earth. Sandia
<br>
scientists last year used Z's enormous magnetic field to test materials by
<br>
compressing them - a method called isentropic compression.
<br>
<p>In this even newer technique, staggering the firing of Z's 36 lines
<br>
eliminates the shock that melts the flyers at the higher velocities. The
<br>
resultant expansion of the powerful magnetic field is used to propel small
<br>
objects somewhat the way a surf boarder is propelled who catches one of a
<br>
succession of enormous waves.
<br>
<p>A paper accepted by the Journal of Impact Engineering describes techniques
<br>
that accelerated the plates to 13 km/sec.
<br>
<p>A paper to be submitted this spring to the Journal of Applied Physics shows
<br>
how improving the configuration of the loads increased the speed of the
<br>
flyer plates to 20 km/sec.
<br>
<p>The work is funded primarily by DOE.
