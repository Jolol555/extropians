FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         March 14, 2001
<br>
<p>AN ASTRONOMY FIRST: TELESCOPES DOUBLE-TEAM HAWAIIAN NIGHT SKY
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proving that two telescopes are better than one, NASA 
<br>
astronomers have gathered the first starlight obtained by linking 
<br>
two Hawaiian 10-meter (33-foot) telescopes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This successful test at the W.M. Keck Observatory on Mauna 
<br>
Kea makes the linked telescopes, which together are called the 
<br>
Keck Interferometer, the world's most powerful optical telescope 
<br>
system. The project will eventually search for planets around 
<br>
nearby stars and help NASA design future space-based missions 
<br>
that can search for habitable, Earth-like planets.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Successfully combining the light from the two largest 
<br>
telescopes on Earth is a fabulous technical advancement for 
<br>
science,&quot; said Dr. Anne Kinney, director of NASA's Astronomical 
<br>
Search for Origins program, which includes the Keck 
<br>
Interferometer project. &quot;Using them in this way gives us the 
<br>
equivalent of an 85-meter (279-foot) telescope. This will open 
<br>
the possibility of obtaining images with much greater clarity 
<br>
then ever before possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is a major step in the creation of a whole new class 
<br>
of astronomical telescopes that will have an enormous impact on 
<br>
future knowledge,&quot; said Dr. Paul Swanson, the Keck Interferometer 
<br>
project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, 
<br>
Calif.  &quot;Historically, breakthrough technologies like the Hale 5-
<br>
meter (200-inch) and the Hubble Space telescopes have made 
<br>
discoveries way beyond the purpose for which they were originally 
<br>
built.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday night, March 12, starlight from HD61294, a faint star 
<br>
in the constellation Lynx, was captured by both Keck telescopes 
<br>
and transported across a sophisticated optical system across the 
<br>
85 meters (275 feet) separating the two telescopes. In an 
<br>
underground tunnel that links the telescopes, the collected light 
<br>
waves were combined and processed with a beam combiner and 
<br>
camera. In order to properly phase the two telescopes, adaptive 
<br>
optics on both telescopes removed the distortion caused by the 
<br>
Earth's atmosphere. In addition, the optical system in the tunnel 
<br>
adjusted the light path to within a millionth of an inch.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing of the Keck Interferometer will continue for the 
<br>
next several months. Limited science operations, including the 
<br>
search for planets, are expected to begin this fall. Scientists 
<br>
around the world will soon be invited to propose studies they 
<br>
would like to conduct using the Keck Interferometer. Their 
<br>
proposals will undergo a formal review and selection process.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995, astronomers have discovered almost 50 planets 
<br>
orbiting other stars. With current technology, they can find very 
<br>
large, Jupiter-like planets, 300 times as massive as Earth, that 
<br>
are located close to their parent stars.  Such planets are not 
<br>
likely to harbor life. The Keck Interferometer will be able to 
<br>
detect planets farther from their parent stars, which means their 
<br>
reflected light would be dimmer and harder to detect. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique pairing process will help pave the way for future 
<br>
interferometers in space, such as the Terrestrial Planet Finder, 
<br>
which will look for Earth-like planets. &quot;This first light from 
<br>
the Keck Interferometer marks a dramatic step forward and will 
<br>
help us accomplish the ultimate goal of the Origins Program -- to 
<br>
search for signs of life beyond by examining the light from 
<br>
'Earths' orbiting nearby stars,&quot; said Dr. Charles Beichman, the 
<br>
Origins chief scientist at JPL.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interferometer uses multiple telescopes to gather light 
<br>
waves, then combines the waves in such a way that they interact, 
<br>
or &quot;interfere&quot; with each other. A similar phenomenon can be 
<br>
observed by throwing a rock into a lake and watching the 
<br>
resulting ripples, or waves. If a second rock is thrown into the 
<br>
water, the new set of waves either bumps up against the first set 
<br>
and changes its pattern, or it joins together with the first set, 
<br>
making larger, more powerful waves. In astronomy, the idea is to 
<br>
combine the light waves from the multiple telescopes to simulate 
<br>
a much larger telescope. This enables scientists to capture 
<br>
images of much smaller objects or to determine their size or 
<br>
position with much greater accuracy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the Keck Interferometer is managed by JPL 
<br>
for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.  JPL is a 
<br>
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 
<br>
The W.M. Keck Observatory is funded by Caltech, the University of 
<br>
California and NASA, and is managed by the California Association 
<br>
for Research in Astronomy, Kamuela, Hawaii.
