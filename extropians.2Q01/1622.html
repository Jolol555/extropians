</em><br>
<p>Mild style flame: that is quite a run-on sentence.  Coupled with your
<br>
posting in html, it makes you difficult to follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Scientists say laughing improves your health, and general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimism enhances your capacities. Joy is a drug. Nothing but a drug.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One that we produce ourselves, but a drug nonetheless...
</em><br>
<p>So. Freaking. What.  Consciousness and mood are nothing magical or
<br>
noble, they are simply one of the things a complex brain does- with the
<br>
aid of lots of chemistry.  You seem to be claiming that because mood can
<br>
be altered by chemical inputs, mood is nothing *but* chemistry.  That
<br>
does not follow.

<em>&gt; I would be very happy if someone could prove me wrong, or explain this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness-as-a-mere-chemical go away. But it seems that people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treating the most delicate cases of unhapiness (the suicidal) with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this notion of chemical disorder, which, I must say, doesn't look that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much encouraging... I'm asking you to look at this as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists you strive to be, and not as the humane people you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be.
</em><br>
<p>Happiness is not a mere chemical state (although gross depression can be
<br>
alleviated chemically). Treating the symptoms works, so why obsess about
<br>
the underpinnings?
