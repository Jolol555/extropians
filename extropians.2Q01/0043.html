<p>Bertrand Russell comes to mind as an honorable exception:
<br>
<p>&quot;Russell had originally welcomed the Russian Revolution... After the war Russell
<br>
visited Russia with Dora Black and after meeting Lenin and Trotsky wrote a book,
<br>
_Theory and Practice of Bolshevism_ (1919), that was very critical of communism.&quot;
<br>
(from <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUrussell.htm">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUrussell.htm</a> )
<br>
<p>Russell managed to alienate both the Left and the Right, the former because
<br>
of his views about the Soviet Union, and the latter because of his pacifism during
<br>
the First World War and his views on religion and sexual morality.  He didn't think
<br>
much of Lenin at all, after meeting him in person, according to his later reminiscences.
<br>
I recall reading that Dora Black had a much more mainstream left-wing view of the
<br>
Soviets, and that when their marriage broke up, Russell was terrified that she'd take
<br>
the kids and move to Russia.
