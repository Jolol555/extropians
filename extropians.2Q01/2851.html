<p><em>&gt; I often wonder however, if I had been born in an

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You've raised the enormously interesting meta-question
<br>
of how it is we obtain our political beliefs, which
<br>
has fascinated me since I was a kid.  I note that you
<br>
are anti-leftist.  So is Thomas Sowell, who wrote &quot;A
<br>
Conflict of Visions&quot;.  So far, in my experience, it
<br>
has been non-liberals who have raised this question.
<br>
<p>Yet some of the very open and bright people here who
<br>
have just owned up to be left-leaning, or at least
<br>
liberal, such as Damien Broderick and Anders Sandberg
<br>
will hardly shy away from such a question, and will
<br>
undoubtedly contribute in an objective fashion.  What
<br>
is so extremely regrettable, is that many other bright
<br>
people on the left openly denounce objectivity; all
<br>
such inquiries, to them, are simply power plays.
<br>
<p>You are absolutely right that initial upbringing is often
<br>
the greatest determiner.  I think that what happens is
<br>
that as each of us acquires an initial view of the world,
<br>
we begin to selectively incorporate new data into it.  Soon,
<br>
it becomes actually much more difficult to even **remember**
<br>
data that conflicts with it.  And this process
<br>
accelerates and hardens.
<br>
<p>At least for most people!  The most interesting data has
<br>
to come from conversions.  I know of one outstanding 
<br>
conversion:  David Horowitz, who in the 1960s and 1970s
<br>
was a leading American leftist, went completely the other
<br>
way and seems like is now attempting to single-handedly
<br>
undo everything that his generation did in the sixties.
<br>
(There may be examples from the other side of the political
<br>
spectrum---but naturally, I wouldn't **remember** them :-)
<br>
<p>By the way, remarks such as the flippant one I just made
<br>
are important; they keep the fires of objectivity burning.
<br>
<p>On other conversions:  I think that it was Jean Pierre Revel
<br>
who first said &quot;Anyone who is not a socialist by twenty has
<br>
no heart; but anyone who is still a socialist by age forty
<br>
has no head.&quot;  Historical correction appreciated!  Yes, people
<br>
do tend to become more conservative with age.  Whether it is
<br>
that they simply run out of energy to pursue their youthful
<br>
ideals, or they come to realize that their youthful ideals
<br>
were non-productive and dangerous, I don't know---objectively
<br>
speaking.  (Though guess which I'd bet on!)  Now Thomas
<br>
Sowell has his explanations of the &quot;constrained vs. the
<br>
unconstrained visions&quot;, which seem to hold water.  But
<br>
then, of course, I am doubtlessly biased.
<br>
<p>Then there is the geographical factor: people in English
<br>
speaking countries besides America, who in my own private
<br>
evaluation are totally up to speed on everything else, don't
<br>
fathom Hayek and Von Mieses and sound to me clueless on
<br>
economic issues.  In other words, were they living in America,
<br>
they'd probably be agreeing with me, and if I were living in,
<br>
say, Australia, then I'd be agreeing with them.
<br>
<p>What I am dying to know about:  are there any personality
<br>
correlations with political beliefs?  If they exist, they
<br>
have to be mild, but I am slowly coming to think that they
<br>
do exist.
