That was the 70s; this is a new century--and this culture grows 
<br>
progressively more irrational with each passing day. If someone &quot;just 
<br>
did&quot; the test-tube thing today, they'd be locked up. (Okay, maybe not-
<br>
-but surely if they swapped heads--and lose their license as well, 
<br>
which would be the end of imitators.) Do you remember the pregnant 
<br>
woman in a COMA whose HUSBAND wanted to abort the baby to save his 
<br>
wife's life? Some religious group (as I recall--anyone have details?) 
<br>
steps in, files a LAWSUIT--and nothing can be done until their suit 
<br>
is decided (an effort to dismiss the suit immediately failed)! What 
<br>
standing have they in the matter?
<br>
<p>If we had such a person as you suggest get before the cameras there'd 
<br>
be a lawsuit to halt the procedure before he left the studio, and he 
<br>
would die waiting on the final decision. With the right timing, it 
<br>
would be outlawed before the decision. Certainly any doc fool enough 
<br>
to say he'd do it would be summarily informed he placed his AMA 
<br>
license (if any) in jeopardy. He might even lose it on the eve of the 
<br>
operation--canceling the operation.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying this is the way it should be--but this is the way it 
<br>
is. And enough with the monkeys--use volunteer people.
<br>
<p>LOL on the cremation.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Easy.  Tell them that the body *will* be cremated,
