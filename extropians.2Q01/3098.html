<p>Harvest of Fear, yes, that was an excellent and surprisingly
<br>
well balanced treatment.  The star of the show was the Kenyan
<br>
scientist, for she helped me realize that I did not even begin
<br>
to understand the problem of starvation in Africa.
<br>
<p>The anti-GMers argue that giving the rural Africans GM will
<br>
only make them dependent upon western technology.  But
<br>
what is the alternative?  If the west gives food to the underfed
<br>
Africans, it still has an enormous cost by the time it gets to
<br>
its intended recipients, for the transportation costs are
<br>
enormous.  Rural Africa lacks the transportation infrastructure,
<br>
such as trucks, which would be useless anyway for they
<br>
lack adequate roads.  Often supples must be hauled in
<br>
wheelbarrows by hand.  This in addition to the fact that
<br>
the rural African farmers have their pride, and are not
<br>
beggars.
<br>
<p>If the Greenpeacers withhold GM from the Africans, they simply
<br>
allow them to starve.  Since starvation is a particularly cruel
<br>
form of death, the Greenpeacers would show tender mercy
<br>
by simply shooting the hungry Africans.  Do you suppose
<br>
the Peacers would change their minds when the Africans
<br>
began to shoot back?  Perhaps Greenpeace would donate
<br>
funds to build highways into the jungles and Diesel trucks to
<br>
haul food?
<br>
<p>I haven't the answers to these vexing problems either, but
<br>
the ELF/EarthFirst/GreenPeace position seems hopelessly
<br>
mired in contradictions, unless they come right out and
<br>
admit that they are anti-human.  spike
