<p><em>&gt; TOWARD A THEORY OF HUMAN ERROR

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feedback appreciated!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If primitive man mistakes a bear for a tree stump, he tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die for his mistake. However, if he mistakes a tree stump for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bear, he suffers few (if any) negative consequences, and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survives.
</em><br>
<p>#Third man likes bear meat, spears everything that looks like a tree 
<br>
stump OR a bear, lives long and prospers, dies fat and happy. We did 
<br>
not ascend by being timid. I suggest the overly cautious are almost 
<br>
always (sonner or later) doomed--as are the overly incautious 
<br>
(usually sooner). Trick is finding the balance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; John F. Shumaker has propounded the theory that certain aspects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of nature (random accidents, brutality, death) are too frightening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for most humans to confront. By distorting reality with myths, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoy &quot;greater peace of mind and body&quot; and tend to live longer.
</em><br>
<p>#Naaah; they're just trying to make sense of what they don't 
<br>
understand. Once they have it figured, they're less stressed and live 
<br>
longer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There may also be biological origins of human error. The &quot;triune
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain theory&quot; claims that the human brain evolved in such a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the modern human brain actually consists of &quot;three brains&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a primitive reptilian brain, a more evolved but still primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammalian/emotional limbic system, and a modern neocortex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or thinking brain. Under certain conditions of stress and/or real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or perceived threat, the more primitive brain structures tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take over control, sometimes resulting in irrational behavior.
</em><br>
<p>#Whatever the cause, this can of course be overcome through training 
<br>
and discipline. OTOH, lizard brain has its uses...
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conformity is also a factor. In primitive tribes, if you didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conform so as to be &quot;like everybody else,&quot; you risked being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kicked out, most likely leading to an early death. The conformists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tended to survive and the nonconformists tended to die off.
</em><br>
<p>#Strictly interpreted, this would have led to perpetual stagnation. 
<br>
Therefore, it's not entirely accurate. The conformists are still 
<br>
swinging through the trees.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certain &quot;professionals&quot; (such as medical doctors and lawyers)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; command a great deal of power, money, and respect to the extent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their customers are ignorant and error-prone. The economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest of many &quot;professionals&quot; is for their clients to be so ignorant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and error-prone that they often need &quot;expert&quot; assistance, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so ignorant and error-prone that they die too soon! -- the longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the victims can be &quot;milked,&quot; the better!
</em><br>
<p>#Look at applying this logic to government; the Nanny State.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Philosophers such as Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and Rand have indicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that most animals automatically develop to achieve their full potential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans are different in that we need to make a deliberate effort to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop our minds and bodies correctly. Lazy conformists who don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make this special, deliberate, continuous effort to develop their minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and bodies tend to stagnate in errors of relative mediocrity.
</em><br>
<p>#Seems to conflict with earlier--conformists survive; nonconformists 
<br>
die out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Education -- To the extent that the powerful (who seek to acquire the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherewithal to survive with least effort) control education, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to &quot;shape&quot; education to produce relatively helpless, ignorant, weak,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error-prone, obedient workers and worshippers who suffer from their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; errors and often need &quot;professional services&quot; and &quot;welfare assistance.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>#Yes; the Nanny State.
