<em>&gt; &gt; it suceeds and you'd prefer that there be only one you at a time).
</em><br>
<p>This is almost, but not quite, Eliezer Yudkowsky's modified
<br>
version of the &quot;Moravec Transfer&quot; (first described in Hans Moravec's
<br>
1988 _Mind Children_): see <a href="http://sysopmind.com/singularity.html">http://sysopmind.com/singularity.html</a> .
<br>
<p>However, the Moravec Transfer, and Yudkowsky's variant, both
<br>
accomplish the transfer without creating a duplicate.  There
<br>
is a single consciousness (the most vivid form of this Gedanken
<br>
experiment is performed while the subject is awake) whose
<br>
physical substrate is gradually replaced while the subject is
<br>
reading _Cosmopolitan_, or watching daytime TV ;-&gt; .
<br>
<p>The &quot;reasonably good imitation&quot; part happens neuron by neuron;
<br>
after this is achieved, the biological neuron is cut out of the
<br>
network and the simulated neuron patched in, without the
<br>
conscious awareness missing a line of dialog of _General Hospital_.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We had the notion that if an appropriate neural net computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be carried around with one, then the computer would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observe all conditions and how the person reacted under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those conditions.  This observation/learning phase would go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on for many years, creating a giant state-machine-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table, that would tell the computer how the person would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; react in any given sitch.  Then when the human perished, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software would imitate the human...
</em><br>
<p>This has been done by Greg Egan in the 1990 story &quot;Learning To Be Me&quot;,
<br>
published in the 1995 collection _Axiomatic_.  In this story,
<br>
every human receives a &quot;jewel&quot; (colloquial for Ndoli Dual),
<br>
a neurocomputer which learns to be that person as the person
<br>
grows up.  The creepy part of the story is that replacement
<br>
of the biological brain by the jewel doesn't wait for the
<br>
human to perish; it's done in early maturity (early 30's).
<br>
<p>&quot;I was six years old when my parents told me that there was
<br>
a small, dark jewel inside my head, learning to be me.&quot;
<br>
<p>This story reminds me very much of the old (1964) _Twilight
<br>
Zone_ episode &quot;Number 12 Looks Just Like You&quot;
