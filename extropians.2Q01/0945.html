<p>I'm thinking of the oft-quoted figure that the average American watches
<br>
8 hours of TV a day.  If you had all of your material needs met and
<br>
could hit the artificial-&quot;cocaine&quot; button to experience continual
<br>
pleasure, are you suggesting that there is not a significant fraction
<br>
of humanity that would *not* take that route?  One only has to look
<br>
at the strategies people will adopt and the illegal things they will
<br>
do to experience one or another form of &quot;pleasure&quot;.  Lower the
<br>
barriers to that and I strongly suspect you will have a large
<br>
number of people jumping in the boat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tragedies might be useful training for recognising complex (but
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is probably survival value in observing tragedies (or even
<br>
experiencing them) because it teaches one what should be avoided.  
<br>
<p>Nick, while I will admit that some people are complex enough to
<br>
motivate themselves to avoid boredom and find useful things to
<br>
occupy their time.  But I question how hard even we would work
<br>
at these things if there were &quot;short-cuts&quot; we could take to
<br>
feeling very pleased with ourselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did I mention that one of my students implemented a kind of boredom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his neural network agent to make it get out of loops?
</em><br>
<p>They let you have students now?!?  I hope the school gave them an
<br>
informed consent agreement to sign before they got enrolled in
<br>
*that* experiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this is the reason why a certain propensity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boredom is useful. The problem is tuning it: if the buildup is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow, you become obsessive, if it is too fast you jump from project to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project.
</em><br>
<p>Boy, do I ever....
