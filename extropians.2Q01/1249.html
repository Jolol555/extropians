The Quest for Immortality: Science at the Frontiers of Aging
<br>
By S. Jay Olshansky and Bruce A. Carnes. 243 pp. New York, W.W. Norton,
<br>
2001. $25.95. ISBN 0-393-04836-5

<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
------
<br>
<p>In 1990, biodemographers Olshansky, Carnes, and Cassel published a review
<br>
in Science entitled &quot;In Search of Methuselah: Estimating the Upper Limits
<br>
to Human Longevity&quot; (250:634-640). In the article they argued that,
<br>
despite the astounding increase in life expectancy during the 20th century
<br>
(increasing, in the United States, from a mean age of 45 at the beginning
<br>
of the century to 78 at its end), it was doubtful that we would witness an
<br>
increase in longevity to ages older than 85 during the foreseeable future.
<br>
This, they argued, reflected &quot;entropy in the life table&quot;: it would be far
<br>
more difficult to increase life expectancy by curing illnesses in elderly
<br>
persons than it had been to nudge life expectancy upward by reducing
<br>
infant mortality. Any increase above the age of 85, they insisted, would
<br>
require biomedical breakthroughs in our ability to affect the basic
<br>
processes of aging itself and not just in our ability to treat diseases.
<br>
Their pessimism, while controversial, provided a much-needed shot of
<br>
realism in a field in which some researchers were seriously predicting
<br>
that life expectancy would soon rise above 100.
<br>
<p>In The Quest for Immortality, Olshansky and Carnes present their work for
<br>
the general public and discuss life expectancy, the causes of aging, and
<br>
the efforts (both legitimate scientific research and bogus claims for
<br>
alternative therapies) to prolong life and delay aging. The book is well
<br>
written and is pleasant to read, with a folksy and unpretentious style.
<br>
For instance, as case histories of how medical interventions have delayed
<br>
untimely deaths and produced what the authors call &quot;manufactured survival
<br>
time,&quot; they turn to Carnes's own father's bypass surgery and the removal
<br>
of Olshansky's own pilonidal cyst.
<br>
<p>For readers interested in aging and longevity, this small book clearly
<br>
explains the major concepts in the field. Olshansky and Carnes show how
<br>
natural selection promotes health during the reproductive period but
<br>
contributes little benefit over the age of 60. They point out that it is
<br>
only in the past 100 years that most humans have begun to outlive their
<br>
reproductive years; diseases of aging are a recent development. Our
<br>
genetic heritage, they explain, has left us with bodies like cars that
<br>
were designed to perform flawlessly in the Indy 500 but whose drivers
<br>
insist on continuing many miles beyond the end of the race, until parts
<br>
inevitably start to fail. Aging is not a disease that can be cured. The
<br>
authors describe the free-radical theory of aging and the possibility that
<br>
genetic manipulation and antioxidants may affect the aging process and, at
<br>
the same time, decry the often outrageous claims currently made for
<br>
antioxidants. They review ancient myths of longevity and discuss diets and
<br>
dietary supplements aimed at averting aging. They point out that
<br>
proponents of such treatments, in fact, have died at the expected age and
<br>
of the usual causes.
<br>
<p>Olshansky and Carnes also discuss possible scientific approaches,
<br>
primarily genetic manipulation, that might affect human aging, and they
<br>
lay out common-sense recommendations for a healthy life while revealing
<br>
the illogic of claims made by proponents of antiaging treatments. Though
<br>
targeted for the lay audience, this book will provide a useful
<br>
introduction for physicians and prepare them to answer their patients'
<br>
questions about longevity. The authors have an enviable ability to phrase
<br>
technical issues and arguments in clear, nontechnical language.
<br>
<p>Though extremely enjoyable to read, this book has one important flaw that
<br>
will detract from its usefulness for physicians: a lack of references. The
<br>
decision to forgo references, suggestions for further reading, and
<br>
footnotes is unfortunate. The lack of references will largely restrict the
<br>
audience for this book to the general public and prevent it from being
<br>
used as a classroom aid for interested medical students and residents.
