<em>&gt; Define long-term, in a practical sense. Is 500 years too soon for Star Trek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level technology, 5000 years, 50,000 years, or 5 million?  There are
</em><br>
<p>Star Dreck technology? A curious mix of magic physics and retro.
<br>
<p>Superluminal travel, but no automation in battle. Monkeys
<br>
frozen in slowtime as flies encased in amber. No telepresence. 
<br>
No augmented reality. No robotics. Antiquated communication 
<br>
technology, yet no relativistic lag. Almost bare-handed 
<br>
handling of antimatter. Nanotechnology, but still people 
<br>
around. Nanotechnology, but ridiculously stupid, brittle 
<br>
computers. Moronic SOPs. Inconsistent treatment of existing 
<br>
technologies. Random regression from one episode to another.
<br>
Here today, and gone tomorrow, substituted by another shiny
<br>
bauble.
<br>
<p>Instances of magic physics: forcefield, traktor beam, superluminal
<br>
drive, transporter. Hints that apparent limitations of physical 
<br>
laws are just applicable to beginner civilizations (superciv 
<br>
trickster figure Q).
<br>
<p>Diagnosis: not a technology forecast but just space opera 
<br>
for monkeys. Doing lots of harm by scrambling (especially
<br>
young) people's expectations of what is physically possible, 
<br>
and what is not, what is easy, and what is hard. 
<br>
<p>Recommendation: Producers of the series to be the first
<br>
to be put up against the wall, come the revolution.
