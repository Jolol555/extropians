<p>Zeb, I think the general strategy for interstellar trips should be to
<br>
take as little mass with you as possible.  You want to use &quot;matter
<br>
beams&quot; driven by mass drivers to provide the fuel over long distances.
<br>
Lasers will spread out, but matter bonded together will not.  You
<br>
could even ship alternating packages of matter and anti-matter.
<br>
You can provide sufficient on-board navigational intelligence
<br>
in the matter shipments to keep them targeted properly over
<br>
many parsecs of travel.
<br>
<p>So much of the discussion of space travel has always focused on
<br>
the problem of taking your fuel with you, while constraining
<br>
yourself to accelerations that humans can tolerate.  If you
<br>
split the problem so the humans accelerate at whatever velocity
<br>
they can tolerate and the fuel is accelerated to a velocity
<br>
such that when it reaches the ship it can provide momentum transfer,
<br>
but not at a velocity that exceed the heat dissipation capacity
<br>
of the spaceship that is the best strategy.  Divide and conquer.
<br>
<p>Of course this isn't 'solar sailing' so its off the topic that
<br>
Spike was dealing with.
