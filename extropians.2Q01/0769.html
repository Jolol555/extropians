<em>&gt; &quot;'There lie the woods of Lothlorien!' said Legolas.  'That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fairest of all the dwellings of my people.  There are no trees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the trees of that land.  For in the autumn their leaves fall

</em><br>
<em>&gt; green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smooth and grey.  So still our songs in Mirkwood say.  My heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were springtime!'&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Not that I haven't been tempted... and it's an analogy that has occurred
<br>
to me as well... but I must point out, first, that you'd be bored after
<br>
six months max, and second, that all your mortal traumas can probably be
<br>
fixed instantly.
<br>
<p>I guess how fast we take it depends on how much there is to do, and
<br>
whether the interim period between our current selves and
<br>
superintelligence is an irreplaceable experience to relax and enjoy, or
<br>
simply an obstacle to be passed through as rapidly as possible on the way
<br>
to more worthwhile things.  It's pleasant to contemplate the former
<br>
possibility (which I actually label &quot;Lothlorien&quot;, mentally), but I hope
<br>
that the Universe is structured as in the latter - that problems can be
<br>
solved as fast as possible, and subjective time accelerated to the maximum
<br>
computationally achievable, without there being any danger of long-term
<br>
boredom.
