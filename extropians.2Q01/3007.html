<p>E-Commerce Report: Record Labels Struggle With Napster Alternatives
<br>
<p>By BOB TEDESCHI
<br>
<p>OVER the last two years of litigation and recrimination involving
<br>
Napster,
<br>
record companies have made it clear which activities they consider
<br>
unacceptable. Now, for the first time, they have begun to say what forms
<br>
of
<br>
digital distribution they will accept.
<br>
<p>In announcing that they will roll out two new online music subscription
<br>
services this summer, MusicNet and Duet, the five biggest record labels
<br>
whetted the appetites of consumers and investors. Previously, there had
<br>
been little in the record companies' words and actions to suggest that
<br>
these businesses truly intend to create an alternative to Napster.
<br>
<p>The announcements are about as far as the record companies have gone.
<br>
The
<br>
follow-up remarks betray the labels' lack of clarity about how to master
<br>
new technology in a way that balances their business needs with the
<br>
expectations of music consumers, many of whom have become accustomed to
<br>
sharing files freely online over Napster. In a sense, such hesitancy is
<br>
understandable, given that the music business stands to be transformed
<br>
by
<br>
the Internet more than perhaps any other industry.
<br>
<p>&quot;In many ways, it really is too early to know what business models will
<br>
work,&quot; said Eric Scheirer, an analyst with Forrester Research, the
<br>
Internet
<br>
consulting firm. &quot;The questions are very difficult ones: How much is a
<br>
service with X amount of music worth to consumers? What formats are they
<br>
willing to pay for? Will they want ads, and if so, how many? The labels
<br>
have to go out with a variety and see what happens.&quot;
<br>
<p>The recent announcements about MusicNet and Duet certainly leave a lot
<br>
of
<br>
room for options. Officials of MusicNet, a joint venture of
<br>
RealNetworks,
<br>
EMI, AOL Time Warner's Warner Music and Bertelsmann's BMG, said earlier
<br>
this month that they would jointly market their digital music to online
<br>
companies by late summer or early fall. The online companies would then
<br>
allow their customers to download songs or listen to them on the site,
<br>
in a
<br>
so-called streaming audio format.
<br>
<p>But the way the online companies package and sell those products and
<br>
services, MusicNet officials said, is essentially up to them. The first
<br>
two
<br>
online companies that will offer those products and services to
<br>
consumers,
<br>
America Online and RealNetworks, have not disclosed specifics about how
<br>
the
<br>
music will be sold - whether, for instance, consumers will have access
<br>
to
<br>
unlimited downloads, or whether they will be able to store music by
<br>
burning
<br>
it onto CD's.
<br>
<p>A RealNetworks spokesman said the company was considering a monthly fee
<br>
of
<br>
about $10, among other pricing possibilities, while an AOL spokeswoman
<br>
declined to speculate.
<br>
<p>The other two of the so-called Big Five record companies - Sony Music
<br>
Entertainment and Vivendi Universal's Universal Music Group - said
<br>
earlier
<br>
this month that they, too, would roll out a music licensing operation,
<br>
called Duet, this summer. Aside from having a completely different music
<br>
list, Duet's service will differ from that of MusicNet in that Duet will
<br>
control the packaging and pricing of its music offerings.
<br>
<p>Sony and Universal spokesmen said Duet would soon announce the hiring of
<br>
its first executives. But one person working on the Duet project, who
<br>
spoke
<br>
on condition of anonymity, suggested that Duet would offer various tiers
<br>
of
<br>
service, for varying prices, &quot;depending on a person's depth of
<br>
interest.&quot;
<br>
<p>Those wondering about the most promising formats for MusicNet and Duet
<br>
affiliates have found little guidance from the various Internet
<br>
experiments
<br>
sponsored by the recording companies. Witness EMI, which, to date, has
<br>
invested in roughly 40 different companies with digital music
<br>
aspirations.
<br>
Among them are companies involved with wireless subscription services,
<br>
in-store digital kiosks that enable consumers to create their own music
<br>
mixes and put them on CD, and Internet-based jukeboxes for bars and
<br>
pubs.
<br>
<p>Several labels have also been offering downloads of a limited number of
<br>
singles, as Sony does for $1.99 a song. But analysts said none of the
<br>
record industry's online experiments had gained a following with
<br>
consumers,
<br>
in part because record labels have not made many of their better- known
<br>
acts available for downloading.
<br>
<p>&quot;The selection is horrible,&quot; said Mike Farrace, a senior vice president
<br>
at
<br>
Tower Records, which has distributed music digitally on its Web site and
<br>
in
<br>
its stores, through kiosks. &quot;I figure there are something like 10
<br>
million
<br>
songs out there in the world. I'd guess that certainly less than 500,000
<br>
have been licensed to distribute digitally, and it could be as little as
<br>
half of that.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even though Duet and MusicNet promise to broaden the scope of available
<br>
music, analysts said that licensees and affiliates might still face
<br>
difficulties because neither would offer music from all of the major
<br>
labels. As it now stands, consumers would have to go to a MusicNet
<br>
licensee
<br>
for Beatles music, because EMI has rights to the Beatles catalog, but
<br>
then
<br>
click away to a Duet affiliate for a Mariah Carey song, because she is a
<br>
Sony artist.
<br>
<p>A MusicNet official said the company was in discussions with Sony and
<br>
Universal to have them join the group. And Duet is having similar
<br>
discussions with EMI, BMG and Warner. But for now, companies like
<br>
RealNetworks, which recently said it would begin a service by the early
<br>
fall, and Yahoo, which has a deal with Duet, would have to negotiate
<br>
separate deals with the other providers - and then hope to be able to
<br>
integrate the services in a way that would not confuse customers.
<br>
<p>Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, the
<br>
investment bank, said that simply because a consolidation of MusicNet's
<br>
and
<br>
Duet's song lists was logical did not mean it was probable. &quot;I'm hopeful
<br>
it
<br>
will happen,&quot; he said, &quot;but I've seen way too much from this industry to
<br>
expect it anytime soon.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even if they can rely on a consolidated music list from the record
<br>
companies, MusicNet licensees and Duet affiliates must still choose from
<br>
a
<br>
multitude of ways to package and price their subscriptions. On that
<br>
front,
<br>
consumer research has offered few solid clues.
<br>
<p>For instance, a survey released by Forrester Research earlier this year
<br>
said that of consumers who had downloaded music free or for a fee, 75
<br>
percent would be unlikely to pay by the individual file to download
<br>
music
<br>
in the future. Fifty-nine percent said they preferred a monthly
<br>
subscription approach rather than a charge-per-song system.
<br>
<p>As for pricing, those surveyed said they would pay about $5.25 for a
<br>
monthly subscription. Those who said they would be willing to use a
<br>
song-by-song system said that they would pay no more than about 60 cents
<br>
a
<br>
song. A separate survey by Webnoize, an online music consulting firm,
<br>
suggests that half of college- age consumers would pay as much as $20 a
<br>
month for a subscription with unlimited downloads.
<br>
<p>While record companies try to gauge what consumers are willing to pay,
<br>
they
<br>
are assessing how much it will cost to sustain such an effort. Among
<br>
other
<br>
things, analysts said, the recording companies are working hard to
<br>
develop
<br>
technology that is as reliable as Napster's, but with copyright
<br>
protections
<br>
and with prices that will allow them to make a profit.
<br>
<p>Matt Bailey, an analyst with Webnoize, said it would cost a company $300
<br>
million a year to deliver songs from central distribution points at the
<br>
same pace that songs were flying back and forth on Napster's service
<br>
before
<br>
the courts curtailed the traffic.
<br>
<p>Mr. Bailey said the cost would fall 90 percent in the next three years,
<br>
as
<br>
the cost of network capacity, or bandwidth, plunged. Against such
<br>
economics, it might behoove record companies to drag their heels.
<br>
<p>Such speculation, in fact, has helped fuel the perception that record
<br>
companies are reluctant to enter the digital world.
<br>
<p>But executives are quick to defend the industry's efforts. &quot;The
<br>
recording
<br>
industry has taken herculean steps,&quot; said Jay Samit, senior vice
<br>
president
<br>
for new media at the EMI Group. &quot;The difference is, these are
<br>
billion-dollar companies that have systems in place to make sure
<br>
everybody
<br>
gets paid, and building that business takes more steps than just letting
<br>
people steal stuff.&quot;
