<p>Well since I'm unsure whether I'm dealing with the &quot;real&quot; Lee
<br>
(in which case I would say, &quot;no you silly dimwit, thats simply
<br>
wrong&quot;) or the sim/zombie Lee (for whom I have much more sympathy),
<br>
to whom I would respond, &quot;No kind sir, I would suggest you
<br>
think about this a bit further&quot;)...  [The lack of cycles
<br>
available to the sim'ed Lee could explain this error.]
<br>
<p>I haven't read Dennett, so all I have to go on is my
<br>
impressions about what you are claming -- which as
<br>
far as I can assess is that &quot;unconscious zombies are
<br>
impossible.&quot;    Phoooey!
<br>
<p>Lets assume for the moment that &quot;conscious&quot; humans are 50%
<br>
&quot;genetic&quot; and 50% &quot;environment&quot; (i.e. their behaviors are sourced
<br>
from those ultimate foundations).  For the genetic behaviors, once
<br>
I know concretely the genetic makeup of the individual (and
<br>
potentially vis brain wiring that may put a spin on that) 
<br>
it should be feasible to predict with very high accuracy
<br>
what will happen if that individual is exposed to a microbe,
<br>
a crowd of raging thugs on Mardi Gras, gets a needle stuck
<br>
in their finger or the response to any other stimuli that
<br>
generates an &quot;automatic&quot; response.  For the &quot;environmentally&quot;
<br>
determined behaviors you simply build up a database of situations
<br>
and responses for individuals with similar genetic makeups
<br>
and/or life-histories.
<br>
<p>Humans are *remarkably* consistent for the most part in how
<br>
they do things.  Why?  Because *not* being consistent is risky.
<br>
You learn what works and you do it over and over and over again.
<br>
When your database doesn't match the situation you pick a response
<br>
that is &quot;reasonably&quot; close and substitute it.  An overwhelming
<br>
majority of people are going to be clueless.  Why?  Because
<br>
sometimes people do stupid things for which they themselves
<br>
have no explanation.  In case you *HAVEN'T* noticed most
<br>
of those people out there that you assume are &quot;conscious&quot;
<br>
are executing &quot;unconscious&quot; patterns.  When you do something that
<br>
an &quot;unconscious&quot; behavior pattern determines is the successful
<br>
strategy in a particular situation and then subsequently ask
<br>
the &quot;conscuous&quot; individual, &quot;Why did you do that?&quot;, the answer
<br>
is either &quot;I don't know&quot; or something the made up on the fly
<br>
that happens to make sense. 
<br>
<p>You want to consider that the interesting aspects of recent
<br>
&quot;Turing Test&quot; contests are not that the machines are more
<br>
often being voted on as humans but that the humans are
<br>
more often being voted as machines!!!
<br>
<p>It is pure fantasy to believe that zombies could not be
<br>
successfully emulated using a combination of the knowledge of
<br>
the underlying biology of humans and a very large statistical
<br>
database of how humans act in various circumstances.
<br>
&quot;Consciousness&quot; is not a primary determining factor in the behavior
<br>
of the large majority of people on the planet.
<br>
<p>A very clever panel of philosophers &amp; psychologists might be
<br>
able to pierce the curtain, but the average person on the street
<br>
doesn't have a chance.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2.  the term &quot;simulated&quot;, when applied to an entity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     is ambiguous; better is &quot;emulated&quot;, to refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     entities whose mental processing is on the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of a human being's or greater, and &quot;portrayed&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to refer to a very shallow implementation which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     is not much more than the image of a real entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Thus, for example, please be kind to emulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     beings, but it doesn't matter how you treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     portrayals.
</em><br>
<p>You don't have to be kind to &quot;emulated&quot; entities if you
<br>
can determine for certain that they have more cycles at
<br>
their disposal than you.  If they have been programmed
<br>
as moral beings, who will never do you any harm -- off
<br>
them and take the cycles.  That is what natural selection
<br>
is all about.  If they too are pawns in the
<br>
game try to work out a cooperative strategy.  If they
<br>
have significantly less cycles than you, they are irrelevant
<br>
so simply ignore them.  [I think Game Theory dictates
<br>
the behavior patterns here, but someone more competent
<br>
than I in the complexities of that should comment.]
<br>
<p>If its a &quot;portrayal&quot; (as I outline above) that has
<br>
significantly more cycles than you, then before you
<br>
disregard it entirely you need to determine whether it
<br>
views having access to any of your resources to its advantage.
<br>
If so, then you need to be very very careful around it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; History is so complicated, I maintain, that only emulations can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove anything.
</em><br>
<p>This is something we should be able to statistically answer
<br>
in the not too distant future.  The question becomes to
<br>
what degree is the course of history determined by the
<br>
large scale statistical behavior of the masses and to
<br>
what degree is it determined by small twists of the
<br>
paths based on critical individuals.  If the behavior
<br>
of the masses is consistent, as I believe it is, then its
<br>
the small spins that specific individuals put on it that
<br>
are most significant.  If that is true then portrayals may
<br>
substitute for emulations for the masses.
