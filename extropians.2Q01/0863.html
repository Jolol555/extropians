<em>&gt; Courtesy of Doug, I got ambitious today and decided to organize

<p>Cool.  Glad to be useful even as a catalyst.  I've never met Keith, but
<br>
we have acquaintances in common.  Of course, I work with Aleta Jackson,
<br>
who seems to know everyone in spaceflight and SF fandom.

<em>&gt; Some names, e.g. Spike's and Michael's show up a *lot* which
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; two Amara Graps (something I found surprising).  Of course, it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting to find out that &quot;Doug Jones&quot; was an expert on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PDP-8 computers...
</em><br>
<p>Must be another Doug Jones, then.  It's a plain vanilla name, after all.
