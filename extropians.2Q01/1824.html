<em>&gt; Well put.  This is one of those differences that does *not* make a difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many times over the years I have had to remind my digital design engineers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the circuits they are creating just look digital within a bounded set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances, and that without careful controls, the manufacturing guys can

<em>&gt; signals will be mixed with shot noise that is a random quantum effect.  All of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep reminding me that those equations only hold on a scale big enough to save me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from sitting there summing Feynman diagrams.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The main point is that the analog/digital difference only makes a difference in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special cases, and in the big picture does not get you anything useful.  So go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead J. R., add it to the list.
</em><br>
<p>Well, whether or not reality is &quot;at bottom&quot; analog or digital (if that
<br>
distinction even makes any sense), or whether the whole universe is
<br>
actually a Turing-machine program running on, in Eliezer's words, &quot;one
<br>
honkin' big computer&quot; (with simulated randomness provided either by a very
<br>
sophisticated pseudo-random number generator, or by a **very** long list of
<br>
numbers recorded from some source of natural randomness in the parent universe),
<br>
there is one salient practical difference in the real world between analog
<br>
and digital approaches to technological problems.
<br>
<p>It generally takes a lot more **stuff** to serve any given technological
<br>
need by building a digital solution than by building an analog
<br>
one.  To take another consumer electronics illustration -- an LP-based
<br>
stereo system has a signal transducer consisting of a stylus and tiny
<br>
magnet at opposite ends of a cantilever, with the magnet wiggling near
<br>
some coils of wire (or vice versa, with the cantilever connected to coils
<br>
wiggling near a fixed magnet), together with a handful
<br>
of transistors (or vacuum tubes!) used as linear devices, providing signal
<br>
amplification.  By contrast, a CD player employs literally millions upon
<br>
millions of transistors, used as switches in a digital system, to
<br>
achieve the same functional result.  It's only the spectacular advances
<br>
in large-scale device integration and the economies of scale achieved
<br>
by huge manufacturing plants churning out millions of such devices
<br>
that have made the digital solution cheap enough to be practical.  Similarly,
<br>
the phone system started out analog, and only in recent decades has
<br>
moved to digital.  In some realms, the cost barriers are still high --
<br>
ask a serious photographer if ve thinks sub-$1,000 digital cameras are
<br>
ready for prime time, and you'll probably get a demurral; ask again
<br>
if a $10,000 professional digital camera might be acceptable, and you
<br>
might get an answer along the lines of &quot;yeah, but for that money I'll
<br>
stick with by 35-mm. film camera, thank you very much.&quot;
<br>
<p>If, as Edelman and others insist, the capabilities of biological brains
<br>
cannot be explained without taking into consideration the staggeringly
<br>
rich variability of their biological construction -- the squirting
<br>
chemicals of synaptic junctions and the writhing pseudopods of neural
<br>
growth cones, or what McCrone calls in _Going Inside_ all that &quot;organic
<br>
squalor&quot;, then simulating **that** level of biological reality using
<br>
crystalline arrays of comparatively simple, regular, and repetitive digital
<br>
processing elements really will take a Drexlerian revolution in the
<br>
miniaturization of digital computers.  If the biological messiness is
<br>
to be simulated in software, then the hardware will have to consist
<br>
lots and **lots** of diamondoid processors or 3D nanotubes.  Let's
<br>
hope we don't actually have to simulate biology at the molecular level --
<br>
the level at which life does start to look a little like a digital
<br>
computer, the level of DNA transcription and protein synthesis.  But
<br>
Edelman himself says no, that won't be necessary -- in fact, he would say
<br>
that individual neurons would be an unnecessarily low level of
<br>
simulation, and that the appropriate level would be the level
<br>
of neuronal **groups**.
<br>
<p>It seems a likely consequence of economics that if it really does
<br>
become possible to manufacture this sort of fine-grained digital
<br>
stuff (or &quot;computronium&quot;, if you like), it will be necessary to churn
<br>
it out in huge quantities, just like chips are today, to make
<br>
the investment in such complex manufacturing processes economically
<br>
feasible (barring the availability of &quot;bathtub nanotechnology&quot;,
<br>
which sounds a little far-fetched to me).  Then, once the manure has
<br>
been spread, the seeds will sprout!  On the other hand, if Bill Joy
<br>
has his way, maybe the Defense Department will impound the
<br>
technology in the interests of national security, its military
<br>
applications will be explored using our tax dollars, and Colossus
<br>
will be born in (top) secret :-&lt; .
