<p><em>&gt;Nowthen, if we had an somewhat analogous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with extropian poster reputation.  Each person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be rated from -2 to 5, where 5 is a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who you read every post and -2 is you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;killfiled that person.  You would assign numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to each person in the matrix.
</em><br>
<p>I'm very much coming to the view that rating would be
<br>
very valuable for open lists.  I'm particularly biased
<br>
by sci.bio.evolution, which is overrun by three nutcases.
<br>
<p>I'd like the system to be set up so that people automatically
<br>
knew about it.  An example would be a web-board where you
<br>
could click through to the ratings.  Rating on the current list
<br>
would lose much value as newbies and casual observers
<br>
wouldn't know what they were.
<br>
<p>The problem I see is activating social conflict.  First, there
<br>
are some perfectly decent people on this list who just don't
<br>
post much that interests me.  If they got a -1 from enough 
<br>
people, that would discourage participation.  We all want to be above 
<br>
average; I thinnk there would be a tendency for below-average
<br>
posters to quit in emarassment even if their posts were worthwhile.
<br>
<p>Second, I worry that a group may split into warring factions
<br>
along ideological lines.  We've seen some nasty stuff relating 
<br>
to a certain phallic self-defense device.  I could see AI vs.
<br>
artificial stupidity, nanosanta vs. nanoskeptic, etc.  The problem
<br>
is that downgrading intellectual opponents will probably
<br>
occur naturally, be seen as a personal attack inciting
<br>
counterattack, etc., until intellectual disagreement becomes
<br>
personal vendetta.
<br>
<p>In the end I say go for it.  I think the members of this list mostly
<br>
want to really change things.  We see some interesting stuff here
<br>
but in the end it's just a list and nothing earthshaking.  A 
<br>
functioning list rating system could be a real earthshaker.  
<br>
So I'd accept a substantial risk of this list flaming out for
<br>
a small but meaningful chance of solving a profound communication
<br>
problem in the internet age.  YMMV
<br>
<p>Let's see that system, Spike.
