<em>&gt; JXTA (pronounced &quot;juxta&quot;, as in &quot;juxtaposition&quot;) is Bill Joy's new system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for promoting peer-to-peer application development.  It provides a base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for clients to locate other clients who are running the same application,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and some communication facilities.  See www.jxta.org.
</em><br>
<p>Application centric gnutella?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bill Joy is of course well known to us here for his criticisms of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on new technologies like AI and nanotech.  These technologies pose many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats and Joy has proposed that we &quot;relinquish&quot; them, that is, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we not develop them and meditate to achieve inner peace instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet when I look at the JXTA proposal I see no facilities to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquishment.  The system is presented purely as something which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can *facilitate* research and development.  JXTA could even be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on projects which could promote nanotech and AI!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This does not follow at all.  Just because a person believes that some
<br>
technologies are too dangerous to be developed at this time does not
<br>
mean that he belives that all technologies are too dangerous nor that
<br>
his every move must be directly supportive of banning the technologies
<br>
that he fears.
<br>
It would actually be preemptive and presumptuous of him to attempt to
<br>
build such limits into general tools without society deciding what is
<br>
and is not permissible.  It is probably illegal.  There is not the least
<br>
contradiction in proposing peer-to-peer application development as a
<br>
general tool and being frightened of developing AI and NT.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Joy's positions are ultimately contradictory.  You can't consistently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide tools for general technological development while calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for society to restrict technological research.  If he wanted to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent, he would have put facilities into JXTA to allow society to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit its use.  Maybe there would have to be a majority vote among peers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before allowing a subset of them to run some particular software.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You are leaving out specifics and assuming blanket either-or positions
<br>
that are unrealistic.  There is no way to limit basic technology like
<br>
compilers and application environments to only code one approves of.  So
<br>
there is no point in holding an individual inconsistent in disapproving
<br>
or fearing any particular development if they build general tools. 
<br>
Where consistency is impossible no judgement of inconsistency is valid.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joy has thus put his personal and financial self-interest ahead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his philosophical beliefs.  He has compartmentalized his mind so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he can be the wise philosopher one day, raising cautionary notes about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, while he can be the profitable technologist the next, making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money for himself and his company (he is a major Sun stockholder).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Despite the many disagreements I have with Joy's position, this sort of
<br>
hacking at him on bogus grounds aids nothing and simply makes us look
<br>
like a bunch of unreasonable and uncaring utter technophiles. It is
<br>
counter-productive.
