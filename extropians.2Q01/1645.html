</em><br>
<em>&gt; (It is not yet self aware, but has the potential to become so given
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Isn't 'embryo' up to it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But I still don't buy -- myself -- the argument that the consciousness

or
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not of an entity relies entirely on their internal representation; that

is,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether they react according to a lookup table, or according to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mystical other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think 'consciousness' is a combination of things, not the least of which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (a) The ability to &quot;grab onto&quot; the behavioral (director) bit-stream;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (b) The ability to create a sim into which the bit-stream is redirected;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (c) The ability to view yourself as the 'actor' in the sim;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (d) The ability to run the sim forward into future time with reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       accuracy;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (e) The ability to evaluate the results of the sim;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (f) The ability to choose to execute or not execute the sim in
</em><br>
'reality'.
<br>
<p>yup. I agree with this. It might be that I'm too much of a mathematician --
<br>
I still don't see why this cannot be isomorphic to some hypothetical
<br>
function that works on indata and spits out a reaction....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This mini-sim, how is it built? What does it do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have to read William Calvin on this.  He explains it far better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I can.  It essentially involves the development of an internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recreation of what needs to be done to manifest something in reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Imagining throwing a ball, &quot;dreaming&quot; about what you want to do, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>Ok...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What tells you that it cannot be equivalent to some sort of 'lookup
</em><br>
table';
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to some sort of function mapping the input (that is output from the
</em><br>
first
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; function) to some sort of output (the desirability rating)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once you have run the mini-sim, I'm sure the 'evaluation' of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results probably does involve some kind of lookup in your experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table to grade the result.  Imagine 'proposing' marriage to a woman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or for the woman, imagine being 'proposed to').  How do you decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'merit' of the quality of the proposal or the answer?  It isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like most of us have dozens of experiences under these conditions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand we do have dozens of experiences crossing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; street and evaluate our risk of being hit by a car with an estimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the distance, vehicle velocity, our rate of crossing the street,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  The lookup table approach works fine for many behaviors.
</em><br>
<p>But still -- at one given time, and one given women, and one exact set of
<br>
circumstances, I cannot quite see the possibility of ambiguity; once you've
<br>
settled on her merits, you have settled on her merits. You might decide
<br>
otherwise some other time, but then it wouldn't be that exact set of
<br>
circumstances anymore...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It still seems to be two functions; that are composed in order to form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'consciousness' according to you -- so what says that this composite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; function isn't conscious in itself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would agree that 'consciousness' is a combination of the lookup-tables
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the evaluation of the results of the tables.  The process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing 'consciousness', is perhaps the primary thing that babies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn.  They must accumulate a lot of information of what works and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't and develop the ability to use it.  However the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;itself&quot; does not provide consciousness.  Minimal consciousness probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires an (a), (b) and (e) above; then (f) develops; and finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one gains sufficient experience for (d) to work reliably and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is moderately enlightened (c) begins to play a role.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good points though, I wouldn't have broken it down like I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do above, if you hadn't asked the questions.
</em><br>
<p>Tnx ;-)
