Transhumanism. A list of speakers and abstracts may be found below.
<br>
There will also be time for the informal get-togethers that have made
<br>
the previous TransVisions so enjoyable, allowing Transhumanists from
<br>
all
<br>
over Europe to exchange ideas, views and far-flung speculations. The
<br>
conference will begin with a dinner on Friday evening. The talks and
<br>
presentations will take place on Saturday and Sunday. Wrap-up and
<br>
departure will be on Sunday afternoon. Full board and lodging are
<br>
provided.
<br>
<p>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

<br>
<p>Anders Sandberg
<br>
Morphological Freedom: why we not just want it, but need it
<br>
<p>Surprisingly often, personal freedoms are circumscribed when it comes
<br>
to
<br>
the freedom of modifying or owning one's body. I take a look at the
<br>
current views on morphological freedom, where technology and culture
<br>
are
<br>
leading us and discuss whether democracies can afford not to support
<br>
far-reaching morphological freedom.
<br>
<p>Ozan Cakmakci
<br>
Towards truly wearable computing: fiber computing
<br>
<p>A wide variety of everyday objects consist of textile fibers (clothes,
<br>
wall paper, chairs). Their primary purpose is structural and
<br>
aesthetic.
<br>
Fibers can have added functions by the integration of computing power
<br>
into the material that forms them. The purpose of the FiCom project is
<br>
to integrate this new dimension of functionality into fibers, thus
<br>
turn
<br>
everyday objects into artefacts. Initial step is selection of
<br>
materials
<br>
and development of fibers. Into the microstructure of selected fibers,
<br>
the basic unit of computation, the transistor will be implemented.
<br>
This
<br>
is done by doping of individual grains within the microstructure which
<br>
results in junctions necessary for making a transistor. Central
<br>
processing units as well as sensors and memory could be integrated
<br>
within one fiber by the interconnection of transistors. Computing
<br>
fibers
<br>
can be interwoven into everyday objects to create artefacts which
<br>
could
<br>
be interconnected with each other.

<p>Joao Pedro de Magalhaes
<br>
On Ageing *
<br>
<p>Ageing is the greatest obstacle to transhumanists. The talk will
<br>
examine
<br>
several topics concerning ageing, from non-ageing species to the most
<br>
important theories attempting to explain human ageing -- e.g. the
<br>
telomeres and oxidative stress. Finally, I will give an overview of
<br>
presently available anti-ageing therapies and of what to expect in the
<br>
next decades.
<br>
<p>Klaus Sames
<br>
Aging by organ structure?
<br>
<p>While some simple organisms are able to live without age related
<br>
changes, differentiated multicellular organs form complicated
<br>
structures
<br>
and maintain high specific performance on the cost of regenerative
<br>
processes. The study of organ structure is able to reveal such
<br>
limitations of regenerative processes. We hypothesize that an
<br>
obligatory
<br>
mortal state of high developed multicellular organisms has multiple
<br>
organ specific causes. This implies that the realization of the
<br>
genetic
<br>
program of organ development at the same time produces organ specific
<br>
causes limiting the life span. Such causes hamper cell metabolism and
<br>
cell replacement and lead to steadily increasing cell losses producing
<br>
further adverse changes modulated by the exogenous and endogenous
<br>
influences suggested by a number of “theories of aging” like radicals,
<br>
high temperature, toxic substances, metabolic errors or expression of
<br>
adverse genes etc.
<br>
<p>Nick Bostrom
<br>
How Things Could Go Horribly Wrong
<br>
<p>Because of the accelerating pace of technological progress, humankind
<br>
may be rapidly approaching a critical phase in its career. The
<br>
prospects
<br>
of nanotech systems and machine intelligence contain unprecedented
<br>
opportunities and risks. The nature of humanity's future, and whether
<br>
we
<br>
will have a future at all, may well be determined by how these
<br>
radically
<br>
transforming technologies are managed. A better understanding of the
<br>
transition dynamics from a human to a posthuman society is necessary
<br>
if
<br>
we are to develop strategies that maximize the probability of a
<br>
favorable outcome. It is of particular importance to know where the
<br>
pitfalls are: the ways in which things could go disastrously wrong.
<br>
This
<br>
paper attempts a classification of existential risks and threats that
<br>
could adversely affect the course of human civilization for all time
<br>
to
<br>
come. Some of these existential threats are well known among people
<br>
who
<br>
study the consequences of radically transforming technologies. Others
<br>
have hitherto gone unrecognized and it is argued that some of the
<br>
gravest threats are in this category. Being clearer about the threat
<br>
picture will enable us to formulate better strategies, and a final
<br>
section discusses some policy implications.
<br>
<p>Torsten Nahm
<br>
Why Memetics must fail
<br>
<p>Darwinism has established itself as a powerful method for
<br>
understanding
<br>
biological phenomena. Since the properties of systems required for
<br>
Darwinistic evolution to occur are simple, there have been several
<br>
efforts to apply Darwinism in other areas; one of these areas is
<br>
Memetics, and the concept of memes is widely known and appreciated by
<br>
Transhumanists. There have also been international conferences with
<br>
the
<br>
goal of establishing a scientific foundation for Memetics. In this
<br>
talk,
<br>
I will try to show why Memetics as a science must fail, that is, why
<br>
Memetics cannot be successful for explaining what ideas are retained
<br>
in
<br>
a human mind and how these ideas spread in human populations.

<br>
Harvesting Online Societies for Political Economy *
<br>
<p>I think that Massively Multi-user Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs)
<br>
will soon evolve into Online Societies of political and economic
<br>
interest.  Studying Online Societies will require a methodology that
<br>
balances observation, theory, and application.  This talk outlines
<br>
such
<br>
a methodology.  First I examine the nature of theory itself
<br>
(meta-theory), including holism (a meta-theory about systematic
<br>
interconnections between beliefs) and reflective equilibrium (a
<br>
meta-theory on the recursive nature of theory and information).  Next
<br>
I
<br>
determine starting points for our studies.  We appeal to the
<br>
production
<br>
of &quot;spontaneous orders,&quot; orders that are not designed but rather
<br>
emerge
<br>
from the behavior of agents in a simulation, and which proceed from
<br>
simple, normative, non-teleological rules.  Lastly I examine the
<br>
character of those rules.  I look to where morality and rational
<br>
choice
<br>
converge (Minimax Relative Concession (MRC) due to Gauthier) and
<br>
derive
<br>
guidelines for designing rules.  Time permitting, I will further
<br>
discuss
<br>
the basic nature of the Online Society, as well as a conception of the
<br>
player-characters who will comprise them.
<br>
<p>Rolf A. Sommer
<br>
A German Cryonics Project
<br>
<p>In our talk we will outline the technical and legal aspects involved
<br>
in
<br>
building a German cryonics facility. Our refrigeration technology
<br>
company, Sommer &amp; Gölbert, is currently building the technical
<br>
infrastructure for such a project. We will soon be able to offer
<br>
cryonic
<br>
suspension units and necessary technical service. Having acquired a
<br>
mortician's company recently, it is also guaranteed that the critical
<br>
time immediately after deanimation is covered legally and that we have
<br>
access to the patient from death on. We will also discuss problems of
<br>
area-wide logistics und temporary storage of patients abroad.
<br>
<p>Our talk will show that is is possible today to build a cryonics
<br>
institution in Germany or Europe which is profitable. The latter fact,
<br>
as often, is a strong driver of progress also in the case of cryonics.

<br>
Beyond Humanism And Transhumanism *
<br>
<p>Beyond Humanism And Transhumanism: Prelude to a Philosophy of the
<br>
Future
<br>
<p>What is called &quot;humanism&quot; today is but a thin, reactionary shell of
<br>
what
<br>
was once a bold, innovative tradition in Western thought. In this
<br>
talk,
<br>
I shall 1) try to bring to light the forgotten history of humanism; 2)
<br>
show that an examination of the category itself of the &quot;human&quot;
<br>
presupposed in Renaissance humanism is broad enough that it may
<br>
already
<br>
have included the goal of what we call the &quot;trans-&quot; or &quot;post-&quot; human;
<br>
and, finally 3) argue that when we see the continuities between
<br>
Renaissance humanism and transhumanism, we might be able to move
<br>
beyond
<br>
the opposition itself, and that this might constitute the most
<br>
effective
<br>
critique of the contemporary, Luddite form of humanism manifest in
<br>
much
<br>
recent technophobic writings.
