<p>State level legislative action is not that expensive (compared to
<br>
federal lobbying). Focus money on the party heads and the members of the
<br>
committees who will be considering such a proposal, somewhere around
<br>
$500-1000 a head. Then 100-200 bucks to each legislator outside of those
<br>
mentioned, and a few thou to the parties themselves. This is advice
<br>
given to me several years ago by the Chief of Staff for a former
<br>
president of the Washington State Senate, who was a friend of mine. He
<br>
said that for minor issues like this, where an existing law gets a
<br>
rather minor amendment to it, its rather easy to slide stuff on through.
<br>
If you can get high tech industry groups to support such lobbying by a
<br>
former local pol (i.e. an insider) such things can be achieved rather
<br>
easily.
