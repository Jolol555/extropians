<p>
For years I've denounced superstitious idiots for their belief that people
<br>
living near major power lines must be getting injured by the `radiation'. I
<br>
was chagrined last night to learn on the news that a new British medical
<br>
report headed by a notable scientist finds that the incidence of childhood
<br>
leukemia *does* rise in the vicinity of those lines. 
<br>
<p>So far I haven't found this reported on line in the NYT or the Age, but the
<br>
gist seemed to be that this rise is marginal. It's hypothesized to be due
<br>
to microscopic pollutants being ionized by high density fields on the lines
<br>
and thereby rendered more carcinogenic (or maybe more `sticky'). That is,
<br>
the fields themselves do not directly exert a mysterious malign influence,
<br>
which is doubtless what most opponents suppose. Moreover, since this
<br>
new-found effect is so marginal, it's rather hard to see how opponents
<br>
could have known previously that it existed; that is, they presumably
<br>
reached the correct conclusion on the basis of an unsupported superstition. 
<br>
<p>Then again, is that fair? Arguably, their underlying skeptical suspicion is
<br>
that we're unlikely to make major de nova interventions into the biosphere
<br>
without having *some* hitherto-unknown impacts (which of course could be
<br>
beneficial as well as deleterious, but it's easier to smash a delicate
<br>
thing than to improve it).
