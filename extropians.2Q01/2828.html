<p>I think morality is (kind of) inherent in the Universe.  If
<br>
you expand the Universe to encompass logic (perhaps thinking
<br>
of the physical universe as a subset of this) and consider the
<br>
difficultly of rationalising irrationalism, you'd probably
<br>
find yourself at least entertaining the notion that
<br>
rationalism is (axiomatically) Good and therefore Thinking
<br>
Machinery, such as ourselves, is also Good and destroying
<br>
Thinking Machinery is generally Bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... I'd argue that it is perfectly rational to conclude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such behavior is unacceptable, dangerous to society, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be tolerated. ...
</em><br>
<p>Of course, the simple explanation is that morality has been
<br>
selected for, but that's not much of a justification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... There is also some indication that those who feel no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion toward animals feel none toward people, and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to treat both the same. ...
</em><br>
<p>Alternatively, consider that some animal rights activists may
<br>
be suffering from social dysfunctions that result in them not
<br>
seeing the differences between animal and human societies that
<br>
are obvious to the majority of people.
