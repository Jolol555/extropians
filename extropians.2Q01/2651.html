Hey, I'm a techfan, and even I am very conflicted about this. Very, 
<br>
very conflicted. This is going to explode. Maybe not over the 
<br>
lampreys--but wait 'til they get to the cute-and-fuzzies. It's going 
<br>
to get violent.

<em>&gt; James Meek, science correspondent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wednesday April 18, 2001
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Guardian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Researchers in Chicago have built a cyborg, a half-living, half-robot creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which connects the brain of an eel-like fish to a computer and is capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving towards lights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The device, developed at a research centre owned by Evanston's Northwestern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University, consists of the brain stem from the larva of a lamprey, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bloodsucking fish, attached by electrodes to an off-the-shelf Swiss robot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In an arrangement reminiscent of the genesis of the Daleks, the living brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; floats in a container of cool, oxygenated salt fluid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Placed in the middle of a ring of lights, the robot's sensors detect when a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light is switched on. It sends signals to the lamprey brain, which returns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impulses instructing the robot to move on its wheels towards the light.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When all the lights are off, the robot stays still. When one of the robot's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eyes is masked, the disembodied brain is temporarily confused, but learns to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the researchers, Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi, said the work was a step forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in neural engineering. &quot;There's an element of uniqueness in what we've done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly in the fact we've created a closed loop system, where the lamprey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain and the robot are exchanging information,&quot; he told the Guardian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientists are exploiting the immature lamprey's instinct to keep itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oriented the right way up in the water. In a cyborg arrangement, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translates into seeking light.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The marriage of baby bloodsucker and Swiss engineering has little chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conquering the universe as yet. Scientists can only keep the brains alive for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few days and are unable to stabilise them long enough to see whether they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can remember anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But they hope their work will ultimately lead to the creation of advanced,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain-controlled prostheses for people whose normal ability to control their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limbs has been disrupted by a stroke or Parkinson's disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The focus of our work is not so much to create a cyborg as to create a tool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for investigating the organisation of the brain,&quot; said Dr Mussa-Ivaldi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other scientists are already moving towards the practical application of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microelectronics to help the disabled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Atlanta, scientists have implanted a tiny glass electrode in the cerebral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cortex of a quadriplegic patient and coaxed neurons to grow inside. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attaching a transmitter, the patient was able to move a cursor on a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screen by thought alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The creation of the cyborg brings closer the advent of machines with animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts. Advances in miniaturised electronics have inspired other scientists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to develop devices with living biological components.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Washington Post reported that an Iowan entomologist, Tom Baker, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attached moth antennae, capable of detecting the smell of high explosives, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an electronic device which reads variations in the nerve signals sent out by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the antennae when they pick something up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the electronics are not sophisticated enough to distinguish one smell from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another - so as yet the half-moth, half-chip machine isn't much use for its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended purpose, sniffing out land mines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr Mussa-Ivaldi said cyborgs were, in a sense, already all around us. &quot;People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wearing prostheses could be considered cyborgs,&quot; he said. &quot;Some think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we're attached to our internet connections, we're cyborgs.&quot;
