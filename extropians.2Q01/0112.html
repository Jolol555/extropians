<p><em>&gt;&gt; The older they are, the less flexible they are in their thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (This is true of many people, however, not just scientists.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The older folks are also the ones more often in the public view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**Yup--and the more powerful.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes you appear overly concerned with who has the power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This sounds to me like an entrenched and old-thinking perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**Absolutely. Trouble is, it's still here.
</em><br>
<p>In your eyes ... (not mine)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Your choice of words is sometimes inflammatory. If you describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; scientists with those words, then you'll probably find some or many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reacting with some hostility to you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**Hey, I calls 'em as I sees 'em. That's a journalist's job.
</em><br>
<p>Is it a journalist's job to take an adversarial position against the
<br>
scientist?  You appear to have already prejudged scientists.
<br>
<p>My view is that it is a journalist's job to be as objective,
<br>
and *open-minded* as possible and to do their best to get
<br>
many facts and views about the scientific topic under
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>If I was in a press conference with you in my audience, and you
<br>
approached me with a question, and your
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;choice of words
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;body language
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tone of voice
<br>
<p>presented your opinion of:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;**With the possible exception of religious fundamentalists, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no other community as blindly intolerant of new ideas as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific community. None. Nada. Zippo. Zilch.
</em><br>
<p>then I would not be very motivated to give you a good answer
<br>
to your question. If you persisted with this attitude I would
<br>
cut short your question, ask for the next question from the
<br>
audience, probably mutter a few swear words out of range of
<br>
the mic, and then later ask the press organizers who let
<br>
you in the room.
<br>
<p>.. all of this would, no doubt, bolster your opinion that scientists
<br>
are like religious fundamentalists, living in their own close-minded
<br>
world. Hmmm?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;scientist's job is to advance the frontiers of knowledge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(arguably) communicate his/her findings to society in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comprehensible manner.
</em><br>
<p>I'll agree with this
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When it comes to the latter, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frequently no effort whatsoever, or the effort is a total (perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well-meaning) botchup.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody is perfect, and one could always do better. I would like
<br>
to see scientists be better communicators too. But their inability
<br>
does not imply  'close-mindedness' or dishonest intention.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;**Excercise: Come up with a radical but plausible theory which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;requires extensive testing and little or moderate time on restricted-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;access equipment. Your theory must be one which will destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presently-held theories advanced or refined by leading scientists in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positions of authority and power. Put your theory forward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**See what happens.
</em><br>
<p>Many things. However, some efforts may not be immediately visible.
<br>
<p>Even if you don't see things happening immediately, the ideas that
<br>
are 'right' will eventually reach the surface.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;**Ah. Thank you. I agree. Why single out scientists? Because science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a search for truth. A scientist by definition seeks truth, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will follow wherever the facts lead. Anyone who does less is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worthy of the name. There is (or should be) no room for those who go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about this--arguably the most important endeavor of the human species-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- -in anything less than a principled manner.
</em><br>
<p>Scientists are not gods, contrary to some opinions. They are human
<br>
folks like you and me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Regarding 'pet theories':  [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**Understandable. However, some people are &quot;idea people&quot; and can't or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;won't do the background research. Doesn't mean they have nothing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value to propose.
</em><br>
<p>No, I disagree. If they have half a brain to propose the idea, then
<br>
they have enough brain to educate themselves on the topic.
<br>
<p>It's not the scientist's job to be servant to the public's pet theories.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I think that the best thing that the scientist can give to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nonscientist is _not_ plain facts and answers, but instead, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; instill a sense of curiosity and wonder and awe, to aid the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in thinking on their own, about the possibilities of humans in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**Could be--but if they lack the ability to communicate, it ain't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gonna happen. (So be nice to journalists.)
</em><br>
<p>Only if the journalists are nice to the scientists.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; &quot;That's the whole problem with science. You've got a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; --Calvin (&amp; Hobbes)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**My favorite philosophers! &quot;The strength to change what I can, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inability to accept what I can't, and the incapacity the tell the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference.&quot;  --Calvin
</em><br>
<p><p>Then you'll like this ..
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin:            I used to hate writing assignments, but now I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enjoy them. I realized that the purpose of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing is to inflate weak ideas, obscure poor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoning, and inhibit clarity. With a little
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;practice, writing can be an intimidating and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impenetrable fog!
<br>
<p>(poking fun at you)
<br>
<p>I adore C&amp;H. Lately, Calvin and Hobes _auf Deutsch_ is helping me with
<br>
my German.
<br>
<p>I put some of my favorite C&amp;h here (in English):

<p><p>I'm ready to drop this topic, btw. It makes me tired.
<br>
I suggest we agree to disagree.
