<p>Ive wondered about this.  The story about the lumbering C3
<br>
swerving into the path of an agile fighter was simply so absurd
<br>
I never commented on it.  Turns out the morons are sticking
<br>
with that story.  I heard it repeated today by a Chinese
<br>
government official.
<br>
<p>Nowthen please, some of you who have little or no familiar-
<br>
ization with nor interest in aircraft, does that story sound as
<br>
stupid to you as it does to me?
<br>
<p>These people who are famous for their cultural value
<br>
of wanting to save face, well, what the hell is that story
<br>
about?  Do they not realize how ludicrous they appear?
<br>
Do they think the world is dumb enough to believe it?
<br>
Honestly, it sounds like something I might post on
<br>
extropians to entertain my friends by intentionally making
<br>
myself look silly {except it wouldn't be about aircraft or
<br>
spacecraft.  I try to at least pretend I know what Im talking
<br>
about in those areas}.  spike
