Eliezer, if you're taking questions about &quot;Friendly AI&quot; exclusively
<br>
then I'll bow out. It's not a subject I find particularly engaging.
<br>
I'm interested in why the funny rock glows. Discussing what kind of
<br>
airbag ought to go on an imaginary hydrogen bomb is handwaving on top
<br>
of handwaving. Language design, on the other hand, is concrete fun. An
<br>
annotative programming system sounds at least superficially novel, but
<br>
not nearly so deep a profundity as you seem to suggest. This being the
<br>
sort of place one does such things, I though I'd raise the issue and
<br>
see if I was missing something. I don't need a megabyte of philosophy,
<br>
I want to know if you're talking about comments, formal markup
<br>
somewhere short of a complete language, or attaching the author's mind
<br>
for subsequent use by a code inspection tool.
<br>
<p>If you have a great idea and you've thought it through enough to
<br>
express the fundamentals - that's 100 words or less - perhaps you'd
<br>
enjoy a civil discussion. A language built by analogy to iterative
<br>
revision and cross-referencing of cognitive blobs has possibilities, if
<br>
you see a coherent and tractable way of formalizing what's otherwise
<br>
just a neat idea. I'm a student with no particularly grand delusions,
<br>
but I've written an optimizing compiler before, I've got scratch pads
<br>
full of bizarre and exotic language design, and I've lost plenty of
<br>
sleep trying to invent something I'd rather develop code in. I played
<br>
once with coding via a relational database, storing source, language
<br>
constructs (mostly at the function and type level), documentation,
<br>
macro transforms and build scripts, revisions, object files, etc, in
<br>
tables then manipulating and untangling it through an Emacs
<br>
frontend. It got complicated and I lost interest, but maybe its vaguely
<br>
relevant to the model your suggesting. The point I'm attempting being
<br>
you may occasionally bump into someone who's thoughts and background
<br>
are not a perfect subset of your own.
<br>
<p>Anyway, you sound burnt out. Take a rest. Funding is a day job while
<br>
you play with something interesting, you're not obligated to save the
<br>
world or prove anything outside whatever you've signed. Telling me /
<br>
anyone else to fuck off is perfectly reasonable, though you might want
<br>
to find a less bridge-burning way to do it. If you get round to writing
<br>
anything up on code annotation maybe I'll take a look then.
