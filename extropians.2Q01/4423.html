<P>I might start with riding a bicycle, to explain how natural a man/machine connection is and we take for granted?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hi there all, </P>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Through some strange confluence of events, it seems that I am to appear on 
<DIV></DIV>my current favourite tv program, Aftershock (Australia, ABC, Thursdays 
<DIV></DIV>8:30pm). I'm on relatively late in the series (episode 6, the next episode 
<DIV></DIV>is episode 3), so all I can imagine is that they used up all their quality 
<DIV></DIV>guests (like Damien "btw have you heard about The Spike?" Broderick) early 
<DIV></DIV>on :-). The filming is on 22 May. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>The episode is entitled "Superhumanity 2.0 - Cyborgs" (it follows 
<DIV></DIV>"Superhumanity 1.0 - Biotech"). I can talk about that in a pretty general 
<DIV></DIV>sense (I could probably talk all day about it, in fact, family members will 
<DIV></DIV>corroborate this). However, as I've been picked on as Aussie Extropian 
<DIV></DIV>Exhibit A, I'd be happy to represent a more rounded view, informed by others 
<DIV></DIV>onlist. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>So, I'm throwing it open to the peanut gallery. If you were to talk publicly 
<DIV></DIV>about cyborged humans in the nearish future, what would you say? 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>I've got a random assortment of ideas... 
<DIV></DIV>- Wearables... it might be a bit daggy to mention them, but wearable 
<DIV></DIV>computing will be big way before cyborg stuff comes into it's own. It'll be 
<DIV></DIV>a proof of concept in many cases... will people take up the closer 
<DIV></DIV>relationship with their machines, or is the idea of the cyborg flawed in the 
<DIV></DIV>same way as a the video phone or the flying car? 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Killer app 1: Life extension... This application will really pull "cyborg 
<DIV></DIV>technology" into mainstream culture. Already, there are artificial limbs and 
<DIV></DIV>joints, pacemakers, cochlear implants... I think there are even implanted 
<DIV></DIV>insulin feeds for diabetics (better check that one). People seem happy with 
<DIV></DIV>the deathist meme in a general sense, but often tend to speak differently 
<DIV></DIV>when things start looking grim on a personal scale. Contrary to the normal 
<DIV></DIV>pattern of social change, I would expect strong cyborg uptake to begin in 
<DIV></DIV>the older generations, as it becomes available and shows itself to be 
<DIV></DIV>superior to what these people possess naturally. Younger people, on the 
<DIV></DIV>other hand, will likely resist implants/modifications related to life 
<DIV></DIV>extension. 
<DIV></DIV>You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous, 
<DIV></DIV>who delve into these areas... HRT is a great example. These people will not 
<DIV></DIV>label themselves Transhumanists (despite my taunting to come out of the 
<DIV></DIV>closet), they will continue to raise the deathist business about death being 
<DIV></DIV>part of life and all that great stuff. They also will continue to seek 
<DIV></DIV>treatment for things which might kill them, and which are only newly coming 
<DIV></DIV>to be regarded as pathologies. Such as menopause. 
<DIV></DIV>An interesting factor here is that there is, implicit in much modern, 
<DIV></DIV>mainstream medicine, and in it's life extension techniques, the ideal human 
<DIV></DIV>state of "wellness" (similar and related to the beauty industry's ideal 
<DIV></DIV>form, discussed below). The ultimately healthy body is not only free of 
<DIV></DIV>disease, mobile and resilient, it is youthful. Life extension in this 
<DIV></DIV>context is about maintaining this idealised state indefinitely. 
<DIV></DIV>Incidentally, I feel that transhumanism would not take such a simplistic 
<DIV></DIV>stance on life extension... to us, it is all about freedom of choice, not 
<DIV></DIV>pursuit of a mass marketted ideal. 
<DIV></DIV>But I have digressed. The point of the above is that there is an abstract 
<DIV></DIV>ideal state which informs the search for extended life and youth in 
<DIV></DIV>mainstream culture, and that model will continue to dominate, rather than 
<DIV></DIV>our prefered "freedom of choice" model. The ramifications of this in the 
<DIV></DIV>context of improving technologies will be a shifting of the ideal, 
<DIV></DIV>eventually into territory that only a cyborg can enter. At some point in the 
<DIV></DIV>future, I have no doubt that normal, unaugmented humans will be seen as 
<DIV></DIV>physically ill/disabled individuals, in need of special help and in need of 
<DIV></DIV>treatment. I don't think it's a particularly good thing, but it is likely. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Killer app 2: Net connection... In the world of today and tomorrow, the 
<DIV></DIV>greatest change from the past is the existence, and increasing dependency 
<DIV></DIV>upon, interconnection with the rest of the world. Our wearables now (mobile 
<DIV></DIV>phones, pdas. etc etc) are a testament to this... I don't think it's a trend 
<DIV></DIV>which is about to falter any time soon. True wearable computing will take 
<DIV></DIV>off, and the push after that will be to get "cyborg" enhancements to make 
<DIV></DIV>communication even easier... headup displays directly on the retina, 
<DIV></DIV>microphones implants (in/near the jawbone?) to pickup speech, speakers 
<DIV></DIV>inside the ear. Before VR environments (or perhaps in parallel with them) we 
<DIV></DIV>will introduce a whole noisy world of input as close to our external senses 
<DIV></DIV>as possible, and we will simplify output to the maximum extent possible, 
<DIV></DIV>even without direct neural interface. I would then predict that we'd try to 
<DIV></DIV>move directly to neural interfacing, although I'll temper that by saying 
<DIV></DIV>that this will not be the be-all and end-all. I think we'll continue to use 
<DIV></DIV>our external language abilities for a good while yet, basically because any 
<DIV></DIV>kind of direct mind-to-mind interfacing would be incredibly intimate, and 
<DIV></DIV>not the kind of thing you'd want to use to communicate with anyone with whom 
<DIV></DIV>you would not freely make love. Oddly enough, it might also be acceptable to 
<DIV></DIV>communicate with external machines that way too. 
<DIV></DIV>This type of enhancement is one that I would expect younger people to adopt 
<DIV></DIV>first. It will be driven primary by social and economic competitive 
<DIV></DIV>advantage... to have access to these technologies will give you an edge 
<DIV></DIV>those who don't have them. More correctly, as is the case with commercial 
<DIV></DIV>information technology adoption now, using these technologies will be like a 
<DIV></DIV>pre-requisite... you wont gain much by using them (because most others will 
<DIV></DIV>have access to the same stuff), but you will be at a serious disadvantage if 
<DIV></DIV>you do not. 
<DIV></DIV>A strong implication of the drivers of this branch of cyborg tech, is that 
<DIV></DIV>it may well be at odds with the life-extension application. In some cases, 
<DIV></DIV>undoubtedly people will be faced with the choice of enhancements which give 
<DIV></DIV>them short term advantage, but cause them longer term trouble. Some people 
<DIV></DIV>will choose these enhancements. The bar will be raised higher... 
<DIV></DIV>Another implication is related to that of life extension... that it will 
<DIV></DIV>become non-competitive to remain an unaltered human. From the angle of the 
<DIV></DIV>competitive edge in a fast moving society, there is no ideal to be reached; 
<DIV></DIV>it's more like trying to be out the front of the pack in a marathon, or at 
<DIV></DIV>least not falling behind. Very interesting things should come from 
<DIV></DIV>competition driven cyborg technologies, because diversity will be important; 
<DIV></DIV>you never know where the next edge will come from. But, it will be a lot 
<DIV></DIV>more difficult to maintain even the illusion of control over where these 
<DIV></DIV>technologies go. We probably need to get past the desire to control them 
<DIV></DIV>pretty soon, or learn to live with dissapointment. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Killer app 3: Eternal youth and the beauty industry... Somewhat related to 
<DIV></DIV>life extension, the quest for physical youth and beauty will be a very 
<DIV></DIV>strong driver of cyborg type technologies. It is easy to dismiss this area, 
<DIV></DIV>because it seems somewhat superficial, but when you look at the amount of 
<DIV></DIV>money that flows through the (well manicured) hands of the beauty industry, 
<DIV></DIV>a different picture emerges. Our cultures pathologise aging, and they 
<DIV></DIV>pathologise the marks of aging. Implicit in all this is a model of 
<DIV></DIV>"perfection" which we should all be trying to reach. I am not sure exactly 
<DIV></DIV>what form it takes... Brad Pitt/Nicole Kidman? Whatever the exact form is, 
<DIV></DIV>it apparently doesn't have wrinkles, cellulite or body hair. It can, on the 
<DIV></DIV>other hand, have breast implants, a face lift or a nose job. 
<DIV></DIV>There will be a strong overlap between life extension technologies and 
<DIV></DIV>beauty related technologies. One way to look physically young and fit is to 
<DIV></DIV>stay physically young and fit, after all. Who knows... in the far flung 
<DIV></DIV>future, those anti-wrinkle creams might actually work! They might even work 
<DIV></DIV>by keeping you physically young enough to not have wrinkles. Of course, acne 
<DIV></DIV>could be a problem. 
<DIV></DIV>On the other hand, beauty related technologies have more in common with the 
<DIV></DIV>"competitive edge" camp... they have much to do with gaining ground in one's 
<DIV></DIV>dealings with others, rather than the more internally motivated goal of a 
<DIV></DIV>prolonged life. Techniques down the ages (lead face powder, corsets, stomach 
<DIV></DIV>stapling, modern dieting) show pretty clearly that beauty and health can run 
<DIV></DIV>sharply at odds with one another. 
<DIV></DIV>Another point about the beauty industry is that its ideals are, for all 
<DIV></DIV>intents and purposes, unobtainable. Do what you will, you wont look like 
<DIV></DIV>Elle McPherson with today's technology and treatments, unless you are Elle 
<DIV></DIV>McPherson. However, the beauty industry will have a good go at telling you 
<DIV></DIV>that it can get you close. The unobtainable ideal means endless consumption 
<DIV></DIV>of products. 
<DIV></DIV>So, as our technology for self modification improves, and we can more easily 
<DIV></DIV>hit the mark, the beauty industry will move the target. There are some great 
<DIV></DIV>stats out there (The Beauty Myth contains some decent research) to show that 
<DIV></DIV>the "ideal woman", for example, is a physically impossible being already. 
<DIV></DIV>When we add cyborg technology to the mix, where will the collective ideal of 
<DIV></DIV>the perfect form move to? Somewhere as odd as it is extreme, and it will 
<DIV></DIV>motivate ever larger uptake of the sillier forms of cyborg technology. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Physical enhancements... In the cyberpunk literature, people tend to make 
<DIV></DIV>very silly modifications, so that they can look freaky, or have some 
<DIV></DIV>enhanced physical trait. Steve Austin, eat your heart out. However, I 
<DIV></DIV>believe that these will be the very last types of enhancements that are 
<DIV></DIV>made, and the least frequent. In the world of today, and certainly in that 
<DIV></DIV>of tomorrow, physical enhancements are and become less useful than one might 
<DIV></DIV>suppose. Leap tall buildings in a single bound? Sure... but why not just 
<DIV></DIV>take the lift? It might not turn out to be very important to a modern 
<DIV></DIV>westerner to be able to lift a small truck; it might be far more useful to 
<DIV></DIV>merely look as though you could. 
<DIV></DIV>Eventually physical enhancements will become more important, as our biology 
<DIV></DIV>begins to really let us down... we may need to change form to cope with 
<DIV></DIV>overcrowding of earth, we'll definitely need to change form to explore 
<DIV></DIV>space. That, however, is some way off. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Part robot... intertwined with our cyborg advances, will come advances in 
<DIV></DIV>biotech, nanotech, AI (in the loosest sense), and information and 
<DIV></DIV>communication technologies. So, it is likely that we will have some pretty 
<DIV></DIV>smart computers kicking around, grown out of the needs of the biotech 
<DIV></DIV>revolution first, then whatever follows. These will use sophisticated models 
<DIV></DIV>born of that revolution's discoveries. Evolved software, which adapts to a 
<DIV></DIV>changing enironment in real time, will be the bedrock of such systems. We'll 
<DIV></DIV>be pushing close, perhaps, to machines that do something vaguely resembling 
<DIV></DIV>thought. Certainly, they'll make this look like the stone age. 
<DIV></DIV>So, in terms of human enhancement, we are likely to see some very smart 
<DIV></DIV>control systems finding their way into, or close to, people. Tasks which 
<DIV></DIV>take manual dexterity, such as driving a car, should move to become a 
<DIV></DIV>partnership between human and machine, with the machine taking over the 
<DIV></DIV>simpler tasks which require instaneous reaction based on multiple inputs, 
<DIV></DIV>and the humans keeping a high level control. It's human as captain, computer 
<DIV></DIV>as first mate, robots for crew. 
<DIV></DIV>And what is the ship? It could be a car, which can virtually, if not 
<DIV></DIV>absolutely, drive itself. It might be a factory, which just requires a few 
<DIV></DIV>humans to make directorial pronouncements (more blue in the blue m&amp;ms 
<DIV></DIV>please), and can otherwise manage on it's own (hmm, I think this might 
<DIV></DIV>alread be happening). It might be a spacecraft whose sensory abilities are 
<DIV></DIV>translated into human equivalent sensory signals, and whose directions come 
<DIV></DIV>directly from a that human controller's nervous control signals (my fuel 
<DIV></DIV>intake valve feels a bit sticky, I'll wiggle it a bit). 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Part virtual robot... And some of us will end up descending (ascending?) 
<DIV></DIV>entirely into the virtual realm, with the software equivalents of cyborg 
<DIV></DIV>enhancements... intelligent agents scooting around doing our bidding (most 
<DIV></DIV>likely communicating with even more intelligent server based systems), 
<DIV></DIV>alerting systems and autonomous systems for acting on our behalf, giving the 
<DIV></DIV>as yet nu-enhanced human mind a function performance boost, and the ability 
<DIV></DIV>to move freely in a new environment for which it has not been evolved. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Security... People often raise the spectre of personal vulnerability in an 
<DIV></DIV>interconnected world. No one wants to find their robot arm suddenly writing 
<DIV></DIV>"0wned by Kr4XX0r 133t", or that, after installing some IBM human memory 
<DIV></DIV>expansion, they inexpicably foul themselves whenever they think about 
<DIV></DIV>Microsoft products. In response to this, I would say that we have already 
<DIV></DIV>begun on the path to extreme global interconnectedness, and are painfully 
<DIV></DIV>aware of these issues because of problems we've already experienced. 
<DIV></DIV>However, we must not forget that the world has gone on. Most of us choose to 
<DIV></DIV>remain connected despite the risk, because we perceive it to be far smaller 
<DIV></DIV>that the gain. Yes, we'll continue to have mellissa and I love you viruses 
<DIV></DIV>and internet worms. We'll continue to have script kiddies and black hat 
<DIV></DIV>hackers and international bad guys and, sometimes, catastrophes based on 
<DIV></DIV>pure incompetence. Slowly we get better at coping with these problems. We 
<DIV></DIV>will, through a combination of local intelligent design and global natural 
<DIV></DIV>selection, come to be more and more skilled at keeping the computer network 
<DIV></DIV>a safe enough place, such that, by the time people are putting their bowels 
<DIV></DIV>online, it'll be safe enough to do so. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Lastly, I think this discussion can get a bit silly, and will look 
<DIV></DIV>hopelessly naive from the perspective of the people of 50 years from now, 
<DIV></DIV>let alone 100. It'll look something like predicting steam-powered zeppelins 
<DIV></DIV>as the next big thing. There are so many different technological avenue down 
<DIV></DIV>which to progress, and the interaction between these, combined with a few 
<DIV></DIV>completely-out-of-left-field surprises, will take us somewhere mostly 
<DIV></DIV>obscured from here. Personally, I suspect that the mainstream culture's 
<DIV></DIV>"cyborg" is probably another flying car/videophone, and whilst it embodies 
<DIV></DIV>more useful concepts perhaps than those two others, in itself it will go 
<DIV></DIV>obsolete and embarrassing before it becomes reality. 
<DIV></DIV>However, I think that the cyborg memeset is useful at least for a while, and 
<DIV></DIV>I agree with Anders that the tendency to throw our hands up and say "We 
<DIV></DIV>can't know" is counterproductive. Babbage could see the computer, daVinci 
<DIV></DIV>could see human flight, Jules Verne could see space travel. We can see 
<DIV></DIV>transhumanity. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>This whole discussion of mine probably looks hopelessly ill-informed to many 
<DIV></DIV>of you... so tell me why. What's important that I've missed? Where am I 
<DIV></DIV>wrong? Where is my presentation flawed? Don't quietly grumble about it to 
<DIV></DIV>yourself... if you can correct my misinformation, then I'm less likely to 
<DIV></DIV>say something problematic on the box. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Thanks in advance,
