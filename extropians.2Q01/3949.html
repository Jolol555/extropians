</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In the mean time, perhaps we could have an on-site computer (attended,
<br>
at the info desk or registration desk, with the monitor angled such
<br>
that each user's lookups are hidden from public view and going back to
<br>
a standard query screen between users) to do the same thing?
<br>
<p>It would probably also help to have certain designated-open lunches,
<br>
for the benefit of members who don't know too many others so they can
<br>
just show up (provided they sign up in advance so the restaurant can
<br>
know how much table space to set aside).
