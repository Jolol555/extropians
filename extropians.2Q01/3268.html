</em><br>
<p>It is also a sign that we need to make more inroads in mainstream
<br>
thinking. It is not enough for people to have heard of nanotechnology or
<br>
even know what it is, they better be able to integrate it with an
<br>
ethical discourse. 
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>The exit strategy doesn't work. Where are all the top notch researchers?
<br>
How many great researchers can you attract with promises of freedom,
<br>
when they might get prosecuted if they return home, when investors dare
<br>
not invest because they will be tainted in the media by association with
<br>
&quot;evil&quot; and possibly even get hit by bills forbidding investing in
<br>
unethical overseas research? Sure, you will likely get some heroes, but
<br>
the modern scientific/technological enterprise does not work that way.
<br>
To get somewhere, we need a lively open scientific discourse, competing
<br>
labs, investors and the economic power of being part of the global
<br>
economy. 
<br>
<p>In this case, unless the US manages to convince most other western
<br>
countries about this position (and I consider it rather unlikely) the
<br>
effect will be rather mild. But even having to move the labs to Canada
<br>
will dampen research quite a bit, and most of it was up until now in the
<br>
US. A president who listens to Bill Joy would be even more dangerous. 
<br>
<p>The way to fight this is to deal with the underlying memes that make
<br>
people make this kind of silly decision. We need to show why our pet
<br>
projects are not just beneficial but ethical, and why banning them would
<br>
be both impractical and immoral.
