<p>This is why I have a dual-pronged approach.  I go to places where I can
<br>
express my opinion, preferably to both the adversary and the fence-sitters,
<br>
and explain my position in a reasoned argument.  While doing this, I smile a
<br>
lot, speak calmly, act friendly, and make minor concessions to let them know
<br>
I value their opinion.  It has been said that a great portion of influence
<br>
an argument has on people is whether or not they like the person who is
<br>
presenting the argument.  In a debate such as this, where supporters of
<br>
animal research have been characterized as heartless monsters, showing that
<br>
I'm a nice guy does a lot to temper the luddites and sway the
<br>
fence-straddlers.
<br>
<p>That said, does anyone have any references to well-thought out arguments in
<br>
support of animal experimentation?  I have my own, but I'd like to compare
<br>
notes with some references to refine my argument.
