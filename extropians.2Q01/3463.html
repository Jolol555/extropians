<p>Well, besides programming, you could donate time, energy, money and so
<br>
on to organizations and projects that are advancing the Singularity. 
<br>
You could integrate Singularity with your life in the present as much as
<br>
you can and work toward the development of a plan to transition to what
<br>
you will need to be at each of your projected stages and to such a plan
<br>
that might be more broadly useful. And you can  contribute to
<br>
organizations that do this also.  You could become a meme &quot;sneezer&quot;
<br>
spreading extropian memes wherever you can no matter how small that
<br>
&quot;infection&quot; may appear.  
<br>
<p>In programming it is not very difficult to catch up with the &quot;cutting
<br>
edge&quot; of software engineering today.  Especially not since the edge
<br>
keeps getting blunted and re-created every so often and not necessarily
<br>
in improved form.  If you are interested in software then I recommend
<br>
getting the basics that will allow you to freely explore whatever you
<br>
wish and to have reasonable knowledge of the art.  At minimum a good
<br>
computer language survey class, data structures class, computability
<br>
theory class, compiler class and an OS class.  You could cover this in a
<br>
few years at most if you wish.  Armed with this and fair mathematics you
<br>
could follow most software discussions or know where to find what you
<br>
are missing.   Also get proficient in at least one computer language.   
<br>
<p>Mathematics at least through linear algebra, calculus and basic
<br>
probability is highly recommended for following technical discussions. 
<br>
A good survey of philosophy would also be generally useful.  
<br>
<p>Not all of these may appear on everyone's necessary list and many are
<br>
much too elementary for the lists of others.  At the least, if you wish
<br>
to assist, keep up with the possibilities projected for the technologies
<br>
and think about the implications from your own point of view and that of
<br>
people you know.  Chew the information. 
<br>
<p>Read widely.  It is not so important that you understand each detail of
<br>
everything you read as that you acquant yourself with the width and
<br>
breadth of what is coming as best you can.
