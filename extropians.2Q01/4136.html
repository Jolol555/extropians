Somebody wrote to me offlist:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wrote:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; ... early participants of this list were guaranteed anonymity outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list membership...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the Extropians Mailing List had such a clause in the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; membership introduction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, if you ask those members and they agree, then it would be OK
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to publish it.  You hereby have my permission to publish anything I wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the list in those days. Perry Metzger may of course veto my permission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if he so wishes. Feel free to give him my regards if you meet him.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I gather that there was a certain atmosphere of paranoia
<br>
in those days (perhaps not surprising, since Perry Metzger
<br>
is extremely interested in cryptography).  Of course, that was well
<br>
before the Web as we know it had taken shape, and folks had
<br>
started plugging into this global consciousness booster (a far
<br>
more extropian notion, IMO, than that of a secretive mailing
<br>
list guarded against the prying eyes of government spies).
<br>
<p>I've got a bee in my bonnet now -- I'm wondering if Metzger would
<br>
agree to the idea of attempting to wriggle out of the blackout
<br>
on the early posts by, for example, sending e-mail warnings
<br>
to the early authors, and permitting anybody who wishes to
<br>
opt out, and then incorporating the remaining authors'
<br>
posts in the new Javien archive.  I think an opt-out, silence-gives-
<br>
assent scheme would be more practical than actually attempting
<br>
to get positive permission from everybody involved.  In fact,
<br>
I just got a similar privacy opt-out form from my car insurance
<br>
company (which has apparently been acquired by the Citigroup financial
<br>
services conglomerate), that would allow me to prevent having my name
<br>
used for marketing purposes by other Citigroup companies.  I guess
<br>
that if I **don't** send in the opt-out form, they'll assume I'm giving
<br>
my permission.
<br>
<p>Of course, I don't know if anybody, even Metzger, kept a complete
<br>
archive of the period 1991-1995; even though he was the list
<br>
founder, he might, as most people would, only have archived the messages
<br>
that struck his fancy, and thrown away the rest.  Trying to actually
<br>
**reconstruct** a complete archive by merging various partial ones
<br>
would be a lot of bother, possibly more than it would be worth.
<br>
And even of the messages that somebody might have saved in those
<br>
days, to expect that they would still be around is another story --
<br>
50 megabytes was a lot of disk for a PC in 1991, and even 1995 was
<br>
before the days of cheap recordable CD (it's almost hard to remember
<br>
the times when disk space was actually a limiting factor).  Still, even
<br>
a partial archive of early messages would be better than nothing
<br>
(particularly since the ones that people actually bothered to hang on to
<br>
would likely be the ones of greatest interest).
<br>
<p>I'll have to run all this past Metzger if I ever run into him.
<br>
And I'll certainly mention that you said hello ;-&gt; .
<br>
<p>Jim
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>The same person replied offlist:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So much for privacy. :-/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Privacy is a serious thing...  I don't remember the exact wording, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that the list maintainers did not encourage archiving (might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even have prohibited it) for reasons of privacy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, as a matter of fact Liz herself (the woman through whom I
<br>
will meet Perry, if that ever happens), warned me just last night:
<br>
<p>&quot;Danger Will Robinson! ... The people trying to fight for encryption,
<br>
including Perry, have a very strong sense of a right to privacy. Be
<br>
respectful of it or you will get flamed.
<br>
<p>This has been a public service announcement.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sigh.
<br>
<p>It seems like an irreconcilable tension -- on the one hand
<br>
you have people who are fearful of immersing themselves in the
<br>
public datasphere, unless their real-world identies can be
<br>
**completely** concealed, which is something that government
<br>
intelligence agencies, the police, and business interests like
<br>
the RIAA,  absolutely do **not** want anybody to be able to do,
<br>
and which may be a chimerical goal anyway (even if you're willing to
<br>
pay for an anonymizing service like ZeroKnowledge to surf the Web,
<br>
how do you know you're **really** safe from the FBI?).  Even our
<br>
friend Max More began singing a different tune after
<br>
being anonymously slandered on the list.
<br>
<p>And on the other hand, you have what I (in my more expansive
<br>
moods) consider the **true** extropian vision (whatever the
<br>
hell that may mean ;-&gt; ) of people plugging into a sizzling
<br>
global mind, the sort of ratcheting-up of the density of
<br>
interconnected discourse that Robert Wright, for example,
<br>
(in his book _Nonzero_) believes is responsible for the
<br>
upward swing of cultural evolution.  And archives and search
<br>
engines are an **essential** part of that -- they make it
<br>
possible to organize views into a staggering heap of data
<br>
like Google's terabyte Usenet archive that actually make
<br>
it all **useful**.
<br>
<p>I don't know how to reconcile this dilemma, except that I do
<br>
know that when I'm feeling most alive and optimistic, I swing
<br>
toward the latter view.
<br>
<p>Also, it seems to me that **fostering** paranoia can also
<br>
be used by big bad governments and other authorities to
<br>
further repressive goals, on the old divide-and-conquer
<br>
theory.  Employers have been notorious for this in the past --
<br>
no posting on the company bulletin board without permission,
<br>
and certainly no soliciting for union membership!  And remember the
<br>
days when to reveal your salary to a co-worker was considered
<br>
at many companies a firing offense?  And certainly, companies
<br>
didn't want their employees talking to customers or the
<br>
press, unless they were explictly authorized to do so.
<br>
<p>But all the big bad authorities (except for the RIAA)
<br>
seem to have given up (for the time being, at least)
<br>
on serious attempts to rein in all the electronic yakking
<br>
going on.  Have you seen the book _The Cluetrain Manifesto_
<br>
( <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">http://www.cluetrain.com/</a> )?
<br>
<p>But, at any rate, it's becoming clear to me that **I'm** probably
<br>
not the person to pursue this idea with respect to the early
<br>
Extropians' list.  I just had a burst of adrenaline engendered
<br>
by the juxtaposition of three events -- Google's Usenet
<br>
archive coming back on-line, the new Javien archive making
<br>
the existing Extropians' archive actually useful, and the truly
<br>
weird business of finding out that I barely missed being in
<br>
the farcical situation of sitting at the same dinner table
<br>
with Perry Metzger, discussing the Extropians' mailing
<br>
list, without knowing that the person I was talking to
<br>
**started** the damned thing (and I wouldn't have believed
<br>
him -- I would have assumed that he and Liz had cooked up
<br>
a little leg-pulling skit for my benefit, a little snipe-hunting
<br>
exercise for dim Jim.  I don't expect Perry Metzger to be particularly
<br>
impressed with me anyway, but at least I have escaped making
<br>
a first impression as an utterly clueless foof!  Not that I care
<br>
that much; after all, I **am** an utterly clueless foof! ;-&gt; ).
<br>
If the annexation of the early conversation to the archive
<br>
were a soluble problem, it seems likely that it would already
<br>
have been solved by now.  Still, maybe now that I've been
<br>
forewarned and prepared to treat the issue more gingerly
<br>
and respectfully, I'll **still** run it past Perry (very,
<br>
very carefully, as they say on alt.sex.hedgehog.ouch.ouch.ouch
<br>
;-&gt; ).

<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>My interlocutor replied again offlist:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The privacy people wish to decide themselves what information to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publish.  Who died and made agents Smith, Jones, and Brown the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omniscient and omnipotent kings of the world, after all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Information equals power. Power over the individual by governments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The secret police has always had the control over that power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One should avoid dissipating information unnecessarily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; archives and search engines... make it possible to organize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; views into a staggering heap of data like Google's terabyte
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Usenet archive that actually make it all **useful**.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but Google does not contain information that No Such Agency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other MIBs do not want people to know. Encryption has been one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such area for at least a century. This imbalance in information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows the three-letter-acronyms (TLAs) to know things about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody, while staying in the shadows themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [O]n the one hand you have people who are fearful of immersing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves in the public datasphere, unless their real-world identies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can be **completely** concealed...  [O]n the other hand, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what I (in my more expansive moods) consider the **true** extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vision... of people plugging into a sizzling global mind...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The latter view works when there exists a balanced access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. As long as there exists secret agencies who spy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on everybody else, they will have the control over information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also, it seems to me that **fostering** paranoia can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be used by big bad governments and other authorities to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; further repressive goals, on the old divide-and-conquer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory.  Employers have been notorious for this in the past...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting insights in U.S. corporational culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other parts of this planet have government oppression to consider.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here, for example, we have central registers on all citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everybody has a personal number which appears on all IDs, driver's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; licenses, government forms, bank accounts, etc. You cannot hide if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you leave traces of yourself in the data sphere around here. So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions is to not do that.
</em><br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>It seems that feeling about the 1991-1995 privacy agreement
<br>
still runs strong.  I wonder if early posts could be cleared
<br>
by **content** -- e.g., excluding discussions of cryptography
<br>
and other sensitive (potentially incriminating) topics?
