<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see how this makes a difference; do you define consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as somehow being fundamentally different than intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a causal color detecting machine at the local paint store
<br>
is more intelligent, color wise, than we are.  Some day causal
<br>
machines will be more intelligent than our brain is in the same way.
<br>
But I think or predict this is missing the most important point about
<br>
conscious knowledge - and that is what it is phenomenally like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So?  I don't grasp the importance.  Interesting perhaps, but I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it as anything more than a secondary effect.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big part of our conscious intelligence is our conscious
<br>
knowledge, it's phenomenal nature, and the way it is all unified into
<br>
the (spiritual if you will) world of everything we consciously
<br>
know. You know that red represents 700 nm light.  If you saw a page
<br>
with 1 million small numbers on it, each indicating the numerical
<br>
value of that pixel's color, you would know what the picture contains.
<br>
That is about all a causal computer of today knows of pictures.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phenomenal magic occurs when you turn these numbers into
<br>
qualia and put them all together in a conscious 3D spirit world.
<br>
We'll be able to make progress with today's causal technology, but I
<br>
predict once we discover how to represent knowledge in phenomenal
<br>
spirit worlds, artificial intelligences will take a quantum leap
<br>
forward.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine having color receptors added to your eye so you could
<br>
see beyond infrared.  Imagine mapping that color to a blue qualia so
<br>
when you see a rainbow, it would be wider and now have two blue
<br>
stripes.  But that's not near as great as discovering some other yet
<br>
to be experienced color qualia and using it to represent infrared
<br>
rather than repeatedly using blue in your 3D conscious world.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can know all that goes on in a compiler.  But that kind of
<br>
knowledge isn't all that useful to me.  Until that knowledge is
<br>
represented in a vast, complex and phenomenally conscious way, more
<br>
than just &quot;seeing it all real time&quot; that kind of sub conscious
<br>
knowledge isn't worth much.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we can really grow in intelligence, the vastness and
<br>
complexity of our &quot;spirit worlds&quot; or what our brains can consciously
<br>
know must be greatly increased.  Who cares about the difference
<br>
between 700 and 500 nm light?  But the difference between red and
<br>
green!?  Now that is something I want to really objectively know
<br>
about.  I predict that when science discovers this, it will be much
<br>
more than just &quot;interesting perhaps&quot;, it will be the greatest
<br>
scientific discovery to date, if not of all time.  Untill we make that
<br>
discovery, we still don't really know what we are and what it means to
<br>
say: &quot;I [consciously] think, therefor I am&quot; and what is required to re
<br>
make or increase ourselves.
