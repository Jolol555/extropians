This actually fits in with something I noticed, though I'll keep it short
<br>
as I'm not sure it's so connected to extropian ideas directly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm 33, and most of the people of my generation I know do see
<br>
differences in race, but most struggle not to let it affect their thinking.
<br>
Most of the people I know personally have older relatives who are at least
<br>
somewhat racist, so you grow up listening to this junk, and then struggling
<br>
with it later in life when you realize it simply isn't true.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I've got some cousins who are 18 or 19, and they don't even
<br>
seem to really notice color, except when they confront it as racism, which
<br>
at least one actively works against. (He's involved in some anti-racist
<br>
organizations)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since (I think he mentioned this once) Elizier seems to be closer in
<br>
age to them than me, he seems to think it's a non-issue which will go away
<br>
if left alone. Normally, I'd simply tell him he's wrong, and these issues
<br>
have to be opposed, but he may not be. If the people who are racist grow
<br>
old and die, and their children are exposed to more people who don't think
<br>
it's an issue, it might just die out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind you, it's more complex, since there will likely always be people
<br>
with these memes, and some of them will be virulent enough to spread
<br>
anyway, but I think you see my point. My cousins have a different
<br>
background than I did, but I see it a lot in things like interracial
<br>
dating, which seems to be a non-issue for teens now, when I know it was a
<br>
huge deal when I was a teen in the 80's.
