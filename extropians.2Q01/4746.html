<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Further resuscitation advancements: AMA briefing proposes cooling patients
<br>
<p>At a Heart Disease Media Briefing held by the American Medical Association
<br>
on May 10, Lance B Becker, MD, Director of the Emergency Resuscitation
<br>
Research Center at the University of Chicago and Argonne National
<br>
Laboratory in Argonne Illinois, announced that cooling the heart and brain
<br>
of heart attack patients could prevent up to half of their fatalities.  Dr
<br>
Becker's research arose from his observation that restarting stopped
<br>
hearts may be effective if attempted within a few minutes of cardiac
<br>
arrest, but after a longer period reperfusion injury results.  Precursors
<br>
to free radicals build up in the heart and brain, and after resuscitation,
<br>
oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the tissues, resulting in a large
<br>
amount of damaging free radical activity.   Dr Becker commented,
<br>
&quot;Restarting hearts is what I try to do every day in the emergency room and
<br>
it works fantastically well if it is accomplished in 3 to 4 minutes after
<br>
the patient collapses. But the patients we typically see are not so lucky
<br>
- they have had too long a time period without blood flow; about 90
<br>
percent of those patients die even after I've successfully restarted their
<br>
hearts. They die from an injury that is different than the cardiac arrest
<br>
that originally stopped the heart. We are just beginning to learn that the
<br>
cause of death appears to be a form of injury that is, in some part, due
<br>
to the way we resuscitate the person.  It appears that significant
<br>
additional damage takes place during the time when we rapidly reintroduce
<br>
oxygen and nutrients back into the cells and stimulate the heart to beat.
<br>
This is called reperfusion injury - and it may be possible to avoid this
<br>
and still eventually restart the heart. But we may need to give the heart
<br>
a rest.&quot;
<br>
<p>That rest is accomplished by rapidly cooling the heart and brain.  One of
<br>
the treatments being developed puts patients into stasis, described as a
<br>
state of lowered heart rate and body function accomplished by decreasing
<br>
the core body temperature instead of immediately attempting to restart the
<br>
heart.  Artificial circulation is then maintained by a cardiac bypass
<br>
machine.  Allowing a regeneration period would permit a return to normal
<br>
physiology when the patient is rewarmed and the heart restarted, and
<br>
provide greater tissue recovery due to the cells being able to devote
<br>
their energy toward repair.
<br>
<p>Dr Becker described the process: &quot;A new technology for human cooling is
<br>
being developed at the University of Chicago and Argonne National
<br>
Laboratory based on a new phase-change microparticulate ice slurry
<br>
technology that looks promising at least in the theoretical sense.  One of
<br>
the coolant slurries we are working with is based on perfluorocarbon, a
<br>
liquid that can deliver oxygen to the lungs. .  . . We aim to make these
<br>
coolants biologically compatible and we have done some preliminary animal
<br>
testing which suggests we are on the right track.  In the future,
<br>
paramedics might administer this slurry coolant through a breathing tube
<br>
to patients in cardiac arrest to cool the heart and brain rapidly. If we
<br>
can introduce something cold and non-toxic into the lungs of sudden death
<br>
victims, then when you do cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the blood
<br>
cooled in the lungs is pumped first to the heart and then into brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I predict that in the future we will simply not immediately restart the
<br>
heart when a person has suffered prolonged lack of blood flow. Instead,
<br>
our paramedics will rapidly cool patients and put them into a stasis
<br>
state. . . . Most importantly, with research funding these methods can be
<br>
developed right now and I cannot imagine how we can fail to invest in
<br>
science to save people's lives. We lose approximately 1,000 lives a day in
<br>
our country to sudden unexpected death, and the true tragedy is that with
<br>
the appropriate therapy, we could save around 50 percent of those people.
<br>
Right now our national survival rate is below 5 percent. We are all guilty
<br>
of tolerating a lot of unnecessary deaths.&quot;
<br>
<p>ANTIAGING RESEARCH FUNDED BY LIFE EXTENSION FOUNDATION
<br>
<p>Many people who need a heart transplant fail to receive one because there
<br>
is only a limited number of hearts available. One reason for this is the
<br>
limited time that a heart can remain viable after it is removed from the
<br>
donor. The Life Extension Foundation is funding two research projects at
<br>
the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York to develop better
<br>
methods of organ preservation so that more hearts will be available for
<br>
transplant. The Foundation is also funding similar research to improve
<br>
kidney preservation at 21st Century Medicine laboratory in Southern
<br>
California.
<br>
<p>A breakthrough made at The Foundation's Critical Care Research laboratory
<br>
is an Automated Liquid Ventilation System that lowers whole-body
<br>
temperature extremely rapidly by introducing cooled liquid perflurocarbon
<br>
into the lungs without causing lasting injury. The kind of rapidly-induced
<br>
hypothermia that's possible with this liquid ventilation system could save
<br>
the lives of large numbers of people who suffer heart attacks, strokes or
<br>
severe closed head injuries. The system could also be used in-hospital to
<br>
give doctors extra time to perform heavy-duty surgical procedures without
<br>
risking permanent brain damage.
<br>
<p>At The Foundation's 21st Century Medicine laboratory, advanced methods are
<br>
being developed to supercool and vitrify cells, tissues and organs for
<br>
medical uses, such as kidney, heart, cornea and liver transplantation. The
<br>
leader of this project is Dr. Gregory M. Fahy, the world's foremost
<br>
cryopreservation expert, who formerly worked in the American Red Cross
<br>
research laboratory in Maryland. Dr. Fahy and Dr. Brian Wowk are the
<br>
leading experts on ice control. Using research funding provided by The
<br>
Foundation, Drs. Fahy and Wowk have found agents that block the formation
<br>
of ice in concentrations as low as one part per million. The main goal of
<br>
this research is to demonstrate that it is possible to cool entire organs
<br>
to cryogenic temperatures, store them as long as may be desired, warm them
<br>
back up, and show that they can function properly in the body.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Atherosclerosis
<br>
<p>Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death and impairment in America
<br>
today. It is estimated that 1,100,000 new or recurrent coronary attacks
<br>
occur per year in America. It affects close to 60 million Americans. To
<br>
better place this disease in perspective, every 20 seconds a person in the
<br>
United States has a heart attack, and one third of these attacks lead to
<br>
death. Moreover, 50% of Americans have levels of cholesterol that place
<br>
them at high risk of coronary artery disease, and cholesterol is only one
<br>
factor that causes the occlusion of arteries that is technically known as
<br>
atherosclerosis.
<br>
<p>The B vitamin niacin, also known as nicotinic acid, has been used for many
<br>
years in relatively high doses (e.g., 1 to 4.5 grams/day) as an
<br>
inexpensive treatment for hyperlipidemia, a condition characterized by
<br>
elevated blood levels of cholesterol and/ or triglycerides (fats). High
<br>
concentrations of these fatty compounds are associated with increased risk
<br>
of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent research indicates that, in
<br>
addition to reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels, nicotinic acid
<br>
treatment also significantly increases the concentration of high-density
<br>
lipoproteins (HDL), the &quot;good&quot; form of cholesterol associated with reduced
<br>
risk of CHD.
<br>
<p>As early as 1939 scientists discovered that artichoke may have favorable
<br>
effects on arteriosclerosis and heart disease in general. Subsequent
<br>
studies in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s supported the possible benefits of
<br>
artichoke extract. In a 1996 double-blind study conducted by Petrowicz,
<br>
the cholesterol-lowering effect of artichoke leaf extract was studied on
<br>
44 healthy individuals under strictly controlled conditions, resulting in
<br>
a significant decrease in cholesterol levels in those individuals who had
<br>
the highest starting levels of cholesterol, further documenting the
<br>
potential benefits of artichoke extract relative to lowering of
<br>
cholesterol.
