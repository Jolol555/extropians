Courtesy of Doug, I got ambitious today and decided to organize
<br>
a reference page for H. Keith Henson.  You may find it at:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Engineering/Henson-HK/">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Engineering/Henson-HK/</a>
<br>
<p>I've even converted several of the old grungy text documents that
<br>
I managed to find to hypertext (I can't believe we once actually
<br>
read this stuff).  Interestingly several of these were lifted from
<br>
pointers to Anders' archives (Is there anything Anders doesn't have?)
<br>
<p>Now, why is Keith the 2nd most famous extropian?  Well I'm
<br>
not doing any &quot;filtering&quot; for identity homonyms.  But it
<br>
would appear that from Google's point of view:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anders &gt; Keith &gt; Max &gt; Damien &gt;&gt; yours truly or Greg
<br>
<p>Some names, e.g. Spike's and Michael's show up a *lot* which
<br>
I assume is due to the probability that they wear multiple hats
<br>
around the world.  And there are definitely seems to be at least
<br>
two Amara Graps (something I found surprising).  Of course, it was
<br>
interesting to find out that &quot;Doug Jones&quot; was an expert on
<br>
PDP-8 computers...
<br>
<p>Now, if one of our young computer literate people can figure
<br>
out how to take the results of these searches and separate
<br>
them into distinct domains of high similarity, we could resolve
<br>
these questions defininitively...
<br>
<p>If anyone has any interesting ancecdotes, embarassing photographs,
<br>
historical facts, additional writings, links, etc. that they think
<br>
should be added to the H.K. Henson page, please forward such to me.
<br>
<p>If there is a lesson to be learned here -- if you want
<br>
to be &quot;famous&quot; take on a &quot;religion&quot; or two....
<br>
<p>One thing that is rather striking is how close Anders comes
<br>
to Ralph Merkle and even Eric Drexler (and he hasn't even
<br>
got a PhD after his name yet...).
<br>
<p>Just a thought regarding Extro5 -- given the recent discussion
<br>
regarding simulations and ancestor recreations -- should there
<br>
be an after-hours video recording session where people spill
<br>
their guts to allow the recreation of more accurate simulations?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Robert
