<p>World's oldest computer rises again
<br>
<p>Researchers in Berlin, Germany have built a reproduction of the first
<br>
freely programmable computer, originally constructed by engineer Konrad Zuse   
<br>
in the year 1941. The replica will be presented the day after tomorrow, on the
<br>
60th anniversary of the &quot;Z3.&quot; In May 1941, completely unbeknownst to the
<br>
general public, Konrad Zuse had fulfilled his dream of an automatic computing
<br>
machine and rung in the Age of Computers.
<br>
<p>The inventor had built the Z3 using 2,500 phone relays in his apartment
<br>
in Berlin. The machine was capable of carrying out any combination of basic
<br>
arithmetical operations, and had memory for 64 numbers. The original was
<br>
destroyed in 1943, during the war.
<br>
<p>The researchers say they built the replica of the Z3 using smaller
<br>
relays. They constructed the machine's architecture such that the flow of data is
<br>
shown by tiny light-emitting diodes. Thus, the replica is both historically
<br>
accurate while also being suitable for bringing the history of machines
<br>
to life for schoolchildren and students. The model has been scaled down so
<br>
that it can be shown at various exhibits and in museums in future. A 1:1
<br>
reconstruction was built in the 1960s by Konrad Zuse himself, and is
<br>
housed in Munich's Deutsches Museum.
