<p>Tragedy is popular in part because in viewing it, you feel better because
<br>
it isn't happening to you.  This is a corollary of my &quot;Bad news is good
<br>
news if it isn't happening to you&quot; theory and explains why most of the
<br>
news one sees on TV or in the press happens to be &quot;bad news&quot;.
<br>
<p>However the other part of this &quot;if life was all happiness, people would become
<br>
bored&quot; raises interesting issues.  I get bored very easily which explains
<br>
why I go in so many directions at once, to my own detriment sometimes.
<br>
Anders and others seem to be much better at managing to channel their
<br>
boredom than I.  When there are no &quot;survival&quot; problems however, learning
<br>
to creatively develop interesting problems for yourself and then work though
<br>
solving them is going to be a major area of emphasis.  But hey, if the
<br>
Reinmann Hypothesis can survive a century or so without a proof, I
<br>
suspect there are lots of things that one can find to entertain oneself.
