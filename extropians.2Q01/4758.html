<em>&gt; [Zero Powers doubts]... that even those who regard the &quot;slow singularity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario as silly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (whoever that faction may be) expect us to leap from 20th Century tech to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strong AI in the course of a day or two.  Now *that's* what I'd call silly.

<p>The term &quot;slow&quot; is not really what I was getting at.  AI will be plenty
<br>
fast as far as that goes, but we need to deal with other axes besides
<br>
speed and friendliness, such as ambition.  I can imagine a Singularity
<br>
that is fast enough to restructure existing computing hardware in a day,
<br>
and have the theoretical ability to do strong drextech, but be strangely
<br>
lacking in what we would call desire.  Like a chess program, the
<br>
Singularity might be perfectly content to just compute whatever it is
<br>
asked to compute.  It may have no ambition to upload humans or
<br>
expand itself in ways that seem so natural to species which prospered
<br>
by successfully  competing for survival.  An AI that arose in such a
<br>
manner might have no survival instinct, no urge to preserve itself, a trait
<br>
which is universal in species that evolved by natural selection.
<br>
<p>An AI might invent itself in such a way that is neither friendly nor
<br>
unfriendly to humans, but rather indifferent.  An AI *might* invent
<br>
itself in such a way that it really doesn't *want* to rule to universe,
<br>
even if it could.  spike
