<em>&gt; &gt;B.3.1 What is the difference between private property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and possession?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Anarchists define &quot;private property&quot; (or just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;property,&quot; for short) as state-protected monopolies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of certain objects or privileges which are used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;exploit others. &quot;Possession,&quot; on the other hand, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ownership of things that are not used to exploit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;others (e.g. a car, a refrigerator, a toothbrush,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I should point out that this left-anarchist definition of &quot;property&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being defined in terms of an equally tricky concept of &quot;exploitation,&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the term &quot;monopoly&quot; is used here in a very odd sense with little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection to its use in the economic literature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The economically meaningful definition of a monopoly is: a situation where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a monopolist &quot;can secure higher net proceeds by selling a smaller quantity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his product at a higher price than by selling a greater quantity at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower price.&quot; (von Mises, _Human Action_, XV.6)  It does not mean simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private control over a commodity.  I can own a number of houses and rent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them out, but (whether my ownership is protected by a national government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a private defense agency, or just by me and my family with lots of
</em><br>
guns)
<br>
<em>&gt; I won't be able to significantly increase the market price of housing by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boarding up some of my own houses, and therefore all of my supply will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made available at the market rate.  The concept of monopoly used here is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any sort of protected claim of ownership to something that is a factor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production rather than a personal consumptive item, IOW &quot;property.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I even find von Mises definition a bit problematic.  Granted, it's closer to
<br>
how most economists and most people use the term, but I find Rothbard's of
<br>
&quot;a grant of special privilige from the State reserving a certain area of
<br>
production to one particular individual or group.&quot;  (See &quot;A Critique of
<br>
Neoclassical and Austrian Monopoly Theory&quot; by D. T. Armentano in _New
<br>
Directions in Austrian Economics_, Louis M. Spadaro, editor.)  Note the
<br>
&quot;area of production&quot; in Rothbard's definition -- Rothbard was a
<br>
capitalist-anarchist -- rules out private property as necessarily
<br>
monopolistic.
<br>
<p>In a sense too, the widening of the definition of monopoly that is being
<br>
used here can be extended to anything.  Each person, after all, has a
<br>
monopoly in the previous usage of the term over his or her labor and person.
<br>
Is, e.g., an employee exploiting the employer when he or she only rents out
<br>
the use of his or her skills?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Left-anarchists feel they can make this distinction between &quot;possessions&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;property&quot; because they don't understand the productive role played by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wise alignment of capital by entrepreneurs.  What a left-anarchist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls &quot;exploitation&quot; is really just making wealth by correctly deciding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what most needs to get done rather than by doing the getting-done.  But
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; former is just an example of the latter, a skill that happens to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceedingly rare and therefore carries a high price.
</em><br>
<p>I think this problem is not restricted to Left-anarchists.  It's a much
<br>
wider problem with the way some look at all sorts of activities.  We see it
<br>
when people shake their fists at someone making a killing through some
<br>
nonfraudulent investment vehicle, such as futures contracts, mutual funds,
<br>
hedge funds, and the like.  Wealth creation, to this line of thinking, is
<br>
manual labor and anything that makes money that doesn't involve direct
<br>
manual labor must, therefore, be taking from some manual laborers.
<br>
<p>The problem with this view is that it looks at economics (and property and
<br>
human life) in completely perceptual terms, treating manual labor as
<br>
separate from all else in a very undialectical even atomistic fashion.  The
<br>
manual laborer, by this view, creates the real stuff and anything above that
<br>
level -- managers, entrepreneurs, bankers, investors, financial forecasters,
<br>
arbitragers, R&amp;D people -- are not adding wealth.  This view totally
<br>
disregards the mind and its place in the economy.
<br>
<p>And I agree, entrepreneurial skills are rare...  and seemingly
<br>
unteachable -- else Harvard or Wharton would be churning them out.  A free
<br>
market, at least, gives room for such skills to flourish.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
