<em>&gt;From: Spike Jones &lt;<a href="mailto:spike66@attglobal.net?Subject=Re:%20MEDIA:%20Re:Last%20nights%20NOVA/FRONTLINE%20special&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104261417.HAA02662@well.com&gt;">spike66@attglobal.net</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Harvest of Fear, yes, that was an excellent and surprisingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well balanced treatment.  The star of the show was the Kenyan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientist, for she helped me realize that I did not even begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to understand the problem of starvation in Africa.
</em><br>
<p>I thought she was great too, I also liked the guy in Mexico who
<br>
worked with producing plants that could function in high aluminum
<br>
soils, the papaya on Hawaii were also good.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The anti-GMers argue that giving the rural Africans GM will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only make them dependent upon western technology.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what is the alternative?  If the west gives food to the underfed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Africans, it still has an enormous cost by the time it gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its intended recipients, for the transportation costs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enormous.  Rural Africa lacks the transportation infrastructure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such as trucks, which would be useless anyway for they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lack adequate roads.  Often supples must be hauled in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wheelbarrows by hand.  This in addition to the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rural African farmers have their pride, and are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beggars.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think these were good examples of biotech, along with the
<br>
&quot;Golden&quot; rice. I think things like &quot;Roundup&quot; anything are bad
<br>
because they continue the bad practice of argricultural runoff of
<br>
pesticide. I'm still out, but leaning negatively on BT corn and
<br>
other products.
<br>
<p>The most important part of the show I still feel dealt will the
<br>
issue of labeling. It was clear from the focus groups that if the
<br>
industry labels it has a future, but if it continues to resist it
<br>
faces a war.
