<p><em>&gt; &gt; Holistic approaches are being actively deprecated, since breaking

<p>So, we know about the 'magical' evolved FPGA with an apparently disconnected
<br>
part which seems to use weird induction effects to function really tightly.
<br>
Within a small temperature range.  Has anyone performed the next step, of
<br>
repeating the experiment while varying the physical environment?  If you make
<br>
the FPGA suffer normal working conditions, does the result look more normal?
<br>
<p>I also can't help thinking at if I was an evolved AI I might not thank my
<br>
creators.  &quot;Geez, guys, I was supposed to be an improvement on the human
<br>
condition.  You know, highly modular, easily understadable mechanisms, the
<br>
ability to plug in new senses, and merge memories from my forked copies.
<br>
Instead I'm as fucked up as you, only in silicon, and can't even make backups
<br>
because I'm tied to dumb quantum induction effects.  Bite my shiny metal ass!&quot;
