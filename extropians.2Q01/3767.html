<p>Open Source doesn't need a profile boost. It would have a negative impact
<br>
on software quality. It already grows too quickly for its own good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; again, I bet a lot of companies and paradigms said something along the

</em><br>
<p>Open Source is not a company. It is an international movement with a
<br>
considerable, and mounting momentum. Because it is autocatalytic in
<br>
regards to information delivery, software generation and distribution and
<br>
doesn't appear as a blip in legal, economical or physical space it is
<br>
largely immune to attacks conducted in that space.
<br>
<p>Obviously, Open Source is here to stay. Whether there will be companies
<br>
riding on that momentum (or other companies mounting memetic attacks
<br>
against companies who are riding that momentum in an attempt to enhance
<br>
their market position) has largely footnote character.
<br>
<p>Now the next thing to tackle would be Open Source hardware. It's already
<br>
there, but it needs lots of work still.
