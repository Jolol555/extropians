</em><br>
<p>Certainly not, and for two reasons.  In the first place, what Greg
<br>
Egan was talking about was not reversibility in the sense of
<br>
reversible computation.  He simply ran some scenes in a different
<br>
order.  If the successive states are denoted A--B--C--D--E, then
<br>
he was only talking about having a copy experience D--E, then C--D,
<br>
and so on.  This is nothing more than slicing up calculations that
<br>
are still &quot;forward&quot; going.  With reversible computers, of course,
<br>
we are talking about sequences such as E--D--C--B--A.
<br>
<p>The second reason is that Greg Egan does not appear to be talking
<br>
about the kinds of computation, in general, that can be accomplished
<br>
by a Turing machine (or a computer).  In a very confused way, he
<br>
appears to be talking about a restricted kind of computation.
<br>
<p>Anyway, let me digress to explain how Egan was probably going wrong.
<br>
I used to think that I knew exactly how it happened.  If you ask anyone
<br>
who is reading this what a good mathematical model of the conscious
<br>
development in real time of an organism should be, they'll sooner or
<br>
later point you in the direction of non-linear dynamics (chaos theory),
<br>
because of the way that our lives, as well as so many other physical
<br>
phenomena, exhibit features not found in differential equations.
<br>
<p>I mean to say that it wouldn't have occurred to Maxwell to attempt
<br>
to model millions of interactions large scale objects using
<br>
differential equations.  There is a clear non-compressibility
<br>
of the entire &quot;calculation&quot; of varies and mixed kinds of objects,
<br>
much as one sees in Conway's Life.
<br>
<p>Differential equations are a tool useful in non-chaotic calculations.
<br>
Yes, it's true that the initial conditions determine the final state
<br>
just as in, say, cellular autonoma.  Yes, it's true that differential
<br>
equations can display sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  
<br>
But unlike the kind of chaotic development that I'm talking about, in
<br>
which each state is necessary for the calculation of all following
<br>
states, differential equations often submit to formal symbolic
<br>
methods in such a manner that intermediate states (and calculations)
<br>
can be ignored.
<br>
<p>I think that Greg Egan refers to &quot;differential equations&quot; at least
<br>
once, though I can't find it.  But on pages 48-49, what he's talking
<br>
about is just not clear.  He says, first, &quot;His model of a brain was
<br>
being fully described at half-second (model time) intervals---but each
<br>
description still included the results of everything that &quot;would have
<br>
happened&quot; in between&quot;.   Now from this you would think that the
<br>
emulation of Paul Durham was not experiencing each of the little
<br>
steps during the half-seconds.
<br>
<p>But then on the next page he goes on, &quot;The equations controlling the
<br>
model were far too complex to solve in a single step.  In the process
<br>
of calculating the solutions, vast arrays of partial results were
<br>
being generated and discarded along the way.  In a sense, these
<br>
partial results **implied**---even if they didn't directly represent---
<br>
events taking place within the gaps between successive complete
<br>
descriptions.&quot;   And when the whole model was arbitrary, who was to
<br>
say that these implied events, buried a little more deeply in the
<br>
torrent of data, were any &quot;less real&quot; than those which were directly
<br>
described?&quot;
<br>
<p>It's obvious that he's leaning way too heavily on some very unclear
<br>
concepts such as &quot;implied&quot;, &quot;represent&quot; and &quot;fully described&quot;, or
<br>
at least trying to get some strange mileage out of them.
<br>
<p>For sure it was sensitive dependence on confused concepts that
<br>
led Greg Egan downward into the Theory of Dust.  And it's not
<br>
impossible that he knew this perfectly well, and was having some
<br>
fun, as he seemed to indicate in one interview.
