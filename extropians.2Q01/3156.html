</em><br>
<p>Jim, *I* wouldn't have slapped you down.  If you were on SL4, and you told
<br>
me you were considering leaving because the post quality was getting too
<br>
low, I would panic.  If you posted a message tomorrow saying that you were
<br>
leaving the Extropians list, I would have followed up with a message
<br>
saying:  &quot;Well, now we've lost Jim Fehlinger!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm a little dismayed by your control-freaky attitude, Eliezer -- if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing else, it's a waste of energy.  You already have a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corner of the Internet where you can be god-emperor -- your SL4 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarians' lists.  You sound like a print magazine editor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two or three times your age harrumphing about competition from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;irresponsible&quot; journalists on the Web (like the editors of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hi-fi magazines I read).
</em><br>
<p>Well, the Singularitarians list is low-volume... but the SL4 list - where
<br>
I am, as you put it, the god-emperor, or rather merely moderator - has a
<br>
hell of a lot higher post quality than the Extropian list.  It takes being
<br>
on a young, growing list to appreciate how this list is dying.  There are
<br>
plenty of opinions on SL4 opposed to mine.  They are simply, by and large,
<br>
correctly spelled.  There are no (or very few) one-liner &quot;me too&quot;
<br>
postings.  When an issue arises that has been previously discussed, the
<br>
poster is referred to the list archives; we may have only a fourth as many
<br>
messages as Extropians, but the messages are *all* new and unexplored
<br>
territory.  In short, it's a lot like the Extropians list circa 1996,
<br>
although higher-quality and lower-volume.
<br>
<p>But the Extropians list is much higher-profile.  As such, it performs a
<br>
function within the transhumanist community, one from which I have
<br>
benefited in the past, and it concerns me if that functionality seems to
<br>
be being lost.  And since the Extropians list is higher-profile, it
<br>
sincerely concerns me that more real-world things seem to be happening on
<br>
SL4 than on Extropians.  Imagine how much a high-profile list like this
<br>
one could accomplish!  If it weren't driving away all the new subscribers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And again the broadly-directed elitist swipe -- this business about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cherished subscribers ... with major identities outside [the list]&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the hell does that mean?  They have Nobels, Pulitzers?  They've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been on the cover of _Time_?  They've been interviewed by Barbara
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Walters?  Damien Broderick has a substantial presence in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memesphere outside this list, but he's never used it as an excuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to intimidate or bully anybody, and he's willing to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on the basis of the content of their posts **to this list**,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without sniffing around to see Who's Who.  You know, the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somebodies of the world probably don't have a lot of time to spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Internet, and the ones that do either have to do it anonymously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (can you imagine Bill Gates posting to this list under his own name?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or by means of forums with the requisite amount of privacy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusivity (like your own Singularitarians' list, n'est-ce pas?).
</em><br>
<p>One of the most valuable functions of a living, breathing mailing list is
<br>
the ability for real-world things to happen as a result of what goes on
<br>
there - for there to be real-world consequences, not just endless
<br>
complaining and &quot;someone ought to&quot; and project proposals that never go
<br>
anywhere.  And for that to happen, it is necessary that the list
<br>
environment be liveable for a person who is extremely busy, because at
<br>
least one person who is extremely busy is usually a necessary component
<br>
for any real-world operation.
<br>
<p>A list needs them both - the Who's Whos and the brilliant
<br>
seventeen-year-olds and everyone on the spectrum in between.  My point is
<br>
that a huge volume of babbling isn't just tragic because it drives away
<br>
that set of smart people who have limited time, but because the smart
<br>
people who have limited time are necessary to one of the most important
<br>
functionalities of the list.  Losing *any* smart person for whatever
<br>
reason is a tragedy, but it's an individual tragedy, a tragedy a list can
<br>
survive.
