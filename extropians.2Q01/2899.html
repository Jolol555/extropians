While obstetrics might be one factor that helps, I think one should not
<br>
discount the better nutrition and more stimulating environment that has
<br>
developed. If it was just an issue of birth skull size we would see
<br>
national differences much more clearly than is currently observed in the
<br>
Flynn effect due to differences in health care. Evolutionary pressures
<br>
are too slow to act much over the ~4 generations ibstetrics has become
<br>
good.
<br>
<p>If Friedmans idea is right, then we would see an increase in bright
<br>
people that would otherwise not have been born (or made stupid by brain
<br>
trauma), so his model predicts increased variance and a very slight
<br>
increase in mean, not that the mean and median are climbing.

<p>The brain is metabolically very expensive, if you have trouble feeding
<br>
yourself a larger brain might not be an advantage at all.
<br>
<p>Apropos smaller families, this could also be a factor: I remember seeing
<br>
in one of my psychology textborns that firstborns often exhibit higher
<br>
IQs than their siblings. The reason for this is unclear, possibly
<br>
because they are surrounded by a higher mean IQ.
