Sue them!  Here, the pronoun is subjective.  That means, there are laws about
<br>
who gets to look at who, and we all would get to see, for having functional
<br>
eyes.

<em>&gt; &gt; Let's assume as a given that within a short number of years, say maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 20, that the capability of a single individual to cause widespread havoc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will will be tremendously increased from what's possible today. Henious

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we'll have to monitor every molecule. Failure to do so could result in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the extinction of the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given this assumption, what is the effectiveness of covert as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overt monitoring? Which is more prone to abuse?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see extropian/libertarian choices as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1) Continue opposition to the whole 'Transparent Society' concept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forcing monitoring to be covert. Abuses and unaccountability are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implicitly encouraged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2) Embrace overt monitoring, and (to borrow a theme from Microsoft)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extend it, by demanding LE resources be taken away from victimless vice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crimes and applied directly to anti-terrorism efforts. This might also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; include national policy changes to avoid pissing off half the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My belief is that the 2nd approach would result in maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accountability and more actual liberty. However I welcome other choices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or arguments as to why my premises are incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have much intersection with this particular sphere, but to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, the primary issue has always been whether &quot;monitoring&quot; will be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool of government or the open province of individuals.  A society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which every individual has the capability to monitor every other would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very interesting, and probably superior (in both safety and society) to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government-controlled monitoring system.  Better yet would be no monitors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.  Even *better* might be a system in which all elected officials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are subject to 24-hour total monitoring while all the citizens live out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their opaque lives.  I have little emotional stake in these opinions, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I nonetheless wish to point out that the above dualism may parse up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem along the wrong axis.  Not covert versus overt; public versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private.

<p>I think you have it a little wrong, the public servants are only available for
<br>
public monitoring while at work, and not when it would unduly disturb them,
<br>
but all the time, that is, it would not not be taped.  That is also to say,
<br>
someone could arguably claim that when they went to the bathroom while being a
<br>
police officer or fireman that that &quot;video&quot; was relatively private, and not
<br>
&quot;generally available&quot;.  Yet, if any question arose about the actions of the
<br>
police officer or officers while they were in the bathroom where the answer
<br>
affected the public interest, then that would actually be on file.
<br>
<p>Private citizens, for example, police officers at home, could expect relative
<br>
privacy.  For example, if the officer had an illicit home manufactury and it
<br>
was next to an open window in a side yard not generally accessible to the
<br>
public, then it could not be used by itself for being there in the sense of it
<br>
being contrary to the law.  Alternatively, if someone saw the police officer
<br>
performing a violent crime through the window on their otherwise private
<br>
property, then that could actually be used by the citizen who could see
<br>
through the relatively private property to notify the authorities of the
<br>
suspicion of a violent act in progress.  So, there would be less anonymous
<br>
tips.
