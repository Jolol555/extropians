<p>Coooool!  This is EXACTLY what I had in mind, and Adrian you
<br>
need not wait until you have a complete work.  If you have an
<br>
HTML sketch with equations, thats a goooood start.  Sometime we
<br>
need to define and limit the scope of the project.  I propose Adrian's
<br>
plasma engine model as the seed.  Over the next few weeks, we
<br>
could review his site, derive equations that predict the performance,
<br>
collect materials from the web that pertain to plasma engines,
<br>
etc.  The competition isnt closed, but a plasma engine sounds
<br>
like a good place to start the model, eh?
<br>
<p>By coincidence, Robert Bradbury and I have been offlisting
<br>
regarding a fission thruster that has been proposed, so that
<br>
topic is very timely.  Robert has a number of sources on
<br>
his websites that will likely be quite useful for reference.
<br>
<p>So what we do now is look over Adrian's equations, suggest
<br>
improvements etc.  For the first round, shall we assume
<br>
ourselves already in LEO?  Then later we can look at the
<br>
various launchers that are available.   spike
