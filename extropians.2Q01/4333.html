Any expert French speakers here?
<br>
<p>In my dream, I (or the viewpoint character) was in a busy room with (I
<br>
suppose) a hard bitten French woman journalist sitting behind a monitor.
<br>
She said something brusque about some news that was in LUH-cong, the `ng'
<br>
being that glottal stop thing that the French do in names like Lacan. I
<br>
didn't know what she meant (it didn't occur to me that she meant `Lacan',
<br>
elaborate game-playing psychoanalyst of dreams), and she showed me the
<br>
screen or maybe the paper: L'Econ. Shorthand for the French translation of
<br>
The Economist newspaper (I don't know if such a thing actually exists). I
<br>
was surprised, because I'd never heard anyone say it in French, and in my
<br>
monoglot ignorance would have expected it to be something like
<br>
`Leck-onee-MEEST'. When I woke up I was struck by the multi-levelled
<br>
quality of this sequence, the depths of hidden or implied processing
<br>
involved. *Would* a French speaker utter L'Econ like that?
