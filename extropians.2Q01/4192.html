<em>&gt;&gt; If you ask anyone who is reading this what a good mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; model of the conscious development in real time of an organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be, they'll sooner or later point you in the direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of non-linear dynamics (chaos theory), because of the way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; our lives, as well as so many other physical phenomena, exhibit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; features not found in differential equations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This makes no sense to me. Differential equations are one of the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical handles for linear and nonlinear physics, as well as for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every other physical approximation that I'm familiar with.  Even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your differential equations computes into a coupled system of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million-by-million eigenvalue matrix, the mathematical formulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your differential equations is still valid.
</em><br>
<p>We have since the days of the Bernoullis been formulating differential
<br>
equations to describe a lot of physical phenomena.  Whether it's heat
<br>
flow in solids (Fourier's big breakthrough) or cables hanging in
<br>
catenaries, using the language of mathematics to express infinitesimal
<br>
constraints has been extremely productive.  But it is only in this
<br>
arena, important as it is, that differential equations are of any use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are you maybe mixing &quot;continuous&quot; and &quot;discrete&quot; ??
</em><br>
<p>No.  Discrete mathematics is less amenable to this sort of &quot;global&quot;
<br>
technique.  Sure, there are difference equations in finite mathematics
<br>
that resemble differential equations, and we surely use algebra to
<br>
specify constraints.  But no one has ever seriously proposed, for
<br>
example, that solutions to chess problems might be facilitated by
<br>
equations.  Nor do quantitative equations illuminate axiomatic
<br>
developments.  And I hope that no one has tried to frame
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; in terms of differential equations.
<br>
<p>In my original post of Thursday May 10, from which the above
<br>
quote was taken, I tried to explain more fully why computation,
<br>
which, since the days of Turing we've come more and more to see
<br>
as fundamentally discrete, can't be straitjacketed by differential
<br>
equations.  Its very nature, wonderfully and visually epitomized
<br>
by Conway's Life and other cellular autonoma, seems significantly
<br>
different.  The closest that I myself have come to capturing the
<br>
essential difference is what I mentioned yesterday in this thread,
<br>
namely that from a computational perspective, the myriads of intermediate
<br>
results necessary in the numerical solution of differential equations
<br>
are merely approximations to the mathematical truth.  But in iterative
<br>
calculations of this other kind, e.g., Life, chess, Turing machines,
<br>
and the disjointed details of our lives on Earth, the necessary
<br>
intermediate results **are** the &quot;mathematical&quot; truths themselves.
