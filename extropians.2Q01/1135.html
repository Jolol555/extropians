<p>I suspect NASA's motivation is not getting astronauts - that
<br>
would be easy even with high mortality, as you observe.  Rather,
<br>
I think they're concerned with PR.  Killing a hero is very, very
<br>
bad PR, especially for those who hear little of NASA.  If
<br>
somebody died as a result of the kinds of goofs that have
<br>
done in several recent Mars missions, it could be the end
<br>
of public funding of manned space missions.
