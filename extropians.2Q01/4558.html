<p>John, you should put a smiley on that.  The government hasn't
<br>
outlawed &quot;biological enhancements&quot;.  Its only &quot;considering&quot;
<br>
outlawing a narrow definition of &quot;cloning&quot; which affects
<br>
the reproduction rights of infertile couples much more than
<br>
it impacts anything most extropians or transhumanists would
<br>
like to do.
<br>
<p>Now, re:
<br>
<em>&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Bush administration review is recommending the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States not support a draft agreement to enforce an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international treaty banning biological weapons, Sunday's New York 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Times reports, quoting an unidentified senior official. 
</em><br>
<p>We should watch to see if anything concrete turns up about *why*
<br>
the recommendation came out that way.  I can see why one
<br>
wouldn't want to sign a treaty that gave an illusion of
<br>
safety that really wasn't there.  The &quot;negotiators&quot; in
<br>
Geneva could all pack up and go home and you would never
<br>
get any real increase in security at all.
<br>
<p>This may be the tip of the iceberg on why you cannot (effectively)
<br>
legislate against nanotech (enforcement is futile).  Though if
<br>
you had quasi-ubiquitous surveillance based on MEMS-based robotic
<br>
cameras and a *lot* of sophisticated computers analyzing what
<br>
they see, you might be able to police biotech/nanotech labs.
<br>
It would be a pretty unpleasant environment for someone such
<br>
as myself to work in but there are probably people who could
<br>
adapt to it.
