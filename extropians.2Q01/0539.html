Nick's paper contained:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can speculate that advanced civilization all develop along a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course that leads to the recognition of an ethical prohibition on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running ancestor-simulation because of the suffering that causes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inhabitants of the simulation. However, from our present point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of view, it is not clear that creating a human race is immoral - on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the contrary, we tend to view the existence of our race as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constituting a great ethical value. Moreover, convergence on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical view of the immorality of running ancestor-simulations is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not enough: it must be combined with a convergence on a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure that allows activities considered immoral to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively banned
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a qualia theory is true, &quot;zombie&quot; or pure abstract
<br>
simulations would be possible.  In a &quot;zombie&quot; simulation everything is
<br>
represented by some cause and effect mechanics, there would just be no
<br>
actual phenomenal consciousness and hence no suffering or joy.  Just
<br>
as there is no joy of the experience of color in the representation of
<br>
color inside a paint detecting machine.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, you could gain any desired value, without the
<br>
suffering.  There would be no reason for anyone to create such a
<br>
system full of such actual mysery death and suffering, and hence no
<br>
need to have any kind of law to force people not to do so in any kind
<br>
of full of progress future.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, it's the same argument for why there is no Gods, or why
<br>
there are not powerful ET's hiding from us, yet watching us.  Or at
<br>
least an argument as to why we should hope for such.  It's to easy to
<br>
imagine ways to gain whatever it is we might provide to them without
<br>
all the mysery, death, and suffering.  If you insist there is God,
<br>
powerful ET, or that we are in some future simulation, then you are
<br>
always left with attempting to justify why they would even want all
<br>
this kind of mysery and suffering with various absurd &quot;theodicies&quot; as
<br>
to why an all powerful God, yet still so much mysery.  It's infinitely
<br>
easer to imagine ways to get whatever it is they might want without
<br>
the suffering, than to try to justify their existence and them causing
<br>
or bringing to pass all the evil we know.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not know for absolute certainty that there are no Gods,
<br>
no powerful ET's hiding from us, or that we are not being run in some
<br>
posthuman's simulation, whether it's their history or not.  I just
<br>
hope that such is not the case.  How terrible to think we must
<br>
eternally create such mysery and suffering for so many, simply in
<br>
order to relive a moment in history, a variation of such, or whatever.
<br>
I hope we will be able to find some way to perfectly remember it or
<br>
whatever without actually really reproducing all the hell and
<br>
suffering involved.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I want to do is eternally remove all real mysery,
<br>
suffering, isolation, death... and and make all such mysery and evil
<br>
no longer necessary.  Perhaps this isn't possible in a universe with
<br>
our physical laws you might imagine?  If so, then just create a
<br>
simulation in in which it is possible to exist without evils like
<br>
death and true suffering.  If such evil and suffering really is
<br>
necessary for such advanced beings, then we must give up all hope of
<br>
ever achieving anything better.  We must then abandon all hope.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no compelling reason to do this.  Hence, I remain an
<br>
ahteist and continue to hope there is not yet Gods and that all evil
<br>
like death and suffering will be eliminated long before anything close
<br>
to this ever exists.
