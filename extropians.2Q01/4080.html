<p>Mead's influence within anthropology was immense.  It was Mead
<br>
who gave almost limitless credibility to Franz Boas' whole 
<br>
program of repudiating every 19th century belief about society
<br>
and anthropology that he could.  For all the evils of 19th
<br>
century views, Boas and Mead went way too in the other direction,
<br>
especially in causing entire abandonment of the very idea that
<br>
there is a &quot;human nature&quot;.  Only in the last two decades of the
<br>
20th century were these baleful influences finally countered
<br>
successfully.
<br>
<p>But the wreckage within anthropology caused by Boas and Mead
<br>
pails in comparison to the untoward influence they exerted on
<br>
greater western civilization.  Almost every kind of socialism,
<br>
and every government program designed (with the best of intentions,
<br>
of course) to improve the lives of people, got support from what
<br>
was being proclaimed within the social sciences at the time,
<br>
which in turn rested to a great degree on the supposed
<br>
&quot;scientific&quot; results obtained by Margaret Mead.
<br>
<p>Would you please give some examples from &quot;the vast body of 
<br>
anthropological work... not influenced by her&quot;?   (Thanks!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No one in the field has ever held her up as some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;icon or queen bee (or even as anthropology's Einstein)...
</em><br>
<p>That was not my impression, and little else can explain the
<br>
vehemence in many quarters against Derek Freeman.
