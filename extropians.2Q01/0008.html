<p>Patient power
<br>
<p>People with inherited diseases are preparing a
<br>
global challenge to pro-lifers over the future of
<br>
medical research 
<br>
<p>Exclusive from New Scientist magazine 
<br>
<p>Patient power is getting a global voice through a new
<br>
movement to represent people with a range of hereditary
<br>
diseases. The grouping will support, and may ultimately control
<br>
medical research into these illnesses. Its backers also aim to
<br>
challenge anti-abortion, animal rights and other lobby groups
<br>
that oppose some forms of biomedical research.
<br>
<p>The movement will have teeth to back its arguments. One
<br>
group of supporters has applied for patents on a gene which
<br>
causes the distressing disease pseudoxanthoma elasticum. 
<br>
<p>&quot;With the heavy stick of holding a patent on the gene, we can
<br>
accelerate the research process, control royalty and licence
<br>
fees, and eliminate turf wars between researchers,&quot; says
<br>
Patrick Terry, chairman of the advocacy group PXE
<br>
International, based in Sharon, Massachusetts. 
<br>
<p>Empowering patients 
<br>
<p>People with PXE accumulate calcium in their tissue, which
<br>
gradually sags, cracks and loses its elasticity. Many sufferers
<br>
go blind by the age of 30 or 40 because of damage to the
<br>
retina.
<br>
<p>Terry, who has two children with the condition, worked with
<br>
other sufferers to finance a patent application on ABCC6, the
<br>
gene which causes PXE when faulty. It was identified last year
<br>
by Charles Boyd of the University of Hawaii and other
<br>
researchers backed by PXE International. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We're not interested in lining our pockets. We just want a
<br>
cure,&quot; says Terry. He sees holding the patent as a way of
<br>
empowering patients, the people who have most to gain from
<br>
research into the condition. In the long term, PXE International
<br>
may also be able to influence, and to some degree control, the
<br>
direction of research into the disease.
<br>
<p>Political influence 
<br>
<p>The idea of patients applying for patents is just one new
<br>
strategy for what could become one of world's most powerful
<br>
political lobbies. Earlier this month, at the BioVision meeting on
<br>
biotechnology in Lyon, France, Terry combined with delegates
<br>
from other groups representing patients with rare hereditary
<br>
conditions to form a global alliance. 
<br>
<p>Founders include the UK-based Genetic Interest Group (GIG),
<br>
the Genetic Alliance in the US, plus patient groups from the
<br>
Netherlands, Belgium and Iran. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We want a spot at the negotiating table,&quot; says Terry. &quot;The
<br>
voice of the patient has not been heard. It's a matter of
<br>
empowering communities to speak clearly and more vocally,&quot;
<br>
he says. Terry says the idea will be taken forward at a
<br>
meeting in Vienna in May of the European Alliance of Patient
<br>
and Parent Organisations for Genetic Services and Innovation
<br>
in Medicine (EAGS). 
<br>
<p>Moral high ground 
<br>
<p>Terry doesn't rule out the idea of expanding the alliance to
<br>
include charities focusing on more widespread illnesses such as
<br>
cancer. &quot;We need to give attention to multifactorial diseases,&quot;
<br>
he says.
<br>
<p>&quot;We hope to provide a new voice internationally to support the
<br>
application of good science to alleviating problems of ill
<br>
health,&quot; says Alastair Kent, director of GIG and president of
<br>
the EAGS. 
<br>
<p>The new alliance will attempt to win the moral high ground
<br>
from anti-abortion and antivivisection groups, he says. It
<br>
could, for example, challenge the absolute opposition by
<br>
anti-abortionists to research on human eggs or early embryos. 
<br>
<p>To opponents of embryo research who say it's wrong to
<br>
destroy a potential human being, Kent says: &quot;It's a very
<br>
theoretical future person they're talking about, as opposed to
<br>
a very real, living person who's having to cope with a serious
<br>
disease.&quot;
<br>
<p>Animal testing 
<br>
<p>Similar arguments might be deployed against opponents of
<br>
animal testing. Without research on animals, &quot;you're putting
<br>
the protection of the animal ahead of the cure for a human
<br>
being&quot;, Kent says. Patients are &quot;real people living real lives&quot;,
<br>
says Terry.
<br>
<p>The new alliance will be looking for consensus among its
<br>
members when developing its global policies. That may be
<br>
difficult to achieve in some cases, says Greg Vines, a
<br>
spokesman for Britain's Parkinson's Disease Society. He says it
<br>
could be difficult to reach a unified position on embryo
<br>
research, for example, if patient advocacy groups are divided
<br>
along religious lines.
<br>
<p>This hasn't stopped the Parkinson's society backing the new
<br>
alliance. &quot;Policy makers want to meet people with disease,&quot;
<br>
Vines says. The society lobbied for patients last year when
<br>
Britain was considering changing the law on stem cell research
<br>
and therapeutic cloning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfied that we know enough to get by. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every question we answer leads on to another
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest
