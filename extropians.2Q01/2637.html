<p><em>&gt;The common element here is that you have lent or rented out some

</em><br>
<em>&gt;something for money?
</em><br>
<p>Not quite the *definition*, but one example of what they consider
<br>
exploitation, yes. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A loan is a transfer of property accompanied by a promise to give it back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A loan for money adds a transfer of money from borrower to lender.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Apparently this is evil.  Why?
</em><br>
<p>According to a strong version of the labor theory of value,
<br>
&quot;commodities...in which equal quantities of labor are embodied, or which
<br>
can be produced in the same time, have the same value.  The value of one
<br>
commodity is to the value of any other, as the labour-time necessary for
<br>
the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the
<br>
other.&quot; (Marx, _Capital_, 1.1.1)  From this absurd refinement of a rare
<br>
error in Adam Smith, it would follow that what bankers or investors do with
<br>
commodities could not possibly add anything to their value; therefore, the
<br>
extent to which these individuals profit is the extent to which they are
<br>
leeching off the alleged &quot;real producers&quot; of the full value of the product,
<br>
the wage laborers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What about other contractual arrangements?  Suppose I give you some object
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in exchange for your promise to give me money on a regular, ongoing basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is not a loan because there is no promise to return the object.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Does this make it morally OK?  Why or why not?
</em><br>
<p>According to their way of thinking, unless you actually changed the product
<br>
through your labor, you didn't add any value.  So, if you just buy books
<br>
from garage sales, give them to me for a monthly fee, and realize a profit,
<br>
then you must be engaged in exploitation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm having trouble understanding the dividing line between which kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of freely-chosen, voluntarily-agreed-to arrangements between private
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals are acceptable in this system and which are not.
</em><br>
<p>So am I.  They usually end up attacking your definition of &quot;freedom&quot;.
