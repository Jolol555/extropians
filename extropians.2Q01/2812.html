<em>&gt; You better get working on coming up with some sane model of a &quot;leftist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism&quot; (for lack of a better word). I have been asking for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for ages - I think there is nothing that has hurt the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism as much as the lack of internal debate over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical foundations of transhumanism. We need something more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just taking one's normal political stance with transhumanism tacked onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, we need a true synthesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
As a philosopher myself it is pleasant to think that this is true. But I
<br>
wonder why. Do you mean by a &quot;synthesis&quot; that we ought to be looking for a
<br>
unifying political philosophy for transhumanism? Why isn't a healthy
<br>
pragmatism here sufficient? For example, why can't liberal, socialist,
<br>
libertarian, and facist transhumanists be content to work together on
<br>
specific issues? Or by synthesis do you mean that we ought to have a menu of
<br>
traditional political philosophies synthesized with transhumanism? E.g., if
<br>
you are socialist please press 3, if you are a facist please press 4, etc.
<br>
My own view is that the question of whether a transhumanist ethics can be
<br>
fashioned is the logically prior question. For all political philosophies
<br>
announce or presuppose some theory of human nature. But transhumanism raises
<br>
the question of which nature ought we to have; which is in itself an ethical
<br>
question. Suppose, for example, your political philosophy is based on a
<br>
theory of human nature which says people are basically selfish: &quot;man seeketh
<br>
power after power ending only in death&quot;. Transhumanism asks whether we ought
<br>
to be selfish by nature. Socialism is sometimes derided for being based on
<br>
an overly optimistic view of human nature. If this is so then it looks like
<br>
it is merely a technical problem to implimenting socialism, viz., we have to
<br>
tweek human nature. Conversely, perhaps we could make libertarianism more
<br>
successful if we made everyone value liberty above all else, etc. My own
<br>
ethical research at present is whether the virtue based perfectionist
<br>
tradition in ethics (Plato to Nietzsche) might--if radically reworked-- be
<br>
the appropriate for transhumanism. Whether this ethical research will have
<br>
dividends for political philosophy I can't say at this point. I am not that
<br>
optimistic for the possibility of a synthesis given that transhumanism is
<br>
working in a completely new ecological space in the intellectual
<br>
environment. (Unless by 'synthesis' we mean aufheben). Part of the problem
<br>
is that traditional ethics suffers from a similar limitation as political
<br>
philosophy, namely, that all ethical theories presuppose a theory of human
<br>
nature. (It is true that some ancient and modern conceptions allow for
<br>
differences of degree in human nature, but not the difference in kind
<br>
suggested by the notion of posthumans). As a simple example of this consider
<br>
the claim by Kant that &quot;ought implies can&quot;. It is absurd to say that  I
<br>
ought to allievate all suffering on this earth because I can't. (I can lend
<br>
a hand, but I can't do it all by myself). What we can and can't do is
<br>
circumscribed in part by who we are, i.e., in part by our nature. By
<br>
changing the scope of what we can do, by altering our natures, will likely
<br>
lead to an increase in the scope of what we ought to do.
