<p>&lt;&lt; Yes, Instant travel by means of teleport or wormhole is a fantastic idea 
<br>
&nbsp;that has been knocking around for years, but it will need some very carefull 
<br>
&nbsp;thought before we explosively decompress the whole planet.

Alex, have you ever seen some of the older series by Larry Niven, such as the 
<br>
&quot;Floating Riot Club&quot; and such? That is pretty much the apotheosis of 
<br>
&quot;teleport&quot; fiction that I know of that is consistent. The work is somewhat 
<br>
dated being written in the late 1960 and early 1970's, but is still durable. 
<br>
They are all short stories.
<br>
