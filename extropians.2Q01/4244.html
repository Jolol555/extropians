</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some species are more robust and more capable of

</em><br>
<p>I agree, but this assumes that only those survived the impact.  Are you sure
<br>
this fits the data?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have plenty of examples of species living today that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are on the ragged edge, such as the taxifornia condor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It survives today only because of extraordinary efforts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the part of the environmentalists to keep them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soaring.  Apparently this movement does not accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinctions as a natural part of evolution, and so attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prevent all extinctions.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the flip side, we have plenty of examples of super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robust, super-adaptable species, such as rats, mosquitos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and humans.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Did only &quot;super-adaptable&quot; organisms survive?  What is the evidence?
<br>
<p>Archibald does not completely disagree here, though he does look over which
<br>
species survived, when the extinctions seem to take place, and alternatives
<br>
to explain its disappearance.  On the first, it's important to know to
<br>
narrow down the causes.  Marine regression would kill certain organisms and
<br>
benefit others.  Specifically, freshwater species would do better under
<br>
marine regression, while large land vertebrates and marine species would
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>On the second, timing is important; if the last example of a certain species
<br>
occurs five million years before the impact, cannot be sure that an impact
<br>
did them in.  There seems to be plenty of evidence of a decline in nonavian
<br>
dinosaurs before the Creataceous-Tertiary Boundary.
<br>
<p>On the third, it's just good science to have alternative explanations.  May
<br>
the best one win.  Again, Archibald does think a bolide impact played a
<br>
role.  He also thinks the evidence is strong for marine regression.  Imagine
<br>
this: small impact combined with an ongoing process of marine regression.
<br>
If this was the case, it would have a huge impact -- no pun intended -- on
<br>
the biosphere.  The ongoing marine regression would've upset many local
<br>
biomes, putting them on edge.  An impact might have pushed them over the
<br>
edge.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
