Daniel,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm also a lot more afraid of someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threatening someone and attempting to carry it out.
</em><br>
<p>To be on the quasi-safe side anyway, I suggest removing home address/phone
<br>
from Web pages, if you haven't, already.
<br>
<p>I realized how vulnerable I was, a couple years ago when a German
<br>
forrester wanted my help with a wavelets project, he went to my
<br>
Web pages and retrieved my home address and showed up on my doorstep. I
<br>
was away in the U.S. at the time. I came back two weeks later to a letter
<br>
in my mailbox, which my landlords said he wrote with their help (he told
<br>
them he was a friend of mine). Annoying. I don't think he was a threat,
<br>
but I lived at that time in a house that wasn't marked with numbers and
<br>
in a very remote and tiny village, 10km from Heidelberg, so I know that
<br>
he went to a lot of trouble to locate me.  Since that time, I don't
<br>
have home numbers at my Web pages.
<br>
<p>Ever since I moved here, I've wanted to have a non-Institute
<br>
contact address, for consulting work,  but services like
<br>
&quot;Mailboxes Etc.&quot; don't exist in this country (Germany). If any Germans
<br>
here have a suggestion for mailboxes to rent, I'd be interested to
<br>
know about it.
<br>
<p><p>Amara
