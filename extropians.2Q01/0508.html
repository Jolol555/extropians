<p><p>I don't see how this makes a difference; do you define consciousness as

an intelligent machine, I don't think it really matters whether or not it

knows what salt tastes like.  It is equally useful as an AI whether it

fails your definition of consciousness or not; I certainly don't think 
<br>
there is any real evidence that qualia is required for intelligence.  I 
<br>
don't care if an AI experiences red like I do (and we can't really know how 
<br>
it experiences it at all), but if it can identify red (trivial) then it has 
<br>
every bit as much utility as a human with regards to &quot;redness&quot;.

<p><p><em>&gt;         Red will always be fundamentally and primally red, and nothing

<p><p>So?  I don't grasp the importance.  Interesting perhaps, but I can't see it 
<br>
as anything more than a secondary effect.  It seems to me that you are 
<br>
putting undue weight on a relatively inconsequential phenomenon.  I know 
<br>
this has been gone over many times on the list, but this type of emphasis 
<br>
on qualia always comes across as a rather arbitrary fixation.  Maybe I'm 
<br>
just uneducable, but no one has ever said anything that has made me put any 
<br>
real value on it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Let's not miss this opportunity to

</em><br>
<p><p>I fully expect the basis for qualia to be not very interesting in the end; 
<br>
a one horse town off the beaten track to artificial intelligence.  I don't 
<br>
want to say &quot;Who cares?&quot; because some people obviously do, but even if what 
<br>
you say is largely true, what is the supposed benefit that plain old FS 
<br>
machine intelligence won't get us?
