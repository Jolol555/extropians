<em>&gt; The word &quot;vain&quot; is the Hebrew word &quot;shav&quot;.

<em>&gt; The Vatican says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and Lord,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in accord with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is truthful and legitimate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an oath highlights the relationship of human speech with God's truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second commandment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not swear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' But I say to you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do not swear at all. . . . Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than this comes from the evil one.&quot;Jesus teaches that every oath
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involves a reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock.

</em><br>
<p>Maybe it meant that it is a defined sin to represent oneself as God.  That is in the
<br>
context where &quot;taking the name of &quot; is &quot;assuming the guise of&quot;, and in the context of
<br>
an alternate to the more commonly understood meaning.  Is it possible that that
<br>
translation is accurate?  More regularly, it means to avoid cursing and swearing
<br>
false oaths, and to practice honesty, somewhat as explicated in your reference.  Why
<br>
do you ask?
<br>
<p>Considering as an example the Piss Christ, I think Jesus the Christ would think that
<br>
it was art, perhaps better art than some percentage of the iconography, where Jesus
<br>
the man is not available for comment.  For example, the loving Jesus would be humble
<br>
and would exhibit love for those whose urine his icon floated within, and offer them
<br>
salvation.  Then again, that cropo-Madonna is a knockoff of the Piss Christ.
