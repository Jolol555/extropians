<p>It doesn't matter what came first.  Nature will vary the

strategy to match the hazard function.  You could be a

k-strategist, but if your environment suddenly becomes
<br>
hazardous, only the r-leaning strategists within the
<br>
species are going to survive.
<br>
<p>It is very hard to develop k-strategy genomes -- you have
<br>
to get to the top of your environmental niche and then develop
<br>
strategies for reducing the risks associated with any
<br>
remaining &quot;natural&quot; hazards.  You also have to be smart
<br>
enough not to overpopulate the environment, causing it to
<br>
crash on you.  We seem to be playing brinkmanship in that
<br>
regard.
