<p>I figured as much.  There is in so many people an admirable
<br>
(and enormous) sympathy for the underdog.  But I tell myself
<br>
that I'd be most pleased if the guy who's the next Einstein
<br>
was a Jewish kid from New York, or a Chinese.  (There are so
<br>
many of them, and they're very bright.)  And I did mean &quot;guy&quot;,
<br>
because I've tried to incorporate an explanation of men's
<br>
and women's differences into my understanding.  I'm usually
<br>
(selfishly) hoping that my world-view is already accurate,
<br>
and that I understand the reasons for things, simply because
<br>
it takes so much work to revise it.  What if all the great
<br>
physicists of the next 30 years were Australian Aborigines,
<br>
or Hopi Amerinds, or good ol' boys from down south?  As
<br>
interesting as it would be, my world view would be severely
<br>
shaken.  (If people like me---who think that they've got
<br>
everything figured out---being shaken up a little adds to 
<br>
your enjoyment, that's not a bad thing.  At least someone
<br>
derives benefit.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for Lee's question about `Empire writers' (Clarke, Egan, me, etc): I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think in part this is a heightened awareness of the miseries our culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has inflicted on the peoples it ran roughshod over; oddly enough, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recognition has been made easier by the fact that by and large none of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever lived surrounded by a tenth of the population literally regarded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worth less than dogs.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not following this.  Okay, so you were raised in white suburbs 
<br>
in Australia and didn't see much of the &quot;darker&quot; peoples?  So the
<br>
idea is that if you had been raised surrounded by them that you 
<br>
would have learned the same racism that those who were usually had?
<br>
So that there was a heightening of awareness, and it obtained from
<br>
being a little removed from the forest (so that the trees didn't
<br>
block the view)?
<br>
<p>Still sounds strange.  The only thing that I can relate this to is
<br>
the way that environmentalists and nature worshippers aren't the
<br>
people who've actually grown up in natural surroundings.  The 
<br>
bonafide rural population tends to take nature for granted, and
<br>
be rather uninterested in eco-thought.
