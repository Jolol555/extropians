Genetically altered babies born
<br>
<p><p><p><p>By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse
<br>
Scientists have confirmed that the first genetically altered humans have 
<br>
been born and are healthy.
<br>
<p>Up to 30 such children have been born, 15 of them as a result of one 
<br>
experimental programme at a US laboratory.
<br>
<p><p><p>An &quot;unwelcome&quot; development say scientists
<br>
<p>But the technique has been criticised as unethical by some scientists and 
<br>
would be illegal in many countries, including the United Kingdom.
<br>
<p>Genetic fingerprint tests on two one-year-old children confirm that they 
<br>
contain a small quantity of additional genes not inherited from either 
<br>
parent.
<br>
<p>The additional genes were taken from a healthy donor and used to overcome 
<br>
their mother's infertility problems.
<br>
<p>Germline modification
<br>
<p>The additional genes that the children carry have altered their 'germline', 
<br>
or their collection of genes that they will pass on to their offspring.
<br>
<p>Altering the germline is something that the vast majority of scientists deem 
<br>
unethical given the limitations of our knowledge.
<br>
<p>It is illegal to do so in many countries and the US Government will not 
<br>
provide funds for any experiment that intentionally or unintentionally 
<br>
alters inherited genes.
<br>
<p><p><p>There is no evidence that this technique is worth doing
<br>
<p>Lord Winston
<br>
The children were born following a technique called ooplasmic transfer. This 
<br>
involves taking some of the contents of the donor cell and injecting it into 
<br>
the egg cell of a woman with infertility problems.
<br>
<p>The researchers, at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science of 
<br>
St Barnabas in New Jersey, US, believed that some women were infertile 
<br>
because of defects in their mitochondria.
<br>
<p>These are tiny structures containing genes that float around inside the cell 
<br>
away from the cell's nucleus, where the vast majority of the genes reside. 
<br>
There can be as many as 100,000 of them floating in the cells cytoplasm.
<br>
<p>Two mothers
<br>
<p>They are essential to cellular energy production and scientists suspect they 
<br>
have many other important but as yet unappreciated roles.
<br>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA is passed down from generation to generation along the 
<br>
maternal line.
<br>
<p>The US researchers wanted to supplement a woman's defective mitochondria 
<br>
with healthy ones from a donor.
<br>
<p>Having just tested the children born as a result of this procedure, the 
<br>
scientists have confirmed that the children's cells contain mitochondria, 
<br>
and hence genes, from two women as well as their fathers.
<br>
<p>Writing in the journal Human Reproduction, the researchers say that this &quot;is 
<br>
the first case of human germline genetic modification resulting in normal 
<br>
healthy children&quot;.
<br>
<p>'Great reservations'
<br>
<p>British experts have severely criticised the development.
<br>
<p>Infertility pioneer Lord Winston of the Hammersmith Hospital in London told 
<br>
BBC News Online that he had great reservations about it.
<br>
<p>&quot;Regarding the treatment of the infertile, there is no evidence that this 
<br>
technique is worth doing,&quot; he said. &quot;I am very surprised that it was even 
<br>
carried out at this stage. It would certainly not be allowed in Britain.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is no evidence that this is a possible valuable treatment for 
<br>
infertility,&quot; he added.
<br>
<p>Lord Winston said that, although the number of additional genes involved was 
<br>
tiny, it was in principle the wrong thing to do.
<br>
<p>The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the body that 
<br>
monitors and regulates UK reproductive medical activities, told BBC News 
<br>
Online that it was aware of the technique but had decided not to allow it in 
<br>
the UK because of its uncertainties and the possible alteration of the human 
<br>
germline.
<br>
<p>'Back door'
<br>
<p>The HFEA said it was an unwelcome development that &quot;adds additional concern&quot; 
<br>
to their worries. US researchers have also criticised the production of 
<br>
genetically altered children.
<br>
<p>Eric Juengst, of Case Western Reserve University, said: &quot;It should trouble 
<br>
those committed to transparent public conversation about the prospect of 
<br>
using 'reprogenetic' technologies to shape future children.&quot;
<br>
<p>The US Government Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee told BBC News Online 
<br>
that the researchers had carried out this work without government money.
<br>
<p>The committee said that in no circumstances would it consider any request 
<br>
for government funds that would result in modification of the human 
<br>
germline.
<br>
<p>Professor Joe Cummins, of the University of Western Ontario in Canada, told 
<br>
BBC News Online: &quot;Now is not the time to bring in human germline gene 
<br>
therapy through the back door.&quot;
