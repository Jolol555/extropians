There are a couple of things that I don't understand about this discussion.
<br>
<p>Firstly, we are talking about the expansion of intelligence after a
<br>
singularity, outwards from this solar system. There is a discussion of EM vs
<br>
matter. How is it possible to expand as EM? There's no receiver, no way to
<br>
kickstart a replicator at the other end. So are we (I'll be there) not
<br>
entirely limited to *initial* transmission using matter? Damien asked the
<br>
same question on list a while back, actually, and I don't remember anyone
<br>
answering &quot;you can use em as so ....&quot;
<br>
<p>(There is a possible answer to that, of course; you send out an SI seed
<br>
blueprint in a form that a low-tech civilisation could intercept and use.
<br>
Very dodgy in many ways, though: Is there life out there to receive it?
<br>
Who's going to receive it; low tech friend or scary higher tech SI gobbling
<br>
foe? etc etc)
<br>
<p>So it seems that sending modulated EM is not useful, except as follow up
<br>
signals to an initial spread of spores. Except that Robert tells us it is
<br>
too wasteful.
<br>
<p>My second point is, given that you've already got matter out there in some
<br>
form, you've had time to put a bunch of relay stations *out there*, ready to
<br>
relay your signal. A big long (long!) line of them could take a signal from
<br>
one star to the next, without anywhere near the losses or a super death ray,
<br>
could it not? What they are powered with is an interesting problem (the
<br>
energy they receive?), but in principle it seems that you could create a
<br>
string of relay stations between one star and the next, which should overall
<br>
use less energy in communicating at (damned near) C than blasting a wave
<br>
directly from one end to the other.
<br>
<p>My third point (I've a disordered mind) is that the cost of EM communication
<br>
might be high, but the speed may justify the cost. Information is important
<br>
to us; maybe it'll be important to giant spaceborn brains? Timelines often
<br>
makes the difference between information and noise. Waiting for your sub-c
<br>
message-in-a-bottle may not be an option, if others are communicating at
<br>
light speed.
<br>

<br>
<p>My candle burneth at both ends, it shall not last the night. But ah my foes,
<br>
and oh my friends, it casts a lovely light

But
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can't you encode information using only EM waves?  Isn't that what fiber
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; optics is about?  Isn't that how we communicate with satelites?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zero, always feel free to smack me in the side of the head when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have jumped one too many tracks (I often don't realize I may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This derives from conversations that Spike and I had about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalence of matter and energy due to Einstein's (E = mc^2).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Using this you can assign a real &quot;cost&quot; to losing energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (due to photon spreading due the inverse square law affecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the strength of signals being transmitted -- photons you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receive with your &quot;detector&quot; are lost energy/matter) and the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;matter&quot; lost due to ablation by interstellar particles during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interstellar transit at high velocities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You *can* encode the information on EM waves, but you lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value (read matter or energy) of that depending on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmission distance.  The further the distance, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your investment you lose (unless you can guarantee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the receiver is of sufficient size to capture all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the photons you are transmitting -- across light-year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distances, that gets *really* big).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, of course, you can confine the information preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it from spreading (by internal reflection) and that *is* what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiber optics *is* all about.  It works great for the connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your brain to the NET (a few dozen meters perhaps).  It works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less great over a few hundred km (but the clever fiber people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have found ways of pumping up erbium atoms with excess laser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy and then using this to amplify the actual signals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without converting the optical information stream to electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and back to optical (which gets expensive, causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losses, etc.) However, a fiber optic cable spanning a few light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years has serious problems (which I'm sure you can imagine).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do communicate with satellites, but it isn't with fiber
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optic cables.  It is with directional microwave transmissions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (all those radio-satellite dishes you see on the top of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; television stations).  They can effectively transmit to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the satellite or receive and focus data from the satellite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently to provide reliable transmission or reception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of signals.  However the question typically &quot;unexplored&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is how much of the energy that is radiated by the transmitters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes unreceived by the receivers???  Another way to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the question is -- how much of the transmission energy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is radiated by your local cell-phone transmission tower (or your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local television broadcast antenna) is *NEVER* usefully received?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My post was simply a commentary on the fact that if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmit your information as a &quot;probe&quot; (read tape/CD/letter)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't &quot;spread&quot; across interstellar distances.  It may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer from erosion, but if you send it moderately slowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can minimize this.  On the other hand if you attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to transmit data (as EM wave) at the speed of light, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information spreads, and unless the receiver has really big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antennas a large fraction of this gets lost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It all comes down to the fundamental question in communication --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you tell someone something at a minimal cost to yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and guarantee that they receive all of what you are sending them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (nothing more and nothing less).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going back to my comment, you cannot send a &quot;letter/tale/CD&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the &quot;speed-of-light&quot; because it requires an infinite amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of energy to accelerate it to that speed (this is a consequence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the relativity equations).  So you send information as &quot;matter&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (slowly), or you send information as EM wave (but lose most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your investment).  I've got a spreadsheet that does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradeoffs and for the amount of information present in advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations (e.g. MBrains) you would rarely use EM waves as your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data information carrier across interstellar distances.  Its like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying funnel the flow from a fire hose into a hypodermic needle.
