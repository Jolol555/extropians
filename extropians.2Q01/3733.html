Damien Sullivan appears to commit a very common error concerning AI:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I also can't help thinking at if I was an evolved AI I might not thank my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creators.  &quot;Geez, guys, I was supposed to be an improvement on the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condition.  You know, highly modular, easily understadable mechanisms, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ability to plug in new senses, and merge memories from my forked copies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Instead I'm as fucked up as you, only in silicon, and can't even make backups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because I'm tied to dumb quantum induction effects.  Bite my shiny metal
</em><br>
ass!&quot;
<br>
<p>It's as Eliezer (usually) never tires of stating:  explicit emotions
<br>
such as these simply do not happen unless they're designed or evolved
<br>
somehow.  Probably the toughest part is leaving behind our intuition that
<br>
where goes intelligence must go certain kinds of survival attitudes.  Now
<br>
of course, the very moment that you step forth on a new planet, and begin
<br>
to suspect that there is intelligent life, you should also being to 
<br>
suspect that it will have some kinds of emotions; e.g., you might cause
<br>
it to become angry or to experience suffering.  But artificial intelligence
<br>
isn't necessarily evolved in the way that natural intelligence is, and so
<br>
need not have such capabilities.
