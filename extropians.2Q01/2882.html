<p>Yes, but it's still **contingent**, in the larger scheme of things.
<br>
Human beings occupy an evolutionary niche characterized by aggregation
<br>
into highly interdependent social groups.  There are certain
<br>
strategies which are good for getting along in such a situation
<br>
(which, I suppose, are inherent in the universe to the extent that
<br>
they are universal characteristics of life in such groups, and can
<br>
be abstracted in the mathematical discourse of game theory).
<br>
To some extent, learning about the politics of living in such social
<br>
groups, about the things you need to pay attention to and the rules of
<br>
thumb you need to follow to avoid pissing other people off too much, has been
<br>
genetically &quot;streamlined&quot; in humans, just like language acquisition has
<br>
been genetically &quot;streamlined&quot;.  And, in fact, the folks with disabilities
<br>
in this regard get a fair amount of press -- some of them we call
<br>
&quot;autistic&quot;, and others we call &quot;psychopaths&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, note that people are also all-too-easily inclined to cheat whenever
<br>
the benefits outweigh the costs, or the likelihood of getting
<br>
caught is low, and to put the best face on their behavior by deceiving
<br>
others **and** themselves.  Even a single individual has multiple latent
<br>
strategies for making hay in the social group, which are active or
<br>
suppressed depending on one's position in the social hierarchy.  What
<br>
one is willing to put up with, or willing to inflict on others, is
<br>
heavily influenced by one's rank in the dominance hierarchy, as is well
<br>
documented in fiction and folklore.
<br>
<p>And **of course** the particular instantiations of whatever
<br>
universal moral precepts are built into the human condition
<br>
are also heavily influenced by the circumstances of particular
<br>
societies -- especially the physical circumstances.  Groups
<br>
living under conditions of great physical hardship, for example,
<br>
are known for customs that are likely to shock us &quot;soft&quot; Westerners --
<br>
like Eskimos leaving grandma to die on an ice floe when her teeth are
<br>
too worn down to chew the blubber anymore.
<br>
<p>Now, it's arguable whether the kind of tool-making and language-
<br>
based intelligence that humans have developed on
<br>
this planet **needs** the kind of social matrix it had here
<br>
on Earth, and therefore also goes hand in hand with the
<br>
kind of morality we're used to.  Questions about what kind of
<br>
morality an advanced extraterrestrial civilization is likely to
<br>
have are as controversial as similar questions about artificial
<br>
intelligence.  Take your pick -- you can have the somewhat
<br>
saccharine view of the likes of Carl Sagan, who was sure that
<br>
any ET civilization greatly superior to us technologically
<br>
would also have to be greatly superior to us morally (if only
<br>
to have been able to survive its own technology), **or**, you
<br>
can pick the more interesting and realistic (IMO) view of
<br>
somebody like Gregory Benford (in _Eater_) or David Brin (in
<br>
his Uplift books) that an ET civilization is just as likely
<br>
to have a seamy underside as our own (*).
<br>
<p>We wouldn't call what a cat does to a small animal it's
<br>
found &quot;immoral&quot;, even though most of us probably find such
<br>
a scene distasteful.  It's interesting, though, that cats
<br>
are often symbols of evil, along with bats, snakes, and
<br>
spiders -- the animals images used for Halloween decorations.
<br>
I was also amused to see that in _The Book of Lost Tales_,
<br>
the posthumously-published predecessor of J. R. R. Tolkien's
<br>
_The Silmarillion_, the forerunner of Sauron in the
<br>
earliest version of the Beren and Luthien story is Tevildo,
<br>
Prince of Cats.  So cats are creatures of the Devil, whereas
<br>
dogs are friends and servants of the Valar (e.g., Huan,
<br>
the Hound of Valinor).  However, the salient ethological
<br>
distinction is that cats are solitary hunters, whereas
<br>
dogs, while also carnivores, know about the protocols of
<br>
living in packs, which makes them more endearing to human
<br>
beings.
<br>
<p>Jim F.
<br>
<p>(*)
<br>
<p>&quot;Like most species derived from wholly carnivorous forbears,
<br>
the Tandu were difficult clients...
<br>
<p>The Tandu have remarkably low empathy for other sapient life-
<br>
forms.  They are members of a pseudo-religious alignment
<br>
whose tenets propose the eventual extermination of species
<br>
judged 'unworthy'.  While they observe the codes of the
<br>
Galactic Institutes, the Tandu make no secret of their desire
<br>
for a less-crowded universe...
<br>
<p>While waiting for this millennium, the Tandu... join in any
<br>
war of enforcement declared by the Galactic Institutes,
<br>
whatever the cause, and are often cited for the use of excess
<br>
force.  'Accidental extinction' of at least three spacefaring
<br>
species has been attributed to them...
<br>
<p>The Tandu are under long-term investigation for excessive
<br>
genetic manipulation in making the two [client races] totally
<br>
dependent instruments of their love of the hunt...
<br>
<p>'Nice people, these Tandu,' Gillian thought...
<br>
<p>Of course, Gillian already knew some things about... these
<br>
secretive, brutal enemies of Mankind.  This report only
<br>
reinforced her feeling that there was something terribly
<br>
wrong with a universe that had such monsters in it.
<br>
<p>Gillian had once spent a summer reading ancient space-romances
<br>
from pre-Contact days.  How open and friendly those old-time
<br>
fictional universes had seemed!  Even the rare 'pessimistic'
<br>
ones hadn't come close to the closed, confined, dangerous
<br>
reality.&quot;
<br>
<p>-- David Brin, _Startide Rising_
<br>
<p>I know I've seen even pithier passages than this in which Brin
<br>
takes pot-shots at the Saganesque sweetness-and-light view
<br>
of ETs, but I can't find them :-( .
<br>
<p>I was corrupted at a very early age with the taint of moral
<br>
relativism ;-&gt;, by a scene in the old _Outer Limits_ episode
<br>
&quot;A Feasibility Study&quot;:
<br>
<p>LUMINOID AUTHORITY:  ... We elders sit here doomed, immobile,
<br>
unable to do anything but think.  And there is our compensation.
<br>
Since no single fraction of life energy is wasted on meaningless
<br>
movement, all energy, all the mad monstrous force of it is
<br>
made available to the mind.  Can you comprehend the scope
<br>
and skill of minds that are never drained, never dulled... ?
<br>
<p>DR. SIMON HOLM:  I cannot conceive of such minds sanctioning
<br>
the abduction of innocent people.
<br>
<p>LUMINOID AUTHORITY:  Ha, ha.  Nothing is so modifiable as
<br>
morality.  Until recently, our youngsters produced the end
<br>
products of our dreams.  But now they rebel, and we are helpless,
<br>
and there is so much work to be done...
<br>
<p>I'm surprised that bit of dialog got past the ABC censors.
<br>
Ah, the corrupting influence of television on the youth of
<br>
America ;-&gt; .
