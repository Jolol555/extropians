----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: Robin Hanson &lt;<a href="mailto:rhanson@gmu.edu?Subject=Re:%20How%20To%20Live%20In%20A%20Simulation&In-Reply-To=&lt;009301c0acfa$35ddbe60$9f5be218@hala1.on.home.com&gt;">rhanson@gmu.edu</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;&gt;We have good evidence that if we are in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;simulation then our descendents want the simulation to be at least single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;blind. &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I thought of this but rejected it.
</em><br>
Well, what did you think the chances are that I--a mere simulation--would
<br>
have an original thought! The simulation, after all, is in a loop--the
<br>
eternal reoccurence of the same event.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the actual history of our descendants
<br>
<em>&gt; included many people who believed that they were living in a simulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it could be all right if a similar number of people in a simulated
</em><br>
world
<br>
<em>&gt; believe this.  It might in fact be a problem if too few people so
</em><br>
believed.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree. But your argument needs more than the possibility that this is
<br>
correct. It all depends on the motivations of the experimenters. If the
<br>
experimenters want to see what happens in worlds where the &quot;victims&quot; are not
<br>
aware of the simulation then, we ought to act as if we are not in a
<br>
simulation. (Given that we believe that they snuff out simulations that
<br>
become self-conscious of their plight).  On the other hand, if the
<br>
experimenters want to look at what happens when creatures become aware of
<br>
the fact that they are mere simulations then, perhaps your advice is
<br>
correct. I am not sure the evidence at this point can adjudicate between
<br>
these hypotheses. We can imagine evidence that might make your proposed
<br>
course of action more rational, e.g., suppose the stars in the night sky
<br>
were rearranged in a pattern that said 'this world is only a simulation'. I
<br>
think in this case I might be more inclined to take your advice about how to
<br>
live in a simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If if our nearer descendants are not complete fools, many of them will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously entertain this idea.  Nick is right that &quot;the naive
</em><br>
transhumanist
<br>
<em>&gt; dogma that we or our descendants will become posthumans who'll run
</em><br>
ancestor-
<br>
<em>&gt; simulations is false.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Again, it depends on the motivations of the experimenters. If the point of
<br>
the simulation is to see what happens if you create a world in which all
<br>
probability assignments are screwed up because everyone in the simulation
<br>
has a screwed up sense of probabilty, then Nick might be wrong. (Because of
<br>
course he is one of the victims). Or worse, suppose the point of the
<br>
simulation is to see what the world looks like if all the participants are
<br>
given a faulty logic as part of their reasoning processes. They might
<br>
operate in the world of the dialethics who believe there are true
<br>
contradictions. They slap their knees (and don't slap their knees) everytime
<br>
someone invokes the principle of contradiction. If our world is a simulation
<br>
then I am not sure there is anything that we can be sure about with respect
<br>
to our beliefs or actions. Virtually yours,  Mark.
