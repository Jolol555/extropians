<p>Okay, I see the point of dispute.  I strongly doubt that we've evolved to
<br>
chunk our abilities a certain way, or indeed to chunk them any way at all,
<br>
but that's not the point.  You can obviously come up with a metric for any
<br>
variety of &quot;intelligence&quot; you like, from plumbing intelligence to
<br>
Broderick-novel-plot-recall-intelligence.  But the true, underlying
<br>
components of intelligence - the ones that correspond to hardware - are
<br>
neither heartwarming, nor convenient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and to recognize them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in action, just as we have with colors out of a continuous spectrum?
</em><br>
<p>One of the reasons we know that color recognition is evolved is that all
<br>
languages follow a certain hierarchy of color distinctions and, within
<br>
that hierarchy, they all name the same colors.  The eleven basic color
<br>
categories - black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, purple, pink,
<br>
orange, and gray - are not all within all languages, but in those
<br>
languages where they are present, they always refer to the same color
<br>
prototypes; and in those languages that have fewer basic categories, the
<br>
basic categories are always some union of the basic terms listed.  When a
<br>
language has only two basic color terms, they are &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot;, or
<br>
rather &quot;cool&quot; (black, blue, green, gray) and &quot;warm&quot; (white, yellow,
<br>
orange, red).  When a language has three basic color terms, they are
<br>
black, white, red.  When a language has four basic color terms, the fourth
<br>
is one of the following: yellow, blue, green.
<br>
<p>The actual hierarchy is:
<br>
<p>black, white
<br>
red
<br>
yellow, blue, green
<br>
brown
<br>
purple, pink, orange, gray
<br>
<p>A language that has a word for pink will always have words for brown,
<br>
green, and red.
<br>
<p>(&quot;Basic Color Terms&quot;, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay, 1969.  As summarized in
<br>
&quot;Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things:  What Categories Reveal about the
<br>
Mind&quot; by George Lakoff.)
<br>
<p>Demonstrate a similar set of language-level distinctions for intelligence
<br>
categories and your name will live forever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think just for the moment I'll go along with Howard Gardner and Jerome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bruner and those guys who've been working in this area for the last few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades, and take Eliezer's guess as an interesting `sidewalk supervisor'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion.
</em><br>
<p>Heh.  Well, that's your decision.  Just bear in mind that where an
<br>
academic field has been corrupted by political influences, it's very easy
<br>
for people who have been working there for &quot;decades&quot; to be totally,
<br>
flagrantly, utterly wrong.  I'd trust an amateur reader of &quot;The Adapted
<br>
Mind&quot; over any academic trained in the &quot;soft&quot; social sciences when it
<br>
comes to knowing, for example, &quot;whether the brain has domain specificity
<br>
or is a general learning machine&quot;, because it is known that the standard
<br>
social sciences model is blatantly untrue, for political reasons, with
<br>
respect to that particular question.
