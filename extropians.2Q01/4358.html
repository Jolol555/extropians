<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which is all fine and good except when it gives you the WRONG ANSWER.
</em><br>
<p>This is begging the question, of course.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In this case, &quot;could&quot; may be more convenient (why?) but it is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the word problem.
</em><br>
<p>It's very much more convenient not to have to specify hypotheses.
<br>
But more importantly, from the statement &quot;I have two children and
<br>
one is a girl&quot;, we don't (in mathematics) have to think about
<br>
whether or not King Herod has been ordering parents of girls
<br>
to appear somewhere and give evidence, or whether a parent flips
<br>
his children into the air and reports on the one that lands first,
<br>
or whether some entirely other real-world procedure was employed.
<br>
Mathematics is the art of abstracting away all of that.  Moreover,
<br>
<p>the art of mathematical problems consists in finding the relevant
<br>
pure abstract situation that applies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Our entire real world consists of &quot;did&quot;, not &quot;could&quot;.  &quot;Could&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the rational construct; &quot;did&quot; is the observed reality.
</em><br>
<p>Well, not quite.  Should we go further and find out an empirical
<br>
answer to the question &quot;What did the mathematician say?&quot;?  After
<br>
all, (talking about the real world), how many people really *do*
<br>
take such a statement to a mathematician?  Should we go test 
<br>
whether the random processes employed were reliable?  (Real
<br>
statisticians would!)  The whole situation of my problem is
<br>
clearly contrived, and even meant to be funny (like what kind
<br>
of idiot would take his doubts about the sex of his unborn
<br>
child to a mathematician)?
<br>
<p>In the real world, statisticians get real problems from real
<br>
customers.  It is expected that they will thoroughly research
<br>
any number of hypotheses, often taking weighted averages of
<br>
what they find, in order to submit the most probably guess
<br>
about a real world phenomenon.  This is admirable, of course,
<br>
but it is entirely different from the world of asking little
<br>
mathematics puzzles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you want to pose a mathematical problem, you should use a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pure mathematical language, or a word problem with no flexibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the priors.
</em><br>
<p>Again, whether or not the priors are flexible is a question that
<br>
I've *never* seen in mathematics problems.  This is definitely
<br>
a statisticians approach.  Ask mathematicians &quot;what are the priors?&quot;
<br>
and in many cases you'll get a blank look; only those, I submit,
<br>
who are acquainted with statistical procedures will instantly know
<br>
what you are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To put it another way, Bayesian probabilities automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;govern all problems that are posed in real-world language, and
</em><br>
<p>Right.  Hopefully no one would think &quot;a man, uncertain what the
<br>
sex his unborn child was, decided to consult a mathematician&quot; is
<br>
a real world problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...if you want to pose a purely mathematical question in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;language, you need to eliminate any Bayesian ambiguities.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you don't, then somebody who gives a &quot;common-sense but wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answer&quot; that is actually correct gets to gloat over you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead of vice versa.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry; you're quite right.  *Gloating* is never justified,
<br>
and the real purpose of cute mathematical problems is the same
<br>
as the purpose of any interesting tidbit that one might want
<br>
to throw out.  We're not trying to just show off; we expose our
<br>
beliefs to criticism, and also hope that there will be an
<br>
exchange of wisdom.  We hope to be enlightened.
<br>
<p>Well, this has been enlightening indeed!  All my life I felt 
<br>
deprived because I didn't know what the controversy surrounding
<br>
the &quot;Bayesians&quot; and &quot;Non-Bayesians&quot; was, and at one point, it
<br>
was the only intellectual controversy I knew of that I felt 
<br>
excluded from.  Perhaps I've finally gotten involved.  
<br>
<p>Even better, my problem about the man who didn't know the sex
<br>
of his unborn child---and I elided a sentence about how he wanted
<br>
a boy, and so &quot;cleverly&quot; went to a mathematician---now evidently
<br>
has even richer structure:  it can be used to explain the difference
<br>
between a Bayesian and a Non-Bayesian approach.  Only one question
<br>
remains:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Vorlon voice:) &quot;We are all Bayesian statisticians.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>'zat so?  You mean I missed out on the controversy after all?  :-(
