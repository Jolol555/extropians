<p>
Even if theologicians formulate their theologies in untestable terms
<br>
(for whatever reasons), it doesn't mean religion loses its
<br>
strength. Most religious people don't care strongly about the details
<br>
about how evolution *really* happened or how souls interface the
<br>
physical world, since the important thing to them is the emotional,
<br>
social and spiritual effects of their religion. They might quote
<br>
scripture to defend it, since an attack on some of the system is
<br>
interpreted as an attack on the to them important parts. They might
<br>
simply say that faith is more important than logic and science, and I
<br>
think that is a correct description of how many value their religion:
<br>
its value is found in the realm of subjective experience, not
<br>
objective facts. Since we on this list are very fond of objective
<br>
reality, we tend to miss the difference in emphasis. 
<br>
<p>I predict that even with a complete TOE, explaining not just how the
<br>
physical laws work but also why the TOE is the one, a perfect
<br>
understanding of the brain allowing us to upload people in completely
<br>
deterministic computers and technology to perform every miracle in
<br>
every holy book ever written, there will be people who are still
<br>
religious. And it will not be because they dont understand all of
<br>
this, but because they consider the meaning of it to still remain in
<br>
the spiritual sphere. Even if you can show the entire universe to be a
<br>
neatly completed closed causal loop, they can say &quot;OK, but who created
<br>
it?&quot;. We might scoff at this, whipping out our Occam razors, and in
<br>
this scenario it is likely that very many would find meaning and
<br>
spirituality in other things than classical religion, but it still
<br>
seems likely these people would persist and feel themselves to be
<br>
justified in persisting.  Creo quia absurdum...
