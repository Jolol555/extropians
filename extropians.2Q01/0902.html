I just wanted to add an illustration to my
<br>
previous remarks on this thread.
<br>
<p>I airily generalized:
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The persistence of &quot;that old-time religion&quot; in the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is simply due to some groups of people having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been insufficently exposed to the web of consilience,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very largely, I think, due to the unavailability or ineffectiveness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of education.  When young adults jettison, for instance, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief in special creation they've been bought up with in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the modern secular view of dinosaurs, and Darwin, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4.5-billion-year-old Earth, it usually happens not because they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been bullied into it, but because they're reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bright to begin with, and they've gone off to college
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and been exposed to the big bad modern web of belief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The enormous intellectual appeal of consilience and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-consistency gives the modern scientific web of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief a tremendous advantage when it comes to colonizing halfway-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellgent brains.  You don't have to attend Evolutionists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anonymous meetings to continue to believe in Darwin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's the smaller, coarser-grained, less-well-knitted webs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional religious doctrines that require an enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ongoing amount of social support to hold together.
</em><br>
<p>The most vivid account I've read of somebody jettisoning
<br>
a religious upbringing and embracing the &quot;modern scientific
<br>
web of belief&quot; as a result of having an opportunity to attend
<br>
college popped back into my working memory today.  This
<br>
account was in the 1995 book _All-American Boy: A Memoir_
<br>
by M. Scott Peck (the paperback version was subtitled
<br>
&quot;Growing Up Gay in God's Country&quot;):
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684870479">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684870479</a>
<br>
<p>The young author of this book received some notoriety
<br>
when his father, an officer in the Marines, testified
<br>
before Congress that he did not believe that homosexuals
<br>
should be permitted to serve in the armed forces, even
<br>
though his own son was gay.  A 1995 review of the book
<br>
from the _Seattle Times_
<br>
( <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/withak/nf-allamericanboy.htm">http://www.halcyon.com/withak/nf-allamericanboy.htm</a> )
<br>
states:
<br>
<p>&quot;Scott Peck's homosexuality is the least of it. Growing up
<br>
in the deep South, he and his mother were caught between the
<br>
physical abuse of his stepfather--a horrific drunk who
<br>
belt-whipped her on the front lawn--and the spiritual abuse
<br>
of her parents, strict Calvinists, who told the boy his mother
<br>
wanted him aborted. All the while Scott struggled to hide his
<br>
burgeoning homosexuality with the small cloth of Christian
<br>
Fundamentalism. He even considered becoming a preacher. 
<br>
<p>Ironically, the least intriguing aspect of the book is
<br>
Scott's 'coming out'. Yeah yeah, another glimpse into gay
<br>
lifestyle. Another trip to that bar. Better is the glimpse
<br>
Scott Peck gives us of the Christian South. You mean there
<br>
are still places in America where charismatics speak in
<br>
tongues? Where conversions are attempted with a Bible in one
<br>
hand and the other curled into a fist? Where newsletters
<br>
are titled _Thank God for AIDS_? How strange! How monumentally
<br>
queer!&quot;
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the copy of the book that was once on my
<br>
shelf seems to have succumbed to quantum evaporation, but
<br>
to paraphrase from memory, the author describes how
<br>
compelling it was for him to listen to college lectures
<br>
alluding, for example, to Darwinian evolution and the vast
<br>
age of the earth.  The other students in these classes listened
<br>
in various attitudes of distraction or boredom because,
<br>
Mr. Peck explains, they had heard most of it before.  But for him,
<br>
it was like discovering an entirely new world.
<br>
<p>My friend Joe Fineman, on hearing this story, was compelled
<br>
to counter that, while he was willing to believe that Peck's
<br>
account is typical of the direction in which belief **usually**
<br>
changes in such circumstances, he had also heard a story
<br>
about a geologist who, after having been professionally
<br>
trained to believe that the earth is billions of years old,
<br>
had then converted to Christian fundamentalism, adopting
<br>
an elaborate explanation of why his former beliefs had been
<br>
erroneous.  My friend did not remember any of the details
<br>
of the social context in which the geologist's conversion
<br>
had taken place.  :-&gt;
