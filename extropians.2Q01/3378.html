<p><em>&gt;I dunno, I never thought cryonics as funny. Sick and creepy maybe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but never funny. It helps talking to the people who're doing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and watching a video of the procedure. It's still not pretty (unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you're the type who's horsing around during practical anatomy lessons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as medical student) but it will help adjust your attitude.
</em><br>
<p><p>I have a couple of contributions to this note.
<br>
<p>1) Eight years ago Keith Henson posted a message to the extropians
<br>
list describing the medical procedure that precedes the part
<br>
where cryoprotectives are prefused in the patient. The beginning of
<br>
his message is the following:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I wrote up how you go about putting in heart bypass plumbing--which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary before perfusing patients with cryoprotectives.  Thought the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;wet work&quot; phase of cryonics might interest a few of you.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;squeamish should skip the rest now.
</em><br>
<p>I think that Keith provided a very valuable service by describing
<br>
it. Nothing substitutes practical information and knowledge,
<br>
especially about a topic which is often considered &quot;abstract&quot;
<br>
(&quot;uploading&quot;, etc.). I remembered Keith's post really well because I
<br>
gave him an ASCII &quot;Squishiest Extropians Post&quot; award, and I believe
<br>
that my stomach was queasy enough after his post that I skipped
<br>
lunch that day.
<br>
<p>Instead of posting the &quot;plumbing&quot; description here, I have placed
<br>
the description at my web site (not permanently however):
<br>
<a href="http://www.amara.com/plumbing.txt">http://www.amara.com/plumbing.txt</a>
<br>
<p><p>2) If you're a person like me who spends a huge amount of time in
<br>
an abstract world (me, working with astronomy data), the world of
<br>
other people's lives is sometimes shoved to the background. I
<br>
think that one of the best ways to experience &quot;hard people issues&quot;
<br>
and to become grounded in reality is to spend time in a hospital
<br>
(any kind of hospital). I don't think that a person can experience
<br>
reality any closer than that.
<br>
<p>My own experience in a hospital was actually in a pathology lab.
<br>
When I was starting a small programming project several years ago to
<br>
write a Web interface to a breast cancer tumor SQL database for a
<br>
local hospital, the pathologist in charge of the project spent
<br>
several hours leading me through all of the steps that the doctors
<br>
perform when they diagnose tumor cells from breast cancer patients.
<br>
I know now how malignant tumor cells under the microscope appear
<br>
from women who will die in several months. For me, life and death
<br>
became much more real when I saw that graphical evidence.  If
<br>
you _really_ want to know the state of cancer research,
<br>
*please* spend time in a pathlogist's lab. You will discover that
<br>
the cancer researchers are fighting a hard battle.
