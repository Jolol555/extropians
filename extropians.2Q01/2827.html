<p>Spike, 
<br>
<p>My take on this is that they aren't concerned with what the world thinks.
<br>
(Everyone outside of China knows what happened, the Chinese fighter jock
<br>
screwed up, killed himself, and brought down the spy plane and its crew.)
<br>
They're interested in controlling the spin on the story inside China.
<br>
Which, presumably they can easily do because they have a lock on the
<br>
Chinese media.  Since there's nothing to be gained by those in power by
<br>
telling the truth on this one, they're telling the most advantageous lie.
<br>
Just like news organizations and governments everywhere. 
<br>
<p>I'm with Neal B. on this one, who says,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think this whole spy plane thing is so boring and &quot;old world.&quot; Snore. Who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cares what the little monkeys do to each other &amp; their toys? It's so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incredibly juvenile and entropic. As long as we expend energy on this crap,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we'll never be able to leave it behind. Grow up, primates!
</em><br>
<p>In this barely modern age, only a human still trapped in infantilism
<br>
accepts anything offered by any cultural information distribution system
<br>
without intense skepticism and savage cynicism.  The world is the place it
<br>
is because so many are still infants, in thrall to mobsters.  Grow up,
<br>
primates!
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
