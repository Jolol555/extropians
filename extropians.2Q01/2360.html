<em>&gt; &gt; Most atheists I've met would not say &quot;god doesn't exist&quot;, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would say they don't believe it exists. They're well aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the problem of making such sweeping claims. By default, atheism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is merely a lack of god belief. It can also be a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;assertion of nonexistence&quot;, but this in my experience is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less common, and atheism tends to be described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that way in order to strawman it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, I'll say it flatly: God does not exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Would you say that Santa Claus exists? Or would you be discreetly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-commital? After all, can you prove that Santa Claus does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exist?
</em><br>
<p>I have no belief in Santa Claus.  I'll believe it when evidence is 
<br>
presented for it.  Until then I'll lack belief in him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While agnostics are people who don't have a strong claim in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter, most are really atheists under the Santa Claus test.
</em><br>
<p>In so far as they lack belief yes.  I'd agree on that.  What's known as 
<br>
&quot;weak&quot; atheism is quite similar to agnosticism.  Neither are blanket 
<br>
statements of non-belief.  Their agnosticism relates to their opinions on 
<br>
the God matter solely.  Each claim is considered on its' own merits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They are merely unwilling to say so for some reason. They no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy than they believe in God,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but are merely &quot;agnostic&quot; about the latter (for some arcane reason).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yet they do not hesitate to express their strong belief that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;former do not exist.
</em><br>
<p>I've not yet met an agnostic who's agnostic with regards to Santa Claus or 
<br>
the Tooth Fairy, they're generally &quot;athiestic&quot; about them.  But they don't 
<br>
define themselves as agnositic by their stance on St. Nick or Fairies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The truth is, we can't prove anything.
</em><br>
<p>Yup, and that's why I simply lack belief in these kinds of claims.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;An educated 21st century
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person with good judgment has to stand by the statements that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Earth goes round the sun and God does not exist.
