<p>This is basic statistical and measurement technique.  However, the author is
<br>
right that these basic methods are screwed up much of the time, even by
<br>
scientists.
<br>
<p>One of the issues with this question is whether the problem even exists.  It
<br>
may or may not be true that people use radically different self-rating
<br>
scales when asked to rate their internal feelings on a scale from 1 to 10.
<br>
They might be radically different, which would invalidate much research, or
<br>
they might be radically similar, which would not invalidate much research.
<br>
There is a real possibility of a problem here, but it is not confirmed.
