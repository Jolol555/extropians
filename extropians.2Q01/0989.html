<em>&gt; &gt; You assume that misery will occur. Why? Surely beings smart enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-evolve can figure out how to avoid misery, as another list member
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; already indicated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can avoid misery if you disconnect key pathways involving in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determination that &quot;this life sucks&quot;.  Now that would be an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation where the sim-director receives the feedback that the
</em><br>
simulant
<br>
<em>&gt; feels the sim sucks, but the sumulant doesn't feel it at all.
</em><br>
<p>Pardon, perhaps I didn't form the question properly: Why do you assume
<br>
that misery will occur in SI? Beings smart enough to self-evolve can
<br>
surely figure out how to avoid misery, and so would not require the
<br>
surgery you mention.
<br>
One possible way SI can accomplish this avoidance is via suicide. That
<br>
would explain the Fermi paradox by asserting that pre-SI decides (by
<br>
purely reasonable and logical procedures) to end its trajectory before it
<br>
becomes any more unhappy. It always does this. That's the eternally
<br>
recurring life cycle. This scenario contains more verisimilitude than any
<br>
simulation theory, AFAIC.

<br>
free will
