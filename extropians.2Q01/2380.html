<p>Er...I don't remember mentioning memes.  Is that what you thought I was

talking about?

<p>What makes you think I believe the existence of the god idea has no effect 
<br>
on human experience?  If you can deduce that from what I wrote, then I 
<br>
guess I've just invented a new data compression technique, squeezing extraj 
<br>
meanings into what I thought were pretty straightforward statements.

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
