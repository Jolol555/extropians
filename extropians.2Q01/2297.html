There is an interesting article in the March 17 New Scientist called &quot;Cruel
<br>
to be Kind&quot; about the research work of Thomas Johnson. His lab site is here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://ibgwww.colorado.edu/tj-lab/index.html">http://ibgwww.colorado.edu/tj-lab/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>unfortunately I can't find the article online so far. But it talks about
<br>
how a little bit of radiation and other kinds of stress might actually be
<br>
a good thing. For instance studies of thousands of nuclear workers that
<br>
are exposed to something like 10 times the normal background radiation
<br>
live on average 17% longer than &quot;normal&quot; people, and have HALF the amount
<br>
of cancer. Also of interest is just the general fact that cancer used to
<br>
be far less common in the 19th and earlier centuries. Some people claim
<br>
this is due to people living longer in 20th century and other factors like
<br>
widespread smoking, but could it also be due to the fact that we are living
<br>
such stress-free (in terms of physical environment, not mental stress...)
<br>
lives that our immune systems are slacking off? The EPA is running a study
<br>
now on whether low-level radiation would be beneficial... by 2003 you may
<br>
be encouraged to take vitamins containing radionuclides.
