Subject: Re: My reaction...
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Page title:  &quot;Making HAL your Pal&quot;.  Good title.
<br>
<p>Page summary:  &quot;What happens when artificial intelligence becomes far
<br>
smarter than humans? What will keep it friendly? The Singularity Institute
<br>
says it as the answers for what happens during the next stage of
<br>
humanity's evolution. By Declan McCullagh.&quot;  Great summary.
<br>
<p>First sentence:  &quot;Eliezer Yudkowsky has devoted his young life to an
<br>
undeniably unusual pursuit...&quot;
<br>
<p>I guess I felt that there was too much about me, and who produced
<br>
&quot;Friendly AI&quot; and why and whether he was a nice person, rather than the
<br>
actual topic of Friendly AI and the Singularity.
<br>
<p>I'm young, Declan.  I didn't go to college or even high school.  What I
<br>
rely on, for my credentials, is not the fact that I once got an absurdly
<br>
high SAT score at age eleven; what I rely on is people looking at my
<br>
present-day work and seeing that it is good.  I have no objection to your
<br>
including that quote from whichever AI researcher it was, but I also wish
<br>
you'd gone into at least a little detail on something - said something
<br>
about probabilistic supergoals, for example - so that anyone with a
<br>
knowledge of cognitive science who reads the article can say:  &quot;Hm, that
<br>
sounds like an interesting idea for Friendly AI, I'd like to know a bit
<br>
more about it.&quot;  I didn't see anything in the article that would enable
<br>
people to do that.  There are things about my history, and about what
<br>
we're trying to do, and what other people think of it, and what people
<br>
think of the Singularity, and who invented the Singularity, but not
<br>
anything about what the Singularity *is*, or what, *specifically*,
<br>
&quot;Friendly AI&quot; suggests.  Even the words &quot;Friendliness is not imposed, it's
<br>
what the AI *wants* to do&quot;, would have been enough to intrigue people -
<br>
show them a little of the future shock, the strangeness of the
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>That's why I was enthused by the title and summary, but worried when I
<br>
read the first sentence.  I'd as soon turn grey and faceless and be just
<br>
another author's name on the page then permit my admittedly interesting
<br>
life story to get in the way of SIAI.
<br>
<p>Part of all this was simply my inexperience, of course.  In the future,
<br>
for example, I'll be careful to say:  &quot;Any damn fool can design a system
<br>
that will work right if nothing goes wrong.  That's why Friendly AI is
<br>
740K long.&quot;
<br>
<p>And no, the Singularity Institute doesn't have any code.  We *say* we
<br>
don't have any code.  We plaster that fact all over the place.  We *beg*
<br>
people for the funding we need to start writing code, and in the meantime,
<br>
we do what we can to make the Singularity safer.  And yet people, dammit,
<br>
don't just advise us to start writing code, which is one thing, but
<br>
actually get all *angry* at us for not having code?  How the devil do they
<br>
think code gets written?  By hiding out in the basement until you've
<br>
written a complete working AI?  How would people know we were worth
<br>
funding if we didn't do what we could in the meanwhile?
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Of course I expect a lot of hostile reactions.  The most I can hope for is
<br>
that I can accumulate a bunch of equal and opposite good reactions to use
<br>
to oppose it.  Any crackpot can say things like &quot;Einstein was mocked!
<br>
Drexler was mocked!&quot;, and the frequent use by crackpots of that line is
<br>
exactly why I try never to use it.  Still, a hostile reaction by a
<br>
distinguished scientist neither proves nor disproves a theory that would
<br>
be expected to be controversial.  You have to judge by looking at the
<br>
content.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>I forecast a good chance that the goverment will interfere and mess up the
<br>
Singularity.  Remember, Declan, I'm not necessarily doing this because I
<br>
forecast a large probability of success, but because these are the actions
<br>
that lead to the greatest available probability of success.
