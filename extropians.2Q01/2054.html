Frankenstein fears after head transplant
<br>
<p><p><p>A new brain could be available in the future
<br>
<p>A controversial operation to transplant the whole head of a monkey onto a 
<br>
different body has proved a partial success.
<br>
The scientist behind it wants to do the same thing to humans, but other 
<br>
members of the scientific community have condemned the experiments as 
<br>
&quot;grotesque&quot;.
<br>
<p>Professor Robert White, from Cleveland Ohio, transplanted a whole monkey's 
<br>
head onto another monkey's body, and the animal survived for some time after 
<br>
the operation.
<br>
<p>The professor told the BBC's Today programme how he believes the operation 
<br>
is the next step in the transplant world.
<br>
<p>And he raised the possibility that it could be used to treat people 
<br>
paralysed and unable to use their limbs, and whose bodies, rather than their 
<br>
brains, were diseased.
<br>
<p>&quot;People are dying today who, if they had body transplants, in the spinal 
<br>
injury community would remain alive.&quot;
<br>
<p>He said that in the experiment, his team had been able to: &quot;transplant the 
<br>
brain as a separate organ into an intact animal and maintain it in a viable, 
<br>
or living situation for many days.&quot;
<br>
<p>He added: &quot;We've been able to retain the brain in the skull, and in the 
<br>
head.&quot;
<br>
<p>That, he said meant the monkey was conscious, and that it could see, hear, 
<br>
taste and smell because the nerves were left intact in the head.
<br>
<p>He admitted that it could appear &quot;grotesque&quot;, but said there had been 
<br>
ethical considerations throughout the history of organ transplants.
<br>
<p>&quot;At each stage - kidney, heart, liver and so forth - ethical considerations 
<br>
have been considered, especially with the heart, which was a major, major 
<br>
problem for many people and scientists.
<br>
<p>&quot;And the brain, because of its uniqueness poses a major, major ethical issue 
<br>
as far as the public and even the profession is concerned.&quot;
<br>
<p>'Scientifically misleading'
<br>
<p>The arguments against head and brain transplants were outlined by Dr Stephen 
<br>
Rose, director of brain and behavioural research at the Open University.
<br>
<p>He said: &quot;This is medical technology run completely mad and out of all 
<br>
proportion to what's needed.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's entirely misleading to suggest that a head transplant or a brain 
<br>
transplant is actually really still connected in anything except in terms of 
<br>
blood stream to the body to which it has been transplanted.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's not controlling or relating to that body in any other sort of way.&quot;
<br>
<p>He added: &quot;It's scientifically misleading, technically irrelevant and 
<br>
scientifically irrelevant, and apart from anything else a grotesque breach 
<br>
of any ethical consideration.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a mystification to call it either a head transplant or a brain 
<br>
transplant.
<br>
<p>&quot;All you're doing is keeping a severed head alive in terms of the 
<br>
circulation from another animal. It's not connected in any nervous sense.&quot;
<br>
<p>The issue of who someone who had received a head transplant would &quot;be&quot; is 
<br>
extremely complicated, said Professor Rose.
<br>
<p>&quot;Your person is largely embodied but not entirely in your brain&quot;.
<br>
<p>He added: &quot;I cannot see any medical grounds for doing this. I cannot see 
<br>
that scientifically you would actually be able to regenerate the nerves 
<br>
which could produce that sort of control.
<br>
<p>&quot;And I think that the experiments are the sort that are wholly unethical and 
<br>
inappropriate for any possible reason.&quot;
<br>
<p>He added that the way to help the quadriplegic community was to work on 
<br>
research to help spinal nerves regenerate.
