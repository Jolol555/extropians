<em>&gt; ... the not-so-famous Ted Nelson... is a truly fascinating

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Writing before there was an Internet, or even before there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal computers, Nelson envisioned a world in which people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sit at computer screens in their own homes and read books on those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screens...  But the book they would be reading... would be hypertext.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...However, his project was considerably more difficult than he had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagined.  Some parts, the first parts, were easy.  There were many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard parts, however.  Too many.  He failed miserably.
</em><br>
<p>I e-mailed a friend quite recently:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ted Nelson..., decades ago, imagined the world's literature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being linked into a hypertext database.  He worked on his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of this dream -- the Xanadu system -- for years and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years.  It was going to do everything **right** -- permit quoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and commenting on copyrighted material while still compensating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the authors.  There was a none-too-flattering article in _Wired_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magazine a few years ago about Nelson and Xanadu and the history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all the wasted brilliance invested in that system.  Then, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Web popped into existence overnight, in an extremely anarchic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.  Nelson has been reduced to an embittered curmudgeon reminiscing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the way things might have been, and harrumphing about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way they are.
</em><br>
<p>If you're connected with computers and of a certain age, Ted Nelson
<br>
is likely to have been a big deal in your life.  I know that
<br>
running into _Computer Lib_ in 1977 made as big an impression on me as
<br>
running into Eliezer Yudkowsky's _Staring Into the Singularity_ did
<br>
in 1997 (and let's hope that the parallels between Nelson and
<br>
Yudkowsky end right there! :-/ ).
<br>
<p>The _Wired_ article about Xanadu is a very sad story indeed, and
<br>
probably cuts a little close to the bone for a lot of folks on this
<br>
list.  It's now available on-line at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/xanadu_pr.html</a>
<br>
<p>Ted Nelson's Web articles and grumps are at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/">http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/</a>
<br>
<p>And for an analysis that claims that any tightly-designed,
<br>
do-it-right approach to networked hypertext was doomed to failure,
<br>
and that all the things that are bad about the Web as we know and
<br>
love it (such as unidirectional links) were actually **necessary**
<br>
to its success, see:
