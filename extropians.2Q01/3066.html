As an ex software tester for MS, I can say MS only tests up to the point 
<br>
where the cost of test is not exceeded by some marketing goal, I personally 
<br>
know of  quite a few &quot;wont fix&quot; bugs that will never be fixed because of 
<br>
cost and timing considerations.
<br>
<p>It (test) is boring even if you do get paid, and software test is plagued 
<br>
with a eye of disrespect from &quot;real developers&quot; so that cynicism is rampant.
<br>
<p><p>This list doesn't have enough flames....

Microsoft: Closed source is more secure
<br>
Redmond's security response chief warns the RSA Conference of the perils
<br>
of open source.
<br>
By Kevin Poulsen

April 12, 2001 1:46 PM PT
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO--The head of Microsoft's security response team argued
<br>
here Thursday that closed source software is more secure than open
<br>
source projects, in part because nobody's reviewing open source code for
<br>
security flaws.
<br>
&quot;Review is boring and time consuming, and it's hard,&quot; said Steve Lipner,
<br>
manager of Microsoft's security response center. &quot;Simply putting the
<br>
source code out there and telling folks 'here it is' doesn't provide any
<br>
assurance or degree of likelihood that the review will occur.&quot;
<br>
The comments, delivered at the 2001 RSA Conference, were a challenge to
<br>
one of the tenets of open source, that 'with many eyes, all bugs are
<br>
shallow.'
<br>
&quot;The vendor eyes in a security review tend to be dedicated, trained,
<br>
full time and paid,&quot; Lipner said.
<br>
Lipner argued that network administrators are better off spending their
<br>
time reading log files and installing patches than poring over source
<br>
code looking for security holes, and the system of 'peer review' that
<br>
works well for vetting encryption algorithms, doesn't work to evaluate
<br>
large pieces of software for flaws.
<br>
&quot;An encryption algorithm is relatively simple, compared to a 40 million
<br>
line operating system,&quot; Lipner argued. &quot;And the discovery of an
<br>
individual software flaw doesn't pay off much... It doesn't win anyone
<br>
fame and fortune... People fix the flaw and move on.&quot;
<br>
Lipner, who oversees Microsoft's response to newly-reported security
<br>
holes in its products, took the opportunity to point out &quot;the repeated
<br>
and recurring vulnerabilities in the Unix utilities BIND, WU-FTP, and so
<br>
on. The repeated theme is people use this stuff, but they don't spend
<br>
time security reviewing.&quot;
<br>
'The open source model tends to emphasize design and development.
<br>
Testing is boring and expensive.'
<br>
-- Steve Lipner, Microsoft
<br>
Trapdoor risk?
<br>
Making source code public also increases the risk that attackers will
<br>
find a crucial security hole that reviewers missed, said Lipner. &quot;That
<br>
argument sounds like an argument for 'security through obscurity,' and I
<br>
apologize. The facts are there.&quot;
<br>
Lipner slammed the open source development process, suggesting that the
<br>
often-voluntary nature of creating works like the Linux operating system
<br>
make it less disciplined, and less secure. &quot;The open source model tends
<br>
to emphasize design and development. Testing is boring and expensive.&quot;
<br>
By contrast, Microsoft does extensive testing on every product, and on
<br>
every patch, said Lipner. &quot;People ask us why our security patches take
<br>
so long. One of the reasons they take so long is because we test them.&quot;
<br>
Lipner closed by warning that the nature of open source development may
<br>
lend itself to abuse by malicious coders, who could devilishly clever
<br>
'trapdoors' in the code that escapes detection, hidden in plain sight.
<br>
Under polite questioning from the audience, Lipner acknowledged that
<br>
some closed-source commercial products have been found to have trapdoors
<br>
themselves.
<br>
Other conferees expressed skepticism that closed source software
<br>
receives more thorough security reviews than open source code.
<br>
&quot;Looking at products that come from commercial vendors, it seems the
<br>
customer has very little guarantee that the software has been reviewed,&quot;
<br>
said one conferee. &quot;Industry has not acquitted itself well.&quot;
