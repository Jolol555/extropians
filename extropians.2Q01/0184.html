Neal asks about:
<br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0103/hypoth_eclipse.html">http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0103/hypoth_eclipse.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; . . . which left me scratching my head as to the author's intent. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems like an interesting bit of information, but the article as a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not very substantive. Maybe the author came across this info while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researching something else, and thought he had an article.
</em><br>
<p>I think I've heard this before, that the Eddington confirmation of General
<br>
Relativity was not as strong as the publicity implied.  It's certainly
<br>
true that observations are informed and guided by theory.  If you do an
<br>
experiment twice and get data conforming to the theory in one run and
<br>
contradicting it on the other, you'll probably accept the conforming data,
<br>
especially if the experiment is tricky and hard to do.
<br>
<p>This does mean that it takes longer to find out that we are on the
<br>
wrong foot, but after all, the proof is in the pudding.  Science has
<br>
done a pretty good job over the centuries and this bias has existed
<br>
all that time.  In a sense, we can say that a process of evolution
<br>
has been operating on the institution of science, and it has built in
<br>
a conservative bias.  Scientists are more successful who assume that
<br>
guiding theories are correct than to track down every flaky result with
<br>
the assumption that they are about to turn the world upside down.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that we're getting spin from what I assume is a book
<br>
skeptical of Einstein, &quot;Was Einstein Right?&quot;.  I suppose that Eddington
<br>
fully described his data reduction methods in his report, else the
<br>
skeptics would not have had these juicy details to chew on.  So he was
<br>
honest and open about it, and it was his professional judgement that these
<br>
results constituted a confirmation of Einstein's theories over Newton's.
<br>
If you disagree, well, he gave you the data you need to make your own
<br>
determination.
