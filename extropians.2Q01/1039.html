<em>&gt; &gt; Ethically, there is nothing wrong with making a simulation

</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I disagree.  Every conscious being
</em><br>
<p>Including cats and dogs? People with IQ &lt; 25?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is a citizen.
</em><br>
<p>Citizen of what? Sim City? And what rights rights does that confer? By what
<br>
authority?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every conscious being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the right to exist for vis own purpose, and to serve the purposes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others only with vis agreement.
</em><br>
<p>Kind of spoils the effect of doing a simulation if the subjects have to
<br>
consent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the instant any element of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation attains consciousness and citizenship, ve cannot be coerced.
</em><br>
<p>[I find this ve/ver/vim/vis stuff silly. What's wrong with it/its?]
<br>
<p>How do you detect consciousness?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ve cannot be forced to remain in your simulation or even to ever speak to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you again.
</em><br>
<p>What's the alternative to remaining in the simulation? Being deleted? Being
<br>
pinocchioed? What if we lack the technology to pinocchio a sim?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your situation, and vis, are in that instant made precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symmetrical; you can no more command ver than ve might command you.
</em><br>
<p>Pause the simulation, tweak some variables, resume the simulation. The sim's
<br>
behavior changes by the controllers command.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The act of creation gives no moral right whatsoever to command or coerce. 
</em><br>
<p>You sure do make a lot of commandments. Are you running this reality?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is simply a historical fact about the causal origins of a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent entity.  Creators are not entirely powerless; they have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control over *what* is created; but once created, the creation is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen, and independent.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, so it's not a rule you're laying down, but a fact. So if you're wrong,
<br>
and simulated entities *can* be controlled, then you don't have a problem
<br>
with that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is the morality of it, those are the rights, in tomorrow's world as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this one; all that remains is the task of making it real.
</em><br>
<p>Not so fast, slick. Others need to see things your way first.
