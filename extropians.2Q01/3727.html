<p>I recall the exact question being asked. I don't remember hearing the
<br>
answer. Here's btw one illustration of the built-in assumption: that all
<br>
FPGA chips are identical, and that they all run under the same conditions.
<br>
<p>Varying the temperature during run and selecting the target die randomly
<br>
would have removed the bias. It should have been a part of the fitness

function in the experiment, but it was not. Of course, because it wasn't
<br>
we've learned something interesting, natch.

</em><br>
<p>Of course, this assumes we knew how to do things better. Unfortunately,
<br>
we're too stupid to make a clean design. It is probably some
<br>
Godelian-flavoured intrinsic system limitation. As I said, I'm looking
<br>
forward to tear into &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;. Hopefully, it's not too
<br>
overhyped.
