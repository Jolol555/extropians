<p>Well...I was going to wait until I'd actually done it to announce it,
<br>
but this is as good a cue as I'm going to get.  This past weekend, I
<br>
managed to collate together what appear to be the equations necessary
<br>
for a simple plasma engine.  I was going to toss them into a
<br>
spreadsheet when I got time (probably next weekend), but what if I
<br>
converted them to Javascript and posted them in an HTML letter to this
<br>
list instead, along with a brief description of the engine as a system?
<br>
Granted, I'm not 100% sure I got all the equations correct - but asking
<br>
for someone to double-check would be part of the point of posting it.
<br>
This would seem to satisfy both the &quot;open source&quot; (Javascript is a
<br>
specification that people can write interpreters for) and &quot;GUI&quot;
<br>
(equationss encoded into a form, so you just plug in numbers and click
<br>
a button to see the results; or if you want to edit the equations, save
<br>
to HTML and hack around with the code, then open the page again)
<br>
desires.
<br>
<p>Some of these equations would be specific to plasma engines (for
<br>
instance, the amount of power required to contain the plasma), but some
<br>
would apply to all RLVs (for instance, the rocket equation that
<br>
determines how much fuel mass you'll need).  We could take that as a
<br>
base, then add different sets for different propulsion technologies.
<br>
(I'd favor simple chemical rockets, and the versions of same that have
<br>
actually been deployed, as an early add-on for reference if nothing
<br>
else.)  Host a page with all the models on a site where someone with
<br>
the bandwidth to maintain this project can incorporate new models that
<br>
have been submitted (possibly two versions: one for all submitted ones,
<br>
and one for ones where one or two people who did not write it have
<br>
checked the code and failed to find any flaws - a simple implementation
<br>
of peer review, hopefully with the same benefits).
