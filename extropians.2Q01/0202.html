<p>We've all been through this too many times.  If you just ignore the debate,
<br>
it might -- ah, might! -- go away.  Just cool out.
<br>
<p>You also have to realize that when you go into rant mode in an open forum,
<br>
it's the equivalent of screaming like a madman in a restaurant.  You might
<br>
think you're directing your comments at a few people -- who you leave
<br>
nameless for the rest of us, so we can't judge -- but everyone reads them
<br>
here, including people who might not have read them before.  Including
<br>
people who might just think you're being an ass.  (I'm not saying you are,
<br>
then again I rarely read any of the posts with &quot;GUN&quot; in the subject line.  I
<br>
also rarely read anything from Ian...:)
<br>
<p>For the record, I'm against any limits on gun ownership, but really this
<br>
on/off debate does nothing to change society or people's minds.  You are for
<br>
such limits.  Your tantrum did not change my mind.  Nor do I believe a
<br>
similar tantrum by someone on my side of the fence will change yours.  So,
<br>
what's the point?
<br>
<p>Peace!
