<p>M. Pour-El and I. Richards [Computability in Analysis and Physics, Springer,
<br>
Berlin, 1989] have proven that even though solutions of the &quot;wave equation&quot;
<br>
behave deterministically, there exist computable initial data (initial conditions)
<br>
with the weird property that for a later (computable) time the value of the &quot;field&quot;
<br>
is &quot;non-computable&quot; (non-computable evolution). Randomness in physics
<br>
correspond to mathematical uncomputability.
<br>
<p>N.C.A. da Costa and F.A. Doria [Undecidability and Incompleteness in Classical
<br>
Mechanics, International Journal Theoret. Physics, 30 - 1991, p. 1041] have proven
<br>
that the problem whether a given Hamiltonian can be integrated, by quadratures,
<br>
is &quot;undecidable&quot; (in the sense of the incompleteness theorem).
<br>
<p>Now the nature of God (type III) involves the problem of infinity, the problem of
<br>
undecidability (which has nothing to do with &quot;truth&quot;), and the problem of randomness.
<br>
<p>P. Davies [The Mind of God, Penguin, 1992] wrote that one day J.A. Wheeler
<br>
was the subject in the game of the &quot;20 Question&quot;. He started asking simple
<br>
questions, like &quot;Is it big?&quot; et cetera. Then he guessed &quot;Is it a cloud?&quot;. And the
<br>
answer was &quot;Yes!&quot; and came out in a burst of laughing. Backstage: no word
<br>
had been actually chosen, all the answers to his questions came out randomly,
<br>
just keeping consistent with previous answers and Wheeler's questions.
<br>
<p>This may be an &quot;alternative mathematics&quot;.

<p><p>J. L. Borges  [&quot;Argumentum Ornithologicum&quot;, 1952]
<br>
&quot;I close my eyes and see birds in flight. 
<br>
The vision lasts for a second or less; 
<br>
I do not know how many birds I have seen. 
<br>
Was it a definite or indefinite number? 
<br>
This problem is also a question about the existence of God. 
<br>
If God exists, the number is definite because God knows how many birds I saw. 
<br>
If God does not exist, the number is indefinite because nobody was able to count the birds. 
<br>
In that case (let us assume) I saw less than ten birds and more than just one, 
<br>
but I did not see nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three or two birds. 
<br>
I saw a number between one and ten that is neither nine nor eight, nor seven, nor six, nor five etc. 
<br>
We cannot imagine this total number; therefore, God exists.&quot; 
<br>
<p>[Unfortunately those &quot;uncountable&quot;numbers actually do exist, 
<br>
Thoralf Skolem called them the &quot;non standard numbers&quot;, in 1934]
