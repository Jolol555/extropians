<p>Thank you for the comment, Mitch.  I see that Hal has already addressed
<br>
much of your post, but I would like to add a few things here.  First,
<br>
you need to tell us more about what you are calling &quot;mind&quot; so we have
<br>
some way of generating falsifiable predictions about it.  You also talk
<br>
about &quot;thoughts&quot; without a bright line test that would say what kind of
<br>
behavior is thought vs something like reflex.  Also, where on the
<br>
evolutional continuum is the bright line where creatures got minds and
<br>
started having thoughts?  When in your own personal development from a
<br>
single cell did you get a &quot;mind&quot; and have &quot;thoughts&quot;?
<br>
<p>One very hard thing for me to buy in the Quantum Mind speculation is
<br>
that somehow the quantum coherence involved is not impacted by the
<br>
strong magnetic fields used to image living chemistry in an MRI
<br>
equipment.  Small frogs have been magnetically levitated by very high
<br>
fields (<a href="http://www.sci.kun.nl/hfml/froglev.html">http://www.sci.kun.nl/hfml/froglev.html</a>) without loss of neural
<br>
activity.  Humans have remained conscious through exposure to lethal
<br>
levels of ionizing radiation that interacts directly to introduce
<br>
disorder on the quantum level.  However, micrograms of LSD can
<br>
restructure your consciousness through straightforward chemical paths.
<br>
<p>Brain imaging technology now lets us watch neural activity as people
<br>
process information.  Your &quot;mind&quot; may look like one unfathomable whole
<br>
from the inside, but people's brain activity looks more and more
<br>
mechanistic when view by researchers from the outside.  We know that a
<br>
specific brain structure is responsible for generating the &quot;self.&quot;  If
<br>
this is damaged, you may still be able to answer questions on an IQ
<br>
test, but 'you' are gone.
<br>
<p>As for the limitations of computer science re explaining thinking,
<br>
please remember that throughout history science could not explain
<br>
things, until it could.  Consider how much the last 50 years of genetics
<br>
have explained.  We are just getting to the point of being able to
<br>
understand how flat worms work.  Do you expect we are going to go
<br>
marching up the chain of phylogeny and suddenly hit a snag because the
<br>
models do not include quantum computing?
<br>
<p>If you have more information that fills in some of these gaps, please
<br>
let me know.
