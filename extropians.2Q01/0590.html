<em>&gt;From: &quot;Greg Burch&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20SOC:%20The%20Challenge%20of%20&quot;The%20Second%20World&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;200103150111.f2F1B3L25729@pheidippides.md.chalmers.se&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[...]  As an example, I have seen many instances of what Europeans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and “Anglospherians” would call “corruption” at every level of second world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;societies, especially in the realm of private business, that usually isn’t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;addressed by institutional reformers.
</em><br>
<p>In Argentina, it's almost impossible to influence corruption on the private
<br>
sector, due to the state control agencies having been emptied of all powers
<br>
by the corrupt ruling elites and monopolistic businessmen. As an example of
<br>
this, right now there is quite a ruckus due to how all top authorities in our
<br>
Central Bank (state owned, and keeper of monetary reserves) have been exposed
<br>
as having engaged in HUGE amounts of money laundry after co-opting many
<br>
of the local capitalists and businessmen. Even IBM is involved...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course, the higher stress placed on personal relationships in the societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in question can ultimately be seen as so fundamental to their character
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that making this kind of change might be seen as a kind of “cultural suicide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If so, it may be a question of choosing the manner that those cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be extinguished.
</em><br>
<p>IMHO, another nasty factor is that you should expect a LOT of violence as a
<br>
result of the change attempts. Unions on strike in my country are well-known
<br>
for how easy they engage in violent activity, in part to answer the usually
<br>
uncalled VERY violent repression of strikes and protests from our security
<br>
forces. Our security forces are deeply stuck into fascist, corporativist ideas.
<br>
Many of the commanding officers have dark pasts in the &quot;dirty war&quot; during the
<br>
last military dictatorship, and any attempt to bring them to justice for their
<br>
atrocities is met with violence. As people see these corrupt genocides
<br>
are not only free, but prospering and even in the blessing of businessmen
<br>
and politicians, any law enforcement credibility just vanishes. For us,
<br>
the extinguishing the bad culture may very well plunge what remains of
<br>
societal relations into another version of Colombia or one of the many
<br>
African hell places. Even if you succeed, expecting to do it without the loss
<br>
of many lives due to institutional and inorganic violence is utterly naive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In this regard, I have often noted that one can look at the superficial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;institutions in the societies in question and see a complete and elaborate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legal system – ON PAPER.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. That is pretty much the whole extent of our judicial system. Most of
<br>
the judge positions are vacant, courts ridiculously understaffed, and
<br>
material facilities for processing the trials and their immense paperwork
<br>
have simply collapsed. The government is unable to fund the judicial system
<br>
at all. It is nowadays VERY rare for a trial to get solved
<br>
at all, or for evidence and proper process to being handled beyond the most
<br>
basic ways. On top of it, much of our judiciary is as corrupt as the rest
<br>
of the picture, and anyone expecting a just treatment when faced with an
<br>
issue within the elites' private garden is utterly naive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was a real heartbreak to hear his words, because they cast a bright
</em><br>
<em>&gt;light on the fact that there is no really new thinking going on.
</em><br>
<p>Admittedly, intelectuals in Latin America are still much stuck into the
<br>
old &quot;third world revolutionary discourse&quot; ways. Blaming them in exclusive for
<br>
this is unfair, though. A big reason they see this kind of discourse as
<br>
still valid is how the hardcore sectors of the ruling elites still resort
<br>
to the opposite discourse of thinly-veiled aristocratic/fascist, deeply 
<br>
conservative-catholical, right-wing, antinational nonsense. Heck, people
<br>
have elected well-known genocides as governors or congressmen, lured by this
<br>
kind of reactionary discourse. One can only imagine how that must have looked
<br>
as a confirmation of the validity of revolutionary discourse for the 
<br>
intellectuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[...]  One thing that won’t
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work is simple, “top-down” institutional reform.  Instead, what is required
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a broad-based and deep impetus to honest self-assessment.  How this can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be fostered is the real challenge.
</em><br>
<p>I think as long as our educational system keeps working in such a ruinous way
<br>
as of now (only 1 in 5 young people finish high-school these days), the current
<br>
social consensus and generalized ignorance will keep the stagnation going on.
<br>
Skilled individuals need to assume a personal compromise with salvaging
<br>
education, as no governmental or private sector attempts to change things
<br>
should be expected. As I said, I plan to compromise myself in such a way. I'm
<br>
worried however I seem to be pretty much the exception, judging by how most of 
<br>
the people in academics I keep in touch with in Argentina, keep telling me they 
<br>
are moving abroad or can't wait to move abroad at the first chance they might
<br>
have to do so. Is the whole thing hopeless and are the likes of me naive fools?
