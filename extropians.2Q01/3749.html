<p>
The part about Robin's paper (<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a>) that
<br>
I have a hardest time understanding is the discussion of common priors.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure which of the following arguments is being made, if any:
<br>
<p>Argument A:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If people have common priors, then upon discussion they will come to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;agreement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People don't come to agreement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore people don't have common priors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For people not to have common priors means that they do not seek
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the truth [1].
<br>
<p>Argument B:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If people have common priors, *and use Bayesian reasoning in trying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to seek the truth*, then upon discussion they will come to agreement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People do have common priors [2].
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But people don't come to agreement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore they don't use Bayesian reasoning in trying to seek the truth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if they really wanted to seek the truth, they would use Bayesian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoning, or at least try to approximate it, and the conclusion would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;still hold.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore people don't want to seek the truth.
<br>
<p>Argument C:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If people have common priors, then upon discussion they will come to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;agreement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People do have common priors [2].
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore people will come to agreement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But people claim not to come to agreement, and believe that they don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;come to agreement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore people are lying about this to themselves and others.
<br>
<p><p>[1] &quot;We are claiming that in the real world, these non-common priors
<br>
are best understood as non-truth-seeking.&quot;
<br>
<p>[2] &quot;And if the process of conception produces an acceptable causal
<br>
ancestry relation, then the fact that all humans share a common
<br>
evolutionary ancestor makes all humans relevant relatives. So why should
<br>
not all humans, including John and Mary, share a common prior?&quot;
<br>
<p><p>It's not clear to me whether the question of whether two humans share
<br>
a common prior is an empirical one, or a matter of definitions and
<br>
methodology.  Is it a matter of fact whether you and I share common
<br>
priors?  Or is it a question of which assumptions are most useful to
<br>
analyze our interactions?  (Or something else?)
<br>
<p>I also don't understand the claim [1] above relating non-common priors
<br>
to lack of truth seeking, unless it is a short-hand for argument B.
<br>
