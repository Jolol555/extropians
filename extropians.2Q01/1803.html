<p>I was approached two times recently. First by a journalist writing about
<br>
the Rael cult and seemed to think that they are transhumanists. The second
<br>
approach was by a Swedish journalist asking for references of transhumans
<br>
in Sweden. 
<br>
<p>Rather than blindly giving out names of extropians or other transhumanists,
<br>
as a practice I try to do some due diligence on the person/group contacting
<br>
me.  This second contact, again, had a Raelina undertone.

</em><br>
<p>We are visible, and becoming more visible yearly.
<br>
<p>Raelians have recently received press because of their interests in
<br>
cloning, etc.  Being a religious organization (a cult) makes them appear to
<br>
be more of an organization than a group of individuals who share
<br>
philosophical and ideological views.
<br>
<p>By the way, if extropians are not visible in Sweden, then let's find out
<br>
why.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Can we afford that they are visible?&lt;
</em><br>
<p>We certainly can afford to be cautious.  We can also afford to continue
<br>
responsibly discussing extropian/transhumanist ideas and providing reliable
<br>
information to the public.  This is our best defense - actively providing
<br>
reasonable, reliable information.
