<em>&gt; T.0. Morrow promoted a nice interesting philosophy (quasi-religion)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, his discussions sith Samantha placed side by side with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezers Sysop discussions do raise some interesting issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we assume that extropian principles are those striving for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing complexity and sophistication (this may be vulnerable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to attack, but lets assume it for a minute) -- and *if* we assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that conscious entities are inherently valuable and you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infringe on their right to self-determine whether or not they should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to exist do we not have an inherent conflict?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I.e. if you exhaust all the possibilities (read use up all the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to store the memory states of the all the conscious entities that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever been created and who cannot be destroyed) -- does not the moral position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you &quot;cannot&quot; erase those states imply that you cannot fullfill the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian prime directive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would not think so.  There is considerable overlap of material among
<br>
human mentalities.  I would rather doubt that all the memories and
<br>
fundamental personality structures take up all that much space.  After
<br>
all that don't take up that much space coded very inefficiently and
<br>
redundantly in meat-brains.  So I would be very surprised if you ran out
<br>
of computational space in such a manner as described.  Also, there is
<br>
nothing in the implied moral position that says that all beings must be
<br>
running at every nanosecond. From the point of view of the beings there
<br>
would be no difference as long as their milieu did not change out from
<br>
too rapidly to cope with at all.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The fundamental path through which evolution operates is to wipe the slate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently clean from time to time to allow it to go off in a completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different direction.  This is not allowed in a &quot;moral&quot; SysOp world interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in protecting everyone's &quot;self&quot;-interests.  (I doubt the SysOp has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-destruct sequence tied to on a random interval timers).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>AFAIK, evolution does not really wipe the slate clean and go in a
<br>
different direction.  It most builds on what is already present. 
<br>
Besides, evolution, is not some super-morality or model for all that can
<br>
or should be forever more.  I do wonder just how the definition of a
<br>
&quot;self&quot; that has interests that should be catered to is to be arrived at. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Now, from an extropian perspective, you desire that the phase space be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explored as completely as is feasible.  Accepting that, you realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sooner or later your sim will have had its run and your bits are up for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reuse.  From a truly extropic perspective this is fine with you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I could care less if phase space is explored as completely as possible
<br>
as long as the beings present can continue to grow and learn as much as
<br>
possible.   If that takes exploring phase space completely then so be
<br>
it, but the goals/desires and wellbeing of the beings involved is first
<br>
priority not to be sacrified for some other goal imho. I do not see why
<br>
all bits need to be reused for something else to the degree that any
<br>
being need be wiped so your dilemna is lost on me.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Put another way, I think that Eliezer and Greg have a problem adhering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to extropic principles unless there is some very magic hand-waving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done on why &quot;extropians&quot; or &quot;SysOps&quot; would choose to limint the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phase space that can feasibly be explored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I find this a curious projection actually of our current scarcity
<br>
thinking on to what is not in any reasonable timeframe likely to be
<br>
scarce.  It seems like a projection of the need for death and recycling
<br>
on a totally different context and a claim that this is required to
<br>
actually support extropian principles no less!  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In short -- what do you do in the simulation where you get to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you cannot explore any further without 'offing' someone against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their will?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You do not explore further.  But I think this is a strawman that in
<br>
practice is highly unlikely.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [Now there may be parts of the Extropian Principles that deal with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I haven't checked them), but it would seem to me that the consequence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this is that what we are really discussing is &quot;Limited Extropianism&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not a consciously driven (read probably more efficient) full-blown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism where you fully explore the phase space.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What makes fully exploring the phase space a wonderful goal, extropian
<br>
or otherwise, if you limit involuntarily (murder) some extropians in the
<br>
process of chasing after this goal?  Goals can only be reasonable in the
<br>
context of what they are for.  You lose that context when you speak of
<br>
offing people imo.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Note, there may be a form of &quot;moral&quot; extropianism where you explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the phase space as fully as possible, but you do it with as little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pain &amp; suffering&quot; as possible.   This gets extraordinarily tricky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as for example would be the case where one want to determine whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain &amp; suffering can drive people to self-enlightenment such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they realize pain is something that &quot;they&quot; have and can choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to experience in a variety of ways.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt we are wise enough to decide exactly what our wellbeing and best
<br>
goals are and especially that we are wise enough to decide what they are
<br>
for others.  In light of that I find it morally objectionable to talk of
<br>
offing one another to supposedly better pursue the goals we all agree
<br>
to.  I don't agree to any such goals at that price.
