<p>
I can't speak for other quantum-mind theorists when
<br>
it comes to specifics. But this is my model.
<br>
<p>1. The world consists of interacting 'quantum monads'
<br>
which are like the substances of classical metaphysics
<br>
in being enduring units, but possessing states whose
<br>
complexity (number of degrees of freedom, descriptive
<br>
bit complexity) is variable. What we call 'two entangled
<br>
particles' is actually a single quantum monad with
<br>
twice as many degrees of freedom as a single particle.
<br>
<p>2. The individual self is a single quantum monad
<br>
in a very complex state. A momentary state of
<br>
consciousness is a momentary state of the monad that
<br>
is you. Physically this seems to require macroscopic
<br>
quantum states in the brain which are relevant to
<br>
cognition, so this is a hypothesis with empirical
<br>
consequences.
<br>
<p>3. The ontology of current natural science (space,
<br>
time, quantity, causality, and not much else) is
<br>
incomplete. Current fundamental theories make use of
<br>
some but not all of the ontological variety already
<br>
apparent to us in experience, and philosophy of mind
<br>
then attempts to reduce the remaining variety
<br>
(qualia, intentionality, simultaneity) to some
<br>
combination of the naturalistic categories.
<br>
Instead, physical theory needs to be reformulated so
<br>
it has the necessary ontological diversity built in.
<br>
<p>4. Only a quantum monad can 'have a self', think,
<br>
be aware. Classical computers consist of large numbers
<br>
of quantum monads marshalled in predictable ways,
<br>
and can formally imitate the state dynamics of a monad,
<br>
but cannot experience or think. In particular, the
<br>
representational content of computational states is
<br>
just like the semantic content of words on a page -
<br>
a matter of convention and interpretation - whereas
<br>
the natural intentional states of monads have intrinsic
<br>
intentionality.
<br>
<p>5. On the other hand, a quantum computer at least
<br>
has the potential for mentality, because (by hypothesis)
<br>
quantum-coherent systems are actually monads. But the
<br>
actual content of a quantum computer's experience would
<br>
not need to be the content of the computations we have
<br>
it perform - there would only need to be an isomorphism
<br>
between them.
<br>
<p>I already said some of this in a talk at
<br>
<a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mjporter/tucson/01.html">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mjporter/tucson/01.html</a>
<br>
(click on the transparencies to proceed through them).
<br>
<p>Having said that, I can now make some responses.
<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel said he thinks that
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2) The ~mind~ is a nonphysical entity -- a pattern of organization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patterns -- and is not intrinsically tied to any particular set of physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laws
</em><br>
<p>As I've just said, I believe implementation matters, and
<br>
that 'pattern' is still too formal a notion to be the
<br>
whole story - it doesn't have enough 'subjective ontology'
<br>
in it.
<br>
<p>James Rogers said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As a general question, what part of the mind would seem to require quantum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machinery?
</em><br>
<p>The unity of consciousness, which I propose to identify as
<br>
the experience from within of an ontological unity which
<br>
we detect from without as quantum entanglement.
<br>
<p>Let me say in passing that I don't deny that selves are
<br>
(in a sense) composite and variable, and that false beliefs
<br>
about personal constancy are certainly possible. It's just
<br>
that any first-person demonstrations that the self has parts
<br>
will remain within some ontology of the subjective - they
<br>
will break it down into drives or personalities or sensory
<br>
modalities... - nothing like elementary particles, which
<br>
result from reductionism applied in the third person; and
<br>
the phenomenon of entanglement shows that we even have
<br>
third-person evidence that the 'corpuscular' ontology is
<br>
not the full story.
<br>
<p>Anders Sandberg said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't see how quantum mechanical mechanisms would introduce anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ontologically new in a description of mind. Entanglement is very neat,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but such correlations could just as well be implemented in a contrived
</em><br>
<em>&gt;classical way, so why would quantum mechanics add any new here?
</em><br>
<p>Quantum mechanics in itself doesn't add the ontological
<br>
novelty I need, but it has room for it.
<br>
<p>Ken Clements said... a lot:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;you need to tell us more about what you are calling &quot;mind&quot; so we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some way of generating falsifiable predictions about it.  You also talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about &quot;thoughts&quot; without a bright line test that would say what kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior is thought vs something like reflex.  Also, where on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutional continuum is the bright line where creatures got minds and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;started having thoughts?  When in your own personal development from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;single cell did you get a &quot;mind&quot; and have &quot;thoughts&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>If intentionality is the defining feature of the mental,
<br>
and intentionality can only be a property of 'quantum unities',
<br>
then there's no first-principle *behavioral* criterion for the
<br>
presence of thought; what you need to know is whether the
<br>
alleged thinking system is in a quantum-coherent state.
<br>
One shouldn't adopt this criterion until one has reason to
<br>
believe that some quantum theory of mind is correct, of course.
<br>
<p>More to the point, ordinary empiricism is not much good for
<br>
formulating basic concepts of mind, because it already presupposes
<br>
that you're an observer having experiences. There seems to be
<br>
no alternative to introspection and philosophy at this point;
<br>
you just have to dive into the circle of phenomenology,
<br>
epistemology, and ontology, and hope you come back with something
<br>
comprehensible. In the longer run one would hope that a fully
<br>
fleshed out theory of mind would cast light on what was going
<br>
on in such investigations, in a way that would render them more
<br>
secure - but it's not at all easy. Looking for quantum coherence
<br>
in living matter seems comparatively straightforward.
<br>
<p>I'll decline to speculate on where the dividing line between
<br>
mindless and mindful might lie in evolutionary and individual
<br>
development, but certainly my whole program of taking mind
<br>
seriously implies that such transitions objectively occur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One very hard thing for me to buy in the Quantum Mind speculation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that somehow the quantum coherence involved is not impacted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strong magnetic fields used to image living chemistry in an MRI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equipment.  Small frogs have been magnetically levitated by very high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fields (<a href="http://www.sci.kun.nl/hfml/froglev.html">http://www.sci.kun.nl/hfml/froglev.html</a>) without loss of neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activity.  Humans have remained conscious through exposure to lethal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;levels of ionizing radiation that interacts directly to introduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disorder on the quantum level.  However, micrograms of LSD can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restructure your consciousness through straightforward chemical paths.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good point. But have psychologists studied people
<br>
undergoing MRI? And it's not just a matter of MRI destroying
<br>
quantum coherence; MRI can *induce* transient quantum coherence.
<br>
So if these quantum brain states are there, the first question
<br>
is whether they're affected by MRI, the second question is
<br>
whether they're affected enough for the changes to be behaviorally,
<br>
instrumentally, or phenomenologically detectable.
<br>
<p>As for LSD - the quantum side of the brain, if it exists, is not
<br>
some wholly separate sphere. It's going to consist of bose-condensed
<br>
phonons in protein microfilaments, or entangled electrons in
<br>
microtubules, or some similarly concrete thing that's quite
<br>
accessible to influence by the introduction of a nanomole of LSD
<br>
molecules. And there's no straightforward chemical path leading
<br>
from 'LSD' to 'new structure of consciousness' because there's
<br>
no existing chemical description of the latter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Brain imaging technology now lets us watch neural activity as people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process information.  Your &quot;mind&quot; may look like one unfathomable whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the inside, but people's brain activity looks more and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanistic when view by researchers from the outside.  We know that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific brain structure is responsible for generating the &quot;self.&quot;  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this is damaged, you may still be able to answer questions on an IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;test, but 'you' are gone.
</em><br>
<p>What brain structure is that? What is *demonstrably* gone in
<br>
these 'selfless' people - self-knowledge, self-preservation?
<br>
To be a self, in the sense of being a locus of experience,
<br>
does not logically require either of these.
<br>
<p>On my view, the conscious brain is not a homogeneous quantum glob.
<br>
It's more like a hive of classical neural coprocessors which
<br>
interface between a distributed quantum entity and its environment.
<br>
But we may already have observed the quantum brain in action.
<br>
Quantum correlations, amplified by classical processes, might be
<br>
responsible for some already-known forms of synchronized neural
<br>
activity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for the limitations of computer science re explaining thinking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;please remember that throughout history science could not explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things, until it could.  Consider how much the last 50 years of genetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have explained.  We are just getting to the point of being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand how flat worms work.  Do you expect we are going to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;marching up the chain of phylogeny and suddenly hit a snag because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;models do not include quantum computing?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I already expressed my skepticism about the ability of
<br>
*computer* science to be a foundation for the science of mind...
<br>
How would you answer the three problems for a computational
<br>
theory of intentionality which I listed in my original message?
<br>
And if we are only just getting to the point of understanding
<br>
how flatworms work, there's still time for quantum phenomena to
<br>
show up even there.
