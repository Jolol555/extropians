From: Chuck Kuecker &lt;<a href="mailto:ckuecker@mcs.net?Subject=Re:%20Made%20in%20China&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104171900.MAA09884@well.com&gt;">ckuecker@mcs.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;You find exploited child labor acceptable?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;If the alternative is no labor, and starvation, yes. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries run at a very different level of &quot;comfort&quot; than we do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and what would be privation to us may well be a comfortable level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of life to others.
</em><br>
<p>These children have little choice, accepted fact.
<br>
<p>However we as much better-to-do Americans do have a choice, an
<br>
ethical and moral one, and that is whether or not to purchase goods
<br>
produced in sweatshops by child labor.
<br>
<p>The answer is clearly not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The definition of &quot;exploit&quot; can be used either to describe &quot;use&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or &quot;abuse&quot;. The actual definition must be left to those actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under the conditions in question.
</em><br>
<p>I left the actual definition to the dictionary, I'm sure those we
<br>
are talking about would choose &quot;abuse&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sometimes, I wonder about getting a second job - say at 7-11,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where I would get a steady paycheck :)
</em><br>
<p>;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Again, the workers are free to rise up against the abuse. I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing wrong with concerned citizens of other nations providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;help in this. The rulers of those countries might see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differently...
</em><br>
<p>Heck, even in a country that was supposed to be ethical (us) that
<br>
didn't stop companies from hiring thugs like the pinkertons to
<br>
prevent this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Again, if the boycott would drive the businesses out, these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will then not even have subsistence. Is this a good trade-off?
</em><br>
<p>These people can be paid fair wages for the countries they live in
<br>
and a tidy profit can still be had.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The point is - actions against the bosses usually trickle down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the oppressed, with the bosses shedding most, if not all, of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unpleasant effects. The only actions that could affect these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sweatshop owners would be either enforced legislation in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country, or a successful labor action by the workers.
</em><br>
<p>Or a refusal of civilized countries to trade with them under these
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I mean INVESTING. Send over more work, and ensure that conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are right in the plants. This has been working with US firms in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mexico.
</em><br>
<p>My original point was that there are people in our own
<br>
neighborhoods, many of these people are not going to be trainable
<br>
as software writers, who need an honest job. Think globally,
<br>
produce locally.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Good for you, now make the connection, children who are forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;work in sweatshops or starve are slaves.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Slavery is slavery, regardless of the fancy name given it. Forced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;labor is slavery. What happens in these places if someone refuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to work - are they fired or shot? If they are fired, this implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they can quit, also...
</em><br>
<p>Actually they have been killed, although it's often by being
<br>
neglected to death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And if they need to shed blood in their own countries to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change, this is the price they pay for freedom. Revolutions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not neat and clean.
</em><br>
<p>So now children must die? Sorry, I don't need a set of Nike's that
<br>
badly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I do not advocate that we invade these places and &quot;force&quot; them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change - but how else will the job get done? The people there must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rise up and change their own lives.
</em><br>
<p>I pointed out a third alternative, we can refuse to trade in these
<br>
goods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Agreed. I still think, though, that &quot;child labor&quot; is another hot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;button, and that many jobs can be safely and ethically done by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;children&quot; that are outlawed in this country, jobs that can spell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the difference between adequate nutrition and death.
</em><br>
<p>I don't like the idea of young children being forced to work to
<br>
survive, but even if necessary, they can be treated well, and paid
<br>
a decent wage.
<br>
<p>This is currently not the case.
