</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the reason is the following.  Laughable optimism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterizes the possible developments that are easy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see coming.  So it was laughably optimistic, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe that flying cars were immanent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in the long term, developments that couldn't have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseen are the ones that dominate.  And that's why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long term prognostications are laughably pessimistic.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, then we better reevaluate what we think. After all, we
<br>
transhumanists seem to be optimistic about both near and far
<br>
developments. Hence we better be more cautious about the near future and
<br>
the speed various transforming technologies appear, while our wild far
<br>
future extrapolations might be too *mild*.
