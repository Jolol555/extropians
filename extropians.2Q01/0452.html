</em><br>
<p>Perhaps this is an example of the old “glass is half-empty/half-full” 
<br>
phenomenon.  Taking a historical view that reaches back just a couple of 
<br>
hundred years, a figure as high as 30% seems to me to represent a fairly 
<br>
significant advance over any pre-modern society of which I am aware.  I 
<br>
certainly don’t mean to be Panglossian about this question: We can and should 
<br>
do better.  Ultimately, the question is what price we are prepared to pay to 
<br>
increase social mobility.  I would suggest that the programs of the 
<br>
Romantic/Socialist movements of the past 200 years have made the deal too 
<br>
dear to values of individual autonomy and dignity that underlie a conception 
<br>
of civil society that is consonant with the values we share here.  On the 
<br>
other hand, I believe that working to make opportunity for individual 
<br>
achievement regardless of family economic background is perfectly consistent 
<br>
with those values.  Thus my original observation that many of us have come to 
<br>
realize that “diversity” is actually a profit-maximizing institutional 
<br>
value, when it is not used as a banner under which to corrode standards of 
<br>
performance.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;.. ) is not at odd with your estimate of 50% - assuming that
<br>
<em>&gt;there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;larger numbers 'down below' means that a small percentage coming from there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a large impact on the upper echelon.
</em><br>
<p>That’s true as a matter of the simple numbers, as you point out, which is one 
<br>
factor that gives me hope for continuing progress toward increased social 
<br>
mobility that does not undermine important notions of individual autonomy.  
<br>
Once you begin to break down “irrational” barriers to upward social 
<br>
mobility, one can look forward to a cascading effect as more and more 
<br>
talented people move upward into positions of wealth and power.  An important 
<br>
question is whether there are social-structural means available for those who 
<br>
profit from such openness in the early stages to “pull up the ladder”, which 
<br>
has been the case in all previous historical periods in which social mobility 
<br>
has occurred.  Institutions focusing on basic individual autonomy and dignity 
<br>
OUGHT to tend to combat this natural tendency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As it turns out, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the legal profession in the US, the competition for talent is so intense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the economic or educational background of a candidate's parents per se
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; irrelevant to hiring and promotion decisions.  The &quot;great filter&quot; is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; candidate's own academic performance and personality.  Because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hunger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for diversity in large firms like mine (something we've developed because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we've come to realize that diversity is an element of creativity in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;firm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; culture&quot;, which is an economic value that goes straight to our bottom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;line),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; qualified candidates from traditionally &quot;disadvantaged&quot; backgrounds end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; having somewhat greater opportunities than those who come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;professional&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; family backgrounds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I seriously doubt, though, whether these advantages will outweigh the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disadvantages that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poorer children have.  I don't think anybody here will dispute the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correlation between your parents' income and your income than there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between iq and your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;income.
</em><br>
<p>I do agree with your observation.  The hard questions come when we ask what 
<br>
we should do in response to this realization.  A fair and just society ought 
<br>
to react to this truth by working to lower the cost of education and 
<br>
increasing the over-all cultural value placed on education and meaningful 
<br>
achievement.  We can certainly see the impact that such social values have in 
<br>
the community of Asian immigrants in the US, who have a very high degree of 
<br>
inter-generational social mobility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I think it would be nice to develop ways for folks to be able to both do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; make more money.  The recent trend toward creating university

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmmmm - I haven't heard about this. I'm assuming this is a recent American

</em><br>
<p>It is a relatively recent development here, but has gained significant 
<br>
momentum in the last 10 years.  Basically every major university now has one 
<br>
or more of such vehicles.  Here’s an article critical of this development 
<br>
(although it focuses mainly on other aspects of commercialization of 
<br>
university research):
<br>

<br>
<p>I had trouble finding general information in a quick search because of the 
<br>
lack of general terms addressing the phenomenon.  Some universities have a 
<br>
single “privatization and research entrepreneurship” arm that reaches across 
<br>
departmental lines, while others have undertaken this sort of thing on a 
<br>
group-by-group basis.  I would suggest looking into the areas you’re 
<br>
interested in and talking with US researchers in that field to get a feel for 
<br>
how it works.
