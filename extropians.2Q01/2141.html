Jim Fehlinger &lt;<a href="mailto:fehlinger@home.com?Subject=Re:%20the%20pool%20we're%20trying%20to%20paddle%20in&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104091553.JAA04165@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">fehlinger@home.com</a>&gt; quoted Niles Eldredge:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;There are... many people who believe literally that the notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological evolution is the work of the devil...  I have spent over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twenty years talking with, debating, and reading the literature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creationists...  I remain convinced that their unrelenting hatred of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very idea of evolution stems from their concept of morality:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where morals come from, and why people behave in a moral fashion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (when they do).  The argument is simple: the Bible says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'mankind' was created in God's image.  If that is not true, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead we are descended from the apes, then there is no reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever to expect humans to behave in a godlike, moral fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We would, instead, be expected to behave like 'animals.'  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conviction is deeply held.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't figure out how creationists can make this kind of an
<br>
argument.  It is so completely twisted and backwards.  The average
<br>
human is clearly not perfectly moral, not to mention some extremely
<br>
below average humans.  If such immoral beings truly were created &quot;in
<br>
the image of&quot; som all powerful God, or by such a God, then we are all
<br>
truly screwed and there is no hope for us forever.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, if we evolved from lower life forms, yet so many of us
<br>
are still able to achieve the high level of morality they do, that is
<br>
the most fantastic thing of all.  In this case we really do have a
<br>
hope and prayer of growing and continuing to become more moral and
<br>
better people.

<p>&quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20the%20pool%20we're%20trying%20to%20paddle%20in&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104091553.JAA04165@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt; posted this quote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot; ...is God unable to prevent suffering and thus not omnipotent? or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is he able but not willing to prevent it and thus not merciful?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Walter Kaufmann
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the plain and simple truth which even a child can
<br>
grasp (until his mind is corrupted in Sunday School.)  I hope that
<br>
long before there is anything close to an all powerful God, evils like
<br>
isolation, death, suffering... will have long since been overcome.  As
<br>
long as there is evil, no such great God exists by definition.  The
<br>
theists that claims to have &quot;faith and hope&quot; is a liar because to
<br>
accept that there is already such a God, yet still evil, is not faith
<br>
and hope, but the ultimate in giving up in despair.  The atheist is
<br>
the only person that can honestly have true and faith and hope.
