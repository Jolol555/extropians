</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question becomes &quot;What is the investment required to displace

</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at them and will gradually come to accept the premises

</em><br>
<em>&gt; has is very large compared to our I/O bandwidth.  Thus most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the reasoning remains behind the Wizard's curtain.  At
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is simply incorrect and may be so fundamentally wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that just simply will not 'get' it UNLESS YOU YELL AT THEM.
</em><br>
<p>Has it been your experience that yelling at someone who doesn't get
<br>
it is actually productive?  It sure hasn't been true in mine.
<br>
Yell at most people and they will close their minds tight and bring
<br>
the fight/flight systems online.  Do you yell at a child learning to
<br>
walk?  No?  Then why yell at an adult learning to rethink fundamental
<br>
assumptions?  Which of us has so mastered all of what is germane to
<br>
Singularity and all that is likely to come and all the implications
<br>
of the changes along the way?  All of us are likely at some point
<br>
to be simply wrong.  I do not believe yelling at one another will
<br>
help that one bit.   It would help a lot more to assume each of us
<br>
is genuinely involved, interested, intelligent and reasonable than
<br>
to assume the opposite and start yelling at what you view as the dumb
<br>
asses. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, most individuals simply accept whatever memes they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are given, without ever asking &quot;Why do I 'believe' what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belive?&quot; or &quot;What if I am wrong?&quot;.  Those individuals have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a huge investment in holding onto those memes because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) If you are speaking to them, those memes have 'worked'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to date (i.e. they are alive); (b) You cannot give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them the 'experience' that your memes could work better;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (c) They are usually surrounded by individuals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the most part 'agree' with their memes and so to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discard them could place them in an outcast position with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard to their social network.  The costs of radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind shifts are very high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Clearly you aren't speaking of Kurzweil, Smalley, Vogel and others
<br>
you disagree with and think should be yelled at here.  
<br>
<p>People truly like the above clearly cannot be reached nor
<br>
made more able to do the necessary self-examination and critical
<br>
thinking by any amount of yelling.
