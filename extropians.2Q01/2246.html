<p><p><p><p><p><p>Silicon Valley Reacts to Economy With a New Approach
<br>
<p><p>By JOHN MARKOFF
<br>
<p><p><p>Dan Krauss for The New York Times
<br>
Walt Morton, center, of Sawhorse Partners, who spends his days hunting
<br>
for
<br>
deals on computer hardware, said that the entrepreneurial spirit of the
<br>
dot-com industry was still alive in San Francisco.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>SAN FRANCISCO, April 11 - Among the junkyards, crushed cars and broken
<br>
glass in this city's warehouse district, Walt Morton spends his days
<br>
hunting for deals on computer hardware from failed dot-com companies.
<br>
<p>The auctioning off of the infrastructure of the not-so-new economy is
<br>
one
<br>
sign that Silicon Valley is plunging into a financial abyss unparalleled
<br>
for decades in this high-technology region.
<br>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Morton and others like him are evidence that the
<br>
entrepreneurial fervor that led to the boom is still very much alive,
<br>
and
<br>
that sprouts seem to be emerging from the rubble.
<br>
<p>As he examined a pizza-box-size server computer and an auctioneer barked
<br>
out prices, Mr. Morton reflected that he might well be the first sign of
<br>
a
<br>
new era rather than an observer of the final moments of the old one.
<br>
<p>&quot;All the people I know who lost their jobs are trying to start new
<br>
companies,&quot; he said. But he added that their approach this time was
<br>
radically different from the gold-rush mentality of the quickly fading
<br>
dot-com era: &quot;We're part of a whole new wave of cheap start-ups.&quot;
<br>
<p>A former executive at America Online who is now chief executive of an
<br>
Internet start-up in San Francisco, Sawhorse Partners, Mr. Morton
<br>
explores
<br>
several auctions each week.
<br>
<p>&quot;If these are cheap, enough I might buy a couple of them,&quot; he said,
<br>
eyeing
<br>
a stack of computers sitting in a corner of a warehouse. He estimated
<br>
that
<br>
the infrastructure he built for his last start- up at a cost of $200,000
<br>
would now be less than $18,000.
<br>
<p>The shift in the market has created an unfamiliar paralysis among
<br>
Silicon
<br>
Valley's venture capitalists, many of whom have a dazed look as they
<br>
watch
<br>
previous bad investments crumble and try to figure out what the next hot
<br>
investment will be. As a result, the area's
<br>
venture-capital-to-entrepreneur
<br>
ecosystem has abruptly stalled, at least temporarily.
<br>
<p>While some analysts have worried about the impact that such dot-com fire
<br>
sales are having on equipment makers like Cisco, Dell and Sun
<br>
Microsystems,
<br>
the most visible beneficiaries of the boom, many economists noted that
<br>
the
<br>
recycling of equipment has always been a part of the high-technology
<br>
life
<br>
cycle, in which most start-up companies either fail or are acquired.
<br>
Employment, at this point, remains surprisingly strong.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think the whole dot-com layoff thing has been blown out of
<br>
perspective,&quot;
<br>
said Steven Levy, an economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of
<br>
the California Economy, in Palo Alto, noting that in the last three
<br>
months,
<br>
the San Francisco Bay area has recorded historically low unemployment
<br>
rates.
<br>
<p>The California Employment Development Department reported this month
<br>
that
<br>
the state's unemployment rate dropped to 4.5 percent in February, a
<br>
32-year
<br>
low. (It was 4.4 percent in December 1969.) The unemployment rate last
<br>
month in Santa Clara County, which largely defines Silicon Valley, was
<br>
1.7
<br>
percent, indicating that only 17,600 people were jobless in a work force
<br>
of
<br>
1,004,900.
<br>
<p>Even in San Francisco, which has been more dependent on e-commerce
<br>
start-ups, unemployment was 3.2 percent, up from 2.6 last year.
<br>
<p>Mr. Morton is one sign that while the dot-com bubble has burst and
<br>
expectations have been &quot;reset&quot; - in the current jargon of the e-commerce
<br>
neighborhood known as South of Market Street - the start-up culture here
<br>
is
<br>
now deeply ingrained.
<br>
<p>Big Storage, a South-of-Market start-up with 30 employees that largely
<br>
missed the dot-com boom, turned profitable in March, two months ahead of
<br>
schedule. The company, which sells Linux-based disk arrays to companies
<br>
that need large data storage systems, once felt embarrassed that it was
<br>
not
<br>
on the public offering bandwagon but was now finding it easier to
<br>
expand.
<br>
<p>&quot;Last year, each month I would apologize to my board of directors for
<br>
not
<br>
finding more business,&quot; said Big Storage's chief executive, Sam Bogach.
<br>
Now, he says, missing the boom was a blessing.
<br>
<p>Many Silicon Valley executives said the shift was away from the era of
<br>
easy-money dot-com start-ups and back to a climate that more closely
<br>
resembled the original Silicon Valley up-from-the-garage ethos.
<br>
<p>&quot;You're no longer viewed as a loser if you have a cheap office space;
<br>
you're perceived as smart,&quot; said Paul Kocher, chief executive of
<br>
Cryptography Research, who is financing a small start-up to develop an
<br>
e-commerce application.
<br>
<p>Indeed, it may be that venture capitalists, who until recently were
<br>
among
<br>
the biggest beneficiaries of the boom, are now the biggest victims of
<br>
the
<br>
downturn.
<br>
<p>&quot;The V.C.'s are hiding under their desks right now,&quot; said Anthony
<br>
Perkins,
<br>
co-author of &quot;The Internet Bubble,&quot; a 1999 book that predicted the
<br>
dot-com
<br>
shake-out.
<br>
<p>&quot;Most of them,&quot; Mr. Perkins said, &quot;are facing up to the fact of whatever
<br>
percentage of their deals that were stupid. They're shooting all the
<br>
lame
<br>
horses.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Perkins's company, Red Herring Communications, which publishes the
<br>
business and technology magazine Red Herring, had a round of layoffs not
<br>
long ago, but Mr. Perkins said that when he checked recently, he
<br>
discovered
<br>
that all but one of the former employees had found a job - and that the
<br>
one
<br>
person was not looking.
<br>
<p>Of 742 venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, he said, 192 were
<br>
created
<br>
within the last 18 months, a situation that will inevitably lead to a
<br>
pruning of the venture community in the months ahead. That, in turn,
<br>
will
<br>
lead to a consolidation in the power and influence of venture firms like
<br>
Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.
<br>
<p>And if the venture capital industry is in shock, that has created a
<br>
domino
<br>
effect among start-up companies.
<br>
<p>&quot;These guys are schizo right now,&quot; said David House, chief executive of
<br>
Allegro Networks, a start-up router company in San Jose, Calif. &quot;They've
<br>
just raised their billion- dollar funds and they're scared. Now everyone
<br>
wants to be the second guy to invest, not the first.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the point of view of the venture capitalists, the entrepreneurs have
</em><br>
also grown more cautious.
<br>
<p>&quot;We think it's a wonderful time to be a bold entrepreneur,&quot; said Jim
<br>
Breyer, managing partner of Accel Partners in Palo Alto, Calif. &quot;But
<br>
unfortunately we're not seeing a lot of people with those ideas. It's
<br>
too
<br>
bad.&quot;
<br>
<p>The current period, Mr. Breyer said, was similar to the one venture
<br>
capitalists went through in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when most
<br>
people thought Microsoft had won the PC platform wars and they were only
<br>
interested in incremental ideas.
<br>
<p>Today, most executives here remain convinced that the Internet is not a
<br>
fad
<br>
and that it has only begun to transform the economy. But they are now
<br>
grasping for specific trends, with profit potential, to seize upon.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are no fads right now,&quot; said Sheldon Breiner, a longtime Silicon
<br>
Valley inventor who is now an independent investor. &quot;Six months ago it
<br>
was
<br>
optical switching and a year ago it was business-to-business, but now I
<br>
don't know of a fad.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are those who said that the absence of fads was a good thing and
<br>
that
<br>
the economy in Silicon Valley was being led back to its fundamentals in
<br>
technology, where it has always excelled.
<br>
<p>&quot;Two years ago you couldn't recruit anyone into the semiconductor
<br>
industry,&quot; said Andrew Rappaport, a partner at August Capital, a venture
<br>
firm in Menlo Park, Calif. &quot;They all wanted to go to a dot-com. Now
<br>
they're
<br>
all coming back and the talent pool is growing.&quot;
<br>
<p>And some venture capitalists remain enthusiastic, certain that they are
<br>
only one company away from the Next Big Thing.
<br>
<p>&quot;We've gone from irrational exuberance to irrational pessimism,&quot; said
<br>
Greg
<br>
Galanos, a partner at Softbank Venture Capital in Mountain View, Calif.,
<br>
adding: &quot;Have I told you about Danger Research? Wait until you see what
<br>
they're doing!&quot;
