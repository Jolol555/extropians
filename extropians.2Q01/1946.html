<p>
To minimize off-topic posts, I will only post very brief updates in 
<br>
the future. Anyone who wants to be included in more extensive updates 
<br>
like this should email me off list.
<br>
Best wishes,
<br>
Jim Lewis (Gina's husband)
<br>
<p>I drove down to Sacramento last Friday, to Gina's Mom and Pop, and 
<br>
Saturday morning her Mom and I drove to Chowchila to visit Gina. We 
<br>
were quite fortunate in that Friday evening Gina had been moved out 
<br>
of the Reception Center (RC) into the general prison population (GP). 
<br>
So instead of a short visit with a glass wall and telephone between 
<br>
us, we were able to visit for several hours in a large room where 
<br>
prisoners and visitors can sit at a table together, or walk around a 
<br>
small enclosed (very enclosed) yard together. Sunday morning I drove 
<br>
down from Sacramento to Chowchilla again, and was able to visit with 
<br>
Gina a second time, from about 10 AM  to about 3 PM.
<br>
<p>A day or two before she had been moved to the GP, she met with the 
<br>
first of the two counselors that she meets with.  Gina got a perfect 
<br>
12.9 out of 12.9 on  her educational accomplishment test, which 
<br>
should help her get one of the better prison jobs. She also got a 
<br>
level I security classification, the lowest of the four levels. 
<br>
However, since VSPW is a maximum security prison, all of the women 
<br>
are mixed together in their 8-woman cells. Who goes where is 
<br>
determined by where there is a bed available, and most cells have one 
<br>
or more murderers with life sentences. So effectively everyone there 
<br>
is a level IV in terms of how they are treated, regardless of what 
<br>
their classification is.
<br>
<p>The advantage of the level I classification is that it opens the 
<br>
possibility of transfer to another institution. Her counselor 
<br>
recommended her for the Restitution Center. Her application is being 
<br>
evaluated by the Restitution Center and she should find out this week 
<br>
or next whether or not she has been accepted. The Restitution Center 
<br>
is technically not a prison -- it has no listing on the Department of 
<br>
Corrections web site. It is a minimum security installation in 
<br>
downtown Los Angeles run for the DoC by a contractor. Inmates are 
<br>
helped to find a job in the vicinity, where they work strictly 
<br>
regular hours (no working late) and then return to the Center 
<br>
immediately after work.
<br>
<p>So we are hoping that Gina is placed there, but it may not happen. 
<br>
The advantages would be well worth the longer drive per visit. If it 
<br>
does not happen, then she will be given a regular prison job at VSPW 
<br>
and will likely be there the rest of her sentence. We still don't 
<br>
know her parole date.
<br>
<p>Gina's new address:
<br>
<p>Gina Miller W88881
<br>
Housing Unit B3-29-01U
<br>
Valley State Prison for Women (VSPW)
<br>
PO Box 92
<br>
Chowchilla, CA 93610-0092
<br>
<p>Mail sent to the old address at A1-4-01L will be forwarded to the new 
<br>
address for a period of 30 days, although it takes several days 
<br>
longer for forwarded mail to reach GIna than for mail with the 
<br>
correct address. If she stays at VSPW, this address may remain 
<br>
constant; if she is accepted in the Restitution Center, it would 
<br>
change soon.
<br>
<p>The phone number at VSPW to verify inmate location is
<br>
559 665 6100 x6078
<br>
<p>The phone number for the mail room for information on what can be mailed is
<br>
559 665 6100 x5826
