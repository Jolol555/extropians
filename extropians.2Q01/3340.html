<em>&gt; My suggestion is that a MAJOR FOCUS of the transhumanist effort be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the assisting of the economically less fortunate, so that all of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity can move into the transhuman era together.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, I have an &quot;ulterior motive&quot; here in that I think this is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good thing to do in itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, I also think that nothing could be more effective in terms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associating transhumanism, in the public eye, with ~moral good~.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think it's a good idea to shift our focus closer to the present.
<br>
show how technology, when used wisely, can solve problems in the here 
<br>
and now. admittedly, i feel that buck for buck, siai or webmind are
<br>
probably better investments. but a small change in pr may have a
<br>
climactic impact on a broad range of transhumanist ventures that's
<br>
beyond my linear mind to foresee. in any case, the question is this:
<br>
organized religions have food drives to feed the hungry all the time,
<br>
what will we do differently?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a number of specific ideas along these lines, but I think I'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave it at that for the moment.  Except to suggest one thing: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ~Education~ would be a natural place to start.  Education in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner cities of the US and in the Third World.  What if there were a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanist Foundation, whose focus was on educating the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economically unfortunate in topics relevant BOTH to their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual advancement AND to their understanding of the transhuman 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future to come.  For example, science, philosophy, computer science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;education (or the lack thereof) is certainly a key issue. but how
<br>
many parents would want their child going to a school affiliated with 
<br>
some semi-myterious organization that they've never heard of? and
<br>
if we successfully innoculate the students against irrational
<br>
memes, will we face charges of brain-washing, a la scientology?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It costs about $14K to sponsor a school in Cambodia.  The Brazilian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government is sponsoring an initiative to create a $400 computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system -- a &quot;mini Net-connected Linux box for the masses.&quot;  If the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanist Foundation were involved in this sort of thing, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't be perceived as a bunch of freaks out to harvest other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples' organs for money so we can pay for having our ugly little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads frozen... we'd be perceived as the saviors of the world...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a sense, i guess foreign testbeds are simpler in that they have
<br>
less existing infrastructure that get in the way of change. we
<br>
could sponsor a school with less fear of being sued. we could equip a
<br>
village to become self-sufficient without too much capital up-front.
<br>
but from past discussions, i do recall the issue of corrupt local
<br>
thugs/warlords/governments, etc. i have no idea on whether and to
<br>
what extent this would be an obstacle though.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally, all this hinges on our ability to organize and raise
<br>
funds. of course, it is a lot more difficult to organize in the
<br>
absense of a concrete cause. so maybe we should draw up a list of
<br>
potential ventures first.
