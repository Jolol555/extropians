<em>&gt; You know, I sincerely hope that this compassionless guy who sees nothing wrong with foriegn sweatshops doesn't in any way represent what most extropians think.  Talk about reason without emotion, geez.  Some of us think that human beings have these things called rights, not just the ones in the first amendment, but also ones like liberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming that I am the 'compassionless guy' being referred to, I will
<br>
respond:
<br>
<p>Humans DO in fact have rights, which includes being free to choose who
<br>
and what you work for, under what standards you wish. Groups that want
<br>
to impose developed nation level labor and environmental standards on
<br>
undeveloped and developing nations are not just totally ignorant of
<br>
economics and technological development, they seek to confiscate the
<br>
right of the people of developed and developing nations to decide for
<br>
themselves what labor and environmental standards they wish to have in
<br>
their own sovereign nations. Talk about imperialistic hubris and
<br>
hegemonic arrogance.
<br>
<p>The Free Trade Area of the Americas treaty being negotiated right now
<br>
has a requirement that all paticipatory nations be democratic nations,
<br>
so that there is no chance of despotic governments exploiting the labor
<br>
of the citizenry.
<br>
<p>This whole argument is essentially a chicken/egg thing, where I am
<br>
saying you need development before enlightened labor standards can be
<br>
imposed. I work from a 'individuals and societies practice the morals
<br>
they can afford' standpoint. They may have high ideals and WANT higher
<br>
standards, but they must accept lower ones based on what their economy
<br>
can handle without choking off growth. In my opinion, those that oppose
<br>
this sort of rational viewpoint may indeed have the best interests of
<br>
those people in mind, but they are simply not thinking it through
<br>
completely, while I am sure there are others of a demagogic nature who
<br>
want to prevent people from becoming wealthy enough to not need a
<br>
socialist revolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I'm sure you think that's very backward and overly-romanticized of me to say that.  But I think people deserve to have a chance to do more than the same tedium over and over all thier lives, always at the mercy of thier employers if they say anything or disobey.  I mean, isn't that why the west abandoned serfdom and industrialized agriculture, so we *wouldn't* have to work our asses off all the time just to survive?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, the 'sweatshop' phenomenon exhibited itself hundreds of years
<br>
after the abandonment of serfdom, in the heart of our free market
<br>
industrial age. 
<br>
<p>If we did what you claim to 'so we wouldn't have to work our asses off',
<br>
then why is it that most families work more hours a week than they did
<br>
hundreds and thousands of years ago?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Grow a heart, for pete's sake.
</em><br>
<p>I've got one, thanks. I prefer to do my thinking with my head, that's
<br>
what it's for.
