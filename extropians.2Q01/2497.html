<p>A sweatshop involves much more than just being
<br>
underpaid.  Sweatshops typically feature several of
<br>
the following: threats and intimidation, human rights
<br>
abuses, hazardous working conditions, unsanitary
<br>
working conditions, failure to even pay the meager
<br>
wages that are owed, repression (often brutal) of
<br>
labor organization attempts, sexual abuse, and
<br>
occasionally even &quot;dissapearing&quot; those who get too
<br>
uppity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this may be an impovement over starving to
<br>
death, I hardly consider it &quot;freedom&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers under these conditions are probably even
<br>
worse off than slaves.  If you &quot;own&quot; a slave, you at
<br>
least want them to stay healthy enough to work,
<br>
whereas in a sweatshop if someone is unable or
<br>
unwilling to work (or dies due to work related
<br>
injuries), you can just hire someone new from the
<br>
large pool of unemployed, starving people.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the low wages that are paid to these
<br>
people, even after taking into account the lower
<br>
standard of living, are typically still not a living
<br>
wage.  They are often only paid barely enough to
<br>
survive.
<br>
<p>That's all for now...  A few links:
