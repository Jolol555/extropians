<p>I agree that we don't want to compromise our principals for public 
<br>
image, or try to portray a false image.  However, I have seen too 
<br>
many PR blunders occur too many times because of some public 
<br>
backlash.  In most cases, the backlash was understandable and 
<br>
predictable, even if it was misguided.  If a sudden controversy blows 
<br>
up around us and we suddenly get labeled as a weird cult, that 
<br>
perception will follow us around forever.
<br>
<p>For example, if someone boycotted an abortion clinic because they 
<br>
donated stem cells for research, it might not be wise to 
<br>
counter-boycott.  The message of pro-research would never be heard 
<br>
over the pro/anti abortion debate.  No matter how clearly you explain 
<br>
it to a reporter, we would get reported on TV as the pro-abortionist 
<br>
group.  Even if this is OK, it would make it almost impossible for 
<br>
the real message to get across.  None of the reporters sent to cover 
<br>
the pro/anti abortion conflict will notice a minor story on the side 
<br>
about a group supporting research.
<br>
<p>I cringe at the thought of avoiding a fight because of mistaken 
<br>
perceptions.  However, we do need to choose our battles wisely, and 
<br>
to distribute our scarce resources most effectively.
