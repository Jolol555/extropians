<p><em>&gt; More than that - what's the rationale behind putting all those cables on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the outside of the units? Every cable that pierces the hull is a potential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  leak - and any wiring problems now force an EVA, with attendant loss of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  expensive atmosphere. The cabling is now more susceptible to damage from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  space junk, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What's so difficult about running the cabling and piping inside the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  interconnections?
</em><br>
<p>On one level, the answer lies in pictures of the interior of Mir in its later 
<br>
years.  Mir grew haphazardly and with lots of additions and changes that 
<br>
weren't foreseen when it was originally conceived.  Notice in pictures of Mir 
<br>
that the main openings between modules were full of cabling and hoses.  When 
<br>
they did have to close off one section from another, it proved to be very 
<br>
difficult to figure out how to disconnect those cables so that an air-tight 
<br>
seal could be created between modules.  This presented an extreme safety 
<br>
hazard, as well as a lack of flexibility in reconfiguring the modules.
<br>
<p>There's no question that the ISS design is right in maintaining the main 
<br>
connection between modules as a simple opening for people to pass through 
<br>
that can be easily closed and sealed.  The idea I suggested in my original 
<br>
post could be implemented with a fairly substantial telescoping &quot;raceway&quot; or 
<br>
conduit with automatic couplings for power, signal, air, water and coolant 
<br>
connections.  The more I think about this, the more I realize that there 
<br>
would be a significant weight penalty in implementing this system.  On the 
<br>
one hand, you'd have to have the additional weight of the driving mechanism 
<br>
to connect the conduit-carrier.  On the other, you'd have to have a lot of 
<br>
redundant switching and valving to make the system completely modular.  
<br>
Finally, you'd have to design the system so it could be serviced from the 
<br>
outside and &quot;helped along&quot; manually, if all the connections didn't form up 
<br>
properly.  Even so, the benefit in lower EVA load and forward-compatibility 
<br>
would be significant.
