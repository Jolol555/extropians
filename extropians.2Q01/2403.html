<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 37'th update of my fly longevity experiments.
<br>
In this run I investigated whether further decreasing the pH
<br>
of the fly food improves survival. All bottles except the
<br>
citric acid 1/2 tsp, and the tartaric acid 1/4 tsp, contained
<br>
citric acid 1/4 tsp as a standard additive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubling the amount of citric acid did indeed increase maximum
<br>
lifespan quite remarkably from the control's 66 days to 100 days.
<br>
Average survival was only increased slightly from 49 days to about
<br>
60 days.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that although substituting tartaric for
<br>
citric acid exerted a toxic effect on longevity, there was still
<br>
no evidence of pathogen growth. I do not attribute this difference
<br>
to any special antiaging effect of citric acid. Tartaric acid has
<br>
earlier been shown to be somewhat toxic to flies in a published
<br>
paper. I'll have to try other acids to see if further differences
<br>
occur.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ginkgo biloba has been found to exert a longevity promoting
<br>
effect in rodents. It appears to benefit flies as well.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tested ephedrine and hydroxytryptophan, as these have
<br>
been used as antiobesity drugs in humans. There have been concerns
<br>
about ephedrine increasing stroke risk in humans. High dose ephedrine
<br>
did reduce average longevity in flies, but paradoxially increased
<br>
maximum survival.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inositol has been touted as a non-toxic inhibitor of cancer.
<br>
In the present test it looked fairly safe for flies.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Freezer Run #9, I retested green tea polyphenols, and took
<br>
another look at whey protein. Green tea proved to be a bust this time.
<br>
I'd noticed that the freezing experiment results have much poorer
<br>
reproducibility than the fly longevity tests. However once again whey
<br>
did apear to offer some benefit. Further testing of whey is warrented.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flies were fed the various supplements for 4 days, before
<br>
freezer storage testing. The highest dose of green tea proved to be
<br>
surpisingly toxic.
