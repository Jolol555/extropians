</em><br>
<p>Perhaps Edelman et al. should not snort to much as what is merely
<br>
a single fleeting point in a sequence of architectures. Yes, FPGAs 
<br>
are stupid, yes FPGAs don't compare favourably to brain's fanout 
<br>
and connectivity factors (nanofilaments packed in 3d are hard to be 
<br>
beat to implement a high-connectivity infrastructure) nor in total 
<br>
number of active units, but even current FPGAs need not to remain 
<br>
static. That they're typically that is a more or less deliberate 
<br>
decision on the side of the implementer. She doesn't understand
<br>
circuits which flip through configurations on ms range, especially
<br>
if the circuits themselves decide on which next configuration to
<br>
choose.
<br>
<p>Given that neuronal hardware needs minutes to hours to reconfigure,
<br>
reconfiguration of FPGA cells can (YMMV depending on what silicon
<br>
you have) happen in ns time range.
<br>
<p>But, as I already mentioned, current FPGAs are really lousy, and 
<br>
hence I'm really looking forward to CA-flavoured FPGAs, where a very 
<br>
small cell with a state is directly connected to other cells, arranged 
<br>
as a 2d mosaic. It is hard to predict what the minimum cell size will 
<br>
be, but it will probably be not be a lot larger than a square micron, 
<br>
and switch well in excess of 100 GHz even in current structure size.
<br>
<p>And, of course in computronium the signal-ducting nanofilaments
<br>
(encoded as special cell states) will also be packed in 3d, and 
<br>
a bit denser than in the real thing. Or some other computation
<br>
paradigm might be more useful, encoding information in glider 
<br>
configurations, using a packet switched information delivery to
<br>
nodes arranged on a grid. We don't know yet, but we will. Figuring
<br>
this framework out will be the first step in the parameter
<br>
space search.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the &quot;selectionist&quot; theories of human intelligence espoused by Edelman,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Changeux, Plotkin, et al., &quot;evolution&quot;, in some sense, is a never-ending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process.  Of course, there are nested hierarchies of it -- a person is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born with a fixed genome.  But these folks believe there are somatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes, analogous to Darwinian evolution, that continue throughout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an organism's lifetime.  In contrast, with an evolved FPGA as developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Adrian Thompson, there's a prespecified problem, just as there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in a conventional software-design or electrical engineering application
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain, which is solved without explicit analysis by cranking the handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the magic evolution machine.  But at some point the evolution stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (when the FPGA is deemed to have solved the problem), the chip is plugged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the system and switched on, and becomes just another piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; static hardware.  Same with neural networks -- there's a training set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponding to the problem domain, the network is trained on it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then it's plugged into the OCR program (or whatever), shrink-wrapped,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sold.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, if the prespecified problem itself is shifting, and
<br>
if you're embedded into such a matrix the things are not nearly as 
<br>
deterministic. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Still too static, folks, to be a basis for AI.  When are we going to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware with the sort of continual plasticity and dynamism that nerve tissue has?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I know it's going to be hard.  And, in the meantime, evolved FPGAs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have their uses, if people can trust them to be reliable).
</em><br>
<p>Jim, I think you don't realize what we've got here already even with these
<br>
stupid FPGAs. The brain has several levels of dynamics: the signalling,
<br>
which occurs on the (sub-)ms time scale, adaptation, which takes
<br>
seconds, or longer, and the hardware reconfiguration, which takes minutes,
<br>
hours, or days. In FPGAs already you have two layers: the state which
<br>
defines the hardware connectivity with the state that hardware has at time
<br>
t. 
<br>
<p>In flexibility, that framework is comparable to biology. What limits it
<br>
is the braindead architecture of current FPGAs, the limited integration density,
<br>
the whole thing being fixed into flatland, and -- most importantly -- the
<br>
limitations within designer's heads.
<br>
<p>None of them are likely to remain a constant on the scale of two-three decades.
<br>
Even people do adapt and learn -- occasionally.
