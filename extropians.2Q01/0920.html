</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Also, I think we might be in a time-loop where this period is part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the becoming/being of God[s] which then transcend space-time and become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;part of our being becoming them, if you see what I mean.  The awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and very being is looped upon itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I initially approached the problem of justifying a reliberion in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that fashion, though I somewhat crudely posited that because godlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings could transcend barriers of time, one might currently exist in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal and godlike forms.  You would under that theory have reason to pray to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or curse) the god you will become.  I say &quot;crudely&quot; because how gods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcend time remains, to say the least, a bit unclear.  Positing that by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition a &quot;god&quot; has omnipotence seems a bit of a hack, and handwaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about mysterious and as-of-yet undeveloped technologies hardly improves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters.  So I regard the VR-cum-incubator as a bit more plausible a theory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though to say that it places fewer demands on credulity is not to say that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rises to the level of believability.
</em><br>
<p><p>Hmm. The existing &quot;simultaneously&quot; in normal and godlike form is an
<br>
interesting twist.  I'll give some thought to any interesting seeming
<br>
implications later.  A Power might be able to transcend time (depending
<br>
on how difficult it actually is) without being omnipotent exception in
<br>
potential. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Actually, I think you have a sound beginning of something that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;workable.  Add to that an ethical side of choosing the type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;super/trans/beings we which to become and releasing/transcending our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;current ideational/emotional/psychological bonds that hold us back and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;imprinting new patterns and I think you have most of what is needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those seem like sensible goals writ large, but I am hard-pressed to imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any way to justify ethical precepts except by reference to what might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually help one become a god.  And given that both Nietzcheans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhists pursue an analogous sort of transcendence, it looks unlikely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a general theory will offer one single answer to the problem.  But a
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps not a single answer but many science/progress oriented
<br>
neo-spiritual/ethical viewpoints would be quite useful in motivating and
<br>
inspiring many and in unifying some of the efforts.  It is a thought. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; theology of simulation perhaps demands exactly that sort of diversity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views, given that the simulation aims to generate new beings in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary--and thus competitive--fashion.  So I should think that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reliberion of the sort of describe would operate functionally rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantively, encouraging technologies that promote godhood in general and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the creation of simulated life in particular and celebrating competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between various approaches to that end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think that is a bit more limited than what I have in mind.  I believe
<br>
we need a set of ethical mores and some overarching visions now if we
<br>
are to transition from where we are to the Singulatiry and beyond it
<br>
with greater chance of surviving and thriving.  I don't believe that
<br>
focusing on this being a VR or making a VR per se is that central to
<br>
that.  It is one possible avenue to explore.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;I further think that such a religion might well safe us from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;tremendous amount of pain, unrootedness and random, increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;powerful collisions of differing goal/belief systems as we head toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Singularity.  It might we form a core appealing to both spiritual and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;scientific aspects and people and a crucial point of unity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that's sort of the idea I had in mind: plug the religion meme receptor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site with a theology that would not cause nearly so much harm, would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove inherently distasteful to self-respecting transhumanists, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might serve some important social coordination functions.  I think myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularly (if you'll pardon the pun) unsuited to evangelizing, but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoy the rhetorical exercise.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  That is what I was thinking of.  I also doubt I would make a good
<br>
evangelizer.  Although I am tempted to try when the religious memes are
<br>
continuously bent against all progress.  I personally do believe that
<br>
the species faces a great challenge that requires its growth along
<br>
ethical, psychological and sociological dimensions as well as along
<br>
technological ones.  I believe that visions of that work and how to
<br>
bring it about are very much about real spirituality.  But then I have
<br>
all my life been strongly influenced by both spiritual and scientific
<br>
memes.  But I hardly think I am alone in that.  The great dream of
<br>
Transcendence beats in the hearts of both.
