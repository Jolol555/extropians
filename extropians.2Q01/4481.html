</em><br>
<p>I think that is the better plan, to consider the asteroids like that as
<br>
long term asteroids, and not like icebergs to be towed to port for
<br>
water.
<br>
<p>So, at some point, this is how I see it developing, something is sent
<br>
there that is constructive in nature, it mines the metal ore there,
<br>
smelts and refines it, perhaps in a very small furnace, and there builds
<br>
a station, with the capacity to launch to the other ones.
<br>
<p>Here, nano could be very helpful by being the quantum storage of the
<br>
site plan and when getting there, multiplying off the metal into the
<br>
heavy equipment.  Alternately, the mining might be by multitudinous
<br>
spaceworthy metallic robotic digger wasps, where all the initial mining
<br>
would simply hole a cavity, and the rest would be self contained within
<br>
the rock.
<br>
<p>Now, all this material has value.  For example, throughout the universe,
<br>
there are billions and billions of tons of gold and platinum, more than
<br>
ninety-nine percent of which has absolutely no value to anyone here.  It
<br>
is either not here, or we are not there, thus that extrasolar materials
<br>
have zero impact on our economy.
<br>
<p>Thus, the transportation cost of the self-replicating mining material
<br>
would essentially make in space separate mineral economies.  If that
<br>
station was called Amun, in the Amun economy, a gallon of milk could
<br>
have an economic cost of hundreds thousands of dollars, where steel
<br>
would be free.
<br>
<p>In terms of returnings those materials to Earth, that brings into the
<br>
question heavy drop capabilities, as opposed to heavy lift.  The metals
<br>
could be aeroformed into supertankers and dropped into orbit to reach
<br>
Earth at a leisurely pace, there to float gently to the ocean, and from
<br>
there to port.
