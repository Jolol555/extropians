<p><em>&gt; Wow, so much for analysis and prognostication. Basically, the article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that the technological forecasting is always wrong and always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hideously, overly optimistic.
</em><br>
<p>Tech prognostication is optimistic always in the short term,
<br>
laughably pessimistic always in the long term.
<br>
<p>Consider further that predictions tend toward optimism when
<br>
there is a lot of attention focussed on a situation that is rapidly
<br>
changing.  One can make a lot of &quot;money&quot; in ideas futures by
<br>
understanding this phenomenon.  Consider the price curve of
<br>
the meme &quot;computer defeats world chess champion.&quot;  Over
<br>
the years, the price of this meme went way up each time there
<br>
was a match, even when the experts were pretty much unanimous
<br>
that the human would win.  Drawing attention to the question
<br>
caused optimism that the computer would pull an upset.  It
<br>
did so, by the way, in spite of the expert's predictions, in 1997.
<br>
<p>A more interesting question now would be: when might an
<br>
ordinary desktop computer (under $2k U.S), running commercial
<br>
chess software (under $200 U.S) defeat the reigning world
<br>
champion under match conditions?  Do you notice that the top
<br>
grandmasters are no longer reporting their results against the
<br>
best software?  I suspect that it is scalping them on a regular
<br>
basis these days.  That day of the $2k chess champion is nearly
<br>
upon us as the software evolves and the hardware just keeps
<br>
Moore-ing along.  spike
