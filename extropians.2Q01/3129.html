<p>It's a great idea, but for a few problems:
<br>
<p>1. Tunneling costs at present are very high, and fro economy, the tunnel 
<br>
would have to be virtually leakproof to prevent unnecessary pumping losses.
<br>
2. The &quot;trains&quot; would need life support systems akin to spacecraft, just in 
<br>
case of a stranded train (system failure).
<br>
<p>Once the system is built, if properly designed, the cost of energy needed 
<br>
to transport a train would be tiny, and much of the energy would be 
<br>
recovered in slowing the train for the next station.
<br>
<p>The ultimate system would run at orbital speeds in the tunnel - zero 
<br>
gravity! - and would be able to circumnavigate the planet in about an hour. 
<br>
A realistic system would go slower, since the tunnel would probably not 
<br>
follow a nice orbital curve relative to the center of mass of the planet. 
<br>
ZG might be a selling point for the adventurous...
<br>
<p>I have heard proposals of tunnels driven on chords through the crust - this 
<br>
makes for the shortest ride, but now the intercontinental tunnels are deep 
<br>
enough that materials science would need a big boost to handle the 
<br>
pressures and temperatures. A real honest to goodness force field would be 
<br>
nice for this!
<br>
<p>The problems of transiting plate boundaries and faults would be solved with 
<br>
huge caverns, with the tunnel set up to be flexible enough to survive 
<br>
earthquakes.
<br>
<p>As civil engineering, this would make the huge dams currently under 
<br>
construction in China look like sand box creations...
<br>
<p>Environmentally, the only problem I see is disposal of the tunnel tailings, 
<br>
which might be similar to mine tailings, depending on what rocks the tunnel 
<br>
goes through. It sure can't have the impact a standard road or railroad 
<br>
would! The only visible signs of the system would be the terminals and an 
<br>
occasional power station - these might well be underground, too, especially 
<br>
if the tunnel goes really deep.
