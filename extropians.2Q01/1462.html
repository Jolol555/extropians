<p>Microsoft's War Of Attrition
<br>
Rich Karlgaard, Forbes.com, 03.19.01, 2:21 PM ET
<br>
<p>Consider this pair of data points from last summer:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Steve Ballmer began trashing Net stocks in his public appearances.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Microsoft yanked most its corporate advertising from the Web.
<br>
<p>The last was especially suspicious: Microsoft (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people)
<br>
had its own portal--MSN--to support and was keen to prove its
<br>
&quot;Net-worthiness&quot; to skeptics. So, why would Microsoft debunk the Net in word
<br>
and deed and risk looking old economy or hypocritical?
<br>
<p>Simple. Perhaps there was a higher priority. Maybe Microsoft decided to
<br>
start a war of attrition.
<br>
<p>This time last year, Yahoo! (nasdaq: YHOO - news - people) was worth $96
<br>
billion, Sun Microsystems (nasdaq: SUNW - news - people) worth $150 billion,
<br>
and America Online (nyse: AOL - news - people) worth more than $200 billion.
<br>
Against this inflated dot-com currency, Microsoft's $24 billion bank
<br>
balance--a huge cache by any measure--was rendered strategically impotent.
<br>
<p>Microsoft was suddenly impotent in other ways--and not just from its
<br>
smackdown by the Clinton Administration's Department of Justice, either.
<br>
Between 1995 and 2000 Microsoft, like all older companies, suffered a brain
<br>
drain. Young talent was migrating to the dot-com world. This loss was
<br>
particularly galling to Bill Gates, who prides himself on his ability to
<br>
recruit the best and brightest. (Gates once told me, in the early 1990s,
<br>
that Goldman Sachs was his chief competitor. Huh? I asked. &quot;Sure,&quot; said
<br>
Gates. &quot;We compete in the same IQ pool as the top investment banks.&quot;)
<br>
<p>Losing talent and watching cash decline in relative terms, it's my guess
<br>
that Gates and Ballmer decided enough was enough--it's time to go to war
<br>
against these troublesome dot-coms. But rather than launching a direct
<br>
attack--a political and public relations nonstarter since the DOJ was
<br>
breathing down its neck--the company stealthily set out to wreck
<br>
competitors' currency.
<br>
<p>Classic! Brilliant! And totally expected, hatched as it was from the minds
<br>
of those two 800-math-SAT-scoring chess masters from Redmond. Ballmer is out
<br>
the next day trashing Net valuations. And back home, Gates gets the word to
<br>
the Microsoft ad department to stop all of its corporate advertising online
<br>
for the remainder of 2000. Gates knows such Microsoft cooling on the Web
<br>
would give license to chief executives around the world to cut their Web
<br>
advertising, too. (Gee, if the brilliant Gates is doing it...) And that's
<br>
precisely what happens.
<br>
<p>This Microsoft strategy--and it's only a speculation--came to fruition last
<br>
week when Yahoo! shocked Wall Street with sales figures 25% below estimates.
<br>
Yahoo!'s market value immediately sank to a three-year low of $7 billion.
<br>
Microsoft's cash balance, meanwhile, rose to $27 billion. Translation:
<br>
Microsoft could buy Yahoo! for pocket change if it wanted.
<br>
<p>The dot-com plague has spread to Net infrastructure giants like Oracle
<br>
(nasdaq: ORCL - news - people) and Sun--the two hated Silicon Valley rivals
<br>
of Microsoft who funded the legal assault that began in Palo Alto, Calif.,
<br>
five years ago and wound up at the Clinton DOJ. Sun is twice damned: its
<br>
stock down 70%, and half its employees with options underwater. Meanwhile,
<br>
Sun's beleaguered sales force is vainly trying to extract profit from its
<br>
new severs. From California to Virginia, these slick boxes must compete
<br>
against thousands of year-old boxes from hundreds of dot-com liquidation
<br>
sales.
<br>
<p>Boy, has that shut up Sun's Scott McNealy for awhile! Come to think of it,
<br>
if you're Gates and Ballmer, you couldn't have planned this little Web
<br>
Armageddon any better. Cash is king once more, and Microsoft wields $27
<br>
billion of it. Talent is fleeing back to Redmond. The once uppity Yahoo!
<br>
goes begging for white knight. Sweetest of all, those loudmouths Larry
<br>
Ellison and McNealy have been gagged for a season.
<br>
<p>Bill and Steve couldn't have planned it better.

<p>Here and abroad, the Internet is no longer easy money, which probably
explains last week's abrupt resignations of both Yahoo! Europe Managing
Director Fabiola Arredondo and Yahoo! Asia Managing Director Savio Chow.
Both said publicly they were leaving for personal reasons, but industry
insiders speculate that when the going got tough, these two top execs got
going--with hefty options packages in hand.
