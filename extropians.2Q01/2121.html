<p>John, do you remember the flap about test tube babies in the 70s?
<br>
All we really had to do is just DO IT.  Then a few years later, everyone
<br>
could see these children that some considered unethically conceived.
<br>
They were regular people, who had souls (whatever that means),
<br>
they were real people.  The debate went away.  I seldom hear anyone
<br>
protesting in-vitro fertilization today.
<br>
<p>What we need is a body transplant patient  to get in front
<br>
of the TV and say &quot;I am paralysed, but I am a still a person,
<br>
I have feelings, and I am alive because of a novel
<br>
medical technique.&quot;  The debate would fade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose, for example, someone signs off on the donor thing for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fresh corpse--only to learn later that the corpse is walking around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with someone else's head attached. suppose further that they sue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;I didn't sign off on this; I want the body cremated.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Easy.  Tell them that the body *will* be cremated,
<br>
whenever the head now attached to it is finished with it.
<br>
<p>Actually I seriously doubt anyone would sue to have
<br>
someone killed.  Body transplant advocates might want
<br>
to intentionally sue, after the operation, simply to
<br>
have the proletariat rise up and say &quot;spare the head!&quot;
<br>
<p>I suspect in this big world we could find a family *eager*
<br>
to donate the entire body of a braindead member in an
<br>
attempt to save a terminal paralysed patient.  We really
<br>
only need one, to start with, to show that the person we
<br>
are *really does* reside entirely in the brain.  spike
