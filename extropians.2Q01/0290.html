Altair's Nano Materials Plant Operational
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
CODY, Wyo., March 8 /PRNewswire/ -- Altair International Inc. (Nasdaq: &lt;A 
<br>
HREF=&quot;aol://4785:ALTI&quot;&gt;ALTI&lt;/A&gt;) today announced that its wholly owned 
<br>
subsidiary, Altair Technologies, Inc. (www.altairtechnologies.com) has placed 
<br>
in operation its integrated pilot scale process unit capable of producing 
<br>
kilogram per day quantities of nanoparticles.  When Altair announced 
<br>
commencement of construction of the plant we indicated that it was designed 
<br>
to produce a wide variety of nanomaterials in sample quantities, without 
<br>
interrupting the commercial facilities.  In response to recent market demand 
<br>
for alternative energy devices, initial runs successfully produced lithium 
<br>
titanate for advanced energy storage devices and zirconium dioxide for fuel 
<br>
cells. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This plant is a key component of Altair's plan and I am delighted that it is 
<br>
operating so successfully,&quot; said Mr. Ken Lyon, president of Altair 
<br>
Technologies.  &quot;This will allow us to produce quality nanomaterials for many 
<br>
developing markets including catalysts, cosmetics, paints, hard-coatings, 
<br>
fuel cells, energy storage devices, computers, semi-conductors, 
<br>
telecommunications and environmental remediation.  Altair Technologies is 
<br>
focusing its product development activities on alternative energy and 
<br>
high-tech markets.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Altair International owns a proprietary technology for making nanocrystalline 
<br>
materials of unique quality, economically in large quantities. The company is 
<br>
currently developing special nanomaterials with potential applications in 
<br>
fuel cells, hard coatings, catalysts, cosmetics, paints, energy storage 
<br>
devices, semi-conductors, telecommunications and environmental remediation.  
<br>
The technology may also be used to make paint pigment at a cost forecast to 
<br>
be substantially lower than commercial technologies employed today.  Altair 
<br>
holds mineral leases on a world class titanium mineral sand deposit in 
<br>
Tennessee and is in the process of constructing a pilot plant at that site.  
<br>
The company's other principle asset is the Altair Centrifugal Jig, an 
<br>
environmentally friendly breakthrough technology for mining, coal treatment 
<br>
and environmental remediation. 
<br>
<p>This press release may be deemed to contain certain forward-looking 
<br>
statements with respect to Altair that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
<br>
that include, but are not limited to, Altair's ability to obtain necessary 
<br>
capital, performance and reliability of technology, market acceptance of 
<br>
products using Altair technology, variance in anticipated production costs 
<br>
and unanticipated effects of regulatory requirements related to the 
<br>
technology, as well as those identified in the Company's press releases or 
<br>
discussed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange 
<br>
Commission filings. Actual results may vary materially. 
<br>
