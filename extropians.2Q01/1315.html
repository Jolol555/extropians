<p>&lt;&lt; Okay, to start: we may not be agreeing about what a zombie is. 
<br>
&nbsp;Here is Dennett's definition, p. 72-73 of Consciousness
<br>
&nbsp;Explained: &quot;According to common agreement among philosophers,
<br>
&nbsp;a zombie is or would be a human being who exhibits perfectly 
<br>
&nbsp;natural, alert, loquascious, vivacious behavior but is in
<br>
&nbsp;fact not conscious at all, but rather some sort of automaton.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Of course, you may mean by &quot;conscious&quot; something a little
<br>
&nbsp;different from what the philosophers mean, (or are trying
<br>
&nbsp;to mean!), also.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Let's proceed slowly, here, and sorry that space prevents
<br>
&nbsp;me from replying at length to all your points today.

Zombie would seem to indicate that the purpose of such programs is to 
<br>
convince a &quot;self-aware&quot; observer, that the zombies are, in fact, self-aware 
<br>
individuals. The similarity would be the section of the Enterprise Computer 
<br>
systems (gee whiz! memetic gel-packets) for the series STNG, that supplied 
<br>
the &quot;holograms&quot; with adequate behavior instructions, for interactions with 
<br>
the Enterprise crew, at play.  When a Zombie became self-aware (conscious)  
<br>
Professor Moriarity, he ceased being a zombie and became an individual 
<br>
personality, a mind. 
<br>
<p>Not that many philosophers watched the Trek episodes, except for that one 
<br>
fellow from Australia, several years back, and thus talk chiefly amongst 
<br>
themselves. Few actual philosophers take the large view of a Max More. Hence, 
<br>
most of us happily turn to scientists, for inspiration and each other. (Group 
<br>
Hug) Ugh!
