<p>The problem is not special effects. They have plenty of that, and in fact could

do with a lot less. The problem is to hire decent technical advisers, and *listen*
<br>
to what they're saying. (Provided, you're a perfectionist, and intend to satisfy
<br>
both the 100 ppm geeks as well as the average global village idiot. Otherwise,
<br>
disregard this fortune cookie).
