<p>Chip of Fools
<br>
<p>By PAUL KRUGMAN
<br>
<p>t the level of bits and bytes, the most surprising thing about the
<br>
advance
<br>
of information technology has been the absence of surprises. Back in
<br>
1965
<br>
Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, predicted that the number of
<br>
transistors
<br>
on a chip would henceforth double every 18 to 24 months - and Moore's
<br>
Law
<br>
has worked like digital clockwork ever since. But the translation of
<br>
bits
<br>
and bytes into dollars and cents is far harder to predict. And so it is
<br>
no
<br>
wonder, or cause for shame, when smart people get the economic impact of
<br>
technology wrong.
<br>
For the last few years, the joke has been on those - including me - who
<br>
were skeptical about the economic payoff to information processing. Now,
<br>
alas, it is the optimists who look foolish. They thought the &quot;new
<br>
economy&quot;
<br>
would be not only faster-growing but more stable than the old economy.
<br>
What
<br>
we've learned in the last few months - most recently in Monday's grim
<br>
news
<br>
from Cisco Systems - is that they were wrong.
<br>
A brief history of the economics of information technology would go like
<br>
this: From the early 1970's until the middle of the 1990's technology
<br>
was a
<br>
big disappointment. Nifty gadgets like the fax machine became widely
<br>
available, yet seemed to do little or nothing for the overall
<br>
productivity
<br>
of the economy. Many of us glumly concluded that the U.S. economy was
<br>
stuck
<br>
with a disappointing long-run growth rate of around 2.5 percent.
<br>
And then, around 1995, everything changed. For reasons that are still
<br>
unclear, suddenly all that investment in information technology started
<br>
to
<br>
pay off. Those who had called the turn correctly - like Alan Greenspan -
<br>
looked brilliant, while those of us who had been reluctant to change our
<br>
views began to feel silly.
<br>
Meanwhile the optimists began to hail the new economy not just for its
<br>
growth but for its stability. Articles with titles like &quot;The End of the
<br>
Business Cycle&quot; started to receive favorable attention. Even sober
<br>
analysts
<br>
began to question the classic script for a slump, in which a slowdown in
<br>
consumer spending and investment leads to a buildup of business
<br>
inventories, and businesses are then forced into severe production
<br>
cutbacks
<br>
to work off those inventories.
<br>
No more, said the optimists. Here's how one starry-eyed observer put it:
<br>
&quot;The same forces that have been boosting growth in structural
<br>
productivity
<br>
seem also to have accelerated the process of cyclical adjustment. . . .
<br>
New
<br>
technologies for supply-chain management and flexible manufacturing
<br>
imply
<br>
that businesses can perceive imbalances in inventories at a very early
<br>
stage - virtually in real time - and can cut production promptly in
<br>
response to the developing signs of unintended inventory building.&quot;
<br>
Whoops. In fact, as demand from consumers leveled off last year,
<br>
American
<br>
businesses were slow to cut production, and ended up with huge excess
<br>
inventories. And some of the worst stories of excess inventory
<br>
accumulation
<br>
involve companies selling the very information systems that were
<br>
supposed
<br>
to make that &quot;real time&quot; management possible.
<br>
Cisco, whose equipment plays a key role in the Internet - and which has
<br>
presented itself as the very model of a modern e-business - is the case
<br>
in
<br>
point. The company's woes aren't simply a matter of declining demand; it
<br>
also failed to adjust, ramping up inventories just as the bottom fell
<br>
out
<br>
of sales. Now it has taken a $2.5 billion write-down on inventory that
<br>
it
<br>
expects to sell only at reduced prices.
<br>
It may take some time to figure out what went wrong. Perhaps it was
<br>
business strategy: Cisco used the Internet to become a &quot;virtual
<br>
company,&quot;
<br>
with most of its products manufactured by others, reducing costs but
<br>
perhaps also reducing control. And perhaps some of it was sheer hubris:
<br>
technology may have given managers the illusion that they knew more than
<br>
they did. One friend points out that high-tech managers insisting that
<br>
they
<br>
had everything under control sounded a bit like old-fashioned Soviet
<br>
central planners.
<br>
What's important is that policy makers realize that some of the happier
<br>
tales of the new economy were only myths. We must hope that comforting
<br>
stories that we now know to be untrue haven't bred a sense of
<br>
complacency.
<br>
And that's where I get a bit nervous. For that romantic fantasy about
<br>
&quot;real
<br>
time&quot; adjustment was a quotation from Alan Greenspan's testimony on
<br>
monetary policy, less than two months ago.
