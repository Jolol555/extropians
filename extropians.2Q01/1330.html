<p>Yeah, it's overdue. Actually, since matter tends to aggregate in
<br>
recursive/hierarchical arrangements, you need to retain several
<br>
positioning system (me-relative (ultrasonics and solid state camera),
<br>
Earth-relative (GPS), Sun-relative (SPS), Galaxy-relative (er, UPS, I
<br>
guess)), and use coordinate transforms from one another.
<br>
<p>Actually, with IPv6 you can combine the logical and physical addresses,
<br>
e.g. by shifting WGS 84 latitude/longitude/altitude to 32 bit each,
<br>
reserving the leading 32 bit of an IPv6 address for future purposes.
<br>
If I get my math right, that's about 1 cm resolution at Earth surface (so
<br>
it's not enough for nano, blame the IPv6 designers. If one thinks of it,
<br>
there are lots more of addressable objects in the local galaxy that
<br>
can be described by 32 bit either. Clearly we shouldn't have settled
<br>
with mere 128 bit but would have gone straight to 256 bits).

<p>I don't know, wouldn't a few low-res solid state cameras would give you
<br>
plenty on orientation relatively to stars, and more than a bit of
<br>
navigation when used with planets, if equipped with a good clock? Given
<br>
that we now have 3-axis accelerometers with better than 1e-6 g resoltion,
<br>
there is probably not all that much requirements for a solar positioning
<br>
system (SPS). Plus, with isotropic radiators you'll need a lot of wattage
<br>
to cover the terrain, unless you stud the space evenly with nodes each
<br>
covering a space of a lightsecond, or so.
<br>
<p>What probes really need are built-in survival reflexes. A little orrery in
<br>
their digital brain, which plots their future course, and some dumb AI
<br>
which knows &quot;it is probably not a good idea to fly into solid objects at
<br>
Mach 19&quot;, &quot;account for estimated future burns in respect to fuel use&quot;,
<br>
etc. This will make them refuse obviously suicidal instructions, unless
<br>
explicitly overriden.

<p><em>&gt; what? Why are we still using ancient navigation techniques? There should

<p>Neat.
<br>
<p>Maybe you can help me:
<br>
<p>When thinking about a cloud of coke-can sized satellites for digital pulse
<br>
radio and wireless networking (no stabilization, realtime beamforming
<br>
using active antennas), one has the following problems: the systems need
<br>
to be gossamer, yet able to survival rough (shrapnel-size) deployments.
<br>
Initially I thought about using vanilla rectangular monocrystalline Si
<br>
cells on springed hinges (jack-in-the-box type panel unfolding). However,
<br>
these things are rather brittle. So I thought freezing the sat into a
<br>
sublimating solid cube (water, or dry ice), which will vanish within
<br>
few hours under orbital conditions. However, this will eliminate the
<br>
advantages due to higher weight. I then thought of a photolythic foam
<br>
envelope, then of a pyrotechnical envelope (shrapnel deployment scenari),
<br>
which doubles as protection and propulsion.
<br>
<p>Any ideas in that area?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; thickness, pressure, contents. Maneuvering thrusters will be solid state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pulse ignition chemical micro-thrusters off-the-shelf. Navigation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depend on SSPS to be in place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You decide what payload you want and how quickly you want it wherever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are going. I figure with this size bus you could deliver a laptop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sized replicator facility to any NEA within a few months of launch.
</em><br>
<p>Officer, arrest that man. He's obviously dangerous.
