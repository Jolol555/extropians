<p>&lt;&lt; An excellent idea, a straightforward idea, an old idea. Does he spout
<br>
&nbsp;at least as much equations as Tipler? How many falsifyable predictions
<br>
&nbsp;produces his theory (it is a physical theory, right?). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>To be honest with you, I was surprised that Smolin said anything truly, 
<br>
novel, such as what I had quoted before. I do remember searching Lanl for 
<br>
some work with the math of it, and such, but I don't remember if I obtained 
<br>
any hits. Smolin, as you probably know, is one of the bigger, promoters, or 
<br>
multiple universes, generated by Linde and Guth's Inflation process. I was 
<br>
genuinely surprised that Smolin had any opinions on the human future, and so 
<br>
considered his comments quote-worthy. He did not have any math to corroborate 
<br>
hs comments, in the article. I assumed that he wouldn't have bothered 
<br>
speaking of such an idea unless he had previously, given some thought. If he 
<br>
does have anymore to say about it, I surely, would be interested.
