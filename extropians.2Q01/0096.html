<p>Umm...miscommunication.  I meant as in a railgun or coilgun - where
<br>
the propellant is (hopefully!) non-explosive - in order to get higher
<br>
exhaust velocity, and thus a lower mass fraction.  (Checking a bit into
<br>
this, I'd probably want coilgun, since that's simpler and doesn't wear
<br>
down its rails during normal operation.  Simple good.  No-self-hurt
<br>
good.  Of course, that's assuming I can get the necessary power...but
<br>
then, I was already looking into plasma rockets, which have similar
<br>
concerns in that regard.)

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anything that can be done with one stage can be done better with two.  spike
</em><br>
<p>I heard they're having a really hard time getting non-final stages to
<br>
be reused.  Which means they have to remanufacture the lower stages.
<br>
No prob if the lower stages were cheap, but they're not.  That's the
<br>
main point of SSTO: if your entire vehicle is designed for reuse, then
<br>
you can spread the cost of the entire vehicle over multiple launches,
<br>
thus you get cheap per-launch.
<br>
<p>Now, that being said, I've seen the same problem you identify.  Counter
<br>
(or, source of) problem: how do you identify &quot;this design objective
<br>
leads to cheapness&quot; where there's little obvious connection between
<br>
cost and engineering objectives?  (It seems that one could do a cost
<br>
breakdown of current examples - specifically the shuttle - to find out
<br>
what not to do again.  Unless that data is has already been obtained,
<br>
but then, how would one gain access to it?)
