For me, this is one additional reason to focus on the 
<br>
physics-astronomy-cosmology manipulations of Extropian proposals and 
<br>
conjectures, understanding that if cryogenics or 21st century uploading 
<br>
really pays off, that would be fabulous. But unless we have these 
<br>
technologies at hand, we may indeed have to await the opening of The 
<br>
Restaurant at the End of the Universe 
<br>
Sadly, Yours

<p>Author Douglas Adams, who wrote The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, has 
<br>
died suddenly aged 49. 
<br>
Mr Adams died on Friday morning in Santa Barbara, California, following a 
<br>
heart attack, said his spokeswoman Sophie Astin. 
<br>
<p>Adams's novel was turned into a BBC series 
<br>
The author became a household name when the cult science fiction novel was 
<br>
turned into a BBC TV series. 
<br>
Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952 and educated in Essex before returning to 
<br>
Cambridge to study at St John's College. 
<br>
His career included work as a radio and television writer and producer before 
<br>
his life was changed by the publication of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
<br>
Galaxy in 1979. 
<br>
<p>Film
<br>
<p>The satirical tale chronicled the journey of alien Ford Prefect and his human 
<br>
companion Arthur Dent throughout the universe after the destruction of Earth. 
<br>
<p>It centred around the search for an answer to life, the universe, and 
<br>
everything - which turned out to be 42. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Arthur Dent and Slartibartfast became cult figures
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The novel went on to sell more than 14 million copies worldwide and was 
<br>
followed by the sequels The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the 
<br>
Universe and Everything and So Long and Thanks For All the Fish. 
<br>
<p>In recent years the author had been working on a Hitchhiker's Guide movie. 
<br>
<p>There was much speculation about who would play Arthur Dent, with Hugh 
<br>
Laurie, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carrey, Ben Affleck and even Bruce Willis said to 
<br>
be in the running. 
<br>
<p>Adams married Jane Belson in 1991 and had a daughter, Polly, in 1994.
