<em>&gt;

<p>This is very interesting for me. I haven't read Wright's book but I am
<br>
familiar with that line of thought. I am very sceptical of the strong
<br>
teleological model which sees History as the inevitable unfolding of an
<br>
inherent neccessity, both because I reject the philosophical basis for most
<br>
such models and because I think the empirical evidence contradicts it. So I
<br>
am not keen on the idea of History as leading inevitably up to
<br>
Singularity/Communism/the Second Coming/Liberal Democracy or whatever. I am
<br>
much more sympathetic to a weaker form which says that certain developments
<br>
are not inevitable but if they do occurr they become very difficult to stop
<br>
or reverse. So, human beings remained hunter-gatherers for a long time and
<br>
it was not inevitable that they would discover agriculture but once they had
<br>
the spread of agriculture and other institutions such as money, trade,
<br>
cities and government (and religion?) was inevitable and ultimately
<br>
unstoppable. This implies that the appearance of a technologically
<br>
innovative civilisation was a matter of chance but, now that it has
<br>
happened, it's unavoidable and irreversible.
<br>
&nbsp;However I would make one caveat: My personal view is that historically,
<br>
after agriculture comes along, there a series of levels of social
<br>
organisation/technological development which we can think of as equilibrium
<br>
points. There are several examples of a society suddenly and
<br>
catastrophically collapsing from one equilibrium to a lower one. This
<br>
involves a marked diminution in division of labour, much less trade, more
<br>
local self sufficiency, reduced urbanisation, less literacy/numeracy and a
<br>
decline in the use of a whole range of technologies even when, as often
<br>
happens, the knowledge of the technology remains. The best known case is the
<br>
collapse of classical civilisation in the 5th/6th centuries but the most
<br>
spectacular is the sudden demise of Mayan civilisation. So I wouldn't assume
<br>
nothing can go wrong. I'm not worried by kooks like Zerzan as much as
<br>
selfish and short sighted elites - they are more dangerous because they have
<br>
the power!
