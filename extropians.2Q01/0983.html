<em>&gt; &gt;I mustn't let the simulation discussion end without mentioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the _ST: TNG_ episode[s] &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; [and &quot;The Inner Light&quot;]...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can think of two others but not their titles;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first was in the final series of TNG if memory serves, where Riker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flicks back and forth between a high tech &quot;prison&quot; and a theatre piece he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is acting in on the Enterprise.  Of course, the play he is in looks exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the cell he's stuck in.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I remember this.  Sixth ('92-'93, out of seven) season episode
<br>
&quot;Frame of Mind&quot; (#147), 
<br>
<a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~hwloidl/TL/tng6/frame.html">http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~hwloidl/TL/tng6/frame.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The other was in Deep Space 9, where Chief O'Brien finds himself in cramped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prison, where the only way to pass the time is to create intricate patterns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the sand on the floor of his cell, tutored by his cellmate (whom he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually kills, believing he witheld food).  After years of this, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanying guilt over the murder, he suddenly finds himself back in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, where he finds out that it was all in his mind, the method of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;punishment&quot; used by a civilization whose rules he broke while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visiting.  What seemed to him like years took only hours.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I saw this one, too.  It was fourth ('95-'96, out of seven) season
<br>
episode &quot;Hard Time&quot; (episode #89):
<br>
<a href="http://www.thelogbook.com/log/deeplog4.html#dsn089">http://www.thelogbook.com/log/deeplog4.html#dsn089</a>
<br>
<p>Like &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, both of these shows involved feeding experiences into
<br>
Riker's or O'Brien's biological brain, rather than a simulated universe
<br>
inside a computer.
<br>
<p>The literary prototype for all stories like &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, &quot;Frame of Mind&quot;,
<br>
and &quot;Hard Time&quot;, for me, was the Alan E. Nourse story &quot;Nightmare Brother&quot; (1953),
<br>
which I must have read in 5th or 6th grade
<br>
( <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/isfdb-bin/exact_author.cgi?Alan_E._Nourse">http://www.sfsite.com/isfdb-bin/exact_author.cgi?Alan_E._Nourse</a> ).
<br>
Gee, most of the people who wrote the stories I read as a kid
<br>
are dead now :-&lt;.
<br>
<p>A more recent example, still more like the above three stories than like
<br>
the pure simulation scenario of &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot;, would be the
<br>
_Voyager_ two-part episode ('99-'00 season 6 cliffhanger, '00-'01 season 7
<br>
premiere) &quot;Unimatrix Zero&quot; (now where did they get the idea for **that**
<br>
title, I wonder?), which had a common virtual-reality zone created by a
<br>
handful of defective Borg drones while they're regenerating, and of
<br>
which they have no memory while awake.
