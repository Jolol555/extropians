<em>&gt; &gt; If a 100,000:1 genius is interacting with a 10,000,000:1 genius, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neither of them knows the other's percentile, both will rationally assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they are more likely to be rational than the other person.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Robin's paper does prove that in *most* cases, rather than in the rarer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instances where two geniuses unknowingly interact, people must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overestimating their own rationality relative to others, or else must not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be using rigorous Bayesian reasoning with respect to what they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; licensed to conclude from their own thoughts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that if both parties clearly explain their understanding about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this paradoxical result, each would be forced to accept that the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had made at least a prima facie case for being rational enough for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result to apply.  They should then feel mutually bound to reach agreement.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I have this wacky idea that says it's ethically prohibited to
<br>
apply Bayesian priors to people.  In other words, you should judge a
<br>
person's properties - intelligence levels, for example - only by
<br>
information that is directly revealing of those properties, and not
<br>
through other properties that happen to be weakly or strongly associated,
<br>
especially if those properties happen to be outside the person's direct
<br>
manipulative control.  For example, if a nine-year-old were to walk up to
<br>
me and ask a question that I would take seriously if an adult had asked
<br>
it, I am obliged to answer as I would an adult, and am not permitted to
<br>
take any action predicated on my knowledge of chronological age until the
<br>
person in question makes some statement that is actually revealing of
<br>
nine-year-old characteristics.  (Not in the sense of &quot;being interpretable
<br>
as being revealing of youth&quot;, but in the sense of being a statement that
<br>
would *only* have been generated by a youth and not by an adult, or a very
<br>
high-probability equivalent of same.)
<br>
<p>So if someone says &quot;I'm smarter than you, Eliezer!&quot; I would certainly feel
<br>
obliged to assume (or rather, act under the assumption) that the person in
<br>
question is as likely to be smarter than me as I am to be smarter than
<br>
them, at least until the person makes some other statement revealing of
<br>
actual intelligence levels, which generally doesn't take too long.
