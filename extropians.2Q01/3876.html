<p>Yes.  But this immediately brings up the question of whether the
<br>
singularity has a general S or sigmoid shape or not.  If there is
<br>
an upper level of progress, (i.e. computation density, speed-up
<br>
factor, and so on), then your observation is exactly right.
<br>
<p>But if there is no upper limit---which many of the people who have
<br>
been thinking more about the singularity than I have    appear to 
<br>
believe---then it's not clear that any information from these
<br>
remote sources would be of any interest whatsoever (except perhaps
<br>
to satisfy historical antiquarian instincts).  In other words, to
<br>
the extent that the &quot;singlularity&quot; indeed is a true singularity,
<br>
then data from elsewhere becomes redundant as well as boring.
