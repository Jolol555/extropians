<p>That time travel thing would be pretty cool.  It would seem, in some ways,
<br>
that if there is time travel then that would be a very good mechanism for
<br>
space travel by teleportation.  For example, a few years ago they
<br>
&quot;teleported&quot; some molecules around, or that was the information.
<br>
<p>Time travel is among the &quot;space opera&quot; science fiction themes, for example,
<br>
many people have heard of time travel in various forms since Welles'
<br>
fictional machine.  One regular question is that of the meeting grandparents,
<br>
to go back in time and cause events that would make going back in time
<br>
impossible.  This kind of research brings perhaps a more serious light to the
<br>
speculative fiction of time travel.
<br>
<p>About the matter teleportation, to refer to exploitation of solar resources,
<br>
if that was effective then it could be economical for freight.  In the book
<br>
&quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;, they made a movie about it, the voracious mining aliens
<br>
used teleportation and the privacy of it to exert economic control, until
<br>
near the end of the book, when all of them were killed for Terl and some
<br>
females, from whom the protagonists removed the brain devices, where Terl did
<br>
not have one.  In &quot;Star Trek&quot; personal teleportation is a given, although the
<br>
&quot;Star Trek&quot; version had only an intersystem range where the other was
<br>
extragalactic, from which we got people saying &quot;beam me up&quot; for years.
<br>
<p>A concern about the introduction of negative energy or anti-energy is that it
<br>
is difficult to say that some experiment would not metaphorically tear the
<br>
spacetime fabric and explode this neighborhood of the galaxy.  From what I
<br>
understand about antimatter, it has been produced in miniscule amounts in the
<br>
lab, or observed, where its most well-known property is to react with matter
<br>
in an abrupt way.  It can be contained with magnetic shielding, and there has
<br>
never been enough of it to risk more than the lab.
<br>
<p>I am reading a book about genetic biochemistry, it is by Asimov and called
<br>
&quot;The Genetic Code&quot;.  It is from 1962, about forty years ago.  I have read
<br>
much of the Asimov fiction, and was pleased to see that his non-fiction
<br>
remains very readable.  It has helped me to understand some of the
<br>
biochemistry associated with the nucleotides in the nucleic acid in the first
<br>
chapters.
<br>
<p>Here, these subjects are wide-ranging, with each deserving diverse
<br>
investigation.  By the same token, they are happening concurrently, so that
<br>
as we examine their meaning for humanity, they may be considered as part of a
<br>
whole, where that is the extant body and practice of human knowledge, and the
<br>
implications of imminent advances of science and technology.
<br>
<p>Ross.
