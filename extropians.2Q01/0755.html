<p>Well, Robin, *most* of the baryonic matter in the universe *is*
<br>
unaccounted for.   We don't have sufficiently good statistics
<br>
yet to know for sure that some stars are not in fact going dark.
<br>
The missions over the next decade should begin to give us enough
<br>
long term studies of enough stars (up to a billion or so) that
<br>
we can put constraints on the scenario that you suggest (and
<br>
Eric briefly investigated many years ago).
<br>
<p>There are classes of stars called Long-period variable stars
<br>
where astronomers have not studied them for sufficiently 
<br>
to know that their period is.  Scientists have however published
<br>
reports (unfortunately as posters, not as more complete studies)
<br>
that more stars are growing dimer than are growing brighter
<br>
(though you have to be careful because this could simply be
<br>
an aspect of how their brightness varies).
<br>
<p>Here is an economics question for you -- how do you value
<br>
&quot;present&quot; thought against &quot;future&quot; thought?  I.e. If you
<br>
start disassembling the planets and find your energy resources
<br>
growing as you make the KT-I to KT-II transition you can use
<br>
that energy to power your computronium or use it to harvest
<br>
more energy that you dedicate to getting more material so
<br>
you can construct &quot;better&quot; computronium.  As Dyson pointed
<br>
out you need the full solar output for ~800 years to
<br>
disassemble Jupiter -- but if you dedicate all the available power
<br>
to say the &quot;sub-optimal&quot; computronium of your MBrain, then Jupiter
<br>
will never get disassembled.
<br>
<p>How do you make the tradeoff between a &quot;lot&quot; of cycles now and
<br>
somewhat more cycles later (if you sacrifice the cycles now)?
<br>
<p>Can you imagine a scenario in which the universe looks the way
<br>
it does now because the posthumans simply got wrapped up in
<br>
their simulations and forgot to harvest the remnants that we
<br>
now see?
<br>
