From: &quot;Damien Broderick&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20The%20most%20compelling%20argument%20against%20extropian%20ideas&In-Reply-To=&lt;2b3d01c0b830$39bcf640$915d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; If you want to become a cyborg yourself, do so, your values are obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deranged anyway. But please keep the technology to yourselves, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are vulnerable people out there, the same ones who kill themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with heroin in a foolish search for diversion from what, sadly, they see as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a meaningless and hopeless life.
</em><br>
<p>Tell you what, Damien. We're all fortunate that Ted Kaczynski did *not* have
<br>
you for his speech writer. You make this guy sound like Chief Seattle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This `cyborg' choice, like drug or gambling addiction , is NOT a fun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative to living a complex human life, learning to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frustration and pain and the risks of love in the way that only a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being can, unlike a programmed computer--it's life as what Phil Dick called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an `electric ant', pre-programmed and meaningless. Yet people keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to vitiate their rich humanity and replace senstitive awareness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice with stupor or mechanical `canned' routines? Why? Why?
</em><br>
<p>Well, now... here we get a little carried away. Yes, why *does* the question
<br>
why occur?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In promoting this terrible anti-human choice, in helping make it possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for people to believe that it's better to be a machine than a person, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collude with those who would destroy humanity. Why? Why? What the hell's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *wrong* with you?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, I don't know, and Nothing, to answer the questions in the order
<br>
asked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your self-destructive project will defeat every softer alternative, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavy tanks crush soft human bodies and seductive but wicked ideas seduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation after generation into ruin. It's beyond comprehension that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain so susceptible to the lure of the death-lovers, but we do, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will win, you damned maniacs.
</em><br>
<p>You could make billions as an attorney. (Maybe you have, and didn't feel like
<br>
mentioning it.) Doesn't matter, there is no softer alternative, because there
<br>
is no alternative. This fact may cause discomfort, but nothing compared to the
<br>
torment of knowing that humanity teeters on the brink of cognitive phase
<br>
transition. We're damned demigods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this cry of pain and rage must be met with a considered reply,
</em><br>
<p>I think you're right, and only you could compose such a reply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that points out that (for example) enhancement of current human capacities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is NOT the same as repudiation of human decencies, of love, of all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values typically and often legitimately seen as threatened by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `mechanisation', `global rationality', etc.
</em><br>
<p>OK, we're only arguing against the hypothetical cry of pain you've given
<br>
character to, but enhancement of current human capacities threatens the State
<br>
of Arkansas (as just one example), which recently legislated against teaching
<br>
biological evolution uncontaminated by creationism. When you get a chance to
<br>
crush this regressive force, it makes sense to use the opportunity.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia
