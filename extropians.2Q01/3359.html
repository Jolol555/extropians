<em>&gt;From this speculation, it would seem then, that we need to hedge our bets and 
</em><br>
build pre-Singularity level, but still very intelligent computers, to effect 
<br>
technological advances which would conceivably, provide new solutions for 
<br>
energy and resource needs. Maybe people will just be happily, downloaded, 
<br>
Greg Egan style. I am not sure of the later, not because I don't think it's 
<br>
achievable (I do!), but because it seems to scary because it (as of this 
<br>
point in time) because it's untried; like aviation was during the early 20th 
<br>
century.

&lt;&lt; Second, stating that the Singularity will end such problems forever, with
<br>
&nbsp;such certainty, is sort of silly in my view.  We really don't know how long
<br>
&nbsp;a Singularity will take to come about, or what its actual effects will be.
<br>
&nbsp;Maybe it will take 30 years to create the Singularity, in which case a hell
<br>
&nbsp;of a lot of good can be done by educating the poor now.  Maybe the
<br>
&nbsp;Singularity will result in a superintelligent computer that is fairly
<br>
&nbsp;indifferent to human problems, in which case it won't help the vast majority
<br>
&nbsp;of humans because it's spending all its time, say, solving math problems or
<br>
&nbsp;helping creatures in alternate universes. &gt;&gt;
