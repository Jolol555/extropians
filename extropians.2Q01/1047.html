<p>Gooood question Robert.  Ive heard reliable reports that the
<br>
commie rocket scientists are working for the equivalent of a
<br>
US dollar an hour, altho I still suspect at least some exaggeration
<br>
must be taking place.  Does anyone know?
<br>
<p>Im pretty sure Kistler did get some excellent commie engines
<br>
at firesale prices.   I dont know what their future availability
<br>
might be, however they look like a good bet for now
<br>
considering all our current options, which are few and grim
<br>
indeed.  Doug are you up to speed on Kistler?  spike
<br>
<p>PS I offer a huuuuuge apology to the entire list for posting
<br>
my wacky notion that the shuttle main engines were derived
<br>
from the SaturnV.  That was incorrect info that had been
<br>
lodged in my brain for I dont know how long, but about
<br>
3 seconds of actual pondering would have made me realize
<br>
theres noooo waaaay, for a lotta reasons: the size isnt right, the
<br>
atmospheric pressure profile isnt the same, the SSME
<br>
is a many-start; oh dear, oh my, I am shamed.  Moral
<br>
of the story, for propulsion questions talk to Doug Jones,
<br>
as hes actually in the biz, whereas Im over on the payload
<br>
side.  {8-[   &lt;----  blushing spike
<br>
<p>Im still good for prime number discovery predictions tho.  {8^D
