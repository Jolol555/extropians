</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We shouldn't be disgusted and frightened: rejection of change is a 
<br>
perfectly normal human reaction, and it would be astonishing (and
<br>
disturbing) if nobody reacted that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After all these years that we have been talking about these ideas to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disbelieving world, here is a group that really gets it, that actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes us.  They believe in biotech, in nanotech, in computers and AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and human-machine melding.  The believe that it can utterly reshape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only problem is, they hate the idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But still, to have a group believe, even though they are opposed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is worth something.  At least its a reaction.  Opposition is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than apathy.  
</em><br>
<p>And here's another thought: we need critics.
<br>
<p>It is generally a bad idea for new technologies to be adopted in a spirit
<br>
of uncritical optimism, without anyone keeping a weather eye open for 
<br>
hazards and problems. I know these campaigners are anti-everything, and
<br>
for that matter probably *too* critical to serve as useful critics, but
<br>
I get worried sometimes when, reading this list, I see nothing but 
<br>
optimism about the future. It makes me wonder if we haven't failed to
<br>
spot something bad.
<br>
<p>Final point: in making comments about the awfulness of using
<br>
nanotechnology to clear up pollution, the most extreme anti-technology
<br>
types will be undermining their own public support. I'd expect the *real*
<br>
debate to be more moderate than what was reported here, once it gets
<br>
under way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the end they will be forced to adopt a more nuanced position,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepting some technologies while questioning others.  This will lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to less stridency and hopefully allow for a more open dialog.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need to have a discussion, a global conversation about where we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going and what we will do when we get there.  Turning Joe Sixpack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soccer hooligans into immortal beings of pure energy isn't going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen overnight.  The sooner we get started talking together, the better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>Yup.
