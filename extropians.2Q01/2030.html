</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may be right, Anders.  However, I find people on this list too eager to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jump to that conclusion.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, isn't this list exactly the kind of meaning-sharing community as I 
<br>
described? Just because we are right and moral :-) doesn't mean that this 
<br>
list can avoid the trap of rejecting opposing ideas without considering them 
<br>
properly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the most difficult things for a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellect to do is to discuss opposing viewpoints as if they are valid or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real.  The first instinct is too assume that the self is right and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other is wrong.  Then natural next step is to assume the other must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid or lying about their position.  Either way, it becomes deceptively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy to dismiss the other position as not worthy of negotiation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is hard to believe, but I have found that almost everybody really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes in what they are doing.  Even insane people rarely act randomly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but are actually reacting quite rationally to their distorted perceptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, people get caught up in politics, enjoy a good fight, and become more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned with their ego than their goal.  We sometimes have that problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here on this list.
</em><br>
<p>If more people understood this, discussions would be much easier. But it 
<br>
takes time to train, and it is hard to get rid of ingrained knee-jerk 
<br>
defenses of one's view, whatever group (real or imagined) one belongs to or 
<br>
one's conception of how the world is. 
<br>
<p>I agree with your post, with the possible exception of saying that animal 
<br>
testing is evil. I prefer to view it as an ethically undesirable act in most 
<br>
cases rather than to equate it with anti-value.
