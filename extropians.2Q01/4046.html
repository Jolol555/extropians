<p>: For example, consider two astronomers who disagree about whether the
<br>
: universe is open (and infinite) or closed (and finite). Assume that they
<br>
: are both aware of the relevant cosmological data, and consider themselves
<br>
: Bayesians, and so they want to attribute their differences of opinion
<br>
: to differing priors about the size of the universe. Assume that these
<br>
: astronomers also both accept that their beliefs are encoded in neuronal
<br>
: structures, that their initial beliefs were determined largely by the
<br>
: expression of genes inherited from their parents, and that those genes
<br>
: were the result of a long evolutionary selection process. Finally, let
<br>
: one of them believe that nature was equally likely to have switched the
<br>
: assignment of their priors, so that the person with the open-favoring
<br>
: prior instead had the closed-favoring prior and vice versa.
<br>
<p>Counterfactuals are often trickier than they look.  Hofstadter has some
<br>
fun with this in GEB, as when you drive through a swarm of bees and think
<br>
&quot;good thing they weren't made of cement.&quot;
<br>
<p>But they get even trickier when you try to imagine who &quot;you&quot; are in a
<br>
world with a different history.  What if I were that poor orphan I see
<br>
in Bombay?  Who was I in ancient Egypt?
<br>
<p>I'm not sure these questions make sense.  I can conceive in principle of
<br>
estimating a probability of a given objective world, one in which there
<br>
is an individual with particular characteristics (perhaps similar to mine)
<br>
as an orphan in Bombay, or living in ancient Egypt.
<br>
<p>But I don't think it would make sense to say then that that person was
<br>
*me*, in the way we usually think of identity.
<br>
<p>In the context of this paper, what does it mean to say that I might
<br>
have had different priors, or that your priors and mine might have been
<br>
reversed?  To some extent, my priors *are* me.  Or at least, they are
<br>
the seed which grows into me.  Change these and the resulting person
<br>
would not be me.  Maybe he'd be you, maybe he'd be a new person entirely.
<br>
<p>I don't see how an agent can give a meaningful estimate of the probability
<br>
that *he* might have been given different priors.  If you swap his
<br>
priors with someone else, you don't thereby give him different priors.
<br>
Identity goes with the priors, plus the experiences.  If you swap the
<br>
priors but don't swap the experiences, you've created two new people.
<br>
If you swap priors + experiences, you've simply relabeled the existing
<br>
world and haven't really done anything meaningful.
<br>
<p>No doubt other people have different philosophical views about the
<br>
nature of identity where swapping priors makes sense.  But I think the
<br>
paper needs to address this issue head-on rather than talk of swapping
<br>
priors as though it were a philsophically unproblematic counterfactual.
<br>
(Of course, that's assuming that I didn't miss the point entirely.)
