<p>Oh. So you *were* making the equation TRUTH = PUBLICLY ADJUDICABLE AND
<br>
FALSIFIABLE CLAIM. That's such a non-starter (or so it seems to many) that
<br>
I'm a bit taken aback.
<br>
<p>JFK was shot and died, beyond question (unless we call up some absurd
<br>
conspiracy theory). Some account of how his death occurred is therefore
<br>
true, even if it hasn't yet been uttered. There is a truth of the matter,
<br>
known to those who were involved; there would be even if *nobody* knew
<br>
(perhaps a gun went off by accident in an empty room and the bullet
<br>
ricocheted, or he was killed by several micrometeorite fragments). In the
<br>
absence of testimony from the killer or killers, or a working time machine,
<br>
there is no way to adjudicate the contesting accounts with finality. Can
<br>
science tell us who killed JFK? Is it competent to tell us if Moses or
<br>
Jesus even lived? No. Can religious prophetic revelation? Hell no (but
<br>
that's beside the point just now). Is there a matter of truth involved in
<br>
such cases? Well, one would *suppose* so...
<br>
<p>However:
<br>
<p>It's intensely frustrating trying to conduct a discussion on a topic of
<br>
this kind by swapping one-liners or three-paragraphers without invoking
<br>
Kripke, Putnam (who started as a ferocious realist and became an
<br>
anti-realist), Dummett, Ruse and any number of other current philosophers.
<br>
It'd be as silly to try as it would be to discuss the plausibility of
<br>
molecular nanotechnology without citing (after carefully reading) Drexler,
<br>
Merkle, Freitas, Smalley, etc etc.
