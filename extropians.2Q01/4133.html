<em>&gt; &gt; The real story of technology in China is more chilling (and much more scary)

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're right that the Mongol conquest was likely the catalytic event that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sent China into an introspective and deep conservatism.  However, the seeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Confucian orthodoxy were already there.  It only took the humbling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of conquest by the western barbarians to cause the phase-change of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ossification that locked China into almost a thousand years of stasis.
</em><br>
<p>Robert Wright discusses this event in _Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny_
<br>
(2000), in Chapter 12 &quot;The Inscrutable Orient&quot; (pp. 162-164):
<br>
<p>&quot;The impetus behind [globalization] is strong largely because individual
<br>
states see that their long-term interest lies in plugging into the system...
<br>
China, of all nations, should know.  Its epic mistake -- the mistake that
<br>
got it labeled an underachiever -- was unplugging from the system beginning
<br>
in the late fourteenth century.  The consequences of this, a single political
<br>
decision, have ever since been taken as final proof of some deep
<br>
anti-modern streak in the Asian character.
<br>
<p>CHINA CHICKENS OUT
<br>
<p>The unplugging came during the Ming dynasty, which reigned from 1368 to
<br>
1644.  When the Ming vanquished the Mongols, it was in theory a
<br>
glorious moment for China: renewed native control after a century of
<br>
barbarian rule...  
<br>
<p>The irony of this isolationism is that during the early Ming period
<br>
the Chinese were king of the sea...
<br>
<p>The reasons for China's withdrawal are much debated...  The historian
<br>
John King Fairbank concluded simply that &quot;anti-commercialism and
<br>
xenophobia won, and China retired from the world scene.&quot;  Others
<br>
discern a more rational move.  The historian Peter Perdue sees China
<br>
consciously shifting resources from one vast project -- ocean voyages
<br>
that had shown little profit -- to another vast project:  building
<br>
the Great Wall to keep barbarians at bay.  In this view, the move
<br>
was neither mindlessly xenophobic (centuries of barbarian rampages
<br>
were no figment of China's imagination) nor anti-modern (the Great
<br>
Wall was high-tech back then).
<br>
<p>Whatever the cause for China's withdrawal, the timing was bad.
<br>
For centuries, China had been a big exporter of good ideas, and
<br>
western Europe a big importer.  Now, just as Europe's social brain was
<br>
really humming, China opted out of the exchange.
<br>
<p>The timing was bad in a second sense, too.  Over the next half-
<br>
century, European nations would embrace sailing big-time, and
<br>
find the New World.  Some scholars believe this stroke of fortune
<br>
explains why the industrial revolution happened where it did...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Interestingly, a similar phenomenon happened with Islamic culture.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conquest of the Islamic heartland by Genghis and his progeny also caused a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premature closure of the Islamic world to new ideas from outside and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation within their own cultural realm.
</em><br>
<p>What a delightful opportunity.  Genghis Khan and his honey:
