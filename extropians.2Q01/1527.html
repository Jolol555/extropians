genetic testing will tell sometime soon.

<p>The point I was, perhaps unsuccessfully, trying to make is that
<br>
when the theories get to the point that you have to scratch this
<br>
universe and/or create a new one to run the experiment, the pursuit
<br>
of TOE(s) gets rather pointless precisely because you can't test them.
<br>
(I assume that even as 'gods' we don't get to create universes --
<br>
though we do get to take this one 'to the limits' (which is very very
<br>
far indeed)).
<br>
<p>Cool though that you are doing dissertations on areas like this and
<br>
presenting them to academics less aware of the ideas.
<br>
<p>As Max would say -- Onward!
