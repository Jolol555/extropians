Hi James,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're willing, would talk a little bit about how you came to your
<br>
political beliefs?  How have they changed over time?  For
<br>
example, were you raised in a politically active family?  What books have been
<br>
most influential for you?
<br>
<p>What beliefs, if any, have you modified as a result of participating on this
<br>
list?
<br>
<p>For example, in my case, I was quite hostile towards unions in college.
<br>
After graduating, I worked as a CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant) in a nursing
<br>
home for a brief time  while I decided what I wanted to do next.  The nursing
<br>
home was chronically understaffed, and turnover was probably 100%/year.
<br>
Working as a nursing assistant in a nursing home is hard, dirty, physical
<br>
labor.  You run from room to room, lifting 100 - 250 lb patients to and from
<br>
the commode, dressing them, cleaning up if they have an accident, wheeling them
<br>
to/from the dining room.    No matter how fast you work, you can rarely stop,
<br>
because just as you finish with one patient, the call light for two more
<br>
patients goes off.  At times the patients suffered from poor care because of
<br>
the lack of staff.  However, most of the patients were not mentally competent,
<br>
so they couldn't complain.  The patient's  families were there for only brief
<br>
periods of time (if at all),  so they were largely unaware of the problems.
<br>
In my opinion, the biggest problems were a) too little pay b) too few CNA's.
<br>
If an individual CNA complained, then they could simply be fired.  The more I
<br>
worked there, the more attractive unions seemed.
<br>
<p><p>Chris
