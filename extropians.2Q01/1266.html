</em><br>
<p>sorry, i missed one.  so there are four that i know of:
<br>
ext3 - extension of ext2 and backwards compatible with it so probably the one
<br>
people will most likely adopt, with all the associated advantages and
<br>
disadvantages of ext2.
<br>
reiserfs - journaling filesystem specialising in high speed and efficient access
<br>
to lots of little files
<br>
jfs - ibm's journaling fs
<br>
xfs - sgi's journaling fs
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>i don't think it was ever an issue of wether it could be done, but the fact that
<br>
linus didn't want it in the kernel (i'm ignorant of the reasons of why he gave
<br>
in, or the reasons for the original resistance (apart from the fact that it
<br>
didn't fit the nice &quot;everything over the VFS&quot; scheme)) but i think the patch
<br>
existed for a long time before it was taken up so you could say that linux has
<br>
had raw device support for at least a couple of years.
<br>
<p>Also, any RDBM vendor that felt like having raw access could have distributed a
<br>
kernel module with their product giving them raw access to the devices they
<br>
required.  Probably not a major task for an RDBM developer.
