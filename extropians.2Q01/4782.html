<p>
There are two kinds of meaning.  (The chapter &quot;The Location
<br>
of Meaning&quot; was my favorite in Godel, Escher, Bach.) One
<br>
is *conventional* meaning.  For example, the five letters
<br>
&quot;zebra&quot; by convention denote a large striped animal.  Other
<br>
some meanings, however, are *isomorphic*.  For example, some
<br>
words attempt to imitate the sound of some physical phenomenon,
<br>
such as &quot;whoosh&quot;.  More importantly, some maps are so
<br>
detailed that they explicitly denote some object or
<br>
relationship in the real world.
<br>
<p>This last claim is very controversial, and it really requires
<br>
an excursion into evolutionary epistemology to properly
<br>
substantiate it.  But it can be looked upon as very obvious,
<br>
with the help of an example.
<br>
<p>Suppose some awful plague wiped out humankind and all
<br>
the higher animals.  Aliens land eventually, and in a
<br>
certain ruined city they come across an immense scale
<br>
model of the Mississippi river valley.  At first they
<br>
don't know what to make of the structure, but finally
<br>
one of them breaks the code.  He finds that for each
<br>
tributary depicted on the map, there is an actual tributary
<br>
of a large river system in the eastern half of the North
<br>
American continent.  At first, this student thinks it's
<br>
coincidence, but eventually can not but help to believe
<br>
that he's discovered something objectively true of the
<br>
universe: namely that this object and the Mississippi have
<br>
a real one-to-one relationship.  Here is the clincher:  any
<br>
other piece of intelligent apparatus in the universe will
<br>
make the same discovery (or it's not very intelligent).
<br>
<p>Sometimes meaning is conventional, sometimes it's isomorphic.
<br>
Those are the only two cases.
<br>
<p>My question:  what about an axiom system?  Are all the 
<br>
meanings (as in symbolic logic) only conventional?  How
<br>
does this relate to Godel's theorem?
<br>
<p>(Godel's theorem states that when a formal axiom system
<br>
is thought to be refering to number theory, there exist
<br>
true statements in that logical calculus (axiom system)
<br>
that have no demonstration within the axiom system. You
<br>
can see from my phrasing of the theorem the relevance of
<br>
my question.)
