JXTA (pronounced &quot;juxta&quot;, as in &quot;juxtaposition&quot;) is Bill Joy's new system
<br>
for promoting peer-to-peer application development.  It provides a base
<br>
for clients to locate other clients who are running the same application,
<br>
and some communication facilities.  See www.jxta.org.
<br>
<p>Bill Joy is of course well known to us here for his criticisms of working
<br>
on new technologies like AI and nanotech.  These technologies pose many
<br>
threats and Joy has proposed that we &quot;relinquish&quot; them, that is, that
<br>
we not develop them and meditate to achieve inner peace instead.
<br>
<p>Yet when I look at the JXTA proposal I see no facilities to support
<br>
relinquishment.  The system is presented purely as something which
<br>
can *facilitate* research and development.  JXTA could even be used
<br>
on projects which could promote nanotech and AI!
<br>
<p>Joy's positions are ultimately contradictory.  You can't consistently
<br>
provide tools for general technological development while calling
<br>
for society to restrict technological research.  If he wanted to be
<br>
consistent, he would have put facilities into JXTA to allow society to
<br>
limit its use.  Maybe there would have to be a majority vote among peers
<br>
before allowing a subset of them to run some particular software.
<br>
<p>Of course, building these kinds of roadblocks into JXTA would greatly
<br>
limit its chances for success.  It's hard enough to get people to try a
<br>
new technology without intentionally hampering it.  No one would want
<br>
to work on a project where others could easily pull the plug.  So of
<br>
course he didn't do it.
<br>
<p>Joy has thus put his personal and financial self-interest ahead of
<br>
his philosophical beliefs.  He has compartmentalized his mind so that
<br>
he can be the wise philosopher one day, raising cautionary notes about
<br>
technology, while he can be the profitable technologist the next, making
<br>
money for himself and his company (he is a major Sun stockholder).
<br>
<p>I'd like to see these contradictions made more obvious.  Wouldn't it
<br>
be great if there were a high-profile project to use Joy-the-engineer's
<br>
JXTA for exactly those technologies which give Joy-the-philosopher the
<br>
greatest concerns?  Let's see him get up and play pundit once he is
<br>
exposed as a hypocrite.
<br>
<p>Any suggestions for good projects along these lines?
<br>
<p>Hal
