Ok so if it is organoleptically detectable in ridiculously low 
<br>
concentrations, then what about not using human noses, what about electronic 
<br>
sniffer chips standardised, cheaply mass produced, and manditory by law, 
<br>
like smoke detectors?

<p>Easier said than done. The whole point of using methylmercaptane is that
<br>
it is organoleptically detectable in ridiculously low concentrations.
<br>
<p>More to the point, it is the standard additive to natural gas. You can
<br>
hence assume it as a design constant.

<p>May be, but how will you get people to use them?
