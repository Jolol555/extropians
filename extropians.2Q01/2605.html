Another version of the same story:
<br>
<p>Robot with living brain created in US
<br>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,474397,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,474397,00.html</a>

The Guardian
<br>
<p>Researchers in Chicago have built a cyborg, a half-living, half-robot creature
<br>
which connects the brain of an eel-like fish to a computer and is capable of
<br>
moving towards lights.
<br>
The device, developed at a research centre owned by Evanston's Northwestern
<br>
University, consists of the brain stem from the larva of a lamprey, a
<br>
bloodsucking fish, attached by electrodes to an off-the-shelf Swiss robot.
<br>
<p>In an arrangement reminiscent of the genesis of the Daleks, the living brain
<br>
floats in a container of cool, oxygenated salt fluid.
<br>
<p>Placed in the middle of a ring of lights, the robot's sensors detect when a
<br>
light is switched on. It sends signals to the lamprey brain, which returns
<br>
impulses instructing the robot to move on its wheels towards the light.
<br>
<p>When all the lights are off, the robot stays still. When one of the robot's
<br>
eyes is masked, the disembodied brain is temporarily confused, but learns to
<br>
compensate.
<br>
<p>One of the researchers, Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi, said the work was a step forward
<br>
in neural engineering. &quot;There's an element of uniqueness in what we've done,
<br>
particularly in the fact we've created a closed loop system, where the lamprey
<br>
brain and the robot are exchanging information,&quot; he told the Guardian.
<br>
<p>Scientists are exploiting the immature lamprey's instinct to keep itself
<br>
oriented the right way up in the water. In a cyborg arrangement, that
<br>
translates into seeking light.
<br>
<p>The marriage of baby bloodsucker and Swiss engineering has little chance of
<br>
conquering the universe as yet. Scientists can only keep the brains alive for
<br>
a few days and are unable to stabilise them long enough to see whether they
<br>
can remember anything.
<br>
<p>But they hope their work will ultimately lead to the creation of advanced,
<br>
brain-controlled prostheses for people whose normal ability to control their
<br>
limbs has been disrupted by a stroke or Parkinson's disease.
<br>
<p>&quot;The focus of our work is not so much to create a cyborg as to create a tool
<br>
for investigating the organisation of the brain,&quot; said Dr Mussa-Ivaldi.
<br>
<p>Other scientists are already moving towards the practical application of
<br>
microelectronics to help the disabled.
<br>
<p>In Atlanta, scientists have implanted a tiny glass electrode in the cerebral
<br>
cortex of a quadriplegic patient and coaxed neurons to grow inside. By
<br>
attaching a transmitter, the patient was able to move a cursor on a computer
<br>
screen by thought alone.
<br>
<p>The creation of the cyborg brings closer the advent of machines with animal
<br>
parts. Advances in miniaturised electronics have inspired other scientists to
<br>
try to develop devices with living biological components.
<br>
<p>The Washington Post reported that an Iowan entomologist, Tom Baker, has
<br>
attached moth antennae, capable of detecting the smell of high explosives, to
<br>
an electronic device which reads variations in the nerve signals sent out by
<br>
the antennae when they pick something up.
<br>
<p>But the electronics are not sophisticated enough to distinguish one smell from
<br>
another - so as yet the half-moth, half-chip machine isn't much use for its
<br>
intended purpose, sniffing out land mines.
<br>
<p>Dr Mussa-Ivaldi said cyborgs were, in a sense, already all around us. &quot;People
<br>
wearing prostheses could be considered cyborgs,&quot; he said. &quot;Some think that
<br>
when we're attached to our internet connections, we're cyborgs.&quot;
