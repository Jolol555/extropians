I suppose you meant &quot;imminent&quot; rather than immanent, didn't you?
<br>
I for one think that we are in a transition phase,
<br>
and that sooner or later, something that looks like
<br>
what some people here seem to call &quot;the Singularity&quot;
<br>
(emergence of some form of individual existence significantly
<br>
different from what the human race used to be) will happen.
<br>
I do think such &quot;Singularity&quot; is _immanent_ to the progress of mankind
<br>
(but I haven't RTFM'ed enough yet to have a good enough opinion
<br>
on what people here actually call the Singularity -- it's on my TODO list).
<br>
I don't think it is _imminent_ at all, though.
<br>
I don't expect it in my life time, except as a faint probability
<br>
in a few decades at the very least, if I help it well enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm curious whether anybody on this list takes actions that would be
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended primarily for financial gain.
</em><br>
This reminds me of an idea I had after some Jehovah's witness
<br>
told me the End of the World was near: next time I meet a JW,
<br>
I want to loan him money with a high interest, that he'd only start
<br>
paying me back after a few decades, way after the remotest date
<br>
he expects the end of the world to happen. Problems being:
<br>
(1) to convince the JW that he is not doing anything dishonest
<br>
&nbsp;accepting this deal, or betting money at all (maybe find some
<br>
&nbsp;non-monetary way of turning things, so he won't be frightened?)
<br>
(2) the JW actually being solvent and willing to pay when the time comes
<br>
&nbsp;to pay his debt.
<br>
(3) such a loan contract holding in court, rather than be cancelled as fraud.
<br>
<p>This now reminds me of Robin Hanson's obsession about putting betting markets
<br>
everywhere. How can we lower transaction costs so that it becomes possible
<br>
to actually bet on more and more topic?
