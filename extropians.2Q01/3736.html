<em>&gt; Well, I've been trying in my own incoherent way to spark discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about such issues and how they fit into a pattern of increasing ULE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imho replacing the gov't with luddites as extropian enemy number 1 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a brilliant move it's hard to believe it wasn't planted by some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence service. I didn't like em much when I started on this list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in many ways I wish the cypherpunks would come back.
</em><br>
<p>I think looking for an enemy number one is itself a dangerous meme - enemy 
<br>
number two can be nearly as dangerous and enemy number three will gladly team 
<br>
up with four, five and six...
<br>
<p>Today I think the big threat against personal freedom is not coming from a 
<br>
single traditional direction, but rather from two synergetic forces. The 
<br>
first is the apparently unlikely but actually quite coherent alliance between 
<br>
governments and various NGOs based in what Virginia Postrel called stasism: 
<br>
the idea that unregulated change is bad, and either should be prevented or 
<br>
regulated. This is why we are opposed by both conservatives and liberals (in 
<br>
the American sense). The second force is the ease many corporations and 
<br>
special interests groups can get laws enacted to safeguard their 
<br>
profitability or allow politicians to appear to do something about the latest 
<br>
moral panic, while the political system does not fully comprehend or study 
<br>
the implication of these laws. Hence abominations like the DMCA which seems 
<br>
to be spreading worldwide.
<br>
<p>The luddites in themselves are fairly harmless in this mess, they simply 
<br>
represent the reactionary green wing of the stasists and happily ally with 
<br>
technocratic stasists. The irony is of course that plenty of luddites hate 
<br>
large corporations (it is hard to love them) but they are really on the same, 
<br>
broad ideological side: change is bad, don't let people develop technology 
<br>
without supervision - but for different reasons, of course. That Microsoft 
<br>
doesn't like open source software is not really because they are evil, but 
<br>
simply because it doesn't fit their business model and it makes pragmatic 
<br>
sense to try to inhibit it. 
<br>
<p>Being a cryptoanarchist *and* transparent society fan, I think what we need 
<br>
is both to safeguard the freedom of writing and implementing code (and other 
<br>
technology) and to push for a more open society. We need to present a 
<br>
credible alternative to stasism, demonstrate why stasism doesn't work and 
<br>
develop new political tools to make the passing of stupid/dangerous laws less 
<br>
tempting.
