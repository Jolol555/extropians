Mathematics for its own sake has never been my
<br>
idea of a good time (though I'm not entirely innumerate
<br>
or math-phobic -- I manage to hold down a job as a computer
<br>
programmer after all!).  Therefore, while I've been dimly
<br>
aware of the hoopla surrounding chaos theory and complexity
<br>
theory in recent years, I haven't paid very much attention to
<br>
it (though I know a guy who's been utterly fascinated by the
<br>
Mandelbrot Set for years:
<br>
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~mrob/pub/muency.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~mrob/pub/muency.html</a> )
<br>
<p>However, the McCrone book (_Going Inside_) I've been reading
<br>
recently (Again with that book! When will he give it a rest! ;-&gt; )
<br>
makes a big deal about complexity theory as a new theoretical
<br>
framework for Darwinian evolutionary theory.  This has
<br>
caused me to be struck by analogy I hadn't really noticed before,
<br>
though I suppose it's one that many people probably find
<br>
obvious by now, including some folks on this list [*].
<br>
<p>In a post I made late last year about the book
<br>
_Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge_ by
<br>
Henry C. Plotkin (the post is in the archive's
<br>
blind spot at the moment; it'll be back on the shelf
<br>
when it comes back from the binder's ;-&gt; ), I quoted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; p. 171
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         A nested hierarchy of selectional processes is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         simple and elegant conception of the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>and
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [T]he following passage (from Chapter 7 &quot;The Philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Problems in Perspective&quot;, p. 243)... contains a capsule summary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Plotkin's view of the relationship between inter-organismic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and intra-organismic evolutionary processes (what are called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the book the primary and secondary heuristics):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Unable to rely upon just one level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         evolution and one unit of selection as the means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         gaining knowledge about just one range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         frequencies of change (that range being limited at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         one end by the change becoming undetectably slow to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         the point that survival is not threatened by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         failure to respond to it, and at the other by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         generational deadtime of each species), subsidiary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         evolutionary processes have evolved, each with its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         own units of selection, and each able to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         knowledge about changes that are occurring at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ever-higher frequencies.  So in the real world the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Humean uncertainty is converted into a pragmatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         issue of dividing the world into band widths of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         frequencies of change and fluctuation, and employing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         knowledge-gaining mechanisms that are able to match
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         the rates of perturbation of the world with organic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         structures able to alter their own states at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         equivalent rates.
</em><br>
<p>McCrone describes the same &quot;nested selectional hierarchy&quot;
<br>
in _Going Inside_, Chapter 12, &quot;Getting It Backwards&quot;
<br>
(pp. 268-269):
<br>
<p>&quot;As Gerald Edelman argued, the key to understanding the
<br>
brain is that it is plastic on all scales of organisation.
<br>
Each moment of processing is actually connected to a whole
<br>
continuum of selectionist pressures and evolutionary
<br>
adjustments.  Behind the events of the instant lie the
<br>
minute-by-minute adaptations in neurotransmitter levels,
<br>
the hour-by-hour sprouting of new memory connections, the
<br>
year-by-year changes of childhood development, and even
<br>
the generation-by-generation changes of the evolutionary
<br>
history of a species.  Information is being captured on
<br>
all these levels and, as said, the entire weight of
<br>
this information is brought to bear on the processing
<br>
of a moment.&quot;
<br>
<p>The analogy here, of course, is a view of the nested processes
<br>
of selection, with evolution as the outermost level and the
<br>
fleeting activation patterns of consciousness as the innermost,
<br>
as all parts of a unified fractal pattern spread out in time,
<br>
spanning timescales ranging from milliseconds to billions of
<br>
years, and broadly self-similar across all those scales.

<br>
<p>MILES:  Do I believe in God?  I'm what you
<br>
would call a teleological existential atheist.
<br>
I believe that there's an intelligence to the
<br>
universe, with the exception of certain parts of
<br>
New Jersey.

<p>LUNA:  Miles?  Miles, did you ever realize that
<br>
&quot;God&quot; spelled backwards is &quot;dog&quot;?
<br>
<p>MILES:  Yeah, so?
<br>
<p>LUNA:  Makes you think!
<br>
<p>MILES:  Yeah... wanna push the car, please?
<br>
G.. go push the car, will ya?  &lt;dramatic eye roll&gt;
