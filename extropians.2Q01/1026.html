<p>Eliezer, by this statement I would conclude that you feel the
<br>
Morovecian scenario of having the robots run simulations of
<br>
themselves gives those robots no rights to &quot;take back&quot; the
<br>
&quot;mutations&quot; implemented in the 'sims if the 'sims do not grant
<br>
permission for this (assuming the robots are self-conscious).
<br>
<p>Or does &quot;creation&quot; grant you complete &quot;mind tapping&quot; rights
<br>
but no &quot;directorship&quot; rights?
<br>
<p>Another way of putting this is you develop the mutations,
<br>
run the mutations forward to see if they are successful
<br>
but then have to &quot;ask permission&quot; to access the results
<br>
of the sim to transfer it back to the basement level.
<br>
<p>If that's the way it works, you will not find me programming
<br>
&quot;conscious&quot; beings.  We will all be developing entities
<br>
that look like consciousness, walk like consciousness and
<br>
talk like consciousness but are not consciousness under the
<br>
legal definitions (or SysOp interpretations) of consciousness.
<br>
<p>[There are interesting parallels here with current animal rights
<br>
movements that if carried to their logical end put a serious
<br>
crimp in scientific exploration (or extropic creation in the
<br>
future).]
<br>
<p>It also suggests that from Eliezer's perspective consciousness
<br>
is a binary state -- there are no shades of gray that have greater
<br>
or lesser self-determination rights (which certainly isn't the case
<br>
if you look at the legal system in the world today where you
<br>
have all kinds of conditions where 'guardians' may control
<br>
what happens to other conscious beings.
<br>
<p>Certainly makes for an interesting game.
<br>
