Robert Bradbury said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I believe a recent paper in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Science has completely disproven the classical 'Penrosian'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perspective in this area because the 'noise' in the mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;far exceeds the quantum mechanical effects.
</em><br>
<p>The article in question (Science, Feb. 4, 2000, 287,
<br>
No. 5454, p791) reports on a paper by Max Tegmark
<br>
(quant-ph/9907009) which I mentioned in my original message:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is a well-known paper (<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9907009">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9907009</a>) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguing that mesoscopic quantum states would rapidly decohere under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological conditions; there is another paper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0007020">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0007020</a>) arguing that the first paper's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument does not apply to quantum-*field* effects.
</em><br>
<p>The second paper uses the same formulae to calculate
<br>
decoherence times for ionic crystals like table salt,
<br>
of the order of 10^-37 seconds:
<br>
<p>&quot;According to [these calculations], due to the very
<br>
short decoherence time, the considered crystals are
<br>
not QM systems: They do not exist as stable quantum
<br>
systems. Then one could naively conclude that they
<br>
are systems ruled by classical mechanics. Of course,
<br>
such a conclusion is wrong: It contradicts the
<br>
well known and experimentally well tested QFT
<br>
description of the crystals...&quot;
<br>
<p>and later:
<br>
<p>&quot;...as shown above, the origin of the high stability
<br>
of macroscopic quantum systems cannot be in the
<br>
QM superposition mechanism. It is in the coherent
<br>
condensation in the ground state of long range
<br>
correlation modes ... [in the case of crystals,
<br>
phonons]&quot;
<br>
<p>I mailed Tegmark about this paper a week ago, asking
<br>
for his opinion, so I'm hoping to hear back soon.
<br>
<p>There's also a reply to Tegmark's paper (quant-ph/0005025)
<br>
which is being reviewed at Phys Rev E right now.
<br>
The issue is far from settled.
<br>
<p>Robert again:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Until you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;come up with some premise for aspects of the 'mind' that ARE *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explained by Calvin's Darwinian mating/copying/selection perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then, may we *please* presume that normal physics is completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient without having to delve into the QM realm?
</em><br>
<p>As I said in my last message, I don't think QM by itself
<br>
can explain the mind any more than classical physics does,
<br>
but (again, thanks to nonseparability) it is much friendlier
<br>
to straightforward realism about the unity of consciousness
<br>
than emergent-computationalist approaches like Daniel
<br>
Dennett's, which regards the self as an illusion or fiction,
<br>
a 'narrative center of gravity'.
