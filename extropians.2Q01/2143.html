How many descriptions of the Singularity do we wish to submit to this
<br>

<p>
Thank you for entering last year's Shell and The Economist writing competition. Now's your chance to enter this year's prestigious event and have your opinions printed in one of the world's most highly respected publications. 
<br>
<p>The subject for 2001 is 'Going Faster - but where?' 
<br>
<p>Take a look around you - the population is going places. And there are countless issues that the world faces in the light of increasing mobility and transport developments. Is LPG the way forward? Should we pedestrianise inner cities? How is tourism effecting the environment? We want to hear your views. 
<br>
<p>This is your opportunity to join the elite ranks of writers published in our special annual publication: The Economist - The World in 2002. All eight finalists will feature in an announcement and the winner will see their essay in print. And there is also a first prize of $20,000.
<br>
<p>So get in the driving seat and head for www.goingfasterbutwhere.com for further details. 
<br>
<p>Shell.
