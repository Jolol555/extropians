<p>It's weirder than that for me. Here's how it works, as I mentioned to
<br>
Robert (and bear in mind that when I was growing up my name was so
<br>
incredibly rare &amp; absurd that not a day passed without my head being shoved
<br>
down the lavatory for it):
<br>
<p>&quot;Damien Broderick&quot; + Australia + &quot;popular science&quot; + journalism +
<br>
&quot;Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot; + &quot;Science Show&quot; + PhD, or some such
<br>
improbable concatenation, will pick out... 
<br>
<p>*two entirely different and unrelated people*. 
<br>
<p>Me, and a guy 20 years or so younger, who's a zoologist at University of
<br>
Queensland and broadcasts occasional pop sci pieces on ABC radio (more
<br>
frequently than I do, in fact)... 
<br>
<p>This actually irritates me no end, since I got into print while he was
<br>
still in nappies or the womb; I think he should rename himself D. Fortesque
<br>
Broderick (or whatever). Hmm... come to think of it, maybe *I* will...
<br>
<p>Damien

[Harlan Ellison wouldn't stand still for it, I can tell you that]

[Isaac Asimov would have *kicked his butt*]
