</em><br>
<p>Thanks, Mark.  I wish that my responses were instrumental in
<br>
advancing that cause.  But I'm quite far behind many I know,
<br>
of whom, it's inconceivable that they would ever have been
<br>
found engaging in the excesses that so mar our exchanges, e.g.,
<br>
flame wars.  Somehow, one wants to be able to model the mindset
<br>
of an individual who will read everything that one writes in the
<br>
worst possible light.  That doesn't sound generous; but I'm
<br>
afraid that it's true---at least true of vastly more of us than
<br>
one would have thought.
<br>
<p>When I wrote condescendingly, &quot;The flaw in your argument is ...&quot;,
<br>
I was translating from what would have happened had we been discussing
<br>
the problem over, say, dinner.  Listening to your explanation, I
<br>
might have suddenly said, &quot;Ah, but what's wrong with that is...&quot;,
<br>
and given my tone of voice and general demeanor, it's certain that
<br>
you wouldn't have been bothered for an instant.  But (as has been
<br>
pointed out so many times) all those signals are absent in email,
<br>
and I guess that one must merely try harder to rephrase so as to
<br>
make one's actual attitude clear.  Maybe there can be a list of
<br>
phrases to avoid:
<br>
<p>1.  &quot;The flaw in your argument...&quot;
<br>
<p>2.  &quot;Perhaps you've noticed...&quot; (when it's something the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person probably already knows)
<br>
<p>3.  &quot;That's a common misperception...&quot; (about what someone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just wrote)
<br>
<p>4.  &quot;*We* believe that ...&quot; (when the speaker could possibly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be read as belonging to an elite)
<br>
<p>5.  &quot;I used to think that too.&quot;
<br>
<p>and there are probably many more that can be found examining some
<br>
email exchanges.
<br>
<p>But the cause may be hopeless.  Look again at my first sentence:
<br>
&quot;Thanks, Mark.  I wish that my responses were instrumental in...&quot;
<br>
<p>Why, there's even a hidden implication there that *Mark's* input
<br>
was not!  So as a practical measure, one simply must learn not to
<br>
react.  Somehow.
<br>
