<em>&gt; The beginning may be familiar to some, but the addendum could be a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ever Wonder Why?...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US standard railroad gauge (width between the two rails) is 4 feet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8.5 inches. That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in England, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US railroads were built by English expatriates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why did the English build them like that? Because the first rail lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tramways, and that's the gauge they used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why did &quot;they&quot; use that gauge then? Because the people who built the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building wagons which used that wheel spacing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing? Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's the spacing of the wheel ruts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So who built those old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe (and England) were built by Imperial Rome for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legions. The roads have been used ever since.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the ruts in the roads? Roman war chariots first formed the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were made for (or by) Imperial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the original specification for an Imperial Roman war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chariot. Specifications and bureaucracies live forever. So the next time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind came up with it, you may be exactly right, because the Imperial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roman war chariots were made just wide enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accommodate the back ends of two war horses. Thus, we have the answer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now the extra-terrestrial twist to the story...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When we see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; booster rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tank. These are solid rocket boosters, or SRBs. The SRBs are made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thiokol at their factory in Utah. The engineers who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed the SRBs might have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SRBs had to be shipped by train from the factory to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch site.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The railroad line from the factory had to run through a tunnel in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mountains. The SRBs had to fit through that tunnel. The tunnel is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly wider than the railroad track, and the railroad track is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as wide as two horses' behinds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, the major design feature of what is arguably the world's most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced transportation system was determined over two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand years ago by the width of a horse's behind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you wonder why it's so hard to get ahead in this world...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
