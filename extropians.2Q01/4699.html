<p>This is something Ive pondered often since I read my great grandmother's
<br>
diary.  She wrote entries nearly every day, but what caught my eye was
<br>
an entry she made in on 24 October 1929, since it did not mention the
<br>
stock market crash.  The collapse was in a sense a social microsingularity,
<br>
in that everything changed on that day.
<br>
<p>Repercussions from that event would ripple thru the world leaving no
<br>
one untouched, but my great grandmother, who was raising her children
<br>
and helping run a farm, did not mention it then or in any of the following
<br>
several weeks.  The news gradually filtered down that something really
<br>
bad had happened, and that prices would be hurt (lowered).
<br>
<p>We discuss the AI version of the Singularity, yet much of this world
<br>
still has never even seen a computer, and at least at the time would
<br>
fail to notice if an AI, friendly or otherwise, suddenly took over
<br>
everything.  spike
