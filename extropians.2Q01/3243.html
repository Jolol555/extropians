<p><em>&gt;&gt;It wasn't technology that doomed the first SST's it was politics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;specifically noise and pollution.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Noise, pollution and sonic booms are valid concerns but what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really doomed it is economics, nobody could figure out how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make money off a SST because only an elite few would be willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to spent 3 or 4 times as much a flight just to save an hour or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two. But build a cheap one and they will come.
</em><br>
<p>I'll admit it's a possibility, especially since Americans in
<br>
general are seasoned airtravelers with considerably more money to
<br>
spend (I realize that point's debateable). I didn't detect anything
<br>
in the article to indicate cheapness, in fact it looked more
<br>
elitist than ever.
<br>
<p>The other problem is the omnipresent NIMBYism present in american
<br>
society today. I live under a flight path to O'Hare airport and am
<br>
accustomed to the noise, yet I am surrounded by people who knew
<br>
that when they moved here, bitch constantly about the noise, and
<br>
are determined to try and control the airport. If these things are
<br>
one decibel louder than a current jet, expect massive opposition.
<br>
At the very least they could be excluded to over water flights.
