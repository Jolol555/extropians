<br>
<p>Right now we are organizing as RAGE in Asheville, and other local groups in 
<br>
the region are welcome to start up and start communicating through this new

<p>A RAGE meeting took place at the regional Earth First! gathering in east 
<br>
Tennessee. Plans for a SPRING ACTION are underway. Get in touch if it sounds 
<br>
interesting! Southrage folks will be at the Y-12 protest in Knoxville (April 
<br>
8) if you want to talk in person, as well as the Atlanta FTAA solidarity 
<br>
action on April 21.
<br>
<p>We're also looking to travel around the region and speak with activists, 
<br>
students, farmers, etc..to mobilize for the spring action, and to get this 
<br>
issue out in the public eye in the southeast. Please get in touch if you can 
<br>
help bring us to your town.
<br>
<p>Please forward this notice to regional activist lists
<br>
and anybody you think may be interested.
<br>
<p>Long live the seed!!
