<p><em>&gt;But with the islands case, you have some species adapted to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific niche where there are no competitors and the incoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;species are those from the larger continents where they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had to compete and survive.  They generally come in with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better &quot;genes&quot; and that is why they win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The proper comparison given your example is species coming into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an island just after it has been formed when there is no established
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ecosystem to take advantage of.  In that situation the &quot;mainlanders&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't have an easy time of it.  Only a very limited set of species
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that have evolved to deal with the resource poor conditions manage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make a go of it.
</em><br>
<p>If there's life on Europa, there *is* an ecosystem.  So we're back to
<br>
invading existing niches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Given the low energy availability you cite on Europa, the species
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from Earth that would manage to compete effectively are probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;few and far between.  The scientific insights that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be derived from any species that were discovered growing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such an environment would likely be very great.  Nothing like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a few billion years of evolution under really poor conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make you tougher than steel...
</em><br>
<p>There are bacteria that catalyze almost any reaction of organics
<br>
you can find.  Many can make a living under very restricted conditions.
<br>
Earth has lots of energy-poor environments.  The difference is 
<br>
Earth microbes have access to experimentation in the high-energy
<br>
enviroments via gene swapping, and then get polished by competition.
<br>
<p>I would agree there's an excellent chance that Europan life could have
<br>
some really great things to teach up about biochemistry; I agree there
<br>
will be some Europan environments with rare or poor Earth analogues.
<br>
It's precisely that reason I want to be very careful about protecting
<br>
any hypothetical Europan life from destructive Earth contamination.
<br>
If we were mining Europa, then there would be cost-benefit issues to
<br>
deal with; but right now, we're *only* looking at it as a possible place
<br>
for alternate life.  Europa isn't going anywhere; we can afford to make
<br>
sure we investigate it right.
