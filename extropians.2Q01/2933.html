<p>&quot;Highly nonlinear&quot; seems to be becoming the standard buzz-word for the

&quot;man was not meant to travel at more than sixty miles an hour&quot; crowd
<br>
these days. First he concedes that we *have* successfully mapped 300
<br>
neurone systems. He also concedes that scanning resolution adequate for
<br>
mapping a brain will probably become available. Then, having painted
<br>
himself into a corner, he insists that &quot;the brains of higher vertebrates
<br>
have fundamentally different system architectures than computers&quot; (which
<br>
is true -- hasn't he ever heard of simulation?) and then he appeals to
<br>
Mystic Properties of single neurons to save them from the grisly nightmare
<br>
fate of being mapped and uploaded.
<br>
<p>Sorry, I don't buy it. I think he's got a contrary agenda (that phrase,
<br>
&quot;nightmarish scenarios&quot;, is a dead giveaway) and he's trying to weasel
<br>
out of it. Next thing you know he'll be invoking Penrose's microtubules ...
