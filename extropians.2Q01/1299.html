<p>This looks to me like a classic example of Japanglish, which
<br>
has always been a source of great hilarity to native English
<br>
speakers -- see <a href="http://www2.gol.com/users/cmb/japang.html">http://www2.gol.com/users/cmb/japang.html</a>
<br>
(or just google on &quot;Japanglish&quot;).
<br>
<p>I guess it's a sign of the times that one-liners like these are
<br>
now coming out of gaming culture.  In my day it was TV
<br>
commercials (&quot;Where's the beef?&quot;, &quot;Parts is parts.&quot;,  [I kicked
<br>
myself for not sticking that one in at the end of the blurb
<br>
I posted the other day about the baaad movie _Parts: The Clonus Horror_],
<br>
&quot;It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken.&quot;),
<br>
TV shows (&quot;He's dead, Jim.&quot;) or even **books** (&quot;Consider it
<br>
evolution in action&quot; from Pournelle &amp; Niven's _Oath of Fealty_).
<br>
<p>Speaking of one-liners, I'll bet there are a number of folks
<br>
on this list who have heard of Nancy Lebovitz (I know that
<br>
Robin Hanson has, because she's mentioned in the acknowledgements
<br>
of his paper &quot;If Uploads Come First&quot;
<br>
( <a href="http://www.primitivism.com/uploads-dawn.htm">http://www.primitivism.com/uploads-dawn.htm</a> ).
<br>
I'm a little surprised, in fact, that she hasn't shown up on the
<br>
Extropians', but she's everywhere on rec.arts.sf-lovers (or I guess that's
<br>
rec.arts.sf.written, these days.  Anyway, if you know her you
<br>
know that she makes and sells calligraphic buttons (formerly at SF
<br>
conventions, where she has been a habituee for decades, and now
<br>
on the Web, <a href="http://www.nancybuttons.com/">http://www.nancybuttons.com/</a> ).
<br>
<p>I used to know Nancy in the flesh, circa 1975, when she used to hang out
<br>
around the Student Center at the University of Delaware playing her
<br>
recorder (the wooden flute kind, not the electronic kind).  When I bicycled
<br>
back to town from the lab technician job I had at DuPont Instruments,
<br>
I'd have dinner at Jimmy's Diner on Main Street in Newark, and she'd
<br>
often pop up around the same time.  I was into behaviorism then
<br>
(B. F. Skinner's _Beyond Freedom &amp; Dignity_, _Science and Human
<br>
Behavior_, and so on), from which she tried strongly to dissuade me.
<br>
I had checked out Skinner's _Verbal Behavior_ from the university
<br>
library, and she remonstrated with me &quot;Don't you know that's been totally
<br>
discredited?  What about Chomsky?&quot;.  &quot;Who's Chomsky?&quot; [blush].
<br>
Ah, well,  that was in a past life.
<br>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I feel a hot fit coming on ;-&gt; .
<br>
<p>(Not that) Jim
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When a passenger of the foot hove in view, tootle the horn;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trumpet at him melodiously at first, but if he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still obstacles your passage tootle him with vigor and express
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by word of mouth warning, 'Hi, Hi.'&quot;
