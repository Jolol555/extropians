Gene Therapy Restores Vision in Dog 
<br>
<p>By MALCOLM RITTER, AP Science Writer 
<br>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) - Using gene therapy, scientists have restored vision in
<br>
dogs with a version of a rare disease that blinds human infants. The 
<br>
work may lead to treatments for several genetic forms of blindness.
<br>
<p>The dogs had a version of Leber congenital amaurosis, an untreatable
<br>
condition that causes near total blindness in infancy. Perhaps 10,000 
<br>
Americans have it, and about 1,000 of them have the particular genetic 
<br>
defect corrected in the dogs, said researcher Dr. Jean Bennett.
<br>
<p>If the gene therapy works in Leber patients, it might pave the way for
<br>
treating a variety of hereditary vision diseases that strike the retina,
<br>
known collectively as retinitis pigmentosa, which affects 100,000 to 
<br>
200,000 Americans, said Dr. Gerald Chader, chief scientific officer of
<br>
the Foundation Fighting Blindness.
<br>
<p>``It should open the floodgates,'' said Chader, whose organization 
<br>
helped finance the research.
<br>
<p>Bennett, an associate professor of ophthalmology the University of
<br>
Pennsylvania, and colleagues report their experiments on three Briard 
<br>
dogs in the May issue of the journal Nature Genetics.
<br>
<p>She said she hopes initial experiments in people can begin within about
<br>
two years.
<br>
<p>The dogs were blind because they lacked a particular gene. Without it,
<br>
their eyes could not make a pigment necesssary to perceive light. The 
<br>
therapy was designed to deliver working copies of the gene to their 
<br>
eyes.
<br>
<p>Researchers used eye surgery to deliver a dose of the gene, carried by a
<br>
virus that deposited the gene within eye cells. They treated one eye in 
<br>
each animal and used the other eye for comparison.
<br>
<p>Four months after treatment, several tests showed the animals had
<br>
regained at least some sight in the treated eye. Most dramatically, the 
<br>
dogs were allowed to wander in a room cluttered with furniture. The dogs
<br>
were much better at avoiding objects on the same side of their bodies as
<br>
the treated eye than on the other side.
<br>
<p>The dogs also seemed to be using the treated eye to look around, Bennett
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Researchers also measured how much the dogs' pupils contracted in
<br>
response to light. The treated eyes showed a better response than 
<br>
untreated eyes did, although it was not as good as normal dog eyes show.
<br>
<p>The treatment's effects have lasted nine months so far, Bennett said.
