In discussing nanocomputer programming, I had said that they would
<br>
probably be programmed in assembly language.

<p>In large part.  You are going to be constrained on memory *and*
<br>
processing power.  You are going to want to do as much as possible
<br>
with as little as possible.  Nanobots have to be small (to go crawling
<br>
around inside cells).  That puts strong limits on things unless you
<br>
teleoperate them from larger 'bots in circulation.  But there
<br>
are limits on communication, interference from nearby 'bots, etc.
<br>
that make this problematic.  You may be heat density limited on the
<br>
number of 'bots you can operate at the site of an infection
<br>
(so they need to be as CPU cycle efficient as possible).
<br>
<p>In the 'real' world, you have similar problems -- if you want the
<br>
simulations to run as fast as possible, the nodes have to be as
<br>
close as possible and they have to generate as little heat
<br>
per unit work done as possible.  That means you don't want
<br>
'wasted' instructions in the execution stream.
