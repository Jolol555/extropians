<p>Having lost a cat of my own recently, under circumstances in which
<br>
experiments like this might have resulted in her still being alive, I
<br>
would have jumped at the opportunity to use her as a test subject for
<br>
this.  One could tell she was starting to hate life anyway as her
<br>
insides slowly gave out, so her dying this way would not have been much
<br>
worse than her dying naturally, for her or myself.  (It's a bit too
<br>
late to make that choice now, though.)
<br>
<p>But I may be an exception.  More to the point, though, this typically
<br>
is not done to Fido or Princess, but to lab animals specifically bred
<br>
for these experiments.  Consider mice: they can be as warm and cuddly
<br>
as any mammal their size, and are sometimes used as pets, yet they are
<br>
also the main food-devouring, disease-carrying (either in their blood
<br>
or in riders in their fur), house-damaging scourge in many areas and
<br>
eras of human history (case in point: the Black Plague).  So...should
<br>
one shed a tear for cyber-mice experiments?
