<p>As I mentioned in another message, strict supply and demand will not always
<br>
determine the market pricing.  As you point out IT people have been
<br>
directly or indirectly eliminating jobs in other professions for years
<br>
(for example speech recognition has certainly cut the number of
<br>
directory assistance operators telephone companies have had to
<br>
employ).  The IT people can charge very high rates if their output
<br>
results in productivity gains and lower overall costs for the company.
<br>
<p>Its unlikely that foreigners would know many businesses sufficiently
<br>
that they would be able to see these opportunities sufficiently to
<br>
sell these ideas and themselves.  However combinations of 'developed'
<br>
country sales people &amp; managers with foreign/offshore workers
<br>
could work effectively (as Emlyn points out).  Probably this is the
<br>
IT the equivalent of moving the 'manufacturing' industries to places
<br>
like Mexico or Taiwan.
<br>
<p>The only way to deal with this is to move into new industries as
<br>
rapidly as they develop.  For example Rob Freitas and I were
<br>
discussing the other day how nanobot programmers are going to
<br>
have to do most of their work in 'assembly' language.  That
<br>
means all you JAVA and Python programmers are going to have
<br>
to retrain.  Now, old folks like me who actually speak half a
<br>
dozen assembly languages, we will be able to name our price... :-)
