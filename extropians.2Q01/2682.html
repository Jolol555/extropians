It appears as if Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@ricochet.net?Subject=Re:%20Anti-Capitalism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104190857.KAA12724@color.sics.se&gt;">lcorbin@ricochet.net</a>&gt; wrote:

<p>People who asserted views against freedom of personal ownership

appeared on the Extropians mailing list late - only in the last few

<br>
<p>The 1996 list had a number of people believing in PPL and related
<br>
topics, and very few interested in the main- stream political factions
<br>
of the day, discussions of which today infest the list ad nauseam. A
<br>
number of people on the 1996 list appeared to expect, or at least hope
<br>
for, the imminent elimination of government altogether (right-wing
<br>
anarchism).
<br>
<p>Socialists use force to remove their opponents' power base.
<br>
Anarchists use cooperation to remove their opponents' power base.
<br>
<p>Many, who previously called themselves Communists or Socialists, have
<br>
started calling themselves Anarchists after the fall of Communism.
<br>
<p>Many Socialists have used this agitprop method to take over a competing
<br>
group in the past with success, among them the Bolsheviks. Such &quot;anarchists&quot;
<br>
state that right-wing Anarchism, esp. anarchocapitalism, &quot;is&quot; not true
<br>
Anarchism. I rest my case.
