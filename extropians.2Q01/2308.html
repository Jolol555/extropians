<p>Wait a minute Brian.  Your comment suggests that moderns have
<br>
a less stressful physical environment but perhaps a more stressful
<br>
mental environment.  (I think thats what you were going for.)  Perhaps
<br>
we vastly underestimate the mental stressfulness of bygone eras,
<br>
when many or perhaps most people were farmers.  If you get to know
<br>
farmers, you soon recognize that their environment is as stressful
<br>
if not more so than their urban counterparts, for they face constant
<br>
risk of financial ruin from bad weather, political events over which
<br>
they have no control, market forces, etc.  They bet the farm every
<br>
year on their crops.  This on top of pretty much constant physical
<br>
danger for every family member.  We city types have it made, in
<br>
the stress category.
<br>
<p>So your original point may stand without the parenthetic qualifier,
<br>
and is one Ive suspected for a long time.  A few germs are good
<br>
for the immune system, a little radiation may be good for the
<br>
body and a little stress may be good for the mind.  spike
