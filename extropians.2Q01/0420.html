<p>I strongly doubt it will require an SI.  Lets assume ten million species
<br>
(10^7) each with an average genome of 10 gigabases (10^10).  (A few are
<br>
much bigger, most are much smaller.  So you have to work with ~10^17 * 2 / 8
<br>
bytes of information.  That is *way* less than the number of atoms in a mole.
<br>
Aggregate computing capacity on the planet currently is probably circa 10^25
<br>
Ops per year and most of that is heavily underutilized.
<br>
<p>It isn't the case that you have to compare *everything* with *everything* else.
<br>
You can select a few dozen or a few hundred candidate genes, highly conserved
<br>
through evolution, construct a &quot;master&quot; genome symbol table using a hash
<br>
function that maps &quot;similar&quot; sequences into the same bin, then find the
<br>
closest genomes by scanning &quot;outward&quot; from the conserved regions among
<br>
the closely related genomes, working your way through the nonconserved regions
<br>
around those genes (where matching gets more difficult).  You don't really even
<br>
need the &quot;biological&quot; information so you compare insects with insects, plants
<br>
with plants, etc.
<br>
<p>Approaches similar to this have already worked out the simple mammalian
<br>
tree using only a &quot;few&quot; genes.  The detailed map between the human, mouse
<br>
and rat genomes (i.e. what chromosome breaks, joinings, inversions, etc.)
<br>
have occured has been worked out fairly well too.
<br>
<p>Now, what will be more difficult will be developing the hypothetical
<br>
paths that related to evolutionary branches that dead-ended where
<br>
we only have fossil evidence and no DNA.  In those situations 
<br>
(e.g. the Cambrian explosion) we are likely to only be able to
<br>
work out probable DNA sequences that might have generated the
<br>
body forms and these will still be pretty hypothetical.
<br>
<p>I think we will have the processing capacity to deal with the problem long
<br>
before we have the genome sequences to feed to the net to unwind evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so too it should be possible to examine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all extant accounts and determine whether reports of miracles, however 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distorted and changed by the passage of time, originated in an observation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a fictional invention. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And whether pre-1492 religions are true or false is *certainly* knowable. 
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm, I haven't followed the thread back in its entirety, but I would
<br>
probably differ with this.  Simply because humans are not accurate recorders
<br>
of &quot;what really happened&quot;, I think anything that relies on human
<br>
observation for its assertions is going to be difficult to verify.
<br>
With tracing evolution, I can read the code and read it again and again
<br>
until I have an error rate that is consistent with the assertions I
<br>
want to make.  I don't see how you can do something similar with observations
<br>
made centuries ago when there were no &quot;recordable&quot; media available.
<br>
<p>I'd also disagree with the &quot;certainly&quot; part unless you can assert that
<br>
nanotechnology enabled civilizations could not have set the &quot;Stage&quot;
<br>
to make it &quot;look&quot; a certain way.  They could have created the situations
<br>
refered to as &quot;miracles&quot; or have muddied the record to make them seem
<br>
to have occured to some &quot;arbitrary&quot; level of accuracy.  I think you
<br>
have to clarify whether you mean &quot;true&quot; in a supernatural sense
<br>
or &quot;true&quot; in the illusionary sense (human senses recorded the
<br>
physical phenomena which come down to us as recorded stories).
<br>
<p>I think you have a further problem verifying whether or not they
<br>
are &quot;true&quot; if this all happens to be a simulation.
