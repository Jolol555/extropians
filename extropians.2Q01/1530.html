<p>By that I was trying to capture the idea that the cognitive

scientists to run on sub-simulations, etc.

<p>The more you nest the simulations the more things will slow
<br>
down.  So if the phase space of what you can do is as
<br>
large as it seems (to me), and you want to explore even a
<br>
small fraction of it, then you want to do as much of the
<br>
exploration as possible using 'real' matter rather than
<br>
'simulated' matter.  Of course if you are exploring the
<br>
phase space of universes with alternate laws than it would
<br>
seem likely that most (or all) of the exploration would
<br>
have to be done in simulations.
