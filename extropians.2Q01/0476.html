<p>I'd been thinking about this too.  But then again, I would think most male 
<br>
infertility is environmental in it's cause (mumps etc.)?  I've no figures 
<br>
on this, so I could be radically wrong, but I didn't think nature selected 
<br>
for sterile men.  In which case most of these kids wouldn't have the 
<br>
problem.  Would they?
<br>
<p>It was clever of the scientist in charge to pull in the machismo memes 
<br>
though, esp. being based in Italy.  I'm sure it irks many men that current 
<br>
techniques require another mans' sperm.
<br>
<p>Wham! Bam!, I am, a man......

crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
