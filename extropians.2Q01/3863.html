<p>I don't know about &quot;seeking the truth&quot;, but one thing that has struck
<br>
me over the years is how amazingly cooperative people can be when
<br>
it comes to working together to reach some mutually-desired practical
<br>
goal.  I'm a computer programmer, and I've been repeatedly amazed
<br>
that's it's possible for a group of several dozen software people,
<br>
of different national origins (American, Indian, Chinese, and Russian, say)
<br>
and with great divergence in their ability to produce what a magazine
<br>
editor or English teacher would consider polished prose, to nevertheless
<br>
get extremely complex ideas sufficiently well communicated to each other
<br>
(in broken English) to get the job very well done.  It's rather a source of
<br>
optimism to see such a spectacle taking place, and it also nicely illustrates a
<br>
philosophical point about the significance of language that I've picked
<br>
up from my betters and retailed on this list -- namely, that words
<br>
and sentences are really (*) just a crude way for two or more human minds
<br>
to get pointed in more or less the same direction, after which a finer-grained
<br>
interaction with and knowledge of the world itself (the world of the
<br>
particular computer environment and user needs in question, in this example),
<br>
on the part of each individual, takes over and carries everybody the rest
<br>
of the way.
<br>
<p>I imagine the **real** enterprise of scientific investigation, the part
<br>
that actually takes place at the leading edge and involves planning experiments,
<br>
interacting with laboratory equipment, analyzing the results, and actively
<br>
interpreting them to discover how they integrate into the body of existing
<br>
theory and knowledge in a field, is a lot more like participating
<br>
in a successful software project (or a well-run factory manufacturing
<br>
computers, cars, or tennis shoes) than it is like participating in a theological
<br>
debate or a lawsuit (though I'm sure there's plenty of the latter spirit at
<br>
conferences and in the clash of titanic egoes in the literature).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I've been reading some of the papers in your references, and the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see it now is that there is a process which must occur in order for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone to be mutually informed about each other's beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Happy to see you reading on this.  Most of the literature does deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some stable end of a conversation, but one paper does not.   See:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Disagreement is unpredictable&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/unpredict.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/unpredict.pdf</a> or .ps
</em><br>
<p>When it comes to gassing off for pleasure (;-&gt;), or reading for pleasure,
<br>
it seems easy enough to sniff out sufficient information about your potential
<br>
interlocutor or contemplated choice of author to know in short order
<br>
whether the effort's going to have enough of a payoff to be worth
<br>
the bother.
<br>
<p>With a possible conversational partner, there's the old trick of finding
<br>
out what kind of books that person likes.  With a lot of the participants
<br>
on this list, the Web hands over this information gift-wrapped and tied
<br>
up in ribbons.  For example, I can go to Eliezer's &quot;Bookshelf&quot; page
<br>
( <a href="http://sysopmind.com/bookshelf.html">http://sysopmind.com/bookshelf.html</a> ) and see that he's a fan
<br>
of Robert Wright.  That speaks volumes (more than just the volume
<br>
mentioned ;-&gt; ) about the kind of attractors in the memetic landscape
<br>
he's likely to be hanging out around.  It means that if I were
<br>
ever to post a comment on the Extropians' containing the standard
<br>
sociobiological view of the relevance of parental investment to human
<br>
sexual psychology, I could probably count on Eliezer, at least, taking
<br>
my side (though my arguments would probably be coming out of
<br>
Donald Symons' _The Evolution of Human Sexuality_, the first book **I**
<br>
came across on the subject, rather than Robert Wright).  On the other hand,
<br>
I wouldn't dare to post such an inflammatory remark on the Usenet newsgroup
<br>
soc.motss (I did once, back in 1989 I think -- it was a mistake then, and
<br>
it would be a mistake now).
<br>
<p>Of course with Eliezer, as with other extremely smart people I
<br>
know, you can count on him putting a personal and perhaps
<br>
surprising spin on things, just for the sake of not giving the
<br>
game away!  That sort of disagreement for independence's sake,
<br>
or just to keep things interesting, is not fatal to there being
<br>
a &quot;stable end of a conversation&quot;, as long as there's implied
<br>
agreement about the basics.
<br>
<p>An author is even easier -- you can go straight to the index of a book
<br>
you've picked up at Barnes &amp; Noble, find a topic you know about, and
<br>
see what the author has to say about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When I was asking about disagreement above, I was talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initial stage in this process, when you first discover that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different posterior [anterior?] beliefs.  What is the best approach to resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the dispute?  The methods I have seen so far (as in the paper above)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are quite impractical for human beings to apply IMO as they seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; require excessively detailed knowledge about the state of the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Practic[ing] rational reasoning involves lots of error-prone reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disciplined by meta-processes that look for and correct for systematic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases.  <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/disagree.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/disagree.html</a> talks more about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Psychologists have studied this a lot.  See &quot;Metacognition&quot; and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;flexible correction model&quot;.   If you find that your disagreement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictable, I think you should think of that as having uncovered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systematic bias to correct for.   In general, you just [moor] your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the opposite direction from the bias you perceive.
</em><br>
<p>Back in the 1970's, what I was a fan of behaviorism, it was a source
<br>
of great amusement to me (and a rather shocking revelation about
<br>
the nature of some kinds of intellectual discourse) to read transcripts
<br>
of &quot;debates&quot; between B. F. Skinner and &quot;humanistic&quot; or &quot;third force&quot;
<br>
(after behaviorism and psychoanalysis) psychologists like Carl Rogers.
<br>
It became clear after a while that Skinner and these people were
<br>
not even **trying** to come to grips with each other's arguments --
<br>
they were just talking past each other, on skew trajectories, in
<br>
a sort of formal ballet of discourse.  They had long ago decided to
<br>
agree to disagree, and were just going through the motions for the
<br>
audience's sake.  It reminds me a bit of a comment that Gerald Edelman
<br>
made in a _New Yorker_ interview, as reported by John McCrone:
<br>
&quot;Interviewed in the _New Yorker_ magazine, Edelman said that the mainstream
<br>
of mind science -- dominated as it was by the computational model -- was
<br>
so far off the mark as to be 'not even wrong'.&quot;  Now when **that** kind
<br>
of disagreement is constrained by good manners, you get either avoidance
<br>
of discussion, or a &quot;debate&quot; in the style of B. F. Skinner and
<br>
Carl Rogers.  If it's not constrained by good manners, but still
<br>
taken deadly seriously, you get war.
<br>
<p>Jim F.
<br>
<p>(*) At least in the rough-and-tumble world of affairs, as opposed to language
<br>
as an aesthetic and artistic medium -- I guess a forum like this list is
<br>
more an example of the latter, amateurish as it may be, than the former.
