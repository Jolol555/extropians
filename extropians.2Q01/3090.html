</em><br>
<p>I know it's not PC on this list, and I don't claim
<br>
that anybody else should feel the same way, but I have
<br>
a hard time taking cryonics seriously -- not least because
<br>
it provokes too many humorous associations for me.
<br>
<p>For one thing, speaking of Egyptian mummification, there's
<br>
the altogether too close parallel with the outfit I saw a
<br>
TV show about a while ago, called Summum:
<br>
<a href="http://www.summum.org/mummification/">http://www.summum.org/mummification/</a>
<br>
<p>Then there's the whole association in my mind with
<br>
those aspects of California culture which New Yorkers
<br>
like Woody Allen have been making fun of for years
<br>
(cf.  &quot;The Californian Ideology&quot;:
<br>
<a href="http://media.wmin.ac.uk/HRC/ci/calif5.html">http://media.wmin.ac.uk/HRC/ci/calif5.html</a>
<br>
and the rebuttal by Louis Rossetto, editor of _Wired_:
<br>
<a href="http://www.alamut.com/subj/ideologies/pessimism/califIdeo_II.html">http://www.alamut.com/subj/ideologies/pessimism/califIdeo_II.html</a> )
<br>
<p>Woody Allen has also made the serious and somber point,
<br>
in the comedy _Sleeper_, that the kind of world a cryonaut
<br>
might wake into, or the purposes for which one might be
<br>
revived, might not be what ve might wish for prior to
<br>
cryonic suspension.
<br>
<p>One reflection that's crossed my mind that
<br>
isn't just a matter of media associations is the thought
<br>
that the nastiest aspect of death for me personally (and
<br>
probably for many other people) isn't the idea of nonexistence
<br>
per se, but rather the likelihood of having to go through a
<br>
fair amount of unpleasantness in order to reach that state.
<br>
Cryonics doesn't get you around any of that; in fact, if
<br>
anything, there'd likely enough be a fair amount of unpleasantness
<br>
at the other end, assuming you ever got revived (I'd anticipate
<br>
something at least as bad as the discomfort of being &quot;rebooted&quot;
<br>
following my barbiturate suicide attempt 20 years ago).
<br>
<p>Of course, the wish to avoid the unpleasantness surrounding
<br>
death (on whichever side of it) can be written off as
<br>
mere cowardice; but the belief that one's own personality
<br>
is important enough to take extreme measures to preserve
<br>
from nonexistence strikes me as -- unseemly, somehow.
<br>
Maybe I feel that way for the same reason I'm not a fan
<br>
of Ayn Rand, and maybe that feeling marks me out as somebody
<br>
who doesn't **deserve** such perpetuation (that has a
<br>
satisfyingly Darwinian ring to it!).
<br>
<p>Unlike HAL in _2001_, I find nothing particularly alarming
<br>
in the fact that my consciousness does, in fact, cease
<br>
to exist every night when I'm in delta sleep.  Nor do I
<br>
find the prospect that the universe will go on for billions
<br>
of years without me in it particularly alarming.  **Strange**,
<br>
yes, but no stranger than contemplating the fact that
<br>
the unverse existed for billions of years **before** I came
<br>
into it, or contemplating the unlikelihood that I should exist
<br>
at all, or contemplating the fact that the person I was
<br>
at age 5 or 15 has already almost altogether disappeared,
<br>
and is only dimly reflected in the person I am now.
<br>
<p>In fact, I even get into moods sometimes in which I'm
<br>
struck by the sheer strangeness of being limited to my
<br>
own conscious **perspective** on the universe -- I'm overwhelmed
<br>
by the thought of the sheer **simultaneity** of billions
<br>
of other human beings going about their business at this
<br>
exact moment, to say nothing about the trillions upon
<br>
trillions of other biological organisms on this planet,
<br>
and the unknown number of organisms, intelligent or otherwise,
<br>
on other worlds throughout the universe.  I mentioned this
<br>
feeling once in an oddball telephone conversation I was
<br>
having with a friend many years ago, saying something
<br>
like &quot;doesn't it ever make you feel **claustrophobic** to
<br>
be stuck in your own infinitesimal corner of spacetime?&quot;,
<br>
whereupon my friend asked &quot;have you been dropping windowpane
<br>
acid?&quot;  ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>However, getting back to media influences, the dominant
<br>
image in my mind when it comes to cryonics has got
<br>
to be the 1965 film _The Loved One_, based on the
<br>
Evelyn Waugh novel of the same name:
<br>
<a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/shop?d=v&id=1800091084">http://shopping.yahoo.com/shop?d=v&id=1800091084</a>
<br>
If I were about to sign a contract in the business
<br>
office of a cryonics outfit, the anticipation that
<br>
Liberace might appear at any moment in the proceedings
<br>
would, no doubt, reduce me to a fit of hysterical giggling.
<br>
For that matter, I don't think I could ever be certain
<br>
that I wouldn't wake up to discover that I **was**
<br>
Liberace (*).  ;-&gt;  ;-&gt;  ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>Jim F.
<br>
<p>(*) or Elvis!  ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>Even though it offers little hope of resurrection, J. G. Ballard's
<br>
portrayal of a sort of cybernetic version of cryo-preservation in
<br>
his story _The Time-Tombs_ is far more romantically appealing than the
<br>
prospect of having one's head preserved in liquid nitrogen
<br>
at Alcor:
<br>
<p>&quot;There were no corpses in the time-tombs, no dusty skeletons.
<br>
The cyber-architectonic ghosts which haunted them were embalmed
<br>
in the metallic codes of memory tapes, three-dimensional
<br>
molecular transcriptions of their living originals, stored
<br>
among the dunes as a stupendous act of faith, in the hope that
<br>
one day the physical recreation of the coded personalities
<br>
would be possible.  After five thousand years the attempt had
<br>
been reluctantly abandoned, but out of respect for the tomb-
<br>
builders their pavilions were left to take their own hazard
<br>
with time in the Sea of Vergil...
<br>
<p>The furnishings of the tomb differed from that of the previous
<br>
one.  Sombre black marble panels covered the walls, inscribed
<br>
with strange gold-leaf hieroglyphics, and the inlays in the
<br>
floor represented stylized astrological symbols, at once
<br>
eerie and obscure.  Shepley leaned against the altar, watching
<br>
the cone of light reach out towards him from the chancel as
<br>
the curtains parted.  The predominant colours were gold and
<br>
carmine, mingled with a vivid powdery copper that gradually
<br>
resolved itself into the huge, harp-like headdress of a
<br>
reclining woman.  She lay in the centre of what seemed to
<br>
be a sphere of softly luminous gas, inclined against a massive
<br>
black catafalque, from the sides of which flared two enormous
<br>
heraldic wings.  The woman's copper hair was swept straight
<br>
back from her forehead, some five or six feet long, and
<br>
merged with the plumage of her wings, giving her an impression
<br>
of tremendous contained speed -- like a goddess arrested in
<br>
a moment of flight in a cornice of some great temple-city
<br>
of the dead.
<br>
<p>Her eyes stared forward expressionlessly at Shepley.  Her
<br>
arms and shoulders were bare, and the white skin, like
<br>
compacted snow, had a brilliant surface sheen, the
<br>
reflected light glaring against the black base of the
<br>
catafalque and the long sheath-like gown that swept
<br>
around her hips to the floor.  Her face, like an exquisite
<br>
porcelain mask, was tilted upward slightly, the half-closed
<br>
eyes suggesting that the woman was asleep or dreaming.
<br>
No background had been provided for the image, but the
<br>
bowl of luminescence invested the persona with immense
<br>
power and mystery.&quot;
