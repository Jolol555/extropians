<p><em>&gt;Lee responds:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The flaw in your argument is that the mathematician is obligated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;entertain no hypotheses concerning the procedure by which the parent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;determined the truth or falsity of the statement &quot;one of my children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is a girl&quot;. The only thing that matters is whether the statement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;true. It's not the case that the father is saying &quot;I have picked...&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree of course that the mathematician is obligated to entertain no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypotheses in addition to what the father said.  But you are now quoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only part of the father's statement.  Let me quote the whole relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statement that you wrote:
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt;and I responded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Note the pair of phrases:  &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;the other&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee, did you carefully read your original message and this response??
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why do I have to keep repeating them?
</em><br>
<p>I did carefully read your response.  Please allow that I just didn't
<br>
think that you were right.
<br>
<p>Here was how you originally answered:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, this is not what Lee is really asking.  Note the pair of phrases: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;one&quot;, and &quot;the other&quot;. What the father is really asking is &quot;I have picked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of my children (not necessarily at random). That child is a girl. What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the probability that the other child is a boy&quot;. To this question the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer is 1/2.
</em><br>
<p>But aren't we talking about the entire set of parents who could
<br>
truthfully say all this?  Isn't it true that of all those parents,
<br>
two out of three of them in reality have a boy too?
<br>
<p>Of course, if he were to say &quot;my oldest child is a girl...&quot;, or
<br>
&quot;the one my mother likes best is a girl...&quot;, then we no longer
<br>
have distinguishable cases.  (My apologies Mark: I'm sure that
<br>
you already know that; I'm speaking to make sure that I'm not
<br>
misunderstood, and because I think that it is interesting.)
<br>
<p>It's possible that your &quot;focusing&quot; query for linguists does indeed
<br>
somehow (it's by no means clear to me) isolate one of the children.
<br>
<p>The rest of this post addresses Mark's question for linguists,
<br>
and in my opinion, has little mathematical interest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; take the statement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I have two children, sir&quot;, he says, &quot;and one of them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a girl.  What is the probability that the other is a boy?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this statement, does the person:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  focus on one particular child and then on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     other child? (in this case the answer is 1/2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  does not focus on any particular child at any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     time (in this case the answer is 2/3)
</em><br>
<p>I agree that it's likely that the person speaking has one
<br>
of them in mind, but not necessarily!  If you had two girls,
<br>
and someone asked you, &quot;do you have a girl&quot;, you might say
<br>
yes immediately without thinking of either one.  You would
<br>
then be capable of saying &quot;one is a girl!&quot;, &quot;one is a girl!&quot;,
<br>
each subsequent time that you were asked.  So we can contrive
<br>
situations where someone might make the above statements
<br>
without thinking of a particular child.
<br>
<p>[Yes, this is a linguistic, not a mathematical consideration.
<br>
In mathematics problems, as you know, it's not important to
<br>
consider what someone may or may not be mentally focusing on.
<br>
The hard facts are all that matter.  There is a certain
<br>
literalness, a certain trickiness, that appalls many people.
<br>
But it's even worse in courtroom law, where very literal answers
<br>
to questions are supposed to be considered very abstractly.
<br>
&quot;Mrs. Jones has seven cows and all but two died.  How many
<br>
survived?&quot;  It's immaterial what anyone is thinking.  Riddles
<br>
share this same property.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. it is ambiguous and cannot be inferred whether he does or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    does not focus (in this case the original question that Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    posed is ambigous).
</em><br>
<p>Some may claim that, and I cannot state categorically that they
<br>
are wrong.  If enough people (of the right sort) don't like the
<br>
problem, then it is ambiguous and is a bad problem.  But I like
<br>
my problem, and I think that it's fun.  :-))))
<br>
