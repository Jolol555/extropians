<p>The sociology of who reads whose postings gets interesting.  We
<br>
need the sociogram that someone was talking about.  I have no
<br>
idea what fraction of people are reading this, but it can't be
<br>
very high.  Spike echoed exactly the point that I had made in
<br>
the Pascal's Wager thread, proving he doesn't read mine.
<br>
<p>To address the question, however, I would suggest that with sufficient
<br>
matter/energy density, as occurs with collapsing black holes, it would
<br>
seem possible to me.
