<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Looks like procedings from a conference I attended last year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They're not clueless, given that you reject a singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and anticipate human expansion will follow a sigmoid curve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While we all agree the sigmoid is unlikely until we bump
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the limits of nature, others disagree.  A lot genuinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe we'll knock ourselves off soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, I'm one of them. 30 years, I'd say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dwayne
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You've got the conch shell, Dwayne. I'd like to hear your reasoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The entire history of the human race.
</em><br>
<p>We've survived it so far :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're kidding, right? You really think we will survive the mucking about
</em><br>
that is being
<br>
<em>&gt; done now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not exactly you and me. I'd say we are in for the classic chinese
<br>
&quot;interesting times&quot;, no doubt about it. But extinction? That's a tough one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand people here are a *bit* biased in favour of tech, but look at
</em><br>
the monkeys
<br>
<em>&gt; pushing the buttons and tell me we are all safe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You know, we haven't even killed ourselves with nukes yet, nor even a really
<br>
very large proportion of our population. Or with bioweapons. That's either a
<br>
damned miracle, or some hint that our crazy world has some kinds of checks
<br>
and balances built in somewhere. Or a bit of both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think you are alone in this idea, although I am yet to be
</em><br>
convinced
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of it's validity. If I keep seeing documentaries about Easter Island,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; though, I might start having nightmares...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, basically, I think some bio-weapon will get loose and do us in, or
</em><br>
something will
<br>
<em>&gt; stuff up the biosphere and take us out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, ok, that's not an unusual position to support. Leaving aside realism,
<br>
I'm not sure how useful it is to go down that path; just not very
<br>
constructive. But, that's a personal choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My current long-term plans involve somewhere remote and defensible,
</em><br>
ostensibly because I
<br>
<em>&gt; like the bush and want to set up an eco-village/community thing, but I'm
</em><br>
also aware that
<br>
<em>&gt; such a device would be mighty useful at some point in the future, at least
</em><br>
until I can
<br>
<em>&gt; afford an asteroid stocked with supermodel DNA and a clone factory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm less pessimistic about some funky physics prac taking out this end of
</em><br>
the universe,
<br>
<em>&gt; but the biologicals are just WAY yoo fuzzy for me to feel comfortable
</em><br>
with. We are
<br>
<em>&gt; tinkering with incredibly complex systems, without understanding what we
</em><br>
are tinkering
<br>
<em>&gt; with, let alone what the effects of our tinkering will be.
</em><br>
<p>Well, heading for the hills wont save you if you are right. Getting off
<br>
planet is a decent idea... I think a lot of us support getting offworld and
<br>
establishing something of humanity elsewhere, as a racial backup plan.
<br>
