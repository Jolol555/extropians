<p>What culture are you talking about?  I saw a PBS special last
<br>
night where Julia Robert's was participating in horse races
<br>
with Mongel tribesman.  I wouldn't call her experiences of
<br>
their lifestyle particularly &quot;commercial&quot;.  (Though if you
<br>
could document that they got paid for the footage, you might
<br>
be able to win that argument.)
<br>
<p>And if you really understood &quot;science&quot;, you would understand
<br>
that quite a bit of it is still non-commercial.  Commercial
<br>
entities have no incentive to develop solutions that eliminate
<br>
the need for a solution -- non-profits/foundations to
<br>
a large degree do have that incentive.  That fundamental
<br>
difference is what may drive us towards permanent solutions
<br>
to specific problems.  While a pharmaceutical company may
<br>
not relish the thought of one of their scientists claiming
<br>
&quot;I am a god, I have cured polio&quot; (think of Tom Hanks in the
<br>
movie Castaway), a politician certainly has an incentive to
<br>
play that role.
