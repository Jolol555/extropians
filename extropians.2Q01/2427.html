From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Abuse%20of%20future%20neuroscience%20applied%20technologies&In-Reply-To=&lt;13af01c0c692$cdb09300$235c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Victimless crimes should not result in prison sentences.  A lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are in prison on pot charges.  That is a major travesty.
</em><br>
<p>It likely happens because druggies are easy to apprehend, convict, and
<br>
imprison (easier than more sober felons, anyway), and the US prison industry
<br>
is an economic growth enterprise. The most violent and successful criminals
<br>
tend to avoid drugs, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I spent all my time in the future jacked in working on very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated problems and tend to forget about physical reality matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless reminded, am I then an addict or simply engrossed in my work?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, the old &quot;workaholic&quot; tag. It seems to me the world would benefit from
<br>
more people getting engrossed in work, and fewer people trying to pathologize
<br>
the life styles of others.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although admittedly I often dream of playing Technological Boddhisattva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and secretly uploading or backing them all up so that ultimately, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they so choose, there always is another chance to  grow and succeed.
</em><br>
<p>If you released the information about their back-ups, they mightn't have the
<br>
same sense of urgency to succeed in their present lives. Buddha used the
<br>
opposite trick of teaching people that they would have to re-live their
<br>
miserable lives over and over until they got it right, thus imparting a
<br>
different kind of urgency to avoid the cycle of ego suffering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe technology alone is sufficient.  With a large-scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enrolling vision or set of visions and a very solid rationally grounded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics I suspect the technology will only result in all our strengths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and flaws becoming so magnified that the change of humanity surviving is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much too small.
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes, you've indicated precisely the danger of entrusting too much to
<br>
technology *alone* because, after all, there is no technique that allows you
<br>
to appreciate the full splendor of being human/transhuman.
<br>
<p><p>ô¿ô
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
