American Families: More Traditional
<br>
By LAURA MECKLER
<br>
.c The Associated Press
<br>
<p><p>WASHINGTON (AP) - Ozzie and Harriet are not dead yet.
<br>
<p>The prototypical nuclear family of black and white TV - where mom, dad and 
<br>
their biological children all live together - may not be as endangered as it 
<br>
sometimes seems. The percentage of children living in these traditional 
<br>
families rose during the early 1990s, from 51 percent in 1991 to 56 percent 
<br>
in 1996.
<br>
<p>At the same time, other families became increasingly complex, with more 
<br>
stepparents, grandparents and adoptive parents raising children, the Census 
<br>
Bureau says in a report released Friday.
<br>
<p>It's the second report on the living arrangements of children and updates 
<br>
findings from a 1991 study. The new data examine the 71.5 million children 
<br>
living in the United States in fall 1996.
<br>
<p>The report, based on a survey of 37,000 households, both rejects and builds 
<br>
upon common perceptions of increasingly fractured families. ``It's not 
<br>
entirely a clear picture,'' said the Census Bureau's Jason Fields, the 
<br>
report's author.
<br>
<p>Most unexpected may be the rise in the proportion of children living in 
<br>
``nuclear families'' - where the children live with their biological mother 
<br>
and father and no one else. But this does not necessarily mean that more 
<br>
couples are staying together. Rather, as the total number of children 
<br>
increased, more of them were being born into traditional households, Fields 
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>That is partly because couples married or began having children later in 
<br>
life, he said.
<br>
<p>``People who delayed marriage for education or career and have decided at an 
<br>
older age than in the past, `Now we're getting married,''' are now having 
<br>
babies, he said. ``More marriages and more families are being formed, and a 
<br>
lot of them are forming as these traditional nuclear families.''
<br>
<p>In addition, births to teen-agers and to unmarried older women have fallen, 
<br>
helping to slow a three-decade climb in the number of children living with 
<br>
single parents. Still, one in three babies is born to unmarried parents, 
<br>
making that child's chances slim for life in a nuclear family.
<br>
<p>Whatever the reason, an increase in the number of children living with their 
<br>
biological parents bodes well for those children, said Kristin Moore, 
<br>
president of the research firm Child Trends.
<br>
<p>``From the point of view of children, this is the most auspicious family 
<br>
form,'' she said.
<br>
<p>Two-parent families raising their biological children tend to be better off 
<br>
economically, live in better neighborhoods and attend better schools, she 
<br>
said. ``They have the advantage of stability.''
<br>
<p>But the proportion of children living in any sort of two-parent family - 
<br>
including nuclear families as well as those with stepparents and other 
<br>
arrangements - continued to fall, from 73 percent in 1991 to 71 percent in 
<br>
1996.
<br>
<p>The report found that all sorts of non-traditional families are becoming 
<br>
more common. Specifically, in fall 1996:
<br>
<p>Single parents: About one in four children lived with a single parent, up 
<br>
slightly from 1991. Nine times out of 10, they were living with their 
<br>
mother. Still, 1.8 million children lived with their single fathers.
<br>
<p>About 3.3 million children were living with a single parent and another 
<br>
adult. In nearly half these cases, the other adult was the child's other 
<br>
parent, but the couple was not married.
<br>
<p>Blended families: About 16.5 percent of children live in a family recreated 
<br>
due to remarriage, with stepparents, stepsiblings or half-siblings. That 
<br>
compares with about 15 percent in 1991.
<br>
<p>Adopted children: About 1.5 million children were living with adoptive 
<br>
parents, but only about half of those were living with two adoptive parents. 
<br>
In most other cases, stepparents had adopted the biological children of 
<br>
their new spouses.
<br>
<p>Multi-generational: Some 5.9 percent of children lived in a home with at 
<br>
least three generations, usually because a grandparent was present. That is 
<br>
up slightly from 5.7 percent in 1991.
<br>
<p>Other relatives: 14 percent of children, or 10.3 million, were living in 
<br>
``extended families,'' where the household includes at least one person 
<br>
outside the nuclear family. In 1991, it was 12.5 percent.
<br>
<p>Children living with just one parent were four times as likely to live in 
<br>
extended families as others, as single parents look for others to share 
<br>
resources and provide extra support.
<br>
<p>Children in racial minority groups were more than twice as likely than white 
<br>
children to live in extended families, the report said. In some cases, that 
<br>
is because new family members immigrated to this country and moved in with 
<br>
relatives.
