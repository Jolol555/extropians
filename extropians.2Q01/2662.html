And you're going to report all that income to the IRS right? Oops, so much
<br>
for being private. What it comes down to is either you are willing to break
<br>
the law, or not. It doesn't matter where it is hosted, or how private it is.
<br>
I doubt you would be able to sleep very well at night if you actually got
<br>
involved in such a venture, even if it was with well-trusted individuals
<br>
(although a good futures market probably requires many many participants).
<br>
<p>You're either going to have to get the law changed, find a legal way around
<br>
it, or become a citizen of another country that allows it.
