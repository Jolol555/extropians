<p><em>    &gt;one could say I'm a  &quot;libertarian socialist&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Hungry? Care for some jumbo shrimp?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Private property is in many ways like a private form  of state.
</em><br>
<p>yes, but you almost make that sound like a bad thing.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The owner determines what goes on within the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; area he or she &quot;owns,&quot; and therefore exercises a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; monopoly of power over it.
</em><br>
<p>A &quot;monopoly&quot; over such a restricted domain is not much of a monopoly.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; worker is a part-time slave. The boss says when to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; show up, when to leave, and what to do in the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; meantime. He tells you how much work  to do and how fast.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, we agree, work sucks. If you have found an alternative you have my
<br>
full attention.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Talking back is called   'insubordination,' just as if a worker is a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; naughty child, and it not only gets you fired,
</em><br>
<p>It beats situations where talking back is called treason and the thing that's
<br>
fired is a 44 magnum pressed against the back of your head. Governments
<br>
do things like that, companies don't.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Unlike a company, the democratic state can be  influenced by its citizens,
</em><br>
<p>Baloney. Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of communicating your wishes, there
<br>
are much better ways. Every day I send hundreds of exquisitely precise messages
<br>
to the Free Market telling it what I want it to do. I also get to compare brands,
<br>
I can't do that In a democracy because I'm not voting for goods or services or
<br>
even policies, I just get to choose between two grab bags of promises every 4 years.
<br>
<p>When I vote in the economy by making a purchase I'm sure to get it, I always
<br>
win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate, the
<br>
chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not worth
<br>
my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the politician
<br>
with the better hairdo gets to make the decisions.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;&quot;It is easy to perceive that the wealthy
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; members of the community entertain a hearty distaste
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; to the democratic institutions of their country.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, but what's your point? I have a hearty (and healthy)
<br>
distaste for the democratic institutions of my country too.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;freedom means more than the right to change masters
</em><br>
<p>Quite so, it is the freedom to be left the hell alone. If you want to go play
<br>
socialist I have not the slightest objection, if you can find friends who want
<br>
to play with you that's fine too, just don't make me join your game, leave me
<br>
the hell alone. I have a pretty good idea which one of us will end up ahead
<br>
but feel free to prove me wrong, if you do you will have beaten me fair
<br>
and square in the free market of ideas.
