<p><p><em>&gt; Please don't take this issue lightly!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before you allow the telephone company (Telco) to clean out your phone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The following is taken from a Telephone New Subscriber Pamphlet dated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; November 1, 1997.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a serious side-effect to having the phone company blow or
</em><br>
clean
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out your lines.  If there is a weak spot in the insulation anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the central office and your phone, it can cause an insulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break in your phone line.  Through this break, solder ants can enter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causing an infestation, especially when the insulation break is close
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your house.  For the uninformed, solder ants, a close cousin to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaf-cutter ant, crawl through the phone lines and attack the soldered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections in phone equipment, answering machines, telephones,
</em><br>
modems,
<br>
<em>&gt; digital satellite receivers (plugged into a phone jack) and home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers, especially those using an internal modem.  They eat the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off of joints causing cold solder joints and opens.  Symptoms of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ant infestation are the crackling and popping sounds heard on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spurious reboots on your computer and wrong numbers/incomplete calls
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; your phone. Remember the electrical outage that affected nearly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; western United States several years ago?  It was caused by solder
</em><br>
ants.
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three ways to combat this pest are as follows ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Cracks in your phone line insulation, the cause of solder ant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     infestations, are caused by excess slack in cables between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     central office and your home.  This slack causes excessive bending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of the insulation on your phone lines thus causing cracks thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     allowing solder ants to enter.  In order to correct this, insist
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;     the phone company pull all the slack out of your lines from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     central office end.  This is not widely known, but the telcos must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     do this at no charge to the subscriber requesting it.  Lobbying by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the telcos prevented them from having to do this automatically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Four to six inches from the device (phone, modem, etc.) tie a tight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     knot in the phone cord to prevent solder ants from exiting to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     equipment (Make sure you loosen the knot when the lines are blown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     out!).  This also has the added benefit of preventing lightning
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt;     destroying your equipment.  It is a known fact that lightning must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     travel in a straight line and it cannot make it around the bends
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt;     a tight knot tied in your phone cord.  This is a little known fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     companies such as APC, who make surge suppression equipment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     do not want you to know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Insist that the phone company flush your lines instead of blow them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     out.  Chemicals contained in the flushing solution ward off solder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     ants and are just as effective in cleaning out your lines.  The
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt;     problem is that once notified that your lines are to be flushed,
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt;     have the responsibility of unplugging all telecom devices and
</em><br>
leaving
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the phone cord ends extended in to some type of bucket to capture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the flushing solution.  Otherwise the solution will drain all over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     equipment and require professional cleaning.  An environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     note:  Smaller, less well-financed telcos use cheaper, older, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     dangerous flushing solutions.  The residue left from line flushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     must be dealt with the same way you would deal with any petroleum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     based solvent.  The easiest way to get around this is to insist
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;     your Telco use environmentally friendly subscriber line flushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     solvents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Warning:  Do not attempt to blow out the lines yourself or try to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a line that is being blown clean.  You could destroy your phone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment or injure yourself.  It is best left to the experts.  I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been in the telephone business for twenty-two years.  I know what I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about!  ;^)
