</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It would be possible to keep them in a parking orbit by turning them
<br>
nearly edge on to the sun.  Then the raw materials could be later used
<br>
for something else, if not a return trip to Earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A solar sail would make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather easily constructed solar oven when bent into a paraboloid and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow anchored to the asteroid.
</em><br>
<p>Or a reflector to direct sunlight down to the surface of the asteroid.
<br>
Sunlight being a scarce commodity out there, I could see where a
<br>
group of solar sails shining in the night sky would be a good thing
<br>
to have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  They can also make a solar shade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the extracted fuel tanks during the trip back home to keep cooling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the hydrogen simple.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds like the most reasonable use for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I guess they are not that useful for transporting propellant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or other heavy products from the asteroid)?
</em><br>
<p>No.  The forces they provide are very small.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another use would be for the aerobraking part of the mission, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fuel tanks are aerobraked for entry into LEO. The sails are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely too flimsy to survive aerobraking in themselves, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder if they might help provide some extra drag during the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass. Any views on this?
</em><br>
<p>I wouldnt think that would be a good use for them.  An
<br>
aerobraking maneuver has all the *drag* it needs, simply
<br>
by plunging a little lower into the atmosphere.  The limiting
<br>
factor there is the amount of heat dissipation the craft can
<br>
take.  The little bit extra provided by (I assume you meant)
<br>
folding a sail over and over, then attaching to your ablative
<br>
shield would be too small to bother with perhaps.  Theres
<br>
nothing stopping us from doing the calculations, however.
