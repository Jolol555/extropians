<p>Very interesting, although a bit &quot;iffy&quot; (21 &quot;if&quot;s!).  I was looking
<br>
through some of my old extropian files last night and Lee Corbin raised
<br>
a similar question back in February 1996, in a thread titled &quot;The VR
<br>
Solipsist&quot;.  Unfortunately the extropy.org archives don't go back that
<br>
far so I have included his message below [1].
<br>
<p>The problem with these kinds of speculations is that they hinge so
<br>
much on the desires and motivations of those running the simulations.
<br>
I think for almost every point you can come up with a plausible scenario
<br>
in which the opposite conclusion would apply.
<br>
<p>Robin's first suggestion is that it is more probable that everyone else
<br>
in the world is a &quot;zombie&quot;, a being who acts conscious but actually is
<br>
not, and therefore we might care less about other people.  However many
<br>
philosophers argue that zombies are impossible (Chalmers goes into this
<br>
at great length in his book, The Conscious Mind).  Hence the fact that
<br>
we are in a VR would not imply that it is more probable that others are
<br>
zombies, since that is impossible.
<br>
<p>Even if we believe zombies are possible, we still might not want to act
<br>
uncaringly towards others since it could be harmful to us.  Presumably
<br>
there are good practical reasons why we behave as we do in the real world.
<br>
If the simulation is faithful then those reasons will still apply in
<br>
the VR.  Also, our descendants may share moral views common today and
<br>
may punish us in some way if we behave in an evil or uncaring manner.
<br>
<p>Robin also suggests that a simulation may be more likely to end sooner
<br>
than actual human history, hence you should care less about tomorrow.
<br>
However, if we are not in a simulation, actual human history may end soon.
<br>
If we are in a simulation (assuming humans or their descendants run
<br>
the sim) then this tells us that human history extends long enough for
<br>
simulations to be common, causing us to actually be more optimistic that
<br>
we could live a long time.  Plus there is the observational fact that
<br>
the world seems to be getting faster, more complex and more interesting,
<br>
suggesting that the simulation still has some way to go and is not about
<br>
to stop.
<br>
<p>Another argument is that we should work harder than we might otherwise
<br>
to make the world a wealthier place, on the assumption that this will
<br>
make it more like the world of the simulators and hence that they will
<br>
be more likely to keep the sim running.  OTOH they may be running sims
<br>
to explore alternate histories and ones which fall into the same old
<br>
predictable track will be boring.  Or it might be that they are forcing
<br>
the sim to follow some general historical path, in which case nothing
<br>
we do matters in the long term, they are just observing social details.
<br>
So we could stop working so hard to improve the world.
<br>
<p>(One observation, these and other points are predicated on the assumption
<br>
that as a simulated creature it ought to be our goal to keep the sim
<br>
running as long as possible.  Other possible goals are to have the sim
<br>
re-run as frequently as possible, or in as many different variations as
<br>
possible, or to convince the simulators to upload us from the sim into
<br>
the real world.)
<br>
<p>I won't go on, but these are just a few of the possibilities which
<br>
we would have to consider if we want to assume that we are in a VR.
<br>
Ultimately you have to guess about the motivations for the sim and
<br>
make your decisions accordingly.  Given the difficulty of predicting
<br>
the nature of a world which is rich enough to allow for this technology
<br>
to be common, I think it is virtually impossible to draw any meaningful
<br>
conclusions about what we should do.

<p>[1] Lee Corbin's &quot;The VR Solipsist&quot; from February 27, 1996:
<br>
:    Suppose someone from &quot;outside&quot; builds a secret, narrow, channel
<br>
: to you and somehow persuades you that your whole experience is
<br>
: already virtual reality.  In other words, suppose you learn that
<br>
: your world is only the execution of a program I'll call the Operating
<br>
: System.  It has been designed to convince the subject that he or
<br>
: she lives in a real world of about A.D.2000 technology.  Moreover,
<br>
: the OS is completely reliable (and realistic): you can commit suicide
<br>
: if you wish, and you'll really die (i.e., your experiences will come
<br>
: to an end).
<br>
:
<br>
:    To forestall irrelevancies, let me also postulate that you
<br>
: understand that in 30 or 40 years, you will find out a lot about
<br>
: the &quot;real&quot; world outside, but for now, it must remain a mystery.
<br>
:
<br>
:    How would your behavior change?  Because this thought is quite
<br>
: new to me, let me tell you how I think my behavior would probably
<br>
: change.  Right now, I can think of just two ways:
<br>
:
<br>
:    One, I would completely disregard the feelings of others.  Of
<br>
: course, I would not be rude to others because they would retalitate.
<br>
: For example, I could hardly disregard the apparent feelings of the
<br>
: people I work with, because I might lose my job, and I still would
<br>
: need money.  (The OS would have no problem watching me starve.)
<br>
: But if an old friend was looking forward to visiting me, and I
<br>
: really didn't want to see him, I'd just tell him I was busy, and
<br>
: under no circumstances have any regard at all for his feelings,
<br>
: since he didn't really exist anyway.
<br>
:
<br>
:    (Likewise, I'd stop feeling any concern whatsoever for the poor,
<br>
: the sick, the war-ravaged, the hungry, victims of crimes, and so on.
<br>
: I'd know that no actual misfortune, suffering, or inconvenience was
<br>
: really occuring.)
<br>
:
<br>
:    Two, while I would work towards my own indefinite survival, I
<br>
: would make no efforts to &quot;make the world a better place&quot;, except
<br>
: insofar as it benefitted me.  &quot;Fame&quot;, for example, would certainly
<br>
: mean less to me.
<br>
:
<br>
:    Am I just old fashioned?  I get the impression that for many
<br>
: people, nothing would change.  Are there ways you believe that
<br>
: your behavior would change?  Comments?
