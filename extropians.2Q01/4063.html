</em><br>
<p>There are indeed conceptual difficulties with counterfactuals, and with
<br>
identity.  But counterfactuals are ubiquitous in language and science.  So
<br>
I'm not sure I should discuss it unless they are more difficult than usual
<br>
in my context.
<br>
<p>Folks on this list should be familiar with a wide range of identity issues,
<br>
such as for example whether an upload copy of you is you.  I think we're
<br>
used to thinking of this as a matter of choice, and of definition, rather
<br>
than of reality.  Each of us gets to decide what variations on us are close
<br>
enough to still be &quot;us.&quot;  Even if it isn't &quot;you&quot; you should still be able
<br>
to make sense of the counterfactual - just call it the &quot;you-substitute.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is hard to make much sense of most physical laws without counterfactuals.
<br>
They tend to say what would happen if you did things you usually don't do.
<br>
And prior probabilities themselves don't make sense without counterfactuals.
<br>
So I don't consider it a great leap to consider counterfactuals about which
<br>
prior you have.  And I don't see how you can talk about the causal processes
<br>
that produced your priors without counterfactuals.  Perhaps Nick Bostrom,
<br>
who is better trained than I in philosphy, could offer his opinion on this
<br>
topic.
