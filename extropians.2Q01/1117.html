<p>
Years ago I went to USENET conferences and NEXT conferences.
<br>
Back in the '80's I used to go to that zoo otherwise known
<br>
as COMDEX every few years.  Almost every year now, I go try to
<br>
go to the TIGR (www.tigr.org) genome conference that used to be held
<br>
at Hilton Head, NC until it got too big and had to move to Miami.
<br>
In the past decade I've been to something like 70 conferences.
<br>
<p>Now some conferences stand out for their speakers.  And other
<br>
conferences stand out their connections you make or what you learn.
<br>
But the *most* important conferences are those that stand out
<br>
for what you can take home and contribute to others.  For those
<br>
purposes there is nothing better than a T-shirt.  There is nothing
<br>
better than walking around in a T-shirt with a genome diagram or
<br>
a molecular bearing graphic to get people interested in *what* it
<br>
is that you know that they don't.
<br>
<p>I've got my &quot;Preparing for Nanotechnology&quot; T-shirt from  a
<br>
Foresignt Nanotech conference.  I've got my &quot;11th&quot; and &quot;12th&quot;
<br>
&quot;Genome Sequencing and Analysis Conference&quot; T-shirts.  I've got my
<br>
old Extro 3 T-shirt that I think I bought one of the last of
<br>
so it was a size too small (and is therefore shrinking and
<br>
becoming too uncomfortable to wear).
<br>
<p>There have been and will be a limited number of &quot;defining moments&quot;
<br>
in human history where we engage ourselves with the vod behind
<br>
the curtain and attempt to chart a path through chaos.
<br>
Extro 5 will *be* one of those moments.
<br>
<p>And DAMNIT I want a T-shirt to wear to remember those moments by.
<br>
I want something else that those people who were to too stupid
<br>
to NOT be there will be jealous of.  I want something to sleep
<br>
in to remind me of who I am and what I stand for.  I want something
<br>
that when I go on the antique appraisal show on PBS in a hundred
<br>
years and show them *my* Extro 5 T-shirt they are stunned and
<br>
astounded by it and say that its value cannot be ascertained
<br>
because a billion sims in the solar system would be freely willing
<br>
to give up their computronium to wear it for but an hour.  I want
<br>
them to tell me that it could never be put up for auction because
<br>
it would most probably start a war.
<br>
<p>We have artists on this list.  We have people capable of creating
<br>
extraordinarily clever contra-indicatd interdomain links.  I challenge
<br>
you to come up with a T-shirt that I will be compelled to buy a dozen of
<br>
and squirrel them away in numerous safe locations so in a hundred years
<br>
I can still sleep in one of my Extro-5 T-shirts.
<br>
<p>Do we want DNA twisting into Nanocomputers?  Do we want an elderly
<br>
(benevolent) vision of a SysOP beckoning us forward?  Do we want
<br>
the extropians laying themselves down before the &quot;Green&quot; knights
<br>
sacrificing themselves because of their respect for consciousness
<br>
(sidebar -- carefully having uploaded themselves first...).
<br>
Do we want to see the extropian nanobots swarming the ISS
<br>
in a takeover coup to create an refuge before we depart for
<br>
the nearest brown dwarf to constuct Utopia???
<br>
<p>WHAT SAY YOU?  What do you want your T-shirt(s) to express and how
<br>
will you make sure you can buy one at Extro-5?  Should we have
<br>
two variants &quot;I was there at Extro-5&quot; and &quot;I really wanted to be
<br>
there at Extro-5&quot; so we can acknowledge the spirit but realize that
<br>
at times our other obligations may intervene?
<br>
<p>Or will I be the one wearing the T-shirt that says
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I went to Extro-5 and all I got was this dumb T-shirt&quot;?
<br>
<p>Robert
