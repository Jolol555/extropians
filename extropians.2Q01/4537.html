This is a fascinating speculation.  A few ideas to throw into
<br>
the mix:
<br>
<p>It doesn't make sense to transport raw information.  Information is
<br>
carried by particles.  The way the experiment was described, it sounds
<br>
like matter could and would traverse the time loop.
<br>
<p>As I understand the physics, spacetime must be consistent.  There can be
<br>
no paradoxes.  The future which sends the message is a future whose past
<br>
received the message.  As others have pointed out, this can in principle
<br>
provide virtually infinite computing power, although I believe to make
<br>
it work you have to set up near-paradoxes and eventually you are limited
<br>
by the reliability of the system.  Hans Moravec wrote an article on this
<br>
in Extropy many years ago.
<br>
<p>The original article noted that the conventional wisdom is that if you
<br>
set up closed timelike paths (i.e. time loops), virtual particles can
<br>
follow them and become amplified each time around.  A beam of radiation
<br>
spontaneously appears and destroys the apparatus.  We had some discussion
<br>
here in the past on Wormhole Wars, where the idea is to collapse the
<br>
enemy's wormhole network by adding wormholes to induce time loops.
<br>
However I think the predictions along these lines are restricted to
<br>
specific geometries and there is no proof that it would happen to all
<br>
possible time machines.
<br>
<p>Even if it worked it doesn't necessarily mean that once you set it up,
<br>
the entire future has access to you.  If you run it for a day then only
<br>
messages from that one day can reach you.  However if and when these
<br>
things become common enough then messages from the distant future can
<br>
reach pretty far into the past, close to the time of the first machine,
<br>
via indirect relay and cultural effects.
