</em><br>
<p>If you want a period of self-examination and brooding, you may take a 
<br>
&quot;drug&quot; that induces that state for a while. But if you want to have fun and 
<br>
boredom is a problem rather than a state you find useful, you would tune up 
<br>
your fun-parameters instead. My point is that emotions will come under our 
<br>
control in the future. If we have too much or too little of an emotion, it 
<br>
will be more effective to access your emotion equalizer and make the 
<br>
requisite changes rather than fumble around with bungy-jumping or whatever 
<br>
other primitive methods you currently have of trying to adjust your own 
<br>
brain-state by moving things around in the external world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I have friends who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take some of these anti-depressants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I have watched many of them have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their creativity and a large part of their joy flattened in order to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is exactly the tragedy of our current lack of control over our 
<br>
emotions. Our imperfect tools apparently don't permit your friends to enter 
<br>
the emotional states they would like to be in. Instead it shifts them from 
<br>
a horrible state into a merely awful state. Your friends might be among 
<br>
those who would most benefit from having access to their emotion equalizer.
<br>
<p>People also tend to forget, for some reason, that being happy doesn't imply 
<br>
being drugged out or sitting passively and staring at one's navel. On the 
<br>
contrary, happiness is often an enabling emotion that encourages us to be 
<br>
more outgoing and explorative.
<br>
<p>If by magic we were given an emotion equalizer tomorrow, I think it would 
<br>
be wise to be extremely cautions in the beginning. We still don't 
<br>
understand very well all the functional and social roles of our emotions, 
<br>
so there'd be a considerable risk that we'd mess up in some way or get 
<br>
stuck in a subopitmal state. It would be a tool that might require long 
<br>
practise to master (like playing a musical instrument).
<br>
<p>Our emotions are a central part of our identity, so thinking about 
<br>
technological ways of changing them might be scary, and we should 
<br>
definitely be careful. But ultimately, I'm sure that even this barrier will 
<br>
be broken (provided we don't go extinct first).
