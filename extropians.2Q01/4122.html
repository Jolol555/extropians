<p>Yeah, well after I wrote that I thought of some of the famous
<br>
anthropologists doing field work, like Raymond Dart and Konrad
<br>
Lorenz.  They sure weren't afraid to rock the boat, and if
<br>
they were unduly influenced by the Boas school, it didn't show.

<p><em>&gt;As for the vehemence directed against Freeman, this is just

</em><br>
<p>Well, I once heard from a reliable source that Freeman is 
<br>
considered a nut case by his colleagues---not that this
<br>
has anything to do with his research per se, but perhaps it
<br>
does help explain some of the animosity towards him that we
<br>
see.  If that's true, then certainly it's unfortunate that
<br>
he personally is the spokesman for debunking of Mead's work.
