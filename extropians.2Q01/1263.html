<p>Its interesting to wonder if the problem with TNF is that it
<br>
fell victim to Moore's Law?  The 19th and early part of the
<br>
20th centuries, the dreams were always &quot;bigger&quot; and &quot;larger&quot;
<br>
(you only have to look at the Saturn C designs or some of
<br>
the Russian N-1 or UR-family rocket designs to see that).
<br>
<p>But one of the consequences of the Apollo program was the
<br>
push for miniaturization that led to the development of the IC
<br>
which was the real foundation for Moore's Law.  Once we had
<br>
that in place, our enchantment with &quot;bigger&quot; got replaced
<br>
with &quot;smaller&quot;.  Since smaller requires less material, its
<br>
inherently cheaper.  So you shift to pursue this exploration
<br>
of the engineering phase space until it bottoms out, presumably
<br>
with full blown single-atom nanotechnology.  Once you have
<br>
that, exploring the phase space of &quot;bigger&quot; gets much cheaper.
<br>
<p>Now, one of the problems with TNF, was that the primary
<br>
concept was the Tokomak (or variants thereof).  This is
<br>
inherently a large scale device (and therefore expensive).
<br>
They have had to keep scaling this back because the public
<br>
and governments don't want to spend the money to build
<br>
something this large.  It will be very interesting to
<br>
see over the long term how small we will actually be
<br>
able to make TNF reactors.  If you take some of the
<br>
ion driven inertial confinement approaches (I think
<br>
Berkeley is working on these for example), combined
<br>
with nanoscale ion accelerators (right up against the
<br>
limits of the laws of physics in terms of acceleration
<br>
over distance), I'll bet you can get TNF for a lot lower
<br>
mass/power ratio than the Tokomaks.  The problem with
<br>
the Tokomak and the National Ignition Facility is that
<br>
they require such a large amount of matter to create
<br>
the energy densities to drive a fusion reaction.
<br>
<p>It is worth noting that the NIF, since its using ~10 year
<br>
old concepts and the construction is proving quite problematic
<br>
will quite likely be obsolete by the time it is finished.
<br>
Diode laser technology is moving ahead at a very fast paceu
<br>
(the NIF is powered by flash lamps of all things...)
<br>
Yet another sign of the singularity -- any &quot;big&quot; technology
<br>
instantiation you build is guaranteed to be obsolete by the
<br>
time it is finally complete.
