<p><em>&gt;A smart ranking device would give each poster exactly the kind of posts she
</em><br>
wants. Because he wouldn't read them, anyway, regardless how clever they
<br>
would appear to others.&lt;
<br>
<p>If the smart ranking device did not read the posts, it would not be able to
<br>
appraise the content of the post.  If it only went by the subject line,
<br>
anyone could trick the device.  Here is another issue -- not all the
<br>
information we might want to review is actually what we need to review. If
<br>
the device were built on extropic content-architecture, then it would
<br>
encourage diversity and assist individual growth by suggesting alternative
<br>
or additional reading material.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There can't be a single metric. It wouldn't only be pointless, it would
</em><br>
squish diversity. So attaching to each listener his personal metric would be
<br>
only fair. Doing cluster crunching (&quot;related&quot;, i.e. poster XY found the
<br>
stuff cool you also found cool, so you're members of the same cluster) is
<br>
then always possible, since the matrix is best stored server-side, anyway.&lt;
<br>
<p>I agree that there cannot be a single metric.  Extropy is not built on a
<br>
single metric.  The device would have to filter for individual preference
<br>
and also trouble shoot-mining data that could be beneficial to the
<br>
individual's future needs.  (Good friends do this:  &quot;'gene, why not try the
<br>
other club/beer for a change.&quot;)
