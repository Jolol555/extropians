<em>&gt; You've raised the enormously interesting meta-question
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet some of the very open and bright people here who
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>:-) 
<br>
<p>In an ideal world, the kind that I think many mathematicians and philosophers 
<br>
would like to live in, political views would of course be entirely based on 
<br>
estimations of objective facts, with possibly some subjective values thrown 
<br>
in. People would believe in socialism or libertarianism because they made 
<br>
sense or benefitted them in some way. People would change their views 
<br>
depending on new information.
<br>
<p>We all know this picture is not true, but I wonder how untrue it is? It is 
<br>
not totally untrue, since there are examples all around of people who do form 
<br>
opinions based on rational interpretation of facts and people who change 
<br>
their minds when they get new information. Psychological inertia (as below) 
<br>
can explain a lot of the discrepancy between the philosophers' world and the 
<br>
real world, but there are still plenty of human inconsistency and depth 
<br>
remaining to explore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are absolutely right that initial upbringing is often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the greatest determiner.  I think that what happens is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that as each of us acquires an initial view of the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we begin to selectively incorporate new data into it.  Soon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it becomes actually much more difficult to even **remember**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data that conflicts with it.  And this process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerates and hardens.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. In cognitive psychology the term is that we have &quot;schemas&quot; of how things 
<br>
work, and when we get new information we can either assimilate it (put it 
<br>
into the schema, even if a bit of forcing is required) or accomodate it 
<br>
(change the schema, heavy work). Striving for consistency and conserving 
<br>
their mental energy, most people assimilate or even ignore contradictory 
<br>
information. And the better the schemas appear to be, the less inclined we 
<br>
are to change them. 
<br>
<p>We all see it in our opponents. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way, remarks such as the flippant one I just made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are important; they keep the fires of objectivity burning.
</em><br>
<p>Humor is definitely a sign of health. It shows that we have mental 
<br>
flexibility and energy enough to play with our concepts and ideas, even to 
<br>
question them. As soon as we stop that, we no longer actively remodel our 
<br>
internal landscape, and then there is no hope for objectivity. Of course, 
<br>
some people might be flexible without humor, but humor is a good sign. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I am dying to know about:  are there any personality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlations with political beliefs?  If they exist, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be mild, but I am slowly coming to think that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do exist.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. I think I have seen some papers on this subject in the journal 
<br>
_Personality and Individual Differences_ on this, but I can't find them right 
<br>
now.
