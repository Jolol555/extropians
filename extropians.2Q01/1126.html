<p>Doesn't this mean that you might terminate soon?
<br>
(Hopefully, your answer is &quot;No&quot; and that you can
<br>
say that you have already signed up for cryonic
<br>
suspension!)

<p>As Eliezer correctly wrote:
<br>
<p>2) Lee Corbin obviously has no trouble with this situation.
<br>
He can fork himself, and the new version will have full
<br>
citizenship rights, but if he's really serious in what he
<br>
says [I am], the less efficient version will simply commit
<br>
suicide and merge resources with the more efficient version.
<br>
(And not because he planned it that way or installed mental
<br>
coercions in the new copy, which might be illegal; but
<br>
because he really doesn't care.)
<br>
<p>Eliezer's point applies to you:  what if your physical
<br>
body must now be destoryed in order to give 10^9 versions
<br>
of yourself---some of whom are exactly isomorphic to you
<br>
at this moment---the resources they require?  If you
<br>
understand the principle that &quot;duplicates are self&quot;,
<br>
you won't have any trouble with this.  If you don't,
<br>
then &quot;you&quot; simply will be missing out on a lot!
