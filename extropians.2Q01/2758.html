<p><em>&gt;&gt; Here's what one reader says about THE SPIKE on amazon.com:

<p><em>&gt;&gt; The jacket blurb casts this... in the tradition of

</em><br>

<p><em>&gt;And I'm no 12-year-old anymore (the age at which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_Profiles of the Future_ was my Bible), so any such comparison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be rather difficult to make, at least for me.
</em><br>
<p>I was a bit older than that, but I know the feeling.
<br>
<p>The hilarious aspect of the nasty crack on the amazon.com site by the
<br>
anonymous `reader' is that the supposed `publisher's jacket blurb' drawing
<br>
the comparison between Clarke's book and mine is a direct quote from...
<br>
Arthur C. Clarke. In his latest edition of PROFILES OF THE FUTURE.
<br>
<p>BTW, I'm terribly sorry for reposting that review in a form that came out
<br>
the other end looking as if it had been pre-chewed into small stupid
<br>
fragments. Ah, there's a metonomy for you. :)
