</em><br>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out to me. I'll need to read more about
<br>
sexual maturation in mice before I can form an opinion.  If you happen
<br>
to have any references, or even partly-remembered names of authors or
<br>
paper titles, I'd be grateful. Either way, when I find out more about
<br>
this, I'll follow up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some might disagree, but I think that human aging is caused by some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deleterious process acting continually over time. Good examples are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular theories: free radicals, DNA or telomere damage, mitochondrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage, etc. Generally I call senescence to the basic mechanism of aging, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the errors in the genetic program that cause our vulnerability to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with age (this excludes individual age-related diseases such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farsighteness, which would develop with or without senescence).
</em><br>
<p>I agree with that. What causes different lifespans is how well an
<br>
organism resists these deleterious processes. The ultimate control
<br>
must be genetic-- since all species are exposed to free radicals, UV
<br>
light, etc. The CR effect is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation
<br>
to famine (an animal's fertility gets down-regulated and maintenance
<br>
mechanisms get up-regulated for the duration of the famine). If we can
<br>
figure out what key genes get triggered by CR and activate them
<br>
independently of CR, that will be a significant advance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Yes, except mice and rats do *not* show a decreased overall metabolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rate (per unit of body mass) under caloric restriction. Nor lessened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;activity. Nor lessened intelligence. The possibility is still open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that the metabolic rate of individual organs or tissues is different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;under CR, with the whole body metabolic rate not significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;altered.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; As you probably know, if you increase the caloric intake of mice, they live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same. So, total energy consumption does not explain everything. You can
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I understand. Do you mean if you feed mice a higher calorie
<br>
diet than they would ordinarily eat? Or do you mean if you take CR mice
<br>
and put them on a normal diet, thus making them no longer CR?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; argue that perhaps CR forces the optimization of energetic pathways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alternatively, it would be fun if lower temperatures in CR animals somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessen molecular damage. Now, if you had a normal development and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decreased rate of aging under CR, I would be excited. Since everything is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowed down and animals develop atrophies, at the moment (and I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discard future developments in the field), it tells us very little about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senescence. And the side-effects of CR remain undesirable: you wrote &quot;Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessened activity&quot; but the animals are smaller and have lower temperatures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They can't practice exercise like normal animals! And if you apply this to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, most persons -- e.g. I -- will not accept it.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Atrophies&quot; implies pathological processes, and this is not the case
<br>
in CR animals. They have less fat, and lower muscle mass, but no
<br>
degeneration. I'll need to do some lit searching to check whether they
<br>
exhibit lower activity or retarded development. The fact that they are
<br>
smaller and weaker doesn't automatically mean they are less
<br>
active. Lower temperature is not the same thing as lower metabolic
<br>
rate-- metabolic rate is measured as oxygen consumption per gram body
<br>
weight.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Thanks for the references. One question, how do they measure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence of mice? I ask this cause it's something I've been thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about (if CR generally leads to less muscles, why not smaller brains too?)
</em><br>
<p>Ability to learn a maze, ability to remember where an underwater
<br>
platform is when they can't beneath the water they're swimming in, how
<br>
quickly they learn to avoid a situation where they get an electric
<br>
shock... there are dozens of very creative intelligence tests for
<br>
mice. It is of course debatable how any of these map to human
<br>
intelligence. I can tell you from personal experience that CR *can*
<br>
have negative psychological effects: depression and anxiety. This
<br>
could result in lowered functional intelligence. The problems went
<br>
away when I went back to a normal diet.
<br>
<p>Remember, though, the goal is learning to reproduce the improved
<br>
oxidative stress response and improved repair mechanisms induced by CR
<br>
without actually undergoing CR.
<br>
<p>Are you interested in aging research? If so, good for you-- it's a
<br>
crucial question as far as health is concerned, and interesting
<br>
from a theoretical point of view as well.
