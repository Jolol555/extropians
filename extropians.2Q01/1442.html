<p>&lt;&lt; If there were no shortage, your salaries/rates would be lower than they 
<br>
are.
<br>
&nbsp;Then, where would the incentive be to get people from overseas? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>OK, so basically you approve of a pay cap for domestic workers based on 
<br>
global competition, because the domestic workers demand too much. This is 
<br>
very much the view that I expected of those of a libertarian economic 
<br>
philosophy, and who is to say you are wrong? 
<br>
<p>But all should be forced to compete in the global market. Why not bring in a 
<br>
million medical professionals to take care of us in the USA? What about 
<br>
Sweetheart deals could be set up between health insurance companies and 
<br>
pharmacy chains-halving costs? This could apply to legal services also. I 
<br>
mean, why pay lawyers thousands of dollars when foreign attorneys could be 
<br>
much more inexpensive? How about foreign  police and fire services? Why 
<br>
should these be exempt? :-)  Eh! Its a notion. Here is a link to a law firm 
<br>
that is dedicated to protect and promote foreign IT workers. Its a 'dated'  
<br>
link but it provides a bit of info. 
<br>

<p>&lt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yah! This has been done by Microsoft, with its India based training centers 
<br>
already, but there are contracting firms bringing significant numbers of 
<br>
foreign workers, anyway (see the law firm link above).
<br>
<p>So where does that leave us? If Joe Corp executive has come to feel that he 
<br>
can get quality work of imported foreign workers, it will delight his 
<br>
shareholders if such occurs-more money in the short term. Notice how H1-Bs 
<br>
never applies to managers?
<br>
Supposedly, 5.6 million new IT workers will be needed in the USA in the next 
<br>
5 years. Gates and company may have a point, if true. If not....?
