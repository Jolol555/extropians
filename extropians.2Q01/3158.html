<p>nothing
<br>
<p>What I am feeling is some anger, mixed with disgust that one of my favorite

lists has fallen so far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; don't like someone else's post, why not just ignore it? As far as I can tell,
</em><br>
<p>Because it provides no feedback to most people (a few people might actually
<br>
realize they are being ignored on purpose, but usually they are not the ones
<br>
you have to worry about).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; this is an open forum, not an elitist clique of single-minded drones. Lighten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up a little. And if you're seriously offended by this list being &quot;infiltrated&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by people who don't think exactly like you, why not start your own list? You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have prospective members take a test or sign an oath or something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You know this forum used to be used primarily by Extropians for Extropians.
<br>
Not spending half your time defending yourself from people who /don't get it,
<br>
and don't want to get it/. Here are some sample subject lines from 1996:
<br>
<p>Private Space (was: Trans-extropian principles)
<br>
Society of the Mind - by Eric L. Harry
<br>
Ideas: The Singularity
<br>
Linda Nagata's Attriums
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Nietzsche on peace vs. truth
<br>
The Joys of Flesh (was: The Poor Masses)
<br>
Econ of Etalk and Cities
<br>
Darwinian Extropy
<br>
Strange Matter as Planetary Warfare
<br>
<p>I just randomly ripped those from the first maybe 20% of the posts of 1996.
<br>
There are many many more good and interesting subjects from then.
<br>
Now let's look at some of the recent subject lines from 2001:
<br>
<p>Re: Uncritical Techno-Cheerleaders--was ENTROPIAN ALERT! Another warning for us
<br>
to organize
<br>
Is this a new cheap way to get material into space?
<br>
rrrrr wordplay alert
<br>
&quot;NASA Ends Project Intended to Replace Shuttle&quot;
<br>
RE: SETI@Home
<br>
Hal on Science versus Religion
<br>
Anti-extropianism in the new Star Trek
<br>
Gun Control &amp; Crime
<br>
Islam, theology and politeness
<br>
GUNS: Misleading report by a true believer.
<br>
Bad Americans(?)
<br>
&quot;Mad Cow&quot; Animal Seizures in Vermont (sort of)
<br>
Tech progress graphs?
<br>
What does the US need to move ahead in Space?
<br>
LUDD: Luddite Directory?
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Re: Foot and Mouth Outbreak Intentional?
<br>
Re: Spike, the head throb!
<br>
Felons' New Right to DNA Testing
<br>
RoboDog Kills Man
<br>
SPACE: Tito To Go
<br>
<p>Do you see a difference? The more recent times spend a lot of time shooting
<br>
the breeze about current headlines, very little speculation or critical
<br>
thinking about the future. In other words the extropians list has become
<br>
little more than a current events chat list. Ok so it's not that bad, there
<br>
are still plenty of good threads... but you can see it shifting.
<br>
<p>I support ExI, and it would be pretty sad to get a lot of press/interest
<br>
from the upcoming Extro-5 only to have anyone who looks at the list then to
<br>
see a complete mess. So I'm making some small effort here to provide some
<br>
feedback before that event. There is also an upcoming improvement to the
<br>
list: the Javien reputation/ranking system. However since this is voluntary,
<br>
I am not sure if it will help much. The kinds of people I am railing against
<br>
will either ignore their rep or even take it as a badge of pride most likely.
