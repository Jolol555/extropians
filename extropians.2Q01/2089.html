<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 36'th update of my fly longevity experiments. In this run
<br>
I investigated the longevity promoting effect of Knudsen elderberry
<br>
nectar. To see if more was better, some of this nectar was partially
<br>
frozen, and the ice slush was decanted to yield a fluid that was roughly
<br>
double strength. Since the main ingrediant of elderberry nectar is apple
<br>
juice, both antioxidant-rich Santa Cruz apple cider (with apple skins), as
<br>
well antioxidant poor Sun-Rype apple juice (without skins) were
<br>
tested. Since elderberry nectar also has a small amount of boysenberry
<br>
juice, another juice (Santa Cruz berry nectar), which also has a small
<br>
amount of this juice was tested. Black Cherry juice was retested since the
<br>
last surviving fly in Run #12 (65 days) was fed this juice.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Rype apple juice had been tested back in Run #11, where it offered
<br>
a minor benefit. However this was before I started adding citric acid to
<br>
eliminate pathogen growth in the fly food. The result with this juice this
<br>
time is rather hard to believe. In the present experiment an average
<br>
longevity of about 40 days for the controls was doubled to about 80 days
<br>
with Sun Rype apple juice. Maximum lifespan was also dramatically
<br>
increased by 47% from 73 days for the controls, to 107 days for the apple
<br>
juice. This breaks my previous record for maximum longevity, which was set
<br>
in Run #7 at 88 days. Extreme effects like will have to be replicated
<br>
before I will put much credence to them. The modest benefit with
<br>
antioxidant-rich apple cider, indicates that antioxidants are unlikely to
<br>
be the active ingrediant in Sun Rype apple juice.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time elderberry nectar performed about the same as in the past,
<br>
with a good increase in average longevity, without any significant effect
<br>
on maximum survival. I taken by surprise by the effect of double strength
<br>
elderberry nectar, which like Sun Rype apple doubled average longevity to
<br>
80 days, and increased maximum survival even more (62%) to 118 days. A
<br>
further census at day 124, found that this last sole survivor had at long
<br>
last perished.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Run #18 I found that survival was better with 1/4 tsp citric acid
<br>
added to 20 gm 4-24 fly food, than 1/8 tsp. It what may be a major slip
<br>
up, I failed to test yet higher dosages of citric acid. No evidence of
<br>
pathogen growth was noted at the lower dosage of citric acid, yet this
<br>
does not mean that pathogens are not still limiting the survival of the
<br>
flies. When the flies die, their corpses are not removed from the milk
<br>
bottles that house them. Possibly some juices lengthen fly lifespan, by
<br>
providing additional acid, without inducing toxicity. Experiments are in
<br>
progress examining this possibility.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Freezer Run #8, I tried a slightly different experimental
<br>
protocol. For long term longevity experiments I use milk bottles to house
<br>
the flies, and add 20 grams of fly food, with 5 tablespoons of water. Such
<br>
a large amount of fly food is used, to delay the time it takes to dry the
<br>
food enough to adversely affect the flies. For this freeze experiment I
<br>
used 5 grams of fly food, and used plastic bags as containers. Flies were
<br>
treated to various supplement conditions for 5 days, before being placed
<br>
in the freezer. The time in the freezer was reduced because flies would be
<br>
under greater temperature stress when not protected by milk bottles.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I retested pycnogenol, as a positive control, though this time no
<br>
significant benefit was observed. Two sources of additional protein were
<br>
tested to see if extra amino acids offer any benefit. The null result with
<br>
soy, indicates that the benefit of whey protein is not due to amino acids.
<br>
Green tea polyphenols offered a significant benefit, which even eclipsed
<br>
that of whey.
