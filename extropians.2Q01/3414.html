<p>&gt; ok, now I think I should try to explain what happened in our dimension: Brian,

&gt; Extropians aren't ready for prime time.&quot; That was a slap in his face - Boom! 
&gt; There it was, without further explanation, without a &quot;But this is just my opinion&quot;,

&gt; To Brian it looked you didn't know what you were talking about. No wonder he 
&gt; was upset. But he didn't swing his fists at you. That's just your imagination. He 
&gt; just said basically (or let's say that was what he intended to say): &quot;Get out, 
&gt; educate yourself better about what you want to critizise, then come back.&quot;

&gt; &gt;It does indeed seem we're living in different dimensions, so I'll try 
&gt; &gt;to explain what happened in mine: I have not attempted to strike. 
&gt; &gt;Some guy named Brian comes at me out of the blue, swinging with both 
&gt; &gt;fists (albeit missing with both)--then stalks off claiming the high 
&gt; &gt;ground. Most curious indeed. I do hope his &quot;bubble&quot; doesn't burst.
