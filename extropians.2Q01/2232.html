Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias

<br>
<p>&quot;Now that tech stocks are in a rut, it's
<br>
comforting to tell war stories from a different era. A
<br>
favorite is the tale of how market madness in 1636
<br>
allegedly drove Dutch citizens to squander enough
<br>
provisions to last a family a year for a single rare tulip
<br>
bulb.
<br>
<p>Indeed, tulip mania has become a catchall for irrational
<br>
market behavior, particularly since the Nasdaq tanked in
<br>
April.
<br>
<p>Such is human nature, as Charles Mackay wrote in his
<br>
classic Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
<br>
Madness of Crowds, &quot;that whole communities suddenly
<br>
fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its
<br>
pursuit.&quot; Had Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
<br>
been around, he too would have wagged his finger at
<br>
Holland's irrational exuberance, right?
<br>
<p>Not so fast, says economist Peter Garber in his slim yet
<br>
fascinating book Famous First Bubbles. There's almost
<br>
always a better explanation than crowd psychology for
<br>
sky-high asset prices, he says. Garber, a Brown University
<br>
economics professor and global strategist for Deutsche
<br>
Bank (DTBKY), takes a mere 160 pages to debunk the
<br>
myths surrounding tulip mania, as well as its sisters in
<br>
mythology, the South Sea bubble and the Mississippi
<br>
bubble.
<br>
There is a difference, Garber writes, between uncertainty
<br>
about the future - which drives innovators, risk-taking
<br>
entrepreneurs and eventually markets - and mob
<br>
psychology. The Netherlands, for example, was a
<br>
sophisticated trading center, with well-developed
<br>
commodity markets. That rare varieties of tulip bulbs
<br>
could fetch high prices among professional traders was
<br>
not irrational. The tulips could be used to grow many
<br>
more valuable hybrids and often earned their purchasers
<br>
far more than they invested. Indeed, this pattern still
<br>
exists today. In 1987, serious traders paid as much as
<br>
$500,000 for a new breed of tulip, fully intending to make
<br>
good on the investment.
<br>
<p>That highly specialized market is not to be confused with
<br>
the more speculative futures contracts made by Dutch
<br>
laymen. Hunkered down in taverns, they traded common
<br>
bulbs, and for one month in early 1637 provided the basis
<br>
for all those hair-raising anecdotes.
<br>
<p>But even those deals, Garber points out, were not spurred
<br>
by madness. They were nonenforceable gambles on
<br>
futures contracts by people who knew their margins would
<br>
never be called. Indeed, when the government suspended
<br>
all such contracts in early 1637, authorities let buyers off
<br>
the hook on payment of 3.5 percent of the contract price -
<br>
hence the legend of a disastrous price decline. &quot;This was
<br>
no more than a meaningless winter drinking game,&quot;
<br>
Garber writes, &quot;played by a plague-ridden population... .&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, the Dutch economy chugged along, undamaged by
<br>
the &quot;bubble,&quot; for another 10 years....&quot;
