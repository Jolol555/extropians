<p>Spike, I can't tell if your post is tongue in cheek or not.
<br>
What I meant to say and may not have conveyed is that
<br>
multiple people have your name or Mike's name.  I think
<br>
Mike had a Comp Sci Prof. in the U.K. and you had a
<br>
Jazz Musician as alter egos.  (I didn't look at this
<br>
stuff closely).  As a consequence one cannot do a simple
<br>
search on your name or Mike's and turn up unique reference
<br>
counts.  Even Damien, as he relayed to me off-list, is
<br>
not immune to wanna-bes... Though you make a good point
<br>
that not many people would want to be *known* as
<br>
light-bulb-joke tellers...
<br>
<p>But even in your most prolific I don't think you have 10,000+
<br>
light-bulb-changing jokes recorded on the net...
<br>
<p>If you want to play with it go to the Google advanced search
<br>
page and enter your name under the match exact phrase box.
<br>
<p>Robert
