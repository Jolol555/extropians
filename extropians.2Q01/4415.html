<p>When I read the papers over the last days, I also was struck by the extreme 
<br>
conservatism of the views. But on the other hand, as some of them noted, 
<br>
until recently the whole idea of discussing the future of evolution was out 
<br>
of bounds. So this colloquium is actually a step in the right direction.
<br>
<p>The big mistake is that most papers discuss how natural evolution might be 
<br>
affected by the activities of a civilisation like the current.  The implicit 
<br>
assumption was either that humans would either vanish somehow or become 
<br>
totally zero-impact, and then evolution would continue as usual from the new 
<br>
situation. It is interesting to note that none of the papers I have read 
<br>
discuss human evolution in this context, the bias is entirely towards the 
<br>
nonhuman biosphere (David Western menstioned that many ecologists have been 
<br>
very directed towards the abiotic parts of the ecosystem rather than the 
<br>
biotic until recently; this might simply be a holdover). I agree with Robin 
<br>
that not taking the effects of *continuing* human action into account renders 
<br>
most of these papers rather pointless, unless the assumption is that humanity 
<br>
dies out in the very near future with a fairly minimal ecological impact.
<br>
<p>So, what would a transhumanist paper in this colloquium have included? I 
<br>
think the method would be to first sketch a number of possible scenarios of 
<br>
long-term human development and then study how they would affect the 
<br>
biosphere. This is hard, and would bring in issues of long range economics 
<br>
(gigaeconomics? exconomics?) and cultural evolution into the discussion. In 
<br>
most cases the future state of the biosphere would be totally contingent on 
<br>
human values, not natural evolution. This is an interesting concept if it 
<br>
could be brought into the conservationist discourse, because it implies a 
<br>
vast shift in how the biosphere works, not just a question about how it is 
<br>
affected on the species or biome or environment level. It might be that many 
<br>
conservationists would consider such a human-regulated ecology (I call it a 
<br>
cyborg ecology in a paper I'm writing) a bad thing, but at present the whole 
<br>
concept seems to be entirely outside of their discourse (several papers 
<br>
discuss the human footprint or shadow, but does not view humans as a key 
<br>
species or evolutionary force in itself - maybe a holdover from the romantic 
<br>
origin of the environmentalist movement).
