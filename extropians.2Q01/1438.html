<p>&lt;&lt; Mitch, knowing Larry to the degree that I do, I very much doubt he
<br>
&nbsp;would cooperate with Bill on anything (even something that is
<br>
&nbsp;to their mutual advantage).  I would strongly urge you to
<br>
&nbsp;investigate the background sources on your comments.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The source was, as I remember, the news in June 2000, from AP News service, 
<br>
talking-up the new exciting study that we will be needing droves of new IT 
<br>
workers over the next 5 years. It claimed that there would be a tremendous 
<br>
short-fall of workers. The article, as I recall, also noted that the study 
<br>
recommeded that an increase in foreign workers be implemented to overcome 
<br>
this death. I will attempt, tomorrow to come up with sources, date of 
<br>
publication, and the like to buress my concern.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;To make a case that MSFT or ORACLE are behind this, you have
<br>
to make a case that it is more to their advantage to move
<br>
offshore workers to the U.S. where the salaries would be higher.
<br>
<p>Robert&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Certainly, the promotion of an industries best interest is not illegal and is 
<br>
not a RICO-class conspiracy, by my understanding. But it would serve the 
<br>
short-term interest of companies to plump-up the Quarter and Annual reports, 
<br>
to the pleasure, of the share holders. That is, until the American-born 
<br>
schmucks, start experiencing a decline in their standard of living. That 
<br>
effect, if it were to occur, is something that I am concerned about. 
<br>
<p>No, I have not proven this contention. It seems that what I know of the 
<br>
salaries made by the folks brought in to work at my company, I have heard 
<br>
that they are making much less then the American Citizen proggies. In a 
<br>
court, this would just be hearsay. I believe there would have to be an 
<br>
investigation (or economic analysis)  to analyze whether this rumor has a 
<br>
valid basis behind it. So is there currently a deep shortfall in IT workers? 
<br>
I dunno. Is this report that I quote merely a means of shortchanging USA 
<br>
workers? I dunno. I will try to find out.
