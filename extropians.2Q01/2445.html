<em>&gt; armiphlange&quot;? :-)
</em><br>
<p>Any campaign that centers altered or improved cognition is a Singularity
<br>
campaign, not just campaigns where the main action takes place in the High
<br>
Transcend or SIAI's basement.  There's the entire realm of neurohacked
<br>
humans to consider, for example.  And uploads.  And brain-computer
<br>
interfaces.  And infrahuman and human-equiv and only slightly transhuman
<br>
AIs.  And all the gruesome GMing possibilities that open up when, no
<br>
matter what the players do, you can pretend that the evil transhuman
<br>
opponent thought of it three months in advance and had a horrible trap
<br>
ready; where losing a battle or being captured by the enemy or finding the
<br>
McGuffin can alter the character's mind and personality (and &quot;IQ&quot;
<br>
attribute); where the players, even with their magic technology, can't
<br>
outfight *or* outsmart the enemy and are forced to try and work within
<br>
whatever complex manipulative strategy the enemy is running them through;
<br>
where pieces of the character's thoughts and personality can wind up
<br>
embedded in random Internet sites, or the opponent; where the &quot;players&quot;
<br>
only slowly learn that they are pawns in a still more complex game, and
<br>
they're never quite sure which of the real Players are the good guys, and
<br>
they'll *never* be able to extricate themselves...
<br>
<p>When the enemy is a transhuman, you can do *anything* to the players.  You
<br>
can have them fight their way through the enemy fortress to find the
<br>
self-destruct button, and when they find it, there's a little sign saying
<br>
&quot;Out of Order&quot;.  Roleplaying a game where the players are also transhuman
<br>
would obviously be a lot more difficult, but it could be done, perhaps by
<br>
allowing the players to get away with far more devious and twisted
<br>
strategies than would ever work in real life, or by modifying the
<br>
campaign, invisibly and on the fly, so that whatever &quot;transhuman
<br>
deductions&quot; the players come up with turn out to be the truth.
<br>
<p>There is more to the IQ attribute than the Gadgetry skill; roleplaying a
<br>
transhuman *properly* is the final challenge, for GMs or players. 
<br>
*That's* a Singularity campaign.
<br>
<p>And then there's simply Ravna and Pham trying to outrun the Blight, or
<br>
Roger and Deborah diverting the DoD's tanks while fighting it out with the
<br>
Mailman.
