Greenpeace Cofounder Supports Biotech
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://ens-news.com/ens/mar2001/2001L-03-08-09.html">http://ens-news.com/ens/mar2001/2001L-03-08-09.html</a>&gt;

<p>AUBURN, Alabama, March 8, 2001 (ENS) - Dr. Patrick Moore, ecologist and co-
<br>
founder of the international conservation group Greenpeace, stated Tuesday
<br>
that, &quot;the campaign of fear now being waged against genetic modification is
<br>
based largely on fantasy and a complete lack of respect for science and
<br>
logic.&quot;
<br>
Moore joined more than 3,000 scientists from around the world in signing a
<br>
Declaration in Support of Agricultural Biotechnology, sponsored by the
<br>
nonprofit AgBioWorld Foundation.
<br>
&quot;In the balance it is clear that the real benefits of genetic modification
<br>
far outweigh the hypothetical and sometimes contrived risks claimed by its
<br>
detractors.&quot;
<br>
Moore, who is now an environmental consultant, was a founding member of
<br>
Greenpeace. He served for nine years as president of Greenpeace Canada and
<br>
seven years as a director of Greenpeace International.
<br>
Moore broke with Greenpeace in recent years, accusing the group of
<br>
abandoning science and following agendas that have little to do with saving
<br>
the Earth. Reiterating comments he made to the New Zealand Royal Commission
<br>
on Genetic Modification, Moore said, &quot;Genetic modification can reduce the
<br>
chemical load in the environment, reduce the impact on non-target species,
<br>
and reduce the amount of land required for food crops.&quot;
<br>
&quot;There are so many real benefits from genetic modification compared to the
<br>
largely hypothetical and contrived risks that it would be foolish to ban
<br>
genetic modification,&quot; Moore added.
<br>
Other signers of the Declaration of Scientists in Support of Agricultural
<br>
Biotechnology, available at: <a href="http://www.AgBioWorld.org">http://www.AgBioWorld.org</a>, include Nobel Prize
<br>
winners Norman Borlaug, James Watson, Paul Berg, Peter Doherty and Paul
<br>
Boyer. The AgBioWorld Foundation is a project of biologist C.S. Prakash,
<br>
director of the Center for Plant Biotechnology Research at Tuskegee
<br>
University.
<br>
Prakash serves on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural
<br>
Biotechnology Advisory Committee and also on the Advisory Committee for the
<br>
Department of Biotechnology of the Government of India.
