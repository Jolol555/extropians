</em><br>
<em>&gt; What will our children inherit?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Liz Elliott
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For most tribal and village people, for most of human history, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmos felt to be a place of belonging and security, with significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections to  nature and community.
</em><br>
<p>This is questionable; however, I have to admit that the village people I've
<br>
known *have* generally seemed happier, more relaxed, less subject to
<br>
depression than urban people. In creating a future, I think it would be well
<br>
worth looking at tribal structures not as curiosities; rather to better
<br>
understand conditions under which humans are happiest. I don't think the
<br>
current urban lifestyle is the answer; even for the wealthy it doesn't seem
<br>
reasonable to say it's the best way to live. One only has to look at the
<br>
mass consumption of antidepressants and drugs such as alcohol to realize how
<br>
many people are unhappy. And these would be the *rich* people who can afford
<br>
to go to doctors and spend money on antidepressants.
<br>
<p>To refresh everyone's memory, here are some excerpts from Donella H.
<br>
Meadows' STATE OF THE VILLAGE REPORT (published in 1990 so it's a bit out of
<br>
date by now but still fairly accurate, I think) [Donella (Dana) Meadows,
<br>
systems analyst, journalist, college professor--Dartmouth, international
<br>
co-coordinator of resource management institutions, and farmer. She was
<br>
trained as a scientist, earning a B.A. in chemistry from Carleton College in
<br>
1963 and a Ph.D. in biophysics from Harvard University in 1968]
<br>
<p>======================================
<br>
The Global Citizen May 31, 1990
<br>
<p>Donella H. Meadows
<br>
<p>STATE OF THE VILLAGE REPORT
<br>
<p>If the world were a village of 1000 people:
<br>
584 would be Asians
<br>
123 would be Africans
<br>
95 would be East and West Europeans
<br>
84 Latin Americans
<br>
55 Soviets (still including for the moment Lithuanians, Latvians,
<br>
Estonians, etc.)
<br>
52 North Americans
<br>
6 Australians and New Zealanders
<br>
<p><p>One-third (330) of the people in the village would be children. Half
<br>
the children would be immunized against the preventable infectious
<br>
diseases such as measles and polio.
<br>
<p>Sixty of the thousand villagers would be over the age of 65.
<br>
Just under half of the married women would have access to and be
<br>
using modern contraceptives.
<br>
<p>In this thousand-person community, 200 people would receive three-
<br>
fourths of the income; another 200 would receive only 2% of the
<br>
income.
<br>
Only 70 people would own an automobile (some of them more than
<br>
one automobile).
<br>
About one-third would not have access to clean, safe drinking
<br>
water.
<br>
Of the 670 adults in the village half would be illiterate.
<br>
<p>The village would have 6 acres of land per person, 6000 acres in all
<br>
of which:
<br>
700 acres is cropland
<br>
1400 acres pasture
<br>
1900 acres woodland
<br>
2000 acres desert, tundra, pavement, and other wasteland.
<br>
The woodland would be declining rapidly; the wasteland increasing;
<br>
the other land categories would be roughly stable.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The village would allocate 83 percent of its fertilizer to 40 percent of
<br>
its cropland --
<br>
that owned by the richest and best-fed 270 people. Excess
<br>
fertilizer running off this land would cause pollution in lakes and
<br>
wells. The remaining 60 percent of the land, with its 17 percent of
<br>
the fertilizer, would produce 28 percent of the foodgrain and feed 73
<br>
percent of the people. The average grain yield on that land would be
<br>
one-third the yields gotten by the richer villagers.
<br>
<p>The village would have buried beneath it enough explosive power in
<br>
nuclear weapons to blow itself to smithereens many times over.
<br>
These weapons would be under the control of just 100 of the
<br>
people. The other 900 people would be watching them with deep
<br>
anxiety, wondering whether the 100 can learn to get along together,
<br>
and if they do, whether they might set off the weapons anyway
<br>
through inattention or technical bungling, and if they ever decide to
<br>
dismantle the weapons, where in the village they will dispose of the
<br>
dangerous radioactive materials of which the weapons are made.
<br>
========================================
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Land was communally owned and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cared for.
</em><br>
<p>This was true in some cases and not true in others. Land has been well cared
<br>
for under both communal forms of ownership and private ownership. Likewise,
<br>
land has been wasted under both forms of ownership.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In modern suburban, mobile culture we become cut off from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the land and our neighbours, and thus suffer anxiety.
</em><br>
<p>I have directly observed this to be true.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;To sedate this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emptiness, the richest 20% of humans consume 80% of the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources, vast amounts of stuff
</em><br>
<p>It's difficult to know for sure what motivates people to accumulate more
<br>
stuff than they can realistically use. From personal observation and
<br>
introspection, I know that in some cases the motivating factor is
<br>
insecurity, the belief that if one has a bigger house, more money, more
<br>
stuff, one will be safer.
<br>
<p>I make a point of asking people what motivates them when I can do so without
<br>
being rude; many work-a-holics have told me they'll slow down once they get
<br>
&quot;enough&quot; money. But not one of them has been able to define &quot;enough.&quot;
<br>
<p>, polluting air and water and
<br>
<em>&gt; destroying soil fertility.
</em><br>
<p>I know this is true from personal observation as well as reading and hearing
<br>
other people's observations.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Consumerism and the religion of economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth distract us from the purpose of human life
</em><br>
<p>The above statement is meaningless unless one has a definition of the
<br>
&quot;purpose of human life.&quot;
<br>
<p>; softening the
<br>
<em>&gt; underlying transfer of interest/debt money, power and resources to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top 1%, blinding us to the great impoverishment of environment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community and Third World enslavement.
</em><br>
<p>I've noticed that consumerism keeps people so busy they don't have time to
<br>
stop and consider what they're doing and whether it's their best course of
<br>
action. Most people I know, even ones who have net income of more than
<br>
$100,000 per year, spend almost their entire paycheck on current expenses
<br>
and debt service. They're chained to their jobs, because if they quit or
<br>
switched to lower paying work, they wouldn't be able to pay the debt. Many
<br>
of them have less than a year's worth of living expenses in savings (in some
<br>
cases, less than a month). Although these people are surely better off than
<br>
slaves, I don't think they could be called free by any stretch; and many of
<br>
them are terribly unhappy. They *do* use the purchase of new stuff to give
<br>
them a fleeting sense of accomplishment and happiness. And they *aren't*
<br>
aware of the cost of their lifestyle to other people and to the environment.
<br>
Most of them have no idea that rich, friable river-bottom land has been
<br>
converted (in less than a hundred years in most cases) into semi-barren
<br>
cement-like soil that cracks when the weather's dry and floods when it
<br>
rains.
<br>
<p>They have no idea of the conditions under which the cattle that were made
<br>
into their steaks and hamburgers lived. Feedlots and meat packing plants
<br>
aside, much of the pastureland is in terrible condition, over grazed, made
<br>
to continue producing only through the use of huge amounts of fertilizer and
<br>
pesticides such as 2,4-D. The 2,4-D breaks down within a reasonable amount
<br>
of time upon exposure to ultraviolet light, but it persists for *years* in
<br>
the shade. I know this from personal experience and from talking to
<br>
agricultural agents who were trained in universities supported largely by
<br>
dollars from chemical companies. These guys were taught that 2,4-D is good.
<br>
But they begin to doubt what they were taught when they see that manure from
<br>
cattle grazed on treated pastures contains enough 2,4-D to kill broadleaf
<br>
plants for years; and when they notice that all the ranchers who've been in
<br>
the business for a number of years get prostate cancer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Consume more!&quot; urge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations, which spend more on advertising than the world spends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the advertising is to blame. Consumerism seems to come more
<br>
from a lack of substance in people's lives. They look for self-worth in the
<br>
number of possessions they have and the size of their bank accounts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However  it cannot go on.
</em><br>
<p>This is true. Something has to change.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If we all lived like Americans we would need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three planets. And we are heading for 11 billion population in 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years The maths of environmental destruction to pay debt shows this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excessive consumption cannot go on; it is a compounding interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation where 3% growth a year means 7 times the production in 60
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years.  The CSIRO estimates we Australians must decrease their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resource use by 90% in 100 years!.
</em><br>
<p>CSIRO stands for Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
<br>
Organisation. The CSIRO scientists are *not* in the business of predicting
<br>
doom. They're working on technological solutions. Containment and reversal
<br>
of salinity degraded lands is one of their projects. Dryland salinity occurs
<br>
when native vegetation is cleared and the land is used for shallow-rooted
<br>
annual crops. The water table rises, bringing salts to the surface. Such
<br>
land doesn't support and plant life, although research is being done to
<br>
develop salt-tolerant crops. Salinization can be prevented by planting trees
<br>
and deep-rooted perennial crops such as lucerne (alfalfa)
<br>
<p>&quot;Dryland salinity which affects almost 2.5 million hectares of Australian
<br>
farmland, is expanding at a rate of 3-5% a year and costs $270 million per
<br>
year in lost production. Estimates indicate that containment and reversal of
<br>
existing salinity degraded lands would provide an additional $810 million in
<br>
farm revenue per annum.&quot; <a href="http://www.csiro.au/">http://www.csiro.au/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  How will we do this? Since 50%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plus of prices=effort=environmental use are to pay interest, i.e. make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the richest 5% richer
</em><br>
<p>Governments are in the same predicament as individuals with respect to debt
<br>
service.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;,  much resource use could be reduced by bank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restructuring. Taxes and waste could be markedly reduced. Economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth must be reduced by 2% a year, particularly with fossil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel/greenhouse emissions, and replaced with growth in ecology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community, art/music, family, health  and sprituality.
</em><br>
<p>I would be interested to know more precisely what Elliott has in mind with
<br>
respect to bank restructuring and &quot;ecology, community, ...&quot; etc. I agree
<br>
that taxes and waste could be markedly reduced.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a decline in true standard of living! In fact, a great opportunity!!
</em><br>
<p>I agree with Elliott here as well. In many cases accumulated stuff lowers
<br>
one's quality of life rather than raising it. People end up spending more
<br>
time caring for their stuff than enjoying it. I think I've mentioned before
<br>
on this list that a turning point in my life came when I spent a morning
<br>
with a &quot;homeless&quot; woman and realized that her quality of life was actually
<br>
higher than mine (I was making fairly decent money practicing law but had
<br>
far less discretionary time than I wanted).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The current &quot;Economic Growth in GDP&quot; goal is based on false accounting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (destroying our natural capital and calling this growth!)
</em><br>
<p>This is absolutely true. I can say this with a high degree of certainty
<br>
because in addition to a law education I have a master's degree in business
<br>
and have professionally practiced accounting for a number of years (I was a
<br>
tax lawyer and still provide tax and accounting services for a few clients).
<br>
Generally accepted accounting methods don't adequately reflect the costs of
<br>
production.
<br>
<p>This is another case of consumers not being aware of the true costs of their
<br>
lifestyles. This is particularly relevant to people who intend to live for a
<br>
long time, because many of the costs are being pushed into the future
<br>
instead of recognized currently. If you die at the age of 75, you might not
<br>
ever have to worry about dealing with it. But if you live to be 150, you
<br>
probably will have to worry about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; commercialising the huge unpaid love economy
</em><br>
<p>I think what she means here is raising kids in daycare centers instead of at
<br>
home, eating prepared foods instead of cooking, buying food instead of
<br>
having a garden, that sort of thing.
<br>
<p>, on exporting our soil,
<br>
<em>&gt; water and work and beggaring-our-neighbours and on failing to pay the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true cost of our consumption rampage. Our children will have to pay.
</em><br>
<p>Or *we* will have to pay if we live longer than the traditional human
<br>
lifespan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the cleanup will be much more expensive than the costs &quot;saved&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the short run.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. It's almost always harder to fix a mess than to do things right in
<br>
the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We are wasting a precious opportunity to invest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustainable technology, so that our children can live off the interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for instance using petrol for solar cells manufacture).
</em><br>
<p>I agree. It makes far more sense to be more efficient and less wasteful
<br>
*now*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true standard of living taking into account environmental loss, crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and others stresses, has been dropping since 1975.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about this statement, but I think it's probably pretty
<br>
accurate. I didn't comment on the book that was mentioned on this list
<br>
recently on the theme &quot;We've Never Had it Better.&quot; But I found the standards
<br>
of measurement being used by the author highly misleading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Free market/ economic irrationalist ideology is based on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perversion of Adams Smiths ideas; Smith never envisioned producers not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying their true costs of production, nor of capital being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internationally hypermobile.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is true. The economic system we have at the moment is very far
<br>
from &quot;free enterprise&quot;. By removing responsibility from consumption, the
<br>
corporate system has the same devastating &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; effect as
<br>
the worst forms of socialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since profits in the unreal financial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy, derivatives, shares, merger driven profits etc have been 20%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plus,  investments in the real world of food, transport and housing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must perform to the same unsustainable  profit return if they are to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attract scarce capital. Such high profits are only possible by not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying tax, stressing workers and gouging the Earth.
</em><br>
<p>I don't entirely agree with the statement, but I do agree that profits shown
<br>
on financial statements don't represent real value and that bottom lines
<br>
being shown by agribusiness are based on dishonest accounting methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Elders everywhere tell the same story; their land does not look as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lush or healthy as it used to. Gone are the great cod fisheries of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eastern Atlantic, the Amazon  goes in 25 years, and oil will start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running out in 20 years. Humans already use 50% of world fresh water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and arable soils. Minerals and petrol we extract will in future be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from  more marginal, harder to access sources. A quarter of a million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acres of forest are lost a day. Trees are nature's water pumps, rain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makers and nurseries. At the current rate of soil loss through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desertification, salination and erosion, there will be no arable soils
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within 100 years. Agribusiness mines soils till they are just root
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holders to pour chemicals into. 12 kilos of soil are lost for every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kilo of food produced. Globalized corporations scour the world for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheapest raw materials, lowest environmental standards and worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working conditions for workers, small business and farmers.
</em><br>
<p>This is all basically true, although I don't know about the accuracy of her
<br>
figures--they're only rough estimates.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The feedlot dairy industry is a classic agribusiness disaster, cruel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cows, polluting to rivers, wasteful!
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what she means by feedlot dairy industry. In the US feedlots
<br>
are used to fatten up beef cattle. This has nothing to do with the dairy
<br>
industry, aside from the fact that some of the beef cattle come out of dairy
<br>
cows (I hope I don't insult anyone's intelligence by mentioning that a cow
<br>
has to have a calf before she'll produce milk. In cases where a dairy farmer
<br>
doesn't want more dairy cattle, for whatever reason, the cows might be bred
<br>
to meat-producing breeds such as Beefmaster with the intent of raising the
<br>
calf for the meat market)
<br>
<p>Anyhow, back to the feedlot industry--in addition to being cruel to the
<br>
animals, the method produces meat that is probably not healthy to eat.
<br>
<p>Chickens raised in chicken factories have useful lives of only a couple of
<br>
years, get cancer and other loathsome diseases. I believe I've read that
<br>
bovine growth hormone shortens the useful lives of dairy cows. The factory
<br>
farms are &quot;profitable&quot; largely due to government subsidies and dishonest
<br>
accounting methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And capital intensive so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers are progressively turned into bank serfs.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the US, chicken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hog farmers are dictated to every step by giant vertically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrated feed, fertilizer and storage companies like Cargill.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a price squeeze or climate problem, when the farmers take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk and their holdings are resumed by the banks, also owned by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cargill, ArcherDanielMidland  and Aventis. Everywhere farmers' margins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are reduced, whilst supermarkets and transport/fuel corporations make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher percentages.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. In some cases, the corporation provides seed, some of the machinery,
<br>
fertilizer and chemicals. The farmer gets a per cent of the gross profit.
<br>
This was called sharecropping in the old days and was not something people
<br>
aspired to. In most cases, the corporate/government combo controls commodity
<br>
prices. This is *not* free enterprise by any stretch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chemical intensive/ petrol using farming and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transporting sends farmers broke!
</em><br>
<p>Yep. And then the corporations (or more likely, their head honchos) pick up
<br>
the land real cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;International and continent wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transport of basics is unnecessary and polluting, yet supermarket
</em><br>
<em>&gt; style food chains are seen as cheaper.
</em><br>
<p>Again, dishonest accounting methods, especially if you figure in health care
<br>
costs associated with eating unwholesome food.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Cheap&quot; at the expense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers, environment and climate. Our climate is becoming more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstable due to Big Oil protecting its investment in anachronistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyone knows for sure what's happening with the weather, but
<br>
it does seem unstable lately.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Our seas and waterways are used as a toxic dump; 13
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million tons of chemicals go into our environment every day. Chemicals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not recyclable, biomagnify and are totally unknown in their long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term effect. 1000 new chemicals a year enter the US market, only 25
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tested, never in the long term, on sensitive people or in combination.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about the exact figures, but I know from personal observation
<br>
that the seas and waterways are being trashed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human physical health is threatened by agribusiness style farming; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these chemicals, genetic engineering and proliferation of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diseases.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the bad health effects of many of the chemicals. I don't think
<br>
anyone knows enough about genetic engineering to say one way or the other. I
<br>
do believe that great benefits can come from genetic engineering, but I
<br>
don't like the direction it seems to be going at the moment. I don't trust
<br>
corporate management. I know they've lied about the safety of various
<br>
chemicals, so I would expect them to lie about other things as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The shallow mineral and essential oil content of speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grown, longhauled supermarket supplied food system predispose to heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease, cancer and depression, typical western diseases.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is probably true, though I don't know for sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exaggerated by worker stress and loneliness of the marginalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unemployed, old and young.
</em><br>
<p>This is probably true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Poorer nations' people suffer from simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infections and stress, due to spending more on debt repayments than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Health, Education or Water.
</em><br>
<p>This is bull shit, I think. Infections, stress, bad health, dirty water all
<br>
existed long before debt repayments and wouldn't magically go away if the
<br>
debt was forgiven. However, as with individuals who are chained to their
<br>
jobs through consumer debt, the options of the debtors are certainly
<br>
limited.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the Two Thirds World, efficient peasant farmers are threatened by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monoculture farming for export.
</em><br>
<p>I know this is true from personal observation as well as what I've read and
<br>
been told.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Small scale farms are much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient than industrialised farming in terms of energy in/energy out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and total yield per acre.
</em><br>
<p>This is true *only if* efficient methods are used on the small scale farms.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;.Small farmers are undermined by dumping of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsidised foods produced by unsustainable methods, and by excessive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulations favouring agribusiness,
</em><br>
<p>I know this is true from personal observation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;genetically engineered seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oligopolies and irrigation/big dams.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is necessarily true. The harm is caused by the government
<br>
subsidies which favor the use of chemicals, and the presently available
<br>
genetically engineered crops are designed to work with chemicals and
<br>
irrigation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Colonialism with greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental degradation! Once stable selfsufficient communities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disintegrate. Rural to city migrations create sweatshops which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undermine all workers' conditions and cause illegal emigration and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars.
</em><br>
<p>True. And in many cases the rural to city migrations are not voluntary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Water and resource disputes precede much &quot;ethnic conflict&quot;; GATS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other WTO treaties specify water as a tradeable commodity, with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local protectionism being possible. GATS calls the environment &quot;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; service&quot;, to be privately administered.
</em><br>
<p>I've talked to a number of farmers whose wells have dried up because of
<br>
excessive water use by cities, agribusiness and industry. I know of a guy
<br>
who's making a living salvaging windmills from ranches that have been
<br>
abandoned in west Texas as the Oglalla Aquifer has been pumped down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unsustainable  policies are promoted by Big Business. Big farms get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most subsidies and infrastructure benefits.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, and libertarian supporters of Big Business please note that
<br>
this is *not* free enterprise according to its original meaning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The  major parties are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bought out and offer no alternative to ecological collapse.
</em><br>
<p>True. I know this from personal observation as well as what I've read and
<br>
been told.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yet, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all this accelerating destruction there is hope!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50% of the world  still lives in more traditional systems where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy and sustainable agriculture are easily possible. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimal investment in low interest banking, small tools and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permaculture type training, many of these communities could be self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient again.
</em><br>
<p>This is true. As one example, back in October I talked to some guys who were
<br>
using permaculture to reclaim a site in Macedonia that had been used as a
<br>
refugee camp. Not only did they reclaim it--they made it better. The village
<br>
below the camp site had always suffered from floods. The civil engineers who
<br>
did the drainage ditches and roads for the camp had made the flooding
<br>
problem worse, as well as setting up conditions conducive to soil erosion.
<br>
Using swales, the permaculturists stopped the flooding and created basins
<br>
for catching the rich soil washed down from the mountains instead of letting
<br>
it wash into the river. (These people also showed me how to use swales on my
<br>
own land to get through droughts like the one we had last year)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If not propped up by First World aid, oppressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrupt regimes could be toppled by third world people and much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forest, water and mineral wealth be better managed.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, local people are better able to manage their resources than absentee
<br>
landlords.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 10 million South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indian farmers have pledged to  defend their land against genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering. Huge demonstrations in Aisa, South America and India
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against corporate slave labour conditions rarely get  press.
</em><br>
<p>There are several reasons these people are against genetically engineered
<br>
crops, and I'm running out of time so I can't cover all of them. My main
<br>
objection to these crops is that they're designed to work with chemicals and
<br>
excessive amounts of fertilizer (made from petroleum) which end up polluting
<br>
the air and water (and leaving residues in the food as well)
<br>
<p>I'm out of time. Thank you, Greg, for posting the article.
