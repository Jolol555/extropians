I can't say that I agree that 90% of the problem is solved. It's just a
<br>
whole lot harder to see. People know racist jokes aren't acceptable, so
<br>
that don't tell them. Do they still discriminate? Yes, they just never
<br>
admit why. I live in Cincinnati (maybe you've heard of it), and this is a
<br>
very big deal here now. Most whites here don't want to talk about this, and
<br>
most blacks do. Problems abound.

<em>&gt;But, given that ninety percent of the problem has been solved, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the younger generations, the best way to finally damp the problem out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of nonexistence is to avoid saying or doing anything that gives the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impression that you are mentally keeping track of what race a person is.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree here, and think it may just be the people I choose to associate
<br>
with, too. I do know (from my own reading) that there are still certain
<br>
segments of every group who only want to deal with members of their own
<br>
groups. Segregated seating in lunch rooms being one example.

<p><em>&gt;but I'm afraid that this may be true only of the people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I associate with.  I fear that the media is ignoring a certain amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of racism that is alive and well among everyone, not just the young.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>But it's going to happen whether or not you acknowledge the differences.
<br>
Maybe, just maybe, if people can see what they're doing, they'll realize
<br>
how to stop. I don't think this is, largely, a rational well-thought out
<br>
way of living, and to expect people to just &quot;change&quot; is not going to work.
<br>
Unlike Anders, most people are going to identify with whatever group
<br>
they're around and feel comfortable with, then think anyone outside that
<br>
group is somehow suspect.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do wonder, though, whether things like &quot;narrowcasting&quot;, magazines
<br>
devoted to special-interests, cable-tv, the internet, etc. which allow
<br>
people to communicate without really knowing what the other person looks
<br>
like, might be making racial issues obsolete, and replacing them with other
<br>
identifiers, at least in some cases. Then again, I might be applying what
<br>
I've seen too broadly.

<em>&gt;*Yes*.  That's *right*.  Which is why any attempt to track which race a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person is carries its own discrimination-propagating overhead.  It is why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;distinguishing between races in order to stamp out racism has ceased to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be a good tradeoff&quot;.  Let people think of their tribe as &quot;Democratic&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Republican&quot; or &quot;Presbyterian&quot; or &quot;Extropian&quot; or something else that's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free choice of beliefs.
