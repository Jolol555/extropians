Italy's radicals raise clone debate
<br>
<p>Radical Party leader Emma Bonino went on a five day hunger strike

<br>
<p>ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Minority parties in Italy are seeking to raise issues
<br>
largely ignored by mainstream politics in campaigning for this Sunday's
<br>
general election.
<br>
<p>The Radical Party wants to turn the spotlight on euthanasia, therapeutic
<br>
cloning and freedom of scientific research.
<br>
<p>But CNN's Alessio Vinci says these are issues that neither of the two main
<br>
candidates for prime minister have addressed.
<br>
<p>As voting day approaches, Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right House of
<br>
Liberties coalition is maintaining a clear lead in opinion polls over
<br>
Francesco Rutelli's centre-left Olive Tree Alliance.
<br>
<p>The Radical Party, lead by former European Union commissioner Emma Bonino,
<br>
has already successfully campaigned to legalise abortion and divorce in
<br>
Catholic Italy.
<br>
<p>Bonino, in a protest against lack of media access, last week went on a
<br>
five-day hunger strike.
<br>
<p>She said: &quot;Because these are issues that go through all the coalitions, so
<br>
they are very much disturbing.
<br>
<p>&quot;Neither Berlusconi nor Rutelli want to be disturbed. so the expulsion from
<br>
the media of the radicals is simply instrumental.&quot;
<br>
<p>To call more attention to the issue of free scientific research, the Radical
<br>
party is running Luca Coscioni for parliament. He is a former marathon
<br>
runner and university professor who in 1995 developed a severe form of
<br>
sclerosis.
<br>
<p>Coscioni is campaigning for a change to Italy's laws on stem cell research,
<br>
which some scientists believe could speed cures to Parkinson's disease,
<br>
Alzheimer's and even some forms of cancer.
<br>
<p>Stem cell research is currently allowed -- with restrictions -- in much of
<br>
Europe and in the United States, but prohibited in Italy.
<br>
<p>The Radicals position has infuriated the Catholic Church. Monsignor Elio
<br>
Greccia, said: &quot;(It is) the destruction of human embryos.
<br>
<p>&quot;Even if they are used to cure other human individuals, it represents ... a
<br>
murder of human individuals, even if at an embryo phase, and it represents a
<br>
sort of human cannibalism.&quot;
<br>
<p>Right wing parties are attempting to focus on illegal immigration and
<br>
linking it with rising crime.
<br>
<p>The mayor of Altivole in northeastern Italy, Gino Dalese, said: &quot;Six or
<br>
seven years ago, before the immigrants arrived, we had no crime. Now our
<br>
cars get broken into and our houses get burgled.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Silvi Berlusconi feels the heat on the campaign trail
<br>
Rightist national alliance leader Gianfranco Fini has questioned why
<br>
immigrants have to be brought in to fill northern Italy's vacancies when
<br>
unemployment in the south of the country stands at a high 20 percent.
<br>
<p>A United Nations report last year calculated Italy needed to take in nine
<br>
million immigrants over the next 25 years to keep its workforce at a viable
<br>
level.
<br>
<p>Berlusconi's party published its manifesto on Monday, promising tax cuts,
<br>
more jobs and stronger economic growth.
<br>
<p>The 85-page document included pledges to lighten Italy's tax burden by 70
<br>
trillion lire ($32 billion) and create 1.5 million jobs over five years.
<br>
<p>Rutelli's party published its election pledges in April, promising broadly
<br>
similar goals, including tax cuts, tougher law and order and institutional
<br>
reform.
