<p><em>&gt;There are non-Bayesians?  I've never heard of any non-Bayesians or any

</em><br>
<em>&gt;synonym for &quot;normative rationality&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this question hasn't come up for me since the advent of the
<br>
web.  Google to the rescue:
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Probability/bayes02.htm">http://members.tripod.com/~Probability/bayes02.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I quote:
<br>
<p>It seems that thinkers in the field of probability and statistics are
<br>
divided into two armed camps, the Bayeseans and the Non- Bayeseans. The
<br>
fact that such a divsion has existed amongst educated people for over sixty
<br>
years suggests that neither side can clearly be shown to be wrong. When
<br>
prior probabilities are given as data, the Non-Bayesean generally has no
<br>
objection to the use of the Bayes formula, but when prior probabilities are
<br>
lacking he deplores the Bayesean's tendency to make them up out of thin
<br>
air. The Bayesean retorts that the Frequentist methods merely conceal the
<br>
problem instead of solving it, and that he really is the more honest of the
<br>
two. Shouts of joy are heard when, as occasionally happens, a Non-Baysean
<br>
&quot;sees the light&quot; and comes over. There is much celebrating and past sins
<br>
are forgiven. 
<br>
<p>P. G. Hamer describes the schism in these terms: 
<br>
<p>A frequentist uses impeccable logic to answer the wrong question, while a
<br>
Bayesean answers the right question by making assumptions that nobody can
<br>
fully believe in.
<br>
<p>End quote.
<br>
<p>Hey!  Looks like my guess was right:  I was the non-Bayesian
<br>
and you were the Bayesian.  Moreover, we played the roles to
<br>
the hilt.  Further, it looks like the schism is alive and well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Only one question remains:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; (Vorlon voice:) &quot;We are all Bayesian statisticians.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Still one question remains:  Okay, I know the Vorlons are
<br>
from B5.  But this quote rings a bell.  Where else in our
<br>
culture did someone say &quot;We are all X now.&quot; Anybody recall?
