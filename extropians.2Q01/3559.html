<p>I agree with Harvey and Natasha. To insist, as Eliezer did, that suspension 
<br>
are &quot;DEAD&quot; in such universal terms, misses the complexities of the issue. 
<br>
Aside from legal death vs. clinical death vs. biological death vs. 
<br>
informational death, it's worth noting that the term &quot;dead&quot; is ambiguous. 
<br>
In one sense it implies irreversibility. In another sense (&quot;my car engine 
<br>
is dead; I'd better get it fixed&quot;) it does not.
<br>
<p>Since I don't think the following piece is on the Web, I'll include it 
<br>
here. Bear in mind that I wrote it over a decade ago, so it doesn't fully 
<br>
reflect my later thinking. The second link below, to my doctoral 
<br>
dissertation is more recent and much more complete.

IMMORTALIST PHILOSOPHY (January 1991 Cryonics Magazine):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE THIRD STATE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Max More.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wider acceptance of cryonics will require new conceptual 
<br>
categories. As cryonicists it is our responsibility to use terminology and 
<br>
concepts that reflect our understanding of the rationale behind the 
<br>
suspension procedure. Sloppy use of terms will not effectively communicate 
<br>
our ideas to others. Despite Brian Wowk's important article, &quot;The Death of 
<br>
`Death' in Cryonics,&quot; (Cryonics #95, June 1988), too many cryonicists are 
<br>
still using terms like &quot;death&quot; inaccurately. Here I will re-present and 
<br>
build on Brian's suggestion, hopefully reinforcing the point for long-time 
<br>
cryonicists and to explain it to recent participants.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, biological organisms have been classified as either 
<br>
alive or dead. Two basic reasons explain this simple categorization. 
<br>
Firstly, until very recently, when heartbeat and respiration stopped there 
<br>
was no way to return a person to life. It seemed that there was a point 
<br>
beyond which life had permanently ceased and so it was natural to assume 
<br>
that life suddenly turned into death.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, most people have believed in the existence of a 
<br>
non-physical carrier of consciousness and personality. The body was 
<br>
considered merely a vehicle for this &quot;soul&quot;. Again, it seemed natural to 
<br>
understand death as the point at which the soul left the body - a sudden 
<br>
event rather than a gradual process. A dualist (one who believes mind or 
<br>
soul is separate from matter or brain) should really say that though the 
<br>
body dies the person survives in another form. On that view, the exit of 
<br>
the soul is only a physical death, but not the true death of the person.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now know beyond any reasonable doubt that personality is a 
<br>
function of a physical brain process, expressed through an attached 
<br>
physical body. We also now know that the cessation of heartbeat and 
<br>
respiration does not force us to conclude that the person has died. If 
<br>
&quot;death&quot; is to mean the permanent loss of personality, then persons have not 
<br>
died until there is no possibility of recovering their personality.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying can no longer be thought of as a sudden event. Since the 
<br>
personality is encoded in the structure of the brain, dying is a gradual 
<br>
process of degradation in the neural structures embodying personality. The 
<br>
possibility of halting the dying process demands a new term to describe the 
<br>
condition of someone in the stages between the first state of normal 
<br>
conscious function and the second state of death. This Third State (in 
<br>
historical, not logical order) is the condition cryonic suspension patients 
<br>
are in.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, the Third State is a collection of states. 
<br>
Cryonicists have often referred to suspension patients as having 
<br>
&quot;deanimated&quot;, or simply being &quot;in suspension&quot;. I want to offer a set of 
<br>
terms, some already in use, which will clarify the possibilities that lie 
<br>
between life and death.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general term I propose for a person who is in a stable 
<br>
condition between life and death is &quot;inactivate&quot;. I prefer this to 
<br>
&quot;deanimate&quot; for two reasons. (a) &quot;Deanimated&quot; connotes lack of observable 
<br>
movement. People who are not animated in the normal sense may be sleeping, 
<br>
comatose, resting, and so on. Saying they are inactivate more strongly 
<br>
implies that biological activity at the cellular and molecular level has 
<br>
ceased. (b) The movie &quot;Reanimator&quot; has, for some people, produced negative 
<br>
connotations to &quot;reanimation&quot; and &quot;deanimation&quot;. Talk of inactivate, 
<br>
inactivation, deactivating, and reactivating avoids these difficulties.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Inactivate&quot; is a general term subsuming several possibilities, of 
<br>
which cryonic suspension is only one. Since survival of personality 
<br>
involves continuation of a certain functional process, there are several 
<br>
ways of being inactivate that allow for possible future restoration to life 
<br>
and consciousness.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inactivate may mean (a) Biostatic (or &quot;in biostasis&quot;). This means 
<br>
that the person's original body is being preserved with the intention of 
<br>
eventual repair and reactivation. Biostasis itself may take at least three 
<br>
forms: (i) Cryostasis, or cryonic suspension, which is the only method 
<br>
currently used. (ii) Vitrification, in which very low-temperature storage 
<br>
is accomplished without formation of ice crystals. (iii) Various forms of 
<br>
chemical fixation, such as use of cross-linking to prevent biological 
<br>
activity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Inactivate persons might survive in a non-biological form. On 
<br>
a functionalist view, personality persists so long as the same functioning 
<br>
can be restored. This means that personality is to its physical 
<br>
implementation (normally the brain) as software is to hardware. This does 
<br>
not mean that any software can be &quot;run&quot; on any hardware, but it does mean 
<br>
that there may be kinds of hardware other than the brain capable of 
<br>
supporting the kind of functioning that produces personality and 
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the structure of a person's dying brain was throughly analyzed 
<br>
and the information specifying that structure reliably stored, it would be 
<br>
possible in principle to later build a new brain functionally identical to 
<br>
the old one (except for the rejuvenation of the cells). Someone existing in 
<br>
the form of stored information would not be dead, since there has not been 
<br>
an irreversible loss of the information necessary to restore function. If 
<br>
the information is later embodied in a new brain, or uploaded into a 
<br>
suitably designed computer, the personality of the original person would be 
<br>
restored and they would once again be alive.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate following Brian's article, Jerry Leaf and Hugh Hixon 
<br>
rejected Brian's suggestion that we refer to suspension patients as being 
<br>
in an &quot;ametabolic coma&quot; or in an &quot;ischemic coma&quot;, on the grounds that these 
<br>
terms already have defined senses incompatible with our desired usage. 
<br>
Instead then, we can refer to such patients by the general term 
<br>
&quot;inactivate&quot;, or the more specific terms &quot;biostatic/in biostasis&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;cryostatic/in cryostasis,&quot; or simply &quot;suspended&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these terms are applicable to persons who are in the stable 
<br>
third state between life and death. But how should we describe those who 
<br>
are in the process of decay toward death (apart from &quot;in need of 
<br>
suspension&quot;!)? Calling them &quot;partially alive&quot; is misleading since it 
<br>
suggests that certain parts of them are dead. If we describe then as 
<br>
degenerating or deactivating we are accurately stressing the point that 
<br>
they are in the midst of a process that is heading in an undesirable 
<br>
direction. This has the advantage that it implies the possibility of 
<br>
halting the process. Accuracy demands that we reserve the term &quot;dying&quot; for 
<br>
a process that begins some time after degeneration has begun; a person does 
<br>
not begin to die until degeneration has reached the point where information 
<br>
essential to personality functioning is being permanently lost. This 
<br>
happens only after the degenerative process has been proceeding for some time.
