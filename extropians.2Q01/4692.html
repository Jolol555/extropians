</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Singularity has a few different possible alternatives, as far as I am aware.
<br>
<p>- There's the AI path, in which an alien super intelligence comes from a
<br>
self modifying seed.
<br>
<p>- There's the nanotech path, where super nanotech allows us to brute-force
<br>
intelligence by a combination of pure simulation of the human brain+body,
<br>
and some hoopy simulated evolutionary approaches to improving on it (as well
<br>
as just making it a lot faster than a real human brain, by throwing hardware
<br>
at it. This is basically the upload approach.
<br>
<p>- There's the intelligence augmentation approach, where we add things to our
<br>
heads to make ourselves smarter, and those things allow us to conceive more
<br>
mods to make which will make us smarter still, loop. Note that this could be
<br>
biotech/nanotech enhancements, resulting in a purely biological being,
<br>
rather than the traditional cyborg concept.
<br>
<p>I don't think genetic engineering of the kids can lead to singularity in any
<br>
hurry, because of our long generation time (which only looks set to get a
<br>
lot longer). Gene &quot;therapy&quot; on living individuals is another story entirely,
<br>
but that belongs in the category of biotech enhancements.
<br>
<p>Having just been on the telly to talk about how damn great cyborg technology
<br>
would be, I must raise a reservation that I have about it. Particularly, it
<br>
seems to me that it requires either full blown nanotech, or else some pretty
<br>
risky invasive surgical procedures. For the surgical version, the advantages
<br>
would want to be pretty great to attract people to it over the wearable
<br>
alternatives.
<br>
<p>Also, as far as I am aware, we are not even remotely close to understanding
<br>
enough about the brain, that we would want to go in an make mods, except
<br>
where the subject is so screwed up already that there is little to lose. I
<br>
get the impression that we are at least 20 years from the level of
<br>
understanding required to add useful things to our heads. On this subject,
<br>
does anyone know what has been happening with Dr Theodore Berger's research
<br>
of late? There seems to be a lot of relatively old hyped-up press about it,
<br>
then nothing recent. I mention him because, if the press about his work is
<br>
not all bullshit, he is positive about brain modifications (implanting chips
<br>
and whatnot) sometime this decade.
<br>
<p>So, I'd have said that we were still a long way from mental mods, and that
<br>
most less tightly integrated modifications would have safer wearable
<br>
versions which would be available before the full-blown cyborg options.
<br>
<p>And, if we have to wait for nanotech before we can do really hoopy mental
<br>
modifications, we'll well and truly be in a post biotech revolution world
<br>
where there are already some mindblowing things that we can do without
<br>
adding non-biological stuff to ourselves.
<br>
<p>So is it likely that we will have socially significant cyborg tech in the
<br>
next few decades? If it is possible sooner rather than later, the enabling
<br>
technologies would appear to lead to singularity in any case, and past that
<br>
point you start talking about SIs and posthumans rather than cyborgs. If it
<br>
takes longer, either we still have technological singularity upon us before
<br>
we can really get started on cyborg tech (because we are relying on nanotech
<br>
&amp; godawlmity computational resources), or else we've had a long time to
<br>
develop wearables that do just about anything we'd want to do, without
<br>
having to crack the skull.
<br>
<p>I feel as though it's going to be one of those ideas which is a driver now,
<br>
but might look a bit embarrassing 20 years down the track... very Jetsons.
