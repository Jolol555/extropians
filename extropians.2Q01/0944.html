<p>Oh my god, Anders is actually inventing another boondogle
<br>
that requires *people* to do the work!  I explained how this
<br>
should be done in my previous (somewhat lengthy) post from
<br>
a week ago or so.  You do it with microsats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The crew will have to spend a long time in microgravity; I have been

<p>Why don't you just have the biotech engineers come up with a drug that
<br>
simulates the stress-signals produced by gravity (or amplifies those
<br>
produced naturally, so you can cut the treadmill time down to something
<br>
reasonable).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The business plan is rather long-range and mainly interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building the industrial infrastructure needed for large scale habitat
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; within 20 years of the start of the operation, due to external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors).
</em><br>
<p>Long range business plans can only be financed by very rich people.
<br>
VC &amp; Investment bankers wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole.
<br>
You can of course wait until 20 years when a new generation of
<br>
hot-shots thinks they know everything and buy into the stupidest stuff
<br>
(The marketing plan for Iridium must now be a B-school classic.)
