<em>&gt; What say ye, Sir Robert?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Good question.  If you think it will work then I'm willing to accept it.
<br>
<p>The comments from Anders seem to indicate the material strength problems
<br>
are resolvable.  I had devoted some thought to this when I was thinking
<br>
about the MBrain internode communication.  A lot of my thinking was
<br>
driven by cross-sphere long distance laser communications (as Anders
<br>
proposed with the Dyson-Net(Web) solar sail design).  In my current
<br>
calculations I only do nearest neighbor communications calculations
<br>
to avoid the photon losses due to beam spreading.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I thought that materials requirements would be too high for
<br>
fibers and/or perhaps I thought you would need the satellites to
<br>
be &quot;independent&quot; to allow them to make orbital adjustments to
<br>
compensate for specific forces that would impact them (from
<br>
coronal mass ejections for example).
<br>
<p>But I've done some work on the bandwidth of fibers for the brain-computer
<br>
uplink and current/near-future transmission &amp; reception capabilities
<br>
and I think this idea needs serious consideration.
<br>
<p>I can imagine that you could put the fiber on rapid spool reels
<br>
that would allow you to maintain a constant tension on the fibers
<br>
that is within their material limits (kind of like what they must
<br>
use to lay submarine cables).  I think current fibers of around
<br>
100-200 microns perhaps coated in buckytube cladding would be the
<br>
way to go.
<br>
<p>I'll have to think about the relative photon losses in the fibers
<br>
vs. free vacuum.  You do have the advantage with open space comm.
<br>
that you can move up to UV-lasers.  Currently you can't go there
<br>
in regular fibers.  Perhaps you use free-space to carry UV signals
<br>
across the long-distance links and fiber to carry Visible and IR
<br>
across the local connections.
<br>
<p>The real &quot;trick&quot; is going to be finding ways to recycle the energy
<br>
contained in the photons.  You would like to be able to pick up
<br>
the photons extract the information they contain and then use then
<br>
reuse the energy in an outgoing stream.  The best lasers currently
<br>
are ~63%+ efficient, and the best CCD detectors are around 99%
<br>
for some frequencies.  But you pass those photons around through
<br>
millions of nodes and your losses are going to add up pretty quickly.
<br>
<p>You also have to move to single photon transmission &amp; reception of
<br>
the bits.  With current transmission technologies, the energy
<br>
value of the circulating photons of an MBrain are a sizeable
<br>
fraction of the power output of the sun.
