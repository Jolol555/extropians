<p>I would love to agree with you.  But for about the last 12
<br>
years I have been unable to see how they can be the same
<br>
thing, unless I take the extreme step and deny that I myself
<br>
am conscious.  And believe me, it's very aggravating to have
<br>
to infer something about a relatively hard and fast concept
<br>
like &quot;calculation&quot; or &quot;computation&quot;, from a shaky subjective
<br>
one like &quot;consciousness&quot;!
<br>
<p>But so far as I can see, we are forced to.  Here is why: if
<br>
we suppose not, then (a) your last 5 minutes of conscious
<br>
experience is equivalent to the right program going through
<br>
a few billion states on the cpu or biological organism of
<br>
your choice.  (So far few on extropians would disagree.)
<br>
<p>Next, that is equivalent, in turn, to a big lookup table.
<br>
(see my post yesterday of &quot;going on a hike with Eugene
<br>
Leitl&quot; for a complete description).  That is, no information
<br>
flows between states!  They are not linked by a cause and
<br>
effect chain!  At each second of the hike, or of your own
<br>
last 5 minutes conscious experience, we merely form a 30
<br>
bit address made from (i) 10 bits of input that you are
<br>
getting at the current millisecond (ii) 20 bits specifying
<br>
the state that you are in.
<br>
<p>(Now it is that last step which I have been forced to 
<br>
conclude is where the error in all this is!)
<br>
<p>Next, the billions of states making up your last 5 minutes
<br>
being looked up in sequence is equivalent to them being
<br>
looked up in any order.  What difference does it make if
<br>
they are rearranged?  (Greg Egan did a fairly good job
<br>
describing this in the second chapter of Permutation City,
<br>
only, unaccountably, he had the intelligent protagonist,
<br>
Paul Durham, having trouble understanding that it HAD TO
<br>
BE EXACTLY the same, no matter what objective order he
<br>
was run in.)
<br>
<p>Next, this is exactly equivalent, as I think Robert
<br>
Bradbury was getting at earlier, to having all the
<br>
billions of state simply encoded in one long string. 
<br>
Then I ask, why do they actually have to be fetched?
<br>
<p>And this is exactly where Egan finally went, with the
<br>
ludicrous Theory of Dust.  Unless you balk at SOME step
<br>
above---I balk that lookups USED EXTENSIVELY AND SOLELY
<br>
are computation, at least the kind of computation that
<br>
supports consciousness---they you are led directly to
<br>
the ludicrous Theory of Dust.  Thanks to Jim Fehlinger
<br>
for supplying the most devastating rejoinder I ever saw
<br>
at  &gt; &quot;Dust: Why I Don't Believe It', Susan Stepney:

<br>
If I and those that agree with me are right, then this
<br>
is a marvelous thing:  somehow (a) the cause and effect,
<br>
(b) the information flow across time, are essential for
<br>
calculations to be conscious.  I know it sounds crazy,
<br>
but for more than ten years I've seen utterly no escape.
