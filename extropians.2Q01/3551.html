</em><br>
<p>Really?  Dozens of teams all working full-spped on creating
<br>
human-competitive machine intelligence?  Across the board?  Strong AI? 
<br>
Or just competitive in some delimited problem area or another like
<br>
playing chess?
<br>
<p>If it is strong AI, creating a self aware, human competitive general
<br>
intelligence that you are talking about then please give references to
<br>
these groups and their work.  This would be very interesting indeed.
