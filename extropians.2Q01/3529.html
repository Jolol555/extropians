<p>&quot;Maria was close to despair.  He was her one link to the old
<br>
world; without him, her memories would lose all meaning...
<br>
<p>He shook his head sadly.  'Maria, I'm sorry -- I can't follow
<br>
you...   All my certainties have evaporated.  Do you know
<br>
how that feels?'
<br>
<p>Maria met his eyes and tried to understand, tried to gauge the
<br>
depth of his weariness...  Maybe the time came, for everyone,
<br>
when there was no way forward, no other choice but death...
<br>
<p>Maria turned on him angrily.  'Do I know how it feels?  **However
<br>
you want it to feel.**  Isn't that what you told me?  You
<br>
have the power to choose exactly **who you are**.  The old
<br>
human shackles are gone...  If you really want to die, I can't
<br>
stop you -- but don't tell me that **you have no choice**...'
<br>
<p>He said gently, 'You really do need someone, don't you, who
<br>
knows the old world?'
<br>
<p>'Yes.'  Maria blinked back tears...
<br>
<p>He said 'I'll come with you...'
<br>
<p>He beamed at her, like an idiot, like a child.  'I just made
<br>
a few adjustments to my mental state.  And I accept your
<br>
invitation.  **Onward and upward**...'
<br>
<p>Maria stopped dead.  If he'd rebuilt himself, reinvented
<br>
himself . . . **then how much of the man she'd known remained**?
<br>
Had he granted himself transhuman resilience, and healed himself
<br>
of his terminal despair . . . or had he died in silence,
<br>
beyond her sight, and given birth to a companion for her,
<br>
a software child who'd merely inherited its father's memories?
<br>
<p>**Where was the line**?  Between self-transformation so great
<br>
as to turn a longing for death into childlike wonder . . . and
<br>
death itself, and the handing on of the joys and burdens he
<br>
could no longer shoulder to someone new?...
<br>
<p>She said, 'You must tell me what you did.  I need to
<br>
understand.'
<br>
<p>Durham promised her, 'I will.  In the next life.'&quot;
