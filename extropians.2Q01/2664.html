<p><em>&gt;I even find von Mises definition a bit problematic.  Granted, it's closer to

<p>Well, I think they're both understandable and useful definitions, but of
<br>
two different things; although, I suppose, you could make sure &quot;area of
<br>
production&quot; is interpreted broadly enough that every such restriction
<br>
results in the situation Mises describes.  Rothbard's definition would
<br>
certainly exclude copyrights and (at least most) patents, since these cover
<br>
highly specific types of product.  Mises' definition leaves that open;
<br>
whether a publisher could profit by restricting supply would essentially
<br>
depend upon the substitutability of other books or even non-book goods.

<p><em>&gt;I think this problem is not restricted to Left-anarchists.  It's a much

<em>&gt;wider problem with the way some look at all sorts of activities...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The problem with this view is that it looks at economics (and property and

</em><br>
<em>&gt;disregards the mind and its place in the economy.
</em><br>
<p>That last sentence, although it evokes wonderfully grandiose Galtian images
<br>
in my mind, is going a bit too far.  Rich doctors or scientists don't
<br>
receive the brunt of this disdain, nor even do filthy rich actors or
<br>
athletes.  (Is an athlete closer to manual labor or mind?)  Anyway, it's
<br>
not the mind per se that most people don't intuitively appreciate; it's
<br>
only one particular economic function of the mind, the allocation of
<br>
resources according to the information of prices.  As Mr. Gunnell has
<br>
recently quoted:
<br>
<p>&quot;Notice also that Nozick confuses exchange with
<br>
capitalism (&quot;I offer you a lecture once a week in
<br>
exchange for other things&quot;). This is a telling mistake
<br>
by someone who claims to be an expert on capitalism,
<br>
because the defining feature of capitalism is not
<br>
exchange (which obviously took place long before
<br>
capitalism existed) but labor contracts involving
<br>
capitalist middlemen who appropriate a portion of the
<br>
value produced by workers - in other words, wage
<br>
labour. Nozick's example is merely a direct labor
<br>
contract between the producer and the consumer. It
<br>
does not involve any capitalist intermediary taking a
<br>
percentage of the value created by the producer.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thus, although the brain surgeon might be wealthier and use his mind more
<br>
than most employees of the HMO, only the latter are considered agents of
<br>
exploitation, because it's not superficially obvious what value they
<br>
create.  This point was repeatedly emphasized by my economically brain-dead
<br>
sociology prof when we covered Marx.  Apparently, union lawyers (but not
<br>
corporate) are also producers of value.  Go figure.
