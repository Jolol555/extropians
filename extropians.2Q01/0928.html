<p><em>&gt; That may be part of it, but consider drama as an art form.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Many who have attempted playing roles in a drama really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  appreciate well-done acting.  Consider a movie which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  recommended to several friends, who all pretty much hated it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  As Good As It Gets, with Jack Nicholson, Greg Kinnear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Helen Hunt.  Its a dark comedy {as is life, eh?} but the acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the three  main characters is terrific.  Even if the story is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  dark, a tragedy in a way, the acting alone makes it worth it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in that case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  As Good As It Gets fans, comment?
</em><br>
<p>That is one of the absolute numero uno favorite movies of all time in our 
<br>
household and has at times become a kind of &quot;video wallpaper&quot; around here -- 
<br>
if I added up all partial viewings, I may have seen it more than 20 times.  I 
<br>
also happen to think that it is a deeply extropian film:
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---- SPOILER WARNING ----
<br>
<p><p>The basic theme of the film is about overcoming limits and finding and 
<br>
creating meaning in a chaotic world.  At the heart of two of the characters' 
<br>
transformations lie some technological tools.  Consider that Nicholson's 
<br>
character has to embrace the technology of the drugs he's been prescribed in 
<br>
order to transcend the self-imposed limits his obsessive-compulsive disorder 
<br>
has brought him to construct as a defense to his biologically-caused lack of 
<br>
coping mechanisms.  Helen Hunt's character is freed from a kind of slavery to 
<br>
her child's illness through the intervention of medical science, but still 
<br>
has to take the initiative to break out of the emotional shell she's created 
<br>
around herself because of that history.  Greg Kinnear's character ends up 
<br>
being libaerated by a willingness to see Nicholson's through new eyes; not a 
<br>
technologically-mediated transformation, but nevertheless one that involves 
<br>
the kind of neophilia that extropians espouse.
<br>
<p>On top of all this, I agree with you, Spike, that this film has some of the 
<br>
best acting, writing and directing you can find in any film made in the last 
<br>
ten years.  It also has some incredibly funny lines that have become 
<br>
catch-phrases for Anthea and me.  &quot;No, and I'm also not going to let you 
<br>
inject me with the plague&quot; is now a standard way we reject proposals in our 
<br>
house.
<br>
<p>A definite thumbs-up!
