From: Chuck Kuecker &lt;<a href="mailto:ckuecker@mcs.net?Subject=Re:%20Made%20in%20China&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104171411.HAA05729@well.com&gt;">ckuecker@mcs.net</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;I have wondered for quite a while, just how boycotting &quot;exploited&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people's  goods, say, Nike shoes, because they are made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;underpaid&quot; children, is a good thing for us to do.
</em><br>
<p>You find exploited child labor acceptable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ditto &quot;sweatshops&quot;. If the choice is between a twelve hour work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shift six days a week, and starvation, I would gladly work those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hours. ( I tend to do this anyway, but then, I am my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;exploiter&quot;!)
</em><br>
<p>For a pittance of a wage and a great deal of abuse? I doubt your
<br>
case is even remotely applicable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even though these children are &quot;exploited&quot; by the standards of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;America, they may well be the difference between their familys'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survival and slow death by starvation. Unless the boycotters are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;willing to pay the now unemployed kids' families the difference,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they may be causing more suffering than they are curing.
</em><br>
<p>The fact that they have little choice doesnt make it right. By
<br>
purchasing these goods you are ethically the same as the sweatshop
<br>
boss who mistreats these children.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;Exploitation&quot; of a country's citizens is the province of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country's citizens and government. Unless you advocate that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invade, overthrow, and magically raise the standards of living in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all impoverished areas, anyway.
</em><br>
<p>That would make me the jingoist Hal's accusing me of being. To buy
<br>
these goods is to make yourself the ethical partner of those who do
<br>
the exploiting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The Western world has enforced a blockade of Iraq for quite a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years now, supposedly to &quot;punish&quot; Saddam Hussein for his invasion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Kuwait and other antisocial acts. He is still comfortably in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power, but millions of innocent Iraqis have suffered and died
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because of the blockade.
</em><br>
<p>Bad plan, back to the subject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we invest in third world countries and help them develop an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;industrial  base, they will ultimately take care of their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;internal problems in their own way. This is the Libertarian way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;handling these problems. US citizens buying products made in third
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world countries does not in any way affect the freedoms of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workers.
</em><br>
<p>When you buy the output of a sweatshop, you are not &quot;investing&quot; in
<br>
the third world.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There is one glaring exception to this rule. If the country in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question (China?) uses SLAVE labor, then a boycott will not hurt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the workers any more than buying the goods would, since they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not see any profits whatever from sales, unlike &quot;exploited&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workers. I consciously try not to buy Chinese goods because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this, at least until I see good evidence that there is no forced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;labor involved.
</em><br>
<p>Good for you, now make the connection, children who are forced to
<br>
work in sweatshops or starve are slaves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Underpaid workers have the options of forming unions, going on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strike, or just quitting, just like they do here. Slave workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have none of these options.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me? Read the history books, those who've tried to form
<br>
unions have been killed in droves. Children forced to work in
<br>
sweatshops are slaves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A useful thing would be a chart showing the labor practices of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;various countries. If there is government coercion involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;labor, then I would consider a boycott of that country's goods. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the workers are paid the local going wage, let's help them by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keeping their employment opportunities open.
</em><br>
<p>Travas has posted some excellent links.
<br>
<p>Lets draw a distinction here, there is a BIG difference between
<br>
workers producing things in various countries at various wages and
<br>
the output of sweatshops, especially those who use child labor.
