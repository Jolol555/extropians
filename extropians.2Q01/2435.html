Friends,
<br>
<p>I was just ready to schedule the date of May 19th, as this was a date most
<br>
could attend, however I am rescheduling it to July or August.  Since it has
<br>
been many months since some of us discussed having an event and a tribute
<br>
to FM-2030, a few more months will seem like nano-seconds when considering
<br>
a larger picture.
<br>
<p>My reason for rescheduling is two-fold. First, I had a scheduling overload
<br>
for the month of May and  the theater I had planned to book is now
<br>
unavailable.  For these two reasons, it seemed best to simply move it to
<br>
another month. 
<br>
<p>Please let me know if July/August is a good time, and preferential dates
<br>
for you. 
<br>
<p>The beauty of designing an event is in the coalescing of ideas.
<br>
<p>Dream to dare!
<br>
<p>Natasha

<p><p>&quot;I plan to host a transhuman event in LA this summer.  There are various
<br>
reasons for producing the event:  Getting the many groups of transhumans
<br>
together; (2) discussing the opposition to our views on technologies and
<br>
the potential ideological conflicts; (3) honoring FM-2030; (4) discussing
<br>
new ways to deal with the impact our culture is having on society; and (5)
<br>
an extropic exchange of creative and inventive ideas about our future.&quot;
