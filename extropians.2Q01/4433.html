will
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Exhibit A, I'd be happy to represent a more rounded view, informed by
</em><br>
others
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;onlist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;- Killer app 1: Life extension... This application will really pull
</em><br>
&quot;cyborg
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;technology&quot; into mainstream culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might consider using percentages:  For example, 25% of Australian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population already has had an augmentation to their bodies.  5% now use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robotic arms or legs; 10% have received pacemakers; %3 percent IUDs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (There are arbitrary, but I think you could get some solid facts which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be persuasive in your introduction to augmentations.)
</em><br>
<p>I read a book called &quot;Communicating Science&quot; which said that this was
<br>
actually not so important on TV... TV likes vague generalisations +
<br>
passionate delivery. The classic concept is that accuracy and clarity move
<br>
in an inverse relationship on the box.
<br>
<p>I'm very good with handwaving and broad brush opinions masquerading as
<br>
&quot;Fact&quot;, so I'll probably steer clear of garish numbers as far as possible. A
<br>
nice one is that 10% of americans are cyborgs when you look at drug feed
<br>
implants, pacemakers, articifical joints, articificial skin, etc. It must be
<br>
true, I read it on the web somewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;who delve into these areas... HRT is a great example. These people will
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;label themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HRT is a different augmentation - a chemical augment to monitor female
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hormones to prevent the onslaught of menopause.  You could suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the mind is augmented by ingesting certain hormones to regulate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemistry of our bodies for a more healthy and vital life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>HRT is supposed to extend life, though, as a side effect (cool side effect).
<br>
Drugs may well count as cyber enhancements too... anyone got an opinion on
<br>
that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;- Killer app 2: N
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Killer app 3: Eternal youth and the beauty industry..y
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what form it takes... Brad Pitt/Nicole Kidman?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about the man who stared in The X Men?  Isn't he Aussi?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here you could mention how reversing aging has been on the cover of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magazines, Time, Newsweek, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hugh Jackman, yup, an Aussie. There's a lot of that going around - I say
<br>
this having just watched Elizabeth. All your base are belong to us.
<br>
<p>I like the bit about it being on the covers of publications, good stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Whatever the exact form is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it apparently doesn't have wrinkles, cellulite or body hair. It can, on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;other hand, have breast implants, a face lift or a nose job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nose lift = rhinoplasty.
</em><br>
<p>Calling it rhinoplasty... that's just rubbing it in, isn't it? Like calling
<br>
permanent hair removal a &quot;Gorillaectomy&quot;, or liposuction a &quot;DeElefantation&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There will be a strong overlap between life extension technologies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;beauty related technologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might want to consider mentioning that the concept of beauty has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed over the eons, from Cleopatra to a Rubenesque figure to Twiggy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the athletic bodies of today.  Beauty today is viewed as not just a symbol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a perfect face, but also a healthy physique and attitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the years to come, we will be able to regulate the body to adjust any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dryness of skin, wrinkling caused from sun damage (important to mention in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia) and aging.  To reverse the onslaught of aging we will see less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and less cosmetic surgery and more genetic engineering and biotechnology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The genes that cause our minds and bodies to age more rapidly than our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to grow older will be reversed and we will see a more youthful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young-old generation ahead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The concept of beauty will change over the years and what is considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful today may not be beautiful tomorrow.  When we can alter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color, tone and texture of our skin, alter our voices to express our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions with a harmonious reverberation, develop our eyes to see great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distances (etc.), beauty as we see it today might seem flat and
</em><br>
unexciting.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Consider your audience - you don't want to freak them out too much, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do want to give them some facts about what will occur.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>ok, thanks for all that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;So, as our technology for self modification improves, and we can more
</em><br>
easily
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hit the mark, the beauty industry will move the target. There are some
</em><br>
great
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stats out there (The Beauty Myth contains some decent research) to show
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the &quot;ideal woman&quot;, for example, is a physically impossible being already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;When we add cyborg technology to the mix, where will the collective ideal
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the perfect form move to? Somewhere as odd as it is extreme, and it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;motivate ever larger uptake of the sillier forms of cyborg technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I't too bad they are using the term &quot;cyborg&quot;.  It's so metal sounding and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes me think of Warwick.  You want to take this opportunity to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welcoming of humanity and compassionate to why people want to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful (both men and women).  If _Aristoi_ is a wonderful example of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beauty in the future for both genders.  I get a little toasted when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking of old world concepts of beauty and tagging this to women as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is what our lives are about.  I have always said, &quot;Beauty is a 12
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letter word - &quot;intelligence.&quot;  The most beautiful people are those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspire to achieve their dreams, are vital and expressive.  Not all are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty faces, but inspire us and allure us.  Even Cleopatra was considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an idol, yet she was not so physically beautiful at all.
</em><br>
<p>Well, indeed. I'm afraid I can't get too excited about enhancements that are
<br>
all about aesthetic stuff... there are just too many important things that
<br>
need doing first. Like getting past dying young, for a start.
<br>
<p>However, I do recognise that money will end up in life extension fields by
<br>
way of the beauty industry. Also, I understand that I am a weird geekoid,
<br>
and may not necessarily represent the average citizen :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, you could introduce the idea of enhancing &quot;beauty in the eye of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beholder&quot; by saying we can tweak our visual recognition patters to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highlight facial qualities that we like and reduce those that we find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unappealiang.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ugly detector... yes, that would be amusing. Also, it raises some
<br>
interesting questions. Why bother to look after your physical appearance at
<br>
all, if people will, for the most part, repaint you as they desire in their
<br>
mind's digital eye?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;- Physical enhancements... In the cyberpunk literature, people tend to
</em><br>
make
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;very silly modifications, so that they can look freaky, or have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enhanced physical trait. Steve Austin, eat your heart out. However, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;believe that these will be the very last types of enhancements that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;made, and the least frequent. In the world of today, and certainly in
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of tomorrow, physical enhancements are and become less useful than one
</em><br>
might
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suppose. Leap tall buildings in a single bound? Sure... but why not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;take the lift? It might not turn out to be very important to a modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;westerner to be able to lift a small truck; it might be far more useful
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;merely look as though you could.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Eventually physical enhancements will become more important, as our
</em><br>
biology
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;begins to really let us down... we may need to change form to cope with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;overcrowding of earth, we'll definitely need to change form to explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;space. That, however, is some way off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could mention Dennis Tito the space tourist and that when we reside in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space we will have different environment to cope with and we will need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the consequences of space and how to protect our bodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;e. Babbage could see the computer, daVinci
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;could see human flight, Jules Verne could see space travel. We can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transhumanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we are transhumanity.   We can see a time when disease is a thing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past, when the pollution is no longer an issue, etc.. (You don't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sound too Pollyannaish for your audience, but you do want to offer them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a vision of the future.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;ponder ponder&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This whole discussion of mine probably looks hopelessly ill-informed to
</em><br>
many
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of you... so tell me why. What's important that I've missed? Where am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;wrong? Where is my presentation flawed? Don't quietly grumble about it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;yourself... if you can correct my misinformation, then I'm less likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;say something problematic on the box.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's really quite good Emlyn.  Most people want soundbytes on television,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not lengthy discourse.  You might want to pick a one-liner for each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category you will be discussing and be as succinct as possible.  Offer
</em><br>
your
<br>
<em>&gt; audience some facts or percentages and remember this may be new to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>ok
<br>
