<p>How would I know? Ask Kurzweil, Eliezer, or that Goertzel person. I'm only
<br>
interested in incremental patches to the human condition. (Btw, if you
<br>
ever do find out the technical support contact for the First Cause, please
<br>
let me know, as I have a long list of bug reports to file myself.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At the moment.  I'm not inclined to believe it's inherent, until we

</em><br>
<p>Well, it's a mess. Whatever it tells us, it doesn't tell us how to build
<br>
cold, hard, clean designs, to appeal to the inner anal-retentive in us. If
<br>
anything, it tells us that stupid design by mess can come a great long
<br>
way, and is still going strong, since doesn't seem having obvious scaling
<br>
limitations. It might be not the best way do it in the long run, but I'm
<br>
content with hacking an existing system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Godelian-flavoured intrinsic system limitation. As I said, I'm looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what's the system?  We're too limited to design Pentium's unaided.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fortunately we're aided.
</em><br>
<p>If anything, x86s teach us that large number of people using rational
<br>
means of design instead of noise-driven methods perform very badly. You
<br>
can only navigate in search space if you've got a very good map of said
<br>
space already. If you don't have that (at least somebody missed to give me
<br>
a copy), it's good old seat of your pants (a mix of brute force and bias,
<br>
while furiously sniffing for real or imagined gradients in the breeze).
<br>
<p>It would be interesting to know inasmuch CPU designers are using GA for
<br>
block layout optimization, and whether statistical optimization methods
<br>
are being used at below block level.
<br>
<p>It would be very interesting to use GA to directly mutate substrate
<br>
structure in the physics simulator, when breeding hardware CAs. Because
<br>
the cells are so simple, even the bitspray would probably find something
<br>
cool, utilizing dirt effects which human designers are not even aware of.
<br>
Doing waferscale hardware CA the VHDL way would seem to losing a lot of
<br>
performance. Heck, even a single Chuck can make a design go places people
<br>
never thought were possible in a given process, by tweaking the size of a
<br>
few (literally) hot spot transistors. Pentiums, shmentiums.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also doubt an evolved AI would lead to Singularity.  Say we evolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one -- which may not be that easy, given how tortuous the path to us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems -- then what?  We've got a cryptic mess of intelligent code.
</em><br>
<p>We've got a cryptic mess of intelligent code hacking itself, and the
<br>
hardware it runs on. A large population of the darn things, actually.
<br>
They'll probably be terrific physicists, because a lot of physics is
<br>
symbol manipulation, and monkeys are lousy at symbol manipulation, since
<br>
not evolved to do that well. They'll be awesome hardware hackers, too,
<br>
because coordination and control is expensive, and they're not subject to
<br>
energy and footprint constraints of biology legacy (another cubic mile of
<br>
substrate? Here you go). If you want to manipulate stuff at molecular
<br>
resolution, you need lots of fingers, and damn fast reflexes.
<br>
<p>I other words, even rampant anthopocentrism can't prevent us from
<br>
glimpsing hints that we'd first become side players, and then rapidly
<br>
(very rapidly) diminishing points in the landscape, visibly shifting into
<br>
deep infrared and then microwave as the cruise is picking up speed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's more amenable to controlled experiments and eventualy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modification thatn we are, but still pretty abstruse as far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-modification -- the core Singularity path -- goes.  The fun stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens if the AI has coherent high level structure, so mutations have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large effect, and design space gets explored quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I'd avoid this fetishism of low-level evolutionary processes.
</em><br>
<p>The world *is* made from nails. Look, if you disagree, I have this neat
<br>
little argument here, to pound my point home...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's all Darwinism ultimately, from gene mutations to high level
</em><br>
<p>See, that's much better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; thoughts.  But a child learning chess may try to move anywhere, and be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swatted away from illegal moves.  A chess program only explores legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moves.  A human grandmaster only explores good moves.  If she gets
</em><br>
<p>I have no idea what a human grandmaster explores, actually. (As opposed to
<br>
what he tells us he thinks he's exploring). I would like to see an fMRI of
<br>
his brain while he's playing. Of course I expect a very good parallel
<br>
pattern matcher hybridized with a large position library, which would not
<br>
up light up an awful lot. But pretty much everywhere. I would not be
<br>
surprised to see a little Edelman neural darwinism for a little parallism
<br>
to drive it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; stuck, then she can try relaxing constraints (although going down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic mutations to develop better chess players is kind of breaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the example.)  But that's the last resort, not the first.
</em><br>
<p>If I would want to develop a good chessplayer, I would start with an GA
<br>
ANN (which I would have to learn how to mutate first, of course), with an
<br>
8x8 chess board as retina input, and do many, many coevolutionary rounds
<br>
on a large population of virtual players playing against each other.
<br>
Occasionally plugging algorithmic and human chess opponents would be fun,
<br>
too. Of course we don't have the hardware nor can we do GA ANNs, so the
<br>
question is moot.
