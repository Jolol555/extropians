</em><br>
<p>#I'll give you a big part of it right here: They're opposed to the 
<br>
artificial creation of life for the express purpose of profit or 
<br>
experimentation/torture or spare parts. As am I--for which I've 
<br>
recently been labeled a neoludd, moron, technophobe, etc. etc. 
<br>
(really quite an entertaining accusation, but I digress...). Were I 
<br>
these things, I'd support this bill, which I do not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This sort of thing serves as a reminder that what we take as obvious, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; majority of people think is ~really far out there~.
</em><br>
<p>#Glad to see someone realizes this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also a sign that we need to make more inroads in mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking. It is not enough for people to have heard of nanotechnology or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even know what it is, they better be able to integrate it with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical discourse. 
</em><br>
<p>#Couldn't agree more--yet when morality/ethics issues are raised 
<br>
here, they are ignored at best, dismissed or ridiculed at worst. 'Tis 
<br>
troubling, to say the least. The term &quot;techno-cheerleader&quot; (coined 
<br>
by..?) is not at all inappropriate.
<br>
<p>#There is ***in general*** no sense of balance, of restraint, of 
<br>
forethought, caution, or consideration of consequences. Pointing this 
<br>
out draws ad hominem attacks--first refuge of those unable to support 
<br>
their positions with reason.
<br>
<p>#It would be very easy to do a dismissive writeup on the movement, 
<br>
presenting the views of the most hotheaded and vocal individuals as 
<br>
being typical and representative (taking great care to note their 
<br>
affiliations), and print it somewhere prominent. I would not do such 
<br>
a thing--both because it would (I hope) be inaccurate and also 
<br>
because I agree with many of the concepts espoused by transhumanism--
<br>
but others may well.
<br>
<p>#Transhumanists themselves do their cause far more damage than any 
<br>
neoluddite opponent could hope to manage. This was the meaning of my 
<br>
&quot;not ready for prime time&quot; comment. The general observations made 
<br>
with that comment explain why. The Principles and the practice do not 
<br>
coincide. As I said then, this is a pity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The way to fight this is to deal with the underlying memes that make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people make this kind of silly decision. We need to show why our pet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects are not just beneficial but ethical, and why banning them would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be both impractical and immoral. 
</em><br>
<p>#Excellent suggestion--and sites such as yours provide an excellent 
<br>
resource for those interested in or new to TH.
