<em>&gt; Mead's influence within anthropology was immense.  It was Mead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who gave almost limitless credibility to Franz Boas' whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program of repudiating every 19th century belief about society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and anthropology that he could.  For all the evils of 19th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century views, Boas and Mead went way too in the other direction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially in causing entire abandonment of the very idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a &quot;human nature&quot;.  Only in the last two decades of the

</em><br>

<p>Looks like the war rages on, Ben.  There still seems to be a fairly large
<br>
disparity between the group that thinks that Mead was at most a minor
<br>
nuisance, or perhaps a good researcher who moved the social sciences in
<br>
the right direction despite her minor foibles, and the group that thinks
<br>
that Mead managed to do almost as much damage as Marx.
<br>
<p>I'd like to just say, for the record, that a lot of ideas - my passionate
<br>
denouncements to be specific - would pass as normal in the hardcore
<br>
ev-psych community.  Likewise, my ideas on altruism would pass for mundane
<br>
among most Eastern philosophies.  But remember this:  I USE A DVORAK
<br>
KEYBOARD.  My strange allegiances are not random, though I've accumulated
<br>
enough of them that at least some of my opinions will be out of place in
<br>
any one community.  I am more than an iconoclast:  I am the Iconoclast of
<br>
the Better Way.
