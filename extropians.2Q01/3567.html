</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [Sigh] The time and opportunity to change it many times, to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [That's more like it!]  I am not limited to my personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [Whatever...]   I do not necessarily believe that even my
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I&quot;, is invariant or deserving of being preserved indefinitely...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may or may not be invariant, but that has little to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it &quot;deserving&quot; to be preserved.  Does an obscure type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ant in the Amazon jungle &quot;deserve&quot; to have its pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recorded for all time?  Most people today would say yes.
</em><br>
<p>Deserving is not the right question.  If it is of value to other 
<br>
sentients sufficiently and the cost of its preservation is low
<br>
enough relative to its value then it will be preserved.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Well, I'd say that the pattern of Samantha Atkins is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10^7 times as important to preserve.  Where the hell does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this concept of &quot;deserve&quot; come from anyway?  It almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds as though one's &quot;worthiness&quot; were being evaluated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the Almighty, or by some similarly transcended creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (perhaps the AI you're working on).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What I meant by my comment above is that I don't consider this
<br>
particular
<br>
bundle of personality traits, memories, impulses, desires, cares and
<br>
so on as something that I am that driven to preserve indefinitely.  I
<br>
am driven to preserve the capacity to be, to learn, to know and to
<br>
continuously
<br>
recreate beingness, valuing, enjoyment, learning and so on.  To me it is 
<br>
a difference between the packaging and the contents if you will. 
<br>
<p>I certainly hope to chuck a lot of the meat packaging some day and along
<br>
with
<br>
it a lot of attitudes and proclivities and limitations that came from
<br>
and are
<br>
bound up in this here flesh.  Does that mean that *I* ended or did *I*
<br>
change packaging,
<br>
leaving the old package behind like a discarded torn party dress of
<br>
yesteryear?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I&quot; over time would change in ways that would seem very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;not-I&quot; today. Even this concept of &quot;me&quot; as distinct from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;others&quot; in quite this way is open to change and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modification given time enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But watch out.  If you evolve into something that on objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounds is not-Samantha, then unless you've arranged that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earlier versions of you get ample run time, you'll be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead.  Please don't let that happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why would I want to avoid  evolving to where one particular
<br>
packaging is not around any more?  Why would infinite re-runs of this
<br>
particular
<br>
me package be such a great thing? Just because I am no longer running
<br>
this particular package
<br>
does not mean that *I* am no longer existing at all.  Are we to turn the
<br>
solar system 
<br>
and more into computronium simply to run endless &quot;I Love Me&quot; episodes or
<br>
endless simulations
<br>
of our past packagings and points of view?  That doesn't seem
<br>
particularly meaningful. 
<br>
Although I can see where it might be great fun for a while, now and
<br>
then. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I want that time and the opportunity to witness all of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; changes and much more.  It is not death so much that I seek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to avoid but the end of becoming and being.  I am not done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with that and don't plan to be done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's more like it!  Well said at last.
