I've been following the P2P activity pretty closely.  It will be very
<br>
interesting to see which side wins this ongoing war.
<br>
<p>Two sites which I find useful to keep up to date with what is happening
<br>
are <a href="http://www.peertal.com/">http://www.peertal.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.openp2p.com/p2p/news.csp">http://www.openp2p.com/p2p/news.csp</a>.
<br>
Both specialize in P2P news.

<p>Alex Future Bokov writes to <a href="http://ga.to/children/">http://ga.to/children/</a>:
<br>
<em>&gt; 1. Give one scheme of keeping current intellectual property laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforceable without implementing legal and technical measures that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and therefore eventually will) be abused as censorship and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-privacy measures.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good point, and it is one of the issues raised in the battle
<br>
over the DeCSS software (which decrypts DVD movies).  The DMCA allows
<br>
copyright holders to design protection systems and criminalizes efforts to
<br>
break them.  This is justified on the grounds that it simply implements
<br>
the existing rules about copyright.  However copyright has limitations,
<br>
such as expiring after 100 years or so.  The DMCA has no corresponding
<br>
rule to force holders to give up their rights.  It also allows people
<br>
to protect even uncopyrighted material.  It actually expands the rights
<br>
of publishers a great deal.  Hopefully the courts will be receptive to
<br>
this argument and weaken the DMCA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My question is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this: is an industry that would otherwise collapse entitled to use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government as a crutch indefinitely? Is overall wealth and progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximized by such practices?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Supposing the public is willing to accept an abridgement of privacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and free speech, given the increasing availability and sophistication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cryptographic software, will such an abridgement even be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technically possible?
</em><br>
<p>A good reference for this is the Kelsey and
<br>
Schneier article on the &quot;Street Performer Protocol,&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue4_6/kelsey/index.html">http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue4_6/kelsey/index.html</a>.  These
<br>
expert cryptographers describe technical, legal and practical problems
<br>
with the various cryptographic schemes which have been proposed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; PS: I notice in your essay on why Napster can't relocate to Sealand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you overlooked another option. The protocols used by Napster are known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there is no reason why an anonymous party can't simply release a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverse-engineered, open source version of Napster, allowing hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of independent, non-profit, and possibly anonymously owned servers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spring up all over the world overnight?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this has been happening with the &quot;OpenNap&quot; protocol, opennap.sourceforge.net.
<br>
See www.napigator.com for information on OpenNap servers around the world,
<br>
and software that can make your Napster client access these other servers.
<br>
<p>However, there are reports that the recording industry has begun to put
<br>
legal pressure on operators of OpenNap servers.  It remains to be seen
<br>
whether this is a viable solution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, if I was running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the company, the temptation would be strong to release all my source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code as a parting shot to those who drove me out of business. Finally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is to prevent something completely decentralized like Gnutella,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (gnutella.wego.com) from driving the final nails into the intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property coffin?
</em><br>
<p>I think in general your questions are devoted more to the pragmatic
<br>
issues of enforcing copyright, whereas the author you are replying to
<br>
was arguing the moral question.
<br>
<p>I agree that there are reasonable justifications for copyright,
<br>
but nevertheless I also agree with the points Alex makes here that
<br>
to actually implement copyright in today's world appears to require
<br>
invasive technology.  I strongly believe in privacy, and if this comes
<br>
into conflict with copyright, I would rather retain privacy than submit
<br>
to the kinds of surveillance and control that appear to be necessary to
<br>
enforce intellectual property rules.
<br>
<p>VR pioneer Jared Lanier proposed an &quot;if this goes on&quot; scenario last month
<br>
(<a href="http://www.discover.com/feb_01/gthere.html?article=featnapster.html">http://www.discover.com/feb_01/gthere.html?article=featnapster.html</a>)
<br>
in which even possession of ordinary stereo speakers would be illegal.
<br>
Sound reproduction devices would have to have digital rights management
<br>
(DRM) technology in them which would confirm that you had purchased the
<br>
rights to any music you were trying to listen to.  He shows what extreme
<br>
measures would be necessary to allow content publishers to enforce the
<br>
restrictions they desire.  It's an absurdist, Kafkaesque nightmare.
