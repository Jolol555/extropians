Spike 'dissed my 'dissing using the solar sail as a reflector with:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose you have a solar sail that you wish to return to earth for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another load of something.  You want to bring a tank of liquid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogen.  If you fold the sail and place it between the tank and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sun, much of the solar heat is reflected away, reducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the work needed to keep the hydrogen cold.  The conductivity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the sail is immaterial if it isnt actually touching the tank, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it need not do.  It could be supported by a spindly rod, a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a lady's parasol.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Spike, I will grant you that you can reflect back &quot;much&quot; of the
<br>
visible light (99% perhaps).  But I am moderately sure that
<br>
IR reflectance for most materials is much lower than visible
<br>
reflectance.  (For example silver is the best reflector in V,
<br>
but I think gold becomes better in IR.  But I think even gold
<br>
loses its effectiveness rapidly as you go into the mid-&gt;far IR.
<br>
There isn't any difference between sticking the solar sail
<br>
between the Sun and the H2 tank and mirroring the outside
<br>
of the tank.  The solar sail will absorb IR and re-radiate
<br>
it as a black body thereby exposing the H2 tank to that
<br>
heat radiation.  *If* you can coat the H2 tank with a several
<br>
hundred-to-thousand atom thickness dielectric that *can* reflect
<br>
VIS &amp; IR, then the solar sail is irrelevant.  If you can't
<br>
then the solar sail doesn't help the problem much.  If all
<br>
you are going to reflect back is the visible, you might
<br>
as well simply mirror the tank itself.  The coating
<br>
on the H2 tank is always going to be much thinner than
<br>
the thickness required for structural integrity, so its
<br>
really a point not worth considering (at least from a mass
<br>
standpoint).
