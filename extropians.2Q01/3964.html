I apologize for not being complete in my earlier statement
<br>
<p>I meant to ask, what about electronic SENSOR chips standardized, cheaply 
<br>
mass produced, and mandatory by law, like smoke detectors or Co2 detectors 
<br>
that would detect &quot;sniff&quot; a unique chemical dopiant, that would not be 
<br>
deterious to the fuel apparatus, this would not be a mercap*, but something 
<br>
unique?

<p>I don't know any cheap mass-produced sensors which have an odour
<br>
threshold of:
<br>
<p>Odor Threshold: Ethanethiol=0.2 ppb, isopropyl mercaptan=0.024 ppb TBM=0.008 
<br>
ppb

<br>
<p>This is mindbogglingly low. Even while we're not canines, our rhinoequipment
<br>
is quite impressive.
