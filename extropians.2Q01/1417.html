<p>No way in the next N centuries will chess be reduced to
<br>
equations.  I know what you probably mean, and I agree:
<br>
It was shocking to some chess players that their beloved
<br>
game has been mastered by the very pragmatic algorithms
<br>
used by chess programs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Modern chess software running on modern computing hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plays in a way that is indistinguishable from a really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sharp human player.
</em><br>
<p>But I have seen a number of computer combinations that would
<br>
never in practice be found by an over-the-board grandmaster!
<br>
The tactical insight is really superhuman.  The program
<br>
considers possibilities too counter-intuitive for people
<br>
because it has the resources to.  And some chess combinations
<br>
(we have now learned) begin from really strange, inhuman moves.
<br>
The look-ahead is so pronounced, that even in situations where
<br>
positional considerations appear to dominate, the machine plays
<br>
as if it understood very deep principles (that I do not believe
<br>
have yet been programmed in).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My friends, that's all it is, and that's all we are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wet computers that somehow do what we do.  Both cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give me hope that we will eventually figure out a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to encase ourselves in a more robust and permanent &quot;body&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; spike
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree!  We've never been anything but (biological)
<br>
machines from day one, and it gives me the creeps that I go
<br>
around all day without a backup.
