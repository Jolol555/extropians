<p>So why not do both?  Incentivise the medics by offering any and all

organs below the neck, under the condition that they can be harvested
<br>
only after the head has been suffused and removed by the cryo team,
<br>
who are given first priority.  Then the organ people have incentive
<br>
to get you cooled and beheaded quickly.  spike
