<p>&lt;&lt; It became clear that the Roman Empire was declining when it gave up on 
<br>
&nbsp;maintaining its roads, bridges and aqueducts.  I hope our current problems 
<br>
&nbsp;are not the result of comparable social weakness. &gt;&gt;
<br>
The Roman roads, aqueducts, ports, bridges, were built with the work of 
<br>
slaves. Our failing are not the Roman's failings, no matter how much the 
<br>
promoters of this notion are. It wasn't taxes alone that weakened the Romans, 
<br>
it was dependence of slavery for labor and commerce, with no development of a 
<br>
sustainable working and middle class. It was lead leakage into drinks, it was 
<br>
poverty as a policy, it was the desire for human labor, over the brilliant 
<br>
inventions of Vitruvius and the like. It was the suppression of both 
<br>
democratic and capitalist tendencies. An extremely, poor, means of 
<br>
transferring governing power.  It was climatic change, driving eastern 
<br>
peoples into western Europe. It was not that the poor schmucks lacked for 
<br>
infrastructure.  Rome was closer  to 15th century China where decree's 
<br>
mandated that every son must follow into his father's profession, it was the 
<br>
mandate that no inventor would ever profit from his invention.
