<p>Just trying to be illustrative. Using bits of many different fields is good,

of course. Does anyone actually manage to do this, without becoming a

<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, I've ceased to expect innovation from Comp. Sci. types.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That field stagnates across the border, a real pity.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Much of my justification for this point of view is that we have a big

push
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the biotech area now, which doesn't look likely to abate soon. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emerging field is necessarily computationally intensive; see this fluffy
</em><br>
NYT
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; article, which talks about the fact that biology is using the most
</em><br>
computer
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time at the moment of all the sciences:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And they're only doing sequence yet. Very little structural work so far.
</em><br>
<p>Lots of big fun to come...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Top quote from the article:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;If I were 21 years old, I probably wouldn't go into computing. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computing industry is about to become boring. I'd go into genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engineering.&quot; - Larry Ellison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd go into nanotechnology.
</em><br>
<p>me too. Although it's all converging in the same direction eventually, yes?
<br>
Blue gene (etc etc) must go down as a forerunner, enabling technology for
<br>
what will be nanotech...
<br>
<p>Say it to Larry - he might bet you a million dollars that &quot;genetic
<br>
engineering&quot; is better. If you are lucky.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Major computational resources, the smarts to use them, biotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (cough*nanotech*cough) and a LOT of dollars will combine into something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which I think will beat the cognitive science approach to AI/IA/etc. We
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you talking about robust AI Minsky or Lenat style? That's pure snake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil they're peddling.
</em><br>
<p>Slartibardfast offers to swap Arthur Dent's brain for an artificial one in
<br>
Hitchhikers'; the articificial brain was supposed to manage &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, and
<br>
&quot;can I have a cup of tea?&quot;, if my long term memory serves. Sounds about in
<br>
the ballpark for handmade AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; going to get the aeroplane before the bird. And, it sure as hell is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going to be hand coded, although the systems that generate the systems
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generate it may be, maybe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree very much. However, you'll observe that most of your peers don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yet). So it will take a while still, unless some unknown hotshot whips up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a killer demo, galvanizing the rest of them into frantic action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, I'm not holding my breath.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have the sneaking suspicion that much is happening, and will continue to
<br>
happen, in the corporate world, behind closed (or at least only slightly
<br>
ajar) doors.
