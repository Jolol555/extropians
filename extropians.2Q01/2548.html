Fascinating stuff, isn't it? Anyone interested in maxing out on MC 
<br>
(on all topics), stop by here:

<br>
<p>A few fave quotes:
<br>
<p>Q: What have your immense wealth and success earned you?
<br>
A: The right to be resented wherever I go.
<br>
<p>-
<br>
<p>Q: You've been quoted as saying everyone in Hollywood is stupid. Is 
<br>
that accurate?
<br>
A: No; what I actually said was &quot;Everyone in Hollywood is INCREDIBLY 
<br>
stupid.&quot; [Later retracted, more or less--though I'd say largely 
<br>
correct.]
<br>
<p>-
<br>
<p>A lot of what I've done in the past has been misunderstood--at least 
<br>
from my standpoint. When I was writing Jurassic Park, I was in a 
<br>
tremendous panic. I thought, It's one thing to try to do a persuasive 
<br>
story about a satellite that comes down--we know there are satellites 
<br>
and one could theoretically come down. But in the case of Jurassic 
<br>
Park, I was going to try to convince readers and then viewers that 
<br>
dinosaurs reappear in the contemporary world. I was panicked that 
<br>
people would start to read it and go, &quot;Forget it! No way!&quot; All of my 
<br>
focus was there. Then I write the thing and everybody buys it without 
<br>
discussion. They buy that science brought back dinosaurs. And then 
<br>
they say, &quot;Yeah, but the characters are no good.&quot;
