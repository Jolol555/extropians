<p>You missed my point.  You will remain as one full-time guy until you
<br>
change your actions to allow others to help.  You don't have to retype
<br>
your notes for each and every person; just type up what you have in
<br>
some place everyone can see, point questioners there, and use that
<br>
place as your main working repository.
<br>
<p>That doesn't mean white papers.  That means *running code*, or at least
<br>
the framework of such (at least pseudocode with no &quot;undefined magic
<br>
happens here&quot; bits), which you then won't have to rewrite for various
<br>
architectures (code mongers can port your stuff to their platforms:
<br>
porting is a common operation).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sorry if I managed
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You're in such a rush to complete your project, you don't have time to
<br>
complete your project.  It's a common malady/paradox among modern
<br>
projects, though it's more visible among commercial projects (since
<br>
they ship their buggy, incomplete, rushed project anyway, on a schedule
<br>
close to what their developers originally estimated but with an attempt
<br>
to do it in half the time, and the other half trying to patch up that
<br>
mistake).
<br>
<p>That is to say, I was volunteering to *be* that &quot;full-time person&quot; to
<br>
run Flare, but I couldn't since you failed to get me the info; other
<br>
people look at what you have, see a total lack of specs one could
<br>
develop from, and don't bother even to ask, assuming that those specs
<br>
don't and won't exist.  My situation has changed in light of this and
<br>
other things, and I may no longer be in a position to write Flare - but
<br>
there are others.
<br>
<p>Suggestion: write up and post what you have, then mostly forget about
<br>
it until someone (in a similar situation as I was) starts writing it
<br>
without your oversight.  Get it ready for handoff, so it can take off
<br>
with minimal, maybe zero, further input of your time afterwards.
<br>
<p>Question to the rest of the list: I'm sure someone else can see the
<br>
point I'm trying to make.  Can anyone else state it in a clearer
<br>
fashion, such that Eliezer can see the path out of being a perpetual
<br>
one-man job?  (A certain set of actions will be necessary; funding is
<br>
not the only path, nor even the one most likely to get results if
<br>
funding and a biz plan are not actively pursued.)
