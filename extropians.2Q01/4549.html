<p><em>&gt; Reminds me of good old Ben Franklin, who wrote in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autobiography:  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the
<br>
sentiments of others, and all positive assertion of my own. 
<br>
I even forbade myself the use of every word or expression in
<br>
the language that imported a fixed opinion, such as &quot;certainly&quot;,
<br>
&quot;undoubtedly&quot;, etc.   I adopted instead of them &quot;I conceive&quot;,
<br>
&quot;I apprehend&quot;, or &quot;I imagine&quot; a thing to be so or so; or &quot;so it
<br>
appears to me at present&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied
<br>
myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing
<br>
him immediately some absurdity in his proposition.  In answering
<br>
I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his
<br>
opinion would be right, but in the present case there appeared
<br>
or seemed to me some difference, etc.
<br>
<p>&quot;I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the
<br>
conversations I engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest
<br>
way in which I proposed my opinions procured them a readier
<br>
reception and less contradiction.  I had less mortification when
<br>
I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevailed with
<br>
others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
<br>
happened to be in the right.&quot;  &lt;
<br>
<p><p>Well, I don't deny those advantages, and it's obvious that these
<br>
strategies often smooth troubled waters to everyone's benefit.
<br>
But there is also something too evasive about the lack of candor
<br>
this entails.
<br>
<p>It has to be possible to aim simultaneously for frankness without
<br>
bluntness, diplomacy without deceit, and plain speaking without
<br>
offense.  Probably if one merely successfully avoids insult,
<br>
egomania, condescension, ridicule, and sarcasm, then one may
<br>
speak with complete frankness.  And when this does offend---as
<br>
sometimes it will---well, then that's just too bad.
