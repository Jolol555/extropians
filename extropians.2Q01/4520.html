I've had discussions about this article off-list with Max and
<br>
Damien, but since Brian saw fit to post the article on-list
<br>
I feel it is necessary to respond to correct any incorrect
<br>
memes that may be circulating as a result.
<br>
<p>[Brian -- In the future before you copy an article to a list that
<br>
mentions an Extropian -- you *might* want to check with any mentioned
<br>
extropians to determine *whether* or *not* the comments are accurate!
<br>
At a fundamental level -- are you verifying your sources or are you
<br>
propagating religious &quot;hear-say&quot;?]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Scientists generally agree that human life can be extended, but are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided about how much. Optimists hope a breakthrough in the next 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 30 years will extend human life to 150 years or more, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservatives believe life will be extended slowly, as a side 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect of regenerative drugs. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there is little agreement that the lifespan can be
<br>
extended within the people qualified to discuss this.  The
<br>
recent bet between Steve Austad and S. Jay Olshansky (mentioned
<br>
in The Scientist) points this out (though they are two of the
<br>
optimists who are debating on whether the extension can be to 130
<br>
or 150 years).  Anyone who is well informed in this area knows
<br>
the answers *are NOT* in &quot;regenerative drugs&quot;.  (But since
<br>
investment bankers see the word &quot;drugs&quot; and read it as &quot;$$$&quot;
<br>
this is what gets discussed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Steve Jurvetson, a partner at the venture-capital firm Draper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fisher Jurvetson, is scouting out ways to get into the field. He 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes that within 30 years, people will live 120 to 140 years. 
</em><br>
<p>Steve has seen a copy of my current business plan which speaks to
<br>
some of the advanced biotechnologies related to pro-longevity therapies.
<br>
This quote is before he read the plan and I suspect he would
<br>
view the longevity numbers now as even higher.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ellison has shown a lifelong fascination with science and age. 
</em><br>
<p>Larry has a strong interest in science yes.  He has a strong
<br>
physics background and spent a summer vacation &quot;doing&quot; molecular
<br>
biology research.  I believe that I most probably played a catalytic
<br>
role in his interest in aging research.  During the years of 1982-1987
<br>
when I had the greatest contact with him, he never expressed an interest in
<br>
&quot;aging&quot; per se, so this comment would seem to be &quot;reporting&quot; spin-doctoring.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Later, Robert Miner, co-founder of Oracle, also died of cancer at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 52. Ellison pretended Miner didn't have cancer or wouldn't have it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for long, according to those close to him.
</em><br>
<p>This is completely incorrect.  The information that I have indicates
<br>
that both Larry and Bob were investing in companies that
<br>
were doing cancer drug research that could have saved Bob.
<br>
So they were both doing what they could to try and address Bob's
<br>
situation.  Though I do not remember the exact dates, it was
<br>
probably sometime between late 1996 to mid 1997, I did propose
<br>
to Bob that he should take a serious look at cryonics.  He
<br>
discussed it with me but rejected the idea because he did not
<br>
want his family to live their lives for many years not knowing
<br>
whether he was alive or dead (an interesting response and quite
<br>
valid from my perspective).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One was Aeiveos ... founded by Robert Bradbury ...
</em><br>
<p>Another interesting case of the reporter getting it incorrect.
<br>
Aeiveos Corporation was founded by myself in 1992 and never
<br>
received any funding from Larry.  It was the joint partnership
<br>
between Aeiveos Corporation and Tako Ventures -- known
<br>
as &quot;Aeiveos Sciences Group&quot; that was supported indirectly
<br>
by Larry.  During most of its operational lifetime (~86%)
<br>
I had appointment authority for the majority of the ASG board.
<br>
The termination of the AC/ASG partnership was initiated by myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But soon it became clear that without a basic scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthrough, profits were elusive, observers said.
</em><br>
<p>It was not so much that &quot;profits were elusive&quot;, but that the
<br>
business plan was intentionally designed for an investor
<br>
such as Larry that could fund a long term research effort
<br>
that *was not* designed to produce profits in the normal
<br>
time period investors require.  In late 1997 Tako choose
<br>
not to continue investing in Aeiveos Sciences Group.
<br>
Subsequently the Ellison Medical Foundation was formed
<br>
to fund aging research similar to that which ASG had
<br>
previously been conducting.  The rational for this remains
<br>
a mystery to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ``I find it intriguing,'' said Johnson, the scientist, ``that Larry 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ellison was bankrolling them, but unlike his astuteness in running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer engineering, he ignored people who knew what was going on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the field he was funding.''
</em><br>
<p>Precisely.  People working in the field of aging research
<br>
and interventions have only made serious progress in the
<br>
last 3-4 years out of the last century.  The business plan
<br>
that ASG had was extremely aggressive in its approach and
<br>
the Scientific Advisory Board did include leading researchers in
<br>
the field of aging (e.g. Jan Vijg, George Martin, Steve Austad
<br>
and others).  Tom's comments are presumably motivated by the fact that
<br>
around the time that I decided to terminate the connection between AC
<br>
and ASG, he was seeking access to Larry for funding for his work.
<br>
So I read this as &quot;sour grapes&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ellison put Lederberg on the board, and recruited another big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; player: Richard Sprott, former director of the Biology of Aging 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program at the National Institute of Aging. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sprott said Ellison is ``hands-on'' in funding decisions. But some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say Lederberg and Sprott have reined him in. 
</em><br>
<p>Sprott is an &quot;on-public-record&quot; deathist.  From the limited contact
<br>
I've had with Joshua Lederberg, I would say he as well has mixed
<br>
feelings with regard to lifespan extension.  So it isn't surprising
<br>
that they have &quot;reined Larry in&quot;.
<br>
<p>So the advisors for the EMF would seem to have perspectives
<br>
that are somewhat at odds with Larry's.  While you can
<br>
count on Larry pushing the envelope, he will at the same time
<br>
balance that with more conservative influences so he doesn't
<br>
appear &quot;too&quot; far off the wall.
<br>
<p>As far as how one should view efforts by people &quot;committed&quot; to
<br>
anti-aging research -- the article mentions that Larry is investing
<br>
$45 million per year (only 45% of which is for anti-aging research).
<br>
Please do not think that the following comment discounts that
<br>
investment -- from the public disclosures that I have
<br>
seen those investments seem to be well made.  However, it is
<br>
worth bearing in mind that Larry's funding is around 5% of the
<br>
National Institute of Aging annual budget.  To represent an investment
<br>
comparable to my previous investments (on a net worth basis) he would
<br>
have to invest an *order of magnitude* more than tha NIA in anti-aging
<br>
research for the next decade.  The only individual I know who may
<br>
have exceeded this level of personal commitment is Saul Kent.
<br>
It is also worth noting that a level of funding that high would
<br>
probably *not* accelerate anti-aging research in proportion to
<br>
the amount of money being spent.  There are simply not enough
<br>
researchers who are really educated in the arena of aging and
<br>
age-related pathologies that you could cost-effectively spend
<br>
several billion dollars annually.  That is something that requires
<br>
a commitment to work ourselves up to over 3-5 years.  It is the
<br>
concept that you have to &quot;begin by being there&quot; (i.e. that lifespan
<br>
extension *is* possible) that leads to increases in funding, that
<br>
leads to more young people educating themselves in an area, that
<br>
leads to more scientific progress and interventions.  If I have
<br>
stood on the edge of the cliff and fallen off it so that many
<br>
others will walk up to and explore its edge, then I have provided
<br>
a service to humanity.  May the future make it so.
<br>
