<p>
Max/Michael/James:
<br>
<p>It wasn't clear to me in my original reading of the post
<br>
that AAR was coming out against the quotes in Steve's letter.
<br>
<p>You can find a pointer to the cleaned up letter and some
<br>
further references under:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/LongevityPolitics/index.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/LongevityPolitics/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>Now, one should be very careful when one argues these areas
<br>
(instead of having a knee jerk response that quotes taken
<br>
out of context are designed to generate).
<br>
<p>For example, even I would argue that spending huge amounts of
<br>
money on medical treatments for people in the last year of
<br>
their life is a complete waste and such funds could be much
<br>
better used making micro-loans in third world banks.  Many more
<br>
lives would be saved.
<br>
<p>Callahan has done a lot of research into the misapplication
<br>
of funds in medical care.  His positions are based on
<br>
learning to make rational tradeoffs on the allocation of
<br>
scarce resources.   Chapman is making a reasonable moral
<br>
argument that I would agree has strong merits.
<br>
<p>If one condition were met, I would agree with these two
<br>
indivduals -- &quot;that we knew for a fact that the indefinite
<br>
extension of human life is impossible&quot;!
<br>
<p>If that statement could be proven true, then their positions
<br>
would be entirely defensible.  But because it cannot be
<br>
proven true, then one has a triangle shaped-slippery slope.
<br>
Up until the point that you know you can indefinitely
<br>
extend the lifespan, allocating resources for people
<br>
at the end of their lives is a waste relative to allocating
<br>
resources to people at the beginning of their lives.
<br>
However as soon as it becomes relatively clear that the
<br>
sea-saw is about to flip, it becomes a totally different
<br>
picture.  Resolving the question of what fraction of
<br>
your resources should be devoted to accellerating the
<br>
day when the paradigm flips is a very difficult question.
<br>
<p>Robert
