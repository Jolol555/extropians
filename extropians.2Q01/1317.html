<p>No, no, no. its a bell curve that has to
<br>
be adjusted for redundancy.  For example
<br>
Anders has zillions of references because he
<br>
has lots of pages with high information content
<br>
(as do others, partularly Amara).  Now the
<br>
academics (Max, Robin, Nick, etc.) have to
<br>
have some kind of 'adjustment' factor added
<br>
as would artistic people like Natasha or
<br>
E. Shaun (please people don't rake me over
<br>
the carpet if I neglect to mention you).
<br>
The academics need a &quot;significance&quot; adjustment
<br>
factor (for which Anders role-playing pages
<br>
do not count [in contrast to his Dyson Sphere FAQ]).
<br>
<p>Many of H.K. Hensons mentions should presumably
<br>
be adjusted downwards due to the fact that
<br>
after the 5th page of the &quot;war&quot; he is engaged in
<br>
we just don't care anymore (though I am certain
<br>
that Keith does).  So there has to be some way
<br>
of discounting pages that concentrate at the peak
<br>
of similarity while adjusting the weight of
<br>
pages based on the outlying borders of a distribution
<br>
curve.
<br>
<p>Eugene is someplace on one of the downward slopes
<br>
of the curve.  His posts are less frequent
<br>
(and should therefore be up-weighted) but when
<br>
present, are usually meritorious (also justifying
<br>
upweighting)  [Of course with a substantial discounting
<br>
for the argumentative messages (depending on subjective
<br>
weightings of merit in this respect).]
<br>
<p>It isn't how many or few references you have, its
<br>
how authoratative or rich they are in information
<br>
content.  Unfortunately we are not yet very good at
<br>
evaluating those things yet.
<br>
