CurtAdams (my own favorite neoluddite wrote):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Organisms with complex macrostructural construction abilities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have rather slow doubling times. If you want to look at a house- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; builder, the appropriate model is a tree, with doubling times in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years or decades.
</em><br>
<p>Bamboo actually grows *quite* fast.  I think it can reach 3-4
<br>
meter heights in a month or two.  The question you have to ask
<br>
is *why* are the doubling times that long?  Is it an energy
<br>
limitation?  Is it an essential nutrient limitation?  Is it
<br>
a water limitation?  etc.  One of the things that humans are
<br>
good at is mass-transport.  Figure out what the limiting elements
<br>
are in the growth equation and supply them in sufficient abundance
<br>
to work around the problem.  You could even connect your natural
<br>
gas pipeline to a conversion unit that pumped out ATP in abundance
<br>
for the house-seeds so they can grow in the dark!  Yes, I know it
<br>
makes it more expensive, but presumably after your house is
<br>
finished growing, it can manufacture natural gas and pump
<br>
it back into the pipeline, so you only need a short term loan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, we're a very long way from enigneering trees to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular shapes. And think how long it will take to test it! :-) 
</em><br>
<p>The shape problem isn't solved yet because its historically
<br>
been mostly of scientific interest.  I suspect a lot is
<br>
known about how Drosophila gets its shape for example.
<br>
The Zebrafish genome will lay the groundwork for research in
<br>
vertebrate shape development.  If the variety of dogs I see
<br>
people walking around Greenlake in Seattle are any indication
<br>
there is going to be a *big* interest in applying that
<br>
informormation.  Contrary to Eugene's comments there might
<br>
be an application for 6-legged grayhounds if it turns out
<br>
they can run faster.  And of course the Arabadopsis genome
<br>
begins to lay the foundation for understanding plant
<br>
structure.  You can bet that the seed companies are going
<br>
to *love* growing the corn *without* the stalks.
<br>
I'm fairly confident we will get fairly fine structural
<br>
control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm willing to make $100 bets with people that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manufacturing cost of designer bacteria with 1 million+ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; base genomes will be under $10.00 by 2010. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to define &quot;designer&quot;. I can make a bacteria 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do certain things for far less than that, but only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few particular limited things. If you mean a bacteria 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can build a house, you're on.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt you could fit a house-seed genome in a megabase.  Its probably
<br>
at least the complexity of a bamboo genome which even in compressed
<br>
form is probably between a 100 Mbp and 1 Gbp.   I was however *careful*
<br>
about how I phrased the bet -- I said &quot;manufacturing cost&quot; and not
<br>
&quot;design cost&quot;.  Whether we have the designs will depend a lot on
<br>
whether some hot shot entrepreneur can convince a bunch of VC's
<br>
that there is a market for &quot;houses that grow themselves&quot;.  I suspect
<br>
that is going to be less sellable than &quot;designer organs&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't have anything complex that grows in a fermenter. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that they're simple is essential to fast growth in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fermenter - you can just mix them around. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually the nutrient delivery problem is *why* you mix them around.
<br>
Bacteria locally deplete nutrients far faster than diffusion can
<br>
supply them.  Plants and eukaryotic cells however have transporters
<br>
that could be adapted to importing nutrients on the abundant side
<br>
of the cell and exporting them on the depleted side of the cell.
<br>
<p>Then Eugene (just call me a pessimist) Leitl came along with:
<br>
<em>&gt; We can structurally modify plants, a bit, but nothing like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precision required. For house-growing, deviations of a fraction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an inch would have to be recognized and communicated across the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism and we don't have anything like that in plants. 
</em><br>
<p>Ah Eugene, you have to work *across* technologies as well as in depth!
<br>
You use external site-management lasers driven by the blueprint that
<br>
interact with highly specific photoantenna complexes within the cells
<br>
that in turn are tied to the signal transduction pathways for &quot;divide&quot;
<br>
or &quot;commit apoptosis&quot;.
<br>
<p>That should allow you to control the shape of your new house to
<br>
within 10-20 micron accuracy -- much better than human workers!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do you do if your house seedling gets a bad case of mycoplasma?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you want your construction people to daily look out for nitrogen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and microelements in the soil, and see that the bark doesn't get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infested with wood bugs?
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; Parasites sap vigor, and hence feedstock ROI. They also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tie up a scarce resource (people's attention) thus sapping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere by proxy.
</em><br>
<p>You only have to tinker with 20 transfer RNA's and proteins
<br>
to give your house an entirely different genetic code.  I
<br>
suspect making stop codons out of the most common amino
<br>
acid triplets will put a real dent into Nature trying
<br>
to turn your house into lunch.  Its also going to have to
<br>
get pretty inventive as well if the non-growing surfaces are
<br>
completely coated with abalone shell. 
<br>
<p>Presumably you handle the nitrogen problem in ways similar
<br>
to those used by the nitrogen fixing bacteria.  Probably
<br>
several layers under the surface cells in a relatively
<br>
anaerobic environment with transporters for exporting fixed
<br>
nitrogen to the aerobic cells.  I'm sure you can do the
<br>
arithmetic on the mass of the house and the mass of the
<br>
essential elements needed.  I suspect its probably in the
<br>
vicinity of a pickup truck load or less.  You can probably
<br>
gain a lot by programming in the nutrient export methods
<br>
trees use in the fall.  It would be interesting to see if
<br>
those cells completely reverse the micronutrient flow from
<br>
importing to exporting.  If you can restrict the micronutrient
<br>
needs to the growing surfaces only, I suspect the micronutrient
<br>
mass requirements will be very low.
<br>
<p>I do agree however that the medical applications will probably
<br>
capture the imagination of researchers long before the construction
<br>
industry is revamped.
