I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But watch out. If you evolve into something that on objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; grounds is not-Samantha, then unless you've arranged that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; earlier versions of you get ample run time, you'll be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dead. Please don't let that happen.
</em><br>
<p>and Samantha responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would I want to avoid evolving to where one particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; packaging is not around any more?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, that's all right.  I was cautioning (see above) into evolving
<br>
to the point that nothing exists except something that we'd have to
<br>
view, objectively, as non-Samantha.  For example, if we call X the
<br>
1/4 inch long fetus that used to be you, then X has evolved to the
<br>
point that X isn't around any longer.  X is dead.  Totally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would infinite re-runs of this particular me package be such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a great thing?  Just because I am no longer running this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; package does not mean that *I* am no longer existing at all.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are we to turn the solar system and more into computronium simply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run endless &quot;I Love Me&quot; episodes or endless simulations of our past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; packagings and points of view? That doesn't seem particularly meaningful. 
</em><br>
<p>To each his own, I suggest.  But if each future version of you begins
<br>
to reason the way that I think you are reasoning now, there will come
<br>
a time where Samantha doesn't exist.  Just like what happened to X.
<br>
Inch by inch, step by step, it's gradually replaced by something
<br>
different.

<em>&gt; A big number, like 10^10^10^10 years, is not infinite, and maybe we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do that?  But forever is really long... I'd be surprised if you could show
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, I would be very surprised if you could show that it did!
<br>
<p>Of course, we really don't know.  And to me, it's not really important
<br>
either.  It's just that I object when someone starts talking as you did
<br>
about the necessity of eventual mortality, without having anything
<br>
specific to back it up.  Since we don't know, and you can't succinctly
<br>
argue that after 10^10^10^10 years of successful existence our luck
<br>
necessarily has to change, I still detect a prejudice towards mortality
<br>
in your prose (despite the wonderful lyrics of &quot;Alive&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I expect that I'll be toes up, or something approximating that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually. I'm just not in any rush.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, good.  I'm very concerned about the future of music, and this
<br>
is reassuring.  No joke.
