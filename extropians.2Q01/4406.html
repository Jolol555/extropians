<p>The Next FDA Commissioner Could Determine How Long You Live!
<br>
<p>May 17, 2001
<br>
<p><p>Dear Fellow Life Extensionist:
<br>
<p>The greatest obstacle to your health and longevity is the FDA.  
<br>
<p>Bureaucratic barriers at the FDA stifle the development of novel
<br>
medicines, causing the suffering and death of Americans who desperately
<br>
need these therapies to stay alive.
<br>
<p>While Congress and the Federal Courts have helped curtail FDA
<br>
over-regulation, today's flawed system continues to deny Americans access
<br>
to the best that science has to offer.
<br>
<p>We now have a unique opportunity to change the course of medical history.
<br>
President Bush is considering whom to nominate as the next FDA
<br>
Commissioner. 
<br>
<p>There is one candidate for the Commissioner's job who has a plan to reform
<br>
the FDA in order to speed the delivery of the fruits of medical research
<br>
to every one of us.
<br>
<p>The name of this candidate is Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D. The information that
<br>
follows shows that Dr. Ruwart is uniquely qualified to reform an agency
<br>
that has lost touch with scientific objectivity.
<br>
<p>It is imperative that you notify President Bush that Dr. Ruwart is the
<br>
best person to remedy the severe problems that exist at the FDA. Please
<br>
copy and mail the letter that follows to the President at the address we
<br>
have provided.
<br>
<p>If you want to do more, and we hope that you will, we encourage you to
<br>
write a personalized letter to mail or fax to The White House. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We have also provided a phone number for those who want to call The White
<br>
House to emphasize the importance of appointing Dr. Ruwart as the next FDA
<br>
Commissioner.
<br>
<p>Even if you have not participated in these types of FDA-reform campaigns
<br>
in the past, we urge you to do so on this critical issue.
<br>
<p>Our fear is that lifesaving therapies will continue to remain bogged down
<br>
in FDA red tape if a change within the agency is not made. It has become
<br>
so burdensome to gain FDA approval that innovative therapies in the U.S.
<br>
are being abandoned because of extraordinarily high costs and uncertain
<br>
bureaucratic delays. 
<br>
<p>If Dr. Ruwart were to become the new Commissioner, this barrier against
<br>
medical innovation would be diminished.  More Americans would gain rapid
<br>
access to novel medical treatments that could significantly extend the
<br>
healthy human life span.
<br>
<p>What makes the FDA problem unique is the possibility that each of us will
<br>
die from a disease that could have been effectively treated if the FDA
<br>
didn't stand in the way.
<br>
<p>Inefficient government thrives on citizen apathy, so please take the time
<br>
to mail the enclosed letter to President Bush.  The life you save may be
<br>
your own!
<br>
<p>For longer life,
<br>
<p>William Faloon
<br>
<p>P.S. Those who understand the urgent need for FDA reform and want to do
<br>
more should send The White House a personalized letter and/or make a phone
<br>
call. The information that follows reveals how you can get your message
<br>
through to The White House.
<br>
<p>Dr. Mary J. Ruwart's Letter to President Bush:
<br>
<p>Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D.
<br>
408 County Road 138-C
<br>
Burnet, TX 78611
<br>

<br>
<p>President G.W. Bush
<br>
Presidential Personnel Office
<br>
The White House
<br>
Washington, DC 20500
<br>
<p>Dear President Bush,
<br>
<p>I am enclosing my Presidential Personnel Application Form and resume in
<br>
order that you might consider my appointment as FDA Commissioner.  Because
<br>
you have already invited a number of market-minded individuals to your
<br>
team, I hope that you will look favorably on my pro-market orientation. 
<br>
<p>My nomination for FDA Commissioner is likely to enjoy widespread support,
<br>
especially from the groups listed below.
<br>
<p>1.  Pharmaceutical industry.   For almost twenty years, I was a research
<br>
scientist at a major pharmaceutical company and understand the impact of
<br>
regulatory delays. Former FDA Commissioner, Alexander Schmidt, once
<br>
remarked, &quot;The failure to approve an important new drug can be as
<br>
detrimental to the public health as the approval of a potentially bad
<br>
drug.&quot; As your appointee, I would pursue a more cooperative approach with
<br>
pharmaceutical firms in order to speed the delivery of new, life-saving
<br>
medications to the American public. 
<br>
<p>2.  Physicians.  Doctors often prescribe approved medications for
<br>
off-label uses in order to give their patients the best health care
<br>
options.  However, the FDA discourages drug companies from sharing
<br>
information that would educate physicians about these choices for their
<br>
patients.  As your appointee, I would make this valuable knowledge on
<br>
off-label use available to our dedicated health care practitioners.
<br>
<p>3.  Alternative practitioners. Health care professionals who utilize
<br>
non-traditional methods of treatment are often subjected to prejudicial
<br>
treatment by the FDA, even in the absence of patient complaints.  As your
<br>
appointee, I would intervene only when patients were at risk, thereby
<br>
broadening our health care choices. 
<br>
<p>4.  American public.  Whenever Congress considered giving the FDA more
<br>
control over nutritional supplements, voters inundated their
<br>
representatives with protests.  The American public clearly wants the
<br>
freedom to choose what vitamins and minerals to take.  As your appointee,
<br>
I would honor the choice of my fellow Americans.  
<br>
<p>5.  Dedicated FDA employees.  FDA examiners are in a no-win situation.  If
<br>
they delay approving a drug with life-saving potential, many Americans,
<br>
especially those with terminal diseases, die needlessly.  If the FDA
<br>
approves a drug and unpredictable side effects occur, the FDA is blamed.
<br>
As your appointee, I will alleviate this situation, by allowing terminally
<br>
ill patients to &quot;opt-out&quot; of the approval process.  They will then have
<br>
access to potentially life-saving medications which are not yet through
<br>
FDA review.   
<br>
<p>In 1999, a Federal Appellate Court ruled 11-0 that the FDA must abide by
<br>
the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and permit truthful health
<br>
claims for antioxidants, fiber, folic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids
<br>
(Pearson vs. Shalala). The FDA ignored this decision and in February of
<br>
this year was censured by the court for its failure to comply.  As your
<br>
appointee, I would make sure that the FDA abides by our Constitution, the
<br>
law of the land.   
<br>
<p>As your appointee, my goal will be to facilitate the conversion of the FDA
<br>
from a bureaucratic regulatory regime into a market-oriented support
<br>
system that maximizes our access to life-savings medications.  Of course,
<br>
only a team effort will achieve this dramatic shift.  Win-win strategies,
<br>
such as the ones described above, can help create alignment among groups
<br>
who may sometimes be at odds with each other.  I believe that I have the
<br>
experience and the skills to create such an environment.
<br>
<p>I hope that you will seriously consider moving the FDA in a direction that
<br>
will stimulate innovative drug development.  After all, before we are
<br>
politicians or special interest groups, we are human beings.  Whether we
<br>
enjoy a long life or a short one will largely depend on the availability
<br>
of  life-saving medications.  I would be honored, as your appointee, to
<br>
help the American people-and yourself-achieve the longest, most productive
<br>
life possible.  
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D.
<br>
<p><p><p>Letter to send to the President:
<br>
<p><p>Date:
<br>
<p><p>President George W. Bush
<br>
The White House
<br>
Washington DC 20500
<br>
<p>Dear President Bush:
<br>
<p>I request that you appoint Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D., as the next Commissioner
<br>
of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The reason for the urgency of
<br>
this appointment is that serious institutional problems exist within the
<br>
FDA that cause Americans to suffer and die needlessly. Dr. Ruwart has
<br>
identified what's wrong with the FDA and has proposed practical solutions.
<br>
I am concerned that anyone else you appoint will continue a &quot;business as
<br>
usual&quot; approach that will not result in the kind of reform that is needed
<br>
to prevent disease, injury and death by over-regulation.  In her
<br>
application to you, Dr. Ruwart stated, &quot;My goal will be to facilitate the
<br>
conversion of the FDA from a bureaucratic regulatory regime into a
<br>
market-oriented support system that maximizes our access to life-saving
<br>
medications.&quot; The public is becoming increasingly aware that the FDA is
<br>
largely responsible for the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S.
<br>
When Americans are diagnosed with serious diseases, many are now seeking
<br>
therapies that have not yet been approved by the FDA.  I find it
<br>
deplorable that the agency that is supposed to &quot;protect the health of the
<br>
American public&quot; has become a major impediment to their access of new
<br>
life-saving therapies.  
<br>
<p>The most important issue to me is my health and the cost of prescription
<br>
drugs.  I therefore urge you to make a historic and humane decision by
<br>
appointing Dr. Ruwart as the next Commissioner of the Food and Drug
<br>
Administration. 
<br>
<p>Please let me know your position on this issue.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>

<p><p><p>LET YOUR VOICE  BE HEARD AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
<br>
It's Easier Than You Think!
<br>
<p>We live in a democratic society, yet few Americans take the time to let
<br>
their elected officials know what is really important.
<br>
<p>In the case of the FDA, severe problems have been repeatedly identified,
<br>
but a politically palatable solution has never been conveyed to the
<br>
President of the United States. Since the President will be appointing a
<br>
new FDA commissioner soon, it's time to speak out.  If we fail to point
<br>
out an obvious way of reforming the FDA, it's hard to complain later about
<br>
the agency's continuing inadequacies.
<br>
<p>For the first time in history, a qualified individual has emerged with a
<br>
specific plan to turn the FDA into an organization that will facilitate,
<br>
rather than impede, the development of new therapies to eradicate disease. 
<br>
<p>It is now up to those of us who understand the FDA problem to convey the
<br>
solution to the President. Our message to President Bush is simple. Dr.
<br>
Mary J. Ruwart is the best qualified individual to lead the FDA out of the
<br>
medical dark ages. 
<br>
<p>History has shown us that FDA Commissioners are primarily concerned with
<br>
maintaining the status quo, rather than resolving serious problems within
<br>
the agency. This lack of vision is why Americans continue to suffer and
<br>
die in the FDA's &quot;waiting room&quot;.
<br>
<p>Dr. Ruwart has proposed meaningful reforms within the FDA.  For those
<br>
depending on scientific breakthroughs to stay alive, it is critical for
<br>
the next Commissioner to have the vision to tear down the FDA's barriers
<br>
against medical innovation. Dr. Ruwart has emerged as the most viable
<br>
candidate to implement these life-saving changes.
<br>
<p>The White House is set up to receive suggestions and comments from the
<br>
public. The following are several ways to let your voice be heard:
<br>
<p>Mail your letters to:
<br>
<p>President George W. Bush
<br>
The White House
<br>
Washington, DC 20500
<br>
<p>Fax your letters to The White House Comments Line Fax: 1-202-456-2461
<br>
<p>To discuss these issues with The White House staff, call 1-202-456-1111

it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it&quot;
