</em><br>
<p>I find several problems here.  First off, inflation leads to lower
<br>
efficiency, so it's bad period.  It distorts prices.  It makes for quality
<br>
declines.  Economic measures of inflation tend to underestimate the damage.
<br>
What you have to do to truly measure it would have to be to compare the
<br>
economy sans inflation to it with inflation -- not to the economy in
<br>
deflation.
<br>
<p>Next, I don't think the Fed can stop it per se.  Central banks always
<br>
mismanage money because they do not have the dispersed information available
<br>
to a free market banking system.  Also, they do not have the incentives to
<br>
get it right.  Finally, they do have the incentive to pander to special
<br>
interests, be they politicians, the bureaucracy, the banking industry,
<br>
debtors, or what have you.
<br>
<p>Thirdly, deflation almost never happens and there's good reason for this.
<br>
Deflation leads to unemployment, a very quick sign that something's wrong.
<br>
Deflation still has subtle and complex effects -- see Horwitz's
<br>
_Microfoundations and Macroeconomics: An Austrian Perspective_ on this --
<br>
but it's much easier to see what's wrong.  To be sure, there was a major
<br>
deflationary period in US history during the Great Depression, but it's the
<br>
only one and has never been repeated.  Even worldwide, the big problem is
<br>
inflation -- not deflation.
<br>
<p>This is not to say I'm championing deflation or saying it will never ever
<br>
happen.  I just think it less likely given the incentives to inflate under
<br>
the current [central] banking systems.  Under a free market banking system,
<br>
there would be a disincentive for individual banks to deflate, which would
<br>
simply lead to low profits --a quick and easy to read signal that something
<br>
is wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Japan has flirted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that particular pickle several times recently; certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short-term rates of 0.2% are going to cause their own kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costly distortions. Inflation may be acceptable insurance against that.
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  What is needed is not to inflate or deflate, but to avoid both.
<br>
It's sort of like you're advocating the cure for anorexia is obesity.:)
<br>
<p>Anyhow, a free market banking system would, IMHO, be able to handle a lot of
<br>
these problems -- or, at least, do much better than central banking has
<br>
done.  The timing issue would also be on its side, since it could adjust
<br>
quickly and easily to changes, as opposed to holding meetings and examining
<br>
monthly or quarterly targets.  (The quick measure would be the loss or gain
<br>
of outside money in individual banks.  Each bank would be able to assess
<br>
this immediately -- not after the market tanks or its clients are lined up
<br>
outside to pull their deposits.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, but is it significant?  It's not like the gov't isn't extremely
</em><br>
costly
<br>
<em>&gt; anyway.  And what's the value of &quot;deflation insurance&quot;
</em><br>
<p>As I mention above, both inflation and deflation have subtle and complex
<br>
effects.  These effects are very important because if either flowed evenly
<br>
through the economy, regardless of the cost of government, then they would
<br>
nicely and neatly predictable.  There'd still be some costs -- &quot;shoe
<br>
leather&quot; and &quot;menu&quot; costs -- but the distortions on relative prices would be
<br>
nonexistent.  Every price would just rise or fall -- assuming not rigidities
<br>
(wages are usually downward right; people don't like to take pay cuts, even
<br>
when all costs are dropping:) -- at the same rate.
<br>
<p>However, the problem with inflation and deflation is that this does not
<br>
happen.  In fact, this is the essence of the problem with them -- and why
<br>
they are such a pernicious problem.  To stick with inflation, if the US Fed
<br>
lowers interest rates below the natural rate, then the first to benefit from
<br>
this are often the largest banks and the largest borrowers.  They
<br>
immediately are able to take advantage of the inflation.  They bid up prices
<br>
for the goods and services they purchase -- supply and demand in action --
<br>
and then those they buy from also bid up prices on goods and services they
<br>
purchase and so on.  Eventually, the rise in prices is seen as inflationary,
<br>
but by then the prices have already changed, wealth has already changed
<br>
hands and a different order -- and a less efficient one, since it's not back
<br>
by the real demands of market actors, but by inflationary demands rippling
<br>
through the system -- exists than before or than would have existed had the
<br>
inflation not come about.
<br>
<p>To put it another way, the first group to benefit from inflation benefits
<br>
the most.  Economic &quot;energy&quot; is directed toward them when it would not have
<br>
been.  In effect, it's almost a form of wealth redistribution.  It also
<br>
leads to lower productivity since these are not real demands effecting, but
<br>
merely monetary ones.  People not in that first group are valuing their
<br>
money too highly and they don't know until after prices go up.  This extends
<br>
to all subsequent groups and individuals.
<br>
<p>This is why inflationary periods can destroy whole economies as happened
<br>
right after World War One in Weimar Germany and in many countries during the
<br>
Great Depression.  These distortions are not uncovered and undone by merely
<br>
deflating and depending on how bad they are and what the monetary
<br>
authorities do (and what government policies are enacted to prevent the
<br>
necessary adjustments) they can go on for a long time.  Even afterward, the
<br>
waste is not recoverable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I don't know enough about the Japanese example, though I think there
</em><br>
several
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;problems with government intervention there, including a long period of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;inflation, price rigidities (set by law), and massive subsidies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, yes, yes.  Low inflation for ages.
</em><br>
<p>The figures I've seen have actually shown a high rate of inflation coupled
<br>
with a high savings rate, given that savings were not taxed until the late
<br>
1980s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lots of detrimental gov't intervention;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; besides what you mention, land use distortion, corruption, stock price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propping, and vast waste.   It's scary that in just a decade Japan went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from being the most solvent gov't in the West to one where default
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes under consideration.  They borrowed and spent *trillions* to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulate the economy, with minimal benefit.  Exhibit A against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keynesianism.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed on that last statement, though all of economic history seems a
<br>
collection of exhibits against Keynes, Keynesianism, and the New
<br>
Keynesians.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
