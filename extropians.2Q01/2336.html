<em>&gt; &gt;I agree with Alan - it is a great essay.

I'm afraid that I've got to side with Richard here.  This is nothing we've 
<br>
not heard before, a case that builds itself around the comforting notion of 
<br>
the alleged immutability of the &quot;human condition&quot;.  That people will always 
<br>
be people, unchanging in their core nature.  It's an appeal to emotion on 
<br>
many levels I think, referring both to Science and Religion in a general 
<br>
catch-all.  However, *everything* IS up for grabs, long term.
<br>
<p>As has been said before, some people think the future will be pretty much 
<br>
the same as it is now &quot;except with more chrome&quot;.  This man may just be in 
<br>
for a shock in the next few decades.  The only reason people are still 
<br>
&quot;people&quot; is that they can't change themselves radically...
<br>
<p>Yet.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
