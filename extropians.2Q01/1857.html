A lot of people are saying: &quot;Who cares?  This is just Godel's
<br>
Incompleteness Theorem again.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, yes and no.  Godel showed that there were some unprovable
<br>
truths.  Chaitin is showing that there are some incalculable
<br>
equations.  But these equations aren't &quot;incalculable&quot; in the sense of
<br>
having no answers.  These equations are &quot;incalculable&quot; in the sense
<br>
that their answers are fully random.
<br>
<p>I guess this result is trivial, since a proof is just a certain
<br>
kind of calculation, so once you've shown that there are some
<br>
unprovables, you've shown that there are some incalculables.
<br>
<p>Of course, it's also been shown that there are *important* sentences
<br>
which are unprovable in a given axiomatic system, especially the
<br>
sentence that says: &quot;This axiomatic system is consistent.&quot;  We worry
<br>
that some claims which we take to be facts might also be unprovable.
<br>
(As a side note, Chaitin has nothing new to tell us about the
<br>
possibility that the Goldbach Conjecture or the Reimann Hypothesis are
<br>
unprovable.)
<br>
<p>It's not obvious that Chaitin has demonstrated any important
<br>
incalculable problems that Turing didn't already let us know about.
<br>
The Halting problem is important and relevant.  The question of
<br>
whether a computer that runs for an infinite period will generate a
<br>
finite output, on the other hand, doesn't seem as relevant to our
<br>
lives.
<br>
<p>If I were to guess where a theory like this might *really* turn out to
<br>
be useful, it's in answering the eternal riddle: P == NP?  If Chaitin
<br>
could prove that some NP problem had inscrutable structure, like his
<br>
Omega problem, then it seems to me that this would be sufficient to
<br>
show that NP &gt; P... how could you possibly solve a problem like that
<br>
in polynomial time?  Of course, the trick then is to actually find an
<br>
NP problem that's like that.
<br>
<p>If you do this, I *demand* credit in a footnote.  :)
