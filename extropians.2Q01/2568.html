<br>
To draw lessons about the legal ramifications of ULE, it is useful
<br>
to examine the UK, with its three million CCTV cameras in public
<br>
areas.
<br>
<p>Recently, an alternative comedian (of the kind who get TV shows --
<br>
we're not talking amateurs here, I just wish I could remember his name)
<br>
decided to play a little game. He got a group of people to act out a
<br>
little drama in public, in full view of some cameras. He then identified
<br>
the owners of the cameras -- and whacked them with Data Disclosure Orders
<br>
under the terms of the amended Data Protection Act (1998) in the name
<br>
of the individuals on camera.
<br>
<p>The Data Protection Act (DPR) is a fascinating bit of law. Originally
<br>
passed in 1992 (IIRC) it was designed to regulate commercial databases.
<br>
If you want to keep a personal address book or a club membership list 
<br>
you're exempt, but any other database holding details of people is
<br>
subject to the Act. You have to fill out a form and send it to the Data
<br>
Protection Registrar -- the form lists the type of information you hold
<br>
and the purposes for which it is retained. Thereafter, any member of the
<br>
public can serve a Data Disclosure Order on you and, in return for a fee
<br>
to cover the cost of data retrieval, you are legally obliged to show them
<br>
what information (if any) you have on them. (Note: the maximum level of
<br>
the fee is capped by law to stop companies saying &quot;okay, that'll be a 
<br>
thousand quid then&quot; to deter the public from examining their records.)
<br>
<p>The amendments to the act passed in 1998 (or thereabouts) removed
<br>
exemptions for paper-only records, added exemptions for things like
<br>
usenet and personal email boxes, and included multimedia stuff. NB: it's
<br>
a moderately serious crime (as in -- you can go to prison) to refuse to
<br>
register a database or to refuse to let people see data you hold on them,
<br>
or to refuse to amend their details if they're incorrect, or to sell the
<br>
data to other companies without obtaining prior permission. The whole
<br>
thrust of the law (and the Data Protection Registrar's office) is to
<br>
protect privacy and to allow consumers to correct rumours or outright
<br>
falsehoods about them stored in, for example, credit agency databases.
<br>
<p>The effect of a disclosure notice on the operator of a CCTV network --
<br>
and they're mostly run by private companies subcontracted by local police
<br>
forces -- is apparently most entertaining. Especially seeing as the notice
<br>
refers to named individuals and there's no obvious way of matching up names
<br>
to faces fleetingly glimpsed on camera.
<br>
<p>Even more interesting are the implications of the Bill of Rights (you
<br>
didn't know the UK had one, did you?) which has an explicit right
<br>
to privacy. Put the two together in a lawsuit and you could conceivably
<br>
nail a CCTV operator -- if they don't answer a DDO when you *know* you
<br>
were on camera, you can nail them for violating the DPA, while if they
<br>
*do* respond to it, you can probably nail them under the Human Rights
<br>
Act.
<br>
<p>To say the law's messy at present is an understatement. I have some hopes
<br>
that the right to privacy will survive the cameras; moreover, the DPA --
<br>
which is indispensible, for other reasons -- gives people a powerful tool
<br>
to bash camera operators with. The real point is that the interaction
<br>
between technology and the law is still in a state of flux, and I suspect
<br>
the eventual equilibrium condition (which *will* entail ULE) exhibits
<br>
sensitive dependency on prior conditions. 
<br>
<p>Better get your constitutional amendment for a right to privacy in place
<br>
now, rather than later ...
<br>
