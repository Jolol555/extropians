From: Damien Broderick &lt;<a href="mailto:d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20Godhood%20(was:%20Re:%20How%20To%20Live%20In%20A%20Simulation)&In-Reply-To=&lt;043801c0b937$27569760$9f5be218@hala1.on.home.com&gt;">d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;To the rationalist, the fideist looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;irrational placing so much evidence on interpersonal trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You need to have a person at the other end to do interpersonal trust.
</em><br>
Agreed. I am imaging the God III standing in mum's stead from the original
<br>
analogy.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;To the fideist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the rationalist looks inconsistent because asserting the supremacy of
</em><br>
human
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reason can itself only be a matter of trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A matter of trust in exactly the same consistencies of the world that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underwrite almost all of the fideist's own verities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Certainly it is hard to imagine how the fideist would avoid employing a
<br>
human logical scheme in the workaday world. Kirkegaard makes a case for how
<br>
this might not always be so, e.g., in his reflections on how Abraham trusts
<br>
God to such an extent he is willing to do what seems so contrary to reason,
<br>
viz., sacrificing his own son.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A matter of trust employing the same limits to credulity that the fideist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sets in all matters aside from this extraordinary and improbable claim for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reality of an invisible person who never responds in a publicly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testable fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There is always a slippery slope lurking isn't there? Unlike this case, the
<br>
verificationist-fidiest is imagining that you have evidence that X is an
<br>
incredibly powerful being. X rearranges the stars in the night sky with the
<br>
swope of one hand to form the shape of the young Elvis. X creates an eden on
<br>
earth--football, meat pies, kangroos and holden cars for everyone. Now X
<br>
says to you in English (or Australian I guess in your case) that our brains
<br>
are to small to grasp the true logic of the universe. Can you imagine
<br>
trusting X when he says this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Could we build a God III that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we could not understand but who we could trust?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could not *build* a God III--can't make head or tail of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blueprints, Joe--but we might be able to kickstart something headed in
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt; a direction.
</em><br>
Of course, unless it is entirely a fortious matter. But I am giving fifty
<br>
year extensions on the homework assignment--more if you have a note from
<br>
your doctor.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If it emerged out the far end of the pipeline, could we trust
<br>
<em>&gt; it? Well, we'd need to see what it did; by its fruits we shall know it. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was horrid to us, we'd be silly to trust it. `This hurts me more than
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; hurts you' is the dictum of someone without much imagination or patience.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Absolutely. Mark and not-Mark.
