</em><br>
<p><p>This misses the point entirely.  Who cares if an AI on a Beowulf cluster can
<br>
adapt itself to the Internet if being implemented on the Internet would
<br>
actually lead to a net *loss* of capability?  Distributed systems don't
<br>
scale infinitely or even asymptotically with the number of nodes; they
<br>
eventually peak and then start to decrease in performance.  Slow networks
<br>
and complex problems just make the distributed system peak earlier, and AI
<br>
on the Internet would peak very early indeed.
<br>
<p>In fact, one could argue that a seed AI is not likely spread rapidly over
<br>
the Internet because a seed AI would know enough about distributed systems
<br>
to be able to calculate if there was any net gain in doing so.  But it
<br>
doesn't take a seed AI to actually do those calculations.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I do not agree that network latencies - or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firewalls, for that matter - would present a significant obstacle to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mature, computer-native general intelligence.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is somewhat naïve.  I am not talking about problems that are merely
<br>
difficult or beyond current human ability, I am talking about concepts that
<br>
you can sit down with a pencil and paper, using well-understood math, and
<br>
prove the impossibility/stupidity of their implementation.  I have not seen
<br>
anything offered that explains how so many limits fundamental to the
<br>
mathematics of the problem can be blithely ignored by a sufficiently
<br>
intelligent AI.  Would you please explain how an AI would do this without
<br>
invoking magic?
<br>
<p>Firewalls are largely irrelevant; though some would very arguably (and
<br>
probably verifiably) be impossible to penetrate even with AI, there are
<br>
enough relatively unprotected resources to simply ignore the very well
<br>
protected ones.
