<p><em>&gt; In another article I read today, &quot;Genetically Altered Foods are the Key to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feeding Increasingly Hungry World&quot; (August 27, 2000, Op-ed By Richard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berman)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.guestchoice.com/oped19.htm">http://www.guestchoice.com/oped19.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>I should begin by saying that I'm all in favor of genetically altering food
<br>
crops. I dislike some of the specific alterations that are presently being
<br>
marketed, for example varieties that are being produced that will *only*
<br>
grow well with the use of large quantities of fertilizers and herbicides.
<br>
<p>I'm also aware that there are plenty of people making big bucks selling
<br>
&quot;organic&quot; food. It's also true, as far as I know, that there has been no
<br>
indication that any of the GE food crops are unhealthy (with exception of
<br>
the potato study that Berman refers to in his article. In that study, the
<br>
brains of rats fed on GE potatoes failed to develop normally.).
<br>
<p>But I find it disturbing when people use scare tactics such as stating, as
<br>
Berman does, that GE crops are the only way to prevent massive famine. This
<br>
makes me wonder if Berman doesn't have some hidden agenda. I don't know
<br>
where he got the following information; I do know that it's meaningless as
<br>
presented. He says:
<br>
----------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;Paradoxically, too, this natural food is hard on nature: On the same
<br>
acreage, organic farms produce up to 40 percent less food than conventional
<br>
farms, meaning they plow up that much more land. Widespread organic
<br>
agriculture would also require nitrogen-rich green manure, entailing the
<br>
conversion of more millions of wilderness acres to pasturage.
<br>
----------------------------
<br>
<p>This is one of the most absurd paragraphs I've seen lately. I'd like to know
<br>
which farms? Where? What crops? Over what periods of time?
<br>
