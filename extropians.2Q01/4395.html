<p>You can assume the reaction and diffusion rate to be effectively zero 
<br>
for all time scales but geological (where chiefest damage mechanism 
<br>
will be ionising radiation). The vitrified (glass) phase should not 
<br>
come within the regime when the kinetics of annealing/devitrification 
<br>
will become noticeable. The real issue is not cracking -- cracking is 
<br>
much, much preferable to devitrification, the limit is cryofluid 
<br>
pricing. Current cheapness of LN is largely artefacted of it being a 
<br>
side product of liquid air fractionation (to obtain oxygen for steel 
<br>
production). Most developed countries no longer use that process (they use vacuum 
<br>
electrosteel processes and since recently hydrogen reduction and sintering,
<br>
or enrich oxygen by air by means of molecular sieves if they have to), if 
<br>
they haven't completely outsourced steel production to cheap, environmentally
<br>
unregulated places. So LN prices will go up, requiring a switchover to some other 
<br>
cryogenics method. Both the heat lossage through walls and value of 
<br>
Joule-Thompson coefficient would indicate that you'd want to stick around 
<br>
-150 deg C tops, which is still perfectly fine for vitrified tissue. Of 
<br>
course, you lose the advantage of phase change enthalpy, so you're in 
<br>
deep shit once the power goes out. Not only have you to use expensive 
<br>
cryogenics aggregates, and massive air conditioning to keep these happy,
<br>
you also have to install failsafe power generators, and rapid contingency 
<br>
plans, as your safety window is only a few hours (instead of a couple of
<br>
weeks) wide. Suddenly, things are becoming expensive, complex, and brittle. 
<br>
This is certainly going to have an impact on prices, reliability, or both.
