<p>Please do get into the sociology of people turning themselves into robots...
<br>
I'm intrigued to understand your point of view.
<br>
<p>I've wanted to become one myself, ever since I saw the cybermen when I was
<br>
about 5, on Doctor Who (and Davros, my hero). Nowadays, experiencing early
<br>
degradations in my physical state, I'm more resolved to it than ever. I'm a
<br>
bit kooky about it... I don't care how weird, and &quot;unnatural&quot; it looks; in
<br>
fact, a bit of freakiness is a bonus to my mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I myself like being human.  What would you be without your humanity?
</em><br>
Something more? Maybe,
<br>
<em>&gt; but then again maybe you'll end up a lonely lost set of data in a make
</em><br>
believe world that some
<br>
<em>&gt; AI programmed.  What is the point in that?
</em><br>
<p>How do you know you are not such already? :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously, I love being human too. Being human is excellent. My point of
<br>
view is that the truly natural progression for humans is to advance our
<br>
tools, and inevitably to merge with them. We are the ultimate creators and
<br>
manipulators, and there is nothing wrong with us turning those natural
<br>
predilections inward. It is an entirely human impulse, and its exercise is
<br>
as natural a course of action as any I could imagine.
<br>
<p>The urge to explore, discover, to know? The urge to create? The urge to
<br>
reshape the universe as we see fit? I can't see that in changing myself
<br>
through advanced technology, that I would lose any of those fundamental
<br>
drives, unless I so choose. Where, then, has my humanity gone?
<br>
<p>Think of it from another angle... Take an altered human, vastly altered, who
<br>
is over 100 years old, for example. Perhaps it's the cliched humanoid robot.
<br>
Perhaps it's the human-in-the-sim. Perhaps it's an uploaded mind,
<br>
distributed over a swarm of nanomachines, speeding away from the solar
<br>
system and across the void.You may talk about loss of humanity all you like,
<br>
but what is the &quot;natural&quot; alternative? Death. A dead body has no humanity
<br>
that I can point to; it is the opposite of human. As we are the very
<br>
definition of animate, so is our corpse the negation. Thus, an altered
<br>
human, a transhuman if you will, in retaining any humanity whatsoever, is
<br>
vastly preferable, even by your own metrics.
<br>
<p>I think unaltered humanity has been done to death, if you'll pardon the pun.
<br>
I'm up for something else. It could end up being a stupid idea, to be sure.
<br>
It could all go horribly wrong! But I'm a bit irrational... I'm only human,
<br>
after all.
