Search engines can be more active entities than is commonly thought. First, 
<br>
the crawler part could presumably be extended so that the engine searches for 
<br>
information it somehow discovers is lacking (many requests for certain terms 
<br>
that give low relevance ratios). Especially with the semantic web things turn 
<br>
interesting here. Second, the internal representations of search terms, URLs 
<br>
and their interrelations could very well be seen as a knowledge base of 
<br>
sorts, which could be used to control actions of agents. Beside the usual 
<br>
request for information about something, the system could have alerting 
<br>
services for new interesting information or certain changes in the knowledge 
<br>
base.

<p>I would definitely join it. Do we get to have odd titles too, like &quot;Grand 
<br>
Googler&quot;, &quot;Cached Knight&quot; and &quot;Master of Relevance&quot;? :-)
