<em>&gt; &gt;   WASHINGTON -- A California jury has convicted Keith Henson, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   prominent critic of Scientology, of terrorizing the group through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   Usenet posts and by picketing one of its offices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; !!!! Terrible  !!!!!
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Is there anything we can do?
</em><br>
<p>I see 2 terrible things about this case: first, the fate of Keith Henson;
<br>
second, the First Amendment rights of all Californians.
<br>
<p>I don't know whether California's hate crimes statute has ever been reviewed
<br>
by the US Supreme Court. I'm not an expert in Constitutional Law and don't
<br>
keep up more than casually with US Supreme Court rulings. Maybe someone else
<br>
on the list knows whether or not the constitutionality of California's law
<br>
has been tested. I suspect it would be held unconstitutional. As far as I
<br>
know, in the review of other states' hate crimes laws, the US Sup. Ct. has
<br>
held that it's okay to consider &quot;hate&quot; motives at the sentencing phase of
<br>
trial, but it's not okay to use such motives to convert otherwise lawful
<br>
behavior into criminal activity.
<br>
<p>What could we do? If Keith isn't already represented by a team of top-notch
<br>
lawyers, we could collect enough money to hire people with the expertise
<br>
necessary to sccussfully appeal his case. The news article mentioned that
<br>
the Scientologists had their lawyers on hand to assist the DA. We could also
<br>
write amicus curiae briefs supporting Keith's position.
<br>
<p>We could also publish articles on the Internet and elsewhere using Keith's
<br>
and similar cases as examples of the dangers of hate crimes laws. The most
<br>
common examples used to support hate crimes legislation are the persecutions
<br>
of Christians in the Roman Empire, the persecution of blacks in the southern
<br>
US, and the persecution of Jews in Europe. In all of these cases, the
<br>
persecution was lawful and even encouraged by the state; in many cases state
<br>
officials took part in the persecution. This is qualitatively different from
<br>
the case where an isolated individual assaults or murders, motivated by the
<br>
victim's race or religion. As long as there are laws against assault and
<br>
murder which are applied evenly regardless of the race or religion of either
<br>
the perpetrator or the victim, there's no need for hate crimes laws. In
<br>
fact, there's abundant evidence that the laws aren't applied evenly in
<br>
California and that certain racial and ethnic groups are more likely than
<br>
others to be arrested and, once arrested, to be convicted of criminal
<br>
behavior. This is where the victims of generalized racial hate suffer the
<br>
greatest harm.
<br>
<p>Another thing we could do--wouldn't help Keith but might help to prevent
<br>
this sort of thing in the future--is publish articles and speak out about
<br>
the unfairness of tax exemption and other special treatment for churches.
<br>
Such special treatment discriminates against non-religious individuals who
<br>
are not members of churches. As far as I can tell, the Scientologists run
<br>
what's basically a &quot;self improvement&quot; business (not addressing here whether
<br>
or not their students are actually &quot;improved&quot;), and there's no logical
<br>
reason they should be given more favorable treament under the law than any
<br>
other business (Same could be said for other churches. The Scientologists
<br>
are certainly not the worst of the world's religions and are not unique in
<br>
preying on their members' insecurities and vulnerabilities.). I think it's a
<br>
mistake to single Scientologists out as somehow worse than other religions,
<br>
or to concentrate on proving that they're not really a church. The
<br>
Scientologists' beliefs (parasitic aliens hitching rides on our bodies, or
<br>
whatever it is they believe) are no sillier than the beliefs of many other
<br>
religions.
