From: Brian D Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:talon57@well.com?Subject=Re:%20Antartica%20instead%20of%20Mars%20(was:%20Origins%20of%20Political%20Beliefs)&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110701b714ec09dbc7@[213.7.133.55]&gt;">talon57@well.com</a>&gt;,

<p><em>&gt;I was a bigger Mars enthusiast a year or so ago then I am now, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attended a lecture at the Adler planetarium (and dinner afterwords)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with noted Mars expert Dr Chris McKay. He made the (excellent)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point that he thought regular trips to Mars should wait until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represented the same cost ratio that Antartica represents now.
</em><br>
<p>Chris used to be a full-human-presence-on-Mars-as-soon-as-possible
<br>
advocate. Now he's become more realistic!
<br>
<p>But accordiing to Freeman Dyson, why go to Mars at all? Stay
<br>
at Antartica ...
<br>
<p>(from &quot;Warm-Blooded Plants and Freeze-Dried Fish&quot;, November 1997,
<br>
Atlantic Monthly)
<br>
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97nov/space.htm">http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97nov/space.htm</a>
<br>
<p>[paragraph begins with a description of the &quot;Mars rock&quot;]
<br>
<p>&quot;The evidence that these traces [of life in the Mars rock] have
<br>
anything to do with biology is highly dubious; we cannot say on the
<br>
basis of it that life must have existed on Mars. These traces are
<br>
important for two other reasons.
<br>
<p>First, if we are seriously
<br>
interested in finding evidence of life on Mars, we now know that
<br>
Mars rocks on Earth are the most convenient place to look for it.
<br>
Instead of waiting for many years for an expensive sampling mission
<br>
to land on Mars and return a few small chips of rock to Earth, we
<br>
can find a supply of bigger chips lying in Antarctica, where
<br>
meteorites accumulate on the ice and are freely available.
<br>
<p>Second,
<br>
these rocks show that if life was established on Mars at any time in
<br>
the past, it could have been transported to Earth intact. In the
<br>
first billion years after the solar system was formed, when Mars had
<br>
a warm climate and abundant water, asteroid impacts were much more
<br>
frequent than they are now. Mars rocks fell on Earth in great
<br>
numbers, and many Earth rocks must also have fallen on Mars. We
<br>
should not be surprised if we find that life, wherever it
<br>
originated, spread rapidly from one planet to another. Whatever
<br>
creatures we may find on Mars will probably be either our ancestors
<br>
or our cousins.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S. As far as we know, our Galileo dust detector has not sampled
<br>
Freeze-Dried Fish yet.
