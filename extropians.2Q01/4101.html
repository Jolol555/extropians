<p>Exactly. I would say we owe no allegiance to any abstraction, be it 
<br>
'humanity', 'Homo sapiens', 'western civilization', &lt;insert suitable national 
<br>
state&gt; or even 'progress'. Abstractions are abstractions and should not be 
<br>
regarded as goals in themselves. On the other hand, I think most of us think 
<br>
that progress is good because it benefits us and enables more valued things 
<br>
to come into existence and that it is a good thing if our species/descendant 
<br>
species survive since we care about the survival of ourselves, our children 
<br>
and our creations.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Death is death is death. Natural selection is all well and good, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten us this far. However, it's capricious, and it's cruel. The idea that
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm not certain the choice of nonbeing is always wrong, but it should be a 
<br>
choice, not a necessity. I think we are in the long run aided more by the 
<br>
love of life than the aversion of death - fear of becoming dead is good for 
<br>
making us avoid individual actions and specific threats, but love of life is 
<br>
a better guide to the more complex and long-range choices. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the point that you are wanting to make is that natural selection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more efficient than the alternative, whatever that may be. I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's necessarily so. The idea of becoming transhuman is that we can shape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves as we see fit, and as is best to meet the challenges of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. We can use many tools to do this, simulated natural selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amongst them. Plain vanilla natural selection (ie: kill lots of intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings, repeat) is an extremely slow way to improve our fitness in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe. It would be ludicrous to suppose, for example, that you could put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a population of practically immortal transhumans next to a population of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally evolving humans, and expect the &quot;natural&quot; humans to compete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution is fine, fabulous. Natural selection is clumsy, slow, tyranical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and incredibly inefficient. Take it down from the pedestal.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. Whether evolution works well or not depends a lot on the fitness 
<br>
landscape - if it is smooth and has a good kind of modularity it works well. 
<br>
But we want to move into new fitness landscapes, where evolution would be a 
<br>
less suitable guide.
