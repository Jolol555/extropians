<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; If there were no shortage, your salaries/rates would be lower than they

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Then, where would the incentive be to get people from overseas? &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, so basically you approve of a pay cap for domestic workers based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global competition, because the domestic workers demand too much. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much the view that I expected of those of a libertarian economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy, and who is to say you are wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the above suggesting that at all. And it doesn't have a
<br>
thing to do with being a libertarian.  A libertarian believes that
<br>
whatever the free market determines is the rate for programmers is a
<br>
fair rate, period.  I don't see naything there about any cap. Or did you
<br>
mean gap?  If you can find qualified programmers for less elsewhere then
<br>
great.  As a software engineer/ CS type I have no problem with that.  I
<br>
have a strong feel from my two decades in this field just how strong the
<br>
demand for software talent is and how difficult it is to find/train
<br>
really good software people. So I don't expect the price to plummet with
<br>
more overseas workers coming in hardly at all. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But all should be forced to compete in the global market. Why not bring in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million medical professionals to take care of us in the USA? What about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sweetheart deals could be set up between health insurance companies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pharmacy chains-halving costs? This could apply to legal services also. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean, why pay lawyers thousands of dollars when foreign attorneys could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more inexpensive? How about foreign  police and fire services? Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should these be exempt? :-)  Eh! Its a notion. Here is a link to a law firm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is dedicated to protect and promote foreign IT workers. Its a 'dated'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link but it provides a bit of info.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think it is mistaken to suppose that highly trained professionals in
<br>
many fields exist in huge abundance.  
<br>
<p>-s.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yah! This has been done by Microsoft, with its India based training centers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already, but there are contracting firms bringing significant numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign workers, anyway (see the law firm link above).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So where does that leave us? If Joe Corp executive has come to feel that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get quality work of imported foreign workers, it will delight his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shareholders if such occurs-more money in the short term. Notice how H1-Bs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never applies to managers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Supposedly, 5.6 million new IT workers will be needed in the USA in the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5 years. Gates and company may have a point, if true. If not....?
