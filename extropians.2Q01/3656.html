I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If persons now living do manage to get past the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; next couple of centuries, nothing prevents them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from establishing numerous copies of themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; throughout the universe, and the chance of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all being taken out... is quite small.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; And some folks, such as Freeman Dyson, have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; talking a long time about physics that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; support an infinite amount of computation.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ultimate source for these considerations is Tipler
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>and this harmless reference to Tipler drew some fire.
<br>
I was not appealing to authority, but rather to Tipler's
<br>
book as a source of materials for arguments in favor of
<br>
an infinite amount of computation perhaps being possible.
<br>
<p>I had begun to get the impression, from a number of posts
<br>
(for example on Eternal Return) that people on this list
<br>
had not read &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;.  I see that I
<br>
was wrong---sorry about that.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick wrote of Emlyn's remark
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If Tipler said it, it's gotta be right I guess ;-)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; A richly deserved smiley. If Tipler said it, it's almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly gotta be wrong.  There's nothing more uncomfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than building your theodicy on the wrong shaped spacetime.
</em><br>
<p>Two points.  I'm sure that you aren't serious about something
<br>
having to be wrong because Tipler said it.  I know that you're
<br>
in chat mode---but even so...
<br>
<p>Secondly, perhaps you can inform me where Tipler's conjectures
<br>
about the collapse of space at the end of time have been debunked.
<br>
I have always regarded such &quot;calculations&quot; with a lot of skepticism,
<br>
but don't have any prior reason for supposing that humankind or
<br>
intelligence in the universe to be incapable of having an enormous
<br>
influence on the fate of the universe, including, possibly its
<br>
very topology under collapse.
<br>
<p>Let me guess: what's really bugging people is not Tipler's physics
<br>
nor his conjectures, but the religious slant he puts on everything.
<br>
I also am appalled, and argue against Tipler on this point with my
<br>
friends (some of whom think that he's doing nothing wrong, e.g.
<br>
Peter McCluskey).  But concretely, why do you suppose that infinite
<br>
computation, which was how we got onto this subject, is unlikely?
<br>
I still think that no one knows enough to say a whole lot one way
<br>
or the other.
