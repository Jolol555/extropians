<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Sysop%20vs.%20Liberty%20(was%20Re:%20How%20To%20Live%20In%20A%20Simulation)&In-Reply-To=&lt;F780jCaXj97vPYGrN7k00002f28@hotmail.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;My Standing Challenge is as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Name one concrete thing that you should be able to do, but that a Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;won't let you do.&quot;  It can't be an intangible quality, like &quot;having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nanobots fully under my control&quot; - you have to name something specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you want to do with those nanobots, but which you won't be able to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under the Sysop Scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No decrement of freedom is involved.
</em><br>
<p>suppose i want to model some intelligences. they're human equivalent, or 
<br>
maybe a little less than human level, in an abstract environment, to 
<br>
investigate a minor point in game theory that i think is relevant to optimal 
<br>
intelligence. In the course of the simulation, most of them will be hurt. at 
<br>
the end of the simulation, i'll reclaim the mass involved, effectively 
<br>
killing them all. Does the Sysop give an API error when i attempt this 
<br>
experiment?
<br>
<p>If it does, then the implication is that i'm restricted from thinking about 
<br>
intelligences if i have the cycles neccesary to *model* them. I start 
<br>
thinking about an intelligence, and if i do so in sufficient detail, then 
<br>
the sysop grants it *sysopian citizenship* and suddenly i can't control what 
<br>
happens to my own internal model? if so, then i'm restricted to thinking 
<br>
about intelligences below a certain level of sophistication. and if i do so, 
<br>
then an amount of &quot;my&quot; computronium, is suddenly beyond my control. which 
<br>
understandably might piss me off.
<br>
<p>if this is a repeat scenario, please send me a pointer to the appropriate 
<br>
archive.
<br>
<p>i KNOW this is a repeat, but i have to ask, assuming above scenario,(or at 
<br>
least something else that pisses me off) why can't i just run from sysopian 
<br>
space. it's control over things has to decrease with distance, unless it's 
<br>
got some funky physics goin on. Can't i just run as fast as i can, 
<br>
increasing my own intelligence/control/flexibility/tech until my lower level 
<br>
of competence can compete with sysop-at-a-distance competence, effectively 
<br>
&quot;breaking free&quot;.
<br>
<p>((please also send me appropriate archive point, if this is really old hat))
