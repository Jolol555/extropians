This has been done several times. They seem to be treating it as 
<br>
first-time ever(?) The term &quot;body transplant&quot; has been suggested to 
<br>
make the whole thing seem less, well...ghoulish.
<br>
<p>I believe someone was asking about animal experimentation..?

<em>&gt; Frankenstein fears after head transplant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A new brain could be available in the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A controversial operation to transplant the whole head of a monkey onto a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different body has proved a partial success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The scientist behind it wants to do the same thing to humans, but other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the scientific community have condemned the experiments as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;grotesque&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Professor Robert White, from Cleveland Ohio, transplanted a whole monkey's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head onto another monkey's body, and the animal survived for some time after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the operation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The professor told the BBC's Today programme how he believes the operation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the next step in the transplant world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And he raised the possibility that it could be used to treat people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paralysed and unable to use their limbs, and whose bodies, rather than their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains, were diseased.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;People are dying today who, if they had body transplants, in the spinal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; injury community would remain alive.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He said that in the experiment, his team had been able to: &quot;transplant the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain as a separate organ into an intact animal and maintain it in a viable, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or living situation for many days.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He added: &quot;We've been able to retain the brain in the skull, and in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That, he said meant the monkey was conscious, and that it could see, hear, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taste and smell because the nerves were left intact in the head.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He admitted that it could appear &quot;grotesque&quot;, but said there had been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical considerations throughout the history of organ transplants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;At each stage - kidney, heart, liver and so forth - ethical considerations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been considered, especially with the heart, which was a major, major 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem for many people and scientists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;And the brain, because of its uniqueness poses a major, major ethical issue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as the public and even the profession is concerned.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Scientifically misleading'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The arguments against head and brain transplants were outlined by Dr Stephen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rose, director of brain and behavioural research at the Open University.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He said: &quot;This is medical technology run completely mad and out of all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportion to what's needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's entirely misleading to suggest that a head transplant or a brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transplant is actually really still connected in anything except in terms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blood stream to the body to which it has been transplanted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's not controlling or relating to that body in any other sort of way.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He added: &quot;It's scientifically misleading, technically irrelevant and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientifically irrelevant, and apart from anything else a grotesque breach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any ethical consideration.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's a mystification to call it either a head transplant or a brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transplant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;All you're doing is keeping a severed head alive in terms of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circulation from another animal. It's not connected in any nervous sense.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The issue of who someone who had received a head transplant would &quot;be&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely complicated, said Professor Rose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Your person is largely embodied but not entirely in your brain&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He added: &quot;I cannot see any medical grounds for doing this. I cannot see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that scientifically you would actually be able to regenerate the nerves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which could produce that sort of control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;And I think that the experiments are the sort that are wholly unethical and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inappropriate for any possible reason.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He added that the way to help the quadriplegic community was to work on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research to help spinal nerves regenerate.
