Lee wrote in response:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The flaw in your argument (...)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It may help to consider that from the mathematician's perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are actually three types of parents, not four. (...)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; But you have formatted the most substantial-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sounding objection I've heard. Thanks for the critical thinking.
</em><br>
------------
<br>
<p>First, I realize that in my previous message (Re:  I disagree with Lee's
<br>
answer), I was a bit disrespectful of Lee's views.  I apologize.
<br>
<p>However, Lee, instead of pointing it out (which is the best course of action
<br>
in such cases), responds in kind, which I quoted above.
<br>
<p>Lee, your long argument in favour of your answer is not needed.  I don't
<br>
need your &quot;help&quot;.  Of course I saw your argument immediately.  If you read
<br>
my message carefully, you will see I said
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The answer to this is of course 2/3
</em><br>
<p>Anybody with common sense or probability training or intelligence, will
<br>
quickly arrive at this answer.  This list is comprised of people who want to
<br>
preserve their thinking, therefore there must be something worth preserving,
<br>
and so questions such as these are not &quot;fun&quot; as you claim, but boring - in
<br>
my humble opinion.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
Now, to the argument.  Lee responds:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The flaw in your argument is that the mathematician is obligated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entertain no hypotheses concerning the procedure by which the parent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determined the truth or falsity of the statement &quot;one of my children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a girl&quot;. The only thing that matters is whether the statement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true. It's not the case that the father is saying &quot;I have picked...&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I agree of course that the mathematician is obligated to entertain no
<br>
hypotheses in addition to what the father said.  But you are now quoting
<br>
only part of the father's statement.  Let me quote the whole relevant
<br>
statement that you wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>and I responded
<br>
<em>&gt;Note the pair of phrases:&gt;&quot;one&quot;, and &quot;the other&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Lee, did you carefully read your original message and this response??  Why
<br>
do I have to keep repeating them?
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p>So, finally,  I think this is a good question for the linguists.  Are there
<br>
any linguists on the list?  Or anybody knows good linguists??
<br>
<p>The question is:  take the statement:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;I have two children, sir&quot;, he says, &quot;and one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     is a girl.  What is the probability that the other is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     a boy?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>In this statement, does the person:
<br>
<p>1.  focus on one particular child and then on the other child? (in this case
<br>
the answer is 1/2)
<br>
2.  does not focus on any particular child at any time (in this case the
<br>
answer is 2/3)
<br>
3.  it is ambiguous and cannot be inferred whether he does or does not focus
<br>
(in this case the original question that Lee posed is ambigous)
<br>
<p>So, linguists, please respond...  Thank you.
<br>
<p>Mark Galecki
