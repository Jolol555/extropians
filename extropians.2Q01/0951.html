<p>No, that's not right. It would suffice if there was something that is just 
<br>
making you think you see what you see. Given what little we know about (such 
<br>
figments of our non-existing imagination as) aphasias and ataxias, tweaking 
<br>
representational systems will be negligable work for an SI. Whether you see 
<br>
a flock of wild geese, or pink furred Dumbos, it's a diff of a few bits, if 
<br>
you happen to live in fakeland.

</em><br>
<p>True, a brute force sim tends to do all the work explicitly. However,
<br>
this is not a problem if you have brute force to spare, and can afford
<br>
to run lightyears over lightyears of Planck scale-sized voxels without
<br>
even exerting yourself. Remember, what you learned to think of as 
<br>
expensive, is based on a denizen's view.

<em>&gt; Oops, sorry, I see the rest of your post is jestfully taking a position

</em><br>
<p>I think the simulation argument to be exceedingly sterile. Barring evidence,
<br>
it's not worth sparing you're neurotransmitters over. God knows there are
<br>
more pressing issues at hand.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since when are we limited to direct sensoric experience?  There's lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people investigating this in sophisticated ways.  Are you seriously proposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solipcism?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not. I think it's silly.
<br>
<p>However, if one is taking the fool's view, there's no point in going half-way.
<br>
Let's take the plunge all the way down, doppler-shifted screaming all along.
<br>
Whatever you're seeing is passed through the bottlenecks of your senses, and
<br>
whatever you'll find in your memory. Worse, it's what you think you think you
<br>
think and remember. Given (such mythical characters you think you've read) as 
<br>
Sacks and Luria, don't you think an SI puppet-player will make you jump around 
<br>
and say/think/believe whatever it pleases?
<br>
<p>Okay, now back to our regular programme, and pray pay no attention to the man 
<br>
behind the curtain.
