</em><br>
<p>OK, yes, we do take a position on that point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've been reading some of the papers in your references, and the way

</em><br>
<p>Happy to see you reading on this.  Most of the literature does deal with
<br>
some stable end of a conversation, but one paper does not.   See:
<br>
<p>&quot;Disagreement is unpredictable&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/unpredict.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/unpredict.pdf</a> or .ps
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I was asking about disagreement above, I was talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial stage in this process, when you first discover that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different posterior beliefs.  What is the best approach to resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dispute?  The methods I have seen so far (as in the paper above)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are quite impractical for human beings to apply IMO as they seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require excessively detailed knowledge about the state of the world.
</em><br>
<p>Practice rational reasoning involves lots of error-prone reasoning
<br>
disciplined by meta-processes that look for and correct for systematic
<br>
biases.  <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/disagree.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/disagree.html</a> talks more about this.
<br>
Psychologists have studied this a lot.  See &quot;Metacognition&quot; and the
<br>
&quot;flexible correction model&quot;.   If you find that your disagreement is
<br>
predictable, I think you should think of that as having uncovered a
<br>
systematic bias to correct for.   In general, you just more your beliefs
<br>
in the opposite direction from the bias you perceive.
