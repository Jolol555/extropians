<p>
Got this in the mail from a well-meaning friend. Actually it sounds
<br>
like a fun idea, but they've ruined it by making it an attack
<br>
against the president. As is typical of what passes for liberal
<br>
thought. 
<br>
<p>I'm going to send this to <a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov?Subject=Re:%20A%20voluntary%20blackout?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200105221423.HAA11665@well.com&gt;">president@whitehouse.gov</a>, maybe he'll
<br>
turn this on them by endorsing the idea.
<br>
<p>I've already read and enjoyed the book mentioned, and have been a
<br>
past contributor to the Rocky Mountain Institute (Amory and Hunter
<br>
Lovins) and a vocal proponent of the hypercar/hypertruck project.
<br>
My electric bill averages less than $15.00 a month and has never
<br>
exceeded $20.00, so I don't just talk-the-talk.
<br>
<p>There was an interesting statistic out awhile ago that twice as
<br>
many Republicans are driving the Honda Insight as Democrats.
<br>
<p><p><p>ROLL YOUR OWN BLACKOUT
<br>
THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER
<br>
JUNE 21, 2001 THURS EVE,
<br>
7-10pm worldwide, all time zones
<br>
<p>As an alternative to George W. Bush's energy policies and lack of
<br>
emphasis on efficiency, conservation and alternative fuels, there
<br>
will be a voluntary rolling blackout on the first day of summer,
<br>
June 21 at  7pm - 10pm in any time zone (this will roll it across
<br>
the planet).
<br>
<p>Its a simple protest and a symbolic act. Turn out your lights from
<br>
7pm-10pm on June 21. Unplug whatever you can unplug in your house.
<br>
Light a candle to the Sungoddess, kiss and tell or not, take a
<br>
stroll in the dark, invent ghost stories, anything that's not
<br>
electronic - have fun in the dark.
<br>
<p>Read the 1999 book &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot; by Hawken and Lovins to
<br>
learn that conservation/high efficiency technologies already ARE
<br>
on-the-shelf. If implemented these revolutionary ideas would pay
<br>
themselves off within five years, after which we'd be pumping far
<br>
less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere and saving bucks to boot.
<br>
<p>Forward this email as widely as possible, to friends, to your
<br>
government representatives and environmental contacts. Let them
<br>
know we want global education, participation in, and funding for
<br>
conservation, efficiency and alternative fuel efforts -- and an end
<br>
the misuse of the earth's resources.
