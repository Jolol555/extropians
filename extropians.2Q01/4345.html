<p><em>&gt;True.  But if one practices explaining it to oneself as one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explain it to a novice, or a child (if that metaphor is clearer), then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one can find ways to explain it to others easier...and, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infrequently, come to understand it better oneself.  At least, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used this technique myself when faced with confusing collections of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facts, and I feel that I understand those things better as a result,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though I am not certain how I could objectively test this.  I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found that for even the most difficult problems, repeating this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technique has allowed me to eventually boil anything I have tried it on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down to layman's terms.  This happens most often through a combination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of finding commonly-used terms that adequately describe a concept, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;finding commonly known concepts with a small and clearly describable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;set of differences from the concept being explained, and of determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what large sections of complexity can be reduced to a few statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while hiding the details from the basic explanation (with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding that, if those details are desired, they can be requested
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after the basics are digested).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Isn't it a bit more complicated? The big problem with explaining something
<br>
IMO is 1. what prior knowledge you assume on the part of the explainee 2.
<br>
what vocabulary is avaiable for you to explain it in simple terms (what
<br>
building blocks you have) The two clearly interact. One of my worst ever
<br>
experiences was trying to explain to an American what a &quot;googly&quot; is. Took me
<br>
an entire afternoon, much drawing of diagrams and an exposition of the
<br>
entire laws and basis of the game of cricket. The simple explanation &quot;It's
<br>
an offbreak bowled with a legbreak action&quot; wouldn't do! That case also
<br>
reveals another problem, misleading or irrelevant knowledge on the part of
<br>
the explainee - it's more difficult to explain cricket to an American
<br>
because they have misleading notions derived from baseball (exactly the same
<br>
in reverse by the way).
