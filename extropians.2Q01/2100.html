<em>&gt; Amara has so aptly described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the feeling as staring into the abyss until it stares back.
</em><br>
<p>When it stares back, does that make it a closed system?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The students did eventually agree on this mind boggling point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so we then asked ourselves what if the universe is open?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dropped out at that point, saying that this possibility is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sad to even consider.  {8-]  spike
</em><br>
<p>How can we know if reality is open or closed, and also determine if we live in
<br>
a simulation?
<br>
<p>Nasruddin puzzled himself thus:
<br>
&quot;Last night I dreamed that I was a butterfly. It was such a lucid dream that
<br>
now I can't decide whether I'm a man who dreamed of being a butterfly, or a
<br>
butterfly dreaming that she is a man.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That's easy,&quot; replied Nasruddin to himself. If something has a beginning and
<br>
end, then it's only a dream, it's just a story, a piece of fiction. That which
<br>
has no beginning and no end is reality. Naturally, this makes sense only to
<br>
someone who has direct experience of that which has no beginning and no end,
<br>
IOW, reality.
<br>
<p>The description you've provided of closed system cosmos looks mighty
<br>
fine to me, Spike, and I really appreciate the way you filled in the standard
<br>
details. Do you really think open-endedness so sad? What prevents reality
<br>
being so energetically open that it's infinite in all directions (a little
<br>
Dysonese there), including hyperspace, so that it includes an infinite number
<br>
of *closed* universes/multiverses? Reality open at both ends means open
<br>
topographically and temporally, a hyper-spacetime continuum that's open to the
<br>
infinitesimal as well as the infinite, and the past as well as the future.
<br>
Color me contraire, but an &quot;open&quot; system that has a definite beginning and
<br>
infinite future doesn't seem as open as one with no beginning and no end.
<br>
<p>As a theory of everything, Eternal Recurrence seems somehow anti-climactic,
<br>
and disappointingly free of math, but then intelligence needs reality much
<br>
more than reality needs intelligence, so we can't expect existence to
<br>
entertain intelligence forever (only stoned couch potatoes and sf fanatics
<br>
expect that).
<br>
<p>&quot;I have stared into the abyss, and it is us.&quot;
<br>

<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
