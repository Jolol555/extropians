<p><em>&gt;&gt; but they would grant asylum if they thought the conviction

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Has Canada or any other country actually granted U.S. citizens asylum from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the U.S. government?
</em><br>
<p>Western European countries have refused to extradite people subject to
<br>
possible execution in the US.  Not quite asylum but it's close.  I can't
<br>
think of any explicit asylum grants, nor could I find any browsing the
<br>
Web.  I did find two denials - a Communist in the Netherlands and a 
<br>
medical marijuana advocate in BC.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I may be more jaded, but I don't think the U.S. would ever grant asylum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a country we were friendly with.  I think we only use asylum against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries that we accuse of systemic human rights abuses.  If we or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries started intervening into individual cases on their own merits,it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would become politically difficult.  I would expect government officials
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to avoid these kinds of difficulties at all costs.
</em><br>
<p>There was a recent case where a Mexican transexual applied for asylum
<br>
based on the grounds that Mexican police had threatened their life.
<br>
I don't know if it was granted, but it was at least seriously considered.
<br>
The government officials were rather distressed at having to deal with
<br>
the problem, but once the asylum petition is made they no longer have
<br>
a good way to dodge it.
