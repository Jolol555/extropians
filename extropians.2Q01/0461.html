</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   which raises an interesting issue (and I invite comment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the ladies as well)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What does it do to the psychology of the privileged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; male to be able to fundamentally and completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divorce the reproductive functions of the female
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the emotional/sexual portions of the usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; male/female dynamic...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  without in any way sacrificing the father's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic continuity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   For instance...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  A certain sort of female I find sexually attractive...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this type seldom overlaps with the type I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would prefer to mingle genes with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Neither of these types is usually congruent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ideal for child-bearing (in a gestational sense)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and often (for a variety of reasons) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;nurture/caregiver&quot; role as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   The &quot;bon vivant waif&quot; of lust is not (usually) the neurosurgeon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or physicist whose genes are ideal. The girl genius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually has a career, not ideal for a full time mom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (understandably so).  The fashion plate often has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baggage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But when the professional male can pick a womb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a nanny (possibly in the same body) without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choosing a bedmate or a genetic mother in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; package.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How does THIS change the game?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Doesn't it seem consistent with the paring down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of family size, paring down from tribe, to extended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family, to nuclear family....?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What comes after the nuclear family?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes life is so damn cool!

</em><br>
<p>Given an average healthy pair of a human male and female, the male has
<br>
thousands upon thousands of sperm, per day, while the female has a
<br>
lifetime supply of maybe hundreds of eggs.
<br>
<p>Basically, the women have the only functional human reproductive system
<br>
in the planet, the women basically have total control of reproduction.
<br>
That is a qualified statement.
<br>
<p>By the same token, more men are in positions of relative &quot;power&quot;, or so
<br>
the media would have us believe.  So, some people in power are corrupt.
<br>
<p>So, the point is to be a male brain surgeon, that way the women want
<br>
your genes for their children, or to have a nice car.
<br>
<p>The ways of human attraction are many and varied.
<br>
<p>Some women are very sexist, much like racial attitudes are often
<br>
prevalent in those subject to them.  That is not to say that the other
<br>
side is without fault, far from it.
<br>
<p>So, fighting racism and sexism means conflict.
<br>
<p>Because our society is patronymic, it is.
<br>
<p>I don't think I want a clone, it would be somewhat like inbreeding.  I'd
<br>
be happy to donate a cloned &quot;good sperm&quot; to a wide variety of screened
<br>
candidates.  If I have the option to select a sperm cell to impregnate,
<br>
then it would have to have a better method than the &quot;survival of the
<br>
fittest&quot; natural selection of natural insemination.
