<em>&gt; &gt;Not so. Most atheists I've met would not say &quot;god doesn't exist&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they would say they don't believe it exists. They're well aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the problem of making such sweeping claims. By default,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;atheism is merely a lack of god belief. It can also be a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;assertion of nonexistence&quot;, but this in my experience is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;less common, and atheism tends to be described that way in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to strawman it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Atheism is not merely a lack of God belief, it is a belief that God
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Webster's Universal College Dictionary:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Atheism: The doctrine or belief that there is no God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Atheist: A person who denies or disbelieves in the existance of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supreme being or beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The version most &quot;atheists&quot; you know believe is closer to what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought agnostic meant. I guess we have a golden opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;define a new term.
</em><br>
<p><p>Theism - Belief in a god
<br>
Atheism - *Lacking*, or without, or having no, belief in a god or gods
<br>
Agnostic - One who claims the nature of god is unknown and probably 
<br>
unknowable ie. Lacking knowledge.
<br>
<p>Just because a dictionary lists it as &quot;belief in no gods&quot; doesn't make it 
<br>
the general usage or the word, or the correct one.  Many have listed 
<br>
atheism in this incorrect form and gone further, linking it to words such 
<br>
as &quot;wickedness&quot; (inaccurate, even in a historical sense).  Perhaps we might 
<br>
ask if it is an atheist who writes this definition?  Perhaps you'd like to 
<br>
justify these &quot;definitions&quot; based on them being in a dictionary, and 
<br>
therefore must be correct?
<br>
<p>The 1966 edition of Webster's on my lap also lists &quot;freethinker&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;unbeliever&quot; and &quot;infidel&quot; under the entry for atheism.  Its' entry for 
<br>
unbeliever more accurately describes atheism - &quot;unbeliever is a more 
<br>
negative term, simply designating, without further qualification, one who 
<br>
does not accept and religious belief.&quot;  It seems Webster's has made little 
<br>
progress with this definition in the intervening years.
<br>
<p>Most non-believers I know are atheists, not agnostics.  They make no claims 
<br>
as to the &quot;knowability&quot; of gods.  They simply lack belief in them.
<br>
<p>No need to define a new term Brian, its' usage is known and used by those 
<br>
who are most qualified to use it; atheists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We appear to believe the same thing, but neither the textbook
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definitions for agnostic nor atheist seem to cover it.
</em><br>
<p>Right you are, they don't really cover it, and are often wrong...or insulting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Seems to me like the death penalty is more a case of legalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;communal revenge than anything to do with justice. The idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a Govt. can actually kill someone is disturbing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The idea is to keep individuals from acting on their own, speaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of that, check this out:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From the May issue of REASON.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Barbara Graham was a speaker at last year's million mom march and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a member of the group that co-sponsored that rally for gun control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now a District of Columbia court has convicted her of shooting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;man she thought killed her son. Her victim, who police say was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the murderer, is now paralyzed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Contrary to some peoples opinion I think the death penalty will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a negative reinforcing effect (or deterrent) when it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applied at the same level at which the crime occurs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are something like two murders a day in Chicago, but we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not execute anything like that number. Everything we've learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from psychology to cybernetics has told us we can't expect any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change at this low level of reinforcement.
</em><br>
<p>Not sure what's being said here, but it seems to me something like 
<br>
&quot;tit-for-tat&quot; under the justification of &quot;deterrent&quot;.  Sounds just like 
<br>
what terrorists in NI used to justify their &quot;executions&quot; and &quot;punishments&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'm not interested in negative reinforcing effects;  I'm concerned with 
<br>
Human rights.  And I don't think any Government has the privilege of 
<br>
killing its' citizens on the basis of some &quot;deterrent&quot; value, valid or 
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
<p>James...
<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
