For those of you who may have missed this (I can't imagine how!), here's a 
<br>
report on the recent conference in Rome at which near-term attempts at human 
<br>
cloning were discussed.
<br>
<p>I find the following passage especaily interesting: &quot;]Zavos] said the group 
<br>
has 'unlimited' funding from unidentified private sources and would handle 
<br>
its own quality control. 'We don't want the government involved in this 
<br>
project,' he said.&quot;  I wonder who is the money behind this and if they're 
<br>
thinking ahead to secure private funding of facilities to research, develop 
<br>
and deploy human augmentation technologies.  If anyone has specific 
<br>
information about these questions, feel free to contact me off-list.

<p>Forum on Human Cloning Turns Raucous
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Europe: Doctors say they're forging ahead with plan to create children for
<br>
clients. The idea draws criticism on ethical and scientific grounds.
<br>
<p>By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, Times Staff Writer
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROME--In a scientific forum punctuated by shouting matches, three
<br>
doctors from the United States, Italy and Israel told critics Friday that
<br>
nothing can stop their plan to create cloned children and said that more
<br>
than 600 infertile couples have already signed up with them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The would-be pioneers disclosed little new information about their
<br>
semisecret project, announced six weeks ago, and spurned the idea of
<br>
submitting to ethical or scientific oversight by any government.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, they spent four polemic-filled hours either belittling rival
<br>
researchers and wary politicians or trying to convince them--and a skeptical
<br>
public--that science is ready to move on to cloning humans despite a
<br>
disturbing rate of disease and deformities in similarly reproduced animals.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some claim that we're moving too fast. They are right,&quot; Dr. Avi
<br>
Ben-Abraham, an American Israeli biotechnologist, told a packed lecture hall
<br>
bristling with TV news cameras from around the world. &quot;We are moving as fast
<br>
as we can think, as fast as we can imagine, [but] we are proceeding with the
<br>
utmost responsibility.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is led by Dr. Severino Antinori of Italy, who has already
<br>
pushed the boundaries of fertility treatment by helping women become
<br>
pregnant in their late 50s and early 60s. He and Dr. Panayiotis M. Zavos, an
<br>
American reproductive physiologist who has just left the University of
<br>
Kentucky, announced their project Jan. 25, apparently becoming the first
<br>
specialists in reproduction to publicly set the goal of cloning a human
<br>
being.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Friday's forum in Rome, organized to publicize and advance the
<br>
project, Ben-Abraham introduced himself as the third member of the team. He
<br>
is a practitioner of cryonics--which involves freezing people at death in
<br>
the hope that science will one day be able to afford them resurrection--and
<br>
lost a race for Israel's parliament in 1999.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloning is a process for creating a genetic twin of an individual.
<br>
Scientists start with an egg cell, remove the egg's DNA, then insert DNA or
<br>
even a whole cell from the adult being duplicated into the egg. When the
<br>
process works, the egg cell begins dividing and grows into an embryo, which
<br>
is then transferred to a natural or surrogate mother and grown to term--just
<br>
the way human &quot;test-tube&quot; babies are produced at fertility clinics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the four years since the arrival of Dolly, the famous sheep and the
<br>
first cloned mammal, scientists have cloned cows, pigs, mice and other
<br>
animals. But for every successful birth, they have lost dozens who fail to
<br>
grow in the womb, don't survive birth or die soon after birth from
<br>
deformities.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driven by fear of similar risks to human clones or ethical objections
<br>
to the idea of reproducing humans in such a manner, many governments have
<br>
moved to restrict or ban human cloning.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition echoed Friday inside and outside the narrow lecture hall at
<br>
Umberto I Policlinic, Rome's largest hospital.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How can you take the destiny of the human race into your hands?&quot;
<br>
Fabrizia Pratesi, a leader of Italy's Green Party, asked from the audience.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No provocations, please,&quot; the moderator warned her. &quot;Just scientific
<br>
questions.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going to be very provocative!&quot; Pratesi shouted, seconds before her
<br>
microphone went dead. &quot;All the major organizations of human society oppose
<br>
human cloning. It's unthinkable.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proceedings were disrupted again when a doctor in a white coat
<br>
rose, over the moderator's objections, to read a disapproving letter from
<br>
the head of the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department. He branded
<br>
the event &quot;inopportune and reprehensible.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the disorder, a Harvard-educated scientist, Dr. Richard G. Seed,
<br>
got up and said he wanted to clone his wife.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizers of the forum had billed it as an ethical discussion that
<br>
might help guide their work and would include participation by an unnamed
<br>
Roman Catholic cardinal. No church official came, but Bishop Elio Sgreccia,
<br>
head of the John Paul II Institute for Bioethics in Rome, assailed the
<br>
project from a distance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those who made the atomic bomb went ahead in spite of knowing about
<br>
its terrible destruction,&quot; he said from his office in Rome's Gemelli
<br>
Hospital. &quot;This doesn't mean it was the best choice for humanity.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antinori, the project leader, spent part of the question-and-answer
<br>
session fending off such criticism. He shouted down visiting researchers and
<br>
reporters who raised ethical questions about the project.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to opposition to cloning in Germany and Japan, he told a
<br>
Japanese reporter: &quot;Germany did horrible experiments during World War II, so
<br>
they probably have a sense of guilt. Japan has psychological problems.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Italian fertility specialist and his colleagues tried to shift the
<br>
focus of debate to the quiet desires of infertile couples.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zavos said they have received &quot;thousands and thousands&quot; of e-mail
<br>
messages since their January announcement, and &quot;99.9% of them are positive.&quot;
<br>
Infertile couples in Japan, Argentina, Britain, the United States and
<br>
elsewhere want to take part in the cloning effort, he said, and the list of
<br>
volunteers is growing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They come to us and they don't call you names, they don't cuss you
<br>
out, they don't say, 'You're unethical,' &quot; Zavos said, pacing the lecture
<br>
hall like an evangelist giving a sermon. &quot;They just say, 'Help me, please.'
<br>
&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists said they would work only with couples who cannot bear
<br>
children by other means. They said they expect to produce a viable embryo
<br>
for cloning within 18 to 24 months but wouldn't disclose where they will set
<br>
up their lab. Zavos said the group is looking at &quot;around six countries,&quot;
<br>
including some in Europe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the group has &quot;unlimited&quot; funding from unidentified private
<br>
sources and would handle its own quality control. &quot;We don't want the
<br>
government involved in this project,&quot; he said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other scientists argue that the results of animal cloning so far
<br>
underscore the need for more research on animals before cloning is tried on
<br>
humans. Dr. Ian Wilmut, for example, says he lost 28 embryos from 277 eggs
<br>
before creating Dolly the sheep.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday, Zavos denounced Wilmut's method as &quot;irresponsible,&quot; saying
<br>
the Scottish scientist failed to screen his embryos properly before planting
<br>
them in prospective mothers. Drawing on techniques used during the 23-year
<br>
history of test-tube babies, Zavos said, his team is perfecting a screening
<br>
method to identify which embryos will grow successfully and which are bound
<br>
to fail.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Before Columbus reached America, a lot of shipwrecks took place,&quot; he
<br>
said, acknowledging that there will be failures. But he said the failure
<br>
rate should be in line with that of test-tube babies--one successful birth
<br>
for every three or four tries.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Robert P. Lanza, vice president of scientific development of
<br>
Advanced Cell Technology Inc. in Worcester, Mass., which has cloned cows and
<br>
goats, disputed the claim that Zavos and his team can screen for healthy
<br>
embryos.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's absolute nonsense. No one knows what's causing the problems,
<br>
let alone how to screen for them,&quot; he said. The statement that embryos can
<br>
be screened and the healthiest picked out &quot;is insulting. The world's top
<br>
cloning experts have spent years trying to do exactly that.&quot;
