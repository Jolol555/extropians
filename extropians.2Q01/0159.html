</em><br>
<em>&gt; its value is found in the realm of subjective experience, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective facts. Since we on this list are very fond of objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, we tend to miss the difference in emphasis.
</em><br>
<p>As the Buddha says in Hesse's _Siddhartha_, which I recommend all on this
<br>
list read, [his] doctrine is about overcoming suffering -- not truth.
<br>
<p>But truly the problem is with linking the idea of overcoming suffering with
<br>
faith.  If you show that link to be tenuous -- which would be no small
<br>
feat -- then you might have a better chance.
<br>
<p>(On this note, see my &quot;A Dialogue On Happiness&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Dialogue.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Dialogue.html</a>  This dialogue by no means
<br>
solves this problem.  It was not intended to, but it raises some of the
<br>
questions involved.  I think faith generally starts with skepticism; if one
<br>
can route skepticism, one can remove the need for faith.)
<br>
<p>Still, I don't argue with people about religion, especially people who are
<br>
older than their early 20s for the most part because those people are
<br>
settled and it takes to much time and effort to convince them to change.  Go
<br>
for the young!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Creo quia absurdum...
</em><br>
<p>Isn't it actually &quot;credo.&quot;:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
