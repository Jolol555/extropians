</em><br>
<p>You may be right, Anders.  However, I find people on this list too eager to
<br>
jump to that conclusion.  One of the most difficult things for a human
<br>
intellect to do is to discuss opposing viewpoints as if they are valid or
<br>
real.  The first instinct is too assume that the self is right and the other
<br>
is wrong.  Then natural next step is to assume the other must be stupid or
<br>
lying about their position.  Either way, it becomes deceptively easy to
<br>
dismiss the other position as not worthy of negotiation.
<br>
<p>It is hard to believe, but I have found that almost everybody really
<br>
believes in what they are doing.  Even insane people rarely act randomly,
<br>
but are actually reacting quite rationally to their distorted perceptions.
<br>
Sure, people get caught up in politics, enjoy a good fight, and become more
<br>
concerned with their ego than their goal.  We sometimes have that problem
<br>
here on this list.
<br>
<p>Even if one doesn't believe in animal rights or the ability to abolish
<br>
animal testing, I think the complaints are reasonable.  Animal testing is
<br>
horrible.  I would hate to think that any of these testers take a kitten
<br>
home just for the fun of doing private experiments as a form of
<br>
entertainment.  The fact is that animal testing is evil.  Those that do it
<br>
believe that it is the lesser of two evils, and that not curing human
<br>
ailments causes worse suffering.  If there were a way to achieve better
<br>
results without harming animals, I'm sure companies would jump on it.
<br>
<p>In other words, I don't think these complaints or objections are
<br>
unreasonable.  If they are misguided, we need to explain.  If they are
<br>
valid, we need to work toward a solution.  If they are deliberately
<br>
misleading, we need to expose them.  But we must resist the temptation to
<br>
dismiss them out of hand, or to not even try to respond.  At best, we might
<br>
miss some valid criticism, and at worst, we would appear to be nonresponsive
<br>
in the public eye and would be ineffective in countering such criticisms.
