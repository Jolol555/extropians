<p>We're not **really** on opposite sides of the fence here.
<br>
It's just a matter of emphasis and aesthetics, I think.  Your
<br>
paragraph above describes a sort of Eganesque scenario in which
<br>
uploading is well-established, cheap, and reliable
<br>
technology, like owning a computer and being on the
<br>
Internet is today in the U.S.  If it were the year
<br>
2975 in the world of _Diaspora_, would I seek out an
<br>
Introdus portal and join the world of the polises?  Yes,
<br>
almost certainly (I'm assuming it would be a Moravec
<br>
transfer; I **don't** want to be duplicated!).  I'd
<br>
have butterflies in my stomach, but I'd do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Worth preserving??? ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are going around and around on this.  &quot;VALUABLE TO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHOM?&quot;, I fairly want to scream.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, yes.  I was just trying to convey the flavor of a certain
<br>
insouciance or detachment that I affect, at least on a verbal
<br>
level, and which I think I genuinely feel, about the significance
<br>
of my own life.  I understand the objections that Eliezer, for one,
<br>
has to such an attitude of detachment towards human lives, and I
<br>
admire him for it in a way, even if I can't really bring myself to
<br>
share his earnestness.  Maybe that means that I'm morally underdeveloped,
<br>
and really not a very nice person.
<br>
<p>This detachment **doesn't** mean that I'm unsafe behind the
<br>
wheel of a car (I'm not like the brother in _Annie Hall_ ;-&gt; ),
<br>
that I don't look before crossing the street, that I don't pay
<br>
attention to what I eat, or go to the dentist regularly, or any of
<br>
the other things that ordinarily prudent people of American middle-class
<br>
means do.  It doesn't mean that I wouldn't be damn scared to be diagnosed
<br>
with cancer, say, or that I'm not dismayed by the evidence of physical
<br>
decay that being nearly 50 confronts me with every day.  It may mean
<br>
that I can contemplate, with more equanimity than some, the
<br>
prospect of sheer nonexistence.  I did step over the edge of that
<br>
cliff once upon a time, quite deliberately (I'm not suicidal any
<br>
more; haven't been in a long time; but it does cross my mind from
<br>
time to time that if that attempt had been successful, the evidence
<br>
that I had ever existed would be almost completely expunged from the
<br>
world by now -- I would be seldom, and hazily, remembered even by the
<br>
people who knew me in 1982; it makes me feel a bit like a ghost).
<br>
<p>It's this feeling of detachment that makes the idea of cryo, with its
<br>
air of desperate grasping at straws, of being willing to pay
<br>
a large monetary price for what seems like a pretty low
<br>
probability of payoff (and without, as I mentioned, the
<br>
possibility of avoiding discomfort on the near side, and possibly
<br>
on the far side, of death itself), distasteful to me (and, yes,
<br>
slightly comical, with media associations like _The Loved One_).
<br>
It's really just a matter of personal taste, though, and I brought it
<br>
up solely as an act of self-revelation, not in order to cast
<br>
aspersions on anybody else's choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you see what a transformation of values that cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stands for?  Nothing less than the repudiation of death for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all sentient beings.
</em><br>
<p>Weeelll...  It's not going to be cryo that ushers in **that**
<br>
revolution, any more than Charles Babbage's difference engine
<br>
could have ushered in the Internet revolution.  Show me that
<br>
cubic millimeter of computronium you mention above, then we'll
<br>
talk ;-&gt; .  Again, I don't want to get in anybody's face here,
<br>
but if you asked me if I honestly think anybody undergoing
<br>
cryonic suspension today has a chance in hell of being revived,
<br>
I'd have to say no -- it seems no more likely to me than that there's
<br>
some sort of Tiplerian Omega Point awaiting us all, whether
<br>
or not we want it or have bothered to sign up with Alcor (The
<br>
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised, incorruptible...).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The heart leads the mind, and if your heart were to whisper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you, &quot;It's all right to live forever, and it's all right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for everyone to live forever&quot;, can your mind really object?
</em><br>
<p>Not in principle, no.  I hope I don't sound like I'm
<br>
contradicting myself!
