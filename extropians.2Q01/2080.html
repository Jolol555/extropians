<p>Seems like the first paragraph you quoted essentially was a support for 
<br>
my assertion that it was important with an open society in famine
<br>
prevention, rather than evidence that the way this prevention works is
<br>
that it is the government that saves the day. 
<br>
<p>The seoond paragraph essentially says that it is not just the market
<br>
that fixes things, but also other forms of social interactions. I would
<br>
agree with that, but if I get your drift right Sen also thinks that
<br>
government interventions are necessary to fix emergency situations. I
<br>
don't quite buy that. What is needed when (say) the harvest is destroyed
<br>
is some sort of collective support in addition to the market and
<br>
individual acts, but this can very well be provided by many other
<br>
institutions than the government, like for example churches or
<br>
charities. The important thing is that in an open society such
<br>
institutions can emerge and do their good work, with less likeliehood of
<br>
being corrupted since the press and public will be able to track them
<br>
more closely. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I might add that Sen has one more Nobel Prize in Economics (1998) than we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.
</em><br>
<p>So? Just because you get a Nobel Prize doesn't make you right in every
<br>
issue, not even the details of your own winning contribution.
