<p>Ominous?   Cooool, Ive always wanted to be ominous.  Every time
<br>
you hear of an ominous donor giving money to something, you'll
<br>
know that was me.
<br>
<p>Im leading you to an apparent paradox, Lee.  The reason I mention
<br>
the C+2 problem it is this will lead you to the following:  Since
<br>
we have no reason to believe that the probability of C+2 is anything
<br>
other than 1 / ln(C+2), lets assume it so.  Now open a spreadsheet
<br>
to make this easier.  Get your two randomly chosen primes (neither
<br>
of which can be 2), multiply them together to generate the composite C.
<br>
Now fill down, C+2, C+4, and so on.  In the next column calculate
<br>
1 / ln {the first column}.  The second column is the probability of
<br>
each number to its left being prime.  Now calculate the cumulative
<br>
probability of C+2 and C+4 prime, then C+6 also prime, and so on.
<br>
<p>What did you find out?
<br>
<p>One of the many fascinating aspects of living when we do is that for
<br>
the first time in all human history, it is possible to make a prediction
<br>
about when the record for the largest known prime will be broken.  To
<br>
do this, all you need to know is the following:
<br>
<p>1.  Now and for all future time, the largest known prime will always
<br>
be a Mersenne prime, since there is no known way nor any anticipated
<br>
discovery that will allow megadigit non-Mersenne numbers to be tested
<br>
for primality.
<br>
<p>2.  You need to know the status of the GIMPS project, the Great
<br>
Internet Mersenne Primes Search.
<br>
<p>3.  You need to understand how to calculate the probability of a given
<br>
number of being prime, given that it is of the form 2^P-1 where P is
<br>
prime.
<br>
<p>4.  You also understand how to adjust the probability if the number has
<br>
already been checked for small factors {&quot;small&quot; being defined as factors
<br>
smaller than about 6 octillion}.
<br>
<p>When making the estimate for Damien's book, we had to make several
<br>
assumptions regarding the future of GIMPS, all of which were done
<br>
by extrapolation in May 2000.  We extrapolated the growth in
<br>
the number of participants (which we assumed would grow linearly)
<br>
the speedup of processors (Moore's law with a 2 yr doubling time),
<br>
the continued steady improvement of the algorithm, plus several other
<br>
assumptions which have proved fairly accurate with two notable exceptions:
<br>
<p>a) I failed to foresee the People's Republic of Taxifornia's power crisis
<br>
<p>b) I did not account for the fact that George Woltman, the founder of
<br>
GIMPS {may he live forever and fill the earth with his descendants}
<br>
would continue to *optimize* the Prime95 fourier transforms for
<br>
*specific processors*.  George is pending his time doing this for nothing
<br>
instead of taking that skill and making about a jillion dollars with it,
<br>
which proves Eliezer's point that there are a few people in this big
<br>
world who do things like this.
