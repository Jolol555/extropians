<p><em>&gt; What about attaching an ion engine and taking some time with the moving?

<p>An ion engine would be the logical way to do this, however
<br>
it would still require buttloads of propellant.  Consider the
<br>
advantage of launching from the equator: its around 300
<br>
meters per second over a 51 degree orbit.  The rule of
<br>
thumb for orbit inclination changes for a LEO is about
<br>
8000*(# degrees change)/90, so I get 4600ish m/sec.
<br>
It would take a long time to make your money back
<br>
at that rate.
<br>
<p>There is one other factor that wasnt said: if in a high
<br>
inclination orbit, more people with money see the thing
<br>
pass overhead, perhaps firing imaginations and encouraging
<br>
politicians to vote more funds into the thing.  Lets face it,
<br>
the Apollo program was an enormous government boondoggle,
<br>
yet it did fire a lotta imaginations, and helped advance
<br>
extropian notions.  The awesomeness of it all!  The sheer
<br>
audacity!  The wicked coolness!  |8-]   spike
