</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, I do think that, at its heart, Western science's quest for &quot;one true
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion with its &quot;one true god.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Ben, don't assume that because there's a single word, &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot;,
<br>
that Judaism and Christianity have the same basic pattern.  They're more
<br>
alike than, say, Islam and Buddhism, but they aren't the same.
<br>
<p>One of the strongest driving causes behind my original break with Judaism
<br>
was when my teachers and parents tried to explain to me that two ancient
<br>
rabbis making contradictory statements could be &quot;both right&quot; and that
<br>
&quot;you'll understand when you're older&quot;.  The original cause of my break
<br>
with orthodoxy was at age five, when they tried to explain that you didn't
<br>
have to understand the words in order to pray.  Even at that age - before
<br>
I had even begun to formulate abstract concepts about relative
<br>
trustworthiness - I was basically sure that I was right and they were
<br>
wrong.  But people trying to explain to me that two contradictory
<br>
statements could be &quot;both right&quot; was when I started to totally distrust
<br>
the *system*.
<br>
<p>One of the reasons why I have confidence - too much confidence, you would
<br>
undoubtedly say - is that from the very beginning of my life I have
<br>
refused to compromise with blatant nonsense and I have so far always
<br>
turned out to be right, even as a five-year-old opposing my parents, my
<br>
teachers, an entire community of adults and a thousand-year-old
<br>
tradition.  Maybe you would chalk that down as another problem caused by
<br>
religion - getting away with breaking with it makes you overconfident -
<br>
except that, as I understand the pattern, people usually accept what
<br>
they're told when they're young and reject it only in the course of
<br>
growing up, with great stress.  I simply never accepted the really dumb
<br>
ideas to begin with, and I'm proud of that.  So maybe it's not just a
<br>
fortunate coincidence.  To phrase it in Hansonian Bayes-speak, maybe a
<br>
refusal to compromise in the face of social pressure is a powerful enough
<br>
factor that it licenses one five-year-old reasoner to maintain his own
<br>
opinion in the face of the disagreement of his entire social universe -
<br>
because the independent intelligence of one five-year-old Eliezer is
<br>
closer to rationality than the forces that underlie memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the universe is not actually structured such that there is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compact pattern that explains everything, either in the domain of spiritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience or in the domain of physical law.  Perhaps there are multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overlapping patterns....  This is how it seems right now in the physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain -- quantum theory and general relativity being examples of deep,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overlapping, difficult-to-unify patterns -- but we, our archetypal view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being the Judeochristian &quot;one true law&quot; approach, persist in believing there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MUST be an elegant underlying unifying equation....  Perhaps the one who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creates the next great physics theory will be an AI who lacks this bias!!
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there must be an elegant underlying unifying equation.  I
<br>
think there's very probably an underlying equation or underlying cellular
<br>
automaton or underlying something, but our civilization is too young to
<br>
make pronouncements about that.  Cultural relativism, though, exists for
<br>
memetic reasons, not because someone examined the ultimate underlying laws
<br>
of physics.  The idea that there could be &quot;more than one truth&quot; is a
<br>
social and memetic event, used to avoid unpleasant disagreements, not a
<br>
theory of physics.
<br>
<p>The reason why physics searches for one unifying equation is simple:  The
<br>
last generation of physicists got away with it.  Maybe it won't work for
<br>
the next step beyond relativity and quantum mechanics; maybe we've reached
<br>
the point where the Universe has complex structure rather than simple
<br>
structure.  I, for one, think that string theory is but sheer bogosity.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, aren't you the person who insists that intelligence has an
<br>
equation, and aren't I the person who insists that the
<br>
hundred-trillion-synapse problem is as mathematically intractable as the
<br>
three-body problem?
<br>
<p>As a general rule, I'd be careful in stating that the search for truth is
<br>
a religious concept.  Religious concepts exist for reasons.  The drive to
<br>
discover truth is innate and hardwired.  Religions insist that they are
<br>
objective truth in order to take advantage of our evolved drive to believe
<br>
objectively true things.  Cultural relativists who argue over whether
<br>
tigers are &quot;really&quot; dangerous get eaten.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For instance, it seems extreme to me to claim that music from all different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures can be &quot;compared&quot; in some way, so that the best Chinese opera can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be judged objectively against the best Western opera. Yet, within a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, comparison is much easier -- there's something close to a consensus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about which Western operas are great and which are not, and which Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operas are great and which are not.  Traditionally, adherents of absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truthism claimed that Western  music was intrinsically superior to all other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms of music, which were somehow primitive and intrinsically inharmonious.
</em><br>
<p>Here, again, we see the standard argument for cultural relativism:  &quot;A
<br>
said that [totally arbitrary cultural construct 1] was objectively true,
<br>
but B said that [totally arbitrary cultural construct 2] was objectively
<br>
true, and there's no way to decide between them; therefore, there must be
<br>
no such thing as objective truth.&quot;  A truthist would simply say that A and
<br>
B are both wrong and that they both mistakenly believe their personal
<br>
preferences to be objective truth.  It doesn't mean that objective truth
<br>
is nonexistent, just that humans are evolved to sometimes try and state
<br>
that something subjective is really objective, in order to give it greater
<br>
memetic potential.  What possible bearing could that have on whether
<br>
underlying reality is subjective or objective?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm looking forward to your absolute and incontrovertible definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.
</em><br>
<p>Suppose I didn't have one.  Would that prove there was no truth?  Anyway,
<br>
there's a rough definition of the Consensus in:
<br>
<p><a href="http://singinst.org/CaTAI/mind/consensus.html">http://singinst.org/CaTAI/mind/consensus.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Science isn't somebody's opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's no individual's opinion, but it may be a mass nonlinear superposition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of many peoples' opinions.
</em><br>
<p>Describe it as a mass nonlinear superposition of many peoples'
<br>
*convergent* opinions, where the thing converged *to* is actual reality,
<br>
and you've just reinvented the idea of the Consensus.  All our ideas are
<br>
ultimately subjective, in the sense that they exist in our brains rather
<br>
than underlying reality.  But there is *still* an underlying reality, and
<br>
in some cases the ideas are very tightly bound.  You cannot &quot;say whatever
<br>
you want&quot; and be &quot;just as right, ultimately&quot; because that violates the
<br>
binding - the sensory, predictive, and manipulative binding that is the
<br>
reason why intelligence exists in the first place.  The Consensus is
<br>
nearly as unforgiving as physical reality; it is not 100% right, but it is
<br>
99.99% right, and the instant you cross the line you get eaten by one of
<br>
those subjectively &quot;dangerous&quot; tigers.
<br>
<p>This precise, unforgiving binding is what we call &quot;truth&quot;.  The stuff
<br>
truths are bound to is what we call &quot;reality&quot;.  Within the Consensus, a
<br>
&quot;subjective&quot; issue is one that is roughly arbitrary in the sense of being
<br>
determined primarily by initial values, with little or no convergence; an
<br>
issue that is determined primarily by reference to the initial settings of
<br>
internal cognitive values.  An &quot;objective&quot; issue is one settled primarily
<br>
by reference to external reality and therefore convergent.  Cultural
<br>
relativism consists of arguing that since some subjective issues were
<br>
claimed to be objective, nothing is objective and everything is true.  A
<br>
truthist would simply say that the claimants were WRONG.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Ben, take a stand on something.  You'll feel better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eli, take a few hits of blotter acid...
</em><br>
<p>Hah!  Now it is *you* who fail to notice my subtle ironies!
