<p>Well, I'll say it flatly: God does not exist. 
<br>
<p>Would you say that Santa Claus exists? Or would you be discreetly 
<br>
non-commital?  After all, can you prove that Santa Claus does not 
<br>
exist?
<br>
<p>While agnostics are people who don't have a strong claim in the
<br>
matter, most are really atheists under the Santa Claus test. 
<br>
They are merely unwilling to say so for some reason.  They no more 
<br>
believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy than they believe in God, 
<br>
but are merely &quot;agnostic&quot; about the latter (for some arcane reason). 
<br>
Yet they do not hesitate to express their strong belief that the
<br>
former do not exist.
<br>
<p>The truth is, we can't prove anything.  An educated 21st century 
<br>
person with good judgment has to stand by the statements that 
<br>
the Earth goes round the sun and God does not exist.
