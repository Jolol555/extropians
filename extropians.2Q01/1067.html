<p><em>&gt;When those are all done, the stage will be set for the 2nd tier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organisms -- those that I listed at Extro 4 as useful because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have already invented novel solutions to the problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that need to be solved for slowly aging or non-aging organisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If I and some others have any say in motivating the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the various genome centers these will be the next set
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of organisms to be sequenced.
</em><br>
<p>A great initial target will be elephants.  Many selling points:
<br>
<p>a) Long-lived and large; good for aging and cancer research
<br>
b) Distant from humans; they're on a different superorder
<br>
(Afrotheria) from rodents and humans (Glires).  Unlike whales,
<br>
(related to hippos, cows, etc.)there are few other reasonable 
<br>
sequencing candidates from that superorder.
<br>
c) Engangered charismatic megafauna (probably the most effective
<br>
point from the funding point)
<br>
d) Sequencing would be relevant for proposed mammoth 
<br>
resurrections.
<br>
<p>You can sell it to the conservationists on c), to techies on d),
<br>
to most geneticists on b), and you still get a).  Granted, they're
<br>
not quite as promising as whales, but they're still a great one
<br>
to check.  Although they don't live much longer than us, they
<br>
are larger, so are likely to have better cancer defenses.  
<br>
Since they're so distanct phylogenetically, even their
<br>
longevity solutions probably differ from ours as the last 
<br>
common ancestor was a Cretaceous insect-eating shrew.
