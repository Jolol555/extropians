Eliezer:
<br>
<em>&gt; I think the only correct statement we can make at this point is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't know whether it would be possible to do human- or superhuman-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level AI using an architecture like the Internet.  Perhaps current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches to AI don't parallelize very well, but of course they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come anywhere near to human level AI either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James is right that it seems that only a small fraction of problems can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit the kind of parallelism found on the net, but Eliezer is right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we don't know whether it would be possible to design a cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture which could run efficiently there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>While I can't claim an omniscient knowledge of all possible AI
<br>
architectures, I've explored this conceptual space well enough that I can
<br>
state with a very high degree of certainty that, indeed,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- there are some aspects of a digital mind's function that exploit the
<br>
Net's massively parallel architecture very well
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- there are others that just plain don't
<br>
<p>Specifically, real-time conversation processing or real-time
<br>
perception/action or data analysis of any kind does NOT exploit this
<br>
architecture well.  For this, you really want a supercomputer, or a highly
<br>
powerful cluster of fast computers.  There are also aspects of &quot;logical
<br>
thinking&quot; that seem to have about the same requirements (they require rapid
<br>
SEQUENTIAL processing of a certain kind, rather than distributed
<br>
processing) -- I think Dennett had it about right here in his &quot;Consciousness
<br>
Explained&quot; book .. he didn't explain consciousness very well, but he did
<br>
very nicely explain the serial nature of some linguistic/logical processes
<br>
(and talk a lot about the seriality of these processes as compared to the
<br>
brain's underlying parallel hardware).
<br>
<p>On the other hand there's a hell of a lot of processing that benefits *very,
<br>
very well* from Internet-style massive distribution.  We need to distinguish
<br>
two cases here
<br>
<p>1) Internet nodes that have a high-bandwidth constant connection to be
<br>
utilized during problem-solving
<br>
<p>These can be used for a lot of things.  One example is procedure learning
<br>
(&quot;schema learning&quot; as we call it in Webmind), which can be done by using the
<br>
remote nodes to 'breed' populations of procedures, with the fitness
<br>
evaluation of each population element relying on calls back to a central
<br>
server containing a database of information and executing an inference
<br>
function.
<br>
<p>2) truly remote nodes, accessible via very low-bandwith or
<br>
frequently-inactive connections (e.g. modems)
<br>
<p>These can be used for fewer things.
<br>
One example of what they can be used for is parameter optimization.  Log
<br>
files from a complex system can be data mined by various distributed
<br>
schemes, resulting in new results about optimal parameter settings in
<br>
various contexts.
<br>
<p><p>We've worked through various cases like this in a lot of detail... and
<br>
designed a framework called Webworld, a sister to Webmind, that was intended
<br>
to exploit the massively distributed power of the Internet to support WM in
<br>
various ways.  This was crudely prototyped but never really developed.
