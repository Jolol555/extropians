<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Menopause may be &quot;curable&quot;
<br>
<p>Menopause, the cessation of menstruation known as &quot;the change of life&quot;,
<br>
while looked forward to by some women who have difficult menstrual
<br>
periods, is dreaded by many who fear hot flashes, depression, insomnia,
<br>
loss of libido and other unwelcome changes. Menopause is believed to start
<br>
in the ovaries, with a loss of eggs and their accompanying estrogen. But
<br>
researchers at the University of Michigan, funded by the National
<br>
Institute of Health's Institute on Aging, are testing the theory that
<br>
rather than starting in the ovaries, menopause starts in the brain with a
<br>
disruption of circadian rhythms. Although the trial, currently in its
<br>
fourth year, is not over, preliminary findings look promising.
<br>
<p>Research team leader and University of Michigan School of Nursing
<br>
Professor, Nancy Reame, MSN, PhD, explained, &quot;If we can understand the
<br>
causes of the very early, initial changes that may be happening in the
<br>
brain to bring on menopause, we will probably then have a way of
<br>
intervening much earlier than at the time of menopause . . . Obviously,
<br>
you can't go in and look at women's brains to see the changes to the
<br>
hypothalamus, which is the part of the brain that regulates the menstrual
<br>
cycle and ovulation. Instead, we at U-M are studying a particular brain
<br>
function that we know plays an important role in the menstrual cycle
<br>
regulation, and that is the production of the hormone GnRH.&quot;
<br>
<p>GnRH stands for gonadotropin releasing hormone, a hormone released by the
<br>
brain whose levels change throughout the life of women as well as over a
<br>
twenty-four hour period, particularly during sleep. GnRH interacts with
<br>
the pituitary gland to secrete hormones in a rhythm that signals the ovary
<br>
to stimulate growth of a new egg every month. Study participants at the
<br>
University of Michigan General Clinical Research Center's sleep lab have
<br>
their GnRH levels monitored during sleep to study the changes in the
<br>
rhythm that occur as women age.
<br>
<p>Dr Reame added, &quot;Because GnRH is the conductor of the reproductive cycle,
<br>
any changes in the brain that start early on could conceivably be the
<br>
preemptive cause for this change in ovarian function and perhaps, may be
<br>
part of early changes associated with menstrual cycle irregularity . . .
<br>
Besides estrogen, there are a number of other hormones produced by the
<br>
ovaries that we think play an important role in fine tuning menstrual
<br>
cycle regularity and maintaining fertility. We now know that these
<br>
fine-tuning hormones are also lost over time, well before estrogen levels
<br>
drop.&quot;
<br>
<p>A way to delay or prevent menopause would be a boon for women who are
<br>
attempting to conceive later in life, as well as help to decrease the risk
<br>
of osteoporosis and heart disease. It would also relieve women of the
<br>
physical and mental symptoms that many experience during this time. The
<br>
downside could be an enhanced risk of breast cancer.
<br>
<p>Dr Reame announced, &quot;We may have a cure for menopause, if we really want
<br>
to do that.&quot;
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Female hormone modulation therapy
<br>
<p>Concern about the life-threatening side effects of synthetic hormone drugs
<br>
has caused many women to be deprived of the benefits of safe natural
<br>
hormone replacement therapy.
<br>
<p>Proper hormone modulation can prevent degenerative disease and improve
<br>
functioning in both the physical and emotional spheres of life, both at
<br>
menopause and throughout life. For example, many sexual &quot;dysfunctions,&quot;
<br>
including lack of desire, can be mitigated when hormone levels are
<br>
naturally restored to a youthful profile. Menopause might also be delayed
<br>
and be less traumatic if hormone adjustments are made in time. Numerous
<br>
female health problems are tied to inadequate hormone balances, as we will
<br>
show.
<br>
<p>Forty-five million women are menopausal in the United States today;
<br>
another 3.5 million women will become menopausal this year. Based on life
<br>
expectancy trends, women face the prospect of spending the last one-third
<br>
to one-half of their lives in a state of hormonal imbalance. The quality
<br>
and quantity of life for these women will be determined by how well they
<br>
(and their doctors) manage their hormone replacement.
<br>
<p>Evidence suggests that estriol offers many of the benefits of more
<br>
traditional estrogen replacement therapies, but without the harsh side
<br>
effects or longer term dangers often encountered by other substances and
<br>
trademarked products. First, some background. The primary forms of
<br>
estrogen include three substances: estrone, estradiol and estriol. Estrone
<br>
sulphate is the form of estrogen found in Premarin, while 17-a estradiol
<br>
is the form of estrogen found in the products Estrace and Estraderm.
<br>
Estrone and estradiol, known as &quot;conjugated estrogens,&quot; significantly
<br>
increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer when taken for more than 10
<br>
years. According to the Merck Manual, conjugated estrogens are substances
<br>
that even have been listed as known carcinogens, yet they are the
<br>
unquestioned choices of too many physicians.
<br>
<p>Estriol, on the other hand, is a weak estrogen that provides the antiaging
<br>
benefits of estrogen replacement therapy, apparently without the risk of
<br>
cancer. Consider this evidence of its benignity: during pregnancy, huge
<br>
amounts of estriol are secreted by the placenta to protect the fetus.
<br>
Urinary assay of estriol is used to assess the fetus' viability.
<br>
<p>There also is direct evidence from animal studies, and indirect evidence
<br>
from human studies, that estriol can prevent breast cancer. Much of this
<br>
work has been done by Dr. H. M. Lemon and associates of the Department of
<br>
Internal Medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.
<br>
In one study, they induced mammary tumors by radiation in female rats. In
<br>
the control group, 75% developed tumors.  However, among those animals
<br>
receiving estriol, just 48% developed tumors. In another study by the
<br>
Lemon team, estriol was shown to have &quot;the most significant anti-mammary
<br>
carcinogenic activity of 22 tested compounds [because]. . . estriol is
<br>
less likely to induce proliferative changes in the target organs of
<br>
cancer-prone women than estrone or estradiol.&quot;

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Pregnenolone
<br>
<p>Pregnenolone is the true &quot;mother hormone,&quot; made directly from cholesterol
<br>
within the mitochondria. In addition to memory enhancement, a partial list
<br>
of pregnenolone's diverse benefits include:
<br>
<p>1.  No negative feedback loop. Once produced, pregnenolone leaves  the
<br>
mitochondria so it cannot inhibit its own synthesis.
<br>
2.  Complete hormone balance. Does everything DHEA does and more. Unlike
<br>
DHEA, pregnenolone readily converts into progesterone.
<br>
3.  Enzyme repair. The cytochrome P-450 enzyme system is stimulated by the
<br>
addition of pregnenolone. This enzyme system is important in neutralizing
<br>
cellular toxins.
<br>
4. Protection from cortisol/cortisone. Cortisol levels increase with
<br>
normal aging causing immune impairment, atherosclerosis, and neuronal
<br>
injury. Pregnenolone protects against adrenal atrophy when withdrawing
<br>
cortisone therapy. Pregnenolone helps protect against the effects of
<br>
elevated cortisol including atrophy of the skin, osteoporosis, hot flashes
<br>
in women and possibly adult-onset diabetes.

<br>
<p>MegaSoy
<br>
<p>MEGA SOY EXTRACT provides more than twice the amount of dietary soy
<br>
isoflavones typically consumed in Japan, where breast and prostate cancer
<br>
are very low.
<br>
<p>Menopausal symptoms and the incidence of osteoporosis also are reduced
<br>
among those who consume soy. And one study shows that soy isoflavones
<br>
promote an anabolic effect on bone density in post-menopausal women by
<br>
binding to the estrogen receptors in bone tissue.
<br>
<p>For general disease prevention purposes, one capsule, twice a day is
<br>
suggested. Women seeking to use higher doses of the new soy extract for
<br>
the phytoestrogenic effects should take two to three capsules, twice a
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>Soy extracts have become very popular in the last few years as an adjuvant
<br>
(assisting) cancer therapy. In fact the scientific literature makes a
<br>
strong case that all cancer patients should take soy supplements. Treating
<br>
cancer, however, is not simple, and some cancer patients are less likely
<br>
to benefit from soy, while others should not use it at all.

HealthWatch:  The rationale for annual blood testing
<br>
<p>Aging causes significant alterations in hormone balance.
<br>
<p>In aging men, beneficial hormones such as testosterone, DHEA and growth
<br>
hormone decline, while less desirable hormones such as estrogen and
<br>
cortisol often increase. The effects of these hormone imbalances can
<br>
manifest as clinical depression, increased abdominal obesity, diminished
<br>
mental and physical energy levels, and loss of libido.
<br>
<p>Aging females often suffer a progesterone and DHEA deficit, while levels
<br>
of estrogen and testosterone can become too high or low. The clinical
<br>
effects of these hormone imbalances in females often manifest as the
<br>
symptoms associated with menopause, depression, loss of bone mass, and
<br>
loss of libido.
<br>
<p>In both men and women, the failure to correct hormone imbalance can
<br>
directly contribute to cardiovascular disease, certain forms of cancer,
<br>
Type II diabetes, osteoporosis, and neuronal degeneration.
<br>
<p>The good news is that once hormone status is ascertained, definitive
<br>
corrective action can be taken to safely restore hormone balance to a
<br>
youthful range.
