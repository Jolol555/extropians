<p>[re bolide theory of end-Cretaceous extinction]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I admit, I have some problems with it.  What!?!  The usual way the scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is put, it's hard to believe anything above bugs and bacteria would 
</em><br>
survive.
<br>
<em>&gt;  There has to be a reason why crocodiles, mammals, lizards, toads, and birds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  made it, but T. rex didn't.  A big asteroid hit would seem to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  egalitarian in its affects, taking out all major groups -- not specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  targeting nonavian dinosaurs
</em><br>
<p>The above groups all differ from dinos in that they 
<br>
can take refuge underground or underwater*.  If the 
<br>
earth was put on &quot;bake&quot; for 1 day, as one estimate of 
<br>
tecktite heat delivery has it, the dinos would indeed 
<br>
be all gone and the above groups still there.  
<br>
<p>* it wasn't all birds.  Actually birds were almost
<br>
entirely wiped out.  Only one group of shore birds 
<br>
survived.  They then radiated to current bird niches.
<br>
The near-elimination of birds *may* have provided the
<br>
opportunity for bats to emerge.
<br>
<p>I just heard yesterday of a discovery of a suspicious
<br>
carbon layer at the Triassic/Jurassic mass extinction
<br>
boundary.  An interesting point is that the end-
<br>
Cretaceous and end-Permian extinction match up with
<br>
*both* massive bolide impacts *and* bogglingly large
<br>
flood basalts.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Archibald points out the myriads effects of sea level changes and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this correlates well with the fossil evidence -- much better than an impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or massive volcanism.
</em><br>
<p>I don't get that.  Sea level changes happen all the time.  I just saw
<br>
a palentologist talk about the 300-meter drop at the end of the Miocene
<br>
oscillation.  The graph of late Tertiary sea levels looks like the path
<br>
traced by a yoyo as its operator walks on uneven ground.
