<em>&gt; And for an analysis that claims that any tightly-designed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do-it-right approach to networked hypertext was doomed to failure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that all the things that are bad about the Web as we know and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love it (such as unidirectional links) were actually **necessary**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to its success, see:

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html">http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>This is a good article, and the other thing to keep in mind is that at the
<br>
time of its creation, the Web was just another hypertext system.  It was
<br>
not the first implementation of hypertext, nor the best.  It existed in
<br>
a competitive environment where there were many hypertext systems for
<br>
sale and in use.  Most of these however were closed, commercial systems
<br>
which worked better at small scales.
<br>
<p>The web grew slowly at first, as well.  We tend to forget how slow
<br>
exponential growth is.  Doubling every year is amazing when you go
<br>
from 500 million users to 1 billion.  It's not so impressive when you
<br>
go from 50 users to 100 after a whole year.  Berners-Lee for a long
<br>
time kept a pointer to every single web page in the world at his site.
<br>
It was several years before he had to give that up.
<br>
<p>Now Berners-Lee is pushing XML as a replacement for HTML (that is,
<br>
XHTML as the XML version of HTML).  Along with this will come other XML
<br>
based extensions which will provide for at least the mechanism to have
<br>
bidirectional links, labeled links, and some of the other features which
<br>
critics have called for.  It remains to be seen whether these extensions
<br>
will catch on.
<br>
<p>Ultimately it's a matter of what the market wants.  The web suited
<br>
people's requirements better than the more ambitious systems, because
<br>
it was easy to implement and use.
