</em><br>
<p>I guess this is what the Friendly AI and ethics discussions are for. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You make the mistake to apply our way of thinking (highly empirical,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You must be joking.  Saying that any human based creature is fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational in all respects is highly dubious.  Implying that all relgious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are fanatics and/or so different from you and yours is also
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hmm, how exactly do you interpret my sentence to mean what you oppose
<br>
above? What was saying is that we take a rational approach to things -
<br>
if B is a logical consequence of A, and we get convinced about A, then
<br>
we better accept B (and so on), not that we are perfectly rational
<br>
beings. And this sub-thread is actually about religious fanatics, not
<br>
the pleasant everyday people. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plenty of them will fall to the lure of the SI, but given what we know of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human nature the SI would likely have to resort to direct brain surgery to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convince some of them. Which is of course the problem: exactly how far do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allow a &quot;friendly&quot; entity to go in its quest to help us? I would definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not support such an entity if it ignored the right to one's life, body,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thoughts and property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, if we start talking about direct brain surgery to change the minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sentient beings then we are straying into &quot;anti-Christ&quot; territory. 
</em><br>
<p>My view too. This is where ethics becomes relevant. Even when people
<br>
disagree about particulars or even the foundations of ethics, it is
<br>
possible to get a broad consensus about humans having a right to their
<br>
lives, bodies, thoughts and property (although the last is often
<br>
ignored, despite being a corrolary of the first ones) as a kind of
<br>
simple default that can then be narrowed down by more complex ethical
<br>
systems by adding more do's and dont's. I see it as a good first step
<br>
towards a more sane society to get the mainstream to accept this
<br>
position as a kind of inter-group ethics and leave the rest to the
<br>
groups.
