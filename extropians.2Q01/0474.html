SEATTLE MAYOR DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY
<br>
&quot;We will not stand for this 'earthquake' nonsense,&quot; says Schell
<br>
<p>February 28, 2001
<br>
<p>Mayor Paul Schell announced today that the city would take a
<br>
zero-tolerance stance against earthquakes after one of the mysterious
<br>
natural disasters struck Seattle.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have declared a 'no-earthquake zone' in a fifty-block radius,&quot; Schell
<br>
said. &quot;I have told the police department to use their pepper spray and
<br>
rubber bullets against any earthquake that dares to show its face in
<br>
Seattle.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Seattle has a history of tolerance for weather,&quot; Schell continued with
<br>
a note of pride in his voice. &quot;We have rain, we have storms, we even
<br>
tolerate lightning. But we will not sit back and allow these hooligan
<br>
earthquakes to destroy our city.&quot;
<br>
<p>Several police units could be seen patrolling the quake-shaken areas in
<br>
downtown Seattle this evening.
<br>
<p>&quot;If I see one of them quakes ... well, no mercy, you know? No mercy,&quot;
<br>
one police officer stated bluntly. His badge number was covered by black
<br>
tape and his nametag had been removed. Many Seattle police officers
<br>
expressed interest in catching the leader of the earthquake movement.
<br>
<p>The earthquakes in Seattle have provoked a nationwide dialogue about the
<br>
best ways to effectively resist such acts of terror.
<br>
<p>&quot;These earthquakes -- or 'quakes,' as they are called -- are very
<br>
secretive organizations,&quot; Dr. Henry Blagger said at a press conference.
<br>
&quot;They originate deep underground and they strike without any warning
<br>
whatsoever.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I think they all oughta be arrested and thrown in jail forever,&quot; said
<br>
Gerald Hainer, 43, a layman who knows nothing about tectonic plate
<br>
movement. &quot;I'm tired of earthquakes and all of these other radical
<br>
natural phenomena coming in here and just doing as they please. I have a
<br>
job, you know.&quot;
<br>
<p>There has been no word from the earthquakes for their motives in
<br>
striking Seattle.
