<br>
<p>America's Century of Progress
<br>
<p>Life is better than ever for Americans. So why are they so gloomy?
<br>
<p>It's Getting Better All the Time is designed to raise a reader's 
<br>
spirits--and it does. But reading carefully between the lines may raise some 
<br>
unsettling questions, too.
<br>
<p>In his final book, the late economist Julian Simon sets out to show how 
<br>
dramatically the U.S. standard of living improved during the twentieth 
<br>
century--particularly in the last 50 years. Simon was long an articulate and 
<br>
impassioned optimist regarding prospects for the future; the book was 
<br>
completed by Stephen Moore, his young protegé at the Cato Institute, a 
<br>
well-known libertarian think tank.
<br>
<p>Assembling statistics from 21 areas, Moore and Simon have little difficulty 
<br>
demonstrating that people who lived in the United States in 1900--or even in 
<br>
1950--were significantly less healthy, less wealthy, and had fewer 
<br>
opportunities to realize their private dreams than Americans today. A few 
<br>
examples and quotations are enough to make this point:
<br>
<p>Better health. In 1900 the average American citizen could expect to live 
<br>
just under 50 years; today that figure stands at 77 years and is still 
<br>
rising steadily.
<br>
Better food. Food today is more plentiful, more nutritious, more appetizing, 
<br>
more varied, and relatively cheaper than in 1900. &quot;The cost of purchasing 
<br>
food in terms of time worked has fallen about fivefold over the twentieth 
<br>
century.&quot;
<br>
Amazing affluence. &quot;More financial wealth has been generated in the United 
<br>
States over the past 50 years than was created in all the rest of the world 
<br>
in all the centuries before 1950.&quot; And while a few phenomenally wealthy 
<br>
individuals may grab the headlines, the very definition of &quot;rich&quot; in America 
<br>
has been revolutionized. There are now some 8 million millionaires in the 
<br>
United States (up from 5,000 in 1900); the median family income in America 
<br>
has nearly doubled since 1950; and those Americans who own stock now 
<br>
outnumber trade union members three to one.
<br>
More comfort, less hardship. While agreeing that too many Americans (some 30 
<br>
million) still come within the government's official definition of &quot;poor,&quot; 
<br>
Moore and Simon point out that in America today the poor make up a far 
<br>
smaller percentage of the total population than ever before. In 1950, 30% of 
<br>
U.S. citizens were classified as poor (75% of blacks). Today those figures 
<br>
have dropped to 15% overall, and only 25%-30% of blacks.
<br>
Moore and Simon also point out that being poor in America today doesn't 
<br>
involve as much hardship as it once did. If a family's standard of living 
<br>
(i.e., what they can afford to buy) is considered rather than cash income 
<br>
alone, the number of Americans living in poverty is really less than the 
<br>
government's count. Citing research by University of Texas economist Daniel 
<br>
Slesnick, the authors note that most poor Americans today &quot;have a living 
<br>
standard . . . higher than that of the middle class 50 years ago, and higher 
<br>
than that of all but the richest Americans at the start of the [twentieth] 
<br>
century.&quot;
<br>
<p>Almost 40% of &quot;poor&quot; families in America today own their own homes; 70% own 
<br>
a car or truck, 95% own at least one television, and 99% have a 
<br>
refrigerator, indoor plumbing, and electricity.
<br>
<p>The authors also note that, in 1998, the U.S. government drew the &quot;poverty&quot; 
<br>
line at an income of $8,480 per year or less. Yet in that year this amount 
<br>
was higher than the average per capita income in 155 countries--and nearly 
<br>
double the global average income of $4,890.
<br>
<p>Other &quot;good news&quot; from Moore and Simon include statistics that show 
<br>
improvements for American children and teens (drug-use and smoking down, 
<br>
childhood diseases dramatically reduced, fewer teenage pregnancies); for 
<br>
minorities (more legal protection and social justice, gains in education, 
<br>
income, and health); for women (less household drudgery, more women in 
<br>
college, and, recently, many more women in top business and professional 
<br>
jobs); and for workers (the number of holidays and vacation days has more 
<br>
than doubled, while Americans today retire on average five years earlier (at 
<br>
age 60) and enter the workforce two years later than they did at 
<br>
mid-century.
<br>
<p>If life in America is so good, why do many Americans still feel dissatisfied 
<br>
and yearn for &quot;the good old days?&quot; Moore and Simon believe the fault lies 
<br>
with the media.
<br>
<p>They explain the persistence of pessimism among Americans as a case of 
<br>
constantly obsessing over problems while ignoring progress. This happens 
<br>
because good news is underreported and bad news exaggerated because fear 
<br>
sells. Quoting Michael Prowse, a writer for the Financial Times of London, 
<br>
the authors agree that &quot;The United States has a much worse reputation than 
<br>
it deserves. Commercial television and cinema represent a grotesquely 
<br>
distorted image of modern American life. The tendency of foreigners to bash 
<br>
the U.S. is encouraged by the very openness of the society. . . . Other 
<br>
countries try to hide their sins in the interest of progress. Americans take 
<br>
delight in exposing theirs.&quot;
<br>
<p>Certainly the statistics that Moore and Simon present in this 
<br>
book--reinforced with impressive full-color, full-page graphs--make a 
<br>
convincing case for how much more Americans of today possess and enjoy than 
<br>
their ancestors did a century--or even half a century--ago.
<br>
<p>But nowhere do the authors take account of the psychological forces in 
<br>
American life. Without denying the accuracy of their data, a thoughtful 
<br>
reader may well question whether Moore and Simon draw the only possible 
<br>
conclusions from the facts they present.
<br>
<p>For example, they state that the pay for most occupations today is better 
<br>
than ever; and specifically assert that &quot;teachers, service workers, steel 
<br>
workers, secretaries, and factory workers, just to name a few, fare 
<br>
substantially better financially than their counterparts did 40 years ago.&quot; 
<br>
Financially better, perhaps. But consider what these particular occupations 
<br>
have lost in those same 40 years.
<br>
<p>American factory and steelworkers today, though highly paid and still the 
<br>
envy of the world for their unmatched skill and productivity, can no longer 
<br>
feel secure in their jobs. The globalization of markets and manufacturing 
<br>
facilities has made every industry subject to fluctuations in demand and 
<br>
cost pressures that bear no relation to performance on the job. How can you 
<br>
feel secure when you know you may be downsized out of your job with little 
<br>
warning due to fast-changing economic conditions?
<br>
<p>American life is better today, if what we mean by better is &quot;more physically 
<br>
comfortable,&quot; &quot;less monotonous,&quot; &quot;more entertaining.&quot; But someone needs to 
<br>
ask how we can restore--or at least compensate for having to live 
<br>
without--the sense of community, respect, stability, and pride of place that 
<br>
make the American Dream something more than just a grab for dollars.
<br>
<p>That said, It's Getting Better All the Time should be taken seriously. To 
<br>
ignore America's genuine progress over the past 100 years does a disservice 
<br>
to the men and women whose effort made that progress possible. Taking our 
<br>
present affluence for granted also blinds us to the intensely held 
<br>
aspirations of less-developed nations. If Americans find problems with the 
<br>
material paradise they inhabit, they still must acknowledge that the 
<br>
paradise exists and recognize that attempts to simply dismantle it (instead 
<br>
of working to sustain and extend its genuine benefits to people who still 
<br>
lack them) will neither satisfy this nation's critics nor make their own 
<br>
lives easier.
<br>
<p>Even relatively well-to-do citizens in Europe, Asia, and Latin America 
<br>
routinely endure periodic shortages of food and consumer goods, unreliable 
<br>
public services, and currency fluctuations unknown in the United States. 
<br>
Facing the facts of prosperity, as Moore and Simon present them, makes it 
<br>
easier to understand why so many people in so many nations would rather be 
<br>
&quot;poor&quot; in America than remain where they are with little hope of much 
<br>
near-term improvement.
