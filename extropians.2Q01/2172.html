<em>&gt; Brian
</em><br>
<p>Since God supposedly created the universe, perhaps we don't know enough about
<br>
God to say with certainty that there is a universe.
<br>
If you can think for yourself, it doesn't make any difference at all whether
<br>
you include theology or exclude it from your world view, because no one can
<br>
agree on a universal theistic definition. One person's god is another's joke,
<br>
and vice versa. Not with certainty, but with difficulty we refer to
<br>
non-trivial facts about billions of people rushing to their doom, oblivious of
<br>
the impending evolutionary phase transition. No matter how much you know about
<br>
the universe, you won't be able to say with certainty that there is not a god
<br>
urging and encouraging your agnosticism, because theism has more to do with
<br>
obstinacy than with the quest for knowledge.
<br>
<p>ô¿ô
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
