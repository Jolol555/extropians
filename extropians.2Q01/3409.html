<p>(I know I'm posting too much this weekend, but I have to get this off my mind.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unless and until people on this list value people who contribute to society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and stop labeling them for a shock factor, we cannot progress beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stigmas of gender and ethnicity.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you, and I see a larger perspective.
<br>
<p>Here is one of the few places where the philosophy shared by
<br>
many here is: to NOT to be limited by boxes, conventions, and narrow
<br>
mind-sets,
<br>
and, in the ideas we share, people are encouraged to be BETTER (in
<br>
whatever way *you* define better: smarter, stronger, healthier etc.).
<br>
Here in this small community, folks are NOT reduced to the lowest common
<br>
denominator and instead, the &quot;sky's the limit&quot; (as they say).
<br>
This is THE main reason that I hang out here, and why I keep coming back.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I'm surprised to find some attitudes lamenting the sorry
<br>
state that &quot;unboxed people&quot; are few and far between, when, in fact,
<br>
I see HUGE numbers of unboxed and amazing people doing amazing things.
<br>
These amazing people inspire ME.
<br>
<p>Could it be that my filters are set to let through the amazing
<br>
accomplishments of those people around me, and these other people's
<br>
filters are adjusted radically differently?
<br>
<p>I strongly encourage people to pay attention to their own mindsets.
<br>
If you *think* that people can only do limited things, then I'm quite
<br>
sure that those limitations will be ONLY what you see, and you will find
<br>
yourself in dreamy wistfulness &quot;wishing&quot; for something to exist, and
<br>
you won't see it, even if it is in front of your very nose.
<br>
