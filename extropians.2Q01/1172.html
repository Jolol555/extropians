<p><em>&gt;I dispute this claim.  By what measure has the Fed managed inflation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stephen Horwitz points out in his recent book _Microfoundations and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Macroeconomics: An Austrian Perspective_, the total costs of inflation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are much than higher than the conventional measures. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, during the possibly past boom, there have been periods where 
<br>
rational people concluded there was no inflation because the gov't
<br>
measures don't account for quality improvements.  Also, in the
<br>
sense that, whatever the costs may be, we can obviously live with
<br>
them, and the Fed doesn't *have* to stop inflation.  A little
<br>
inflation may be bad, but significant deflation can be catastrophic,
<br>
as nominal interest rates can't go negative and there's no good
<br>
way for the banking system to handle that.  Japan has flirted
<br>
with that particular pickle several times recently; certainly
<br>
short-term rates of 0.2% are going to cause their own kinds of
<br>
costly distortions. Inflation may be acceptable insurance against that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are unrecoverable costs of inflating period, mainly because of how any
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;change in monetary equilibrium does not evenly flow through the economy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but is it significant?  It's not like the gov't isn't extremely costly 
<br>
anyway.
<br>
And what's the value of &quot;deflation insurance&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't know enough about the Japanese example, though I think there several
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;problems with government intervention there, including a long period of
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;inflation, price rigidities (set by law), and massive subsidies. 
</em><br>
<p>No, yes, yes.  Low inflation for ages.  Lots of detrimental gov't 
<br>
intervention;
<br>
besides what you mention, land use distortion, corruption, stock price 
<br>
propping, and vast waste.   It's scary that in just a decade Japan went
<br>
from being the most solvent gov't in the West to one where default
<br>
comes under consideration.  They borrowed and spent *trillions* to
<br>
stimulate the economy, with minimal benefit.  Exhibit A against 
<br>
Keynesianism.
