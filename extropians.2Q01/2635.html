</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I should point out that this left-anarchist definition of &quot;property&quot; is
<br>
being defined in terms of an equally tricky concept of &quot;exploitation,&quot; and
<br>
that the term &quot;monopoly&quot; is used here in a very odd sense with little
<br>
connection to its use in the economic literature.
<br>
<p>The economically meaningful definition of a monopoly is: a situation where
<br>
a monopolist &quot;can secure higher net proceeds by selling a smaller quantity
<br>
of his product at a higher price than by selling a greater quantity at a
<br>
lower price.&quot; (von Mises, _Human Action_, XV.6)  It does not mean simply
<br>
private control over a commodity.  I can own a number of houses and rent
<br>
them out, but (whether my ownership is protected by a national government,
<br>
by a private defense agency, or just by me and my family with lots of guns)
<br>
I won't be able to significantly increase the market price of housing by
<br>
boarding up some of my own houses, and therefore all of my supply will be
<br>
made available at the market rate.  The concept of monopoly used here is
<br>
any sort of protected claim of ownership to something that is a factor of
<br>
production rather than a personal consumptive item, IOW &quot;property.&quot;
<br>
<p>Left-anarchists feel they can make this distinction between &quot;possessions&quot;
<br>
and &quot;property&quot; because they don't understand the productive role played by
<br>
the wise alignment of capital by entrepreneurs.  What a left-anarchist
<br>
calls &quot;exploitation&quot; is really just making wealth by correctly deciding
<br>
what most needs to get done rather than by doing the getting-done.  But the
<br>
former is just an example of the latter, a skill that happens to be
<br>
exceedingly rare and therefore carries a high price.
