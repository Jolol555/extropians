Personally, I think this is where the decision to not Open Source the
<br>
project or at least aspects of it hurts a lot.  If a Flare SourceForge
<br>
project was started it wouldn't take much more than a face-to-face or
<br>
exchange of emails with interested individuals after a very short few
<br>
pages (or less) for the initial project description.  If some of these
<br>
parts are done with OS then you don't need to wait to hire a paid
<br>
full-time lead.  
<br>
<p>Some of us who would very much like to donate time/energy will not write
<br>
any significant code unless we are assured that code is Open Source. 
<br>
<p>On the face of it, basing a language on XML makes very little sense to
<br>
me.  Lisp is far more flexible. XML is made for distributing data that
<br>
is partially self documenting.  It is highly redundant and the encoding
<br>
is elementary and inefficient.  You could easily get the parts you want
<br>
from it, as I understand it, using frames and slots or property lists
<br>
and so on in a language like Lisp and have all much of the machinery
<br>
already in place to do development, debugging and so on.  To write a
<br>
program language in XML with tags is to go down the same dumb  rat-hole
<br>
that many Web Servers have.  It is a gross and inefficient way to define
<br>
programs.  You need tools that speed thought and development not ones
<br>
that bore real programmers to death.
<br>
<p>Writing a language for AI is not a proprietary or one team undertaking.  
<br>
<p>Why do some of the sparse papers out there talk of implementinf Flare in
<br>
C++? There is no need from an efficiency point of view.  Lisp can be as
<br>
optimized just as much and is much more flexible. 
<br>
<p>The idea of &quot;domdules&quot; that contain semantic and usage information about
<br>
modules is a good one.  The tricky part is having good semantic language
<br>
conventions that are computable.  That itself is not a small research
<br>
project.

<em>&gt; You missed my point.  You will remain as one full-time guy until you

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That doesn't mean white papers.  That means *running code*, or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the framework of such (at least pseudocode with no &quot;undefined magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens here&quot; bits), which you then won't have to rewrite for various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architectures (code mongers can port your stuff to their platforms:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; porting is a common operation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm sorry if I managed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to give you the impression that it was just a couple of weeks, way back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when, but we can't start implementing Flare until we have at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; full-time person to run the project, and I've been too busy working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Friendly AI&quot; - am *still* too busy - to write anything up on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're in such a rush to complete your project, you don't have time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete your project.  It's a common malady/paradox among modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects, though it's more visible among commercial projects (since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they ship their buggy, incomplete, rushed project anyway, on a schedule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close to what their developers originally estimated but with an attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do it in half the time, and the other half trying to patch up that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is to say, I was volunteering to *be* that &quot;full-time person&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run Flare, but I couldn't since you failed to get me the info; other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people look at what you have, see a total lack of specs one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop from, and don't bother even to ask, assuming that those specs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't and won't exist.  My situation has changed in light of this and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things, and I may no longer be in a position to write Flare - but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suggestion: write up and post what you have, then mostly forget about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it until someone (in a similar situation as I was) starts writing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without your oversight.  Get it ready for handoff, so it can take off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with minimal, maybe zero, further input of your time afterwards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question to the rest of the list: I'm sure someone else can see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point I'm trying to make.  Can anyone else state it in a clearer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion, such that Eliezer can see the path out of being a perpetual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-man job?  (A certain set of actions will be necessary; funding is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the only path, nor even the one most likely to get results if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding and a biz plan are not actively pursued.)
