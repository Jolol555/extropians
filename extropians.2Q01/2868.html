By our (okay, my) standards, the universe is quite clearly amoral. 
<br>
Explain morality? Gee, kinda difficult. As hizzonor said of 
<br>
pornography, I know it when I see it (and it's my flavor). There's a 
<br>
tribe which always roasts their monkeys alive before consuming them. 
<br>
I don't know why; it's even possible they feel this is the only way 
<br>
to properly liberate the spirit for a happy afterlife, or whatever--
<br>
and could be a function of their own &quot;morality.&quot; (Thus making 
<br>
morality a product of culture.)
<br>
<p>But I'd still stay the hell away from them.
<br>
<p>I don't know that I can properly explain the basis of morality, but 
<br>
I'm stuck with it, and prefer the company of others so afflicted.
<br>
<p>We're nicer folk.

&gt; 
&gt; Morality is NOT a human construct!  The idea that morality obtains
&gt; &gt;from culture is one of the most harmful ideas of the 20th century,
&gt; whose insidious consequences can hardly be overstated.  (To be sure,
&gt; traditions and laws issue injunctions as added layers.)
&gt; 
&gt; To a great degree, our morality is in our genes.  (See Matt Ridley,
&gt; &quot;The Origins of Virtue&quot;, and other recent works, email me for list.)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And I'd argue that it is perfectly rational to conclude that
&gt; &gt; such behavior [murder, mayhem, and genocide] is unacceptable,
&gt; &gt; dangerous to society, and not to be tolerated.  One needn't
&gt; &gt; exercise or indeed possess emotions to reach this conclusion.
&gt; 
&gt; It's certainly not irrational to find murder, mayhem, and genocide
&gt; unacceptable, and I too advocate that we not tolerate it.  But I
&gt; don't understand how you base your value judgments, ultimately, on
&gt; anything besides emotion, including your basic &quot;wants&quot;.  Care to
&gt; explain?  (Hint: start with the big questions, why do we want to
&gt; live, why if we live do want to live we want to be better off
&gt; rather than worse off, why should there be anyone but me (or us).)
&gt; 
&gt; And avoid begging the question with &quot;well, evolution made us that
&gt; way&quot;.  True, but we already know that---that's how we got our
&gt; emotions.
