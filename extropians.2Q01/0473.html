<p>Hackers become terrorists under new law
<br>
<p>By Will Knight
<br>
<p>Computer hackers could be classed as terrorists under a UK law that
<br>
came into force today.
<br>
<p>The Terrorism Act 2000 is designed to prevent dissident political
<br>
groups from using the UK as a base for terrorism and recognises a new
<br>
threat from cyberterrorists for the first time.
<br>
<p>But the Act also significantly widens the definition of terrorism to
<br>
include those actions that &quot;seriously interfere with or seriously
<br>
disrupt an electronic system&quot;. According to the Act this only applies
<br>
to actions &quot;designed to influence the government or to intimidate the
<br>
public&quot;, but it will be up to police investigators to decide when
<br>
this is the case. The Act gives police the power to detain suspects
<br>
for 48-hours without a warrant.
