<p>Yes.  Quite right.  I apologize for what I wrote.  (I was in a
<br>
very bad mood, and still need to learn not to write email when
<br>
I'm like that.)  Not only should you write a program when you've
<br>
(temporarily) given up working on a problem, but, depending on
<br>
many factors, one might find the program more edifying.
<br>
<p>The only danger that I know of, is that getting the answer 
<br>
sometimes causes people to believe that they understand the
<br>
answer.  Looking up the answer to an exercise in the back of
<br>
the book is exactly the same:  while often you oughtta, just
<br>
to make some progress, there still lies before you the goal
<br>
of actually understanding the exercise.
