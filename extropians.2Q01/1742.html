<em>&gt; I think that godhood is relative matter:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we were to create a simulation of other universe in computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would satisfy the requirements for your 'Type I God'. We have ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to chance laws of our simulation but we were still restricted by the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our universe. 'Type II Gods' can exist then, absolute power is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But would 'Type III God' be possible and would that need &quot;alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics'? Perhaps you philosophers know can such a thing exist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what would it be? A set of theorems impossible to prove with theorems from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another set?
</em><br>
<p>Being the religiously mathematical mathematician that I am, I simply don't
<br>
buy the possibility of existence of a Type III God. That's one of the main
<br>
reasons I am pronouncedly not a Christian.
<br>
<p>The thing is, that in a system -- where the laws of logic as well as a few
<br>
starting points are taken to be axiomatic -- such as mathematics, the
<br>
possibility of violating the laws of the system simply is not there within
<br>
the system. And stepping out of the system is just that -- and it's simple
<br>
to violate the laws of a system while not in it.
<br>
<p>I could elaborate and make it clearer what I'm talking about --- but not at
<br>
this time of day...
