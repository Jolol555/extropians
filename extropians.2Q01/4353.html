<p>They are using a quantum O(k) algorithm to replace normal O(k) methods 
<br>
(e.g. linear hashes), and it wouldn't even address the more useful O(log) 
<br>
methods (e.g. B*tree) that can be used for things like indexing for range 
<br>
scans.  And in any case, the large collection of indexing algorithms 
<br>
currently known tend to be extremely scalable on normal hardware for the 
<br>
most part.  The biggest benefit from the quantum technique is that it might 
<br>
save space normally allocated for indexes.  In most real world cases, the 
<br>
benefit of a quantum database lookup might be a small increase in retrieval 
<br>
performance, which I suspect is probably not worth the additional cost of 
<br>
the special hardware (as opposed to just buying faster/bigger ordinary 
<br>
hardware).  I guess I just don't see a real benefit in this type of case; 
<br>
if the entire computer was already a quantum optical system, then I would 
<br>
expect the databases to already support this feature where it made sense.
<br>
<p>Quantum techniques would seem to be much more useful for exhaustively 
<br>
sifting key spaces that are too large to actually be stored anywhere, or 
<br>
for which a physical record doesn't need to exist.
