</em><br>
<p>Do you realize how many top-notch people worked on the problem? How
<br>
many today's $$$s a few G$ in 1940s are?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what your &quot;very specific set of methods&quot; is.  Not having any

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm referring to the only tried and true method. Sometimes, when I look
<br>
into the bathroom mirror, or read the newspaper, I have my doubts it really 
<br>
worked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe I have a complete and workable design for a real Ai, but I don't

</em><br>
<p>Ha! I can top that. I don't have a complete and workable design for a 
<br>
real AI, heavensforbid. It would cover most of the Sahara with documentation.
<br>
What I do have, is metaheuristics, a recipe. Two, actually.
<br>
<p>You want to make a machine think? Look at prior art. Grab a thinking
<br>
critter off the street and stuff him into the machine. 
<br>
<p>Plan two: figure out, how said critters came into being, figure
<br>
out a decent point of departure, and do a fast-forward replay 
<br>
of the above in machina.
<br>
<p>Both plans differ from yours that they don't require superhuman 
<br>
genius to execute. Sorry Eliezer, you're out of work. Sure, 
<br>
they nontrivial, large-scale projects, but with a clear structure, 
<br>
progress metric, and validated by existance proof.
<br>
<p>Of course you'll burn many computronium mole-hours just for the
<br>
initial search in the parameter space. Then, you can start with
<br>
the *real* work. Which might require computronium km^3-centuries.
<br>
Then it might not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; my design is one among many possible workable real AI designs.  I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding **necessary and sufficient conditions** for a real AI design is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard math problem, significantly harder than finding sufficient conditions,
</em><br>
<p>Here's where we differ, again. I don't think it's a math problem at all.
<br>
At least not the sort of math you learn at school, or what monkeys do
<br>
and can do. I might have to retract that statement, though, depending 
<br>
on what that mondo Wolfram dude comes out with next.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which is all we need to do to build one.  I can't help but suspect that your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidence is unfounded.
</em><br>
<p>I sure as hell hope so. A real AI could clean ruin your day.
