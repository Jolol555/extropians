<p>Since this is still the Made in China thread, I can't help wondering, OK, 
<br>
but why do you want to boycott goods made in China (you mentioned this in a 
<br>
related post a few days ago)?  Surely you don't think that most Chinese 
<br>
factories use child labor or have sweatshop conditions?
<br>
<p>One of my best friends spent most of the last five years inspecting numerous 
<br>
factories all over Southern China, and a lot of factories in other parts of 
<br>
mainland China.  Not once did he encounter sweatshop conditions, let alone 
<br>
child or other forms of coercive labor.
<br>
<p>I've been to mainland China around eight times myself, and have had candid 
<br>
discussions with numerous individuals, on politics, economics and other 
<br>
subjects.  Not once has anyone even hinted at a wish for foreigners to stop 
<br>
buying Chinese products as a way of pressuring their government to treat its 
<br>
people better.  On the contrary, Chinese people I've spoken with are quite 
<br>
pleased with the progress their country has made over the past two decades, 
<br>
and they're well aware that the main spur for this progress has been their 
<br>
government's economic reforms, first implemented by Deng Xiaoping.
<br>
<p>As recently as the late seventies, China was something akin to North Korea 
<br>
today, with the vast majority of the population living in grinding povery, 
<br>
and segments of society living close to starvation.  Since Deng's reforms 
<br>
started, real average income has quadrupled, and almost everyone's standard 
<br>
of living is much higher than it was.  This trend should continue, as long 
<br>
as Western protectionists don't succeed in closing overseas markets to 
<br>
Chinese goods (and other factors, of course, but I'm keeping these comments 
<br>
relevant to this thread).
<br>
<p>If enough Americans were to decide to stop buying Chinese goods, the effect 
<br>
would be the same as if a protectionist like Pat Buchanan were to become 
<br>
President, and equally tragic: it would cut off the flow of oxygen to 
<br>
China's economy.
<br>
<p>Since reforms first began, haltingly in 1978, the pattern in China has been 
<br>
that in times of strong economic growth, liberals in the government such as 
<br>
Premier Zhu Rongzi have managed to hold a lot of clout, and be successful in 
<br>
pushing through further liberal, capitalist reforms.  The process builds on 
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>However, in times of economic stagnation or crisis with the West (such as 
<br>
the aftermath of the embassy bombing in Belgrade, for example, not to 
<br>
mention the current problems in Hainan Province) the anti-progress Communist 
<br>
hardliners in government tend to gain ground, and criticism of the liberals 
<br>
becomes louder.
<br>
<p>It's always hard to predict the future, but as far as I can tell, the 
<br>
effects of a large-scale boycott of Chinese-made goods would have the 
<br>
primary effect of slowing or even reversing the liberal, pro-freedom trend 
<br>
in China (there would be other negative effects, but again, I'm keeping this 
<br>
relevant to the thread).
<br>
<p>I buy Chinese-made goods all the time and have absolutely no qualms about 
<br>
doing so.
