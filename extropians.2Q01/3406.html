ok, now I think I should try to explain what happened in our dimension: Brian, 
<br>
who dislikes cynical critisism (especially when it is used to point out weaknesses 
<br>
without providing a possible solution for getting rid of them), read: &quot;The 
<br>
Extropians aren't ready for prime time.&quot; That was a slap in his face - Boom! 
<br>
There it was, without further explanation, without a &quot;But this is just my opinion&quot;, 
<br>
without providing a possible solution to the problem.
<br>
To Brian it looked you didn't know what you were talking about. No wonder he 
<br>
was upset. But he didn't swing his fists at you. That's just your imagination. He 
<br>
just said basically (or let's say that was what he intended to say): &quot;Get out, 
<br>
educate yourself better about what you want to critizise, then come back.&quot;
