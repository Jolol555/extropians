<p>There might be shadows of reality, that is to say, parallel universes, but they are
<br>
not so different.  Think about it in terms of locality.  If they were like shadows
<br>
then they would be the result of some kind of light-like projective thing.
<br>
<p>And, all our scientific evidence points to our one true reality.  Global warming is
<br>
already here, for example, and steps actually do have to be taken to deal with the
<br>
effects of largescale socioeconomic practices.
<br>
<p>So, when we talk about chaos, we are probably talking about different things.  Also,
<br>
consider the prefix &quot;anti-&quot; for any noun.  For example, &quot;anti-reality&quot;, or
<br>
&quot;anti-chaos&quot;.
<br>
<p>I have posted some of my opinions on quantum reality before.  For example, there is
<br>
waveform, and waveform dualism and trialism, for example, as metaphors.
