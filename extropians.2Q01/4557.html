<p>Do you still need to build houses when you have nano? Such capabilities 
<br>
as described do not arise overnight. A few tango rounds of the world
<br>
dancing with their precursors, and their precursors precursors might
<br>
make a lot of difference cumulatively. We're habitually waffling about 
<br>
shrinking prediction horizonts here, but we sometimes have trouble to 
<br>
eat our own dogfood.
<br>
<p>I've just written a private email to a guy off wear-hard, trying to sketch 
<br>
out the next 30 years in computing, and I realized the particular set of 
<br>
scenarios described was starting to unravel in front of my eyes. The possible 
<br>
future trajectory funnel is fanning up exponentially, or even 
<br>
superexponentially. I still sent it, but what I should have said instead
<br>
was: &quot;next 30 years in computing? Wish I had a clue&quot;. It's all heavy
<br>
haze, the farther you look, the less you can tell for certain. 
<br>
That's a Nissan at the neighbour's garage, that's probably a refinery 
<br>
over there, it's a bit hard to tell, and there... Um, yeah that could 
<br>
be a mountain. Or a cloud. Whatever.
<br>
<p>We're far from being omniscient, and the system noise present at each
<br>
step plus divergence drive the funneling up of future trajectories.
<br>
<p>I think it's really more constructive and more fun to predict the future 
<br>
by inventing it. Unfortunately, few people would wish to pump megabucks
<br>
into somethiang with a very uncertain ROI, decade-delayed at that. It 
<br>
pays much better not even investing in a better mousetrap (or, as one Jewish 
<br>
businessman told me 15 years ago, invent something &lt;insert the functionality 
<br>
of Propecia and Viagra here&gt;, and you would be swimming in cash), just do 
<br>
insurance, or real estate. Even investing in tulip bulbs would have 
<br>
worked until a year ago.
<br>
<p>Which kinda takes all the wind out of the wild dreamer's sails.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; into the rough building, then let a second stage of slower nano-growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do the integration. The parts that need only to be bulk are quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made, while the complexity on the different scales (macro and nano) are
</em><br>
