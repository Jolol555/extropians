<p>[snip --DBM]
<br>
<p>Dear Judge Wallerstein:
<br>
<p>The Scientologists see the decision in my case as a great victory over one 
<br>
of their critics.  I think a much larger number of people will come to see 
<br>
the result as a serious miscarriage of justice and an assault on free speech.
<br>
<p>I don't believe any of us fully anticipated the effects of your pretrial 
<br>
rulings on restricting testimony about the deaths of Ashlee Shaner, Stacy 
<br>
Moxon Meyer and Lisa McPherson, or restricting testimony on Scientology 
<br>
beliefs and practices.  Mr. Harr stuck to the letter of your rulings and 
<br>
once even stopped DDA Robert Schwarz from having read into the record a 
<br>
reference in exhibit 23 to Stacy Moxon Meyer (&quot;for the latest victim&quot;).
<br>
<p>But the effect, as you can see from the below declaration was to mislead 
<br>
the jury into thinking that my use of &quot;destroy them utterly&quot; (quotes in my 
<br>
posting) was a threat when it was understood by virtually all 
<br>
alt.religion.scientogy readers to be a reference to Scientology's fair game 
<br>
threats and practices against critics.
<br>
<p>The below declaration may be filed in court early next week, with a motion 
<br>
to reconsider JNOV.  Unfortunately, this is non-standard practice, so I 
<br>
have to go pro se to file it.  If it would be permissible for Jim Harr to 
<br>
come back in for sentencing on May 16 after substituting out so I can file 
<br>
this, I would greatly appreciate someone from your office telling him so.
<br>
<p>Thank you very much,
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
<br>
<p><p><p>[DRAFT]  DECLARATION OF KEITH HENSON
<br>
IN SUPPORT OF A MOTION TO RECONSIDER
<br>
JNOV
<br>
<p><p>PEOPLE v. HENSON  HEM014371
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Keith Henson, declare:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information set forth in this declaration is known to
<br>
me personally.  If called upon to testify in court as to the
<br>
truthfulness of the facts set forth in this declaration, I would
<br>
do so.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   In the just completed trial, defense was forbidden by
<br>
the court under Evidence Code 352 from raising issues of
<br>
Scientology beliefs or practices, such as &quot;fair game&quot; or TR-L
<br>
(Training Routine Lying) and also from mentioning the reason
<br>
Henson was picketing, the deaths which occurred in May and June of
<br>
2000.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   As a result of the first restriction, defense was not able to 
<br>
dispute the testimony of Ken Hoden on the stand, even though defense knew 
<br>
Mr. Hoden was not telling the truth because this would have led right into 
<br>
TR-L, a Scientology belief or practice.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.   As a specific example (and defendant is relying on
<br>
memory of testimony rather than a transcript) Mr. Hoden claimed
<br>
to have known for 25 years the woman (Helen Burke) who was shot
<br>
in the Portland facility of Scientology in 1996.  His testimony
<br>
was that her unborn baby had been shot through the head and that
<br>
Scientology had not taken threats by the assailant (Godeka)
<br>
seriously after threats had been made.  Defendant knew both
<br>
statements were untrue and told his lawyer in court because
<br>
defendant had closely followed this tragic story as it unfolded.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhibit A is the initial report of the shootings, Exhibit B
<br>
reports the safe birth of the woman's child, Bridget, a few
<br>
months after the shooting, hardly something which could have
<br>
happened if the unborn child had been shot through the head!
<br>
Exhibit C reports sentencing Godeka, judged guilty but insane.
<br>
Exhibits A and C mention that Godeka was under a court order at
<br>
the time of the rampage, strongly implying Scientology *had*
<br>
taken Godeka's threats seriously.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the biggest omission from the testimony is that Godeka was a 
<br>
Scientologist, who had spent a lot of money on Scientology and
<br>
who wanted $50,000 from Scientology for &quot;ruining his life.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientology has had far more trouble with current and
<br>
former Scientologist becoming violent than critics becoming
<br>
violent.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defendant understood (perhaps incorrectly) from his attorney that he 
<br>
could not point out Hoden's testimony was false because any defendant's 
<br>
testimony as to why Hoden was lying would lead directly into fair game, 
<br>
TR-L and other Scientology beliefs and practices, and delving into such 
<br>
subjects would have been a violation of the court's order.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.   The same violation of the court's orders would have
<br>
resulted from defendant trying to explain Exhibits 23-23A, which has the 
<br>
quoted words &quot;destroy them utterly.&quot;  This, as Exhibit D (search
<br>
results for these words of over 1000 web pages from www.google.com) shows 
<br>
is a common paraphrase of the last three words of Scientology's &quot;fair game 
<br>
policy&quot; (&quot;. . . if possible, of course, ruin him
<br>
utterly.&quot;).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoting an opponents words is a time honored tradition in
<br>
public debate and these words were instantly recognized as a Scientology 
<br>
reference by those participating in debate on the news group in which the 
<br>
posting was made (they were used unquoted in another posting exhibit by 
<br>
&quot;Bev&quot; to which the defendant responded &quot;. . . the latter task seem[s] easier&quot;).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reference to the &quot;fair game&quot; threat *by Scientology* toward 
<br>
critics (who are also known as enemy or &quot;suppressive persons&quot; in the fair 
<br>
game policy) almost certainly was seen by the jury as a threat against 
<br>
Scientologists *by the defendant*.  This perception could not be corrected 
<br>
because of the court's restrictions about mentioning Scientology beliefs or 
<br>
practices under Evidence Code 352.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even allowing the jury to see the un-redacted version of the posting 
<br>
would have been exculpatory, since the next paragraph makes clear that my 
<br>
means to &quot;destroy them utterly&quot; was a series of pickets.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the
<br>
State of California that the above is true and correct.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executed on April 27, 2001 at Palo Alto, California.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith Henson
