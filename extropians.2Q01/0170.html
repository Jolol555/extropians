<p>Other Trek sites are suggesting that the proposed character outline may 
<br>
be a hoax.  <a href="http://treknation.com/syfyworld/g20010304a.shtml">http://treknation.com/syfyworld/g20010304a.shtml</a> writes:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, doing something in the past would be counter-productive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to what the Star Trek franchise is trying to achieve. It would be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult to give this crew in the 22nd century the 1960s phasers,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having the 1960s computer talking, and putting flashing lights and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;switches everywhere.
<br>
<p>I think this would be a good point: giving them decent-looking
<br>
technology (i.e. something more advanced than what we have today) would
<br>
be anachronistic, but sticking with what was shown in the 60s series
<br>
would look unbelievably hokey today.
<br>
<p>So hopefully this is just the product of someone's imagination.  However I
<br>
agree that it is unfortunate that whoever created it thought that making
<br>
the villain be interested in genetic engineering made sense.  Of course
<br>
even back with the Khan character, one of his villainous traits was that
<br>
he was a genetic superman.
