Found this in my mailbox. I don't QUITE agree with all of it, and one 
<br>
point makes no sense--but, hey, I like it. I refrained from posting 
<br>
the Heston speech before, thinking it might not be appropriate--so 
<br>
this time I'm taking the plunge. And, yes, a cop sent it to me...
<br>
<p>Am I A BAD American?
<br>

<br>
I like big cars, big boats, big houses, and naturally - Great Legs 
<br>

<br>
I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some 
<br>
middle-aged governmental functionary with a bad comb-over that wants 
<br>
to give 
<br>
it away to crack addicts squirting out babies. I don't care about 
<br>
appearing compassionate. 
<br>

<br>
I think playing with toy guns doesn't make you a killer. 
<br>

<br>
I believe it's called the Boy Scouts for a reason. 
<br>

<br>
I think I'm doing better than the homeless. 
<br>

<br>
I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized. 
<br>

<br>
I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are 
<br>
different, 
<br>
weird or piss me off. 
<br>

<br>
I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it. Hell 
<br>
just 
<br>
ask my wife. 
<br>

<br>
I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy queen shake, pack of 
<br>
cigarettes, or hotel room you do it in English. 
<br>

<br>
As a matter of fact, if you are an American citizen you should speak 
<br>
English. My father and grandfather shouldn't have to die in vain so 
<br>
you can 
<br>
leave the countries you were born in to come disrespect ours. 
<br>

<br>
I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry ass if you're 
<br>
running from them after they tell you to stop. If you can't 
<br>
understand the 
<br>
word freeze or stop in English, See the previous line. 
<br>

<br>
I don't use the excuse &quot;it's for the children&quot; as a shield for 
<br>
unpopular 
<br>
opinions or actions. 
<br>

<br>
If I received oral sex from one of my subordinate employees in my 
<br>
office, it wouldn't be a private matter or my personal business. I 
<br>
would 
<br>
have been FIRED immediately. 
<br>

<br>
I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a machine 
<br>
with 
<br>
no political affiliation recount when needed. 
<br>

<br>
I know what the definition of lying is. 
<br>

<br>
I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you 
<br>
qualify 
<br>
for any special loan programs, govm't sponsored bank loans, etc., so 
<br>
you 
<br>
can open a hotel, c-store, trinket shop, or any damn thing else. 
<br>

<br>
I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet. 
<br>

<br>
I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks. 
<br>

<br>
I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne, Ice-T 
<br>
or 
<br>
Marilyn Manson sang, but that doesn't mean I want to listen to that 
<br>
crap from someone else's car when I'm stopped at a red light. But I 
<br>
respect 
<br>
your right to. 
<br>

<br>
I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment 
<br>
than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box. 
<br>

<br>
I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite or 
<br>
fat-free 
<br>
on the package. 
<br>

<br>
We did not go to some foreign country and risk lives in vain to 
<br>
defend 
<br>
our constitution so that decades later you can tell us it's a living 
<br>
document ever changing and is open to interpretation. 
<br>

<br>
I don't hate the rich. 
<br>

<br>
I don't pity the poor. 
<br>

<br>
I know wrestling is fake. 
<br>

<br>
I've never owned or was a slave, and a large percentage of our 
<br>
forefathers 
<br>
weren't wealthy enough to own one either. 
<br>

<br>
I believe a self-righteous liberal with a cause is more dangerous 
<br>
than a 
<br>
Hell's Angel with an attitude. 
<br>

<br>
I own a gun, you can own a gun, and any red blooded American should 
<br>
be 
<br>
allowed to own a gun, but if you use it in a crime then you will 
<br>
serve 
<br>
the time. A rubber band and a paper clip is a dangerous weapon in 
<br>
the hands 
<br>
of someone with malicious intent. 
<br>

<br>
I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and 
<br>
continue to make more. If it pisses you off, invent the next 
<br>
operating 
<br>
system that's better and put your name on the building. Ask your 
<br>
buddy that 
<br>
invented the Internet to help you. 
<br>

<br>
We don't need more laws! Let's enforce the ones we already have. 
<br>

<br>
I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child, it takes a 
<br>
parent 
<br>
with the balls to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say 
<br>
&quot;NO.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
I think tattoos and piercing are fine if you want them, but please 
<br>
don't 
<br>
pretend they are a political statement. 
<br>

<br>
I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a kid. 
<br>

<br>
I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep 
<br>
silent because I have these beliefs and opinions. I thought this 
<br>
country 
<br>
allowed me that right. I will not conform or compromise just to keep 
<br>
from 
<br>
hurting somebody's feelings. 
<br>

<br>
I am sick to death of &quot;Political Correctness&quot;. 
<br>

<br>
I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the 
<br>
mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise. 
<br>

<br>
Yes, I guess by their definition, I'm a bad American.
<br>
