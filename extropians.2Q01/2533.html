Travas Gunnell wrote a post about sweatshops that
<br>
began:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A sweatshop involves much more than just being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underpaid.  Sweatshops typically feature several of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the following: threats and intimidation, human rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abuses...
</em><br>
<p>At the end of the post, there appeared a very large
<br>
number of links, one of which I clicked on by accident
<br>
(I swear).  And in it beheld...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; C.7.1 What role does class struggle play in the business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycle?  At its most basic, the class struggle (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance to hierarchy in all its forms) is the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause of the business cycle.  As we argued in section
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B.1.2 and section C.2, capitalists in order to exploit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a worker must first oppress them. But where there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppression, there is resistance; where there is authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is the will to freedom. Hence capitalism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marked by a continuous struggle between worker and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boss at the point of production as well as struggle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside of the workplace against other forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hierarchy.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ah, it makes me nostalgic for the old days.  It has
<br>
been so long since I savored good old Marxist prose,
<br>
&quot;class struggle&quot;, &quot;exploitation&quot;, and &quot;oppression&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Well, at least it proves that ideas can never die,
<br>
which may be good.  Or, maybe not.
