<p>
So, it's 4AM.  I'm procrastinating, as these days I tend to alternate
<br>
between states in which I'm not motivated to work or too terrified of
<br>
not getting everything done to do anything at all productive.  This is
<br>
almost certainly contributing to the rather severe insomnia which I
<br>
have acquired.
<br>
<p>So I decide to do something.  What shall I do?  I stumble across an
<br>
article with a funny quip.  &quot;Back then, 'fancy HTML' meant using
<br>
&lt;BLINK&gt; tags.&quot;  (You may have seen it... it was in Salon all this
<br>
weekend.)
<br>
<p>&lt;BLINK&gt; tags, for those who don't know, are one of the most hated
<br>
developments in HTML, well, ever.  Netscape was originally responsible
<br>
for the &lt;BLINK&gt; tag when it first began to rewrite the language in
<br>
which the WWW was written.
<br>
<p>That language was HTML, the HyperText Markup Language, designed by
<br>
now-famous Tim Berners-Lee, based on the musings of the not-so-famous
<br>
Ted Nelson.  Nelson is a truly fascinating character in his own
<br>
right.
<br>
<p>Writing before there was an Internet, or even before there were
<br>
personal computers, Nelson envisioned a world in which people would
<br>
sit at computer screens in their own homes and read books on those
<br>
screens, much like a television.  But the book they would be reading
<br>
wouldn't be like an ordinary book displayed on a screen... no, it
<br>
would be hypertext.
<br>
<p>The difference between text and hypertext, as Ted Nelson imagined it,
<br>
was that hypertext would be directly connected to other related text.
<br>
If I'd posted a paragraph or two about Ted Nelson, much like this one
<br>
and you wanted to read more about him, or perhaps read his books, or
<br>
read those who had criticized him, you could do so simply by touching
<br>
the article on the screen.  These connections between pieces of
<br>
hypertext (or &quot;links&quot;) would be painstakingly forged by the users of
<br>
hypertext themselves.  We would all contribute these links to a giant
<br>
database which could keep everything straight.
<br>
<p>Of course, the &quot;linking&quot; needn't stop at text.  Nelson imagined
<br>
hypervideo, hypermusic, hyperart of all kinds.  He immediately saw the
<br>
need to have some sort of content filtering mechanism, so you saw what
<br>
you were looking for immediately (or as quickly as possible).  But he
<br>
also insisted that you be unable to block out links to criticism and
<br>
such.  He called his project Xanadu, and, if it worked as designed,
<br>
Nelson believed that it could literally save the world.
<br>
<p>I happen to share some of his optimism about that.  However, his
<br>
project was considerably more difficult than he had imagined.  Some
<br>
parts, the first parts, were easy.  There were many hard parts,
<br>
however.  Too many.  He failed miserably.
<br>
<p>Berners-Lee realized that Nelson's project was quite difficult.  So he
<br>
implemented only the very easiest part.  Using SGML (Standard
<br>
Generalized Markup Language), the international standard for text with
<br>
commentary on itself or &quot;markup,&quot; he devised a simpler version, HTML,
<br>
a simpler language in which you would markup your own text.  One kind
<br>
of markup that the designers of SGML had already anticipated was the
<br>
&quot;reference&quot; of one text to another.  Berners-Lee automated the process
<br>
of reference by inventing a tag that would say: &quot;this area of the text
<br>
X is about this other text Y, and here's how you can find it
<br>
electronically.&quot;  Berners-Lee's program would then automatically
<br>
retrieve the document for you if you ran that tag through a computer.
<br>
He called the tag a &quot;link&quot; and declared that hypertext had finally
<br>
arrived.
<br>
<p>This wasn't a &quot;link&quot; of the kind that Nelson had originally imagined,
<br>
however.  Nelson's links worked both forward and backward.  That is,
<br>
suppose that I had written a piece of text about this fragment of a
<br>
soliloquy from Hamlet:
<br>
<p>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
<br>
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
<br>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
<br>
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
<br>
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
<br>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
<br>
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
<br>
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
<br>
Possess it merely.
<br>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of critics have already cited this speech, and I
<br>
have done so yet again.  (In this case, I cite it merely as a heavily
<br>
cited quotation.)  But even when I read it on the WWW, I cannot tell
<br>
who else on the WWW has written about this text, even if they have
<br>
linked to it in their own documents.
<br>
<p>This means that Nelson's nightmare has occurred: I can visit Nike's
<br>
hypertext page at <a href="http://www.nike.com">http://www.nike.com</a> and be unable to see the most
<br>
important criticism of Nike's business practices.  I'd never know that
<br>
Nike employed sweatshop labor, never even necessarily realize that
<br>
there was a debate ongoing as to what might be done about it.
<br>
Instead, I see only the links that Nike has chosen: mostly links to
<br>
other Nike affiliates, but most prominently to a Flash animation about
<br>
basketball players who wear Nike footwear.
<br>
<p>There were other blaring failures in HTML.  The first and by far the
<br>
most obvious flaw was that there was no way to incorporate anything
<br>
but text into hypertext.  This was tolerable when compared to its main
<br>
competitor, Gopher.  Both systems were probably designed under the
<br>
premise that the majority of users would be accessing these systems
<br>
from text-only terminals in schools and libraries.
<br>
<p>But it was lacking in other ways as well.  HTML was descended from
<br>
SGML, which, you'll recall, was the international standard for
<br>
commentary on text, better known today as meta-commentary.  I now feel
<br>
remiss in failing to point out earlier that, although SGML is an
<br>
international standard, almost no one actually uses it, except to
<br>
bastardize it by making it more specific.  Since all it was designed
<br>
to do was comment on the text, neither SGML nor HTML had any way to
<br>
describe, except in the most general terms, how the text would appear
<br>
on the page.  Instead, SGML/HTML text would have &quot;tags&quot; which would
<br>
tell you what the text was.  The &lt;HEAD&gt; tag, for example, would
<br>
enclose the header of a document.  The &lt;TITLE&gt; tag, which would appear
<br>
in the header, would enclose the document's title.  So reasonable SGML
<br>
might read like this:
<br>
<p>&lt;HEAD&gt;
<br>
&lt;TITLE&gt; Twelfth Night &lt;/TITLE&gt;
<br>
&lt;SUBTITLE&gt; What You Will &lt;/SUBTITLE&gt;
<br>
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
<br>
<p>These tags don't tell you anything about how the text should actually
<br>
LOOK, obviously.  The header might appear at the top of a page in the
<br>
center in bold in a larger font, or it might appear in the same size
<br>
font, like any other text, only in italics.  It might read &quot;Twelfth
<br>
Night, or What You Will,&quot; or it might just have &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;
<br>
written large and &quot;What You Will&quot; writ smaller just below that.
<br>
<p>Another tag which exemplifies this philosophy is the &lt;EM&gt; tag, where
<br>
EM is short for EMPHASIS, which states that the text which followed
<br>
was to be emphasized.  It didn't say whether that meant that the text
<br>
should be all in capital letters, or whether it should be in bold, or
<br>
underlined, or what.  It could even be blinking on and off, though, of
<br>
course, no one (presumably) would be quite that masochistic.
<br>
<p>The web really started to take off, however, when Mosaic was
<br>
designed.  Mosaic took HTML, which was an open standard which anybody
<br>
could implement as well or as poorly as they wanted, and added a new
<br>
tag: &lt;IMG&gt;, which is short for IMAGE.  The IMG tag allowed you to
<br>
include images in your documents, though not music or video or
<br>
anything else.
<br>
<p>Of course, the IMG tag didn't do anything on text-based terminals, for
<br>
which Berners-Lee had designed HTML.  It would put in some alternate
<br>
text, if you liked, or just the word [IMAGE] if not, just so you'd
<br>
know what you were missing.  So this tag only really worked if you ran
<br>
it on a high powered workstation, which nobody had back in those days,
<br>
or if you used it on your personal computer in your office or in your
<br>
home.
<br>
<p>Seeing this tag at work got the ball rolling for the WWW, because
<br>
Mosaic pages were beautiful.  (Or, at least, they could be.)  People
<br>
started to see what was possible for the Internet and the modem, and
<br>
pages started popping up everywhere.  To say &quot;and the rest was
<br>
history&quot; at this point would be ridiculous, but there's no doubt that
<br>
the &lt;IMG&gt; tag was crucial in bringing the complete works of William
<br>
Shakespeare onto the WWW:
<br>
<p><a href="http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/">http://tech-two.mit.edu/Shakespeare/</a>
<br>
<p>But this brings me to Netscape, and the blink tag.  Just as
<br>
Berners-Lee had broken hypertext to get a workable product, and the
<br>
designers of Mosaic had &quot;added&quot; on to HTML while still being fully
<br>
compatible with all of the old stuff, so Netscape started adding
<br>
dozens and then hundreds of new tags to HTML.  Since these tags were
<br>
popular, people started writing their web pages with these new
<br>
Netscape-only tags, which could be viewed only in the Netscape HTML
<br>
browser.  (This strategy would later come to be known as &quot;embrace and
<br>
extend:&quot; you embrace the standard, then you add things on to it, so
<br>
that only your product can be effectively usable.)
<br>
<p>One of the big developments which Netscape added was the capacity to
<br>
specify whether you wanted that text in &lt;BOLD&gt; or &lt;UNDERLINE&gt;, rather
<br>
than simply emphasized.  It would let you specify whether you wanted
<br>
your font size bigger or smaller.  And, worst of all, they added an
<br>
option to make the text blink on the page: &lt;BLINK&gt;
<br>
<p>If you enclosed your text in the &lt;BLINK&gt; tag, it would blink on and
<br>
off.  This was extremely difficult to read and quite distracting from
<br>
the rest of the page.  Everyone hated it.  But people noticed how
<br>
well it would grab your attention, so lots of people started using
<br>
it.  Since you had to use Netscape to view Netscape-only pages, you
<br>
had to take the risk of loading up a page with blinking text.
<br>
<p>Years have passed since this development, and now I'm using Internet
<br>
Explorer, thanks to the hard work of Microsoft, who embraced
<br>
Netscape's new tags and extended Netscape into financial obscurity.
<br>
And when I read that quotation with which I opened this page, &quot;Back
<br>
then, 'fancy HTML' meant using &lt;BLINK&gt; tags,&quot; I realized that I hadn't
<br>
seen blinking text in quite a long time.
<br>
<p>Nowadays HTML documents can contain animated pictures which fulfill
<br>
much the same purpose as the &lt;BLINK&gt; tag (if only by virtue of
<br>
distracting you from what you're trying to read).
<br>
<p>Suddenly, I was filled with nostalgia for the good old days.
<br>
<p>So I cracked open my text editor and wrote this:
<br>
<p>&lt;HTML&gt;
<br>
&lt;BODY&gt;
<br>
&lt;BLINK&gt; Hello world! &lt;/BLINK&gt;
<br>
&lt;/BODY&gt;
<br>
&lt;/HTML&gt;
<br>
<p>and opened it up in Internet Explorer v5.5.
<br>
<p>And nothing happened.
<br>
<p>It didn't blink at all.  It just sat there, welcoming itself to the
<br>
world in the most uninteresting way possible, for a web page.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, I still have a copy of Netscape around for just those
<br>
times when pages don't look quite right in Internet Explorer.  I
<br>
opened it up, and loading my page.  There it was, winking at me every
<br>
half a second.  Hello world!  Hello world!  Hello world!  Hello world!
<br>
<p>I quickly closed the window.
<br>
<p>And right there, right then, I knew the fruits of technological
<br>
progress.
