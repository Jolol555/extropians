<p>Zero, always feel free to smack me in the side of the head when
<br>
I have jumped one too many tracks (I often don't realize I may
<br>
have done it).
<br>
<p>This derives from conversations that Spike and I had about the
<br>
equivalence of matter and energy due to Einstein's (E = mc^2).
<br>
Using this you can assign a real &quot;cost&quot; to losing energy
<br>
(due to photon spreading due the inverse square law affecting
<br>
the strength of signals being transmitted -- photons you can't
<br>
receive with your &quot;detector&quot; are lost energy/matter) and the actual
<br>
&quot;matter&quot; lost due to ablation by interstellar particles during
<br>
interstellar transit at high velocities.
<br>
<p>You *can* encode the information on EM waves, but you lose
<br>
the value (read matter or energy) of that depending on the
<br>
transmission distance.  The further the distance, the more
<br>
of your investment you lose (unless you can guarantee
<br>
that the receiver is of sufficient size to capture all of
<br>
the photons you are transmitting -- across light-year
<br>
distances, that gets *really* big).
<br>
<p>Now, of course, you can confine the information preventing
<br>
it from spreading (by internal reflection) and that *is* what
<br>
fiber optics *is* all about.  It works great for the connection
<br>
of your brain to the NET (a few dozen meters perhaps).  It works
<br>
less great over a few hundred km (but the clever fiber people
<br>
have found ways of pumping up erbium atoms with excess laser
<br>
energy and then using this to amplify the actual signals
<br>
without converting the optical information stream to electrical
<br>
information and back to optical (which gets expensive, causes
<br>
losses, etc.) However, a fiber optic cable spanning a few light
<br>
years has serious problems (which I'm sure you can imagine).
<br>
<p>We do communicate with satellites, but it isn't with fiber
<br>
optic cables.  It is with directional microwave transmissions
<br>
(all those radio-satellite dishes you see on the top of
<br>
television stations).  They can effectively transmit to
<br>
the satellite or receive and focus data from the satellite
<br>
sufficiently to provide reliable transmission or reception
<br>
of signals.  However the question typically &quot;unexplored&quot;
<br>
is how much of the energy that is radiated by the transmitters
<br>
goes unreceived by the receivers???  Another way to think
<br>
about the question is -- how much of the transmission energy that
<br>
is radiated by your local cell-phone transmission tower (or your
<br>
local television broadcast antenna) is *NEVER* usefully received?
<br>
<p>My post was simply a commentary on the fact that if you
<br>
transmit your information as a &quot;probe&quot; (read tape/CD/letter)
<br>
it doesn't &quot;spread&quot; across interstellar distances.  It may
<br>
suffer from erosion, but if you send it moderately slowly
<br>
you can minimize this.  On the other hand if you attempt
<br>
to transmit data (as EM wave) at the speed of light, your
<br>
information spreads, and unless the receiver has really big
<br>
antennas a large fraction of this gets lost.
<br>
<p>It all comes down to the fundamental question in communication --
<br>
How do you tell someone something at a minimal cost to yourself
<br>
and guarantee that they receive all of what you are sending them
<br>
(nothing more and nothing less).
<br>
<p>Going back to my comment, you cannot send a &quot;letter/tale/CD&quot;
<br>
at the &quot;speed-of-light&quot; because it requires an infinite amount
<br>
of energy to accelerate it to that speed (this is a consequence
<br>
of the relativity equations).  So you send information as &quot;matter&quot;
<br>
(slowly), or you send information as EM wave (but lose most
<br>
of your investment).  I've got a spreadsheet that does the
<br>
tradeoffs and for the amount of information present in advanced
<br>
civilizations (e.g. MBrains) you would rarely use EM waves as your
<br>
data information carrier across interstellar distances.  Its like
<br>
trying funnel the flow from a fire hose into a hypodermic needle.
