Hal Finney makes two points concerning consciousness in his post
<br>
of yesterday in this thread.  First he (rightly) reiterates that
<br>
playback is to be distinguished from genuine computation, and
<br>
goes on to mention that most philosophers regard machine
<br>
implementation of consciousness to be a very tricky concept itself
<br>
(let alone how to go about it).  However, Hal agrees with Chalmers
<br>
that &quot;a system implements a computation if the causal structure of
<br>
the system mirrors the formal structure of the computation.&quot;
<br>
<p>He then goes on to write
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Note though that this objection does not apply to the huge lookup
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table, as that does represent the full complexity of the abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program.  There may be other reasons to doubt the consciousness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the HLT but this is not one of them.)
</em><br>
<p>But it seems to me that a ridiculously large AI that uses a huge
<br>
pure lookup table is perhaps not truly mirroring the formal structure
<br>
of a computation.  Obviously, this depends on what we mean by the
<br>
&quot;formal structure of a computation&quot;, but in grossest form, making a
<br>
hash of a particular state and using that address to fetch a
<br>
subsequent state doesn't seem to me to be mirroring a tight
<br>
causal computation (of the microcausality type that I wrote
<br>
about earlier today (see below)).
<br>
<p>Hal's second point is that consciousness doesn't have to be
<br>
localized.  Without going to the extremes that Arnold Zuboff
<br>
does (&quot;The Story of a Brain&quot; in The Mind's I), it seems 
<br>
pretty easy to see that.  A functionalist is bound to believe
<br>
that in principle a brain could be the size of galaxy, though
<br>
its thoughts would be slow.  Even all the excitations that
<br>
normally travel from my amygdala to my hippocampus were caused
<br>
to detour through Andromeda, while the rest of my brain waited
<br>
patiently in stasis, in principle I'd never know the difference.
<br>
<p>So I don't really know where he's going with this, unless... he
<br>
had a premonition that someone was going to introduce some sort
<br>
of thing like:
<br>
<p>1.  &quot;Microcausality&quot;:  Subsequent generations on the life
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;board are calculated causally and locally: each glider,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, moves exactly because that glider was in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the previous generation at an exact location.  It has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing to do with, nor is dependent in any way, upon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is happening elsewhere on the life board.  This 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corresponds to a human's neuron pulse moving down an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;axon exactly because it had a certain potential an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instant earlier at, or nearly at, the very same place.
<br>
<p>But here the condition &quot;locally&quot; is only being used to exclude
<br>
non-local influences.  Clearly it also wouldn't matter if each
<br>
glider-gun in each logic calculation on the life board was
<br>
actually halted midway though its electronic dance, and a bunch
<br>
of people in Searle's Chinese room were required to complete some
<br>
generations of the glider-gun by hand.
