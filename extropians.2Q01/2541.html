<p><p><em>&gt; Travas Gunnell wrote a post about sweatshops that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; began:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A sweatshop involves much more than just being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; underpaid.  Sweatshops typically feature several of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the following: threats and intimidation, human rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abuses...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the end of the post, there appeared a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of links, one of which I clicked on by accident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I swear).  And in it beheld...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; C.7.1 What role does class struggle play in the business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cycle?  At its most basic, the class struggle (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resistance to hierarchy in all its forms) is the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cause of the business cycle.  As we argued in section
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; B.1.2 and section C.2, capitalists in order to exploit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a worker must first oppress them. But where there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oppression, there is resistance; where there is authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is the will to freedom. Hence capitalism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; marked by a continuous struggle between worker and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; boss at the point of production as well as struggle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outside of the workplace against other forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hierarchy.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Ah, it makes me nostalgic for the old days.  It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been so long since I savored good old Marxist prose,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;class struggle&quot;, &quot;exploitation&quot;, and &quot;oppression&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yes indeed. And what of those classic debates, e.g., should the
<br>
intelligentsia be spared in the bloody revolution, and if so, how many?
<br>
Really, what happen to the high tradition of rhetoric? In this spirit I
<br>
offer the following as opening statement for the transhumanist manifesto: ;)
<br>
<p><p>A spectre is haunting the world -- the spectre of transhumanism. All the
<br>
powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this
<br>
spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German
<br>
police-spies.
<br>
<p>Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as
<br>
transhumanistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has
<br>
not hurled back the branding reproach of transhumanism, against the more
<br>
advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?
<br>
<p>Two things result from this fact:
<br>
<p>I. Transhumanism is already acknowledged by all the world powers to be
<br>
itself a power.
<br>
<p>II. It is high time that Transhumanism should openly, in the face of the
<br>
whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet
<br>
this nursery tale of the spectre of transhumanism with a manifesto of the
<br>
party itself.
<br>
<p>To this end, Transhumanists of various nationalities have assembled on the
<br>
net and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English,
<br>
French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
