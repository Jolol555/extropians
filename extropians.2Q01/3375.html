I grok that grass is to be walked upon (as MV Smith noted)--and also 
<br>
several definitions of Singularity. We can be prepared, if there's 
<br>
time. Most likely, there won't be. I do think a technoSingularity is 
<br>
inevitable, if we don't derail civilization beforehand. If, however, 
<br>
we can upgrade ourSELVES sufficiently before it arrives, it will not 
<br>
be the &quot;Singularity&quot; we're expecting, and it's conceivable it won't 
<br>
get out of hand. This is what I mean by 'being prepared.' Working the 
<br>
other way around--trying to create a nonhuman SI--is I think 
<br>
(personal opinion) suicidal. Control (including design choices) in 
<br>
such a case--of actions, of intentions, of amicability--is an 
<br>
illusion.
<br>
<p>To my mind, there is only one definition of extinction: You and 
<br>
everything like you is gone.
<br>
<p>I agree &quot;There is no Fate but what we make for ourselves.&quot; Or, as the 
<br>
Greeks had it, &quot;Character is Fate.&quot;
<br>
By either standard, Mankind is in trouble.
