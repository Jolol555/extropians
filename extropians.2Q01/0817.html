<p><em>&gt; In short -- what do you do in the simulation where you get to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you cannot explore any further without 'offing' someone against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their will?
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; Note, there may be a form of &quot;moral&quot; extropianism where you explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the phase space as fully as possible, but you do it with as little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pain &amp; suffering&quot; as possible.   This gets extraordinarily tricky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as for example would be the case where one want to determine whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain &amp; suffering can drive people to self-enlightenment such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they realize pain is something that &quot;they&quot; have and can choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to experience in a variety of ways.
</em><br>
<p>I quick sketch (I'm actually off to a seminar on classical greek
<br>
philosophy which we will apply to transhumanism in a few minutes :-)
<br>
would be that if we just set up extropy as a core value and treat it
<br>
as something fungible, then we might fall into the utilitarian trap of
<br>
trying to maximize it globally with no concern for each individual
<br>
(&quot;If it would make most people happy, then I see nothing wrong with
<br>
turning all professional philosophers into sausages&quot;, as the Swedish
<br>
utilitarian Torbjorn Tannsjo said). 
<br>
<p>But if we accept that extropy has a somewhat diffuse definition that
<br>
involves a certain amount of subjectivity, and/or that it is tied to
<br>
each mind's experience of growth, freedom and complexity, then we get
<br>
somewhere. Maximising extropy cannot be done globally, it is up to
<br>
each being (and group of beings) to try to maximise it. When two
<br>
beings come into conflict over this (say, Robert and I both want
<br>
Jupiter for our respective M-brains) they could of course use force to
<br>
settle it, but if I did this it would lead to the decrease of extropy
<br>
for Robert (however odd I might find his version of extropy) and also
<br>
a significant risk of having the conflict spread (for example by
<br>
involving our friends, allies and PPLs) that would lead to a high
<br>
likeliehood of less extropy even for me (and others). 
<br>
<p>One can develop the above argument into a more watertight ethical
<br>
system, but it seems to point at a situation where extropianism would
<br>
not lead to everybody against everybody trying to get the last scrap
<br>
of computronium, but rather everybody trying to work together to find
<br>
a way out of the box or at least trade the limited resources.
