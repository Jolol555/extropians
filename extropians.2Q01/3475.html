* Tools
<br>
I am not sure the current programming languages have the properties that would
<br>
facilitate building sophisticated AI. Although it might be theoretically
<br>
possible, building an AI with, say, C or Java, resembles building a castle from
<br>
gravel with bare hands. We need the kind of tools that allow programming with
<br>
concepts, influences, contexts, weights, levels-of-detail, causes, structures,
<br>
heuristics, not instructions, predicates, rules or algorithms.
<br>
<p>* Reusability
<br>
An AI is something too complex to be rewritten every few years. It is not just
<br>
the procedures, it's also the knowledge the system has accumulated. This means
<br>
that all the components will have to be reusable to an unprecedented extent. An
<br>
idea is reusable, but its implementation is not.
<br>
<p>* Hierarchy of computation
<br>
An AI is not just a program. It's a system that combines the code, and the
<br>
knowledge about the code. Code alone is not introspective. Knowledge about the
<br>
code is too inefficient to be interpreted. Given a task, the system recompiles
<br>
the important tasks into code that executes quickly. And the code that executes
<br>
especially often to justify the expenditure of time, can be recompiled into
<br>
FPGAs. And every now and then, the system might provide designs for custom chips
<br>
and ask the human guardians for them.
<br>
<p>* Organization
<br>
Building an AI has proven to be something too complicated for a small team of
<br>
people working for a year or two. Perhaps it is better to provide a framework
<br>
that would allow many people to contribute, without breaking the system.
<br>
Deductive thought is just one subsystem, other subsystems are spatial thought,
<br>
classification, clustering, self-analysis, etc.
<br>
<p>* Ecology
<br>
Living in the real world requires perception, and artificial perception is still
<br>
terribly primitive. Until then, it is better to limit the focus of the AI on
<br>
software itself. We do not need proper perception: the objective for Seed AI is
<br>
to rewrite and improve itself, while acting in a simple world (computer), where
<br>
the environment is disk-space ecology, network geography, CPU food, and user the
<br>
God.
<br>
<p>* To Do
<br>
Some things have to be done first. Building the framework is the most complex
<br>
and important item. But we don't yet know how new concepts should emerge, how to
<br>
deal with levels-of-detail, how to estimate the reliability of knowledge, how to
<br>
formally describe ideas, or how to understand and rework software. The problems
<br>
are at a very fundamental level. They're not philosophical, but require a lot of
<br>
introspection, at a relatively mundane level.
<br>
