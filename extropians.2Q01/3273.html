To the apparently few actual Extropians (the capital &quot;E&quot; ones, you know who 
<br>
you are) left on this list, may I suggest we spend the next few weeks doing 
<br>
some serious schooling and &quot;education&quot; of the sizable crop of newbies, 
<br>
trolls, and gibbering incompetents who have made this list almost unusable?
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>As a lower case extropian I would not mind being schooled by the prominent 
<br>
jupiter-minds on the list.  In fact, as I have read the list over the past 
<br>
two years I have been exposed to a vast amount of insights and concepts 
<br>
which I might never have known otherwise.
<br>
<p>Brian listed my subject line:
<br>
Re: Spike, the head throb!
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>As Z would say, &quot;Yeouch(I have seen the film Antz about 100 times with my 
<br>
roommate's three year-old)!&quot; Actually, the title was, &quot;Spike, the heart 
<br>
throb!&quot; and not &quot;head throb!&quot;  I would hope Spike doesn't induce headaches 
<br>
in people...  It wasn't an outstanding subject line but I was simply trying 
<br>
to applaud Spike for keeping the romance alive in his marriage.
<br>
<p>The subject line which made me really wince was the unforgettable &quot;joy or 
<br>
rape&quot; someone unthinkingly dared to post...

When an issue arises that has been previously discussed, the
<br>
poster is referred to the list archives; we may have only a fourth as many 
<br>
messages as Extropians, but the messages are *all* new and unexplored 
<br>
territory. In short, it's a lot like the Extropians list circa 1996, 
<br>
although higher-quality and lower-volume.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I bet in 1996 people were saying how they missed the &quot;good old days&quot; of 1993 
<br>
when the list was really worth reading!  In fact, I have in perusing the 
<br>
archives found quotes like that.  Oneday, you will look back fondly on the 
<br>
2001 list as compared to 2004.

<br>
Let me see if I have this straight: You're one of the main guys
<br>
endeavoring to create a friendly--pardon me, Friendly--AI, right?
<br>
God help us.  I hope it's friendlier than you.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Try to look at it from Brian's perspective. He is the Extropian's Extropian. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean by that is this... remember the taunt people throw at 
<br>
extropians which goes like this, &quot;if you're so smart why aren't you rich?&quot;  
<br>
Well, Brian is a rather wealthy self-made Extropian who has met the 
<br>
challenge.  He is our new new economy ecommerce champion who has among his 
<br>
successes won the love of an intelligent and beautiful woman he met here!
<br>
<p>And so being in a position of power and some prestige he wants the Extropian 
<br>
Institute to progress and move on to the next level.  But, when in his view 
<br>
people on the list act as stumbling blocks he gets frustrated.  We all have 
<br>
to work with the man to go forward.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
