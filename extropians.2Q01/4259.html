<em>&gt;I guess I am an extropian, but I think I am much more pessimistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than most as of the you people on the list seem to be as for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the timing for the Singularity, or the transition to posthumanism.
</em><br>
<p>There are several skeptics about immanent Singularity on this list,
<br>
including myself.  Of those who discuss the immanence of the 
<br>
Singularity, a majority think it is; but I note many people don't
<br>
get involved in such discussions. 
<br>
<p>I'm curious whether anybody on this list takes actions that would be
<br>
irrational or unusual under the general assumption of no immanent
<br>
Singularity.  For example, taking a 125% mortgage on your house
<br>
(since you may not need to pay it) or refusing professional education
<br>
intended primarily for financial gain.
