<p>If you want to do neuroscience, you might discover that *everybody* 
<br>
*everywhere* is too stupid to understand that. So your choices are 
<br>
suddenly reduced to: 1) looking for some other area to work in
<br>
2) getting a degree after all, dammit 
<br>
3) find sponsors (who also are usually also stupid enough to look 
<br>
for a degree and accomplishment track before commiting their
<br>
investments) and whip up a research center all by yourself.

People who can't walk on air or don't come from a serious money background

usually tend to choose the path of least resistance and choose 2)

<p>If you're really smart, you can score high enough in the tests to

be able to attend the best institutions of the world, and work with

leading practiticioners in the field. There's no way you can do that

on your own. The equipment and the noncommited knowledge are simply
<br>
not to be found elsewhere.
