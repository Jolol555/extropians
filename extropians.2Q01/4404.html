<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 39'th update of my fly longevity experiments. In order 
<br>
to complete these updates on a timely basis, many runs are in progress
<br>
simultaneously. For example this run was started two months after Run #36
<br>
was initiated. At that time the highest survival was with flies fed
<br>
Knudsen black cherry juice, and this stimulated the present investigation
<br>
into cherry juices. However one limitation of these experiments is that
<br>
the flies used are a random assortment from the same breeding bottle. They
<br>
are therefore not all of the same age, and average survival is a rather
<br>
chancy affair. By comparison, as long as a few young flies wind up in each
<br>
bottle in a run, then maximum lifespan will tend to be roughly the same in
<br>
many bottles. It is this later figure that is my primary
<br>
interest. Unfortunately maximum lifespan in Run #36 subsequently proved to
<br>
be undistinguished for black cherry juice.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present run further indicates that if anything, cherry juices are
<br>
toxic, rather than beneficial. Cherry juices are a source of cyanide,
<br>
which may account for these diverse results. The next run will have more
<br>
interesting results.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Freezer Runs #11 &amp; #12, I used some thicker plastic bags to store
<br>
the flies for 4 days. Apparently the lack of air permeating this plastic
<br>
proved to be lethal, with 100% mortality in some cases. No supplement
<br>
offered significant protection against freezing damage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since no supplement yet tested has been consistently successful in
<br>
reducing freezing induced mortality, I have decided to discontinue this
<br>
line of inquiry. Instead an alternative additional type of experiment will
<br>
be reported on in my next fly longevity update. This will be a personal
<br>
investigation of a food satiety index.
