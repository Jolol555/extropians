Ooohboy. Africa. In a nutshell, here's the problem: It's always been 
<br>
a mess, it continues to be a mess, and it probably always will be a 
<br>
mess. Yes it seems like the humanitarian thing to do, to bring food 
<br>
to the starving masses--and I do not argue against this. Who could? 
<br>
But here is what happens--this causes the population to grow rapidly, 
<br>
producing a far larger crisis which must be solved with far more 
<br>
food, and so on ad infinitum. Eventually, by saving the first buch 
<br>
you have rather directly caused the eventual and seemingly inevitable 
<br>
death-by-starvation of a far, far larger number of people.
<br>
<p>You hand them the tech to provide for themselves, they won't. They're 
<br>
too busy being oppressed by their own or other governments and 
<br>
slaughtered by warlords or neighbors.
<br>
<p>The majority of the continent is a total write-off. Eventually 
<br>
they'll eat the wildlife or destroy its food/water sources.
<br>
<p>Kenya has it halfway together half of the time. A few of the northern 
<br>
nations. The rest? Pfff.
<br>
<p>We think we have problems? We have inconveniences. Just to be born 
<br>
here (US) with all your marbles to decent parents is 99.999999% of 
<br>
everything you could want, when you think about it.
<br>
<p>Don't believe it?
<br>
Tour Eritrea.

<em>&gt; Harvest of Fear, yes, that was an excellent and surprisingly

<em>&gt; The anti-GMers argue that giving the rural Africans GM will

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is the alternative?  If the west gives food to the underfed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Africans, it still has an enormous cost by the time it gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its intended recipients, for the transportation costs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormous.  Rural Africa lacks the transportation infrastructure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as trucks, which would be useless anyway for they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack adequate roads.  Often supples must be hauled in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wheelbarrows by hand.  This in addition to the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rural African farmers have their pride, and are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beggars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the Greenpeacers withhold GM from the Africans, they simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow them to starve.  Since starvation is a particularly cruel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of death, the Greenpeacers would show tender mercy
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Peacers would change their minds when the Africans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; began to shoot back?  Perhaps Greenpeace would donate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds to build highways into the jungles and Diesel trucks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haul food?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't the answers to these vexing problems either, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ELF/EarthFirst/GreenPeace position seems hopelessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mired in contradictions, unless they come right out and
