<p>The issues of (largely electrolytic) hydrid and atomic hydrogen
<br>
embrittlement and high-pressure/high-temperature typically do not occur
<br>
together. The steel embrittlement was an early plague of the Haber Bosch
<br>
process, which occurs at 500 atm and 450 deg C. Now these are not the
<br>
typical conditions under which a pipeline is operated, especially
<br>
considering the temperature.

<p><em>&gt; The problem of letting humans sense H2 leaks is a thorny one, if the

<p>Methane high-temp cells with nickel electrodes are pretty much immune to
<br>
poisoning.
<br>
<p>In any case, one would want to generate the hydrogen locally, either from
<br>
methane, using existing natural gas infrastructure, or from water via
<br>
electrolysis or photolysis, which renders above arguments nilpotent.
