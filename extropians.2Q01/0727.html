</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The question of what level of consciousness deserves consideration

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that is what he is saying, then I would disagree completely
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a critical distinction between a basement level &quot;real&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-conscious entity and one that is running on a simulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort.
</em><br>
<p>Let me briefly give an explicit argument for why simulated beings deserve
<br>
the same consideration as real ones.  Basically I will claim that there
<br>
is no fundamental difference between a simulated and a real being.
<br>
I know this is a radical claim but see if the chain of reasoning below
<br>
is convincing.
<br>
<p>Real human beings have all of their consciousness tied up in their brain.
<br>
The activity of the brain somehow produces the consciousness that makes
<br>
us want to care about them morally.  We know the brain works by the
<br>
activity of neural cells which interact with each other via chemical
<br>
and electrical messages.  Likewise they get information from and send
<br>
signals to the outside world via similar messages.
<br>
<p>Now imagine a brain with the neurons replaced by artificial electrical
<br>
components which have the same functional effect.  Each neuron has been
<br>
turned into an electrical equivalent.  The brain continues to run the same
<br>
way, and it still is able to receive sensory input from the outside world
<br>
(the sensory neurons will be replaced with electrical transducers).
<br>
Is the person now a simulation?  I would say no, he is still real.
<br>
The fact that his neurons are made of metal instead of protein is not
<br>
of fundamental importance.
<br>
<p>Now imagine the brain replaced by a computer sitting in the head,
<br>
performing exactly the same calculations that the artificial neurons did.
<br>
It still has connections to the I/O transducers which communicate with
<br>
the outside world.  Is the person now a simulation?  I would still say
<br>
no, he is real, because all we have done is rearrange the electrical
<br>
circuits inside his head.  This cannot change his level of reality.
<br>
<p>Now imagine the computer is not located in the head, but in a console
<br>
somewhere.  Maybe the body is still teleoperated by the computer, or maybe
<br>
it is a simulated body running in VR.  Is the person a simulation yet?
<br>
Again, I would say no.  If the I/O is still attached to a real body,
<br>
all we have done is move the computer, and that can't change his level
<br>
of reality.  If the I/O is virtual, we can reverse the steps and get
<br>
back to a biological brain which is interacting in VR.  If we agree that
<br>
a biological brain interacting in VR is &quot;real&quot;, then a computer brain
<br>
interacting in VR is real too.
<br>
<p>The result of this chain of reasoning is that the distinction between
<br>
&quot;levels of reality&quot; is not correct.  &quot;Simulated&quot; people are just as real
<br>
as physical ones.
<br>
<p>I think this is what Nick had in mind.  He emphasized that a conscious
<br>
brain is a *physical* object.  This is true whether it is a bunch
<br>
of neurons, an electrical circuit, or an appropriately programmed
<br>
computer.  When someone is thinking, in a brain or a simulation or a
<br>
sim-within-a-sim, there is physical activity in the real world that
<br>
implements that thought.  The thoughts are real, regardless of the
<br>
context in which they appear.
