<p>Hmmmm.  Ok, so you are not supposed to &quot;kill&quot; people.  However
<br>
we have the Apollo fire and the shuttle disaster, the Russians
<br>
have their equally messy examples.  Exploring is risky and risks
<br>
kill.  Simple.  Now, presumably you have some value for &quot;life&quot;
<br>
because almost all countries are paying individuals to put their
<br>
lives at risk (this is what the military is all about).
<br>
<p>We also have private companies who pay individuals to put their
<br>
lives at risk.  The people who do oil-platform diving or those
<br>
who extinguish oil-well fires or even firemen and policemen
<br>
come to mind.
<br>
<p>So one has to ask -- is the potential loss of life involved
<br>
in the exploration of space &quot;overpriced&quot;?
<br>
<p>There should be a really good academic paper involved in the
<br>
exploration of this question.  We all know that preserving
<br>
lives has costs.  The question is whether NASA has gone off
<br>
the deep end?
<br>
<p>I for one suspect that there are people who would sign up
<br>
to be Astronauts if the profession were 10x, 100x, perhaps
<br>
even 1000x riskier.  The question is what each level of
<br>
additional safety is costing us?
