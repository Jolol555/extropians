<p>Why do you care if they get nicer? They'll burn themselves out in a few
<br>
millennia at the most, since they'll likely refuse life-extension tech
<br>
and will be unable to keep their memes intact over such a long time period.
<br>
At that point, by definition, the only survivors left around in the universe
<br>
will be the ones who survived (i.e. the more rational/flexible beings). I
<br>
think that religious fanatacism is not a memeset with long-term survivability
<br>
in a very high tech world. Evolution sucks if you're the loser.
<br>
<p>What you have to watch out for is making sure that they don't take you
<br>
with them on their doomed quest. That's what a Sysop is for. And that's
<br>
why adding a SI into the mix gets rid of this little issue. They can't
<br>
do much if their weapons won't fire on the people who don't want to die.
