<p>
It hasn't had much (if any) national news coverage yet, but OSU is
<br>
experiencing an animal rights controversy.  The only real coverage I could
<br>
find was from our school newspaper, so please excuse the quality:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thelantern.com/main.cfm?include=detail&storyid=50530">http://www.thelantern.com/main.cfm?include=detail&storyid=50530</a>&amp;
<br>
<a href="http://www.thelantern.com/main.cfm?include=detail&storyid=51175">http://www.thelantern.com/main.cfm?include=detail&storyid=51175</a>&amp;
<br>
<p><p>The gist of it is that Dr. Michael Podell
<br>
(<a href="http://www.vet.ohio-state.edu/docs/biosci/podell.html">http://www.vet.ohio-state.edu/docs/biosci/podell.html</a>), whom I have met,
<br>
and attended a lecture by him, is doing research on the effect of
<br>
methamphetamines and drug abuse.  He is using cats for this research, and
<br>
therefore has triggered a public relations nightmare with the animal rights
<br>
people.  He has received threats, and his research building was vandalized.
<br>
<p>I have taken this opportunity to get to know the AR folks  (some of which
<br>
are represented here:  <a href="http://home.att.net/~PoetWill/kitty.htm">http://home.att.net/~PoetWill/kitty.htm</a>.  I just
<br>
talked to one of them, who is part of a hunger strike (120 hours for 120
<br>
cats).  I am going to attend some of their meetings, though she warned me
<br>
that a university professor had been banished for &quot;offending people.&quot;  I
<br>
would also like to be a voice of reason in this debate.
<br>
<p>There is a further complication:  The university is very tight-lipped about
<br>
this whole business, not allowing anything to be said in defense of the
<br>
research by a university official.
<br>
<p>That said, two things:
<br>
<p>1.  Some of you (Greg Burch in particular, I think) have experience with the
<br>
many forms of luddites.  How should I proceed?  I was able to make minor
<br>
points with the girl I spoke to today (it didn't hurt that I was my usual
<br>
charming self).  She used terms like &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;vivisection&quot;
<br>
(apparently, *all* animal research is vivisection) to describe the research,
<br>
and I tried to make her see how that inhibits communication.  I also made
<br>
the point that I, too, feel that the pain and suffering of animals should be
<br>
reduced.  She even said that I &quot;sound like a nice guy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Our main problems came down to opinions on ethics.  She thinks that it is
<br>
unethical to do research on animals.  I don't.  I tried to defend my view on
<br>
this, but my main support, that not preserving intelligence ensures that all
<br>
life will eventually die, and that is nihilistic, would not go over well.
<br>
How does one communicate, if at all, with these people?  My dad is a real
<br>
estate developer (home builder), and an officer of the Ohio branch of the
<br>
National Home Builder's Association.  He and a fellow officer joined an
<br>
anti-development group, and have been able to tone it down to a &quot;responsible
<br>
development&quot; standpoint, from which they can work together.  I am
<br>
considering trying this with the animal rights group, but it may be
<br>
impossible in this case. Also, what arguments can I make to fence-sitters?
<br>
I also talk to many people who have been partially swayed by the AR nuts'
<br>
viewpoint.
<br>
<p>2.  I may have, or be able to obtain, information that the university does
<br>
not want out, at least from official mouthpieces.  Should I take a risk and
<br>
use these in an article I will write for the school paper?
<br>
<p>Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer me.  In any case, I will be
<br>
in the trenches shortly, fighting the Extropian fight.
<br>
<p>Josh
