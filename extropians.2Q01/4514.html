<p>
Extropians, I went downtown San Jose last Sunday to
<br>
check out restaurants for E5.  Looks like we have 59
<br>
choices within walking distance, but I picked out 16
<br>
that look really good.  I figure we can split up into
<br>
amoebae of 8 to 12 extropians per amoeba, then
<br>
ooze over and engulf our food.  The Hilton has a
<br>
detailed restaurant map that shows all the things
<br>
mentioned in this epistle.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that the Towers are right in the middle
<br>
of the high rent district, so the places that are really
<br>
close tend to be upscale, but if you are willing to walk
<br>
a few hundred meters north and east over towards the
<br>
university district, there is plenty of reasonable choices.
<br>
Some of the places are closed on Sunday.  I would not
<br>
blame anyone if they carry a lunchbox to keep
<br>
options open, hang out at the hotel.  If you do go
<br>
onto the campus there are plenty of eateries, over
<br>
in the Student Association Center, etc.
<br>
<p>Restaurants.  Here are spike’s picks, listed in approximate
<br>
order of closeness to the Towers.
<br>
<p>1.  The City Bar and Grill.  This is the restaurant right
<br>
on the ground floor of the Hilton Towers.  The place
<br>
looked good, unfortunately I did not get to look at the
<br>
menu. I was wearing my motorcycle costume,
<br>
consequently the maitre’d had a look of growing
<br>
concern as I approached.  I veered away, much to
<br>
his relief.  I cannot say I blame him, for any restaurant
<br>
that would serve me the way I looked, Im not sure
<br>
I would want to eat there.
<br>
<p>2.  Miro’s in the Crowne Plaza, across the street
<br>
from the Towers to the North.  They have a nice
<br>
mural of the Silicon Valley from back when it was
<br>
still carbon valley.  Food looks good, perhaps a
<br>
little fancy schmancy for my taste, cloth napkins
<br>
and such, but a good choice for those who do not
<br>
like to walk or those whose schedule is tight.
<br>
<p>3.  Cafe Primavera, 303 Almaden Blvd, right
<br>
across the street from the Towers to the West.
<br>
Italian, on the trendy spendy side.
<br>
<p>4.  Scotts Seafood, 185 Park Ave, about 200
<br>
meters north of the Towers.  Ive eaten there,
<br>
really good food but prices are high and I think
<br>
you need reservations.  971-1700.
<br>
<p>5.  The Agenda.  Ive been here a couple times
<br>
and this one is waaay over on the spendy side,
<br>
gourmet dishes, endangered species flambe and
<br>
such, however they have bands in there on
<br>
Saturday nights.  That one is just one street
<br>
west of the convention center.  The Hilton is
<br>
adjacent to the towers.  399 S. First Street.
<br>
<p>6.  Kukar’s House of Pizza.  About 300 meters
<br>
south of the Towers, 527 Almaden Blvd.
<br>
<p>7.  Eulipia.  Gourmet, spendy.  Ate there once
<br>
for a retirement party.  374 S. First.
<br>
<p>8.  Original Joe’s.  Lots of choices on the menu,
<br>
looks good, prices reasonable.  301 S First street.
<br>
Between the Agenda and Joe’s there are three
<br>
other places that might be acceptable, and all
<br>
these are close to the Towers, 300 meters or so.
<br>
<p>9.  Grill on the Alley, in the Fairmont Hotel.
<br>
More highly competent cooking, still on the fancy
<br>
side.
<br>
<p>10.  Museum Cafe, in the San Jose Museum of Art.
<br>
<p>11.  Subway!  You know what you’re getting,
<br>
good price, vegetarian stuff available, fast.  Thats
<br>
a couple blocks north of the Towers, 164 W. San
<br>
Fernando.
<br>
<p>12.  Fuji’s Sushi.  Never eaten there but looks
<br>
good.  156 San Fernando.
<br>
<p>13.  Johnny Rocket’s! good burgers, reasonable
<br>
prices, 150 S. First.
<br>
<p>14.  Hawg’s Seafood Bar.  150 S. Second.
<br>
Looks good, haven’t eaten there.
<br>
<p>15.  Tied House!  Excellent burgers, reasonable
<br>
prices, casual atmosphere, can handle bigger
<br>
amoebae of 15 to 20.  Microbrewery.  Actually
<br>
it would be way cool if they had a nanobrewery:
<br>
they would put powdered hops in your glass,
<br>
add water, stir.  Lots of good food at the Tied House,
<br>
and there is a cluster of places right next to it on
<br>
either side, so a bunch of us might want to wander
<br>
up that way.  Its about 600 meters north of the
<br>
Hilton Towers.  65 N. San Pedro.
<br>
<p>16.  Spaghetti Factory.  Good food, reasonable
<br>
prices, can handle big groups.  Might be crowded.
<br>
Right next to the Tied House on San Pedro.
<br>
<p>There are also some steak houses and such up
<br>
that way next to the Tied House, and a vegetarian
<br>
restaurant across the street, Thepthai’s, where I
<br>
understand they serve plants.  23 N Market, and
<br>
some other choices along Market Street.
<br>
We shall not go hungry.
<br>
<p>Things to see while looking for sustenance:  Cesar Chavez
<br>
Plaza is a little park just north and east of the towers.
<br>
Check out the sculpture of the snake at the south end
<br>
of the park.  The City of San Jose paid a million dollars
<br>
for this abomination.  Tax dollars hard at work.  Cesar
<br>
Chavez I understand was some Union leader or something.
<br>
I guess he served alongside General Grant.  Sometimes
<br>
street vendors hang around the Park, where one can
<br>
score a dog and cola, or perhaps a hot soft pretzel.
<br>
<p>At the north end of that park is the San Jose Museum
<br>
of Art.  Inside one finds paintings and sculptures and
<br>
such.  Too bad they don’t take the snake, and place
<br>
it somewhere where I need not look at it.  Right beside
<br>
the Art Museum is St. Joseph’s Cathedral.  They are
<br>
tolerant of atheists, so look in there if you get a chance,
<br>
just to see what they have done with stained glass.
<br>
They’ve made windows out of it.
<br>
<p>Across the way, you might see the Knight-Ridder
<br>
building where they produce the local communist
<br>
propaganda sheet, thinly disguised as the San Jose
<br>
Mercury News.  In those pages you will likely find
<br>
whining that George Bush is unwilling to drain the
<br>
national treasury to buy power for Taxifornia.
<br>
<p>The Tech museum down the street from the Towers.
<br>
A little on the juvenile side, but they have an IMAX,
<br>
and you need not pay for museum admission to see it.
<br>
You may see a cable car on San Carlos Street, San
<br>
Jose’s lame attempt to be San Francisco.  They
<br>
don’t do the bell thing.
<br>
<p>This is gonna be fuuuuuun!  {8-]  spike
