A while back I mentioned that in order to give meaningful answers to
<br>
anti-tech propaganda, one must understand its valid points. Below is an
<br>
article addressing one of the valid anti-tech points. Generally held beliefs
<br>
(eg. that &quot;the world&quot; would starve without the use of toxic pesticides and
<br>
that one must expend a huge amount labor--human or machine--to grow one's
<br>
food) are wrong. To say that agricultural efficiency doesn't matter one way
<br>
or the other because some day we'll have nanotechnology or inorganic bodies
<br>
is not (IMO) a meaningful response.
<br>
<p>The research described below was done with apple trees.
<br>
<p>FWIW, some of my easiest food crops are fruiting trees and vines: peaches,
<br>
figs, persimmons, blueberries, pears, plums, mulberries and blackberries (I
<br>
grow other fruits as well, such as citrus, but these require more care, not
<br>
being ideally suited to this climate). The trees and vines are presently
<br>
loaded with fruit, some of which is ripe now. The remainder will ripen over
<br>
the next few months. Aside from planting the domesticated trees and watering
<br>
them during the first year while they were getting their roots established,
<br>
and now and then throwing on some mulch and compost, the only work I have to
<br>
do is to pick the fruit. The compost is made from our garbage--all we do is
<br>
toss it on the pile; the bacteria and other critters do all the work of
<br>
converting it. The fruit requires no cooking or other elaborate preparation,
<br>
though sometimes for fun I use it in pie or sorbet. Picking the fruit and
<br>
eating it straight from the tree are far less bother than going to a grocery
<br>
store or restaurant. Here are a few photos to illustrate what I'm talking
<br>
about. With the exception of the strawberries, none of these crops required
<br>
any work at all from me other than once-annual mulching after the first year
<br>
(the wild stuff, ofcourse, required no work whatever).
<br>

<br>
<p>It's true that not everyone has access to enough land to grow fruit trees.
<br>
However, even with presently available varieties of food plants, it's
<br>
possible to feed a person from an amazingly small volume of space. With the
<br>
right kind of genetic engineering this volume could be further decreased,
<br>
and more crops could be designed to produce food that's palatable and
<br>
nutritious without cooking or other preparation (this last is the problem I
<br>
see with growing yeast-type food crops--they taste horrible unless they're
<br>
processed, which requires work and space. Genetic engineering could likely
<br>
remedy this problem). I can imagine a food-factory/garbage conversion unit
<br>
(of volume, say, 10 ft. cubed) being a standard feature for all apartments
<br>
and houses. In addition to providing food in exchange for very little
<br>
effort, the food factory could be visually attractive. (note that I'm using
<br>
the term &quot;garbage&quot; to include solid and liquid waste products from human
<br>
metabolism). This idea seems very strange to most people who are used to
<br>
buying food, whereas the idea of flushing excrement and toxic chemicals into
<br>
the drinking water seems perrfectly fine. But if you step outside the
<br>
culture and look at the situation objectively, many of the present uses of
<br>
technology are quite illogical if one's goal is to live well for a long
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Anyhow, here's a news report of research described in the current issue of
<br>
*Nature*.

<p>Organic Farming Can Be Profitable
<br>
<p>By WILLIAM McCALL
<br>
Associated Press Writer
<br>
<p>Organic farming could be healthy for profits as well as the soil, according
<br>
to a new six-year study of apple orchards.
<br>
<p>Concerns about pesticides leaching into drinking water have opened a debate
<br>
over organic farming techniques, which instead of chemicals use natural
<br>
fertilizers and biological pest controls.
<br>
<p>Washington State University researcher John Reganold, who conducted the
<br>
study of apple growing techniques, suggests that organic farming, at least
<br>
in apple production, can raise profits, improve soil quality and produce
<br>
sweeter, firmer fruit than conventional practices.
<br>
<p>``The health of the trees, apples, soil, fungi, earthworms, how well clods
<br>
hold together - we looked at everything,'' Reganold said.
<br>
<p>The study is in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
<br>
<p>The researchers divided an apple orchard into plots that used organic
<br>
methods, conventional techniques or a mix of both, called integrated
<br>
management.
<br>
<p>The convention plot was treated with chemical pesticides and fertilizers
<br>
while the organic system used compost, manures, and biological pest
<br>
controls. Weeds were controlled in the organic plot with cover crops,
<br>
mulching and mechanical methods, including burning.
<br>
<p>Each test orchard at the site near the central Washington town of Zillah was
<br>
measured for impacts on soil quality, fruit quality, profitability,
<br>
environmental quality and energy efficiency.
<br>
<p>``The bottom line is that organic outperforms the others,'' Reganold said.
<br>
<p>The study indicated the organic orchard would break even on operating cost
<br>
nine years after planting, compared to 15 years using conventional methods
<br>
and 16 years for integrated management.
<br>
<p>Soil quality ratings were much higher for organic and integrated systems,
<br>
largely due to the addition of compost and mulch, Reganold said.
<br>
<p>``We were adding compost and chicken manure to the organic and integrated
<br>
plots, so it's not rocket science,'' he said. ``But it turns out that
<br>
organic matter improves almost everything about the soil.''
<br>
<p>Reganold's study adds to a small but growing body of evidence that organic
<br>
farming methods can boost agricultural output while reducing damage to the
<br>
environment, said Fred Kirschenmann, director of the Leopold Center for
<br>
Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University.
<br>
<p>``To me, it's not a big surprise,'' Kirschenmann said. ``It's being
<br>
corroborated in other parts of the world.''
<br>
<p>Bill Wilcke, acting administrator of the Minnesota Institute for Sustainable
<br>
Agriculture, said the research shows the need to study other crops to see if
<br>
organic farming can be applied on a larger scale.
<br>
<p>Different crops have different problems, he said. Wheat farmers, for
<br>
example, must till their soil more frequently if they choose organic pest
<br>
control over conventional spraying, and that raises concerns about soil
<br>
erosion.
<br>
<p>``They've done a good job of demonstrating they were able to get better
<br>
environmental benefits and better yields and fruit quality,'' Wilcke said.
<br>
<p>Bob Stebbins, who heads an association of Oregon orchard growers, said the
<br>
study may be too specific to draw general conclusions about organic farming.
<br>
<p>Eastern Washington is especially good for apple orchards because the climate
<br>
is dry, eliminating many apple pests and plant diseases, and there is plenty
<br>
of Columbia River irrigation water to keep soil fertile.
<br>
<p>``It shows you can grow organic apples very well in eastern Washington,''
<br>
Stebbins said. ``It may not apply to other places.''
