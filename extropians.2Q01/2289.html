<p>Isn't the idea that a government can put you in prison for 
<br>
life, deny you any chance to pursue a career, or marry, or
<br>
travel, or even have children equally disturbing to you?
<br>
<p>You perhaps may want to bring about a situation where 
<br>
person A can in fact kill person B, but no government 
<br>
can kill person A regardless of what he has done.
<br>
<p>Also, isn't it better to let ten thousand guilty men
<br>
go free rather than deprive an innocent man of his
<br>
livelihood, his freedom, and his family?  (Never mind
<br>
what the ten thousand guilty men may do; apparently
<br>
what's important is that our own  hands, i.e., our
<br>
government's hands, remain clean.)
