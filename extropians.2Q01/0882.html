I guess we might
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;imagine that they were putting the programmer on trial. It's pretty clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that if there is a Programmer for our universe, he's a real f---ing
</em><br>
bastard.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not so sure. We are seeing things from a very limited perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Point taken. If I believed in a creator and if I believe He was morally
<br>
perfect then I too would take the transcendental defence
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If this is a simulation do you think we have grounds to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sue?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ethical problems here are quite closely related to the classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theological problem of evil and I suppose no easier to resolve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Indeed, you've mentioned a couple already.
<br>
a) deny that evil exists: In an earlier post you imagined that evil might be
<br>
more apparent than real.
<br>
b) the transcendental defence: As you say &quot;We are seeing things from a very
<br>
limited perspective&quot; i.e., the programmer works in mysterious ways. The
<br>
programmer's purposes are inscrutable.
<br>
c) the free will defence: (Augustine) the programmer gave us free will and
<br>
so the choice to do evil. If the programmer interfered then our will would
<br>
not be free.
<br>
d) the Irenean defence: the programmer made us primitive so we would go up
<br>
the learning curve and become more ethical.
<br>
e) The fall defence: evil is our own fault from our defective natures. Our
<br>
defective natures are a result of our fall from grace with the programmer.
<br>
(perhaps Adam and Eve discovered that this is a sim--that's the forbidden
<br>
fruit).
<br>
Of course the big difference here is that theodicies are predicated on the
<br>
assumption that God is morally perfect. There is no independent reason to
<br>
suppose that the programmer is morally perfect and some good countervailing
<br>
evidence, viz., our world.
