<p>Don't get me wrong.  I would have no objection to upgrading
<br>
myself piecemeal into a transhuman.  Starting with mobile
<br>
high-speed Internet access.  Retinal projectors.  Some sort
<br>
of myoelectric pickup that would allow me to type by twitching
<br>
my fingers.  And on to the more exotic stuff (whatever it turns
<br>
out to be).  All that would be right up my alley.  It would be
<br>
part of my entertainment budget.  Chocolate **is** good!
<br>
<p>If I could take the Krell brain-boost in the form of an extra
<br>
vitamin pill in the morning, my credit card would be on the
<br>
counter at GNC in a flash.  Not that one would have much of a
<br>
choice about it if such stuff really became available -- you'd
<br>
have to do it to stay employed, or even to continue to be
<br>
able to hang out with your friends, if they decided to take
<br>
the pills.  But I wouldn't fight it; I'd be eager to try it.
<br>
<p>If, after a few decades of this, I ended up looking back on my
<br>
merely human existence the way I look back on being a five-year-old
<br>
now, I wouldn't get particularly bent out of shape about it.
<br>
<p>There's something about cryo that puts me off, though -- I suppose
<br>
it's not entirely rational, but it's quite strong.  If someone
<br>
I cared about insisted I do it, I suppose I'd do it -- with a great
<br>
deal of eye-rolling, foot-dragging, and face-making (I'd have to
<br>
be pushed through the door of the office, and I **really** wouldn't
<br>
be able to look the salesman in the eye).
<br>
<p>I feel the same way (or even more so) about being scanned and
<br>
duplicated as an upload, a la _Permutation City_.  I don't feel
<br>
like the Copy would be me, just somebody with all my faults and
<br>
limitations.
<br>
<p>I really don't know whether I'd push the button to initiate a
<br>
Moravec transfer.  I suppose I probably would, in the end -- but
<br>
I'd dance around it for a long time, and I'd want to see a lot
<br>
of TV documentaries and Usenet articles, as well as talking
<br>
to a few uploads, first.
<br>
<p>Of course, having my brain supercharged, if that becomes
<br>
possible, might cause me to change my mind about anything in
<br>
the above three paragraphs!
