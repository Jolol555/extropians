November 11, 1993
<br>
Dr. Avi Ben-Abraham, president of the American Cryogenics Society, told
<br>
an audience in Washington, D.C., that several high-ranking Roman
<br>
Catholic Church leaders support human embryo cloning, despite the
<br>
Church's public stance against such research. According to Ben-Abraham,
<br>
those Church leaders hope to reproduce Jesus Christ from DNA fibers
<br>
found on the Shroud of Turin.
<br>
<p>Friday, 17 February 1989
<br>
The Morton Downey show will concern itself with Cryonics. The main guest
<br>
will be Dr. Avi Ben-Abraham, a &quot;certified genius&quot; (whatever that means)
<br>
who was the youngest surgeon ever to perform open-heart surgery (at the
<br>
age of 16) and who has been nominated for a Nobel Prize (in medicine, I
<br>
assume). He is also Director of the American Cryonics Society.
<br>
Nanotechnology will be mentioned in defense of the technical feasibility
<br>
of cryonics. I assume that the academic level of the discussion will not
<br>
average highly. Still, it will be one of the first &quot;mass media&quot;
<br>
presentations where nanotechnology is even mentioned.
