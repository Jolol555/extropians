Self-scaling robots edge nearer
<br>
<a href="http://www.e4engineering.com/item.asp?id=38249&amp;type=news&amp;ch=&amp;pub">http://www.e4engineering.com/item.asp?id=38249&amp;type=news&amp;ch=&amp;pub</a>=
<br>
They can be a bane to a temperamental youth but they could also make robots
<br>
bigger, stronger and more independent. What are they? Hormones, and a team at
<br>
the University of Southern California's Information Science Institute have
<br>
included hormone-like messaging in a robotic control system.
<br>
The discovery could lead to significant advances in self-scaling robots -
<br>
robots that can rebuild themselves. Robots with this ability could explore
<br>
deep space independently: shipped to distant planets as a mass of tiny dumb
<br>
units, they would build themselves into whatever kind of machinery proved
<br>
appropriate on arrival.
<br>
Behnam Salemi and his colleagues at the ISI have found a way to make such
<br>
resourceful robots. These include walking creations that will adapt their gait
<br>
if they lose a leg, and others that inch along like a caterpillar regardless
<br>
of what length they have become. Both use software inspired by biological
<br>
hormones.
<br>
In nature, hormones trigger events in different parts of the body
<br>
simultaneously. 'For example, when a human experiences sudden fear, a hormone
<br>
is released by the brain, causing different actions,' said Salemi. Fear
<br>
releases hormones that might make your mouth open and your leg muscles twitch
<br>
into action. Although the brain triggers the hormone, the muscle control is
<br>
located in the mouth and legs, Salemi said.
<br>
'Hormones are propagated signals that can be modified or delayed-or which can
<br>
even disappear along the way,' said project supervisor Peter Will. This
<br>
adaptability lets hormones accomplish tasks that a single-destination message
<br>
could not.
<br>
In a segmented or multi-module robot, a message based on digital hormones will
<br>
reach all connected sections. The hormone message tells all modules about the
<br>
condition of the others without carrying specific commands. Each module can
<br>
then interpret this knowledge in its own way.
<br>
Each module is an autonomous unit, with its own on-board power supply and
<br>
motors. The modules connect via two-pronged plugs through which the hormones
<br>
propagate. 'You don't even give it information about what gait it should
<br>
adopt,' said Salemi. The human 'operator' just tells the robot which direction
<br>
to move and the robot will figure out the best gait, given its current
<br>
configuration.
