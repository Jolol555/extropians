<p>Do you really think so? When the SI parts the Red Sea, feeds the worlds 
<br>
hungry, demonstrates that it can give total bliss and explain everything, 
<br>
they will just say: &quot;So what? You are note a real god, since you were created 
<br>
by humans. *God* is beyond the universe and far, far beyond what you are. In 
<br>
fact, He even predicted you - read Revelations about the Antichrist!&quot;
<br>
<p>You make the mistake to apply our way of thinking (highly empirical, 
<br>
rationalist) to people who do not think that way (religious fanatics). Sure, 
<br>
plenty of them will fall to the lure of the SI, but given what we know of 
<br>
human nature the SI would likely have to resort to direct brain surgery to 
<br>
convince some of them. Which is of course the problem: exactly how far do we 
<br>
allow a &quot;friendly&quot; entity to go in its quest to help us? I would definitely 
<br>
not support such an entity if it ignored the right to one's life, body, 
<br>
thoughts and property.
