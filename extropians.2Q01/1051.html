</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think morality (Friendliness) can be grounded in panhuman affectors and

is in the balance.

<em>&gt; No, they're rules.  They become facts, within a region, if implemented
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>So best guesses amplified by the SI become law within a local region of

space-time where I and/or my descendants have our existence.  I

understand why the Sysop may be a logical necessity but it still makes

me a tad uncomfortable.
