<p>I think we need more of this on the list meta-synthesis from
<br>
several viewpoints!  When I'm hurling plague infected dog meat
<br>
over the wall, sometimes it isn't easy to step back and
<br>
integrate the data points.  [5 Extro-points if you can name
<br>
the movie; 10 Extro-points if name the babe in the movie.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The flaw here is that running someone is not an either/or

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the speed at which the simulation is run.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is true.  This is the Dyson-ian &quot;slow down the clock&quot; and
<br>
you get an infinite amount of computing approach.
<br>
<p>Now, this raises a separate issue -- if, as it looks to be the case,
<br>
protons decay (I'm not sure about this but I get the feeling that
<br>
physicists generally lean in this direction), then all bets are off
<br>
in the long run anyway.  In the *VERY* long run we are all toast unless
<br>
there is a way out of this universe.  Now that would imply that there
<br>
is only so much &quot;living&quot; that can be done before you run out of matter
<br>
in which to &quot;live&quot;.  That being the case, slowing down the clock rate
<br>
(or putting it on hold entirely) rates right up their with the midievil
<br>
practice of bloodletting.  E.g. I am not become death, the destroyer
<br>
of worlds -- I am become Dracula the sucker of life.
<br>
<p>[3 Extro-points if you can explain why &quot;midievil&quot; (or its variants) are
<br>
&nbsp;*not* in &quot;The New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary of the English Language (1987)
<br>
&nbsp;{This is the 4-inch thick ultimate &quot;throw weight&quot; book}.]
<br>
<p>Soooo, Samantha, Eliezer and others -- here are some questions:
<br>
- &quot;If in your godly SI or sub-SI incarnation, you choose to evolve
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward by creating simulated copies with variations on your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theme (presumably re-incorporating the positive results back
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into yourself) are those copies entitled to equal clock cycles?&quot;
<br>
Sub-questions:
<br>
- Are your copies granted &quot;reproductive rights&quot;? (Or are they sterile)?
<br>
- Are your copies granted &quot;simulation rights&quot;? (i.e. they too can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;create evolving-forward copies that inherit the rights granted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to their parents).
<br>
<p>Note the consequences of &quot;granting rights&quot; would seem to be an ever
<br>
decreasing share of the available clock cycles.  In this case
<br>
&quot;death&quot; takes on a new meaning -- you relinquish your clock
<br>
cycles to your ancestors.  [So death is actually quite a noble
<br>
goal because you would have fullfilled your &quot;purpose&quot; in life
<br>
which is to ascertain the viability of a &quot;mind-set mutation&quot;.
<br>
In this case you don't forward-propagate your fitness to
<br>
your offspring -- you back-propagate it to your ancestors.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a certain simulation that you've created is no longer suitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for your purposes, you might merely assign resources such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they get a second of run time every thousand years, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every two thousand years, then every three thousand years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc., a series which does not converge, i.e., it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bestows on your creations unlimited run time.
</em><br>
<p>But not if the longevity of the computronium is limited(!).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ethically, there is nothing wrong with making a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; containing emulations of conscious beings, and then running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it at whatever speed you want.  Or shutting it down.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only moral prohibition is, simply put, &quot;Don't ever be cruel&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>I think I've set the boundaries on this.  They cannot ever
<br>
&quot;realize&quot; that they may be getting an ever decreasing slice
<br>
of the computronium &quot;pie&quot; as their ancestors or offspring create
<br>
their own ancestors or offspring because they must at some point
<br>
suffer the consequences of running in much slower than real
<br>
time (and therefore experience less total &quot;life&quot; before the end).
<br>
You may be able to arrange the hierarchy of realities such
<br>
that they never *do* realize this but then you have either
<br>
handicapped them or lied to them.  [In particular you have to
<br>
make sure they never read the Extro archives...]
<br>
<p>[Yes you can &quot;and then magic happens&quot; your way out of this, but lets
<br>
not do that -- lets assume the Universe really *is* constrained and
<br>
attempt to determine how you make the best choices with regard to
<br>
resource allocation and/or consciousness preservation.]
<br>
<p>Finally, I'll simply note that if &quot;infinite&quot; information storage
<br>
is not possible, then at some time you have to resolve the question
<br>
of whether to erase old copies to allow the creation of new copies.
<br>
<p>If you take the position that &quot;No, old conscious entities that
<br>
only get 1 clock tick per trillion years may *never* be erased&quot;,
<br>
then you clearly sets a limit on your own forward self-evolution&quot;.
<br>
Caring for the &quot;elderly&quot; and potentially &quot;irrelevant&quot; in a society
<br>
has associated costs.  
<br>
<p>The question comes back to a (paraphrased) quote that I cannot
<br>
attribute at this late hour (though it reverberates as Nietzschian&quot;)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I must give up whatever I am for what I may become&quot;.
<br>
<p>Which raises an associated question of who is following the
<br>
&quot;Andromeda&quot; series where the Nietzschians have an important role?
<br>
