<p>Of course we all are saddened to hear of the passing
<br>
of any person, however I am unsure a heart attack
<br>
victim should be counted as caused by the disaster,
<br>
since the deceased could have perished that day
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>Rabble Rouser?  Could it be?  Is it Bob Reuben, the
<br>
computer wearing ultraorthodox Jew with an affinity
<br>
for expensive sports-oriented footware, who unlike
<br>
his lackadaisical namesakes, takes such an intense
<br>
interest in leading the congregation away from
<br>
tradition that he has been compared to an animal
<br>
with a contagious infection?  Is this indeed
<br>
Rabid Reeboked Robbi Robert Reuben?
<br>
<p>Or perhaps I have confused him with one of his namesakes,
<br>
such as the astronaut Robert Reuben, who was in a most
<br>
unfortunate training accident which mangled three of his
<br>
limbs.  The doctors commented, &quot;We can rebuild this
<br>
man, we have the technology.&quot;  They replaced the injured
<br>
body parts with bionic equivalents, but the near death
<br>
experience actually caused a personality change, for
<br>
before he was rather quiet and subdued, but afterwards
<br>
he was a very lively and talkative person.  One of his
<br>
nurses was a born-again Christian, and managed to
<br>
convert him from his Orthodox Judaism.  Afterwards
<br>
his former fellow-synagogue attendees referred to him as
<br>
Rambling Rebuilt Rambunctious Reborn Robert Reuben.
<br>
<p>Or not.  Hey, Rabble Rouser restarted it; I was just going
<br>
to drop the matter.  Or take it to exifreedom.  Then I thought better
<br>
of it, for as soon as I did, someone would start calling that list
<br>
puns-n-guns.  spike
