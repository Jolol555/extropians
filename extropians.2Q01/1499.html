Thanks for posting the excerpts... Nice to read.
<br>
<p>Jim Fehlinger quoted,
<br>
<em>&gt; And as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these successively reach maturity, they take over the functions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of adults whose nature is less perfect; and these, when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are aware that they are no longer of service, elect to retire from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.
</em><br>
<p>This part I found particularly interesting, because it makes the Great
<br>
Brains sound as if they really are robots... zombies who &quot;elect to retire
<br>
from life&quot; as though they never heard of Dylan Thomas, and instead sing
<br>
Robert Zimmerman's Oscar Winning lyrics, &quot;I used to care, but things have
<br>
changed.&quot; I mean, if they're such Great Brains, one might think they could
<br>
figure out how to elevate their service life beyond their &quot;less perfect&quot;
<br>
nature, thus avoiding retirement from life.
<br>
<p>Great Brains ought to be able to solve great problems... which reminds
<br>
me... I think that really great problem solving machines will  precede
<br>
Kurzweil's Spiritual Machines, because people pay big for the expertise of
<br>
agents and intelligent professionals, while some of the greatest spiritual
<br>
geniuses lived as homeless beggars. So, machines are going to have to
<br>
produce some spectacular results before they're allowed to sit around
<br>
being spiritual. Capitalism has pretty much taken over, and enlightened
<br>
masters just don't have any market value in today's economy. But if one
<br>
*does* acquire market value, that's the time to worry... then it's good to
<br>
have a Great Brain that can help us reach a conclusion about how to handle
<br>
this problem.
