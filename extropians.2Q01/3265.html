opportunities this presents to criminals to cause you grief is of no

concern to them. Try opening a bank account w/o a SSN.

<p>#Again, never happen. Even if the books were opened, there are 
<br>
literally thousands of incompatible accounting systems in use within 
<br>
the federal government alone. The Pentagon uses several hundred (last 
<br>
I heard). If you kept your books like this, you'd be thrown in

prison.

<p>#Then of course there's the classified portion of the budget...
