<em>&gt;the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  provincial government and federal department positions as a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  thing.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that this kind of corruption is endemic in the “second world” societies
<br>
I have personally experienced and read about.  Corruption in large institutions
<br>
tends to be one of the primary targets of “reform” of both well-intentioned
<br>
outsiders and internal critics.  However, my experience indicates that “top-down”
<br>
reform of large institutions usually ends up with little success, since
<br>
it seems to be little more than treating the symptoms of a problem with
<br>
deeper roots.  As an example, I have seen many instances of what Europeans
<br>
and “Anglospherians” would call “corruption” at every level of second world
<br>
societies, especially in the realm of private business, that usually isn’t
<br>
addressed by institutional reformers.
<br>
<p>It is VERY difficult to write about this without running the risk of being
<br>
labeled a “cultural chauvinist”,  but I think that being able to honestly
<br>
address this phenomenon is vitally important and may lie at the heart of
<br>
much of the problem of the cultural, economic and political stagnation that
<br>
afflicts the two-thirds of the world that has not been able to make the
<br>
transition to self-reinforcing progressive modernism.  In this regard I
<br>
think the new “culture matters” school of social science has broken through
<br>
to a previously unavailable level of insight and analysis.  Once again I
<br>
recommend Francis Fukuyama’s book “Trust” as an excellent introduction and
<br>
overview of the ideas being discussed in this school.
<br>
<p>To summarize my views on the commonality among the societies that seem to
<br>
be trapped within a matrix of behaviors we might call “corruption”, the
<br>
old saying “it’s not WHAT you know but WHO you know” seems to be the unifying
<br>
thread.  I have seen the same problems in societies as diverse as Mexico
<br>
and China, all relating back to a habit of running institutions (be they
<br>
businesses, universities or government agencies) based on placing a higher
<br>
value on personal relationships than on objective merit or accomplishment.
<br>
&nbsp;Fukuyama’s analysis of how this works in terms of “high-trust” versus “low-trust”
<br>
societies is, in my experience, extremely fruitful.
<br>
<p>In this regard, it is important for us to realize that the “relationship/merit”
<br>
dichotomy isn’t by any means an all-or-nothing duality.  The US certainly
<br>
has its share of “old boy” dynamics within its institutions and classic
<br>
“low-trust” societies like China and Mexico have long-standing traditions
<br>
of merit-based achievement (I’m thinking of the Confucian examination system
<br>
in the case of the former and the almost fetishistic attention that Mexicans
<br>
seem to pay to academic titles like “licenciado” and “engenero”.)
<br>
<p>The challenge seems to lie in gently but effectively shifting the importance
<br>
away from basing social decisions on the “old boy” system of personal and
<br>
family relationships toward one based on more objective measures of individual
<br>
merit.  This can be done at a level of institutional reform, but also must
<br>
be addressed at a broader, deeper and more subtle level of cultural change.
<br>
&nbsp;Of course, the higher stress placed on personal relationships in the societies
<br>
in question can ultimately be seen as so fundamental to their character
<br>
that making this kind of change might be seen as a kind of “cultural suicide.”
<br>
&nbsp;If so, it may be a question of choosing the manner that those cultures
<br>
will be extinguished.  But I prefer to think of it as the same kind of process
<br>
of self-improvement that extropians believe should be a part of each individual’s
<br>
own growth and development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- incompetence: people in positions of decision/power simply lack the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ability and background to understand the problems we have. This is due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  plain ignorance, ideological blindness, or gross mismanagement ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rooted in a tradition of bureocracy.
</em><br>
<p>I think this problem is very closely related to the first one.  The infuriating
<br>
bureaucracy encountered in all parts of the second and third worlds is,
<br>
in fact, just an expression of the “relationship-based” way of organizing
<br>
institutions in low-trust societies.  Again, attempts to address the symptoms
<br>
rather than the cause are doomed to failure.  Streamlining or abolishing
<br>
one set of bureaus will just result in their formal or informal recreation
<br>
in another guise as the “old boy” network re-asserts itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- endemic violence: corruption and incompetence both foster violent answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  situations of conflict in an already much stressed social environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  goes both for the lower-classes individual (many times forced to literally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  steal for a living and food) to the mafias that prosper in association
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the corrupt governments, to the ideologicized security/army forces (still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  deeply stuck into the fascist killer-squad and anti-communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concentration
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  camp mentalities). People trying to change things in a too loudy voice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or denouncing the miserable spoiling of the governing mafias have quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  often found a grim end in a highway ditch, shot on the head by a police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  officer on the pay roll of some politician or businessman.
</em><br>
<p>Here I see an expression of a different face of what may be, again, the
<br>
same root problem.  In this instance, it is the lack of functioning institutions
<br>
and cultural habits of legality.  The most effective check on the urge to
<br>
seek violent solutions to problems of social conflict is the common belief
<br>
that such conflicts can be resolved in a just manner through processes that
<br>
are fair and impartial.  But functioning legal institutions are utterly
<br>
undermined by the kind of personalistic corruption that is endemic in the
<br>
second and third worlds.
<br>
<p>In this regard, I have often noted that one can look at the superficial
<br>
institutions in the societies in question and see a complete and elaborate
<br>
legal system – ON PAPER.  There are courts and law books in Brazil and Malaysia,
<br>
but no one believes that they will actually function in the way that their
<br>
“institutional design” indicates that they ought to.  I often represent
<br>
business interests originating in second world countries in their dealings
<br>
in the US.  One of the first and on-going tasks I have in this work is explaining
<br>
that in fact the courts and laws here actually do work as they say they
<br>
do most of the time here.  There is an expectation that I am a “fixer” rather
<br>
than a real legal counselor and advocate and that my effectiveness is a
<br>
function of some personal influence I may have with the court, rather than
<br>
the merits of the factual or legal arguments we may be able to offer in
<br>
favor of our position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- inefficient and malicious foreign influence: 
</em><br>
<p>[snip a very good but lengthy description of the malign interaction of policies
<br>
of agencies like the IMF with the stagnant ideological polarities in the
<br>
second and third worlds]
<br>
<p>I agree that the prescription of “transparency” and “economy” offered by
<br>
the IMF and World Bank have been largely ineffective in addressing the real
<br>
problems, and I propose that this is precisely because they are treatments
<br>
of the symptoms rather than the causes of the problems.
<br>
<p>Your comment about the ideological stagnation in these societies, Sr. Gonzalia,
<br>
has a very telling example in current news: “Subcomandante Marcos’” speech
<br>
in Mexico City this week was as simplistic and backward as anything I have
<br>
heard.  It could have been given by Che Guevara, and offers the same old
<br>
failed Latin American Marixist ideology of the 1960s as a proposed solution
<br>
to the very real problems that the Zapatistas have called attention to.
<br>
&nbsp;It was a real heartbreak to hear his words, because they cast a bright
<br>
light on the fact that there is no really new thinking going on.
<br>
<p>All of this is only diagnosis and prognosis (the latter because I feel sure
<br>
that the disease will only worsen so long as the root problems remain unaddressed),
<br>
but not prescription.  Unfortunately, this diagnosis cannot lead to a quick
<br>
“cure”, because it points to a basic problem that is not easily addressed
<br>
by simple formulae.  To say that the problem is “cultural” doesn’t suggest
<br>
quick or simple solutions.  How do you change the basic habits of mind that
<br>
are inherent in almost every aspect of people’s lives?  One thing that won’t
<br>
work is simple, “top-down” institutional reform.  Instead, what is required
<br>
is a broad-based and deep impetus to honest self-assessment.  How this can
<br>
be fostered is the real challenge.
