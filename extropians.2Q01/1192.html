In case you are wondering what's this all about...
<br>
<a href="http://rmitz.org/AYB3.swf">http://rmitz.org/AYB3.swf</a>
<br>
<p>Quite elucidative, if you ask me... :)
<br>
<p>I believe it started out being so popular because it's a lousy translation 
<br>
of a japanese game that used a very common plot, that of the 
<br>
Big-bad-guy-that's-gonna-take-over-the-world-with-overwhelming-power theme. 
<br>
Since the translated version spawned such a hilarious phrase (I could 
<br>
imagine people laughing on the floor seeing the bad guy saying &quot;All your 
<br>
base are belong to us&quot; in a way that's supposed to be scary, but isn't that 
<br>
well accomplished), and since these kind of intimidating phrases are used a 
<br>
lot around the world (specialy among the gaming comunity, like for instance, 
<br>
when you &quot;frag&quot; someone - it's a nice humiliating final touch...), they get 
<br>
to a lot of people's ears. Now imagine that bad guy getting everywhere, in a 
<br>
&quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; style. You can't help but laugh (ok, maybe you 
<br>
won't, but young people will). Thus the popularity of it. It's as if someone 
<br>
made up a new joke. How many of you know the same joke? This particular joke 
<br>
consists in a video. A picture is worth a thousand words. Imagine how many 
<br>
is a video worth...
