<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;     The book THE BELL CURVE I believe suggests a different cause.

According
<br>
<em>&gt; to that book along about 1900 the economy had become high tech enough that
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; began sweeping up all the High IQ types to serve it's needs.  According to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TBC the congregation of the GT (the upper 5% or the IQ curve) has
</em><br>
accelerated
<br>
<em>&gt; all through the 20th century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     It seems to me this phenomena might explain the Flynn effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron H.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Miles Storfer has a more synthetic explanation, unifying the Flynn effect,
<br>
with neocortex and myopia increase in a neo-Lamarckian explanatory framework
<br>
(of all things):
<br>
<p>(<a href="http://www.gbhap.com/journals/148/storfer/top.htm">http://www.gbhap.com/journals/148/storfer/top.htm</a>)
<br>
&quot;International Journal of
<br>
NEUROSCIENCE
<br>
<p>Autumn 1999:
<br>
Special Monograph Issue on
<br>
Myopia, Intelligence,
<br>
and the Expanding Human Neocortex:
<br>
Behavioral Influences and Evolutionary Implications
<br>
<p>FREE: DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE ARTICLE
<br>
<p><p>In Volume 98, Numbers 3-4 of the the International Journal of Neuroscience,
<br>
Dr. Miles Storfer, The Foundation for Brain Research, Delray Beach, FL. USA,
<br>
proposes that the prenatal development of human intelligence can be
<br>
influenced by our parents' postnatal environment - not by altering the DNA
<br>
sequences of our protein-coding genes, but by changing the &quot;developmental
<br>
blueprint for gene expression&quot; that unfolds in the womb (to wit, changes in
<br>
the timing and extent of gene expression in environmentally-stressed
<br>
portions of the developing neocortex).
<br>
<p>Briefly, the monograph:
<br>
<p><p>documents that three events have swept the developed world over this past
<br>
century:
<br>
<p>(a) a very large increase in the size of certain association areas of the
<br>
neocortex;
<br>
(b) a gradual, but very substantial increase in measured intelligence; and
<br>
(c) an upsurge in the prevalence and severity of myopia;
<br>
<p><p>suggests how these events are related;
<br>
<p>presents findings strongly suggesting that these changes are mostly
<br>
inherited, and begin to unfold prenatally;
<br>
<p>buttresses this emergent theory with findings from animal studies; - and
<br>
<p>suggests how the non-Mendelian inheritance mechanism, genomic imprinting,
<br>
might enable the impetus for adaptively-induced changes in the timing and
<br>
extent of prenatal gene expression to be encoded on developing sperm in a
<br>
manner that permits their conveyance across the germline barrier. This could
<br>
explain the rapidity and enormity of phenotypic change in complex mammals
<br>
despite no speedup in rates of molecular evolution, and the overwhelming
<br>
dominance of two-sex mammalian reproduction.
<br>
If true, the implications of this proposed adaptive inheritance theory are
<br>
enormous. They include:
<br>
<p><p>our children are not doomed to enter the world from the same (neocortical)
<br>
starting point as our grandparents, except for changes arising from random
<br>
mutation, fitness for survival and the other well-articulated neo-Darwinian
<br>
inheritance mechanisms; and
<br>
<p>cultural differences in the &quot;shape&quot; of intelligence are in large part an
<br>
outgrowth of differences in ancestral child-rearing and educational
<br>
practices - and can be altered over very few generations &quot;
<br>
<p>I've also heard of another, but I can't find the reference right now. The
<br>
idea is that recent improvements in obstetrics has lead to more successful
<br>
births of largerbrained babies.
<br>
Mark.
