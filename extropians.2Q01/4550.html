<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;It seems that thinkers in the field of probability and statistics are

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fact that such a divsion has existed amongst educated people for over sixty
</em><br>

<p>It's quite admirable to be able to so easily admit that you've
<br>
been wrong (even if it was a minor aspect of the argument).  Now
<br>
if you were as slippery as I am---they don't call me &quot;eeL&quot; for
<br>
nothing---then you'd learn to change sides at the first moment
<br>
that it started to appear that you were wrong, and thus convince
<br>
a lot of the spectators that you were on the winning side all
<br>
along.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The impersistence of an argument is strong evidence that one side is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right.  The persistence of an argument is necessarily (from a Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perspective) a blow, but not necessarily a *severe* blow; it can in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be a very weak blow.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  Did I ever say otherwise?   :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would tend to see a Frequentist as a special case of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesian making very odd assumptions about the priors.
</em><br>
<p>Like maybe **no assumptions**.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By contrast, I can think of no natural way to view a Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a Frequentist making odd assumptions,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a Frequentist can only allow that a Bayesian is making
<br>
intelligent assumptions.  Only the scruples (or, more likely,
<br>
dogmatism) of the Frequentist causes him to shy away from
<br>
those most reasonable assumptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;which seems to me to place Frequentism at a severe disadvantage if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general theory is desired.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that a general theory is desired (contrary to the
<br>
existence of an actual &quot;division into armed camps&quot;).  As Rodney
<br>
King said, &quot;Can't we just all get along?&quot;  Amara Graps in her
<br>
last post on this topic refered to an email she'd posted in 1999
<br>
that was quite illuminating about Bayesian procedures in the 
<br>
sciences.  Evidently, for many scientific purposes, Bayesianism
<br>
works better.  I wonder what the Frequentists would retort.  Maybe
<br>
I should send them my problem of the guy who consults a mathematician
<br>
about the sex of his unborn child.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is not a question of &quot;making up prior probabilities out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of thin air&quot;, but rather the *necessity* of specifying *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;set of priors in order for a well-defined problem to exist at all. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes; a well-defined sensible real world problem, that's for sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the Frequentists don't like our priors they are perfectly willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make up their own; the key point is that the priors should be explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stated and exposed to public challenge, and to do otherwise is indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;concealing the problem instead of solving it&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I think that in most cases they do.  On most problems, there
<br>
isn't any disagreement, just as you'd expect.  They merely get
<br>
(childishly?) upset when Bayesians pronounce about a certain
<br>
problem, &quot;The probability is X&quot;, when all they can do is point
<br>
to likelihood curves and what not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, Lee, I suppose you would argue that the so-called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;if statement&quot; in programming should really be named
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;if-and-only-if statement&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Could you explain?  I don't get it.
