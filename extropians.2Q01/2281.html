Subject: Modeling God (was Re: The pool we're trying to paddle in)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Atheists can indeed say &quot;god doesn't exist&quot;.  For a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nice, and somewhat lengthy, article on the subject, go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Modeling God: Deferred Abusrdity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.americanatheist.org/aut97/T2/modelinggod.html">http://www.americanatheist.org/aut97/T2/modelinggod.html</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I realize religions have pat (unacceptable) answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Of course a wise person would simply take Pascal's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wager (Blaise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;look it up) and say they believe. Come to think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, I repent!!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Pascal's Wager is rather silly, not to mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypocritical.  Does someone employing Pascal's Wager
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that he can trick an omniscient being by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believing in something &quot;just in case&quot;?  And which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion is it that such a person is to believe in? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With the thousands of choices available how are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to be sure you've chosen the right one?  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can't believe in all of them, as many of them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diametrically opposed, and some explicitly condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;    Additionally, for most religions one just can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say &quot;I believe&quot; and leave it at that.  One must also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree to a certain set of dictates that one must live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thier lives by.  So, if the Wagerist does decide on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one particular religious denomination, he risks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasting his entire life in servitude to a lie.  Not my
</em><br>
cup of tea.  :-)
<br>
<p>The onus surely is on the person making the truth
<br>
claim (God exists) to provide some sort of evidence,
<br>
not on everyone else to produce counter-evidence.
<br>
<p>Not only is there no scrap of evidence for any of
<br>
the supernaturalist claims .... but I don't even think
<br>
the (linguistic) truth claim is intelligible ... God is
<br>
invisible, and indescribable ... so who can even start
<br>
to believe in such a nebulous concept, it just doesn't
<br>
make sense even on a conceptual level, no two
<br>
theologians seem to share the same concept of God.
