<p>Only because the required experiment hasn't been done yet.  You

have to do a differential gene expression study on a set of

astronauts on the ground and then again after they have been

in space for 3 months (minimizing their exercise).  Perhaps
<br>
morally questionable but you could request volunteers.
<br>
<p>Half a dozen differential comparisons should have the stress
<br>
regulatory pathway jumping out at you.  Then you backtrack
<br>
it through the genome to find the common regulatory control
<br>
element(s) and develop drugs or regulatory factors that &quot;fix&quot;
<br>
the pathway.  This stuff is much less than rocket science
<br>
at this point.

Well at least the game should be popular in Germany.

<p><em>&gt; and the people behind the space effort calculate that the value of owning a

<p>I'd like to be at the meeting where you get that many optimists (with
<br>
the necessary financial throw weight) in a room.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that this is a somewhat weak case, but then again, it is a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Remind me at some future point when I've relocated elsewhere to
<br>
invite you to visit for a few days.  We'll make fudge together
<br>
so you can see how *sticky* it is.
