<em>&gt; Exactly. It is a milleniarist meme I really get irritated at. It blocks

<em>&gt; concerns with its glorius light and blinds us with it. The credo that we

</em><br>
<em>&gt; end time thinking it engenders is more of the type &quot;when will it occur?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than &quot;what are the options?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed in part.  I think it does behoove us to, not repent, but ask
<br>
ourselves some pretty deep questions about just what it is we wish to
<br>
achieve, who it is we as individuals and peoples are, what it is we wish
<br>
to become and most importantly how we might get there as peaceably as
<br>
possible from where we are today. 
<br>
<p>The milleniarist theme strikes a chord of truth because we are coming up
<br>
on literally the end of the world as we know it.  What will we make
<br>
along the way and afterward though?   What are the central themes?  How
<br>
do we free ourselves from what is now enough to see with fresh eyes but
<br>
not free ourselves from all moorings so much we float off into fantasy
<br>
like so many hot air balloons? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't believe in phase transitions to posthumanity started by a tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nucleus (other than that ideas and inventions have to come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere, and this is where the entreprenurs of thought are needed),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will encompass a large part of our society and economy. I use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term &quot;a swell&quot; - a broad change across society, possibly taking quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some time - rather than the elitist &quot;spike&quot; of a transition caused by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some single nucleus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Here I disagree.  The difference in capability and richness of
<br>
experience between technological haves and have nots will become so
<br>
great and the cost of technology will drop precipitously enough that the
<br>
technology will spread extremely quickly if we go the relative slow ramp
<br>
up by augmentation.  Add AI or NT and the curve becomes extremely
<br>
steep.  It is not elitism but simply the size and power of the coming
<br>
wave.  Whether a few doppler out of sight and change everything or the
<br>
masses rise that steeply and quickly is not very relevant to the size or
<br>
too its steepness.
<br>
The result will be substantially the same.
<br>
<p>I humbly suggest we get on with &quot;preparing the way&quot; for what is coming
<br>
and with shaping it where we can.
