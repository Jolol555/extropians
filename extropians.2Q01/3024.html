<p>Some Psychological Factors for Promoting Exceptional Athletic
<br>
Performance
<br>
<p>Brent S. Rushall, PhD San Diego State University
<br>
<p>Some psychological factors associated with performance
<br>
enhancement in serious athletes are discussed. Those factors
<br>
are delimited to what occurs during a competitive
<br>
performance. Four mental skills: (a) segmenting, (b)
<br>
task-relevant thought content, (c) positive self-talk, and (d)
<br>
mood words are reviewed. Typical thinking developed through
<br>
sport participation, a very common control condition, is not
<br>
conducive to optimal or maximal performance. The
<br>
implementations of these mental skills produce athletic
<br>
performance enhancements, even in elite athletes. Any extra
<br>
effort or physiological cost does not accompany
<br>
improvements. It is proposed that the teaching of these and
<br>
similar skills must become part of an athlete's experience if
<br>
performance standards are to be improved further.
<br>
<p>Psychology is the study of behavior, it being both covert and
<br>
overt. It is relatively easy to investigate overt behaviors
<br>
accurately and reliably and to employ independent verification
<br>
of phenomena, but when it comes to covert behaviors, such as
<br>
thoughts and emotional interpretations, the ability to verify
<br>
phenomena independently is usually thwarted. While it remains
<br>
possible to manipulate external events and observe behavioral
<br>
outcomes, functional relationships between environmental
<br>
psychological factors and performances can be described. It is
<br>
not scientifically appropriate to attribute outcomes to
<br>
intermediary events such as thoughts and perceptions when they
<br>
have not been directly observed. A position on that restriction
<br>
has been described elsewhere (Rushall, 1992). While talk is of
<br>
thoughts and covert activities, it is the external stimulating
<br>
events that influence them which are really the causal factors
<br>
in the research works discussed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious Competitive Settings
<br>
<p>A serious competitive setting is where the consequences
<br>
of performance are most important and strongest for an
<br>
athlete.  Factors that affect an athlete's perception of
<br>
this setting have been described in the Sport Pressure
<br>
Checklist (Rushall &amp; Sherman, 1987). Variations in these
<br>
factors produce performance inconsistencies (Teed, 1987)
<br>
as well as suggest patterns that predispose excellent
<br>
performances (Rushall, 1987).  In challenging and serious
<br>
performance situations, it has been found that
<br>
performance-oriented &quot;strategies&quot; (plans) of specific
<br>
detail have notable effects on performance consistency
<br>
and reliability (Coles, Herzberger, Sperber, &amp; Goetz,
<br>
1975; Vestewig, 1978). The need for specific preparations
<br>
is now commonly recognized in several fields (e.g.,
<br>
business, performing arts) and its founding research so
<br>
convincing that it is now rarely investigated. However,
<br>
it is still being neglected in the majority of sporting
<br>
situations by coaches and sport psychologists.  Further,
<br>
when strategies are formulated primarily by athletes they
<br>
generally produce the following benefits: (a) reduction
<br>
in uncertainty and interpretive distractions and the
<br>
stress of negative situations, (b) enhanced performance
<br>
consistency, (c) improved coping capacity for problems,
<br>
and (d) minimized performance deteriorations (Averill,
<br>
1973; Hollandsworth, Glazeski, &amp; Dressel, 1978). Research
<br>
reports of the value of performance strategies in sports
<br>
have been published (e.g., wrestling, Horton &amp; Shelton,
<br>
1978; basketball, Meyers &amp; Schleser, 1980; skiing,
<br>
Rotella, Gansneder, Ojala, &amp; Billing, 1980; swimming,
<br>
Rushall, 1978; rowing, Rushall, 1990).
<br>
<p>Factor 1: Performance Segmenting
<br>
<p>If an event is of long duration, it needs to be broken
<br>
into segments.  Partitions should be short enough for the
<br>
athlete to totally concentrate on what needs to be
<br>
thought of and done in that period. This assists focusing
<br>
on the completion of successful competition elements.
<br>
Structuring performances in this manner is called
<br>
&quot;segmenting.&quot; In the U.S. Navy, a similar approach to
<br>
combat missions is known as &quot;compartmentalizing&quot; (e.g.,
<br>
TOP GUN).  Segmenting originates from two sources. First,
<br>
the goal-setting literature has shown that distant goals
<br>
have less effect on performance than do more proximal
<br>
goals (House, 1973). Short-term performance goals that
<br>
focus on the processes needed for successful behavior
<br>
enhance performance (Harackiewicz, Abrahams, &amp; Wageman,
<br>
1987). Second, individuals faced with extensive tasks
<br>
usually break them down into more manageable segments
<br>
(Gibson &amp; Heads, 1989, describing the across-Australia
<br>
run by Tony Rafferty).  Botterill (1977) noted successful
<br>
young athletes spontaneously reconstructed an endurance
<br>
strength-task into shorter performance segments, each
<br>
having its own goal or goals. A skier overcame
<br>
difficulties with traversing a slope when attention was
<br>
shifted to progress by task parts that eventually lead to
<br>
completion of the total run (Syer &amp; Connolly, 1984).
<br>
World-champion target sportspersons have reported
<br>
attempting to fire &quot;one shot at a time&quot; during extended
<br>
shooting contests (Wigger, Anderson, Whitaker, &amp; Harmon,
<br>
1980). Performing artists have intuitively divided long
<br>
performances into stages (e.g., acts and scenes,
<br>
movements) so that performance quality can be
<br>
maintained. Thus, theory and practice support the notion
<br>
of segmenting extensive tasks for improved performance
<br>
outcomes.  Manges (1990) and Wahl (1991) both tested the
<br>
segmented versus total performance goal-orientation in
<br>
runners. Using intraparticipant research designs, the
<br>
value of short-term process goals over terminal (distal)
<br>
goals was conclusively demonstrated. Manges' three
<br>
runners improved 2.0-2.7% while Wahl's ranged from
<br>
1.1-6.5% with one participant not improving (-0.9%). The
<br>
performance differences could not be accounted for in
<br>
terms of altered physiological functioning, a phenomenon
<br>
noted long ago by Wilmore (1970).  The way segments are
<br>
structured and their content is particularly
<br>
individual. Differences in segmenting strategies and
<br>
moderating factors need to be determined to understand
<br>
this factor more clearly. The anecdotal and goal-theory
<br>
literature at present is inadequate for fully explaining
<br>
this phenomenon.
<br>
<p>Factor 2: Task-Relevant Thought Content
<br>
<p>Performance efficiency is reduced by distraction and
<br>
enhanced by relevant concentration. There are some minor
<br>
exceptions to this principle (e.g., cognitive
<br>
interference), but in tasks performed under stressful
<br>
circumstances, the focus of attention has to be on the
<br>
processes for completing the performance to achieve the
<br>
highest level of outcome (Jones &amp; Hardy, 1989). This is
<br>
particularly true in sports. Cognitive concepts such as
<br>
&quot;attentional focus,&quot; &quot;concentration,&quot; and &quot;flow&quot; are
<br>
characterized by a singular task-orientation, although
<br>
that orientation varies according to the stage and type
<br>
of activity. &quot;The focus on task-relevant information is
<br>
intended to ensure that all resources available to an
<br>
athlete in a competition are used fully and in the most
<br>
efficient manner possible&quot; (Rushall, 1995, p. 8.13).
<br>
While task-relevant concentration might seem to be an
<br>
obvious characteristic of performance control, it is
<br>
surprising how few athletes develop it effectively
<br>
through normal training experiences. Training seems to
<br>
develop a form of habitual/practice thinking that does
<br>
not transfer effective benefits to competitive
<br>
settings. Intraparticipant alternating-treatments designs
<br>
have been used to compare &quot;normal/habitual&quot; thinking with
<br>
sport-specific task-relevant thinking that has been
<br>
individualized to the participant. The experimental
<br>
variable in this paradigm is confounded between
<br>
individuality and task-specificity. Some studies have
<br>
introduced other unrelated thinking conditions (e.g.,
<br>
Chorkawy, 1982; Ford, 1982; McKinnon, 1985) for further
<br>
comparisons.  Group designs (Crossman, 1977; Selkirk,
<br>
1980) do not demonstrate effects as well as
<br>
single-participant experiments.  Task-relevant thinking
<br>
appears more consistent in influence the higher the
<br>
standard of the athlete:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian elite rowers (N = 5) improved an average of 3.5%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on an ergometer task (Rushall, 1984b).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian national team cross-country skiers improved an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average of 1.96% over a training track lap (Rushall, Hall,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roux, Sasseville, &amp; Rushall, 1988).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norwegian junior national team cross-country skiers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improved an average of 2.5% using both skating and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classical techniques over a training track lap
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kristiansen, 1992).
<br>
<p>A common feature of these studies was the opportunity for
<br>
the athletes to individualize the content and nature of
<br>
their thoughts after receiving instructions. That feature
<br>
may be a very significant moderating variable.  The
<br>
normal/habitual thinking developed through training and
<br>
coaching is far from optimal in its effect on
<br>
performance. Even though coaches commonly claim to teach
<br>
and stress &quot;technique,&quot; it was only after instructions
<br>
and practice to use self- and activity-specific detailed
<br>
content that performances improved.
<br>
<p>Factor 3: Positive Self-Statements (Thinking)
<br>
<p>Positive thinking is the covert utterance of positive
<br>
self-statements. Taylor's work (1979) showed that under a
<br>
positive mental orientation, the body's physiology
<br>
performs more efficiently than when under an aversive or
<br>
negative mind-set (see also Schuele &amp; Wisenfeld, 1983;
<br>
Vera, Vila, &amp; Godoy, 1994). Positive self-talk is also
<br>
related to factors associated with improved performance,
<br>
such as coping (Girodo &amp; Roehl, 1978), self-concept
<br>
(Smit, 1992), and self-efficacy (Weiss, Wiese, &amp; Klint,
<br>
1989).  Dalton, Maier, and Posavac (1977) reported the
<br>
direct effect of negative thoughts on swimming
<br>
performance. Among 24 junior tennis players during
<br>
tournament matches it was found that negative self-talk
<br>
was associated with losing, and players who used and
<br>
reported believing in the utility of positive self-talk
<br>
won more points than players who did not (Van Raalte,
<br>
Brewer, Rivera, &amp; Petitpas, 1994). Positive self-talk was
<br>
an important part of a game strategy for improving
<br>
basketball performance (Kendall, Hrycaiko, Martin, &amp;
<br>
Kendall, 1990), for learning compulsory figures in
<br>
ice-skating (Ming, 1993), and for increasing the number
<br>
of games won from deuce-point in a tennis player
<br>
(Desiderato &amp; Miller, 1979).  Intraparticipant
<br>
investigations on the effect of positive self-talk on
<br>
performance in a variety of settings produced results
<br>
similar to those of task-relevant thinking:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian rowers improved from 1.21-2.20% on an evaluative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ergometer task (Rushall, 1984b).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wide range of Norwegian cross-country skiers improved an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;average of 3.63% over a test distance (Holingen &amp; Vikander,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1987).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superior Canadian age-group swimmers improved from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.39-2.13% over two distances (Rushall &amp; Shewchuk, 1989).
<br>
<p>An emphasis on positive self-talk while performing a task
<br>
enhances performance. This further supports the
<br>
inadequacy of habitual sport thinking for provoking an
<br>
optimal training or competitive response.  Self-talk is
<br>
an individual skill that needs to be practiced before it
<br>
is evaluated for influence. The general level of effect
<br>
is marginally less than that of task-relevant thinking,
<br>
but that is not surprising considering it usually does
<br>
not entertain direct effects on skill economy.  Rather,
<br>
it sets the &quot;atmosphere&quot; for efficient physiological
<br>
functioning which then has to be translated into
<br>
efficient movement patterns.  There are certain
<br>
characteristics of positive self-talk which are
<br>
recommended for use in practical situations (Rushall,
<br>
1995). Positive self-statements should not be trivial,
<br>
cheerleader-type expressions (e.g., &quot;go, go, go,&quot; &quot;let's
<br>
do it now&quot;). Four appropriate uses in competitions are:
<br>
(a) encouraging oneself, (b) handling effort, (c)
<br>
evaluating segment goals, and (d) general positive
<br>
self-talk to maintain atmosphere. It should be spread
<br>
throughout a strategy. It could be most effective when
<br>
second-person phrasing is used (e.g., &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your&quot;),
<br>
which produces a perception of control over oneself. The
<br>
dynamics of positive self-talk in sport settings need to
<br>
be delineated further.
<br>
<p>Factor 4: Mood Words
<br>
<p>Another form of covert vocabulary involves particular
<br>
words that emote or energize the individual. Language has
<br>
basic words which, when said or thought with appropriate
<br>
feeling and emphasis, have some movement or emotional
<br>
outcome. They cause a physical reaction in the body. Some
<br>
languages/cultures use these words more frequently (e.g.,
<br>
Italian, Arabic) than others (e.g., English). Performing
<br>
artists frequently use simple words emoted in a
<br>
particular way to promote a behavior that expresses a
<br>
mood. Mood words require no translation. The expressive
<br>
thinking of words should produce a feeling appropriate
<br>
for some performance capacity. If a feeling does not
<br>
occur, then the content is inappropriate and will be
<br>
ineffectual.  Mood words can reflect various performance
<br>
capacities.  Typically, a list of monosyllabic synonyms
<br>
for strength, power (force), speed, agility, balance, and
<br>
endurance are presented to an athlete. The athlete
<br>
selects from the lists, or augments personal words that
<br>
have a similar meaning, the capacities and words that are
<br>
meaningful to him or her. Those words are then inserted
<br>
into a performance strategy at the time and during the
<br>
appropriate task-relevant thoughts when they will be most
<br>
effective. For example, a rower taking the catch in a
<br>
stroke might think &quot;BOOM&quot; as a way of elevating the power
<br>
of that part of the stroke. Rowers have reported that
<br>
this does increase performance over thinking normally or
<br>
imaging what is intended. That talk is more effective
<br>
than imagery during performance has been reported (Oei &amp;
<br>
Barber, 1989).  Mood words of this type increase the
<br>
effectiveness of thinking. When one wants to be powerful,
<br>
thinking words that make one feel powerful will increase
<br>
the actions of power. Rushall (1984a) reported
<br>
unpublished data on a grip-strength test with four
<br>
Canadian rowers. Three thought-content conditions were
<br>
used: (a) normal thought content as a control, (b) the
<br>
utterance of a phrase that had the correct meaning but
<br>
was unrelated to the emotional state needed to be strong
<br>
(e.g., the words &quot;exert force&quot;), and (c) the utterance of
<br>
mood words, such as &quot;crush,&quot; &quot;grind,&quot; etc., of the
<br>
athletes' choosing. All athletes recorded the strongest
<br>
grip under the emotive mood word condition. Mood words
<br>
enhance performance marginally better than either
<br>
task-relevant content or positive self-statements
<br>
(Holingen &amp; Vikander, 1987; Kristiansen, 1992; Rushall,
<br>
1984b; Rushall et al., 1988; Rushall &amp; Shewchuck, 1989).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closure
<br>
<p>Task-relevant content, positive self-statements, and mood
<br>
words presently are perceived to be the structures that
<br>
should be employed as thought content during a segmented
<br>
competitive performance. They should be integrated into a
<br>
meaningful dialogue by each athlete, and practiced,
<br>
performed, and evaluated for effect and possible
<br>
improvement. Their inclusion in training programs is not
<br>
difficult, and practice could constitute &quot;sporting
<br>
homework&quot; in a fashion that is not possible with other
<br>
performance factors. The magnitudes of the performance
<br>
enhancements reported in controlled research settings
<br>
with high-level athletes makes the use of thought-content
<br>
skills an imperative for athletes wishing to maximize
<br>
their performance and for coaches seeking to optimize
<br>
their effectiveness.  These four psychological
<br>
determinants of performance produced enhancements and
<br>
alterations in a large number of the studies and
<br>
participants considered. Performance improvements
<br>
occurred without any notable extra perceived exertion
<br>
(Chorkawy, 1982; Ford, 1982; McKinnon, 1985), increase in
<br>
direct measurements of physiological parameters
<br>
(Kristiansen, 1992; Morgan, Horstman, Cymerman, &amp; Stokes,
<br>
1983; Rushall et al., 1988; Wilmore, 1970), or other
<br>
increased thought dynamics, such as the degree of
<br>
concentration or &quot;trying harder&quot; (Chorkawy, 1982; Ford,
<br>
1982; McKinnon, 1985). These mental activities are a
<br>
&quot;painless&quot; avenue for assisting athletes to improve. When
<br>
athletes are exposed to these skills and evaluate their
<br>
effects they are particularly enthusiastic about their
<br>
value and use.  Psychology offers many performance
<br>
determinants, only a few being addressed here. It needs
<br>
to be recognized that psychology becomes more important,
<br>
the higher the standard of competitor. It has been
<br>
reported that psychological factors are better
<br>
discriminators of high-level performance capacity than
<br>
physiological measures (McDonald, 1984). For example,
<br>
Silva, Shultz, Haslam, Martin, and Murray (1985) found
<br>
that psychological variables discriminated Olympic
<br>
wrestling team qualifiers from nonqualifiers better than
<br>
physiological variables.  Psychology has a major role to
<br>
play in determining the levels of performance achieved in
<br>
competitive settings. Athletes should be appraised of the
<br>
techniques and provided practice opportunities for their
<br>
implementation as part of the evolving professions of
<br>
coaching and sport psychology.
