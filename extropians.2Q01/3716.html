Cynical postulate: He made a decision to rely upon the advice of 
<br>
someone(s) older and wiser, who remained in the background. 
<br>
Alternatively, could be he was freakishly advanced (in a good way) 
<br>
from a very young age and so began gathering relevant experience and 
<br>
accumulating wisdom while others his age were still sucking their 
<br>
thumbs--in which case, the wisdom *still* took time to develop, and 
<br>
he simply began earlier. Not knowing him, I can only speculate.
