I said:

<em>&gt; &gt;What is interesting about this is that it seems when the

<em>&gt; &gt;astronomers see something they don't expect, they go back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and check the instruments... :-)  I wonder if the SIs think

<p>On Sat, 24 Mar 2001 <a href="mailto:CurtAdams@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20ASTRONOMY:%20Dark%20Matter%20&amp;%20White%20Dwarfs&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.UW2.4.20.0103240316140.14555-100000@www.aeiveos.com&gt;">CurtAdams@aol.com</a> responded:
<br>
<em>&gt; Hey, that's a very logical response.  Really, instruments do goof a lot.
</em><br>
<p>True, but I can just picture the astronomers going, &quot;When we
<br>
look at all these stars the instrument is fine, but when we
<br>
look at this one star the instrument gets flakey...&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Now personally, I cannot imagine any artificial structures that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would match the spectra of these two objects. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the predicted spectrum of a semi-Dysonized star?
</em><br>
<p>I've thought a fair amount about that (since part of my talks
<br>
at the OSETI III conference were about suggesting that scientists
<br>
look at Long-Period Variable Stars) and it isn't clear.
<br>
<p>Imagine building out the Dyson sphere from an orbiting planet.
<br>
Presumably you begin to send your satellites out ahead of and
<br>
behind the planet in orbit.  Or perhaps send them sunward
<br>
or anti-sunward (depending on the planet's orbit).  You probably
<br>
want to do this in a fashion that requires a slowly increasing
<br>
Delta-V (as you slowly get more energy to throw at the problem).
<br>
<p>Spike worked out an approach where you could do this using photon
<br>
pressure alone but I think it takes a *long* time.  He or Doug
<br>
might want to comment on how you could do it for the lowest cost
<br>
if you had material you didn't mind throwing away (after all you
<br>
will be collecting large amounts of mass from the solar wind).
<br>
<p>Now bear in mind that these orbits are going to periodically
<br>
obscure the star as they pass between the star and the earth
<br>
along our line of sight.  So the visible and IR power output
<br>
of the star are going to undergo wierd oscillations.  Depending
<br>
on orbits of the planets from which these are being constructed
<br>
these oscillations may range from days to years.  Then there
<br>
will be a long period shift as more and more of the energy
<br>
output gets moved from visible into the IR (effectively making
<br>
the star &quot;cooler&quot;).  So we would have to observe these stars
<br>
periodically to see what is happening to their light output.
