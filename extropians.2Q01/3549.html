<p><em>&gt;Ah, you really don't understand, do you?  Nanotech is within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generation or just a hair more. Not in the far future.  
</em><br>
<p>Nanotech has done, to date, nothing.  Nobody has even a simple nanomachine
<br>
going.  Until somebody demonstrates machine-phase is even *possible*
<br>
it's way premature to expect it to even be practical, never mind superior
<br>
to liquid-phase &quot;nanotech&quot; - i.e., the biotech being belittled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ditto for AI. 
</em><br>
<p>AI can't even do grammar checks yet.  Moore's law may pull it out yet.  Or may
<br>
not, depending on how efficiently Mother Nature used our neurons and how
<br>
high a frequency of gamma rays we can focus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Uploading may take another generation.  If we don't start preparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ourselves as best we can for this rate and kinds of change we will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;caught [more] dangerously flat-footed. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm all for planning ahead; but none of the advanced stuff we talk about is 
<br>
imminent.  AI is the only possibility for this generation.  Nanotech is still
<br>
a speculation.  Biotech may produce wonderful stuff soon; but we're not
<br>
about to improve brains yet because we don't know how, and we'll need
<br>
to be *very* sure before we do it.  Even an AI &quot;singularity&quot; won't be a 
<br>
singularity.  We'll shift from a 20-year doubling time to a 18-month
<br>
doubling time, until Moore's law runs out.  It'll be like the whole world
<br>
is a successful startup company for a few years to a few decades;
<br>
then it will be over.
