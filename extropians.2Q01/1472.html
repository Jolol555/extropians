<p>&lt;&lt; So, perhaps the need for H1Bs is completely real? &gt;&gt;
<br>
It might just be.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Because... there is no shortfall. Or, if there is, in the areas of medical
<br>
and legal people you can't just ship 'em in, because of regulation of the
<br>
industries.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Let's hear it for deregulation! Then let the howls begin. :-)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;There are definitely contracting shops around who are trucking in Indian
<br>
coders (damn their skillful hides) and selling their services. I know it's
<br>
happening here (oz), dunno bout the US.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It's happening by the ton-full in the USA. I had spoken with one contractor 
<br>
that the H-1B thing was going on, as I have suggested it, but it was a good 
<br>
deal for him. Ah Well! He did send 700.00 to his Mom in India, which he said 
<br>
let her live quite nicely for about 4 months. He's  a nice guy.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;There's no shortage of managers!!!&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Boy! But there is a shortage of Good Manager. Management By Ego MBE sucks!  
<br>
Also these management buddy-boys seems to be inviolable from being replaced 
<br>
by somebody out of country. There's the rub. Who is to say we are not being 
<br>
cheated out of a great manager from Mongolia (properly trained in American 
<br>
English and culture!) instead of some tyrannical egoist? Free Global 
<br>
competition means free global competition -no exceptions.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If not, and it shits us, then we retrain into a new industry. Hell knows,
<br>
coders have been involved in making that happen (redundancy) to enough other
<br>
workers out there. No-one will cry for us if it is our turn, mark my words!
<br>
<p>Emlyn
<br>
(blah, lost my sig)&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If that industry doesn't physically exist, then where to? Sounds like Kurt 
<br>
Vonnegut's Player Piano, in which all people have been replaced by 
<br>
automation. Or better yet, Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash.
