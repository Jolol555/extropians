<em>&gt; &gt;What I would like to see is a bit more discussion about the problems in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the present and near future that does not end in &quot;The singularity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;make it irrelevant&quot;, &quot;The government/illuminati will stop all such

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fix&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Problem is, as much as many of us are focused on dealing with the problems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the day, we are all to some extent or another looking forward to the day 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when our hopes for the future become reality.  My guess is that for most on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list that hope for the future is summed up in the term &quot;Singularity.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Not for me. While I like the singularity concept, I don't think it is a
<br>
good concept to base or focus ones thinking on. It lumps together a lot
<br>
of disparate things under the same umbrella and then makes it seem like
<br>
the only issue is getting there. I prefer to imagine the future as an
<br>
escalating exponential, which we ride while dodging or solving the
<br>
problems that appear. There will be no End of History, just business as
<br>
usual but each day infinitely grander and more complex than the previous
<br>
one. Maybe it will look like a capital 'S' Singularity from the outside,
<br>
but that perspective is not as important as the inside view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some have said that predicting what follows the Singularity is akin to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicting what becomes of the laws of physics past the event horizon of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black hole.  Maybe so, I don't know.  But it does seem to me that the best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope for solution to problems that so far seem intractible (religious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hatred, world hunger, poverty, incurable disease, etc.) would be the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application of a good dose of super-intelligent friendly AI.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think most of the above problems are not intractable at all
<br>
even today. But we might need rethinking policies, convince a lot of
<br>
people and do hard practical things (what about an aid organisation
<br>
spreading internet-based education and communication, especially into
<br>
oppressive nations so that government monopolies are broken? unilateral
<br>
removal of customs? new intellectual property laws? improved scientific
<br>
publishing and peer review on the net?). In fact, just adding a friendly
<br>
SI to the current world is not obviously going to help. How is it really
<br>
supposed to make religious fanatics nicer? When the SI declares that the
<br>
War on Drug is wrong, will politicians immediately change opinion or
<br>
will they say that it is the SI that is wrong and perhaps pass bills
<br>
against it? 
<br>
<p>Waiting for something to solve the burning problems of today in some
<br>
unspecified future is not a particularly dynamic attitude, in my
<br>
opinion. Sure, we should take radical future possibilities into account
<br>
but not *rely* on them.
