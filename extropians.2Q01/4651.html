I usually live in Florida (although I have been staying in Oklahoma City for
<br>
the last few months).
<br>
<p>Florida cops still use racial profiling to randomly stop and search cars on
<br>
I-95.  People are still fighting this, and the cops are still fighting to
<br>
continue this strategy.  They argue that since most drug dealers are
<br>
non-white, that cops should be targeting non-whites for random searches.
<br>
(And yes, we have random roadblocks and searches without warrants, but don't
<br>
ask me how this is legal.)
<br>
<p>We also have a lot of English-language bigotry here.  People are still
<br>
trying to pass laws making it illegal to teach people in their native
<br>
language, do business in their native language or even to allow cops or
<br>
government workers to perform investigations in languages other than
<br>
English.  Some have even suggested that cops should be instructed to shoot
<br>
people who don't obey their commands, and if it turns out that they don't
<br>
speak English, it is their own fault.
<br>
<p>We also still have racial shootings, drive-bys, and yes, even a few reports
<br>
of crosses burned on people's front lawns every year.  I agree that racism
<br>
is not as much of a problem as it once was, but there is no doubt in my mind
<br>
that it still exists.
