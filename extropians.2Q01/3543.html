<p>I would rather remain interesting by increasing in my own intelligence

and understanding rather than keeping the AI dumb enough to wish to talk

to me. :-)

<p><p><em>&gt; This is reminiscent of the situation in &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot;, in which not

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are possible reasons that I don't gainsay to choose that way. 
<br>
Assuming that the pace of change toward Singularity is actually
<br>
controllable in the first place of course.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Or one can imagine &quot;bodhisattva AI's&quot; that become superintelligent and then
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't believe stupidity is required for the job.  Perhaps limiting
<br>
one's focus for a time is. 
<br>

<em>&gt; When I was younger and even more foolish, I used to have a theory that I was

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being so damn powerful  ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I had the theory that I was a transplant from a much more advanced
<br>
civilization starting when I was about four.  I used to call out
<br>
mentally for my true people to come and take me away from this madhouse
<br>
of a world.  But, of course, they never did.  Now and then I would dream
<br>
of this other world during my childhood.  Sometimes I would wake up and
<br>
spend a long time searching my bed for one of my favorite things from
<br>
the other world that I had in my dreams but was gone when I awoke.  Like
<br>
the magic small box (but not magic in the dream any more than a faucet
<br>
is magic).  If I directed a thought at the box then out of it would come
<br>
whatever I pictured.  That one was so achingly real that it really upset
<br>
me that I did not have it in this *real* world. 
<br>
<p>I remember when I first learned the word &quot;omniscient&quot;.  I thought that
<br>
was a reasonable goal to aim for.  :-)
