<p><em>&gt;&quot;So the more we want our descendants to be rich, the more we should hope

</em><br>
<p>Pessimistic but possibly true .... except that different commodities
<br>
have different value depending on history and circumstance. Ancient
<br>
Incas might have had plenty gold, but we might call them &quot;poor.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I show in my paper that at least one of the following is true:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;1. The probability that we will never become posthuman is approximately
</em><br>
one.
<br>
<p>This builds in too many assumptions. I for one think we already
<br>
*are* posthuman, but not all of us realise it.
<br>
<p>Nick seems to follow the &quot;posthuman must be entirely alien&quot; school
<br>
of thought ....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2. The fraction of posthuman civilizations that contain individuals who run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plenty of ancestor-simulations is very close to zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3. The probability that we are in a simulation is close to one.
</em><br>
<p>Our perception is 'virtual' rather than 'real' in that our brains
<br>
reinterpret
<br>
signals (light image hitting our retina is upside-down, we invert the
<br>
image psychologically to see the world right side up). So we &quot;are in a
<br>
simulation&quot;in this sense ..... but I suspect Nick means something like we
<br>
are characters in a computer game or similar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So we should hope for either 2 or 3. Since there seems a good likelihood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that simulators will often terminate simulations when they become expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(i.e. when they become posthuman), the best scenario would be 2. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entails a strong convergence hypothesis, where practically all posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilizations lose a typical human motivation.
</em><br>
<p>But logically I feel  Nick is *wrong* ... since he fails to omit 4. That we
<br>
could be the ancestors leading the original lives on which any future
<br>
simulations are based!!!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One conclusion that I draw is that the naive transhumanist dogma that we or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our descendants will become posthumans who'll run ancestor-simulations is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;false. This hypothesis has a negligible probability, unfortunately.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily ... see point 4.
