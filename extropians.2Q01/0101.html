This is a review of Wallace Kaufman's new book, a pointer to which Larry 
<br>
Klaes passed on in the transhumantech list.  Kaufman's earlier work, &quot;No 
<br>
Turning Back&quot; may be the best book on environmentalism and questions of 
<br>
humanity's relationship to the non-human world I have ever read (by a great 
<br>
margin).  I look forward to reading his new book.

On the contrary, Mr. Thoreau 
<br>
<p>By Chet Raymo, Globe Correspondent, 2/27/2001 
<br>
<p>''In wildness is the preservation of the world,'' wrote Henry David Thoreau 
<br>
in one of his more self-indulgent moments, and environmentalists never tire 
<br>
of quoting him. Into the woods, they urge. Into the woods. That's where we'll 
<br>
find our salvation.
<br>
<p>Not in science or technology. No, no. They are the enemy. It's wildness that 
<br>
will save us from ourselves, restore us to our primeval wisdom, discipline 
<br>
our hubris, chasten our sins.
<br>
<p>Of course, Thoreau lived in a landscape that was anything but wild. The 
<br>
Fitchburg Railroad ran along the banks of Walden Pond, for heaven's sake. 
<br>
''Hope and the future for me are not in lawns and cultivated fields, not in 
<br>
towns and cities, but in the impervious and quaking swamps,'' he wrote, but 
<br>
he was glad to get back to good old civilized Concord after a sojourn in the 
<br>
Maine woods.
<br>
<p>Never mind. Betake us to the quaking swamps, say the Thoreauvian 
<br>
environmentalists, back to the impervious woods. Let us live like our 
<br>
hunter-gatherer ancestors, in harmony with the land and other creatures. Let 
<br>
us become dryads and naiads, gentle spirits of tree and brook, taking 
<br>
nothing, leaving only footprints - and not too many of those.
<br>
<p>''We have built a greenhouse, a human creation, where once there bloomed a 
<br>
sweet and wild garden,'' laments Bill McKibben in his influential ''The End 
<br>
of Nature.'' McKibben is a man of unimpeachable principle, and I wouldn't 
<br>
want to live in a world without him, but his sweet wild garden never existed, 
<br>
and if it did, the only way back is for 6 billion or so human beings to 
<br>
commit mass suicide.
<br>
<p>How refreshing, then, to have a book called ''Coming Out of the Woods,'' by 
<br>
an environmentalist who doesn't look at the wild through rose-colored 
<br>
glasses. Wallace Kaufman sought his own little Walden, his own place in the 
<br>
woods. His experience there is a bracing antidote to those who believe that 
<br>
wilderness is an Eden that we messed up.
<br>
<p>In the late 1960s, inspired by the first great flowering of green politics, 
<br>
Kaufman bought 360 acres of forested land in North Carolina with the idea of 
<br>
creating a whole community of little Waldens, including one for himself.
<br>
<p>He built a road into the forest, doing his best to save the fine old trees, 
<br>
then wrote covenants for prospective purchasers that would keep the place 
<br>
wild - no chemical pesticides or serious tree-cutting, that sort of thing. 
<br>
Soon he was the ''mayor of Hippie Town,'' according to the folks in nearby 
<br>
Pittsboro and Chapel Hill.
<br>
<p>On his own corner of the 360 acres, he built a house and settled in. Like 
<br>
Thoreau, he went into the woods ''to live deliberately,'' communing with 
<br>
nature, washing his spirit in the wild - and he stayed 15 times longer than 
<br>
Thoreau resided at Walden. Indeed, he's still there.
<br>
<p>It would be a shame to spoil the reading of this wise and funny book by 
<br>
retelling Kaufman's adventures. Suffice it to say that Thoreau and Kaufman 
<br>
had a loving but troubled relationship in the North Carolina woods. Green 
<br>
politics met practical realities, and what came out of the clash was less 
<br>
quaking swamp than quaking principles.
<br>
<p>Sweet and wild garden? Try copperheads in the crawl space, squirrels in the 
<br>
eaves, and deer in the bean patch. Kaufman tried his best to accommodate them 
<br>
all, but found that human interests and natural instincts don't always mesh. 
<br>
And then came Hurricane Fran, roaring up his valley and knocking down all 
<br>
those grand old trees he had tried so hard to protect.
<br>
<p>''Nature had been no kinder to this forest than God was to Job,'' Kaufman 
<br>
muses, unromantically. ''She would as soon make maggot meat out of a squishy 
<br>
little human being as offer him or her a fine view.''
<br>
<p>And now, with a new administration in Washington, we can expect increased 
<br>
pressure on the few remaining ''wild'' places where the touch of the human 
<br>
hand is light - the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, for example, or the 
<br>
not-so-quaking swamps of the Everglades. How can we best resist these 
<br>
pressures? Not by romanticizing wilderness, or by invoking the sentiments of 
<br>
hunter-gatherer societies, but by drawing upon our own most civilized 
<br>
instincts.
<br>
<p>This is the lesson of Kaufman's experience: ''Nowhere is nature a Garden of 
<br>
Eden. Whenever consciousness dawned in the human brain, our ancestors found 
<br>
themselves in a wilderness. They set about conquering its dangers. They began 
<br>
to reshape it with Eden as their model. They knew, in those days before 
<br>
romantic illusions, that if nature was ever to be a friend to humankind, they 
<br>
would have to command it to be so.''
<br>
<p>We did not come from Eden, Kaufman says, but we can go there. With wisdom, 
<br>
humility, optimism and restraint, we can devise a world in which humans and 
<br>
the wild achieve some sort of accommodation - a beautiful dominion. Science 
<br>
and technology can - and must - be part of the equation. Thoreau had it 
<br>
backwards: In civilization is the preservation of the wild.
