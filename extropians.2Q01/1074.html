<p>Excellent rejoinder Samantha!  While I appreciate the appeal of
<br>
Eli's moral position (conscious beings have equal rights), it can be
<br>
turned around so that the children enslave the parents if they
<br>
are granted too many rights.  Eli seems to be migrating towards
<br>
an environment in which the creation of conscious beings without
<br>
full rights is impossible.  [I guess I would equate this with
<br>
birth control at the level of the dark matter...]
<br>
<p>[Its useful to note that we have parallels of the future &quot;positions&quot;
<br>
within current &quot;positions&quot; today.]
<br>
<p>Your bringing in the &quot;creator&quot; vs. &quot;createe&quot; positions must ultimately
<br>
be reconciled with perspectives our society has.  While I may be
<br>
responsible for my children and even liable for their acts, the law
<br>
recognizes that at some point they mature becoming &quot;free agents&quot;.
<br>
Now, as far as I can tell in the SysOp moral framework you are simply
<br>
disallowed those nights when the drugstore was all out of condoms
<br>
and risky behavior paths were followed.  You never get to create
<br>
&quot;free agents&quot;, what you create is always dependent on you.  This
<br>
seems to be a contradiction of the concept that if they are a copy
<br>
of you (running on a somewhat slower implementation) they should
<br>
by the &quot;consciousness&quot; == &quot;consciousness&quot; argument be free agents
<br>
as well.  I.e. if they can't figure out how to prevent me from
<br>
recycling their computronium -- *on their own* -- then I am free to
<br>
do so.
<br>
<p>Interestingly enought this creates an interesting new legal
<br>
principle -- the justifiability of a createe killing the
<br>
creator (god) if it was about to erase it.  Self-defense
<br>
between equally conscious beings is justifiable.  Now one
<br>
can of course argue that the sim is less conscious because
<br>
it cannot run as fast as the non-sim.
<br>
<p>This is going to get dicey my friends very very dicey.
