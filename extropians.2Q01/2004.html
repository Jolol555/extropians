<em>&gt; Thanks Gene.  These sites confirmed some of the things I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had recalled about the chicken cannon: that the birds were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propelled by compressed air, and that the gun looks an awful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot like something that would come off a battleship...
</em><br>
<p>There is another possibility that came to mind as I recalled my
<br>
trip up to the north range at China Lake to the chicken cannon
<br>
site.  That being the Mojave Desert, it would often get ghastly hot
<br>
up there.  Most of our crew would scatter like rabbits when
<br>
there was a job to do on those ranges in the summertime, but
<br>
they knew I looooved going up on the range, I was such a whore
<br>
for airplanes and weird stuff.  When it was over 110 degrees F, the
<br>
testers might have gotten sloppy  (that being an outdoor facility)
<br>
and rushed the procedure.  They may have had the chicken
<br>
out of the freezer for insufficient time, so that the outside was
<br>
thawed but the inside was still frozen enough to be quite
<br>
destructive to an experimental canopy.   spike
