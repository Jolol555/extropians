<p>Some things that amused me,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Society will come to a collective realization that
<br>
technology is a natural fit only for some tasks.&quot;  (Star Lab's
<br>
prediction for 2001.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Plazas, town squares, and other public spaces will be
<br>
reinvented to include interactive digital-art installations.&quot;
<br>
(Xerox PARC's prediction for 2010.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Rich Gold*, manager of the *Research in Experimental
<br>
Documents* lab at Xerox PARC and inventor of *Little Computer
<br>
People* on the Commodore 64 has developed a reading assistant
<br>
for the *visually impaired* that *looks like a dog*!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Richard Wheeler of Star Lab on-line grocery
<br>
shopping and e-books make no &quot;inherent sense&quot; whereas
<br>
&quot;clothing that incorporates electronics to alert wearers if
<br>
they forget their car keys&quot; will be all the rage!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article seems like it's going to end well, &quot;Professor
<br>
Brooks sees more and more people accepting robotics into their
<br>
bodies. 'Just as there are cochlear implants for deaf people
<br>
now which are experimental, by 2010, procedures like these
<br>
will be clinical and not just used to fix parts of us that
<br>
don't work, but rather to enhance our bodies' performance,' he
<br>
says.&quot;  But then, &quot;Brooks say the issues these developments
<br>
will bring up will make the social quandaries surrounding
<br>
abortion seem simple.&quot;  Personally, I don't think the question
<br>
of whether I should be able to run faster, jump higher, or
<br>
think smarter, is anything like the moral dilemma involved in
<br>
abortion.  Better is better.  The only thing that could
<br>
possibly go wrong is you ban enhancements and end up with
<br>
supercriminals but no supercops or supercitizens.
