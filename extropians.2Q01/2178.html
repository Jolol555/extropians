Researchers Find Stem Cells in Human Fat
<br>
<p>By Kevin Krolicki
<br>
Reuters
<br>
<p>LOS ANGELES (April 10) - Your love handles might someday save a life.
<br>
<p>Researchers at UCLA and the University of Pittsburgh say they have isolated 
<br>
human stem cells from fat sucked out of patients during routine liposuctions.
<br>
<p>That finding opens the prospect of a more abundant supply of the cells, which 
<br>
are needed for promising medical research, and drawn from the same fat many 
<br>
Americans would be more than happy to donate in the name of science.
<br>
<p>''Fat is perhaps the ideal source,'' said Dr. Marc Hedrick, a UCLA plastic 
<br>
surgeon and one of the researchers on the project. ''There's plenty of it. 
<br>
It's easy and inexpensive to obtain. It even has a secondary cosmetic 
<br>
benefit.''
<br>
<p>Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to become anything in the 
<br>
body from nerves to bone to muscle. Because of their unique power to develop 
<br>
into all kinds of tissue, researchers are examining them for potential use in 
<br>
treating a wide range of diseases.
<br>
<p>Researchers say stem cells, which were first isolated just over two years 
<br>
ago, have the potential to grow new heart muscles for people with cardiac 
<br>
disease, new insulin-producing cells for those with diabetes and even new 
<br>
nerve tissue for those suffering from spinal injuries or Parkinson's or 
<br>
Alzheimer's diseases.
<br>
<p>Until now, however, one of the major problems has been the relative scarcity 
<br>
of human stem cells for testing and the medical and ethical controversy 
<br>
surrounding their best-known sources.
<br>
<p>Stem cells develop in the first stages of human life when they form a kind of 
<br>
biological blank slate. Early research looked at embryonic tissue obtained 
<br>
from fertility clinics, but abortion opponents have challenged the morality 
<br>
of such experiments on the basis that life begins at conception.
<br>
<p>President George W. Bush has stated his opposition to embryonic stem cell 
<br>
research, and his administration is reviewing whether to block federal 
<br>
funding for it, a step that has drawn a counter-plea from 80 U.S. Nobel 
<br>
laureates.
<br>
<p>With that debate still raging, the potential to draw stem-like cells from fat 
<br>
opens a new channel, especially given that there are 600,000 liposuctions a 
<br>
year in the United States, researchers said.
<br>
<p>''We don't yet know the limits for stem cells found in fat,'' said Dr. Adam 
<br>
Katz, a plastic surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh. ''This discovery 
<br>
could potentially obviate the need for using fetal tissue.''
<br>
<p>Or, as Patricia Zuk, a University of California at Los Angeles postdoctoral 
<br>
researcher said, ''I'm sure there would be a lot of people willing to donate 
<br>
fat.''
<br>
<p>MILLIONS OF STEM-LIKE CELLS IN HALF POUND OF FAT
<br>
<p>In the experiment, detailed in the April issue of the medical journal Tissue 
<br>
Engineering, the scientists took the fat and fluid sucked from the hips, 
<br>
buttocks and stomachs of patients during elective liposuction surgery.
<br>
<p>That material was then washed and purified, treated with an enzyme to break 
<br>
down the matrix holding cells together and compared with the stem cells 
<br>
obtained from bone marrow samples.
<br>
<p>The result: researchers found that a half-pound (0.24 kg) or so of fatty 
<br>
material could yield as much as 50 million to 100 million undifferentiated 
<br>
stem-like cells, Zuk said.
<br>
<p>Researchers said those cells appeared to have the potential to grow into 
<br>
bone, fat, cartilage or muscle tissue over time. Experiments at UCLA were 
<br>
under way to see if the cells could be used to grow human bone and fat tissue 
<br>
in mice, Hedrick said.
<br>
<p>Hedrick, who was set to perform another liposuction on Tuesday, said the 
<br>
findings should cause people to begin to to see ''unwanted fat as a vigorous 
<br>
tissue with a tremendous potential for good.''
<br>
<p>''It's not just that spare tire that we're all looking to get rid of,'' he 
<br>
said.
