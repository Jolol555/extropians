FALLACY DETECTED: 
<br>
First define &quot;humility&quot;. What observable criteria can you give for it?
<br>
Why &quot;should&quot; such a universal triviality entice any &quot;humility&quot;?
<br>
Are you displaying any &quot;humility&quot; with regards to your own opinions? how so?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; converts are often the most fervent evangelists.
</em><br>
Again, so what? Yet another triviality.
<br>
Yes, people with strong opinions have strong opinions.
<br>
Besides, considering that one starts with no opinion whatsoever,
<br>
what do you call &quot;convert&quot;? Someone who's gone through some
<br>
major internal change in opinions? Shrug.
<br>
I don't feel I had any major change in my core beliefs;
<br>
rather, I discovered very late a tradition where my core beliefs
<br>
would fit perfectly, even though I had to reform many prejudices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I can't show why my ethical beliefs are better than anybody else's,
</em><br>

</em><br>
Which means &quot;I renounce to use reason in discussing beliefs,

and am ready to push my opinions by sheer violence when reason fails&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe I just don't like exploitation, genocide, etc.,
</em><br>

</em><br>
Yet your meta-ideology is precisely what justifies the violence

behind exploitation, genocide, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; So yes, my opinions are somehow the fruit of my past of being confronted

FALLACY DETECTED: APPEAL TO EMOTION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-emotion.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-emotion.html</a>
<br>
<p>Who talks about feelings? Why put feelings forward?
<br>
What are their relevance? None.
<br>
Replacing rational arguments with emotional stances
<br>
is typical leftist rubbish. You're just escaping the issue.
<br>
As said a famous french politician to another one:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vous n'avez pas le monopole du coeur&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(you do not have a monopoly on heart)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the degree to which you disagree with your parents and school about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics was an indicator of the degree to which reason guides your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics, skinhead Nazis would be the most reasonable of all.
</em><br>
FALLACIES DETECTED: STRAW MAN, GUILT BY ASSOCIATION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/straw-man.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/guilt-by-association.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/guilt-by-association.html</a>
<br>
<p>No one ever argued this silly thing you say.
<br>
My argument is that, among all environments in which someone can be educated,
<br>
some are more conducive to the use of reason, particularly ones where
<br>
you are simultaneously faced with a wide variety of contradictory theses,
<br>
none of which are imposed to you out of authority albeit most
<br>
being imposed to their respective tenants with the same authority,
<br>
whereas you are taught the basic principles of critical thinking,
<br>
are trained to read original texts before to make your opinion,
<br>
yet are encouraged to make your own opinion, and have to argue it rationally
<br>
with a wide variety of bright people of varying opinions themselves.
<br>
My breedings may have lacked in many ways, but certainly not in the ways
<br>
of teaching me critical rational thinking.
<br>
<p>I also tried to counter your narrow determinism in which you seemed to argue
<br>
that one would naturally or even rationally follow the opinions of those
<br>
with whom one shared an emotional background. You are but cautioning
<br>
emotional thinking, as opposed to rational thinking.
<br>
<p>Additionally, there's no evidence either that skinhead Nazis react mainly
<br>
by rejecting parents and school, or that most people who reject parents
<br>
and school end up skinhead Nazis. You win a Godwin point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; But there is no certainty in values or politics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Here's a loathable self-defeating statement.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, there are some wonderful French philosophers
</em><br>
FALLACY DETECTED: APPEAL TO AUTHORITY
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.html</a>
<br>
<p>So what? Are you invoking some argument of authority?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I could recommend you read, such as Camus, Foucault
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Lyotard, but I suppose you probably already have.
</em><br>
I like Camus, but he doesn't have much of a philosophy, just a tiny but
<br>
strong core thereof, with a few good intuitions and rejection of some
<br>
fallacies. Foucault is very bright, but his system of values is deeply skewed.
<br>
I haven't read Lyotard, but from what I've heard he seems even
<br>
worse than Foucault. Of course, if you have any particular text to recommend
<br>
(if possible on the net), then go ahead and recommend it.
<br>
<p>If you like french thinkers, I'd rather recommend Turgot, Tocqueville,
<br>
Bastiat, Alain, Jouvenel, Fourastié, Ruyer, Revel; (there are also
<br>
Voltaire, Condorcet, Constant, Say, Molinari, Taine, Renan, Faguet, Aron,
<br>
although I have read too little significant texts by them to comment).
<br>
Why choose inferior philosophers of little worth, when you can have real ones?
<br>
And if you want only three, whose works I know sufficiently enough,
<br>
let me pick Bastiat, Fourastié, Revel.
<br>
<p>I really don't know what your argument was worth, what it was supposed
<br>
to suggest or induce, but if you're consistent, then I suppose my
<br>
counter-list of french thinkers should suggest or induce that thing to you.
<br>
<p>Oh, to be sure that it has the intended effect, let's not forget to add
<br>
the little snide remark: but I suppose you probably already have read them.
<br>
FALLACY DETECTED: APPEAL TO RIDICULE
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-ridicule.html">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-ridicule.html</a>
<br>
<p>Apart from that, I don't see much relevance
<br>
in the fact that philosophers be french or not french.
<br>
Despite your claims of the contrary, you are a racist!
<br>
<p>Some good philosophers I like of many nationalities, many of whose ideas
<br>
I have selected after critical thinking:
<br>
Lao Tse, Darwin, Russell, Ferrero, Rand, Hayek, Popper, Einstein,
<br>
Wiener, Hazlitt, Havel, Sagan, Chaitin, Dawkins, Hofstadter, Dennett.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but the Ought is always, at root, a leap of faith.
</em><br>
No, it isn't.
<br>
It's written all over in nature in HUGE LETTERS.
<br>
The name is natural selection.
<br>
And it also shaped instinct and tradition,
<br>
so you never have to leap, since the answer
<br>
has most often been given to you already,
<br>
although it didn't use rational thinking until very recently,
<br>
so the traditions aren't fully selected yet
<br>
as far as this dimension is concerned
<br>
(but it is not very hard to operate this selection by yourself).
<br>
<p>Some good etext on ethics: Henry Hazlitt's &quot;The Foundations of Morality&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/morality/">http://www.hazlitt.org/e-texts/morality/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you have an airtight reason why your idea about the Good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is better than mine, I'd love to hear it.
</em><br>
If you think that everything is equivalent,
<br>
let me suggest that you commit suicide.
<br>
It won't be worse according to your non-values,
<br>
and it will be better according to people with values:
<br>
It will rid the world from a dangerous relativist.
<br>
Plus it might make a very funny Darwin Award.
<br>
Even better, of course, would be that you drop your silly relativism,
<br>
since objectivism (no, not Objectivism: objectivism)
<br>
is at least as true as relativism according to relativism itself.
<br>
<p>Your principles are self-defeating. They negate reason. Ultimately,
<br>
they but justify affirmation of gratuitous opinions through violence.

Philosophy is questions that may never be answered.

Religion is answers that may never be questioned.
