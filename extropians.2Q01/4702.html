<br>
<p>Naw, some of the few regulars there are worth talking to. Before anyone
<br>
wants to check it out: don't do it. It's not worth even a minute of your time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and jumping in myself having a great time. It was wonderful. Well, I went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back and when I got on the channel again, there was a strange silence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went on many mins. I then tried to spur things on by trying to discuss the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent AI developments I knew about. At once, I was attacked by people...
</em><br>
<p>What a major faux pas to make.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not with arguments, but completely unexpected responses, most saying &quot;go

<p>I'm not sure whether you realize how abusive current IRC culture (well, okay)
<br>
is. I'm not sure whether this always was so, I remember checking out IRC
<br>
at about a time when SGI Indys were pretty new, and immediately leaving in
<br>
disgust. What an awful waste of human life.
<br>
<p>As a newbie, or a supposed newbie one is expected to join quietly, sit
<br>
there and listen to the Great Ones (even if the current Great Ones consist
<br>
of a couple of 11 year old channel ops who're waiting for an excuse to exercise
<br>
their newly won or hijacked 4wsum p0wrz), and then go through the usual 
<br>
hazing and grovelling act.
<br>
<p>Even if you're a regular, there's often a flurry of bans and kickbans
<br>
going on. Gossips, remote love affairs which surprisingly frequently 
<br>
go physical space, attacks, channel takeovers, remote exploits, DoS, etc.
<br>
<p>In other words, plenty of monkey business. Sociologists would be in
<br>
hog heaven. I've never ran into some, though, maybe they were among
<br>
the few iron lurkers.
<br>
<p>However, quite a few of the channels are veritable pockets of civility
<br>
(ironly enforced by the local vigilante posse, and unaccessibility of the topic
<br>
to the average IRC luser).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; approach the subject so me and him/her chatted away a few while the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people took shots at me. The conversation led into more generalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological developments and as soon as I mentioned the recent time travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility that just popped up, I was immediately disconnected by the Op
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and BANNED!!! Have things gone so far that the average person cant stand to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even hear a potential breakthrough?! Or should I just chalk this up as the
</em><br>
<p>No, and in fact going through the usual motions one can get people talking
<br>
pretty quickly, but it is awfully mindnumbing. Don't do it, unless
<br>
one is handicapped and limited to this mode of communication (then, IRC
<br>
can be a remarkably good idea, it's the modern (well, not so modern,
<br>
the vogue now seems to be instant messaging and SMS) equivalent of citizens
<br>
band radio and HAM).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; unwashed masses have finally arrived and I was just expecting a bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from them? I can see this coming from a channel like #hottub or #partyzone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I get this response from the great intellectuals on the #philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channel? What do we do with all these crazy people!!!!?
</em><br>
<p>Great intellectuals on an IRC channel? IRC was never great even when
<br>
it was invented. It only went downhill since.
