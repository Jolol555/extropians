</em><br>
<p>Oh.  Well, in *that* case...  ^_^
<br>
<p>As before, plus:
<br>
<p>* Use something with *far* higher specific impulse (probably one of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;new generation&quot; thrusters, rather than explosives, partly so that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you don't run the risk of an engine fault blowing up your vehicle),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;enough that you can do a powered abort from any point in the launch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sequence.
<br>
* 100% fly-by-wire.
<br>
* Tailless plus thicker wings if you can get away with it: non-cargo,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;non-cockpit bits can be put in the wings.
<br>
* Maybe go for windowless &quot;glass cockpit&quot;, to improve shielding and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aerodynamics.  Split pilot and copilot between the wings, so as to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;use the entire central body for cargo and surround them with more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;displays.  Make *very* certain to have redundant and reliable cameras
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all over the vehicle's exterior, since this does dispose of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;windows.
<br>
* Horizontal takeoff and landing, such that it can use and be serviced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;at commercial airports (renting hangar space at which is far cheaper
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;than renting or owning special spaceports; this also provides a far
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;larger number of possible landing and launch sites, and a path for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;airlines to incorporate this vehicle into their fleets, thus
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;providing a significant market for volume production - and cheaper
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;incremental improvement/development - of the vehicles after the first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;few enter into service for the initial developer).
<br>
* Better (lighter/stronger) structural materials, possibly composites.
<br>
* Just to one-up the shuttle, enlarge the cargo volume slightly - only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an extra half meter or so in diameter, enough that people can design
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;satellites to this vehicle's specs rather than the shuttle's.  (Say,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;spy satellites, whose accuracy is limited by the diameter of their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lens.)
<br>
* No explosive bolts.  No explosives anywhere on the craft.  To the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;greatest extent possible, all parts designed to be useable again and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;again, rather than only once, and thus more likely to work right when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;they are used - even if no one ever services them.  (Which means
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;people don't have to service them ever, which drives down maintenance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;costs.)
<br>
* All electric if possible, or at least heavily favoring electric
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;motors and actuators as the primary means of translating control
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;signals into action.  (Electric vehicles, at least on sea and land,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have proven to need far less maintenance than just about any other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;type of high-performance vehicle, primarily because they use less
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;parts - thus, less things that can break during use, less things to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;fit together during design, and less things to check when prepping
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the vehicle for use.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  Much the same, but fully RLV - no external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tanks or external solid boosters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Which is the effort that was just declared a failure, the Venture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Star/X34.  The technology to do a fully recoverable just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isnt quite there yet, or at least not as a single stage to orbit.
</em><br>
<p>Fully recoverable with standard fuels, yes.  One of the main causes
<br>
appears to be the high mass fraction incurred by such.  Note what NASA
<br>
is shifting the former Venture Star/X34 funding to.  An argument could
<br>
also be made that the contractors building the Venture Star/X34 had a
<br>
financial interest in failure of same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [a bunch of good ideas snipped]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They say you can't argue with success.  I say you can improve on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hope so.  {8-]  spike
</em><br>
<p>This goes beyond theoretical for me, actually.  I'm trying to see how
<br>
it would be possible to really build one.  Two main problems come up:
<br>
<p>1. Engine tech - RLVs appear possible with today's technology, save for
<br>
one element: far better rocket engines than the explosive fuels in use
<br>
today.  Thus, an effective RLV development plan necessarily includes
<br>
development of said better engine.  Plasma is the primary candidate I'm
<br>
investigating, but not the only one.  (This includes power sources,
<br>
since a number of the promising candidates require having a lot of
<br>
electrical power on the vehicle itself for the engine to use;
<br>
transmission from outside runs into problems with, among other things,
<br>
using commercial airports.)  I may have to build this myself, though I
<br>
suspect there may be groups already working with similar devices that I
<br>
can pay to build it for me, and probably do a far better job of it than
<br>
I could...but I have to find them before I can ask.
<br>
<p>2. Funding - I'm not a millionaire.  If I can get a decent RLV dev plan
<br>
together, I may be able to weave it into a business plan and get VC or
<br>
angel money, but I need to find out the order of magnitude cost for
<br>
each element of that plan.  (Of course, if I can get this effort off
<br>
the ground, so to speak, I may well become a millionaire once this hits
<br>
volume production.  However, getting the technology into public use is
<br>
more important, to me, than fame and fortune - but driving this myself
<br>
may be the only way to get it done, given as most/all of the other
<br>
efforts seem stuck on using existing engine tech.  I could be wrong
<br>
about the necessity of that - but, if I am, then there are enough
<br>
people trying to make RLVs with the older engines that someone is
<br>
likely to suceed if it is possible, so I'd be wasting my time using the
<br>
older tech anyway.)  So far, the most promising model seems to be if I
<br>
can act as a coordinator between the groups developing each part of
<br>
the puzzle, but many investors might see said plan, wonder what I'm
<br>
contributing, and try to run it themselves - and, driven by short-term
<br>
greed more than desire to develop cheap space access, fail to satisfy
<br>
either goal.
<br>
<p>I've been working on these for a while, and I probably will continue to
<br>
work on these for some time.
