Charlie had forwarded:
<br>
<em>&gt; See <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,476639,00.html">http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,476639,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Analyses of IQ tests show that people are getting rapidly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intelligent, or at least getting higher scores. Average scores have risen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by 27 points in the UK since 1942 and 24 points in the US since 1918,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with comparable gains across the world. This so-called 'Flynn effect',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;first discovered in 1987, has until now baffled psychologists. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a study in the Psychological Review of the American Psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Association claims that a more stimulating environment and genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;inheritance interact in a virtuous circle to make people far smarter. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;authors, Bill Dickens and James Flynn (who first discovered the effect),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reckon the rise is partly caused by improved education.
</em><br>
<p>One thing I wanted to mention is that it is encouraging that Flynn himself
<br>
apparently now takes his eponymous Effect seriously.  When he first wrote
<br>
about it, he believed that the effect was not real.  Bizarrely, he had
<br>
his students go through the newspaper to see if there was evidence for an
<br>
increase in genius in the human race.  They couldn't find any (despite the
<br>
evidence being at hand at every point IMO, the fish not seeing the water).
<br>
<p>He suggested that we were seeing not an actual increase in intelligence,
<br>
but an increase in some mental skill which is measured by the IQ test
<br>
but which is not the same as intelligence.  This mental ability would
<br>
correlate with intelligence in a cross-sectional comparison (i.e. in any
<br>
given year that the test is administered), so it had always appeared that
<br>
the IQ test actually measured intelligence.  However he proposed that
<br>
this mental ability had improved over the years without a corresponding
<br>
increase in intelligence, making cross-generational IQ comparisons
<br>
meaningless.
<br>
<p>This did not sound very plausible and seemed more like an attempt to
<br>
soften the counter-intuitive nature of his result.  Perhaps with the
<br>
passage of years, the data has come to seem more familiar and therefore
<br>
less threatening, and he is now willing to accept it at face value.
