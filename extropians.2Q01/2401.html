<p>&quot;His mother would be back from Boston by now, had to be, or else
<br>
she'd miss one of her favorite soaps. New hole in her head. She
<br>
was crazy anyway, nothing wrong with the socket she'd had
<br>
since before he was born, but she'd been whining for years
<br>
about static and resolution and sensory bleedover, so she'd
<br>
finally swung the credit to go to Boston for some cheapass
<br>
replacement. Kind of place where you don't even get an
<br>
appointment for an operation. Walk in and they just slap it in
<br>
your head. . . . He knew her, yeah, how she'd come through
<br>
the door with a wrapped bottle under her arm, not even take
<br>
her coat off, just go straight over and jack into the Hitachi,
<br>
soap her brains out good for six solid hours. Her eyes would
<br>
unfocus, and sometimes, if it was a really good episode
<br>
she'd drool a little.&quot;
