<em>&gt;Same here, particularly considering I'm going back to my country after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;graduation, and try my humblest best to keep the ship from sinking.
</em><br>
<p>Please do!   (I like your country's writers. :-) )
<br>
<p>I was under the impression that life was improving in Argentina, but
<br>
perhaps I was wrong. The last few years have been difficult there.

<p>(I suppose the following is reasonably accurate (?).   )

<br>
<p>Economy - overview: Argentina benefits from rich natural resources,
<br>
a highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural
<br>
sector, and a diversified industrial base. However, when President
<br>
Carlos MENEM took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge
<br>
external debts, inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was
<br>
plummeting. To combat the economic crisis, the government embarked
<br>
on a path of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization.
<br>
In 1991, it implemented radical monetary reforms which pegged the
<br>
peso to the US dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base by
<br>
law to the growth in reserves. Inflation fell sharply in subsequent
<br>
years. In 1995, the Mexican peso crisis produced capital flight, the
<br>
loss of banking system deposits, and a severe, but short-lived,
<br>
recession; a series of reforms to bolster the domestic banking
<br>
system followed. Real GDP growth recovered strongly, reaching 8% in
<br>
1997. In 1998, international financial turmoil caused by Russia's
<br>
problems and increasing investor anxiety over Brazil produced the
<br>
highest domestic interest rates in more than three years, halving
<br>
the growth rate of the economy. Conditions worsened in 1999 with GDP
<br>
falling by 3%. President Fernando DE LA RUA, who took office in
<br>
December 1999, sponsored tax increases and spending cuts to reduce
<br>
the deficit, which had ballooned to 2.5% of GDP in 1999. The new
<br>
government also arranged a new $7.4 billion stand-by facility with
<br>
the IMF for contingency purposes - almost three times the size of
<br>
the previous arrangement. Key challenges facing the new government
<br>
include reforming the country's rigid labor code and addressing the
<br>
precarious financial situation of several highly indebted provinces.
