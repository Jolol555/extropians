<p><em>&gt; Several people have suggested that our world is indistinguishable from a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; closely at all) it's simple.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I have to differ with Curt and agree with Eliezer here.
<br>
<p>For example, I had the opportunity to overhear a conversation between
<br>
Deepak Shrivistava (a scientist who actually does molecular simulations
<br>
(of buckytubes) and knows those who do the &quot;really&quot; big simulations)
<br>
and Robert Freitas at the Foresight nanotech conference last fall.
<br>
Deepak indicated that there was a big difference in simulation capacity
<br>
depending on whether or not you need to put the hydrogen atoms into
<br>
the simulation.  This make sense because hydrogen atoms are the
<br>
smallest and have the highest velocities.  So while the simulation
<br>
might be able to operate at several nanosecond time steps without
<br>
the H atoms, do one with the H atoms in it and you have to crank it
<br>
down to sub-ns time steps.  (Obviously in biological material simulations
<br>
the H atoms are important while in semiconductor material simulations
<br>
they are much less important.)
<br>
<p>Now the interesting thing is that the &quot;resolution&quot; of the simulation
<br>
remains the same whether you are running it on a PC or a supercomputer.
<br>
(The code is the same after all).  What changes is the ratio of real
<br>
time to simulation time.  If we are in the simulation the SI could be
<br>
dynamically adding and removing processors devoted to running it,
<br>
speeding it up and slowing it down and this would be totally undetectable
<br>
from our perspective.
<br>
<p>Simulations do not &quot;have&quot; to simplify things to the point where they can
<br>
be detected (it may be cost effective to do that).  But if they want to
<br>
devote enough resources to creating the complexity required &quot;on demand&quot;
<br>
they should make it extraordinarily difficult, perhaps impossible, for
<br>
us to tell the difference.  It isn't clear to me, if as we move to the
<br>
theoretical limits of physical laws, whether the creation could develop
<br>
incongruities that would cause us to become very suspicious.  Maybe
<br>
that should be a topic for Extro 6.
