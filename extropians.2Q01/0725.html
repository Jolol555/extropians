<br>
<p>Cass Sunstein is the Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service 
<br>
Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago Law School 
<br>
and Department of Political Science. A former law clerk for Justice 
<br>
Thurgood Marshall, he has worked for the Office of Legal Counsel in 
<br>
the US Department of Justice.
<br>
<p>His former works include: &quot;Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech&quot; 
<br>
(1993), which won the Goldsmith Prize from Harvard for the best book 
<br>
on free speech in that year. &quot;After the Rights Revolution&quot; (1990), 
<br>
&quot;The Partial Constitution&quot; (1993), &quot;Free Markets and Social Justice&quot; 
<br>
(1997), and &quot;One Case at a Time: Judicial Minimalism on the Supreme 
<br>
Court&quot; (1999).  His writings have appeared in the New York Times, and 
<br>
the New Republic.  He has also appeared on ABC's Nightline, the 
<br>
NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, NBC and CBS evening news and other 
<br>
programming.
<br>
<p>In &quot;Republic.Com&quot; Cass Sunstein makes the point that in cyberspace 
<br>
individuals now have the ability to filter out everything they don't 
<br>
want to read or see and filter in only those whose opinions they 
<br>
agree with.  He calls this the &quot;Daily Me&quot;, the ability to filter only 
<br>
the issues that concern you, read only the op-eds that only share 
<br>
your point of view.  In short he fears that the Internet will bring 
<br>
about a lack of diversity and will amplify extremism and hate groups 
<br>
(Whatever that means).  He writes of &quot;cybercascades&quot; that brings 
<br>
groups of people together who share similar viewpoints that in turn 
<br>
causes group polarization and radicalization.
<br>
<p>Here's how he says it works: &quot;Thus, for example, a group whose 
<br>
members lean against gun control will, in discussion, provide a wide 
<br>
range of arguments against gun control, and the arguments made for 
<br>
gun control will be both fewer and weaker.  The group's members, to 
<br>
the extent that they shift, will shift toward a more extreme position 
<br>
against gun control.  And the group as a whole, if a group decision 
<br>
is required, will move not to the median position, but to a more 
<br>
extreme point.&quot; (Chapter 3, pages 67 68)
<br>
<p>He does his argument great damage by using as an example of a hate 
<br>
and extremist group the usual left wing target, The National Rifle 
<br>
Association (NRA) He trots out the usual suspects such as Skinheads 
<br>
and the KKK and fails to mention any of the other hate groups such as 
<br>
American supporters of Peru's shining path, environmental terrorists 
<br>
who spike logging areas, World Trade Organization protestors/rioters 
<br>
or other left wing extremists.  In Chapter three Sunstein speaks of 
<br>
the gun rights movement alongside the KKK, God Hates Fags, and other 
<br>
hate groups in what can only be considered as an attempt of guilt by 
<br>
association.
<br>
<p>In Chapter seven, Sunstein writes: &quot;FREE SPEECH IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE&quot; 
<br>
his caps not mine.  In fact he mentions this line several times 
<br>
throughout the book.  He continues: &quot;We can identify some flaws in 
<br>
the emerging view of the First Amendment by investigating the idea 
<br>
that the free speech guarantee is &quot;an absolute&quot;, in the specific 
<br>
sense that government may not regulate speech at all.  This view 
<br>
plays a large role in public debate, and in some ways it is a 
<br>
salutary myth.&quot; He mentions the usual examples of child pornography, 
<br>
copyright and threats to assassinate the President as examples of the 
<br>
government restricting speech.   He creates what I consider a straw 
<br>
man argument by prefacing these remarks for his &quot;Policies and 
<br>
Proposals&quot; in Chapter eight.
<br>
<p>He laments the fact that in the past the Public Broadcasting System 
<br>
(PBS) in a four station universe had a significant voice.  But with 
<br>
the advent of programming with hundreds of choices the justification 
<br>
for PBS is diluted.
<br>
<p>As a partial solution he endorses Andrew Shapiro's suggestion from 
<br>
the book &quot;The Control Revolution&quot; that the government should support 
<br>
a public website, Public.Net. Sunstein writes: &quot;Public.Net would 
<br>
provide an icon, visible on your home computer.  You would be under 
<br>
no obligation to click on it; indeed in a free society perhaps you 
<br>
should be permitted to remove the icon if you really do not like it.&quot; 
<br>
He envisions Public.Net to include sections on the &quot;environment, 
<br>
civil rights, gun control, foreign affairs, and so forth.&quot; (Chapter 
<br>
8, page 181)
<br>
<p>But what I find most troubling is his idea to require websites to 
<br>
maintain hyperlinks to those with differing viewpoints.  His example 
<br>
on page 188:
<br>
&quot; We might easily imagine a situation in which textual references to 
<br>
organizations or institutions are hyperlinks, so that if, for 
<br>
example, a conservative magazine such as the &quot;National Review&quot; refers 
<br>
to the World Wildlife Fund or Environmental Defence, it also allows 
<br>
readers instant access to their sites.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sunstein continues: &quot;To the extent that sites do not do this, 
<br>
voluntary self regulation through cooperative agreements might do the 
<br>
job.  If these routes do not work, it would be worthwhile considering 
<br>
content-neutral regulation, designed to ensure more in the way of 
<br>
both links and hyperlinks.&quot;
<br>
<p>Princeton sent me a free review copy of Republic.Com, which I'm glad 
<br>
they did as I would have been highly upset to have paid money for it. 
<br>
I can understand why Professor Sunstein makes the suggestions he 
<br>
does.  In my opinion it has less to do with wanting to expand free 
<br>
and open discourse and more to do with control.  Who gets to decide 
<br>
which links get to be included as &quot;opposing viewpoints&quot;?  I did note 
<br>
that many of Sunstein's examples involved a right wing organization 
<br>
being forced to carry left wing links.
<br>
<p>The celebrated civil libertarian, John Stuart Mill, contended that 
<br>
enlightened judgment is possible only if one considers all facts and 
<br>
ideas, from whatever source, and tests one's own conclusions against 
<br>
opposing views. Therefore, all points of view -- even those that are 
<br>
&quot;bad&quot; or socially harmful -- should be represented in the 
<br>
&quot;marketplace of ideas.&quot; And the Internet is an incredibly free and 
<br>
eclectic smorgasbord of ideas. And just as we have freedom to choose 
<br>
which sites we visit or what print magazines or books we read, it 
<br>
would be the end of freedom as we know it if the government forced us 
<br>
to read or watch what they want, even if it were only a link. 
<br>
Thanks, but no thanks to Republic.Com.
