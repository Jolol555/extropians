<p>
Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov
<br>
<p>Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov, an unassuming librarian at the Rumyantsev
<br>
Museum, having published not a single book during his life and denying the
<br>
right to sell his books, a Russian original and an eccentric, known but in a
<br>
very narrow circle, was a genius of a man. N. Fedorov -- is a Russian's
<br>
Russian, in him one can learn the uniqueness of Russian thought and Russian
<br>
searchings. Inherent to his life was a natural, undifficult asceticism and
<br>
unique righteousness. The most notable Russian people of  his time spoke
<br>
about N. F. ecstatically and deferred before his person. Dostoevsky, not
<br>
knowing N. F. personally, writes about his &quot;idea&quot;, that &quot;in essence I am
<br>
completely in agreement with these thoughts. I perceive them as though they
<br>
were my own&quot;.  Vl. Solov'ev, on whom N. F. had a tremendous and as yet
<br>
unstudied influence, writes to him: &quot;I have read your manuscript avidly and
<br>
with delight of spirit... Your project (the discussion is about Fedorov idea
<br>
of resuscitation) I accept unconditionally and without any quibblings...
<br>
Your project is the first movement forward of the human spirit on the path
<br>
to Christ. I, on my side, can but acknowledge You my teacher and spiritual
<br>
father&quot;. Fet reports to N. F. the remark about him by L. Tolstoy: &quot;I am
<br>
proud, that I live at the same time with suchlike a man&quot;, and added for
<br>
himself: &quot;I know of no man, knowing You, who would not express about You
<br>
this sort of thing&quot;.  L. Tolstoy defers before the moral figure of N. F. and
<br>
forgave him quite harsh rebukes.   The friend of  N. F., V. A. Kozhevnikov,
<br>
who wrote a book about him, says concerning him: &quot;This was a man wise and
<br>
righteous, and those more close to him tend to add: this was one of those
<br>
righteous ones, who hold the world together&quot;. A fundamental idea of N. F.,
<br>
was a purely Russian idea of the responsibility of all for all, the idea of
<br>
the active participation of man in the matter of universal salvation and
<br>
resurrection. N. F. was sickened at the discord and non-brotherly
<br>
relationships among people. He was not at all a writer, nor was he a
<br>
philosopher in the usual sense of the word, and he never strove after what
<br>
is called &quot;cultural creativity&quot;, -- he sought after the &quot;deed&quot; and the
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;task&quot; of universal salvation. He himself is at the extreme opposite
<br>
antipode to individualism, and a peculiar collectivist. He had no interest
<br>
for the subjective world of the soul and is repulsed by the romanticism of
<br>
cultural people. N. F. is a mortal enemy of Capitalist society, as lacking
<br>
in kinship, grounded in discord, godless and anti-Christian, and in this he
<br>
is more radical than the Communists, which bear comparison with N. F. in
<br>
views on the bourgeoisie. The teaching of N. F. is first of all a calling
<br>
forth and summoning to an universal task, towards a religious organisation
<br>
of labour and the regulating of labour. He has no love for the teachings of
<br>
the privileged, separating thought from life, and he denounces the sin of
<br>
the falling-away of the Intelligentsia from the people. Completely foreign
<br>
to him is any theoretical philosophy, any contemplative metaphysics. His own
<br>
philosophy is projective and active. Philosophy ought not passively to
<br>
reflect the world, but the rather to actively transfigure and improve the
<br>
world. In this N. F. has a formal affinity with Marx. The separation of the
<br>
theoretical reason from the practical is a sinful downfall of thought.
<br>
Therefore he calls his philosophy &quot;The Philosophy of the Common Task&quot;. Only
<br>
that philosophy is authentic and justified, at the foundation of which lies
<br>
a grieving over the sorrow and death of people. This grieving was to an
<br>
utmost degree in N. F. himself, and in this he stands at an extraordinary
<br>
spiritual height.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For N. F., the sole and ultimate evil is death. Every evil issues
<br>
forth from death and leads to death. The worldwide struggle against death is
<br>
a task, set before mankind. N. F. frequently criticises the teaching about
<br>
progress, as comprising a religion of death. Progress arranges life for the
<br>
graveyard, upon the decaying bones of the ancestors, it is based upon a
<br>
forgetting of obligation in regard to the deceased fathers, it legitimatises
<br>
the devouring by the generation following of the generation preceding,
<br>
progress becomes reconciled with death and is contrary to the idea of
<br>
resurrection and resuscitation. The genuine vocation of man is the calling
<br>
to be a resuscitator to life. In the world-concept of N. F. there is an
<br>
unique combination of conservative and revolutionary elements. He wants a
<br>
radical turnaround of time from the future to the past, a victory over
<br>
death-bearing time. Man ought to concern himself not only over his
<br>
descendants, but also over his ancestors, he has an obligation not only to
<br>
his sons, but also to his fathers. Man is first of all a son, and N. F.
<br>
wanted as it were to reveal and affirm the sonship of man. The human son
<br>
ought to have memory and concern for the dead fathers, he cannot reconcile
<br>
himself with death. Christianity is the religion of Resurrection. And N. F.
<br>
speaks not only about the Resurrection (Voskresenie), but also about
<br>
Resuscitation (Voskreshenie). Man is called to an active preparation of the
<br>
universal Resurrection, and this means also, that he is called to
<br>
Resuscitation. People ought to unite themselves into a common task of
<br>
Resuscitation. N. F. is a terrible enemy of the Monophysite tendencies
<br>
within Christianity. For him it is not only God that is active, but also
<br>
man. In this is the meaning of the Christological dogma about God-manhood.
<br>
The separation of heaven and earth is a distortion of Christianity.
<br>
Christianity strives for the transfiguration of the earth, to a regulation
<br>
of world life, to the inclusion of reason and consciousness into the
<br>
elemental powers of nature, to the conquest of death-bearing nature by man
<br>
the resurrector. Faith in the active vocation of man for N. F. is connected
<br>
with a faith in reason, in science, in technology, in the possibility of the
<br>
regulation of the whole of nature. His thought possesses a cosmic sweep. In
<br>
nature rage irrational elemental powers, which leads to the triumph of
<br>
death. The victory over death is a victory over these unregulated elemental
<br>
powers through regulation, through the expedient activity of man. But the
<br>
regulation of the elements of nature for N. F. is not by conquest and
<br>
violence, it is not by force, but is rather the fulfilling of a sacred duty
<br>
afront the dead, before the fathers, and it is wrought not for the future
<br>
only, but also for the past, for the restoration of the dust of the
<br>
ancestors. The roots of Fedorov's idea of the regulation of nature differs
<br>
from the idea of the progress of civilisation. N. F. first of all is a
<br>
Christian and Orthodox. A godless science and technology can sow only but
<br>
death. The novelty of the idea of N. F., frightening to so many, is in this,
<br>
that he affirmed the activity of man as immeasurably greater, than that
<br>
which Humanism and Progressism believes in. The Resurrection is a deed not
<br>
only of God's grace, but also of human activity. The passive attitude
<br>
towards the elemental powers of nature and the death that is summoned forth
<br>
by them, he regards as the greatest evil. N. F. was original too as a
<br>
Slavophil and he acknowledged a great superiority of the East over the West,
<br>
but in no way was he an adherent of the Eastern passivity of man. In the
<br>
West man was more active, but this activity was a false activity. It was
<br>
expressed by the Western progress, which death rules in. Western
<br>
civilisation for N. F. is based upon citizenship, and not upon kinship. But
<br>
the citizens -- are prodigal sons, having forgotten their fathers. He is
<br>
likewise negative in regard to comradship, which is contrary to brotherhood.
<br>
Brotherhood presupposes sonship, which is a fundamental category in the
<br>
social thought of N. F. The true society is kinship and brotherhood, based
<br>
on sonship. The primal archetype of true human society is the Holy Trinity.
<br>
The whole world ought to be organised on the model of the Divine Trinity, an
<br>
Heavenly kinship. The peculiar social utopianism of N. F. consists in this,
<br>
that he believed in the possibility of a patriarchal and kindred sociality,
<br>
based on a cult of ancestors. He underestimated the power of evil and
<br>
discord in human society. He believed in an utopia of a Russian autocratic
<br>
monarchism, which should become worldwide and universal. The Russian
<br>
Orthodox tsar ought to rule all the natural world and stand at the head of
<br>
the son-resurrectors. This presupposes likewise an oneness of faith, on
<br>
which there is little basis to count on. N. F. was in essence antagonistic
<br>
towards the state and a citizen society. The human society ought to be
<br>
familial, and based on a common religious cult. He is an extreme enemy to
<br>
any sort of secularisation. Everything ought anew to become sacral. The wars
<br>
of nations, just like the struggle of classes, ought to cease, and the power
<br>
of a religiously united mankind ought to be turned into a war against the
<br>
elemental powers of nature and against death. The armies ought to be turned
<br>
towards the struggle against the elements of meteorological phenomena,
<br>
towards a conquest of the universe. But this presupposes the pacification of
<br>
mankind, the victory over the evil will within mankind.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;project&quot; of N. F., which Vl. Solov'ev was entirely in
<br>
agreement with, was the boldest thing in all of Christian history: people
<br>
ought to unite for a common task -- the resuscitation of dead ancestors.
<br>
Christianity up to the present time has believed in resurrection, but never
<br>
did it make bold to speak about a resuscitation, about the activity of man
<br>
in the restoration of life to the fathers. N. F. demanded, that all the
<br>
whole life of people, the whole of culture, be transferred to the graveyard,
<br>
near to the dust of the ancestors. Alongside churchly liturgy there ought to
<br>
be an outside-churchly liturgy, the whole of life ought to become an
<br>
outside-churchly liturgy. The very division into sacral and profane ought to
<br>
be surmounted, -- all ought to be sacral. The originality of N. F. is in
<br>
this, that together with this he acknowledged the great significance of
<br>
science, technology and organised labour. He is hostile to a dreamy romantic
<br>
and mystical mindset. He wants it real, almost that it be a materialistic
<br>
resuscitation. The first condition of the common task of the resuscitation
<br>
of the dead ancestors appears to be a moral unifying of people, the ceasing
<br>
of discord and strife, the revealing of brotherly and filial live. This is
<br>
an obligatory spiritual condition, without which &quot;the common task&quot; is
<br>
impossible. Man ought spiritually and morally to be conscious of himself as
<br>
a resurrector, to be conscious of his obligation in regard to the fathers,
<br>
i.e. all dead mankind. The moral consciousness of N. F. is extraordinarily
<br>
lofty, higher than this consciousness no one yet in the Christian world has
<br>
risen, and it is immeasurably higher than that consciousness, wherein
<br>
Christianity is but a religion of personal salvation, a &quot;transcendental
<br>
egoism&quot;. Each Christian ought to think about salvation, the restoration to
<br>
life, the resurrection of all, not only about the living, but also about the
<br>
dead, not only about oneself and one's children, but also about all the sons
<br>
of mankind. Man for N. F. is first of all a son, and therefore already a
<br>
father and brother. And he proposes to assert a cult of the &quot;eternal
<br>
childliness&quot; in place of the bad cult of &quot;eternal femininity&quot;, in the name
<br>
of which according to N. F. has been created Capitalism, with its sense of
<br>
luxury and pleasure in life. For N. F. a masculine purity was
<br>
characteristic, the complete absence of decadence, which appeared in the
<br>
subsequent generation. But further on there occurs an even more problematic
<br>
and questionably provocative matter in the teaching of N. F. about
<br>
resuscitation. According to the teaching of N. F., resuscitation is to be
<br>
understood not only by the deed wrought by Christ, the Redeemer and Saviour,
<br>
and not only by the spiritual and moral effects of mankind, by human love
<br>
for the dead, but also by the scientific, technical and physical activity of
<br>
people. The life of people, transferred to the graveyard, ought to be the
<br>
experience of the restoration of the dust of the ancestors by the conjoint
<br>
efforts of religion and science, of the priest and the erudite technician.
<br>
He speaks further about physical-chemical experiments of resuscitation, that
<br>
produce an almost painful impression. The faith of N. F. in the power of
<br>
science and technology is unbounded, but the realisation of this power is
<br>
possible only under certain delimited religious and spiritual conditions.
<br>
Within the world-concept of N. F. there are strong elements of nationalism
<br>
and rationalism, which in him are reconciled with traditional Orthodoxy. He
<br>
underestimated the irrational powers in life and the irrational was for him
<br>
always an elemental evil, to be overcome by regulation, i.e. the
<br>
rationalisation of world life.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us consider the most grandiose and dizzying idea of N. Fedorov.
<br>
In N. F. there was a completely original and unprecedented attitude towards
<br>
apocalyptic propheticism, and his teaching represents something completely
<br>
new within the Russian apocalyptic consciousness and Russian apocalyptic
<br>
hopes. Russian apocalypticism usually assumes a passive form. Russian man
<br>
awaits the end of the world, the coming of the Anti-Christ and the final
<br>
struggle of the good and evil principles. But he himself passively undergoes
<br>
the mystical winnowing of the Apocalypse. Such a passive apocalypticism was
<br>
in our schismatics, it was in K. Leont'ev and in Vl. Solov'ev towards the
<br>
end of his life. There draws nigh the end of the world, everything
<br>
disintegrates, the kingdom of the Anti-Christ approaches. Man does not have
<br>
the strength to oppose it. But the mindset of N. F. is completely otherwise.
<br>
He taught, that the apocalyptic propheticisms are conditional, they
<br>
represent only a threat. If mankind does not unite itself for the common
<br>
task of the resuscitation of the dead ancestors, the restoration to life of
<br>
<p><p><p>all mankind, then there will ensue the end of the world, the coming of the
<br>
Anti-Christ, the Dread Last Judgement and eternal perdition for many. But if
<br>
mankind in love unites itself for the common task, to fulfill its duty in
<br>
regard to the deceased fathers, if it with all its strength devotes itself
<br>
to the deed of universal salvation and resurrection, then there will not be
<br>
the end of the world, there will not be the Dread Last Judgement and there
<br>
will not be eternal perdition for anyone. This is a projective and active
<br>
understanding of the apocalypse. It depends on man, for God's plan for the
<br>
world to succeed. Never yet within the Christian world has there been
<br>
expressed so bold and dizzying a thought about the possibility of averting
<br>
the Dread Last Judgement and its inevitable consequences through the active
<br>
participation of man. If what N. F. calls for were to be done, then the end
<br>
of the world would not transpire and mankind with a transfigurative and
<br>
ultimate regulation of nature would pass over directly into eternal life. N.
<br>
F. reveals eschatological perspectives, which never before found expression
<br>
in the Christian world. N. F. -- is a resolute anti-Gnostic, for him
<br>
everything is to be resolved not by passive thought and knowledge, but by
<br>
active deed. The apocalyptic and eschatological consciousness calls for a
<br>
deed, for action, for responsibility. If the end of the world is nigh, then
<br>
this ought also to evoke an unprecedented activity of man, an united effort
<br>
to avert the fatal end and direct the world towards eternal life. In this
<br>
idea there is an extraordinary grandeur and loftiness, to an extent to which
<br>
no one has ever risen.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Russian messianic idea of N. F. assumes a completely new form.
<br>
He believes passionately in Russia and the Russian people, in its singular
<br>
vocation in the world. In Russia is where there ought to begin &quot;the common
<br>
task&quot;. Western Europe is too caught up in culture and progress. But culture
<br>
and progress have betrayed the deed of resuscitation, they go along the path
<br>
of certain death. N. F. did not survive up to the Russian catastrophe, in
<br>
which the Russian messianic idea was so terribly distorted. Russian
<br>
Communism is the opposite antipode of Fedorov's idea, since it made mockery
<br>
over the dust of the ancestors, and it is oriented exclusively towards the
<br>
future. Russian Communism, from Fedorov's point of view, is a religion of
<br>
death, but in it there is a feature of an ape-like affinity with Fedorov's
<br>
&quot;common task&quot; -- the uniting of people, regulation, directed to the common
<br>
welfare and earthly salvation, anti-individualism, a negative attitude
<br>
towards culture, towards the Intelligentsia, towards thought, having lost
<br>
contact with life, and activism and pragmatism. N. F. is extraordinarily
<br>
characteristic of the Russian idea and he awaits his own appraisal. The weak
<br>
side of the teachings of N. F. -- is his inability to see the irrational
<br>
freedom of evil in the world, his rationalistic-naturalistic optimism.
<br>
Therein is begotten his utopianism, so in character for Russian thought. In
<br>
actuality, the mystic is less utopian. N. F. sees in death -- the source of
<br>
evil, and in the victory over death -- the chief task. In this he is right.
<br>
But he understates the mystical significance of the passage through death,
<br>
as an inward moment of life, i.e. the salvific significance of the Cross and
<br>
Golgotha. We ought properly to welcome interest in N. F., the republishing
<br>
of his works and the developing of his ideas. But in our era he can also be
<br>
a false interpreter. The greatness of N. Fedorov is first of all in his
<br>
moral idea, in the sorrowing over the discord and misery of people, in a
<br>
call for human activity, and in the thirst for universal salvation and
<br>
resurrection.
