No, that's not at all what I was saying, and it's very relevant.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a question about how Islam (about 25% of the planet's
<br>
population) would respond to the types of technology we are interested in.
<br>
Anders Sandberg (hoping I spelled that right) mentioned he had been reading
<br>
about Islamic Theology, and the discussion was about how well we might be
<br>
able to deal with Muslims. I then mentioned Muslims might be offended at
<br>
the use of the term theology, and why.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At no point did I say anything about them not discussing the issue,
<br>
you did. &quot;If you want to talk to someone, it's counterproductive to insult
<br>
them, so avoid it when you can&quot; was my point.

<em>&gt;This question seems irrelevant in light of the earlier message thread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;According to you, it's the Muslims who refuse to discuss the subject.
