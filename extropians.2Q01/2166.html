<br>
kind of an argument.  It is so completely twisted and backwards.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me see if I can make some points that will contribute to this 
<br>
discussion and perhaps to someones understanding.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Christian that grew up amongst these people I have informally 
<br>
debated them many times.
<br>
1.  The biggest misunderstanding is yours.  You seem to think of this as a 
<br>
debate between science and religion.  It isn't.  It is a an attack on 
<br>
religious freedom by some fairly bright but unscrupulous power seekers.  The 
<br>
basic tactics they use were well developed by Joe McCarthy and used by a 
<br>
number of people since.
<br>
2.  The stakes are simple.  If you -- plural -- ever accept that religion is 
<br>
the most important consideration and that they are the interpreters of 
<br>
religous orthodoxy then they have won the debate and the power to govern the 
<br>
country.
<br>
3.  If you will listen closely to the creationists interpretation -- to use 
<br>
the word &quot;interpretation&quot; loosely -- and then bother to read the story of 
<br>
creation in the Bible you will find that the creationist's account is 
<br>
deficient.  There are two accounts of creation in the beginning of the Bible; 
<br>
not one and neither fit the creationists account very well.
<br>
4.  The average creationist is a follower not a leader.  He/she doesn't 
<br>
understand the argument at all.  But, preacher Somebody told him that was the 
<br>
right way to think.  These are the ones that you usually encounter.  If you 
<br>
want to take them on then don't discuss science which they don't understand 
<br>
and make no pretense of knowing.  Read the account given in the Bible and 
<br>
discuss that.  They don't know the Bible much better than they know science 
<br>
but the difference is that they are making a Bibical argument and the Bible 
<br>
they do claim to know.  But, they don't.
