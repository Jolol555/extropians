I take it, Robin, that you criticize the legal system for failing to seek 
<br>
truths about the *material facts* that give rise to legal disputes.   To be 
<br>
sure, fact-finding of that sort plays an important role in legal proceedings, 
<br>
especially criminal ones.  But the resolution of a great many legal disputes 
<br>
does *not* turn on facts about the physical world; indeed, such disputes find 
<br>
the parties stipulating to the relevant facts (e.g., motions to dismiss) or 
<br>
effectively powerless to affect the court's understanding of the facts (e.g., 
<br>
appellate proceedings).  Rather, such disputes turn on the *legal 
<br>
interpretation* of undisputed matters of fact (&quot;common priors&quot; in your 
<br>
usage).  And in that context I think it appropriate to say that the 
<br>
adversarial parties *do* see themselves as participating in a process 
<br>
designed to uncover truth--to wit, truth about the law.
<br>
<p>Relatedly, I would not concede that even in legal proceedings where 
<br>
adversarial parties do aim primarily at establishing material facts that the 
<br>
salient desire to win trumps all.  A vast body of evidenciary rules and 
<br>
ethical obligations control the collection of facts in such instances.  
<br>
Granted that legal processes do not necessarily facilitate the revelation of 
<br>
all material facts (particularly in criminal cases); still, it bears 
<br>
emphasizing that such institutional features strongly discourage the 
<br>
generation of falsehoods.
<br>
<p>A few other comments follow below.

<p><em>&gt;The legal process may produce truth, but I think it safe to say that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual lawyers do not think of themselves as participating primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to produce truth.  They want to win.  Most academics, on the other hand, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think of themselves as seeking truth, so it seems worth pointing out to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that their behavior suggests that they also mainly want to win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I doubt that deliberate exaggeration itself facilitates the search for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;truth.  The best institutions we can find using existing humans may in fact 
</em><br>
frequently
<br>
<em>&gt;result in exaggeration.  In which case it would be negative we should accept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But it would still be something truth-seekers would regret.  And I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my doubts about how well existing legal and academic institutions do at 
</em><br>
promoting
<br>
<em>&gt;truth.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't understand the &quot;it would be negative we should accept&quot; bit, but I 
<br>
take it that you mean to say that truthseekers should not welcome 
<br>
exagerration because institutions relying on exagerration do not do well at 
<br>
promoting truth.  That's an empirical claim, of course, and you may be right. 
<br>
&nbsp;Indeed, of all people, *you* have good grounds to claim that there are 
<br>
better institutions than extant legal and academic ones for promoting truth.  
<br>
But I would emphasize that no mere aesthetic objection to *individuals* 
<br>
deliberately exagerrating their version of the truth should serve to 
<br>
discredit an *institution* designed to, in the aggregate and thanks to 
<br>
competition between such individuals, uncover truth.  That's the sort of 
<br>
objection that newbie law students make about the law (&quot;Why don't we all just 
<br>
hold hands and agree instead of engaging in all this unpleasant fighting?!&quot;) 
<br>
and, I daresay, the sort of objection that ignorant socialists make about 
<br>
&quot;wasteful&quot; economic competition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;... Consider, for instance, that we agree about almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;everything.  That's perhaps an odd thing to say, but only, I think, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;we take our nearly universal agreement for granted.  Most conversation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;particularly outside of professional and academic contexts, does not involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;debate.  (Review, for instance, recent discussion around your household.)  
</em><br>
We
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;debate only a very few, usually not very important (e.g., sports), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;usually not very easily resolved (e.g., theology) issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think this is just not true.  Ordinary people disagree on just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything, e.g., household chores, who likes who, what foods are healthy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They disagree especially on just about any question of individual ability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People consistently think themselves more able than others think them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in cooking, driving, kissing, you name it.
</em><br>
<p>That, too, is an empirical claim.  I can only say that I know of no 
<br>
scientific study on the issue--and that my personal experience seems to vary 
<br>
widely from yours.  Call me a laid-back Californian, but I just don't spend 
<br>
much time around the house or office arguing with people!
