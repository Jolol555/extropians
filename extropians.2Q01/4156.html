<br>
<p>The Harsh Destiny of a Planet?
<br>
<p>The VLT Uncovers Traces of Stellar Cannibalism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the star HD 82943 swallow one of its planets?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What may at a first glance look like the recipe for a dramatic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;science-fiction story is in fact the well-considered conclusion of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;serious scientific study, to be published by a group of astronomers in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Switzerland and Spain [1] in tomorrow's issue of the international
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;research journal &quot;Nature&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the very efficient UVES high-resolution spectrograph at the ESO VLT
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2-m KUEYEN telescope, they have convincingly detected the presence of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the rare isotope Lithium-6 (6Li; [2]) in this metal-rich, solar-type dwarf
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;star that is also known to possess a planetary system, cf. ESO Press
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Release 13/00.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the Lithium-7 (7Li) isotope of this light element, any primordial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium-6 would not survive the early evolutionary stages of a metal-rich
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;solar-type star. The Lithium-6 now seen in HD 82943 must therefore have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been added later, but from where? The astronomers believe that this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;observation strongly suggests that the star has at some moment engulfed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;one of its planets, whose Lithium-6 was then deposited in the star's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;atmosphere.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This surprising discovery represents important observational evidence that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;planets may fall into their host stars.

<br>
<p>HD 82943 and its planetary system
<br>
<p>The last few years have seen the discovery of more than 60 new planetary
<br>
systems. One of the most prolific planet search programmes is being carried
<br>
out by the Geneva Extra-Solar Planet Search Group, by means of the CORALIE
<br>
spectrograph at the 1.2-m Leonard Euler Swiss Telescope at the ESO La Silla
<br>
Observatory (Chile).
<br>
<p>One of the stars included in this programme is the dwarf star HD 82943 in
<br>
the constellation Hydra (The Water Snake). It is slightly hotter and larger
<br>
than the Sun and was recently found to harbour a planetary system with (at
<br>
least) two giant planets, cf. ESO Press Release 07/01.
<br>
<p>Like most extra-solar planets (&quot;exoplanets&quot;) found to date, the orbits
<br>
of the objects orbiting HD 82943 are quite unlike those expected from
<br>
traditional theories of the formation and evolution of such systems [3].
<br>
Contrary to the giant planets in the Solar System, those at HD 82943 have
<br>
rather elongated orbits, and they are unsually close to the central star.
<br>
<p>Astronomers believe that giant planets must form in comparatively cool
<br>
environments, as this was the case in the solar system. The existence of
<br>
systems in which the giant planets are much closer to the central star can
<br>
only be explained by certain dynamical processes, e.g. significant orbital
<br>
changes with time (&quot;orbital migration&quot;) or the effects of strong
<br>
gravitational interaction between several planets.
<br>
<p>These processes can explain the short-period planetary systems found to
<br>
date, in which planets are very close to the central star, and also the
<br>
very elongated orbits found in some cases.
<br>
<p>These theories also predict that it may be the fate of some planets to fall
<br>
into their host star.
<br>
<p>The significance of Lithium
<br>
<p>Unlike most other elements lighter than Iron, the light nuclei of Lithium
<br>
(both the Lithium-6 and Lithium-7 isotopes [2]), Beryllium and Boron are
<br>
not produced in significant amounts in the stellar spheres of fire.
<br>
<p>In fact, Lithium-6 is extremely &quot;fragile&quot;, being easily destroyed by proton
<br>
collisions at a temperature of &quot;only&quot; 1.5 million degrees -- by comparison,
<br>
the fusion of Hydrogen to Helium takes place at about 10 million degrees.
<br>
In the case of solar-like stars, any Lithium-6 atoms present in a newborn
<br>
star will be &quot;burnt&quot; during the early evolutionary stages. Strong internal
<br>
motions will thoroughly mix the outer (cooler) and inner (hotter) stellar
<br>
layers, and Lithium-6 will completely disappear in just a few million
<br>
years. We would therefore not expect to find any Lithium-6 in a developed
<br>
solar-type star.
<br>
<p>However, during the later evolutionary stages the outer layers of a
<br>
solar-type star remain better &quot;separated&quot; from the hotter central parts.
<br>
Thus, if some Lithium-6 is now picked up from the outside, it is therefore
<br>
possible that it will be preserved in the upper, cooler regions for some
<br>
time, possibly billions of years.
<br>
<p>Unlike stars, planets never reach temperatures that are high enough to burn
<br>
their initial content of Lithium-6. Consequently, planets will retain their
<br>
Lithium-6. So, if a planet happens to fall into a solar-type star like HD
<br>
82943, we may then be able to detect this isotope in the stellar spectrum.
<br>
<p>In the case of &quot;metal-poor&quot; stars -- that are less rich in metals than the
<br>
Sun -- the mixing process in the early phase is less efficient and some
<br>
original Lithium-6 may actually survive.
<br>
<p>Detection of Lithium-6 in HD 82943 with UVES
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;ESO PR Photo 17/01
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Caption: The spectrum of HD 82943, showing the region around the Lithium
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;absorption line. The general shape of this spectral line is caused by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium-7 atoms in the atmosphere of the star, while the presence of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lithium-6 causes a certain asymmetry. Model computations have been used
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to calculate the amount of the two Lithium isotopes; the two fully drawn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;curves correspond to 6Li/7Li = 0.12 (red) and no Lithium-6 (0.00; blue),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;respectively. The difference (O-C = Observed - Calculated) is shown below
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and demonstrates the very good fit for an isotopic ratio of 0.12 (red
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dots). Technical information about this photo is available below.
<br>
<p>The possible presence of Lithium-6 in a stellar atmosphere can be checked
<br>
by means of a detailed analysis of the star's spectrum. For this, the
<br>
astronomers search for a very small asymmetry in the &quot;stronger&quot; absorption
<br>
line in the red spectral region that is caused by Lithium-7 atoms in the
<br>
stellar atmosphere.
<br>
<p>However, this type of investigation is critically dependent on the
<br>
availability of very detailed and &quot;clean&quot; spectra (i.e., very high spectral
<br>
resolution and excellent signal-to-noise ratio). This is a great
<br>
observational challenge and to date, only about five stars are known to
<br>
display the signatures of Lithium-6 in their spectra, cf. ESO PR 08/00.
<br>
In all cases, the measured isotopic abundance ratio is very small, with
<br>
6Li/7Li less than about 0.05. All of these stars are metal-poor and may
<br>
have retained some of their initial Lithium-6, see above.
<br>
<p>Until now, no convincing detection of Lithium-6 has ever been made in a
<br>
metal-rich, solar-type star.
<br>
<p>The UVES spectrograph at the 8.2-m VLT KUEYEN telescope is perfectly suited
<br>
for this kind of study. Three high-resolution spectra of HD 82943 were
<br>
obtained in June 2000 that show a significant asymmetry in the Lithium-7
<br>
absorption line, cf. PR Photo 17/01. After a careful analysis, this
<br>
asymmetry is confirmed as the spectral signature of Lithium-6 atoms. The
<br>
observed abundance ratio is 6Li/7Li = 0.12. This is unusually high when
<br>
compared to the detections in metal-poor stars and is in fact more
<br>
compatible with the value of 0.08, observed in solar-system meteorites!
<br>
<p>HD 82943 has swallowed a planet
<br>
<p>The astronomers believe they know the answer: &quot;The simplest and most
<br>
convincing way to explain this observation is that one or more planets,
<br>
or at least planetary material, have fallen into the star, sometime after
<br>
it passed through its early evolutionary stage&quot;, says Nuno Santos of the
<br>
Geneva Observatory.
<br>
<p>Garik Israelian of Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias adds: &quot;One may also
<br>
try to determine the quantity of material needed to explain the observed
<br>
isotopic ratio of 0.12. Based on the mass estimate of the star HD 82943 and
<br>
the known Lithium-6 content of meteorites, it appears that the star has
<br>
swallowed the equivalent of a giant planet with twice the mass of Jupiter&quot;.
<br>
If the unlucky planet were of the terrestrial type, in which the relative
<br>
Lithium-6 content is higher, it would have had a mass of about three times
<br>
the mass of the Earth.
<br>
<p>The observational search for Lithium-6 in other stars with planetary systems
<br>
now continues. In due time, it will permit to better understand the
<br>
formation and evolution of the newly discovered exoplanets. In particular,
<br>
it will demonstrate whether the fall of planets into their host stars is a
<br>
common process or not.
<br>
<p>More information
<br>
<p>Further detailed information is available in the research article (&quot;Evidence
<br>
for planet engulfment by the star HD 82943&quot;, by G. Israelian, N.C. Santos,
<br>
M. Mayor and R. Rebolo), published in the May 10, 2001, issue of the
<br>
international research journal Nature.

<p>Notes
<br>
<p>[1] The team consists of Garik Israelian and Rafael Rebolo (Instituto de
<br>
Astrofisica de Canarias, Spain), Nuno C. Santos and Michel Mayor (Geneva
<br>
Observatory, Switzerland).
<br>
<p>[2] The nuclei of Lithium-6 (6Li) atoms consist of three protons and three
<br>
neutrons; those of Lithium-7 (7Li) have three protons and four neutrons.
<br>
Both isotopes were produced during the Big Bang and in spallation reactions
<br>
in the interstellar medium.
<br>
<p>[3] According to the &quot;traditional&quot; view, giant planets like Jupiter would
<br>
be formed by rapidly accelerating (&quot;runaway&quot;) accretion of gas around an
<br>
initial, icy &quot;planetesimal&quot; with a mass of about 10 Earth masses. An
<br>
associated prediction was that giant planets would only be found at a
<br>
distance of at least 750 million kilometres (5 Astronomical Units; or five
<br>
times the distance between the Earth and the Sun) from their host stars and
<br>
that their orbits would be circular, like the orbits of the planets in the
<br>
Solar System.
<br>
<p>Technical information about the photo
<br>
<p>PR Photo 17/01 shows the spectrum of the V = 6.5 mag star HD 82943, as
<br>
obtained on June 7, 2001, with the UVES spectrograph at the 8.2-m VLT KUEYEN
<br>
telescope. It is based on three exposures made with Image Slicer 3 in
<br>
Director's Discretionary Time in Service Mode, and each lasting 120 sec.
<br>
The spectral resolution is 110,000 and the final S/N-ratio is about 500.
