I searched and found a couple things on which I need
<br>
to correct myself.

<em>&gt;Note the difficulty in finding out how the humans are

</em><br>
<em>&gt;grandmasters plus some slashers from overseas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gather semiannually to play rapid format against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commercial software.
</em><br>
<p>The Harvard Cup site says the tournament has not
<br>
been held since the sixth one in December of 1995 with
<br>
the playoff in May of 1996.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.h3.org/HarvardCup/HarvardCup6.html">http://www.h3.org/HarvardCup/HarvardCup6.html</a>
<br>
<p>That tournament was about 35% silicon 65% carbon,
<br>
actually a better for result for the carbon units than the
<br>
previous tournament held a year earlier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;At that time they were using 200 MHz Pentium II
</em><br>
<em>&gt;class processors.
</em><br>
<p>OK, so it was 133 and 166 Mhz Pentium Pros.  In
<br>
any case, since then we have had three generations
<br>
of processors and more than a factor of 10 improvement
<br>
in processor speed.  I saw a 1.7 Mhz P4 for sale at
<br>
Fry's last week for 1400 bucks.  I bet those machines
<br>
would scalp some the best carbon based players.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I haven't been able to find a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Harvard Cup or equivalent carbon vs silicon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competition using the &gt;1 GHz class of processors.
</em><br>
<p>However, I now suspect some such tournament
<br>
must be taking place somewhere, behind closed
<br>
doors with the scores being kept secret for reasons
<br>
obvious to those handful of players in this world
<br>
who manage to make a living playing chess.
