<p>Well, Sweden actually outlawed cloning of humans in 1991 - many years
<br>
before it was even seen as theoretically possible! It was still
<br>
regarded as unethical by a comission on genetic engineering, which
<br>
also suggested (and got its will through) on a number of bans on
<br>
research into human genetic modifications. And when you hear that
<br>
members of the parliament in the post-Dolly cloning debate bring up
<br>
obviously wrong and misunderstood arguments (such as the grave danger
<br>
of Saddam cloning an army) which are not refuted, then you get
<br>
worried.
<br>
<p>It might not be worth arguing with the person that makes the silly
<br>
claims, because they will not listen. But it is definitely worth
<br>
making the arguments for the benefits of all the listeners, who have
<br>
not yet formed an opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanists in general need to participate in public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; debate more often. That our opposition uses silly arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might make them a bit boring for the moment, but that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also a sign that they never get any hard opposing questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - it is easier to shred the arguments with a well formulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; counterargument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not an easy job; the unprepared can often do more harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than good.  I'm doing everyone here a favour by *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participating in public debate
</em><br>
<p>Well, that might be a good thing sometimes too. With friends like Hugo
<br>
de Garis and Dr Seed, who needs enemies? It is often more painful to
<br>
hear bad arguments for your own side being expressed that you know are
<br>
going to be misunderstood and used against you, than to hear silence
<br>
from your supporters or good arguments from your enemies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;, I no longer have the slightest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clue of how to communicate with the uninitiated, I just look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bemused and, when I'm feeling talkative, ridicule them.
</em><br>
<p>Just a thought, maybe you should see if a change of tone works. People
<br>
react badly to what they consider condescension (I don't know if you
<br>
speak that way, but the above sentence reeked of it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Occasionally I try to win a convert, they nod in agreement as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I step them through my meticulously thought-out argument and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then accept the conclusion with the caveat that &quot;oh, well, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dunno&quot;.  Nothing changes.  With public debate, I imagine, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the audience members you're trying to win over; the ones who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't really thought about it, sort of agree, and now have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something concrete to work with (&quot;oh yeah, well I heard this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy on the radio the other day and he sez...&quot;).  This is all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very difficult when faced with a debate opponent who doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite share our respect for rationalism.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, the &quot;logic is just a rhetorical weapon&quot; people. Yes, arguing
<br>
against them is hard and messy. I think the best way to deal with them
<br>
is to give examples and simple, clear explanations that make it very
<br>
easy to see where the non-rational approach doesn't work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I do appreciate the efforts of those of you who are out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there spreading the word, I just (naively) wish that it wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.  Our opponents, for all their hand waving, offer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world nothing.
</em><br>
<p>If you have nothing to offer, wave your hands faster. :-)
