<p>Alex, I think you want to talk to Jeff.  I gave him access to all the
<br>
relevant materials I have yesterday.  I think Pokrovskii worked most
<br>
of this out, perhaps Suffern as well.  As Jeff is going through it
<br>
he might know offhand what are the specific papers you need to look at.
<br>
<p>The think the URL for Pokrovskii is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/ETI/Authors/Pokrovskii-GI/">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/ETI/Authors/Pokrovskii-GI/</a>
<br>
<p>I think you can get access to the files in that directory by hitting
<br>
the CANCEL button on the username/password screen (perhaps multiple
<br>
times).  If you want access to anything else you will need to make
<br>
a formal request.  Spike has also given some thought to the problem.
<br>
<p>Robert
