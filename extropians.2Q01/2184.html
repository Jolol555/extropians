Glen,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the obvious endrun around this is to find areas to express
<br>
raw talent that aren't common enough to have &quot;world champs&quot;
<br>
in the limelight.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;F.i. one of the things I do with myself when I am not making
<br>
a fool of myself with ignorant posts to transhuman lists is a
<br>
martial art. But I am (to put it kindly) only &quot;moderately gifted&quot;.
<br>
(Actually I just suck!)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still I get by, even though a even moderately skilled state or
<br>
national contender could have me for lunch. With a salad.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I went out and picked a style to play that is so exotic and 
<br>
unheard of that the &quot;champions&quot; of that style have real problems
<br>
finding good students. So they put up with my crap on the offchance 
<br>
I will be moderately skillful...someday :)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I also picked a style where habitual practice and skills are far
<br>
more important than &quot;raw physical talent&quot;. Where high intelligence
<br>
is a big factor in researching tactical combinations. And one where
<br>
you can practice past 30 or 40, so when the &quot;champs&quot; are nursing
<br>
bad knees..the turtle boy is still plugging away.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know other people in other areas who did similar things, faced
<br>
with only &quot;moderate giftedness&quot; they refused to lose at &quot;their own
<br>
game&quot; and rewrote the rules...often changing their art into something
<br>
unrecognizable by their former associates. It's easy to be the best
<br>
when you are the only one doing something!!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides...with the trumpeting of &quot;high giftedness&quot; most people stop
<br>
working..after all..they say &quot;I will never be that good!&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So. what are the chances I will run into Helio Gracie's evil twin
<br>
in a bar? I just have to stay healthy, keep practicing..and be better
<br>
than the people I meet on the street.
<br>
&nbsp;Even if I am a pencil-necked geek :)
<br>

<em>&gt; &quot;... simply moderate giftedness has been made worthless by the printing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; press and radio and television and satellites and all that. A moderately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gifted person who would have been a community treasure a thousand years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago has to give up, has to go into some other line of work, since modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications put him or her into daily competition with nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's champions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The entire planet can get along nicely now with maybe a dozen champion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performers in each area of human giftedness. A moderately gifted person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to keep his or her gifts all bottled up until, in a manner of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking, he or she gets drunk at a wedding and tapdances on the coffee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table like Fred Astaire or Ginger Robers. We have a name for him or her.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We call him or her an 'exhibitionist.'
