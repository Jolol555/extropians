<em>&gt; &gt; Cancer is a chronic condition, not something that progresses to critical

<p>At the main base, yes, where such is treatment, though most get shipped
<br>
out if injured so as to be incapacitated. There is many times more
<br>
workspace at the various antarctic bases than there is aboard ISS, and
<br>
far more people. When my cousin was down there, the main base was
<br>
considered paradise relative to their camp in the Katabatic canyons. At
<br>
his camp, the bathroom was an apple crate with a garbage bag in it,
<br>
exposed to 60 mph winds. Average daily caloric budget was about 10,000
<br>
calories per person, resupplied by airdrop and occasional helicopters.
<br>
<p>When I say crushed bones, I'm not talking simple fractures, but real
<br>
significant crippling hemmorages from not getting out of the way of
<br>
equipment quickly enough, not judging velocity properly, etc. You can
<br>
injure yourself significantly, especially after such significant calcium
<br>
loss as what happens in space, but not in Antarctica. Some astronauts
<br>
take 2 years to recover from a long duration space flight, and that is
<br>
without any injuries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And anyhow, while cancer won't kill within hours, rapid treatment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes a world of difference to the survival rate.  Most everyone I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who has been diagnosed with cancer started receiving treatment within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days, at the insistance of doctors who said there was no time to waste.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the person with cancer, as I recall, was either a physician or
<br>
medically trained enough that they could self administer chemotherapy
<br>
shots delivered by airdrop. Can't do that at the ISS either.
