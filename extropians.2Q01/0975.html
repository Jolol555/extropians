Hello &quot;Emlyn&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:emlyn@one.net.au?Subject=Re:%20How%20To%20Live%20In%20A%20Simulation&In-Reply-To=&lt;200103190016.RAA11843@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">emlyn@one.net.au</a>&gt;,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for joining this discussion!  It's great when
<br>
someone so knowledgeable joins in and has so much to contribute.  Are
<br>
you a philosophy professor on this topic or something?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that my terminology has caused you to make some
<br>
incorrect assumptions about what I believe.  Perhaps, if you have a
<br>
chance, you could read my paper on this.  I'm sure it would help you
<br>
understand better what it is I'm and am not trying to say.  I'd love
<br>
to hear your thoughts on this!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML version: &lt;URL: <a href="http://www.frii.com/~allsop/qualia.htm">http://www.frii.com/~allsop/qualia.htm</a>&gt;

<br>
<p><em>&gt; The *major* assumption is that qualia are something, rather than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figment of our imagination. There is a major camp in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness debate (Dennett et al) who say that qualia are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to describe and define because they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real. Personally, I still lean toward qualia existing and meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something, but I could be swayed the other way... the jury is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely out on this question.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I don't mean to imply that we or especially I, know
<br>
absolutely how things will turn out.  I simply have an opinion, and am
<br>
willing to take almost any bet on this subject, like it will turn out
<br>
that we can't be pure simulations... the topic of this thread.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I argue that qualia aren't difficult to describe at all.  They
<br>
are simply phenomenal (ineffable via causal senses and traditional
<br>
science) properties of some physical stuff in our brain.  When our
<br>
scientific instruments probe the stuff in our brain, they are only
<br>
looking for their causal properties.  This is not enough.
<br>
Subjectively we are able to know more about the stuff in our brain
<br>
than its causal properties.  Once science starts to look for more than
<br>
just the causal properties of this stuff, it will finally start to
<br>
discover what part of our brain it is that has these physical
<br>
properties that make up our conscious knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Secondly, you assume that qualia are not physical.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely not!  As I said above, they are simply the
<br>
phenomenal properties of the physical stuff in our brain that is our
<br>
conscious knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thirdly, and importantly, you assume that qualia are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epiphenomena, which would emerge implicitly from the operation of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain simulation, given that the brain simulation is identical in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation to the original brain. If qualia were an emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property, they should emerge from the sim just as the original,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excepting if there is something sacred in the meat (shades of mvt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and similar silliness).
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, definitely.  But there is something phenomenal about the
<br>
way our brain takes all these qualia and integrates them into our
<br>
conscious knowledge, or as I like to call it, the spirit world of our
<br>
conscious awareness.  Within this spirit world we can experience red
<br>
next to green and know they are very different.  The only way to eff,
<br>
is to augment our brain such that a new qualia can be brought into
<br>
this spirit world that is ur conscious awareness so that we can
<br>
compare and contrast it to the other qualia we experience.  It's not
<br>
quite clear yet, whether something like a single chemical compand has
<br>
some kind of &quot;red&quot; phenomenal properties by itself, or if there has to
<br>
be more physical stuff (a set of neurons?) supporting it before red
<br>
can &quot;emerge&quot; or be realized?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, I think it is clear that qualia are simulatable; either they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are physical, and so measurable and simulatable, or they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intangible, but have tangible effects, which are in themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulatable. If the second case is true, the &quot;qualia themselves&quot; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slashed away by Occam; the effect is all that is necessary.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completely agree.  The simple color detecting machines in
<br>
paint stores can &quot;simulate&quot; more color than our brain can &quot;represent&quot;
<br>
with qualia any day.  Causally, with regards to color, they are more
<br>
intelligent than we are.  I believe fully in zombies, that simulations
<br>
will soon be able to pass the Turing test.  But if these purely
<br>
abstract zombies ever try to indicate they really know what salty is
<br>
like, they would be lying.  If they were honest they would say
<br>
something much more like you indicated: &quot;Eff? What the F?&quot;  By the
<br>
way, can I quote you with this phrase!?  I love it!
<br>
