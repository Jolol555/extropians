<p><em>&gt;what does melanin have to do with electrons?  
</em><br>
<p>A clue to my imagined joy is that `black' has so very little to do with
<br>
melanin. Thomas Jefferson's children with his beloved slave Sally Hemings
<br>
were themselves slaves, able to be bought and sold like horses. Fifteen of
<br>
their 16 direct ancestors were `white' and free. So melanin titer didn't
<br>
count all that much in naming them as `black'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Is it the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;love of the unexpected
</em><br>
<p>In part. It's the empathic pleasure of seeing some feat generally held to
<br>
be impossible achieved by a member of any despised, excluded and restricted
<br>
underclass. It enhances my delight in Samuel R. Delany's wonderful fiction
<br>
to know that he was born in Harlem, and is gay and severely dyslectic; of
<br>
course, the peculiar insight in his work comes in part precisely from his
<br>
experience of oppression (even though his family is a member of the `Negro
<br>
aristocracy' in America and had a comfortable upper-middle class
<br>
professional income, and despite the fact that Chip's school education was
<br>
considerably better than mine as a poor white kid in suburban Australia).
<br>
<p>I'd feel the same buzz if a Russian exiled to Siberia by Stalinists
<br>
invented a powerful new theory of particle asymmetry at the Big Bang. Oh,
<br>
wait.
<br>
<p>As for Lee's question about `Empire writers' (Clarke, Egan, me, etc): I
<br>
think in part this is a heightened awareness of the miseries our culture
<br>
has inflicted on the peoples it ran roughshod over; oddly enough, this
<br>
recognition has been made easier by the fact that by and large none of us
<br>
ever lived surrounded by a tenth of the population literally regarded as
<br>
worth less than dogs. True, in Australia, our white ancestors treated
<br>
aboriginal people appallingly, and their suffering today is a consequence
<br>
of that: people whose parents, grandparents, great grandparents have been
<br>
systematically denied their traditional languages and culture and excluded
<br>
from the dominant culture are truly and almost hopelessly fucked up. To see
<br>
the recent radiant explosion of art from the desert peoples in Australia,
<br>
combining with amazing inventiveness and beauty their ancient themes,
<br>
tropes and iconographies with acrylic paints, canvas, and freshly minted
<br>
visual vocabularies, is awe-inspiring. It brings tears to my eyes. 
<br>
<p>That's why.
