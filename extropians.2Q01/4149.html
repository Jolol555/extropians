<em>&gt;The three-body problem is unsolveable for time T without computing all the

</em><br>
<p>In Newtonian mechanics you cannot, of course, compute all the intervening
<br>
states between now and T, yet we may obtain arbitrarily precise approximations
<br>
(modulo their uselessness for large enough T).  Consideration of the three
<br>
body problem actually helps Egan's point rather than hinders it.  Recall that
<br>
I had also quoted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But then on the next page he goes on, &quot;The equations controlling the 
</em><br>
model were far too complex to solve in a single step. In the process 
<br>
of calculating the solutions, vast arrays of partial results were 
<br>
being generated and discarded along the way. &lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>See?  Sometimes he's saying (a lot of) intermediate steps are calculated,
<br>
and at other times he appears to imply that they're being skipped.  Using
<br>
the principle of charity obliges us to read him in the strongest way that
<br>
we can.  Clearly he's using &quot;equations&quot; in the same manner as one would
<br>
speak of &quot;differential equations&quot;, and their intractability in this case
<br>
also suggests something enormously difficult (like the three body problem).
<br>
<p>Again, the totally weirdest thing is that anyone but Egan would have
<br>
suggested an iterative (chaotic) model, in which the intermediate
<br>
calculations don't **approximate** anything, but rather **comprise**
<br>
the calculation in question.
<br>
<p>By hundred-trillion-synapse problem, I think that you are referring
<br>
to an example of the latter iterative model, and not an example of
<br>
the former differential equations model.  Yes, we certainly think
<br>
this also to be incompressible (no short cuts), just in the way
<br>
that a Life position is incompressible.
<br>
<p>However, speaking again of reversibility, and the n-body problem, I
<br>
wonder if there is any way, for some extremely large integer n,
<br>
to dismiss the possibility of n bodies acting under Newtonian 
<br>
gravitation so that they implement a conscious calculation.  My
<br>
intuition says that this has to be impossible.  But just because
<br>
there is no entropy increase (Newton's equations are time reversible)
<br>
is itself not enough to rule out consciousness, as we know from the
<br>
universality of reversible calculation.
