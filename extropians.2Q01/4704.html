I dunno 'bout you, but to me the guy comes off as arrogant and not 
<br>
very bright in the way he's presenting himself. He's also most likely 
<br>
in for a rude surprise if he thinks the US justice system is going to 
<br>
entertain the vaguest notion of declaring his prosecution unwarranted 
<br>
in his absence; they want you there to have the cuffs slapped on if 
<br>
the decision goes the other way. Furthermore, even if he's found 
<br>
completely blameless on the original charges, he's still guilty of 
<br>
flight.
<br>
<p>Quirk of the law.
<br>
<p>Now I may be proven wrong, and I hope I am--but I've a pretty good 
<br>
idea whose ass is going to kicked here when the dust has settled.
<br>
<p>And it ain't the Church's.
<br>
<p>Now I wonder if his snatch-and-grab comment is a prelude to a 
<br>
prearranged vanishing act...

<em>&gt; On the run from L. Ron Hubbard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keith Henson, Scientology gadfly turned fugitive from justice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explains his reasons for fleeing the United States.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Damien Cave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May 23, 2001 | Keith Henson is waging a one-man crusade against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientology. Arguing that the church threatens to undermine the First
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amendment by suing opponents into submission, he has fought the house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that L. Ron Hubbard built at every turn. Since 1995, when the church
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first angered Net users by trying to close down a newsgroup dedicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discussing Scientology's practices, he has posted documents that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the church considers secret on the Web, picketed the church's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headquarters and defended his actions in court.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just last month, the California Superior Court in Riverside County
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handed Henson a major defeat. Citing Henson's picketing in front of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Riverside's Golden Era Productions (a sound and film studio for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Church of Scientology) last summer and messages he posted in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientology newsgroup, the court found Henson guilty of violating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state's hate-crimes law. His demonstrations, the court ruled,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfered with Scientologists' constitutional right to religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Online critics of Scientology, and some free-speech advocates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded to the decision with outrage, calling Henson &quot;an American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hero.&quot; His conviction, they said, was nothing less than a &quot;miscarriage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of justice,&quot; as one poster at geek site Slashdot put it. Others called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Henson &quot;a martyr.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, Henson's tactics have often seemed a bit quixotic -- even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his supporters say that he tends to act without thinking.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question, for example, the wisdom of Henson's two-line contribution to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thread in the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup about directing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear missile at church members. Henson contends that his post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implied no real threat to Scientology members and that it was merely a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to another post in a long-running joke about &quot;Cruise&quot; (as in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientology celeb Tom) missiles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, it was an odd move for someone ostensibly dedicated to serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critique, and it brought an immediate outcry from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientologists. &quot;Free speech does not protect threats of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction,&quot; said Scientology spokesman Ken Hoden. &quot;It does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect threats of missile attacks. It does not protect what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did. He's trying to hide behind the First Amendment.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Touretzky, a Carnegie Mellon computer scientist and fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientology gadfly, says that Henson tends to incriminate himself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his encounters with Scientologists -- often providing church officials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with legal ammunition they later use against him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Henson's legal strategy has been criticized as well. Cindy Cohn, legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Henson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refused to let the civil liberties nonprofit represent him, choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead to have a court-appointed attorney. Henson contests Cohn's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim -- &quot;I've never been offered help from the EFF,&quot; he says -- but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just last week, he once again confounded his fans by failing to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up at his sentencing hearing, where he could have been sent to jail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So where is Keith Henson and what is he up to? In a telephone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interview from Canada -- where he's applying for political asylum --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Henson explained why he played hooky from the hearing and what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopes to achieve by moving his case forward from abroad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're now a fugitive from justice -- why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I actually came up here for a different reason. I came up here to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picket for another cause. But while I was here, a bunch of people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trolling on the Net, talking about my coming up here as a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refugee. And there was so much trolling and so much interest that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said, &quot;Why not?&quot; So I stayed over an extra day and we checked with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Guidy Mamann, who is apparently a top immigration lawyer in Canada. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chatted for a while, and I filled out the paperwork. He fired up a Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; browser, found some stories and said this was a viable case. So I blew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off [the California court] and I've already paid [Mamann] a retainer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deal with this from up here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not stay and fight from the States?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I would have gotten a certain amount of PR and done a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of damage to [the church] had I gone back and gone to jail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there. But there's a justification for being here. In spite of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that there's more risk and that it generates even more criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems for me, nonetheless, being here has the potential to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more heat on Scientology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you been in touch with the American courts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh yeah, I talked to the probation guy down there this morning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Thursday]. I just updated him on where I was and what was going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on. He didn't have much to say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to enjoy being a martyr for the cause.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other people hold me up as a martyr. I'm not a martyr; I just kick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it must feel good to be in the spotlight. How much of what you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing has to do with the a desire for attention?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a minor factor. The social strokes are reward for doing good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff -- I wouldn't deny that. People work hard to get the Nobel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prize. I'm not going to get the Nobel Prize. I'm not going to get any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of prize. But I'm a known person because I've been involved with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this stuff for a long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much have you spent on your case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've spent about $35,000.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How long do you plan to stay in Canada?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forever. If the U.S. government decides that what I did was not within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the framework of free speech, if the [U.S.] State Department supports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government of Riverside County in what I'm arguing is an abuse of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human rights, then I ain't going back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what happens next?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, there's going to be a review of the situation. Because when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply for refugee status on the basis of human rights, your lawyer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your advocate and the Canadian government is your opposition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An immigration review board adjudicates this thing. And in order to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, by treaty and custom, the Canadian [authorities] go to the State
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Department. They have to go in and investigate, and come up with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcripts and motions and all of that.  They need it in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend themselves, to prove that what went on was a fair and unbiased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the State Department sometimes does this [itself], and at other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times [it has] the Justice Department do it. But I suspect that when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they start doing this thing -- and they realize that there were severe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violations of protocol -- what may well happen is that they may march
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through Riverside County, Calif., and deal with [the church].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the goal of your efforts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ultimate goal is to reform or completely destroy Scientology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's completely undemocratic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you feel like you're getting anywhere with this, in the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh yes, yes indeed. This is the endgame. I don't know whether we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years away or months away or even weeks away. But the problems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientology has at this time are legion. Let's put it this way: a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Scientology] event that for years had been attended at a fairly high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level had 40 percent of the people show up that they expected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where'd you get that number?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From people who were there. We have spies with Scientology --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disaffected Scientologists -- all over the country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It all sounds so cloak-and-dagger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, it's definitely that. For example, we think there's a pretty fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance that Scientology will try to do a snatch-and-grab situation up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, where they come after me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying that you're afraid you'll be kidnapped?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So are you just staying at that same house -- the one where you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking from?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. I'll be living at a number of safe houses here. I'm also taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps as [much] as a billion dollars of electronics work out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you talking about a business that's already established in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it's a huge development project, a huge development and production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project. But I'm not going to go into detail about it.  You'll find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out. If it works, you'll find out about it shortly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since when are you the kind of person who protects secrets?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, I'll give you this. Let's just call it a billion-dollar-scale,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryptic stealth surveillance technology. That'll keep them guessing.
