I believe this question may have first bee inspired by a series of essays in 
<br>
The Edge, from last month. Physicist Free Dyson wondered whether life had to 
<br>
be digital or analog? One of the respondents was cosmologist Lee Smolin, who 
<br>
said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Thus, even a moderately complicated graph may be knotted in a way that no 
<br>
digital computer could classify in a physically relevant amount of time. So 
<br>
it is certainly the case that the information contained in such topological 
<br>
problems is not digital for all practical purposes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Smolin appears to be endorsing the analog computer definition of life, or he 
<br>
may be suggesting something that is neither digital, nor analog.
<br>
<p>&quot;Two other results of quantum gravity, the Bekenstein bound and the 
<br>
holographic principle, require that only finite dimensional state spaces are 
<br>
required to code the quantum information that can be extracted from any 
<br>
region of the world with a finite area boundary. So it seems likely that 
<br>
continuous variables play no role in nature, but at the same time, this does 
<br>
not mean nature is digital in the ordinary sense. The problem is that these 
<br>
finite dimensional state spaces have bases which are distinguished by solving 
<br>
the problem of classifying embeddings of graphs. So while the holographic 
<br>
principle says that no observer in the universe can access more than a finite 
<br>
amount of information, that information may be stored in a way that cannot be 
<br>
represented digitally by any computer that could be built inside the 
<br>
universe.&quot;
<br>
<p>So the physics behind a purely digital computer are self-limiting (if I 
<br>
understand this) in Smolin's view. Smolin goes on to state a 'combinatoric' 
<br>
type of process, which I suppose holds analog above the merely digital. Yet 
<br>
this analog, as far as life goes seems impossible without cellular topology. 
<br>
Sounds a bit like Penrose and Hameroff's digital function in the human 
<br>
brain-except that its more, analog. Hmmm.
<br>
<p>&quot;The difference between combinatorial and digital coding of information is 
<br>
that when information is coded digitally all the possible states of the 
<br>
memory are equally accessible. When information is coded combinatorially, say 
<br>
in the knotting of some graphs, this is not the case, the time required to 
<br>
store or retrieve information depends very strongly on the state in which the 
<br>
information is coded. But a cell is not a general purpose computer, and there 
<br>
is no need that all possible configurations of the molecules where 
<br>
information is stored be equally accessible. What is required is only access 
<br>
to those states that are relevant for the functioning of the cell, and then 
<br>
only at the time they are needed. (Similarly the protein folding problem does 
<br>
not have to have a solution for arbitrary amino acid sequences, only for the 
<br>
much smaller subset that are relevant biologically.) So I do wonder whether 
<br>
the digital metaphor may be blinding us to ways in which information could be 
<br>
stored in biological systems using the combinatorics and topology of 
<br>
molecules.&quot;
<br>
<p>Smolin uses this combinatoric concept to address Dyson's on life and the 
<br>
future of the universe (Infinite In All Directions -1979).
<br>
<p>&quot;This seems relevant for Freeman's worry, for if information can be stored in 
<br>
the topology of a system, then the system can be cooled or expanded 
<br>
arbitrarily without degrading the information. At the very least, if the 
<br>
universe has non-trivial topology, on either the large or small scale, there 
<br>
are possibilities for storage of combinatorial information where the 
<br>
discreteness of the states are maintained for arbitrarily low energies. At 
<br>
worst life will be able to survive by coding itself into the quantum geometry 
<br>
of space itself. &quot;     &lt;--My underlining. For additional opinions on Dyson's 
<br>
digital v. analog and life:
