<p>No the problem seems to be, that there couldn't possibly be anything wrong
<br>
with your behavior, therefore my criticisms of you must be personal attacks.
<br>
You seem to be incapable of learning from the feedback being offered up by
<br>
pretty much everyone here.
<br>
<p>As for malice, what do you call this?
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, let me turn that around, if I may, by asking: What do humans 
<br>
consider to be the most common errors made by extropians? 
<br>
<p>Speaking as one of the former, I'd have to say (as a generalization, 
<br>
of course; there are notable exceptions) a tendency to 
<br>
overintellectualize everything to the point of absurdity, 
<br>
overreliance on what I would term material reductionism to the point 
<br>
of rabidity; overt hostility to differing viewpoints and to criticism 
<br>
(however mild) to the point of ridiculosity; technophilia to the 
<br>
point of fanaticism. 
<br>
<p>In short--they're not ready for prime time. &quot;
<br>
<p>def. of malice: &quot;Enmity of heart; malevolence; ill will; a spirit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delighting in harm or misfortune to another; a disposition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to injure another;&quot;
<br>
<p>That seems to fit your general observed behavior in many cases. But I
<br>
will desist now since none of this is getting through. Just keep putting
<br>
your own faults onto others, I'm sure that will work great for you.
