The following is some material from one of the radical green lists I monitor 
<br>
about a book that's being gushed over in those circles.  Anyone read it?

<br>
<p>Redesigning Life?  The Worldwide Challenge to Genetic Engineering
<br>
Edited by Brian Tokar
<br>
<a href="http://www.zedbooks.demon.co.uk/autumn2000long.htm">http://www.zedbooks.demon.co.uk/autumn2000long.htm</a>
<br>
(A Canadian edition from McGill-Queens University Press and an Australian
<br>
edition from Scribe Publications will be available shortly.)
<br>
<p>Genetic engineering, animal cloning and new reproductive technologies are
<br>
being promoted as the keys to a brighter future. Genetic engineers promise
<br>
a more productive agriculture, wondrous medical miracles and solutions to
<br>
our most pressing environmental problems.  But growing numbers of farmers,
<br>
scientists and concerned citizens disagree, citing new hazards to our
<br>
health and the environment, along with troubling ethical questions.
<br>
<p>This book offers the most comprehensive examination to date of the hidden
<br>
hazards of the new genetic technologies, and the emergence of worldwide
<br>
resistance. Twenty-six internationally respected critics, offer their
<br>
analysis of the issues, their social and ethical implications, and the
<br>
stories that lie behind the headlines that have brought genetic engineering
<br>
to the forefront of public controversy.
<br>
<p>____________________________________________________________________
<br>
| The hazards of genetic engineering are among the most critical   |
<br>
| threats facing us. Knowledge is power. This book gives us power. |

<br>
<p>'This book provides a welcome perspective that is missing from all the
<br>
biotechnology hype. For anyone concerned about the real implications and
<br>
potential hazards of gene manipulation, it is an excellent starting point.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- David Suzuki, host of The Nature of Things
<br>
<p>'In this wide-ranging collection, scientists and activists discuss the
<br>
pressing issues growing out of the wanton commercialization of the life
<br>
sciences. . . An excellent guide to the brave new world of genetic
<br>
engineering and to effective ways to counter and transcend it.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Ruth Hubbard, Professor Emerita of Biology at Harvard University
<br>
and Board Member of the Council for Responsible Genetics
<br>
<p>'This book explains why and how genetic engineering is adversely affecting
<br>
our food, health, environment and human rights. It also shows what people
<br>
are doing to counter the technology and the industry. It must be read by
<br>
the public everywhere and by policymakers, especially in developing
<br>
countries.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Martin Khor, Director, Third World Network
