<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You're switching gears on me Michael. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; original position was that there

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; saying (merely) that there is no good reason for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; socialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The contradiction is that socialism decries the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corporation siphons a part of the laborers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; productive output to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; management and capital, as if this confiscation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; injustice. It then goes on to presume that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perfectly alright for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society to confiscate the productive output of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laborer. The best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arguments it can make for such confiscation hinge on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'repaying the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generations' for the labor they invested in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; current infrastructure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; while they ignore that this is the ENTIRE purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for which the cost of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capital serves. Is this clear enough?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is clear that you not only don't &quot;understand them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [the ideas of anarchism] far better than the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals who wrote that page&quot;, you don't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the most basic precepts of anarchism.  From
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the introduction of the FAQ:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the meanings of words change over time. Today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;socialism&quot; almost always refers to state socialism, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that all anarchists have opposed as a denial of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom and genuine socialist ideals. All anarchists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would agree with Noam Chomsky's statement on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If the left is understood to include 'Bolshevism,'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I would flatly dissociate myself from the left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lenin was one of the greatest enemies of socialism.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [&quot;Anarchism, Marxism and Hope for the Future&quot;, Red and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Black Revolution, no. 2]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anarchism developed in constant opposition to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas of Marxism, social democracy and Leninism. Long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before Lenin rose to power, Mikhail Bakunin warned the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followers of Marx against the &quot;Red bureaucracy&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would institute &quot;the worst of all despotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments&quot; if Marx's state-socialist ideas were ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented. Indeed, the works of Stirner, Proudhon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and especially Bakunin all predict the horror of state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialism with great accuracy. In addition, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchists were among the first and most vocal critics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and opposition to the Bolshevik regime in Russia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Requoting from my original post (which you obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't read):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://infoshop.org/faq/secB3.html#secb31">http://infoshop.org/faq/secB3.html#secb31</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B.3.1 What is the difference between private property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and possession?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anarchists define &quot;private property&quot; (or just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;property,&quot; for short) as state-protected monopolies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of certain objects or privileges which are used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit others. &quot;Possession,&quot; on the other hand, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of things that are not used to exploit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others (e.g. a car, a refrigerator, a toothbrush,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.). Thus many things can be considered as either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property or possessions depending on how they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used. For example, a house that one lives in is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possession, whereas if one rents it to someone else at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a profit it becomes property. Similarly, if one uses a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw to make a living as a self-employed carpenter, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw is a possession; whereas if one employs others at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wages to use the saw for one's own profit, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While it may initially be confusing to make this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction, it is very useful to understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of capitalist society. Capitalists tend to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the word &quot;property&quot; to mean anything from a toothbrush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a transnational corporation -- two very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, with very different impacts upon society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, the &quot;community&quot; won't &quot;own&quot; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers unless you give your computers away.
</em><br>
<p>I've read the 'anarchist FAQ' several times. This 'qualification'
<br>
delineating 'posession' from 'property' still follows the contradiction
<br>
I point out: that the state or the community can confiscate the output
<br>
of the individual's labor when it is in excess of what that individual
<br>
needs to survive. If I save up money to buy a second house which I then
<br>
rent out to others, I am utilizing the fruit of my own labor.
<br>
Confiscating the fruits of that labor, preventing me from investing my
<br>
savings thusly, is slavery.
