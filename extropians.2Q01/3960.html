<em>&gt; Apart from having a message board where people can sign up to say that they

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Well if people dared, you could get their cell phone numbers and include
<br>
a listing of those in the packet of materials. You could also give a phone
<br>
to whoever is manning the public board so people could call in there to
<br>
announce newly formed lunch meetings so others have a chance to meet up.
