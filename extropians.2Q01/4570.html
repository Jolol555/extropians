</em><br>
<p>Ah, *but* - NASA doesn't do any significant cost optimization, choosing
<br>
instead to worry only about safety.  (For instance, to fix a minor
<br>
wiring problem found once the shuttle's on the pad ready for liftoff,
<br>
procedures dictate that the shuttle must be hauled back to the hangar
<br>
on a slow tractor, even if the fault could just as easily be fixed on
<br>
the pad directly.  This then causes all kinds of delays to highly
<br>
scheduled activities.)  Note the use of &quot;significant&quot;: they have
<br>
undoubtedly done some efforts at this, with at least $0.01 resulting
<br>
savings, but compared to how well they could do it with no loss of
<br>
safety...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It now gets interesting, if you view the launch facilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as sunk costs (paid for by the taxpayers, satellite launches,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.) are we starting to get to the era where the cost
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; by perhaps 0.0004% of the people in the first world if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you fly from the third world?  What is the size of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground control team that you need if you are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circling the Earth?
</em><br>
<p>For which vehicle?  There are designs that would require zero ground
<br>
control.  (They may require communication with the ground, say to
<br>
inform the customer that their satellite has been deployed, but if one
<br>
can equip the orbiter with communication gear that can place a call
<br>
through some provider's usually-communicating-with-the-ground phone
<br>
satellites...)
<br>
<p>That said, a lot of this comes down to procedures and practices of the
<br>
organization that operates the orbiter, more than the orbiter itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think Tito's trip is going to have a big impact as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a paradigm breaker.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  I'd go so far as to say the paradigm was broken already; he
<br>
just proved it.
