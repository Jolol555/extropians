I picked this up at the local Barnes &amp; Noble over the
<br>
weekend:
<br>

<br>
<p>It's some candy to distract me from _IBM and the Holocaust_,
<br>
which has become a bit of a slog.  The author is a science
<br>
journalist (author of _The Myth of Irrationality: The Science
<br>
of the Mind From Plato to Star Trek_, which strikes me as
<br>
an auspicious title ;-&gt;), and the tone is breezy and slightly
<br>
irreverent, which should prove entertaining.
<br>
<p>I went straight to the index and found the following bit
<br>
of gossip about Gerald M. Edelman (Chapter 8, &quot;The Needs
<br>
that Shape the Brain&quot;, pp. 166-170):
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p>Good timing is the secret to a lot of things.  Late in the 1980s,
<br>
a Nobel prize-winning immunologist trying to revolutionize the
<br>
mind sciences with a more dynamic approach to consciousness
<br>
managed to attract an awful lot of bad press.  In a gathering of
<br>
neuroscientists, the mere mention of Gerald Edelman's name was
<br>
enough to send eyes rolling heavenward.
<br>
<p>A New Yorker, famous for his intense manner, patrician bearing,
<br>
and highflown tastes (he once trained to be a concert violinist[*]),
<br>
Edelman won a Nobel prize for medical research in 1972.  Then,
<br>
like Francis Crick, Edelman decided to branch out and tackle the
<br>
bigger question of human consciousness.  But whereas Crick spent
<br>
most of his time visiting other people's labs, learning about
<br>
what they were doing and helping to tease out the implications of
<br>
their research, Edelman wanted to have his own set-up and pursue
<br>
his own vision of the brain.
<br>
<p>A charismatic figure, Edelman proved adept at drumming up
<br>
sponsorship.  Eventually, enough money was raised to found the
<br>
Neurosciences Institute, a $16 million 'monastery of science'
<br>
built into a hillside at the Scripps Research Institute in
<br>
southern California.  The cash paid for wet labs to study
<br>
neurology and dry labs for computer simulations of brain
<br>
circuits.  Edelman could also afford thirty full-time staff.  For
<br>
other neuroscientists, it was bad enough that a complete outsider
<br>
was getting his own lab, free of any of the usual teaching
<br>
responsibilities or funding constraints.  But what really raised
<br>
hackles was that Edelman was talking as if he had already
<br>
discovered the secret of consciousness.  Interviewed in the _New
<br>
Yorker_ magazine, Edelman said that the mainstream of mind
<br>
science -- dominated as it was by the computational model -- was
<br>
so far off the mark as to be 'not even wrong'.  His own big idea
<br>
was that brain processing was based on neural competition.
<br>
States of consciousness evolved through exactly the same kind of
<br>
classical Darwinian mechanisms that drove the evolution of life.
<br>
<p>In a trilogy of densely argued books published between 1987 and
<br>
1989 [_Neural Darwinism: The Theory of Neuronal Group Selection_
<br>
(1987), _Topobiology: An Introduction to Molecular Embryology_
<br>
(1988), _The Remembered Present: A Biological Theory of
<br>
Consciousness_ (1989)], Edelman laid out his manifesto for Neural
<br>
Darwinism, or TNGS, the theory of neuronal group selection.
<br>
Edelman wrote that just as animals compete for food and living
<br>
space in the struggle for life, so sensations had to compete for
<br>
space in the mapping surfaces of the brain.  Every moment would
<br>
begin with a battle in which some networks of activity would
<br>
blossom, gaining the neural territory needed to become conscious-
<br>
level percepts, while other, weaker, nerve-ensembles withered
<br>
away.  Crucially, one of the factors determining the success or
<br>
failure of a new sensation was the support it received from
<br>
higher levels of the brain.  If a sensation was anticipated, or
<br>
deemed important in some other way, positive feedback from higher
<br>
areas would help swell the mapping activity, elevating it above
<br>
the general clamour.  Edelman called this feedback between
<br>
levels of processing a 're-entrant circuit'.
<br>
<p>Another essential point that Edelman felt the rest of
<br>
neuroscience was missing was that it was quite wrong to think of
<br>
the brain as a lump of fixed hardware.  He saw that it was
<br>
incredibly plastic -- plastic on every timescale, from the
<br>
fleeting instant of a neural firing pattern, through the
<br>
minute-by-minute and day-by-day rewiring changes that create
<br>
memory traces, right out to the developmental competition needed
<br>
to wire the brain's pathways during childhood, and even the
<br>
genetic timescale changes of ordinary evolution.  The brain might
<br>
look to have a stable design, but -- as Merzenich's work with
<br>
finger maps in monkeys had showed -- it is in a constant state of
<br>
flux, forever changing its connection patterns as a result of
<br>
internal selection and competition.  In short, brain circuitry
<br>
flowed to meet the processing demands being placed upon it.
<br>
<p>This struck Edelman as a beautiful idea.  It meant that there was
<br>
a continuum tying consciousness back to biology.  Exactly the
<br>
same selectionist principles ruled at every level of the brain's
<br>
operation and only the pace of the adaptation varied.
<br>
Genetic-level adjustments in the organisation of the brain
<br>
happened with glacial slowness, while the neural competition to
<br>
map the contents of a moment would flare and collapse in the
<br>
blink of an eye.  Yet the identical mechanism of 'processing
<br>
through adaptation' applied.
<br>
<p>This hierarchy in adaptive levels made consciousness seem a lot
<br>
easier to explain.  The story of the animal brain would be one of
<br>
a gradual increase in the speed of its competition-based
<br>
adjustments.  Simple animals, like worms and jellyfish, could
<br>
only adapt their nervous systems over generations.  Slightly
<br>
smarter animals, like slugs and snails, could make the nerve
<br>
junction growth changes that gave them a rudimentary ability to
<br>
remember and learn -- a sort of reflex-level awareness.  Then,
<br>
further up the evolutionary scale, animals become capable of
<br>
creating fleeting mental maps of the world.  In under a second
<br>
they could evolve a change in brain state, a disturbance to a
<br>
memory landscape in response to a fresh wave of sensory input.
<br>
So consciousness turned out to be just a further twist in an old
<br>
evolutionary tale.  It was the result of speeding up the adaptive
<br>
abilities of the brain until its circuitry became able to adjust
<br>
to the events of a single moment.
<br>
<p>The evolutionary angle on consciousness came naturally to Edelman
<br>
because of his own work in immunology.  Edelman's Nobel prize had
<br>
come from helping prove that immune cells are produced through a
<br>
selectionist competition.  The problem for the body is that it
<br>
cannot predict what kinds of bugs or viruses it might face in
<br>
life, so its solution is to manufacture a huge and rather random
<br>
variety of immune cell types.  All these cells float in the
<br>
bloodstream.  Then, when there is an invader, whichever immune
<br>
cell happens to have the right response characteristics will be
<br>
stimulated to reproduce itself in great numbers, rapidly swamping
<br>
the disease.
<br>
<p>The principle of selection seemed so elegant and powerful that
<br>
when Edelman decided to give the problem of consciousness a go,
<br>
it appeared obvious that as a biological system, the same sort of
<br>
logic must be at work in the brain.  So Edelman was rather
<br>
shocked when he found that the Darwinian model did not seem to
<br>
feature at all in the computer-obsessed thinking of psychology
<br>
and neuroscience.  With typical vigour, Edelman tried hard to
<br>
point this out.  But he got little thanks.  In a snub that
<br>
typified the general response, Crick coolly remarked that Edelman
<br>
was an enthusiast notable more for the exuberance of his ideas
<br>
than for their clarity.  Backs were turned on him, and
<br>
researchers resumed their search for the neural code or
<br>
topographical mapping principles by which the brain must process
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>It was true, of course, that Edelman made some presentational
<br>
mistakes.  He invented a lot of his own jargon for concepts that
<br>
already seemed to exist, using words like 're-entrant' which did
<br>
not appear to add a lot to the idea of ordinary feedback.  Still
<br>
more of a problem was that his use of the Darwinian metaphor made
<br>
him sound curiously outdated.  By the end of the 1980s, anyone
<br>
thinking seriously about neural competition or evolution was
<br>
already hurrying to jump aboard the new intellectual vehicle
<br>
provided by the sciences of chaos and complexity.  So while for
<br>
some Edelman was a step too far, for others he already seemed a
<br>
step behind.  A much broader revolution was in the offing.  For
<br>
Edelman, the timing was all wrong.
<br>
<p>The tale of Gerald Edelman is not important apart from what it
<br>
says about the state of the mind sciences at the outset of the
<br>
1990s.  The history of science is littered with individuals who
<br>
seemed to have had a considerable personal understanding of the
<br>
dynamic nature of the brain and the way it works.  Brilliant
<br>
theorists like Wundt, Hebb, and Neisser -- and many others not so
<br>
far mentioned, such as the Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Kohler,
<br>
or the Russian physiologist Evgeny Sokolov -- have briefly opened
<br>
the door to a way of thinking that might have led the study of
<br>
the mind in quite a different direction.  Yet the time was never
<br>
ripe.  To most people, the standard reductionist view of
<br>
information processing always seemed to be working well enough --
<br>
it was getting more things right than wrong -- so there was no
<br>
recognition of a need for change.
<br>
<p>However, just a few years into the 1990s, the mind sciences did
<br>
begin to see that groundswell shift in opinion.  Everywhere they
<br>
looked, researchers were discovering troublesome facts.  Scanning
<br>
showed too much activity in the brain; single-cell recording
<br>
showed too much plasticity; the simple models of cognitive
<br>
science were just not fitting.  And suddenly, the sciences of
<br>
chaos and complexity were offering a genuine alternative to
<br>
reductionism, a way of thinking about an evolving system that was
<br>
backed up by solid maths.
<br>
<p>The change was certainly not universal.  As is the way with all
<br>
revolutions, it was the young researchers with nothing to lose
<br>
who made the more fervent converts.  And the change did not show
<br>
through with great clarity.  It was easy enough for academics
<br>
like Friston or Kosslyn to get across what they meant in private
<br>
conversation, where they could flutter their hands a bit or point
<br>
at a nearby pond, but much harder to say the same things in the
<br>
formal language of peer-reviewed articles.  However, gradually a
<br>
more dynamic view filtered into the mainstream of thought so that
<br>
by the mid-1990s it had become difficult to find anyone who would
<br>
disagree with at least the essence of what Edelman had been
<br>
trying to say.&quot;
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p>[*] Edelman's interest in music is obvious from some of the
<br>
anecdotes scattered through his books, for example:
<br>
<p>&quot;Writing about these properties [of memory: association,
<br>
inexactness, and generalization], I am reminded of the contrast
<br>
between different gifted individuals in their approach to memory
<br>
and performance.  A story told about Fritz Kreisler, the great
<br>
violinist, and Sergei Rachmaninoff, the great pianist, provides
<br>
a case in point.  In 1930, they met in Berlin to record the
<br>
Grieg C Minor Sonata together.  Rachmaninoff was a meticulous
<br>
worker and wanted to practice right away.  Kreisler, who didn't
<br>
practice much, was not so assiduous and went out on the town.  The
<br>
next morning, at Kreisler's insistence and with Rachmaninoff's
<br>
reluctance, the recording took place; it went well.  (It is
<br>
still available, I believe, and is stunning.)

<br>
Nonetheless, Rachmaninoff was not pleased.
<br>
<p>Somewhat later that year, the story goes, the two played together
<br>
in New York, and the program included the same sonata.
<br>
Somewhere in the course of a movement, Kreisler had a memory
<br>
lapse.  Being Kreisler, he simply made up some cadences,
<br>
probably in the hope of picking up the thread later.  When that
<br>
didn't happen after a minute or so, he leaned over, still
<br>
playing, and asked, 'Sergei, where are we?'  Rachmaninoff
<br>
looked up from the keyboard and said, 'Carnegie Hall.'&quot;
