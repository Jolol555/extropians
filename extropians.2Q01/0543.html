<br>
<p>One bias that seems to pervade your thought is that human &quot;phenomenal
<br>
consciousness&quot; as the only valid instantiation, which at the very least
<br>
would appear to be a rather gross assumption.  Intelligent machines by their
<br>
nature would use very different internal representations of reality than
<br>
people.  Who is to say that a machine doesn't have the same phenomenal
<br>
experience from a sequence of bits in its detectors, something you has a
<br>
human find to be very mechanical?  Even today, if you look at sophisticated
<br>
processors you will find that rather innocuous and simple data streams can
<br>
produce a multitude of very distinctive and complicated states within the
<br>
processor.  Some of these states can momentarily change the qualitative
<br>
nature of the processing and the context of incoming data.  How is this
<br>
substantially different, other than being a primitive yet extraordinarily
<br>
complicated bit of finite state machinery?
