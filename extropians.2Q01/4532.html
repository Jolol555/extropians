<p>Of course I did bring that out. Big deal: just read &quot;Thrice Upon a Time&quot; by James
<br>
P. Hogan. Nihil nova, and stuff. It is all very obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, a Bootstrap Scenario would ensue.

<p>It is worse, you've got a loop of Final Cause (the Antipode of the First 
<br>
Cause) keeping reaching back, and restructuring the timeline. Iteratively. 
<br>
Not only is this bootstrap, this is autofeedback. The capabilities are nudged
<br>
backwards with each increment. The initial kinetics dynamics is limited, 
<br>
but I have no idea how limited. Even if you're getting back &quot;only&quot; 
<br>
information, you might be very surprised what you might be 
<br>
getting back from scant few hours into the future. I don't know what a 
<br>
Deity from the End of Time can accomplish with a current state of the 
<br>
world, if given an hour (or a day, or a year, it doesn't really matter),
<br>
&nbsp;but it will be probably a lot. Good chance is that you won't like it.
<br>
<p>If it looks like optical FastEthernet traffic coming out from the 
<br>
Bose-Einstein condensate portal, do *not* hook it up to the network.
<br>
At least, have the good sense of only connecting this to a sacrificial 
<br>
machine. I.e., do not use that machine for anything, ever.&lt;/eliezer-mode&gt;
<br>
<p>If the portal is traversable by matter, you're fucked, plain and simple.
<br>
<p>As I said, Star Trek this ain't. Time travel is one of the 
<br>
&quot;indistinguishable from magic&quot; technology candidates.
