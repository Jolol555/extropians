<p>#I agree that it COULD be a voice, perhaps THE voice for concepts of 
<br>
staggering import--which makes it that much more important to attempt 
<br>
to point these things out. At the moment, however, based upon what 
<br>
I've seen here, it would be a serious mistake--a disaster, in fact--
<br>
to present this assemblage as the forefront, the last great hope, or 
<br>
even a representative sampling of TH. This is so not because of the 
<br>
views of the majority, which are largely unexpressed, but because it 
<br>
is the views of the most vocal minority which serve to inform (or 
<br>
misinform) the opinions of those new to the subject. And it is a 
<br>
truism that the media in general seek out the most extreme voices to 
<br>
&quot;sell copy.&quot; 
<br>
<p>#I would not direct those interested in learning about TH here 
<br>
without some sort of warning. Sad but true.
