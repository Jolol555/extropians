<p>I had a feeling this parenthesis might be an impertinence

even as I was inserting it.  I also managed to make my opening

sentence harder to parse by leaving out the right paren, and I

got the author's name wrong.  It should have read:

</em><br>
<p>Eliezer says about the &quot;Great Holy Book&quot; (_Godel, Escher, Bach_) &quot;This
<br>
book is mandatory reading for all members of the human species.&quot;  Dare
<br>
I confess I haven't read it?  Of course, I listened to people saying all
<br>
through the 80's how wonderful it is, but the title immediately put me off.
<br>
The suggestion &quot;I'm a wunderkind mathematician and computer scientist,
<br>
but I know all about art too, and I'm going to show you how the former
<br>
illuminates the latter while dazzling you with my erudition&quot;
<br>
simultaneously filled me with jealousy that the author might actually
<br>
be that smart, fear that he might not be able to carry it off, and
<br>
anticipation of possibly being bored stiff watching him try.  For some
<br>
reason, the barrier has persisted to this day, even after people
<br>
whose judgment I trust have glowingly recommended the book, and after
<br>
it has become a classic.  My friend Joe Fineman used to have a color
<br>
picture of the young Hofstadter at the blackboard (greenboard),
<br>
clipped from a newspaper magazine supplement (the Sunday _New York
<br>
Times_, maybe), tacked up over his desk (along with a picture of
<br>
Richard Stallman taped to the side of his computer monitor), which I
<br>
can still see in my mind's eye.  Oh well.  Maybe I'll get over it
<br>
(or maybe not!).  I haven't read the Drexler book, either.
<br>
I'm a fake, a total fraud!! ;-&gt;
