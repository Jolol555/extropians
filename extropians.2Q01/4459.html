<p>First two eps were pretty good. The cloning episode on Tuesday was a
<br>
schemozzle. A Raelian facing a professional Christian dour-gooder, with
<br>
poor Prof Alan Trounson (surely a future Nobel laureate) trying to say
<br>
useful things about epigenetic switches being munged in current cloning
<br>
experiments. I can't imagine why they didn't invite a $cientologist and a
<br>
witchdoctor as well to provide well-considered ethical and scientific
<br>
opinions.
<br>
<p>After seeing the first two eps (I participated in the second), I'd rather
<br>
chided myself for not allowing them to name the series THE SPIKE, as was
<br>
suggested at one point. Now I'm intensely grateful to my own caution.
<br>
<p>I mean, people think extropes are weird. A fucking *Raelian*! You all know
<br>
about them, I suppose? Life on earth was created by ETs using cloning (of
<br>
what? some primordial slime the greys just happened to have stuck to the
<br>
treads of their UFOs?), and we'll use accelerated cloning to create perfect
<br>
physical copies of ourselves, and then nanotech will copy our brain
<br>
structures into these compliant shells (a.k.a. our twins, who will thereby
<br>
be brain-murdered, but hey, get an eternal life you moralizing dolt) and
<br>
we'll go out into space where our forecritters live. Wow, thanks for
<br>
bringing us that really interesting information.
<br>
<p>And of course the rotating smashcut graphics were all of hairless plastic
<br>
mannequins exactly alike, even though everyone kept saying `It would be a
<br>
stupid and vulgar mistake to imagine that delayed twins are *carbon copies
<br>
of you*...'
<br>
<p>I'm hoping to see Emlyn appear in a crushed aluminium foil suit, insisting
<br>
that he's beamed back here from the future to prevent the cloning of Jesus,
<br>
which went terribly wrong and caused all the oceans to turn to rather pissy
<br>
and undrinkable wine.
