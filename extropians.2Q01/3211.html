</em><br>
<p>First to Gnutella: it has not been designed to cloak the identities of
<br>
their participants. You just join the network, ask for a few appropriately
<br>
named files, obtain from which IP addresses they come from, do a DNS
<br>
lookup, document it all and delegate the rest to the legal department. 
<br>
No packet sniffing whatsoever necessary.
<br>
<p>Pulling this stunt is much harder with traffic remixer type of anonymous 
<br>
publishing systems, such as Freenet and MojoNation, which can be also 
<br>
protected by above steganographic means from real packet sniffing at 
<br>
the ISP, though they would have still to designed to resist statistic 
<br>
traffic analysis. You can still smoke out the IPs of the parties you're
<br>
directly connected to, though, so you would typically want to make
<br>
legal links which go over legal boundaries, so thus each act of ripping
<br>
a node from the grid will have to see maximum amount of administrative
<br>
friction. As usually, it helps not being stupid, and anticipate the
<br>
next moves of your adversaries.
<br>
<p>Another way of going civilly disobedient is to become your own ISP
<br>
(see Consume Net and similiar efforts), creating user-owned networks 
<br>
using commodity IEEE 802.11b wireless networking, and forthcoming 
<br>
successors (next generation is ramping up to 55 MBps already;
<br>
I'm looking forward to digital pulse radio, which is right now 
<br>
stalled at FCC due to bitching &amp; moaning from the side of GPS folks, who
<br>
rightfully suspect it would put them out of business in a double whammy:
<br>
by degrading their quality, simultaneously offering better positioning
<br>
services _and_ wireless networking).
