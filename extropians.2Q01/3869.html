</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not super-sure myself, but what about the following?
<br>
All the functionalists that I know agree that a TM would be
<br>
conscious if executing the right program.  Now, this may have
<br>
to include being in the right situation, and may have to
<br>
include being able to respond to multiple possible inputs.
<br>
<p>Whatever.  It was shown by Charles Bennett that any computation
<br>
can be accomplished reversibly.  In &quot;Minds, Machines, and the
<br>
Multiverse&quot;, Julian Brown even says, &quot;The idea that one can 
<br>
compute using no energy at all may sound too good to be true,
<br>
but remarkably enough, it seems that it is possible, in theory
<br>
at any rate.  This conclusion not only has important practical
<br>
implications but also offers a new vista of the relationship
<br>
between computation and physics&quot;.  (I'm not sure how much to
<br>
read into that: could a developing civilization go on for
<br>
eons with zero energy expenditure?  Somehow, I doubt it.)
<br>
<p>In any case, I think that a Turing machine would be just
<br>
as conscious of an experience as it un-calculated as it
<br>
was when it calculated.  What persuaded me is that the
<br>
un-calculation is exactly what would transpire if the
<br>
arrow of time were reversed;  but the direction of the
<br>
arrow of time is symmetrical (i.e., there's no place to
<br>
stand and claim that it's going now one way, and now the
<br>
other).  So un-experiencing something would be just as
<br>
fun as experiencing it... not &quot;un-fun&quot; at all!
