It does indeed seem we're living in different dimensions, so I'll try 
<br>
to explain what happened in mine: I have not attempted to strike. 
<br>
Some guy named Brian comes at me out of the blue, swinging with both 
<br>
fists (albeit missing with both)--then stalks off claiming the high 
<br>
ground. Most curious indeed. I do hope his &quot;bubble&quot; doesn't burst.
