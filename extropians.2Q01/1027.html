<p>You'd think so, if you had never worked on an aircraft or spacecraft
<br>
before. While I've not worked on spacecraft, I have worked on many
<br>
different aircraft. On large planes like transports/airliners, the wire
<br>
bundles running through the wings can easily exceed the diameter of your
<br>
leg, with hundreds or thousands of wires, and a minimum of several dozen
<br>
up to several hundred 'Cannon' plug connectors. And this is just the
<br>
wiring. You also have environmental ducting, as well as suplly and drain
<br>
lines for water, sewage, any gasses required, plus signalling/avionics
<br>
cables (co-ax, bi-ax, tri-axial cabling, fiber-optics, etc.)
<br>
<p>As someone else commented, on Mir, you can see from photos of much
<br>
tubing, ducting, and cabline going through the compartment interface
<br>
tunnels of the difficulty of running it all straight through from
<br>
compartment to compartment via the access hatches, not so much in
<br>
setting up the station this way (its probably very cheap to do it this
<br>
way), but in the problems with shutting the hatches if one compartment
<br>
has a catastrophic leak. This was done in Mir because the USSR's space
<br>
suit technology was primitive compared to the US, requiring several
<br>
hours of suit-up time with limited run-time, and so EVAs were kept to a
<br>
minimum. Working in US suits is far more pleasant, and easier to prepare
<br>
for than the older technology.
<br>
<p>Each lab has its own circuitry, and over the period of the construction
<br>
of the full station (at least the next 10 years), modules will be
<br>
unplugged and shuffled around at least a couple times, so each interface
<br>
hatch cannot simultaneously carry interface plugs in the hatch to work
<br>
with all possible modules it might come in contact with. Better to have
<br>
the cable interfaces separate and do the wiring on the outside, leaving
<br>
the hatchways free for shutting in emergency situations.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its fascinating if you go over this design.  You have the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Destiny lab, then the ESA lab, then the Japanese lab, then a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of Russian labs.  What precisely are all these labs going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do?  What can the labs do that hasn't already been done on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the the Mir or Spacelab?  Have you looked at the prices that NASA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipates charging for the hourly allocation of an astronaut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a &quot;lab operator&quot;?  Makes hourly rates for lawyers and doctors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look positively &quot;minimum wage&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The whole thing has a bad smell.  In contrast if you positioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as an orbiting observatory platform or an &quot;assembly&quot; operation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you would be getting something from it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer this -- why can't one attach a couple of dozen Baby Hubble's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the space station?  Is there some orbital difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Hubble and the ISS that makes it unusable as an observatory?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it simply not stable enough?  What gives here?
