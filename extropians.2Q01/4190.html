Mark Galecki wrote regarding &quot;Fun With Bayes' Theorem&quot;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Lee Corbin says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2.  A little girl's father discovers that his wife is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     pregnant again (but they don't know the sex of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     unborn child).  The man decides to visit a mathematician.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     &quot;I have two children, sir&quot;, he says, &quot;and one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     is a girl.  What is the probability that the other is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     a boy?&quot;  What did the mathematician tell him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ***Answers***   For problems 1, 2, and 3, the answer is 2/3.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;One has to be careful about formulation of the problem.  Lee wants to ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;given that there is at least one girl, what is the probability that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is one boy and one girl&quot;.  The answer to this is of course 2/3, just as Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, this is not what Lee is really asking.  Note the pair of phrases:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;one&quot;, and &quot;the other&quot;.  What the father is really asking is &quot;I have picked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one of my children (not necessarily at random). That child is a girl.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the probability that the other child is a boy&quot;.  To this question the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answer is 1/2.
</em><br>
<p>The flaw in your argument is that the mathematician is obligated to
<br>
entertain no hypotheses concerning the procedure by which the parent
<br>
determined the truth or falsity of the statement &quot;one of my children
<br>
is a girl&quot;.  The only thing that matters is whether the statement is
<br>
true.  It's not the case that the father is saying &quot;I have picked...&quot;.
<br>
<p>The mathematician's sample space in this case consists firstly of
<br>
all parents in the universe, then that set restricted to all parents
<br>
having two children, and then finally that set in turn restricted to
<br>
all parents who have two children one of whom is a girl. If the
<br>
mathematician then assumes that each such parent in the universe
<br>
has an equal chance of being the particular parent in question,
<br>
it follows that in two cases out of three the parent's other
<br>
child will be a boy.
<br>
<p>It may help to consider that from the mathematician's perspective
<br>
there are actually three types of parents, not four.  There are
<br>
those with two girls, those with a girl and boy each, and those
<br>
with two boys.  It can be misleading to think that there are four
<br>
cases, namely GG, GB, BG, and BB, because one is then tempted to
<br>
infer some sort of order (although many people do go on from that
<br>
analysis to obtain the correct solution).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Of the three actual kinds, their weights are 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 
<br>
respectively. Since the last case has been excluded, it follows
<br>
that the probability is 2 in 3 that the mathematician is dealing
<br>
with a parent from the second category.  I've inflicted this
<br>
problem on numerous acquaintances since the time years ago
<br>
when I made it up.  But you have formatted the most substantial-
<br>
sounding objection I've heard.  Thanks for the critical thinking.
<br>
