<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  I am guessing that there are several reasons why Singapore succeeded 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;where Somalia, seems to remain a backwater.
</em><br>
1) There is order in Singapore because the peoples that comprise Singapore 
<br>
desire it.  Somalia hasn't gone up that hierarchy of needs yet.
<br>
2) There is a respect for learning in Singapore, in Somali-little. It's 
<br>
agrarian knowledge, at best. Agrarian knowledge in wonderful, but its not 
<br>
software coding.
<br>
3) There is the same unhappy mix of politics and religion, that has slowed 
<br>
many countries.
<br>
4) Somalia is more fractionalized amongst tribes and clans.
<br>
5) The transition of powers between regimes is not clear as it is in
<br>
Singapore.
<br>
Note:  with Singapore, there is still the authoritarian smell of 
<br>
dictatorship.
<br>
There is more hope that as the economy develops, the hunger for 
<br>
self-representation will occur.
<br>
The capitalist spirit is essential, but its comparative to growing a heart 
<br>
in vitro, and claiming it as a human personality. It's important, but there 
<br>
needs to be more. Is Somalia going down the road of development? I'd need 
<br>
more evidence to be convinced.
<br>
<p>Mitch  &gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>These are valid points, Mitch.  No quibble here.  The Chinese/Confucian 
<br>
emphasis on education has, I'm sure, played a big role in Singapore's rapid 
<br>
development (Singapore's population is something like 76% ethnic Chinese).
