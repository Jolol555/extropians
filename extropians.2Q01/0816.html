&quot;When I said there might be ethical prohibitions to running simulations of

human lives, what I had in mind was the fact that human life contains so 
<br>
much misery. I don't think there is anything immoral about creating 
<br>
simulations per se.&quot;
<br>
<p>I doubt anyone in this list and most people outside it would prefer to have 
<br>
never existed if they knew they were part of a simulation made by people 
<br>
that were much happier than we are. Despite all the misery that human life 
<br>
does have, most people are still happy for being given a chance to live, 
<br>
even if they go through hell to do so. So what does it matter if the people 
<br>
that make the simulation think that the conditions in it are inhuman, so 
<br>
long as those in it are satisfied? Besides, if life was all happiness, 
<br>
people would become bored. Otherwise, why would tragedy be so popular?
