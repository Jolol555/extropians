<em>&gt;&gt; You're right that the Mongol conquest was likely the catalytic event that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sent China into an introspective and deep conservatism.  However, the
</em><br>
seeds
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of Confucian orthodoxy were already there.  It only took the humbling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experience of conquest by the western barbarians to cause the
</em><br>
phase-change
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of ossification that locked China into almost a thousand years of stasis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Interestingly, a similar phenomenon happened with Islamic culture.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conquest of the Islamic heartland by Ghengis and his progeny also caused
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; premature closure of the Islamic world to new ideas from outside and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; innovation within their own cultural realm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So in the interests of continuing the ongoing western
</em><br>
<em>&gt;renaissance/enlightenment (or whatever we want to call it) we better keep
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt;eye out for anything that might cause such a closure. While Mongolian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invaders appear unlikely, we might need to look for some culture or group
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieving hegemony to such an extent that the dynamism of the enlightenment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(which is still driving us, thankfully, despite postmodern confusion) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One such possibility would be a resurgence of the romantic idea complex,
</em><br>
now
<br>
<em>&gt;empowered by connections with strong stasist groups. A green corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technocracy might be very dangerous (sounds a lot like something that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appear in the Alpha Centauri computer game :-) if it could develop. The
</em><br>
core
<br>
<em>&gt;of such a complex would be the idea of scarcity, the world as a
</em><br>
zero-sum-game
<br>
<em>&gt;and risk aversiveness, perhaps coupled with various essentialist ideas
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt;the natural (and possibly traditional or national) as the good.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is quite a possible scenario ( I agree there's not much chance
<br>
of nomad incursions these days) which is why the example of the Ming is
<br>
rather scary. They were able to eliminate several important technologies and
<br>
to restructure the economy (by reducing the role of money, going back to
<br>
peasant agriculture, discouraging or even banning long distance trade and
<br>
encouraging local self-sufficiency) in such a way as to eliminate the
<br>
dynamism of the T'ang and Sung for about 500 years. Point is we mustn't
<br>
think that technological dynamism or progress is irreversible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Our historical mission as extropians (sorry, I just wanted to test how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would feel to write that :-) is to make sure such closure scenarios doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happen. It can be done in several ways: first, we need to understand this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of closure better. We might develop technologies making it harder to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppress dissenting or free opinions and ideas. But we should remember that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even if you can think freely, if your entire culture (including your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upbringing) regards it is a worthless pursuit, then it will be hard to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any debate or change going. Most likely the best cultural defense is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural offense (thanks Natasha :-) both demonstrating the practical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral value of change, freedom and new directions, as well as hitting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stasist views hard with both subversive alternatives and criticism of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;core assumptions.
</em><br>
<p>Couldn't agree more - popular culture and art are enormously important in my
<br>
view. I would add one thing: divided political power-China was a one state
<br>
civilisation with no competing sovereignties (see Joel Mokyr's thoughts on
<br>
this in The Lever of Riches).
<br>
<p>I should introduce myself - I'm an historian in Manchester UK. I don't know
<br>
if it's unusual to find historians among extropians/transhumanists but then
<br>
I'm also a libertarian, SF fan and a congenital optimist (but then what else
<br>
can I be as a Manchester City supporter!). Steve Davies
