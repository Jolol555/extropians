<p>Its called academia, or the clique, or networking, or whatever. Its part of 
<br>
the pissy pool one has to swim in ;-)   The human brain is impossible to 
<br>
upload, because he doesn't want it, therefore its too difficult. It's like 
<br>
dealing with the Japanese Zaibatsu, when regarding becoming free-trade 
<br>
oriented; &quot;its very difficult..&quot;. The bad doctor might have been raised on 
<br>
wheat germ and granola, and no fossil fuels or nuclear fission, even though 
<br>
there is no working solar energy and fuel cell combo, that has successfully 
<br>
made it to market so far.  Its a prejudice, merely that, and nothing else. 
<br>
Something akin to racism.
