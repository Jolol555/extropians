John McCarthy wrote about progress: &quot;Humanity has progressed over hundreds
<br>
of thousands of years, but until about the seventeenth century, progress
<br>
was a rare event. There were novelties but a person would not expect a
<br>
whole sequence of improvements in his lifetime. Since then scientific
<br>
progress has been continual, and in the advanced parts of the world, there
<br>
has also been continued technological progress. Therefore, people no longer
<br>
expect the world to remain the same as it is.&quot;
<br>
<p>When we think of progress, we remember the Enlightenment.  When we look
<br>
back at  Transhumanity, we will think of the progress of progress.  What
<br>
does this mean to you?
<br>
<p>All comments welcome.
