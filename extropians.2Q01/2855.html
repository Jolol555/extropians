<p>It's of deep concern to me, as well.  As for the &quot;self-evidence&quot; of solutions 
<br>
by way of Promethean technologies, well, I don't know what kinds of things 
<br>
are really &quot;self-evident&quot; except maybe some forms of simple symbolic logic

operations :-)

<p>Right - my reaction to this fairly standard form of eco-doomism is based on 
<br>
two things.  First, the assumption that current modes of living will persist 
<br>
or spread unchanged is accepted without question.  Second, the solution - 
<br>
relinquishment - is offered with no more prescription than hand-waving and 
<br>
bromides.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, I'll assume you've made a simplistic sketch here, Damien, for effect.  
<br>
I and many others do not see a simple binary choice of futures that consists 
<br>
of either 1) eco-disaster brought on by a straight-line growth of the current 
<br>
first world mode of life versus 2) deus ex machina via instantaneous and 
<br>
immanent mega-hyper-mongo-Singularity.  I happen to think that neither of 
<br>
these two scenarios are the most likely.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I will leave critique of the second scenario for another day.  The first, 
<br>
however, utterly misses two &quot;self-evident&quot; facts: 1) rising resource prices 
<br>
cause increased efficiency of use and innovation and substitution and 2) 
<br>
trends in CURRENTLY existing technologies promise significant improvements 
<br>
and offer realistic promises of futures other than turning the entire Earth 
<br>
into a US suburb traveled by minivans and SUVs.
<br>
<p>Ms. Elliott misses the first point because she is ignorant of and hostile to 
<br>
capitalism.  She doesn't like it, so she is willfully ignorant of the 
<br>
simplest facts of how market mechanisms naturally create brakes on and 
<br>
innovation in resource utilization.  She misses the second point because she 
<br>
is ignorant of and hostile to technology.  She doesn't like it, so she is 
<br>
willfully ignorant of current trends in the development of existing 
<br>
technologies.  It requires no leap of Singularian faith to look for 
<br>
distributed photovoltaic power generation to bring major reductions in per 
<br>
capita fossil fuel consumption within no more than a couple of decades.  
<br>
Likewise, manufacturing techniques become more efficient over time.  Only a 
<br>
slight increase in the rate of efficiency increases - surely reasonable to 
<br>
expect - derail the runaway train to doom that Ms. Elliott and her ilk see us 
<br>
riding.  Will these factors create a utopia for every human while returning 
<br>
the Earth to an imagined state of Eden?  No.  Will they work to make the 
<br>
eco-apocalypse a less likely rather than a more likely scenario?  Yes.
