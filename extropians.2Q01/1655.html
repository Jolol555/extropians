Eugene hasn't turned strange, Eugene has been strange for a looooong time.

<p>So la la. Could be better, but thanks for asking.

<p>Insulting, yes. I'm a bastard that way. Condescending, no. I think you're
<br>
making a mistake, and need some advice. You might heed it or not, but I'll
<br>
say my piece one more time. 
<br>

<em>&gt; 1)  I already have the perfect job.  I would trade salaries with Bill
</em><br>
<p>Good, the qustions is: is this the perfect job on the long run, if you
<br>
want to produce results? There's a glut of terrific projects out there to
<br>
throw yourself onto, but you might at a later stage discover you've landed
<br>
in a cul de sac, which is terribly hard to backtrack. You need to work
<br>
with other people, and these people have expectations, resulting in a
<br>
sequence of windows of opportunity. This is for real. Plus, there's mental
<br>
hardware deterioration (which we can't fix yet, and may not be able to for
<br>
a long period of time). You *can* still get results at a later age, but
<br>
you'll have to labour a lot harder than while you're young.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gates, but not jobs.  I continue to work on the design, and when SIAI gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the funding to hire another four or five programmers we can start coding. 
</em><br>
<p>I've learned that much from Brian. Interesting project, good luck.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why on Earth would I want to drop that so I can go to a university and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start coding until I'm 25?
</em><br>
<p>You might discover that you can't code the fishes from the deep or the
<br>
Moon from the sky all on your own, however easy it may appear initially.
<br>
You will need to refer to work done by others, which you need to be aware
<br>
of. It will be worth of your time to study prior art, such as what happens
<br>
inside of our heads, at all levels of abstraction. You need to understand
<br>
the architecture of your target platform, as your task will involve
<br>
dealing with all layers, including hardware design. You'll need to
<br>
understand supercomputing, and parallelism. And whatever else might come
<br>
handy, which will be plenty.
<br>
<p>You don't learn such things by learning to code like a demon before you're
<br>
25. You'll get plenty of time to code before your're 25, just don't do it
<br>
exclusively. Read the journals and literature for at least a couple of
<br>
hours, but daily. This will be worth much more than coding (you can always
<br>
hire a good coder if your project is important enough for a lavish
<br>
budget, and eventually this will become a very large programme with a
<br>
rather intimidating budget).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2)  I'm 21 and already past your deadline.  Are you experiencing a
</em><br>
<p>You're past my deadline, that was my point. You're starting to lag,
<br>
though not badly yet. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; flashback to 1998 or something?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, that would be great, since giving me a couple extra years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eugene, you now know that I'm not going to go to a university.  Period.  I
</em><br>
<p>No, I did not knew that. Now I know, and I think it's a mistake you may
<br>
later come to regret. Making stuff that thinks is not at all like a
<br>
carreer in plumbing, where you can learn it on the job. There's value in
<br>
doing it madwand way at first, but sooner or later you'll need to check
<br>
out on all the stuff you've missed when discovering on your own. Unless
<br>
it's a real new field (say, one you've just invented), you'll discover
<br>
that surprising numbers of people have been down similiar pathways before,
<br>
and some of their stuff even works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; will notify you if that changes.  If you make further posts along these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines, I will consider it not friendly advice, but a snide attack on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation, and respond accordingly.
</em><br>
<p>Do what you want. I think I owe you some advice, because I had none when I
<br>
was your age. You need to listen to other people (of course being
<br>
selective about it) if you want to go places.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm serious about this, Eugene.  We've discussed this before, and you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been warned before.  I tolerated this when I was eighteen because it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been well-meant.  The plausibility of that hypothesis is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dwindling towards zero.  You've been one of my steadfast (albeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repetitive) critics where AI is concerned, and I nearly respect that, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't respect this.  I don't know why you would suddenly decide your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal in life is to trash my reputation, and it would be paranoid of me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attribute to malice what I can attribute to well-meant condescension, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be equally careless of me not to consider that I may be under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberate attack.  If you continue making these remarks, I will assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are entirely malicious in nature.
