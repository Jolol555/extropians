<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The failure to permit the laborer to keep and use the fruits of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; labor as he would any tool (used to generate a return on investment)
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; slavery, pure and simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Obviously--unless, of course, you believe otherwise. Why won't tools and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other means of production be held in common rather than as private
</em><br>
property
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the socialist's utopia? I think I am beginning to see why socialists
</em><br>
et.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; al evade your charge of an inherent contradiction. ;)

You're switching gears on me Michael. Your original position was that there
<br>
was an inherent contradiction in socialism, but now it seems that you are
<br>
saying (merely) that there is no good reason for socialism. Consider a
<br>
parallel: Christianity has been attacked for harbouring inherent
<br>
contradictions, e.g., the Aussi philosopher J. L. Mackie famously argued
<br>
that the existence of evil in conjunction with the traditional conception of
<br>
God forms an inconsistent set. (The concept of the Trinity has also
<br>
suggested to some that Christianity harbours a contradiction). Your original
<br>
charge of an inherent contradiction seemed like you were making this point
<br>
against socialism. But your present challenge concerning your computer looks
<br>
simply like you are saying socialism is false, or that there is no good
<br>
reason in favour of it. This would be like someone who concedes that
<br>
Christianity is a consistent position, but that as a matter of fact it is
<br>
false. One might suggest, for example, that the facts of evolution show that
<br>
there is no good reason to believe Christianity. The idea that there was a
<br>
contradiction in socialism looked interesting, to say simply that it is
<br>
false or that there is no good reason for it seems to cover well trodden
<br>
ground.
