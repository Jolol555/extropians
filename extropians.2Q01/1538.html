<p><em>&gt;I don't see you as such. As I stated the companies are seeking to

<p><p><em>&gt;There's the rub, Brian. What is in my interest may not be in the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;interest would be to have IT Guilds, which would effectively,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choke out competition, and drive inflation in a demand-push style.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My own little mafia. I also note that the importers of foreign IT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;folk are never subject to  'foreign' management teams, competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with them, on their own soil. That ultimately, might be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;satisfying, for me. Sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander. Ah
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well, consider it demented musings.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to call your union a guild, go ahead, after all unions
<br>
were originally patterned on them.
<br>
<p>It's funny how everyone tries to point at unions and yell
<br>
&quot;monopoly&quot; (single seller) and rarely point at the businesses that
<br>
spawn them and yell &quot;monopsony&quot; (single buyer) In fact unless I'm
<br>
spelling it wrong, my &quot;college&quot; dictionary doesn't even contain the
<br>
word!
<br>
<p>Most unions always face competition, from of course non-union
<br>
outfits, rarely is the monopoly ever complete. Professional sports
<br>
unions are the most complete examples I can think of.
<br>
<p>As to the long-term interest of your/mine countrymen, I know of no
<br>
such negative impact. Union pay raises are usually between the
<br>
inflation index and the general increase of a companies stock, and
<br>
95% of the time closer to the former.
<br>
<p>The stock market since inception averages 11% a year, no union
<br>
contract with the possible exception of the sports unions has ever
<br>
approached that.
<br>
<p>We have a large contingent of programmers from India here in my
<br>
building, from talks with individuals I know they make considerably
<br>
less than there american counterparts, but much more than &quot;back
<br>
home&quot;. When they originally came the programmers here were
<br>
sufficently upset that the company explained that they were only
<br>
here to do COBOL and provided some new training opportunities for
<br>
the existing people. This successfully ended an early attempt at
<br>
these people becoming organized.
<br>
<p>Guess what? There are more of them then ever, and they don't just
<br>
do COBOL anymore.....
<br>

<br>
<p>p.s. That's more of then now then ever....
