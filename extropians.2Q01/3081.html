<p>Ken MacLeod has said that the socialism of the Old Left was totally about
<br>
progress, and humanistic in the best sense, and not friendly toward
<br>
animal-rights ideas.  Whatever else one can say about Marxism it is a
<br>
_progressive_ theory, from savagery to feudalism to capitalism (Marx and
<br>
Engels gave one of the most eloquent praises of capitalism vs. feudalism, far
<br>
better than Ayn Rand, I think) to socialism to communism.  With technology as
<br>
the mediator, at least between feudalism and capitalism.  We may think that
<br>
socialism is not progress, or even possible, but the intent was definitely
<br>
progressive.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Left&quot; isn't.  The social-anarchist protagonist of _The Star Fraction_
<br>
starts out with a job shooting animal-rights and anti-computer activists.
<br>
(A job defending research labs, technically, in a more violent world than
<br>
today.)
<br>
<p>MacLeod also observed that socialists tend not to believe in AI, for no clear
<br>
reason; Iain Banks is the big exception.  (MacLeod isn't, despite writing four
<br>
excellent books with AI as a basic postulate.)  Smart computers seem more
<br>
popular in capitalist libertaria.
<br>
<p>But at any rate, I don't think a &quot;valid leftist system&quot; needs to be
<br>
constructed.  It's there.  It's just that Green &quot;leftists&quot; might be swamping
<br>
progressive &quot;leftists.&quot;
