I actually would want to see it, or a realistic summary.  For example, today I
<br>
went to the county records building.  There, they store various records that
<br>
are there for the public to review.  They store the recent data in computers,
<br>
from about 1996 onwards.  Everything else is in the books, the books are large
<br>
ledger books, with thousands of pages with with sixty or so lines per page,
<br>
with thousands of books.  So, if I had bought property in the county, the
<br>
record would be there for me to review.
<br>
<p>So, about the question to ask the FBI, ask, &quot;before this request, what are
<br>
your records with me?&quot;  And it would probably be empty.  If it wasn't, then
<br>
from that information I could learn much more about it why.  So, the same
<br>
question would go for similar agencies.
<br>
<p>I have suggested in the past that government agencies be required to abandon
<br>
interagency unique identifiers.  For example, the &quot;Taxpayer Identification
<br>
Number&quot;, &quot;TIN&quot;, or as it is more often known the &quot;Social Security Number&quot;, is
<br>
too widespread.  For example, some types of fraud play upon information
<br>
readily accessible from that, which is why banks and many private people
<br>
reserve that kind of personal information.
<br>
<p>Moreso than that, I want to see the money trail, where our taxes go, in
<br>
general enough terms.  It's easy, or not, to get the copies of the budgets
<br>
from the Government Printing Office, but the goal is to be able to audit the
<br>
government, to some extent, to ensure that they perform legally, effectively,
<br>
and with due diligence.
