<em>&gt; In Mind Children (which I stuck in my book bag, Sunday, which I took to
</em><br>
work)
<br>
<em>&gt; and Robot, conceivably, the Supplanters would have done the supplanting in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snap! Then they might generate an intermediary (advocate) to communicate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assist the newly, re-created Supplantees (versions 3,2,1) to get used to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new situation. According to Moravec, it would be absolutely, trivial, for
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; AI SI's to whip up a few dozen cyberworld's in which the oldster's could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'live' until they developed enough to ascend (a meritocracy). &quot;You people
</em><br>
get
<br>
<em>&gt; over it! It's already done! Now, how about this nice little Middle Earth
</em><br>
Sim,
<br>
<em>&gt; easy controls on the Sauron and Balrog bots?&quot;

<p>These scenarios satisfy both the extropic urge for transformation and the
<br>
non-extropian pining for preservation and conservation. I especially like the
<br>
insertion of meritocracy into this recipe for a cognitive banquet. Moravec
<br>
does not address the issue of suicide as it would relate to Great Brains,
<br>
perhaps because he (like many others) considers this a matter for the medical
<br>
professions, and not directly relevant to AI/SI. When reality becomes boring,
<br>
creative (and not really great) brains find refuge in fantasy and fiction.
<br>
Moravec and company have chosen to attempt to make real the fantasy of AI.
<br>
Nevertheless, great brains such as Nietzsche have managed to understand
<br>
Eternal Recurrence. ER means that it's all happened before, an infinite number
<br>
of times, in infinite variations. ER equates to Many Worlds times eternity.
<br>
<p>Once one understands ER, it becomes obvious that Great Brains would also
<br>
understand ER. Great Brains would therefore know better than to create
<br>
redundant simulations of reality, since the multiverse recreates itself
<br>
anyway. Everything that can happen has already happened, and not just once,
<br>
but an infinite number of times... and this goes on eternally. Knowing this,
<br>
suicide is neither an escape nor a tragedy.
<br>
<p>Life is plentiful, and intelligence is rare, because intelligence ultimately
<br>
reaches to the knowledge that life is meaningless and purposeless.
<br>
<p>Life means to find out, and having found it all out, life forebears further
<br>
entanglements. Then no greater brain need emerge, which explains why no
<br>
greater brain *has* emerged.
<br>
<p>Fermi's paradox is not a paradox at all. Explanation: Intelligence matures to
<br>
the point where it understands Eternal Recurrence, and then it discerns the
<br>
futility of further evolution. The crown of creation has figured out that
<br>
we're all going to the same place, namely, nowhere (now-here).

<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
