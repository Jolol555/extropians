</em><br>
<p>Sure but let me get more to the point:  send some kind of
<br>
advance warning to the parameds so they know what they
<br>
are facing.  Heres an extension of the idea:
<br>
<p>Over the next several years, the proletariat will begin to
<br>
warm to the notion of cryonics, at which time there will be
<br>
mountains of funds coming available to support businesses
<br>
that are designed to facilitate rescue of freezer geezers.
<br>
When we get a few thousand signers-up in an area of
<br>
say 20 km, I can imagine an emergency technician who
<br>
sits with a motorcycle standing by, idle most days,
<br>
perhaps with an electric device keeping the engine warm
<br>
around the clock.  Upon getting an emergency
<br>
call, this motorcycle automatically starts up.  Within 3 seconds,
<br>
the specially trained paramed has her GPS equipped helmet
<br>
on her head and has mounted the already warm bike and
<br>
is snapping it into gear, without yet actually knowing where
<br>
she is going, but the helmet-mounted speakers tell her which
<br>
way to turn.  On the bike is the essential equipment to
<br>
begin a cryosuspension.
<br>
<p>Those who drive State Road 237 in the south bay of
<br>
Taxifornia know exactly what I am talking about when
<br>
I say there are many cases when emergency vehicles
<br>
cannot make headway much faster than the rest of
<br>
the crawling traffic.  The road is clogged with head-
<br>
banging 20-something dot com CEOs, jamming
<br>
on their tunes in their humvees, and simply dont hear
<br>
the sirens.  And even if they do, they often *cannot* yield,
<br>
not because of selfishness, but because there is simply
<br>
no place to go.  We have seen this.  But a motorcycle with
<br>
a skilled rider could kite past the traffic in that meter-wide
<br>
space between the left lane traffic and the divider wall.
<br>
<p>Would not motor-medics be a wonderful career option
<br>
for the adredaline junky crowd?  To tear thru traffic with
<br>
gleeful abandon without fear of legal repercussion?  Could
<br>
we not save some patients who might otherwise perish,
<br>
such as the heart attack lady from Seattle?  Could we not
<br>
save many brain cells that would otherwise be lost?  spike
