<p><em>&gt; The official story is plausible.  Hoof and mouth is an RNA virus, has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high mutation rate, and tends to generate new epidemics rather like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influenza.
</em><br>
<p>I looked this up in Field's Virology (cool people always have
<br>
this double volume book on nasty parasites nearby...) and
<br>
Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus is a Aphthovirus with 7 serotypes.
<br>
It looks like the most closely related viruses are Rhinoviruses
<br>
(causing colds) and Enterovirues (that inhabit the alimentary tract).
<br>
The Enteroviruses include polioviruses.  The Genome appears to be ~8.5
<br>
kilobases with ~9 genes.  The genome reproduction strategy the virus
<br>
uses is essentially the same as poliovirus (they have an almost
<br>
identical gene pattern).
<br>
<p>As its a single-strand genome, it should not be compared with influenza
<br>
which is a multi-strand genome.  Influenza gets its variance through
<br>
recombination.  FMDV must get its variance through sloppy replication.
<br>
<p>I'd agree that the solution would appear to be vaccination.
<br>
Modern PCR based methods should be able to rapidly amplify
<br>
and detect the virus so the determination of an infection should
<br>
be simple.  Old anti-body based detection methods should give way
<br>
to direct detection of the genetic material.  I think Europe's
<br>
policies are outdated.
