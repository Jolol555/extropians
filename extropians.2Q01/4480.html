<p>I originally read this as &quot;*whisper* or band&quot;.  Naturally, I thought to
<br>
myself, &quot;Why not both?&quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&quot;Bang,&quot; whispered the eco-terrorist as he pressed the big red button on his
<br>
remote control.  Nothing happened.  He pressed it again.  Still nothing.  He
<br>
banged the device against the wall of his tiny blast cocoon.  Still, it
<br>
wouldn't work.
<br>
<p>He swore.  After raising millions of dollars from criminal activities and
<br>
years of planning the final destruction of the world's most advanced physics
<br>
research center, the detonator fails.  The idiots probably forgot the
<br>
batteries!  He swore and jabbed at the release mechanism for his pod.  He
<br>
would have to trigger the bombs manually.
<br>
<p>There was a strange hissing noise as the pod opened.  He felt nauseous and
<br>
dizzy all at once.  Was it gas?  Had the jackbooted scientists found him?
<br>
He tried to see through the opening of his pod through a migraine that was
<br>
stabbing through both eyes, deep into his brain, but he couldn't see
<br>
anything.  He couldn't tell if it was the darkness or pain that was blinding
<br>
him.
<br>
<p>When the pod door swung fully open, he realized that there was nothing
<br>
there.  No room, no horizon, nothing.  Through the melted outer portal, he
<br>
stared out into space.  The entire planet was gone.  He tried to scream, but
<br>
the atmosphere had completely drained from his compartment.  Only his final
<br>
realization echoed silently in his brain as his near-frozen corpse tumbled
<br>
slowly into the vacuum of space....
