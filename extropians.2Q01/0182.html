Last November, Max More informed this list of the on-line
<br>
article &quot;Ghost in the Machine: What Neuroscientists and
<br>
Computer Scientists Can Learn from Each Other&quot; at

<br>
<p>I replied to this with a description of and some excerpts from a book
<br>
I had just read, _Darwin Machines and the Nature of Knowledge_ by
<br>
Henry C. Plotkin, 1993, Harvard University Press (paperback
<br>
edition, 269 pages; see
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674192818/qid=974465462/sr=1-2/107-6292930-3771726">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674192818/qid=974465462/sr=1-2/107-6292930-3771726</a>
<br>
(&lt;4Q 2000&gt; isn't yet in the Extropians' archive, so unfortunately
<br>
I can't give a link to my review).  I concluded my post
<br>
with the remark:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since Plotkin mentions Gerald M. Edelman and Jean-Pierre
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Changeux in the same breath, I ordered a book by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter: _L'Homme Neuronal_ (Fayard, 1983).  I have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before attempted to read a serious book in French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (never having gotten much beyond _Le Petit Prince_, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a long time ago), so I may have bitten off more than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can chew.  Nevertheless, I still get a thrill from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to use the Web for international shopping -- I ordered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the book from a Paris on-line bookstore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.chapitre.com">http://www.chapitre.com</a>
</em><br>
<p>Since I've finished this book I thought I'd mention it
<br>
briefly.  Fortunately, I didn't have to struggle through
<br>
it in French; there's an English translation in the
<br>
Princeton Science Library entitled _Neuronal Man: The
<br>
Biology of Mind_ (Princeton University Press, 1997), see
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691026661/qid=983820830/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/102-1083400-8739317">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691026661/qid=983820830/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_1/102-1083400-8739317</a>
<br>
I don't know how I managed to miss the existence of the
<br>
translation the first time around; I saw it and bought it
<br>
at a local Barnes &amp; Noble, and then the French copy I had
<br>
ordered too hastily on-line turned out to have been sold,
<br>
so I was lucky.
<br>
<p>The book is a good introduction to neuroscience for a
<br>
layman (like me), with a heavy emphasis on the history
<br>
of the field and with a more detailed look at neuranatomy
<br>
than Edelman (for example) provides.  If Changeux is less
<br>
inspiring than Edelman -- he offers no pretense of
<br>
constructing the scaffolding for a theory of consciousness --
<br>
he's also less susceptible than Edelman to the accusation
<br>
of indulging in speculative neuroscience.  One is
<br>
conscious that this is a translation; one can sense the
<br>
creaking of strained idioms from time to time.
<br>
<p>Here are a couple of representative passages.  From Chapter 2
<br>
&quot;The Component Parts of the Brain&quot;, section heading &quot;From Mouse
<br>
To Man&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;No category of cell, no particular type of circuit is
<br>
specific to the human cerebral cortex.  The components of our
<br>
cerebral machinery derive from a stock very similar, if not
<br>
identical, to that of the mouse.  The major event in the
<br>
evolution of the mammalian brain, as we have seen, is the
<br>
expansion of the neocortex...  The number of cellular
<br>
elements per unit of surface area has not changed...  On
<br>
average, the cortex of man is only three times thicker than
<br>
that of the mouse...  The more the surface area of the
<br>
cortex expands, the more the number of neurons capable of
<br>
establishing association connections increases; the area of
<br>
the association cortex thus becomes relatively greater than
<br>
that of primary sensory and motor areas.  This translates,
<br>
finally, into an increase in the mean number of connections
<br>
per neuron...  Nevertheless, the increase in the mean number
<br>
of synapses per neuron is not directly proportional to the
<br>
increase in cortical area.  Far from it.  The density of
<br>
synapses per cubic millimeter of cortex is of the same order
<br>
in the rat as in man.  Because the thickness of the cortex
<br>
increases only a maximum of three times, the mean number of
<br>
synapses per neuron in man can hardly exceed three times that
<br>
of the rat, whereas the area of the cortex is four hundred
<br>
times greater.  The increase in the mean number of synaptic
<br>
contacts is thus not enough to explain entirely the increase
<br>
in complexity of the cerebral cortex in the course of
<br>
mammalian evolution.  Other parameters intervene, such as the
<br>
diversification of cortical areas...
<br>
<p>At the level of both the macroscopic anatomy of the cortex
<br>
and its microscopic architecture, no sudden qualitative
<br>
reorganization marks the passage from the &quot;animal&quot; brain to
<br>
the human brain.  There is, on the contrary, a continuous
<br>
**quantitative** evolution in the total number of neurons,
<br>
the diversity of areas, the number of possible connections
<br>
between neurons, and, therefore, the complexity of the
<br>
neuronal networks that make up the cerebral machine.&quot;
<br>
<p>And from Chapter 9, &quot;The Brain -- Representation of the
<br>
World&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;A mental object is by definition a transient event.  It is
<br>
dynamic and fleeting, lasting only fractions of a second.
<br>
The [functional characteristics] of the neurons that form
<br>
it, however, are much more stable; they are built up during
<br>
development by mechanisms involving internal genetic
<br>
expressions and regulations stemming from a chain of
<br>
reciprocal interaction with the environment...  This imprint
<br>
of the physical and sociocultural world remains stable
<br>
for many years, even throughout the life of an individual...
<br>
The major features of the organization of the brain, which
<br>
ensure the unity of humankind and are subject to genetic
<br>
constraint, also constitute a representation of the world,
<br>
built up over generations by the evolution of the genome
<br>
of our fossil ancestors.
<br>
<p>Consequently, the human brain contains, or produces, at
<br>
least three major categories of representations of the world.
<br>
The kinetics of the formation of these representations
<br>
and their stability encompass time scales ranging from
<br>
tenths of a second to hundreds of millions of years.  Each of
<br>
these modes of representation widens the horizon of the world
<br>
represented.  The &quot;rigidity&quot; of a brain determined entirely
<br>
genetically would, from the very beginning, impose a limit
<br>
on the numbers of possible operations.  The capability of
<br>
constructing labile representations opens the organization of
<br>
the brain to the social and cultural environment.  These
<br>
&quot;new worlds&quot; can evolve on their own -- limited, however, by
<br>
rules that are determined by the overall performance of the
<br>
cerebral organization.
<br>
<p>If the hypotheses put forward [in this book] are correct,
<br>
the formation of each of these representations, although using
<br>
different elements and different levels of organization, obeys
<br>
a common rule, inspired by Darwin's original hypothesis.  A
<br>
process of selective stabilization takes over from diversification
<br>
by variation.  The mechanisms associated with evolution of the
<br>
genome[,]... [c]hromosomal reorganization, duplication of genes,
<br>
recombinations and mutations, all create genetic diversity, but
<br>
only a few of the multiple combinations that appear in each
<br>
generation are maintained in natural populations.  During
<br>
postnatal epigenesis, the &quot;transient redundancy&quot; of cells
<br>
and connections and the way in which they grow produce a
<br>
diversity not restricted to one dimension like the genome,
<br>
but existing in the three dimensions of space.  Here again,
<br>
only a few of the geometric configurations that appear during
<br>
development are stabilized in the adult...  Does such a
<br>
model apply for the more &quot;creative&quot; aspects of our thought
<br>
processes?  Is it also valid for the acquisition of knowledge?
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>It is... worth noting that in the history of ideas &quot;directive&quot;
<br>
hypotheses have most often preceded selective hypotheses.
<br>
When Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck tried to found his theory of
<br>
&quot;descendance&quot; on a plausible biological mechanism, he proposed
<br>
the &quot;heredity of acquired characteristics&quot;, a tenet that
<br>
advances in genetics would eventually destroy.  One had to
<br>
wait almost half a century before the idea of selection was
<br>
proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace and validated
<br>
in principle, if not in all the details of its application.
<br>
In the same way the first theories about the production of
<br>
antibodies were originally based on directive models before
<br>
selective mechanisms replaced them.  It could conceivably be
<br>
the same for theories of learning.&quot;
