<p>Yes, and when are we going to get to see you being interviewed
<br>
by John C. Dvorak or Michaela Pereira on TechTV's &quot;Big Thinkers&quot;? ;-&gt;
<br>
They've already had Gibson and Sterling and Kurzweil, and Dvorak's even
<br>
had Vinge on the Singularity, so you wouldn't have to explain to **him**
<br>
what the word means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A lot of post-Singularity still-human individuals ran it, more so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Eliezer is one of the few (historical) personalities that can be run in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a totally immersive, non-knowing simulation without violating citizenship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights... though it does have a certain effect on your personality...
</em><br>
<p>Now that's an interesting parallel to Olaf Stapledon, whose Last
<br>
Men project their minds into the past to give comfort and
<br>
enlightenment to earlier races.  You're going to be the Power who provides
<br>
his ancestral simulation as an avatar to the hesitating fleshers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can watch the 24-hour Buffy channel; you can live in an immersive

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No thanks, but I'll certainly be spending a subjective millennium
<br>
or two in Lothlorien.
<br>
<p>&quot;'There lie the woods of Lothlorien!' said Legolas.  'That is
<br>
the fairest of all the dwellings of my people.  There are no trees
<br>
like the trees of that land.  For in the autumn their leaves fall
<br>
not, but turn to gold.  Not till the spring comes and the new
<br>
green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow
<br>
flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the
<br>
roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is
<br>
smooth and grey.  So still our songs in Mirkwood say.  My heart
<br>
would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it
<br>
were springtime!'&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer Yudkowsky is one of the few historical personalities who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be willing to... exist and hurt and be effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annihilated at the end
</em><br>
<p>Um, speaking of Olaf Stapledon, you **have** read _Odd John_,
<br>
haven't you?
<br>
<p>&quot;When I told John that I intended to write his biography, he
<br>
laughed.  'My dear **man**!' he said, 'But of course, it was
<br>
inevitable.'  The word 'man' on John's lips was often equivalent
<br>
to 'fool.'
<br>
<p>'Well', I protested, 'a cat may look at a king.'
<br>
<p>He replied, 'Yes, but can it really **see** the king?  Can you,
<br>
puss, really see me?'
<br>
<p>This from a queer child to a full-grown man.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cheers.
