</em><br>
<p>Thanks!  And yup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;sound like the sort of thing a maturing AI would formulate to learn

</em><br>
<p>But I *am* a maturing AI.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are there any moderately technical works you would care to recommend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the subject?
</em><br>
<p>As you might guess, I'm not as familiar with these things as a professional
<br>
philosopher would be.  If by &quot;technical&quot; you mean math &amp; formalism, I
<br>
doubt there are any.  If you mean the professionals going into more detail,
<br>
I cited the more detailed works I know of.   Some are on JSTOR I think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Such moral intuitions are commonly considered to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially likely to be in error, all else equal, through some complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process of self-deception.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...  A slave-owner who believes that slaves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cannot be trusted with freedom is not deceiving himself; he is rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being deceived by evolution - he is making cognitive errors which have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adaptive value (for him).
</em><br>
<p>I don't really care which words we use to describe these concepts; I
<br>
mainly care that we can communicate and that we make useful distinctions.
<br>
The phrase &quot;self-deception&quot; now has several connotations, and I think my
<br>
usage is within the usual range, but I agree it would be nice to make
<br>
more distinctions.
<br>
<p>The slave owner is deceiving himself if in some sense &quot;he should know
<br>
better.&quot;  That is, if he has cognitive tools to uncover the gene
<br>
deception but seems especially reluctant to use them.  I want to learn
<br>
a lot more about self-deception - especially warning signs regarding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This presumes that the female of the species is seeking health, wealth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and intelligence as declarative goals, rather than responding to cues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which were adaptive cues in the ancestral environment;
</em><br>
<p>Yes - that is my point - we can't substitute other signals because the
<br>
choice of the existing ones is hard-coded in some ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Health care is not just a signal for loyalty because of its sparse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporal distribution, but because of its context-insensitivity.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sends a signal to nearby observers that the carer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is someone who can be relied on to remain allied even under extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I had this in mind when I said &quot;hard times&quot;, but I could be clearer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;unconditional ally is substantially more valuable than a conditional ally;
</em><br>
<p>Well its a bit more complicated - we want it to be conditional on some
<br>
things and unconditional on others.   We expect and want feelings to be
<br>
conditional on betrayal, for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;If we think of status as having many good allies, then you want them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;act as if they were sure to be of high status.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why?
</em><br>
<p>That follows from the few sentences before it.  You might prefer my
<br>
longer presentation, with math, in <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But the main thing I'm objecting to is that you went *way* too fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in that paragraph and totally lost me.
</em><br>
<p>Gotcha.  Will try to expand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Health makes someone a more valuable ally.  Happiness may or may not.
</em><br>
<p>As stated, this isn't clear to me.  &quot;happiness&quot; is presumably just a proxy
<br>
for other more fundamental things one can invest in.  It is not clear that
<br>
health is more useful to allies than the typical other things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It looks to me like it's just standard paternalism, ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I see no domain specificity for health care;
</em><br>
<p>But empirically we so much more paternalism in health areas than in other
<br>
policy areas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... as far as I can tell, advocacy of NHI is generated by the same set
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of causes that generate advocacy of Welfare.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To be specific, both Welfare and NHI derive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argumentary force from our intuitions about how to treat tribal members
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who are the victims of unpredictable, major, temporally sparse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;catastrophes.
</em><br>
<p>The urge to nationalize is much stronger in health care than in most
<br>
industries.  Your alternative explanation is not that far from mine.
<br>
<p>Thanks for taking me seriously enough to read and react!
