I think this points to what I like to think of as the diffraction or
<br>
spread of humanity during the singularity...
<br>
<p>As the stress and impact of technology pulls the fabric of society
<br>
apart, you begin to see the diffraction of the various levels of
<br>
humanity in the context of technological impact... This is analagous
<br>
to the impact of tidal force pulling something apart as it enters a
<br>
black hole... and eventually it get's ripped into a stream of strings...
<br>
<p>So the scientist augments first, then the business man, then the
<br>
American dirt farmer, then the Nirobi slum dweller, and finally the
<br>
Tibetan goat herder... As the impact of the technology amplifies
<br>
the difference, the breadth of the gap between haves and have
<br>
nots... the span between those who enter the event horizon of
<br>
the singularity first and last will expand exponentially.
<br>
<p>I see our predictions as neither optimistic or pessimistic... I see
<br>
them as pure fantasy. We are over the event horizon of the future
<br>
that was predictable from 1970. 10 years ahead from now is just
<br>
as far from our perspective of evolution as 30 years back was. In
<br>
fact it may be more like 50 years back. 10 years from now we'll
<br>
be working with technology that so dwarfs what we currently
<br>
use, that it makes almost no sense to try to guess. IBM is selling
<br>
fairy dust today... Japan will sell crystal storage tomorrow... the
<br>
HAL box will begin to bring meaningful AI capable hardware to
<br>
your desk top next year... A company in Chicago has built and is
<br>
marketing a holographic molecular manipulator... self assembling
<br>
MEMs are slated for imminent production.
<br>
<p>Folks... smell the coffee... this is all stuff that is happening NOW!
<br>
Genomics is here. The protein analysis of the human genome is
<br>
slated to take 3 years. This is stuff that 10 years ago people were
<br>
predicting would take 50 years. The time for picking your seat on
<br>
the bus is getting SHORT. Of course those of you who are now
<br>
reading this are probably in the right place. The only question that
<br>
matters is what responsibility do we have to the rest of our species
<br>
and how are we going to get them all lined up for what's coming?
<br>
<p>First rule of singularities... is you can't predict what will happen...
<br>
The FM component just get's to great... (FM = Friggin Magic).
<br>
<p>The only thing that makes sense is bringing as much sanity to the
<br>
conversation as possible (which inherently means checking egos
<br>
at the door, and letting go of survival behavior.) AND doing what
<br>
ever it takes to persuade the world cultures in embracing the great
<br>
possibility of their own evolution.
