Here's an article from a green forum that expresses well in one essay much of 
<br>
the world-view of greens and anti-tech folks.  All of the thinking here is 
<br>
premised on straight-line projections of current technologies and a deep 
<br>
antipathy to private enterprise.

<p>What will our children inherit?
<br>
<p>By Liz Elliott
<br>
<p>For most tribal and village people, for most of human history, the
<br>
cosmos felt to be a place of belonging and security, with significant
<br>
connections to  nature and community . Land was communally owned and
<br>
cared for. In modern suburban, mobile culture we become cut off from
<br>
the land and our neighbours, and thus suffer anxiety. To sedate this
<br>
emptiness, the richest 20% of humans consume 80% of the world's
<br>
resources, vast amounts of stuff, polluting air and water and
<br>
destroying soil fertility. Consumerism and the religion of economic
<br>
growth distract us from the purpose of human life; softening the
<br>
underlying transfer of interest/debt money, power and resources to the
<br>
top 1%, blinding us to the great impoverishment of environment,
<br>
community and Third World enslavement. &quot;Consume more!&quot; urge the
<br>
corporations, which spend more on advertising than the world spends on
<br>
education.
<br>
<p>However  it cannot go on. If we all lived like Americans we would need
<br>
three planets. And we are heading for 11 billion population in 100
<br>
years The maths of environmental destruction to pay debt shows this
<br>
excessive consumption cannot go on; it is a compounding interest
<br>
situation where 3% growth a year means 7 times the production in 60
<br>
years.  The CSIRO estimates we Australians must decrease their
<br>
resource use by 90% in 100 years! .  How will we do this? Since 50%
<br>
plus of prices=effort=environmental use are to pay interest, i.e. make
<br>
the richest 5% richer,  much resource use could be reduced by bank
<br>
restructuring. Taxes and waste could be markedly reduced. Economic
<br>
growth must be reduced by 2% a year, particularly with fossil
<br>
fuel/greenhouse emissions, and replaced with growth in ecology,
<br>
community, art/music, family, health  and sprituality. Not necessarily
<br>
a decline in true standard of living! In fact, a great opportunity!!
<br>
<p>The current &quot;Economic Growth in GDP&quot; goal is based on false accounting
<br>
(destroying our natural capital and calling this growth!),
<br>
commercialising the huge unpaid love economy, on exporting our soil,
<br>
water and work and beggaring-our-neighbours and on failing to pay the
<br>
true cost of our consumption rampage. Our children will have to pay.
<br>
And the cleanup will be much more expensive than the costs &quot;saved&quot; in
<br>
the short run. We are wasting a precious opportunity to invest in
<br>
sustainable technology, so that our children can live off the interest
<br>
(for instance using petrol for solar cells manufacture). Actually, our
<br>
true standard of living taking into account environmental loss, crime
<br>
and others stresses, has been dropping since 1975.
<br>
<p>The Free market/ economic irrationalist ideology is based on a
<br>
perversion of Adams Smiths ideas; Smith never envisioned producers not
<br>
paying their true costs of production, nor of capital being
<br>
internationally hypermobile. Since profits in the unreal financial
<br>
economy, derivatives, shares, merger driven profits etc have been 20%
<br>
plus,  investments in the real world of food, transport and housing
<br>
must perform to the same unsustainable  profit return if they are to
<br>
attract scarce capital. Such high profits are only possible by not
<br>
paying tax, stressing workers and gouging the Earth.
<br>
<p>Elders everywhere tell the same story; their land does not look as
<br>
lush or healthy as it used to. Gone are the great cod fisheries of
<br>
eastern Atlantic, the Amazon  goes in 25 years, and oil will start
<br>
running out in 20 years. Humans already use 50% of world fresh water
<br>
and arable soils. Minerals and petrol we extract will in future be
<br>
from  more marginal, harder to access sources. A quarter of a million
<br>
acres of forest are lost a day. Trees are nature's water pumps, rain
<br>
makers and nurseries. At the current rate of soil loss through
<br>
desertification, salination and erosion, there will be no arable soils
<br>
within 100 years. Agribusiness mines soils till they are just root
<br>
holders to pour chemicals into. 12 kilos of soil are lost for every
<br>
kilo of food produced. Globalized corporations scour the world for the
<br>
cheapest raw materials, lowest environmental standards and worst
<br>
working conditions for workers, small business and farmers.
<br>
<p>The feedlot dairy industry is a classic agribusiness disaster, cruel
<br>
to cows, polluting to rivers, wasteful! And capital intensive so
<br>
farmers are progressively turned into bank serfs. In the US, chicken
<br>
and hog farmers are dictated to every step by giant vertically
<br>
integrated feed, fertilizer and storage companies like Cargill. Until
<br>
there is a price squeeze or climate problem, when the farmers take the
<br>
risk and their holdings are resumed by the banks, also owned by
<br>
Cargill, ArcherDanielMidland  and Aventis. Everywhere farmers' margins
<br>
are reduced, whilst supermarkets and transport/fuel corporations make
<br>
higher percentages. Chemical intensive/ petrol using farming and
<br>
transporting sends farmers broke! International and continent wide
<br>
transport of basics is unnecessary and polluting, yet supermarket
<br>
style food chains are seen as cheaper. &quot;Cheap&quot; at the expense of
<br>
farmers, environment and climate. Our climate is becoming more
<br>
unstable due to Big Oil protecting its investment in anachronistic
<br>
technology. Our seas and waterways are used as a toxic dump; 13
<br>
million tons of chemicals go into our environment every day. Chemicals
<br>
are not recyclable, biomagnify and are totally unknown in their long
<br>
term effect. 1000 new chemicals a year enter the US market, only 25
<br>
tested, never in the long term, on sensitive people or in combination.
<br>
<p>Human physical health is threatened by agribusiness style farming; by
<br>
these chemicals, genetic engineering and proliferation of new
<br>
diseases. The shallow mineral and essential oil content of speed
<br>
grown, longhauled supermarket supplied food system predispose to heart
<br>
disease, cancer and depression, typical western diseases. These are
<br>
exaggerated by worker stress and loneliness of the marginalized
<br>
unemployed, old and young. Poorer nations' people suffer from simple
<br>
infections and stress, due to spending more on debt repayments than
<br>
Health, Education or Water.
<br>
<p>In the Two Thirds World, efficient peasant farmers are threatened by
<br>
monoculture farming for export. Small scale farms are much more
<br>
efficient than industrialised farming in terms of energy in/energy out
<br>
and total yield per acre. Small farmers are undermined by dumping of
<br>
subsidised foods produced by unsustainable methods, and by excessive
<br>
regulations favouring agribusiness, genetically engineered seed
<br>
oligopolies and irrigation/big dams. Colonialism with greater
<br>
environmental degradation! Once stable selfsufficient communities
<br>
disintegrate. Rural to city migrations create sweatshops which
<br>
undermine all workers' conditions and cause illegal emigration and
<br>
wars. Water and resource disputes precede much &quot;ethnic conflict&quot;; GATS
<br>
and other WTO treaties specify water as a tradeable commodity, with no
<br>
local protectionism being possible. GATS calls the environment &quot;a
<br>
service&quot;, to be privately administered.
<br>
<p>Unsustainable  policies are promoted by Big Business. Big farms get
<br>
most subsidies and infrastructure benefits. The  major parties are
<br>
bought out and offer no alternative to ecological collapse. Yet, in
<br>
all this accelerating destruction there is hope!
<br>
<p>50% of the world  still lives in more traditional systems where
<br>
democracy and sustainable agriculture are easily possible. With
<br>
minimal investment in low interest banking, small tools and
<br>
permaculture type training, many of these communities could be self
<br>
sufficient again. If not propped up by First World aid, oppressive
<br>
corrupt regimes could be toppled by third world people and much
<br>
forest, water and mineral wealth be better managed. 10 million South
<br>
Indian farmers have pledged to  defend their land against genetic
<br>
engineering. Huge demonstrations in Aisa, South America and India
<br>
against corporate slave labour conditions rarely get  press.
<br>
<p>Slowly, our churches are beginning to oppose immoral IMF bank
<br>
policies, and this last two years our intelligentsia are starting to
<br>
debate the failure of 30 years of Washington nonsensus policies.
<br>
Australian farmers are beginning to talk sustainability and group
<br>
together to protect their local water basins. Many young people, as
<br>
evidenced by S 11 and Seattle, have moved beyond &quot;light green&quot;
<br>
awareness, saving forests and beaches, and are becoming &quot;dark green&quot;;
<br>
looking at banking, money markets and trade policies  that drive
<br>
ecological gouging. The internet has spawned a huge educational
<br>
counter to shallow commercial media and education. In Europe, the
<br>
ATTAC group is spreading the word about green taxes; taxing resource
<br>
use, not labour, and the Tobin tax and Flat tax.
<br>
<p>The true nature of pharmaceutical=chemical=fertiizer=petroleum
<br>
corporations is becoming obvious.   Australians, long bought off by
<br>
privatisation of their assets, ecological rape and third world slave
<br>
labour cheapies, are waking up. The recent elections shows distrust of
<br>
the neoliberals' spindoctors and centralized power brokers.  The Green
<br>
vote has not been analysed by the press because its implications are
<br>
far more unsettling than Hanson's dress sense
<br>
<p>Vegetarianism and antigenetic engineering activism is spreading across
<br>
Europe. 20% yearly growth in organic farming and food demand in Europe
<br>
is fanned by concerns about disease and chemical toxicity. European
<br>
farmers are turning their farms and their bank balances around within
<br>
3-5 years of going organic!! Farmers' margins improve if less inputs
<br>
and less transport are needed. Getting off the debt treadmill requires
<br>
courage, but can be done in stages. BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY in crops and
<br>
complex permaculture style intercropping is strength in times of
<br>
climate change and monoculture crop disease.
<br>
<p>LOCALISATION; the restoring of local food supplies and small business
<br>
is underway in many aware areas, restoring jobs, social connection,
<br>
fresher, more nutritious foods and pride in ethical business. In
<br>
particular, the longhauling of foods can be reduced, cutting down much
<br>
pollution and Big Oil stranglehold on politics.
<br>
<p>Opposition to the impending G.A.T.S. treaty, privatising all services,
<br>
looks set to be the biggest struggle of the decade, albeit being
<br>
introduced by stealth. Slowly, people are seeing that globalization is
<br>
not inevitable, not sustainable and that big business must be
<br>
regulated. The rats cannot continue to run the ship. Globalisation is
<br>
opposed to nature, culture and our children's future.
