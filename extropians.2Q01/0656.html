<em>&gt; The entities running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our simulation do so not merely for entertainment but, more importantly, for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduction.  As they quite naturally exist themselves in computational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space, they generate new entities via computational means.  And just as we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate our children by the same means that our parents begat us, so too the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god (or gods) hosting our simulation rely on the rough-and-tumble of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interested agents (albeit simulated ones) to give birth to new gods.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our simulation thus functions something like a petri dish, and we sperm and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eggs striving to transcend it.
</em><br>
<p>I forget the biological term for this kind of reproductive strategy.
<br>
Some animals have lots of babies and only a few survive.  Think of frog
<br>
eggs spawning hundreds of tadpoles, most of whom are destined to fail.
<br>
Inevitably this strategy is associated with an absent or uncaring parent.
<br>
Mammals on the other hand have only a few babies and invest tremendous
<br>
effort and care in raising and nurturing them so that they have a good
<br>
chance of survival.
<br>
<p>Tom's gods seem to have reverted to the frog strategy.  It seems callous
<br>
by our standards to take your children and drop them into a Darwinian
<br>
sink or swim competition, in order to see which survive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One practicing the reliberion I'm describing would thus take as his or her 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal growing into and thus joining the god(s) hosting the simulation we, ex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesi, now live in.  Note that this by no means ratifies prayer, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-abasement, or other such humbug.  Nor does it necessarily imply outright 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejection of all rituals.  One would test such practices for their efficacy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in promoting the goal of achieving godhood.  (As a side benefit, it bears 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noting, such a reliberion, even if at best harmless, might help to block 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infection by more virulent strains of theology.)
</em><br>
<p>The idea that we should not ask for help and raise ourselves by our own
<br>
bootstraps is appealing in some ways, but isn't the only possible strategy
<br>
in life.  One might consider it as an essentially masculine approach,
<br>
contrasted with the feminine strategy of forging close relationships
<br>
and relying on others for assistance when it is needed.  The masculine
<br>
approach reaches its zenith in the stereotype of the male who refuses
<br>
to ask for directions when he is lost.
<br>
<p>Is it really so bad to ask for help?  Independence and competence
<br>
are virtues, yes, but being able to recognize and admit weakness and
<br>
incompetence can be just as important.  From this perspective, prayer
<br>
is an appeal for help from a weak individual to one who is far stronger
<br>
and more powerful.  Our masculine aspects scorn such weakness, while
<br>
our feminine aspects want to extend succor and aid.  (&quot;Succor&quot; reminds
<br>
me of &quot;suck&quot;, as when a female nurses a baby, but apparently there is
<br>
no etymological connection.)
<br>
<p>One other problem I have with this religion is that its prescriptions are
<br>
essentially the same as what we would do if it were false.  If there is
<br>
no simulation and no god, the best we can do is to strive to improve
<br>
ourselves.  If that is the same thing we are supposed to do in the
<br>
simulation, then the religion has no actual prescriptive content.
<br>
