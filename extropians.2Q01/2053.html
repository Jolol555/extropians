<em>&gt;Mark Plus:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An Indian economist (I believe he's named Amarya Sen) argues that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; democracies tend to become famine-resistant.  When things get too bad in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some region in a democratic country, the afflicted people complain to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; politicians.  Because these politicians want to get re-elected, they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incentives to _do something_ to alleviate the food shortages.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant that the greatest famines in the 20th Century occurred under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; authoritarian or totalitarian regimes, while in more-or-less democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; India, the food situation seems to be improving, along with general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; economic conditions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think it is democracy itself, but rather open societies with free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;markets that become immune. After all, if it was just a question of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government doing something, then one would expect feudal societies to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immune too.
</em><br>
<p><p>In Amartya Sen's own words (from 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.sintercom.org/polinfo/polessays/sen.html">http://www.sintercom.org/polinfo/polessays/sen.html</a>&gt;}:
<br>
<p>&quot;The governmental response to acute suffering often depends on the pressure 
<br>
that is put on it, and this is where the exercise of political rights 
<br>
(voting, criticizing, protesting, and so on) can make a real difference. I 
<br>
have discussed (in these pages and in my book Resources, Values, and 
<br>
Development) the remarkable fact that, in the terrible history of famines in 
<br>
the world, no substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent and 
<br>
democratic country with a relatively free press. Whether we look at famines 
<br>
in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, or other dictatorial regimes, or in the Soviet 
<br>
Union in the 1930s, or in China from 1958 to 1961 (at the failure of the 
<br>
Great Leap Forward, when between 23 and 30 million people died), or 
<br>
currently in North Korea, we do not find exceptions to this rule. (It is 
<br>
true that Ireland was part of democratic Britain during its famine of the 
<br>
1840s, but the extent of London's political dominance over the Irish was so 
<br>
strong--and the social distance so great and so old, as illustrated by 
<br>
Spenser's severely unfriendly description of the Irish in the sixteenth 
<br>
century--that the English rule over Ireland was, for all practical purposes, 
<br>
a colonial rule.)
<br>
<p>&quot;While this connection is clearest in the case of famine prevention, the 
<br>
positive role of political and civil rights applies to the prevention of 
<br>
economic and social disasters generally. When things go fine and everything 
<br>
is routinely good, this consequence of democracy may not be sorely missed. 
<br>
But it comes into its own when things get fouled up, for one reason or 
<br>
another. Then the political incentives provided by democratic governance 
<br>
acquire great practical value. To concentrate only on economic incentives 
<br>
(which the market system provides) while ignoring political incentives 
<br>
(which democratic systems provide) is to opt for a deeply unbalanced set of 
<br>
ground rules.&quot;
<br>
<p>I might add that Sen has one more Nobel Prize in Economics (1998) than we 
<br>
do.
<br>
