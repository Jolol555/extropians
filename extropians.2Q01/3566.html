<p>I think I read the some of the People stories much later.  It seems that
<br>
my
<br>
childhood was before most of these authors were old enough to write. :&lt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sigh. It was evidence. After all, those other people *must have had the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I remember when I first learned the word &quot;omniscient&quot;.  I thought that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How are you doing so far?
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, back in the 70s I thought I could get computers to do most of the
<br>
heavy lifting 
<br>
so I went out to learn computerese.  I was shocked that there were no
<br>
applications
<br>
remotely capable so I became a programmer.  Then I was shocked there
<br>
were no languages
<br>
sufficient so I got into computer languages.  Then there were no
<br>
database systems capable
<br>
and or friendly enough so I got into database systems, program
<br>
environments and so on.
<br>
Eventually I was getting pretty lost in the bits.  Finally I began to
<br>
see some light at
<br>
the end of the tunnel with the possibility of exponentially increasing
<br>
computer hardware
<br>
power, self-writing or self-improving  programs and linking with the
<br>
machines or pulling 
<br>
them within or joining them.  I'm still hacking at it.  Ask me in
<br>
another decade or so. :)
