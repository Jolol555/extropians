<em>&gt; Duncan Campbell talks to John Zerzan.
</em><br>
<p>I liked this paragraph...
<br>
<p>&quot;But is it not the case that much of the protest movement now is fuelled by
<br>
communication on the internet in a way that would otherwise be impossible?
<br>
&quot;That's another of the contradictions. It is true, for example, that many
<br>
more people have read my stuff [on the internet] than have bought the books,
<br>
and that's fine ... Many people I know do use it for instant communication,
<br>
for coordinating things. You can get anarchist news daily in 12 languages on
<br>
what is going on today in Greece or wherever and that is an obvious service.
<br>
I don't even have a computer, but I think you can use it without succumbing
<br>
to it.&quot; He does have a television set, and contributes to the underground
<br>
Radio Free Cascadia and cable access shows. &quot;Everyone needs to veg out at
<br>
times and television's not as bad as hard drugs.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm dodgy about the last point about TV :-) .
<br>
<p>If these guys win the day, and take us into neo-luddism, it's going to be
<br>
extraordinarily ironic. It seems that all the anti-tech movements, along
<br>
with the rest of the fringe interest groups out there (eg: us) are entirely
<br>
enabled by modern communications technology, specifically the internet (ok,
<br>
it's '70s communications technology, but let's not be picky).
<br>
<p>I wonder if any of the anarchist groups are blowing up their local internet
<br>
backbone infrastructure?
<br>
<p>Take this too... &quot;As one would expect there is no car outside Zerzan's
<br>
home - he cycles. &quot;
<br>
<p>I fail to see the qualitative distinction between a car and a bicycle, in
<br>
technological terms. Ot between the internet and books! Books, the most
<br>
direct, in your face product of the Gutenberg printing press, and symbolic
<br>
of the massive technological revolution which it enabled. Astounding.
<br>
<p>This &quot;back to nature&quot; stuff really pushes my buttons. We are already in
<br>
nature... we are utterly immersed in the natural right now. Humans and
<br>
technology are one; without our tools, we lose our primary distinction, that
<br>
which makes and defines us as human beings. To reject our tools is to reject
<br>
our essential nature.
<br>
<p>&quot;Natural&quot; is implicitly or explicitly defined by anti-tech people as
<br>
&quot;everything except humans and the stuff we make&quot;. It's such a hopeless point
<br>
of view, because it puts us outside of the rest of the universe, and defines
<br>
us as bad, while everything else is good.
<br>
<p>I can't see how we can be anything other than natural, given that we have
<br>
emerged from the chaotic flux of the universe, the same as everything else.
<br>
The operation of our intelligence, and the products of that, are all born of
<br>
these same processes. In this light, natural ceases to have a useful meaning
<br>
at all, because it just means &quot;everything&quot;.
<br>
<p>Another possible interpretation is that &quot;Natural&quot; is everything that has
<br>
come about through &quot;natural selection&quot;, the ebb and flow of the universe.
<br>
The only things outside of that are anything which is a product of
<br>
intelligent design, or intervention by intelligent beings. That keeps us
<br>
inside the definition of natural, but puts our tools out
<br>
<p>Or does it? How many here would be alive without current technology? I
<br>
possibly might be, but my wife and children would not (both kids were
<br>
emergency cesareans). I posit that a great many people would be in that
<br>
position. Further, even the constantly healthy amongst us live on a planet
<br>
of 6 billion people!
<br>
<p>Take the tech, and you kill most of us. All of us are now entirely dependant
<br>
on human technology to survive, whether we acknowledge it or not. It's just
<br>
that the life-support system is so transparent, at least to us in the west,
<br>
that many of us forget it is even in existence.
<br>
<p>Confronted with this truth, many retreat into Malthusian rhetoric, implying
<br>
that we are overpopulated, and that our population needs to get back to
<br>
&quot;acceptable&quot; levels. I get the impression that people who talk about
<br>
population in that way, mean some other population, far away from them. Pick
<br>
9 from each 10 of your friends, family, loved ones. That's what it really
<br>
means.
<br>
<p>I think we need to get to acceptable levels, too. 6 billion is way too few.
<br>
Humans are, as far as am aware, the most fascinating elements of the
<br>
universe, and, assuming we are alone, humans are the owners of everything
<br>
else. Morally, the life and wellbeing of humans (and possibly much of the
<br>
animal kingdom) takes precedence over everything else. If the plants have a
<br>
problem with this, they can grow a brain, then maybe we can talk about it.
<br>
<p>I've maintained for a while, although I don't mention it much here, that the
<br>
label &quot;transhuman&quot;, while useful as something to hang a bunch of concepts
<br>
on, is fundamentally redundant. I feel that all the concepts represented by
<br>
Transhumanism are attributes of what it is to be truly human. To merge with
<br>
and become our tools, is a path that naturally flows from the dawn of
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>To resist that, to limit the investigation into and use of technology, to
<br>
stultify, stagnate at a particular level of technology and say &quot;no more&quot;...
<br>
that is to be less than human. *That* is unnatural.
