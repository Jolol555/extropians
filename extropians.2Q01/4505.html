<p><em>&gt;Weather report from last August/September: VERY dusty.

(don't worry though about damage.. the particles are submicron).
<br>
Cassini, with our dust instrument, while still 1AU from Jupiter,
<br>
entered a Jovian dust 'storm', rather than Jovian dust 'stream' ... Io's 
<br>
volcanoes might have been very active near then.&lt;
<br>
<p>Excellent Amara. This weather report brings home the fact that travelling
<br>
out into space there is a CD containing a piece of writing that hundreds of
<br>
people have acknowledged and support. This piece of writing states many of
<br>
our values and dreams and is reaching far across the solar system.
<br>
<p>_______________
<br>
<p>Extropic Art Manifesto
<br>
<p>We are transhumans.
<br>
<p>Our art integrates the most eminent progression
<br>
of creativity and sensibility
<br>
merged by discovery.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am the architect of my existence. My art reflects my vision and represents
<br>
my values. It conveys the very essence of my being—coalescing imagination
<br>
and insight, challenging all limits.
<br>
<p>We are exploring how current and future technologies affect our senses, our
<br>
cognition and our lives. Our attention to  these relationships become fields
<br>
of art as we participate in the most immediate and vital issues for
<br>
transhumanity— extending life, augmenting intelligence and creativity,
<br>
exploring the universe.
<br>
<p>Artists, as communicators, bring together the passions, the dreams and the
<br>
hopes of transhumanity and express these emotions in ways that touch us
<br>
deeply.  Extropic Arts reflects an appreciation of aesthetics in a
<br>
technologically enhanced world.
<br>
<p>We are voices of transhumanity. Our voices are a synthesis, rhythm and
<br>
exploration of imagination.
<br>
<p>The Extropic Art Movement regards art as more than an artifact. Art
<br>
influences social and cultural change: how we live and who we are. It
<br>
creates a sense of self, art as being, autonomous yet connected to culture’s
<br>
continuum. How we accomplish our intentions is a matter of selective
<br>
individual choice—whether abstract or representational, whether artifact or
<br>
conceptual. Our criteria for art remain open and we welcome
<br>
cross-disciplinary innovations.
<br>
<p>As we move into the 21st Century, Extropic Art will suffuse the universe
<br>
around us. Our unique ingenuity will spread far out into the capillaries of
<br>
our culture. We are active participants in our own evolution from human to
<br>
posthuman. We are shaping the image—the design and the essence—of what we
<br>
are becoming.
