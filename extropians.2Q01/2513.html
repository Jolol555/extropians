<p><em>&gt;You find exploited child labor acceptable?
</em><br>
<p>If the alternative is no labor, and starvation, yes. These countries run at 
<br>
a very different level of &quot;comfort&quot; than we do, and what would be privation 
<br>
to us may well be a comfortable level of life to others.
<br>
<p>The definition of &quot;exploit&quot; can be used either to describe &quot;use&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;abuse&quot;. The actual definition must be left to those actually under the 
<br>
conditions in question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Ditto &quot;sweatshops&quot;. If the choice is between a twelve hour work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shift six days a week, and starvation, I would gladly work those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hours. ( I tend to do this anyway, but then, I am my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;exploiter&quot;!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For a pittance of a wage and a great deal of abuse? I doubt your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case is even remotely applicable.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes, I wonder about getting a second job - say at 7-11, where I would 
<br>
get a steady paycheck :)
<br>
<p>Again, the workers are free to rise up against the abuse. I see nothing 
<br>
wrong with concerned citizens of other nations providing help in this. The 
<br>
rulers of those countries might see it differently...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The fact that they have little choice doesnt make it right. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt;purchasing these goods you are ethically the same as the sweatshop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boss who mistreats these children.
</em><br>
<p>Again, if the boycott would drive the businesses out, these people will 
<br>
then not even have subsistence. Is this a good trade-off?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That would make me the jingoist Hal's accusing me of being. To buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these goods is to make yourself the ethical partner of those who do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the exploiting.
</em><br>
<p>See previous response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The Western world has enforced a blockade of Iraq for quite a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;years now, supposedly to &quot;punish&quot; Saddam Hussein for his invasion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of Kuwait and other antisocial acts. He is still comfortably in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;power, but millions of innocent Iraqis have suffered and died
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because of the blockade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bad plan, back to the subject.
</em><br>
<p>The point is - actions against the bosses usually trickle down to the 
<br>
oppressed, with the bosses shedding most, if not all, of the unpleasant 
<br>
effects. The only actions that could affect these sweatshop owners would be 
<br>
either enforced legislation in that country, or a successful labor action 
<br>
by the workers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When you buy the output of a sweatshop, you are not &quot;investing&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the third world.
</em><br>
<p>I mean INVESTING. Send over more work, and ensure that conditions are right 
<br>
in the plants. This has been working with US firms in Mexico.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Good for you, now make the connection, children who are forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work in sweatshops or starve are slaves.
</em><br>
<p>Slavery is slavery, regardless of the fancy name given it. Forced labor is 
<br>
slavery. What happens in these places if someone refuses to work - are they 
<br>
fired or shot? If they are fired, this implies that they can quit, also...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Excuse me? Read the history books, those who've tried to form
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unions have been killed in droves. Children forced to work in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sweatshops are slaves.
</em><br>
<p>And if they need to shed blood in their own countries to make the change, 
<br>
this is the price they pay for freedom. Revolutions are not neat and clean.
<br>
<p>I do not advocate that we invade these places and &quot;force&quot; them to change - 
<br>
but how else will the job get done? The people there must rise up and 
<br>
change their own lives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Travas has posted some excellent links.
</em><br>
<p>Still studying them. (Got to enslave myself a bit, or I don't eat)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Lets draw a distinction here, there is a BIG difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workers producing things in various countries at various wages and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the output of sweatshops, especially those who use child labor.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. I still think, though, that &quot;child labor&quot; is another hot button, 
<br>
and that many jobs can be safely and ethically done by &quot;children&quot; that are 
<br>
outlawed in this country, jobs that can spell the difference between 
<br>
adequate nutrition and death.
