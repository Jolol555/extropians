<em>&gt;From: &quot;John Marlow&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:johnmarlow@gmx.net?Subject=Re:%20MEDIA:%20Re:%20Last%20night's%20NOVA/FRONTLINE%20special&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104261418.HAA04209@well.com&gt;">johnmarlow@gmx.net</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Ooohboy. Africa. In a nutshell, here's the problem: It's always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been a mess, it continues to be a mess, and it probably always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be a mess. Yes it seems like the humanitarian thing to do, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bring food to the starving masses--and I do not argue against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this. Who could? But here is what happens--this causes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population to grow rapidly, producing a far larger crisis which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must be solved with far more  food, and so on ad infinitum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eventually, by saving the first bunch you have rather directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;caused the eventual and seemingly inevitable death-by-starvation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a far, far larger number of people.
</em><br>
<p>You've identified a primary problem, simply increasing the food
<br>
supply and the population could explode, obviously it must be dealt
<br>
with on more than one level simultaneously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You hand them the tech to provide for themselves, they won't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They're  too busy being oppressed by their own or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governments and slaughtered by warlords or neighbors.
</em><br>
<p>Remember the lessons we've learned, handouts don't work, teach them
<br>
to fish, just don't give them the fish....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The majority of the continent is a total write-off. Eventually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they'll eat the wildlife or destroy its food/water sources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kenya has it halfway together half of the time. A few of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;northern nations. The rest? Pfff.
</em><br>
<p>Part of why I am an extropian is to accelerate my own progress, but
<br>
I have a considerable amount of Buddhist ethic in me as well, and
<br>
this requires that I do what I can, when I can, to save as many of
<br>
the rest of sentient beings as I can.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We think we have problems? We have inconveniences. Just to be born
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here (US) with all your marbles to decent parents is 99.999999% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything you could want, when you think about it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't believe it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tour Eritrea.
</em><br>
<p>I'm somewhat familiar with Eritrea's problems, and as I said I
<br>
consider it part of being an Extropian that we address these
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>How many Eritreans are Extropians and don't know it yet?
