Besides the problem of handling the time boundaries of a limited-scale
<br>
simulation, there is the problem of space boundaries.  This was
<br>
demonstrated graphically in The Thirteenth Floor when the road disappeared
<br>
at the end of the desert.  But can we really assume that there was an
<br>
entire city of simulated people who never needed to leave Los Angeles?
<br>
This would require all kinds of hacks and patches.  Where does the food
<br>
come from?  The sim would have to materialize it and somehow cover up the
<br>
memories of people who knew.  There are thousands of industries which
<br>
require communication and transportation to other parts of the world.
<br>
All this would have to be hacked in.
<br>
<p>If we consider a sim which has a core of real people surrounded by a
<br>
bunch of zombies we have a similar problem.  It is rare for a group
<br>
to be completely self-contained in close relationships.  Most of the
<br>
real people will have at least some interaction with the zombies, and
<br>
in some cases it will be intimate and long-term.  Can a zombie really
<br>
fool a real person so completely?  It's hard to credit.
<br>
<p>A possible fix for both of these is what we might call &quot;partial zombies&quot;.
<br>
We could have real people surrounded by partial zombies, who are
<br>
surrounded by full zombies.  Partial zombies would have awareness
<br>
and consciousness but would not represent parties in the simulation.
<br>
In effect, they are actors.  They know about the sim (at least with some
<br>
parts of their minds) so they don't have to be fooled by the full zombies
<br>
- they accept that they're just stage extras.  But they are conscious
<br>
and aware and play the part necessary for the sim.
<br>
<p>This ends up with a scenario somewhat like The Truman Show, where Truman
<br>
was the only real character in the sim, and everyone else was an actor.
<br>
If they had had more technology they could have populated the rest of
<br>
the world with zombies as needed.
