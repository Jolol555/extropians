The quake was 7.0.
<br>
<em>&gt;Officially was downgraded to 6.8, one after shock of 3.4 14 hours later.
</em><br>
<p>Damage is, overall, fairly minor and there have been
<br>
almost no reports of injury.
<br>
<p>So the death of the 60 yr old woman doesn't count? And the 200 or so that had mostly head lacerations and other hospital required care, figments of our imagination I suppose...
<br>
How about Bush declaring our state a disaster area with FEMA participating and the millions of dollars and projected 3 years for repairs are also just political posturing?
<br>
<p>SeaTac Airport's control tower is out though. The FAA is bringing in a
<br>
tempory one of some sort.
<br>
<p>Two years ago SeaTac FAA employees took 3 travel trailers and converted them into makeshift 'towers'. They are on the tarmac and operational. Time of course is a bit slower to get planes in and out but its one of the first kind in the country - mobile units ready to rock n' roll when disaster strikes. Those units were up and running within one hour of the quake and were retrofitted in a hanger at SeaTac.
<br>
<p>Any more questions?
