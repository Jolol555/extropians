Absolutely. This doesn't make any sense.
<br>
<p>If there were no shortage, your salaries/rates would be lower than they are.
<br>
Then, where would the incentive be to get people from overseas?
<br>
<p>I also agree with Robert... these big orgs don't need to stuff around
<br>
getting H1-Bs into the country in huge numbers. They just set up *very
<br>
large* development shops in countries like india, and pay people with pretty
<br>
colored stones and stuff they found stuck in their shoe. It's smaller orgs
<br>
than that who would benefit from &quot;artificially&quot; getting cheap coders onsite
<br>
(orgs who don't understand teleworking, obviously), and they don't have the
<br>
clout to manipulate things.
<br>
<p>I've seen this line trotted out on slashdot before... it continues to make
<br>
no sense.
<br>
<p>btw, what makes you think that this growth in demand for geeks is a line of
<br>
crap? Maybe it's true.

last
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; year, when an org funded by Gates of Microsoft, and Larry Elison of

Oracle
<br>

be
<br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mitch, knowing Larry to the degree that I do, I very much doubt he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would cooperate with Bill on anything (even something that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their mutual advantage).  I would strongly urge you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigate the background sources on your comments.  While
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not implausible that they both may have contributed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such an effort, it would be *un*-likely that they did so knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the other was involved.  In which case the awards should go to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual behind the scenes that got them both to contribute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft and Oracle both have overseas software development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts.  To be promoting the emmigration of these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the U.S. seems counter productive.  You will always have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay them more within-U.S. relative to non-U.S. locations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To make a case that MSFT or ORACLE are behind this, you have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; offshore workers to the U.S. where the salaries would be higher.
