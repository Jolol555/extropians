<em>&gt; Very good for you. Now go get thine ass in gear, and join your university
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of choice. Start doing stuff instead of talking about doing stuff. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun, but the longer you wait, the harder it gets. Plan to start cranking
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Eugene, are you feeling all right?  This post would have made sense two
<br>
years ago.  Insulting, and condescending, but it would have made sense.  I
<br>
should now point out two things:
<br>
<p>1)  I already have the perfect job.  I would trade salaries with Bill
<br>
Gates, but not jobs.  I continue to work on the design, and when SIAI gets
<br>
the funding to hire another four or five programmers we can start coding. 
<br>
Why on Earth would I want to drop that so I can go to a university and not
<br>
start coding until I'm 25?
<br>
<p>2)  I'm 21 and already past your deadline.  Are you experiencing a
<br>
flashback to 1998 or something?
<br>
<p>Eugene, you now know that I'm not going to go to a university.  Period.  I
<br>
will notify you if that changes.  If you make further posts along these
<br>
lines, I will consider it not friendly advice, but a snide attack on my
<br>
reputation, and respond accordingly.
<br>
<p>I'm serious about this, Eugene.  We've discussed this before, and you've
<br>
been warned before.  I tolerated this when I was eighteen because it could
<br>
have been well-meant.  The plausibility of that hypothesis is now
<br>
dwindling towards zero.  You've been one of my steadfast (albeit
<br>
repetitive) critics where AI is concerned, and I nearly respect that, but
<br>
I can't respect this.  I don't know why you would suddenly decide your
<br>
goal in life is to trash my reputation, and it would be paranoid of me to
<br>
attribute to malice what I can attribute to well-meant condescension, but
<br>
it would be equally careless of me not to consider that I may be under
<br>
deliberate attack.  If you continue making these remarks, I will assume
<br>
that they are entirely malicious in nature.
