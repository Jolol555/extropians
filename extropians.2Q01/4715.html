<p>#Gotta take issue with this. Let us drop the &quot;people&quot; part and 
<br>
concentrate on &quot;beautiful.&quot; works of art with no humans in them, no 
<br>
representation of anything with any survival value, no relationship 
<br>
to anything any gene has ever come across--can move the person 
<br>
beholding it to tears. Beauty is indeed in the eye (or, more 
<br>
correctly, the perceptions) of the beholder--not the genes. The same 
<br>
principle applies to appreciation of personal beauty.

<p><p><em>&gt;Some people (Marx and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological basis of moral and aesthetic preferences).
</em><br>
<p>#Your own philosophy argues the impossibility of this--as we would, 
<br>
of course, choose to make only those changes which our biologically 
<br>
determinate genes would prefer we choose to make. Unless you favor 
<br>
computer-generated random mutations...

<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>#Oops, sorry; I thought the Borg Queen, at least, was kinda sexy, in 
<br>
a disturbingly bizarre way...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not a question that yields to reason, because people believe what they

</em><br>
<p>#But how can you be genetically predispositioned to believe that what 
<br>
you want to believe is genetically predispositioned--and me be 
<br>
genetically predispositioned to believe the opposite? Can we both be 
<br>
correct?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IOW, some of us are biologically programmed to want to transcend biology. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Edward O. Wilson put it in Consilience, The Unity of Knowledge, &quot;Homo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sapiens, the first truly free species, is about to decommission natural
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and decide what we wish to become.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>#But only as deep as our genes would have us look, eh? Or only in 
<br>
some cases?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Building on the convergence of human biology with its artifacts, Ray Kurzweil

</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent entities in considerably less time than it took the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process that created us. Human intelligence--a product of evolution--has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcended it. So, too, the intelligence that we are now creating in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers will soon exceed the intelligence of its creators.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; Emlyn &lt;<a href="mailto:emlyn@one.net.au?Subject=Re:%20The%20biological%20basis%20of%20the%20beauty%20meme&In-Reply-To=&lt;3B0D4E3C.21588.22502A@localhost&gt;">emlyn@one.net.au</a>&gt; uplifted the signal by summarizing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There's the intelligence augmentation approach, where we add things to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads to make ourselves smarter, and those things allow us to conceive more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mods to make which will make us smarter still, loop. Note that this could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotech/nanotech enhancements, resulting in a purely biological being,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than the traditional cyborg concept.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which I'd add that the traditional cyborg concept doesn't remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional for long when biotech accelerates biological evolution. I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first to envision a future in which nanobots (or suitable gene modifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carriers) injected into a chimpanzee alter the 3% genetic material which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separates the hairy ape from the naked one, so that Mr. Hyde (the chimp)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morphs into Dr. Jekyll (the homo sap). Similarly, a super sapient cyborg could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolve *overnight* from an ordinary human.
</em><br>
<p>#Hooboy; ethics. We've no business doing this to chimps. We wanna do 
<br>
it to ourselves on an individual basis, have at it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the difference whether posthumans emerge from biologically transformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans or from Kurzweillian machine intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>#The first is posthuman, the second is nonhuman. BIIIIG difference.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Either approach affords
<br>
<em>&gt; ample opportunity to reinstate the heritage of genealogical memories and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social identities that some of us would like to preserve (and some of us would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to discard).
</em><br>
<p>#Seems to be some confusion here. A nonhuman, machine-evolved 
<br>
intelligence will have no such heritage, and may not desire them. IT 
<br>
is, after all, nonhuman--and these are human attributes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It seems to me those who'd like to jettison the cultural
<br>
<em>&gt; baggage of the past have a slight advantage due to their willingness to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something entirely new and physically different. But first we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand in minute detail how our genes got us where we are. Otherwise we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde, causing irreparable damage along the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, we have no evidence that the AI path leads anywhere that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow.
</em><br>
<p>#or to anything truly &quot;intelligent&quot; at all.
<br>
<p><p>jm
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Hyper-accelerated bio-evolution, in contrast, simply takes a proven
<br>
<em>&gt; methodology and speeds it up so that we remain incarnate, although out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control (in the Kevin Kelly sense of &quot;out of control&quot; -- meaning that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future selves will decide how we will evolve in the future). Or as one wag has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written, &quot;Inside every older person is a younger person wondering what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell happened.&quot;
