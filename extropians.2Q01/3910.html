<p>I'm not **that** much of a snorter, or I wouldn't be here ;-&gt;
<br>
I'm still a secret believer in the Generalized Moore's Law.

<p><em>&gt; FPGAs don't compare favourably to brain's fanout and connectivity

</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, bring on the 3D packing, the fanouts, the connectivity, the
<br>
sheer number of active units.  The smell from the oven is starting to make
<br>
me salivate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [E]ven current FPGAs need not remain static. That they... typically [do]...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a more or less deliberate decision on the [part] of the implementer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She doesn't understand circuits which flip through configurations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [in the millisecond] range, especially if the circuits themselves decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on which next configuration to choose...
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Yes.  Yes!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, of course in computronium the signal-ducting nanofilaments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (encoded as special cell states) will also be packed in 3d, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit denser than in the real thing...
</em><br>
<p>Call my lawyer.  Call my stockbroker.  It's time to upload ;-&gt; .
<br>
<p>Life is a:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...prespecified problem [that] itself is shifting, and if you're embedded
</em><br>
into such a matrix the things are not nearly as deterministic...
<br>
<p>said the actress to the bishop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you don't realize what we've got here already even with these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid FPGAs. The brain has several levels of dynamics: the signalling,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which occurs on the (sub-)ms time scale, adaptation, which takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds, or longer, and the hardware reconfiguration, which takes minutes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours, or days.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; In FPGAs already you have two layers: the state which defines the hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connectivity with the state that hardware has at time t.
</em><br>
<p>Could you elaborate on that last sentence a bit?  I can't quite make
<br>
out what you're saying here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In flexibility, that framework is comparable to biology. What limits it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the braindead architecture of current FPGAs, the limited integration density,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole thing being fixed into flatland, and -- most importantly -- the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitations within designer's heads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of them are likely to remain a constant on the scale of two-three decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even people do adapt and learn -- occasionally.
</em><br>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to it (as are we all)!
