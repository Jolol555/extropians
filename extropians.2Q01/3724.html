<p>Yes, it definitely is. The only problem is implementing it - that is far
<br>
trickier, nearly AI-complete. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would we do it so that we rate the posts and not the posters?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then create a matrix such as was described previously?  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the computer reconnect the post ratings with the person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so as to make an ERA to allow Anders' filtered list of faves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could eventually write a subroutine that would keep track
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our favorite and most extropic posters and threads.   We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would tell the machine we have half an hour to read email, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, and it would automatically delete the junk and give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you half an hour's worth of stuff from your family, friends and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorite extropians, who got that way from writing cool stuff,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not just from being nice people offlist.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Using people as extropy-detectors is of course the best way today. One
<br>
way of detecting that at thread is interesting is that many extropic
<br>
people participate, so the thread could be weighted by the sum of the
<br>
ratings of the participating people, with some scaling for the length of
<br>
the thread. Unfortunately it is hard for humans today to distinguish
<br>
between a poster and his posts; even when judging the latter judgements
<br>
about the first creep in.
<br>
<p>There seems to be some instability in such a ratings system:  first, a
<br>
new thread will just have the score of the originator, so it might be
<br>
hard to detect even if it is good. Also, high ranked people become more
<br>
visible and have a greater chance of being highly ranked. Here we need
<br>
some form of &quot;conscience&quot; in the system that balances the concentration
<br>
of ratings. 
<br>
<p>What we must avoid is having a lot of parameters to tweak. In my
<br>
opinion, the best systems are always those that have no free parameters
<br>
because they adapt well on their own.
