<p>Umm. I wouldn't want to fund people who would have a chance to succeed, 
<br>
because it would be way too dangerous (sorry, don't believe in Friendly 
<br>
AIs). I wouldn't want to fund the people who wouldn't have a chance to 
<br>
succeed, because there are more worthwhile projects. Luckily, I'm not in
<br>
such a predilection, since not wealthy. Whew ;)
<br>
<p>If I *could* spare a nonnegligable fraction of a megabuck/year I would 
<br>
fund the nematode upload project (a kind of Nemasys on steroids). Speaking 
<br>
of which: MURG is right now in the process of doing just such a thing, 
<br>
purely on volunteer basis, in our copious (ha-ha) spare time. We could 
<br>
use a few more contributors, and be it only you're willing to do a few 
<br>
manual segmentations/traces on 30..60 MBytes pictures (so you'll need
<br>
a fat pipe, or lots of spare time and a flatrate dialup). But we'll also 
<br>
need database people and Java people, and volume reconstruction people, 
<br>
and numerics wonks, and a few more specialities I forgot.
<br>
<p>Drop me a line if you're interested.
