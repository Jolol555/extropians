</em><br>

<p>But some things really are hard to explain!  Isn't it true,
<br>
for example, that some things are a lot harder to explain
<br>
over the phone?  Well, some things are hard to explain, period.
<br>
For example, I don't enjoy explaining why the earliest sunset
<br>
occurs weeks before the shortest day, and the latest sunrise
<br>
occurs weeks after the shortest day, simply because it's very
<br>
difficult to explain.  Has to do, I think, with the unobvious
<br>
amount of background material that is needed for some
<br>
apparently simple phenomena.
<br>
<p>I don't quite understand the downside here.  The upside is that
<br>
for certain explanations, I can be forewarned that the going is
<br>
going to be rough...  (and so I can take a quick glance at my
<br>
watch and make a hasty exit :-)
