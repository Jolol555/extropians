<p>Yes. There are already some crackpot papers in lanl, and more are sure to 
<br>
follow. I have noted that more crackpot papers appear as PDF and HTML than 
<br>
LaTeX, so the format gives a slight hint, but there are of course many papers 
<br>
that slip through that primitive filter. In addition, there are of course 
<br>
plenty of bad papers around.

<p><em>&gt; Not only does this system need a

</em><br>
<p>What are the basic problems with reputation management? Some problems right 
<br>
off the cuff:
<br>
<p>* Need to get a critical mass of people involved with the system - competing 
<br>
standards weaken the systems quite a bit, and the interface has to be so 
<br>
simple even a Ph.D. can use it.
<br>
* The problem of mutually supporting cliques 
<br>
* Linking reputation to factual results and not just fashions or politics 
<br>
* Making reputations matter
<br>
<p>I have thought about some kind of &quot;reputation futures&quot; or other 
<br>
investment-like reputation system. You can invest reputation by endorsing a 
<br>
paper, and if the paper becomes well cited you gain reputation while if it is 
<br>
shot down you lose reputation.
