<em>&gt;Japan Hopes To Expand Commuter Distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by Peter Hadfield
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tokyo - April 14, 2000 - A revolutionary jet engine was unveiled at a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Tokyo aerospace show last week. Designed to power a new generation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commercial aircraft that will fly at five times the speed of sound, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hypersonic Transport Propulsion System (HYPR) is the brainchild of Japan's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;branch of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The heavy industry divisions of Kawasaki, Mitsubishi and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ishikawajima-Harima have teamed up to develop the engine, which is made up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of two types of jet engine mounted end to end: a turbojet in front and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ramjet at the back
</em><br>

<p>I'd heard of this dual engine proposal before.  Anyone here got any 
<br>
expertise and can say whether this is a workable concept?

<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
