<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Attorney's often charge a retainer fee before they will take on a case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I understand it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  if the attorney spends fewer hours on the case than expected (say, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defendant agrees to settle)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the attorney returns the unspent portion of the retainer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My question is:  how often do attorneys actually return a portion of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retainer?
</em><br>
<p>When I was actively practicing law I kept any retainers I received in a
<br>
separate trust account. The money would be transferred to the regular
<br>
operating account as bills were posted (we generally compiled bills once a
<br>
month except for tax returns, which were billed for upon completion and
<br>
delivery). When the amount in the trust account fell below a certain level,
<br>
the client would be asked to deposit more. I always kept the clients' money
<br>
in an interest bearing account, with interest accruing to the benefit of the
<br>
client, until IOLTA was passed. IOLTA (Which stands for &quot;Interest on
<br>
Lawyers' Trust Accounts&quot;) requires interest earned to go to into a fund to
<br>
be distributed to foundations that provide legal services to low-income
<br>
people. (to see Texas IOLTA's travels through the court system, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.e-a-w.org/texas.htm">http://www.e-a-w.org/texas.htm</a> and
<br>
<a href="http://www.wvbar.org/barinfo/lawyer/2000/march00/iolta.htm">http://www.wvbar.org/barinfo/lawyer/2000/march00/iolta.htm</a>. I've always
<br>
hated this law. The reasoning by which it's justified as not being an
<br>
unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot; is flaky to say the least.)
<br>
<p>I always returned any money left over in a client's retainer account. But
<br>
I've heard many people complain that lawyers make a point of billing enough
<br>
to use up the retainer. No doubt this is true in some cases.
