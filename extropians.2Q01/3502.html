<p>Perhaps there is a productive middle ground.  Some of us could say more
<br>
about precisely how the Singularity, and the technologies along the way,
<br>
can be applied to solving many of the problems that beset real people
<br>
right now.  We can produce and spread the memes of technology generally
<br>
and AI, NT and the Singularity in particular as answering the deepest
<br>
needs, hopes and dreams of human beings.  
<br>
<p>As part of this we also need more of a story about the steps up to
<br>
Singularity as involves the actual lives and living conditions of
<br>
people.  That we will muddle along somehow while a few of the best and
<br>
the brightest create a miracle is not very satisfying.  What kind of
<br>
world do we work toward in the meantime?  What do we do about poverty,
<br>
about technology obsoleting skills faster than new ones can be acquired,
<br>
about creating workable visions including ethics and so on?  What is our
<br>
attitude toward humanity?
<br>
<p>The world we make along the way will shape the Singularity and may well
<br>
determine whether it occurs at all.
