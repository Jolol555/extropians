<p>World's Largest Hard Drive
<br>
Can Save Every Scrap of Data
<br>
<p>BERKELEY, CALIF. -- From budget spreadsheets to vacation photos, we're
<br>
all
<br>
piling up vast amounts of digital information. So where's the best place
<br>
to
<br>
keep it all? John Kubiatowicz, a professor at the University of
<br>
California
<br>
campus here, says the answer is easy: everywhere.
<br>
<p>Mr. Kubiatowicz believes the way to protect information is to spread it
<br>
around. So he and a team of Berkeley researchers are developing
<br>
something
<br>
they call OceanStore, a global information storage system woven into the
<br>
Internet. They are essentially trying to build the world's largest hard
<br>
drive -- and then make it crash-proof.
<br>
<p>Spurring them on is the trend toward pervasive computing. Losing your
<br>
Palm
<br>
or suffering a PC crash can be traumatic enough, but what happens when
<br>
smart devices are all over the place? Eventually, gadgets like personal
<br>
health monitors and smart cars could wind up churning out data. Mr.
<br>
Kubiatowicz wants to make sure all that information doesn't just
<br>
evaporate.
<br>
<p>The approach faces huge technical hurdles, but it also raises big
<br>
questions
<br>
about information overload. Even if we can save every scrap of data,
<br>
should
<br>
we? How much reliability should we expect from our digital databanks?
<br>
And
<br>
once we figure out how to protect data from glitches and hackers, will
<br>
we
<br>
still be able to delete things when we want to?
<br>
<p>OUR STANDARDS today, Mr. Kubiatowicz says, are simply too low. &quot;People
<br>
are
<br>
resigned to losing information,&quot; says the 36-year-old computer science
<br>
professor, known as &quot;Kubi&quot; around the Berkeley campus. &quot;That's
<br>
ridiculous.&quot;
<br>
<p>He's right. Many of us treat the possibility of losing data as one of
<br>
the
<br>
costs of using technology. Corporations have gotten pretty good at
<br>
safeguarding central repositories like customer databases. But as
<br>
individuals, we're used to playing the odds. Sure, we know we should
<br>
back
<br>
up our important files more often. We should also eat less fat and work
<br>
out
<br>
more.
<br>
<p>More reliable personal computers have diminished the risk, but the
<br>
growth
<br>
of digital information means there's more at stake. Hearing Mr.
<br>
Kubiatowicz
<br>
describe OceanStore, I found myself thinking about the hundreds of
<br>
digital
<br>
photos stored on my home PC -- mostly of my two-year-old daughter, Abby.
<br>
To
<br>
the PC those files are just ones and zeros, but to me they're priceless
<br>
memories. I realized I hadn't backed them up in weeks.
<br>
<p>One way OceanStore would achieve reliability is redundancy. Files would
<br>
be
<br>
split into smaller, overlapping pieces before being scattered to servers
<br>
all over the network. Because the pieces would overlap, OceanStore could
<br>
reconstruct the original file using only a fraction of them. For
<br>
example,
<br>
Mr. Kubiatowicz says, a file divided into 64 overlapping chunks could be
<br>
rebuilt using just 16 fragments. If each of the original 64 pieces was
<br>
stored on a different server, you could knock out 48 OceanStore servers
<br>
without putting the original file at risk.
<br>
Join Tom Weber for a live discussion1 about OceanStore Monday at 2 p.m.
<br>
EDT. with Tom Weber and other WSJ.com readers
<br>
<p>That kind of redundancy isn't entirely new. Corporate networks routinely
<br>
duplicate data on separate disk drives to guard against mishaps. What's
<br>
innovative about OceanStore is the notion that this level of protection
<br>
should be available to everyone, everywhere, for all kinds of data.
<br>
<p>Thus, Mr. Kubiatowicz envisions your PC beaming its files to the
<br>
OceanStore
<br>
network over a cable or DSL Internet connection, while portable devices
<br>
such as a hand-held organizer or a digital camera might rely on wireless
<br>
connections. Devices would store and update files on OceanStore as soon
<br>
as
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>All of this would need to happen automatically, a feat that would make
<br>
the
<br>
synchronization between a Palm and a PC seem like child's play. Much of
<br>
that will depend on the continued growth of high-speed Internet
<br>
connections. And it will require proving to potential users that the
<br>
system
<br>
is both reliable and secure from hackers.

<br>
<p>IT'S TEMPTING to dismiss big ideas like OceanStore as blue-sky dreams.
<br>
The
<br>
dot-com bubble gave us Internet time, the warp-speed development of
<br>
business ideas. Against that backdrop, Mr. Kubiatowicz's vision seems
<br>
closer to geological time. He and his researchers are seriously
<br>
evaluating
<br>
what it will take to preserve digital information for 1,000 years.
<br>
<p>Who thinks in such terms anymore? The pace of digital culture makes
<br>
information seem like a disposable commodity, not something that
<br>
deserves
<br>
archival permanence. Yet today's random bytes may be tomorrow's family
<br>
heirloom or historical record.
<br>
<p>The OceanStore approach is firmly in step with the direction of
<br>
computing.
<br>
Such &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; technology has taken a lot of abuse lately, but the
<br>
struggles of a few hastily launched start-ups don't alter the fact that
<br>
distributed, decentralized approaches offer benefits. The distributed
<br>
nature of the Internet itself is the ultimate proof.
<br>
You can e-mail Mr. Weber at tweber@wsj.com3 or visit the E-World Center4
<br>
.
<br>
<p>The next step for OceanStore is to roll out a prototype network across a
<br>
number of university campuses. Mr. Kubiatowicz is thinking about a
<br>
business
<br>
model, too. He envisions it as a service you'd subscribe to, but one
<br>
operated by scores of companies. (IBM and EMC are already supporting his
<br>
research.)
<br>
<p>How much information should we save in this brave new world? Keep it
<br>
all,
<br>
Mr. Kubiatowicz says. Computers, not people, will wind up dealing with
<br>
most
<br>
of it, he predicts. &quot;Not too long from now, the fraction of information
<br>
that's never directly touched by humans will be huge,&quot; he says.
