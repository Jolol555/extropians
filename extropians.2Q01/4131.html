There is no opposition between egoism and altruism.
<br>
Don't believe pseudo-philosophers (particularly collectivist ones)
<br>
who will have you think so.
<br>
<p>See for instance Henry Hazlitt's &quot;Foundations of Morality&quot;

<p><em>&gt; --not from any altruistic sense, but from a practical one.
</em><br>
What does &quot;altruistic sense&quot; mean? How does it oppose practicality?
<br>
<p>You're resorting to false dilemmas between choices that are not even
<br>
mutually exclusive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Evolution is fine, fabulous. Natural selection is clumsy, slow, tyranical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and incredibly inefficient. Take it down from the pedestal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well put! It's long been my contention that where natural selection ends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artifical selection begins
</em><br>
Yet another false dilemma.
<br>
Man is part of nature.
<br>
Any artificial choice is also ipso facto a natural choice.
<br>
If you're going to oppose &quot;natural&quot; to &quot;artificial&quot;,
<br>
then you must establish a believable assessment of what this
<br>
&quot;natural choice&quot; would be in absence of humans.
<br>
Which is of course _completely_ meaningless in any case
<br>
were human behavior is considered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intelligent agents (ourselves, for instance)
</em><br>
So you think you're intelligent? prove it! I don't believe you, so far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then become responsible for their own evolution,
</em><br>
Here's a shameful hysteron-proteron.
<br>
There is no way in which intelligence makes responsibility possible.
<br>
Quite on the contrary, responsibility is the very principle behind
<br>
natural selection that made evolution possible, and that caused
<br>
intelligence (or at least, any trace thereof that can be found)
<br>
to appear, to begin with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see how it could be anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;natural&quot; for us to do so.
</em><br>
Remove your quotes, and consider how &quot;do so&quot; is generic in your sentence.
<br>
Then you'll have reached the tautology. Now, move on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;plain vanilla natural selection&quot;
</em><br>
Most of the natural selection ain't vanilla.
<br>
Although vanilla is indeed the product of natural selection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A similar perspective is presented much more eloquently in the last chapter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Wyn Wachhorst's The Dream of Spaceflight: Essays on the Near Edge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Infinity, a book I would highly recommend.
</em><br>
If your post was coherent with the ideas of this book, then I'd definitely
<br>
disrecommend it. But I prefer to think that your recommendation is worthless
<br>
in itself, and does not taint a book that might otherwise be admirable.

<br>
As far as natural selection applies to the human world, we don't ever get to
<br>
&quot;let nature decide&quot;, because we ARE part of that nature that decides. Hence,
<br>
any claim to &quot;let the nature decide&quot; is just a fallacy to promote one point
<br>
of view against others, or to ignore one's responsibilities.
