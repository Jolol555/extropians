I actually think a MJ II would likely become a better runner than MJ I
<br>
because of environmental factors; from childhood, his parents would interest
<br>
him in running, give him the best coaches, etc. because they would know that
<br>
under the proper conditions he would become a great runner. There could
<br>
always be accidents -- including genetic ones -- to prevent him from
<br>
reaching his predecessors' excellence but I bet that more than 50% of MJ
<br>
clones would be better than MJ himself in running.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I find the following a typical bizarre pseudo-argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;===========
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There appears to be little fear that human cloning will have a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect in sport. If say, Michael Johnson were cloned, the result would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;almost certainly not be the same world record-setter as the original,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;researchers say, because environmental, nutritional and motivational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factors also play significant roles in developing athletes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;If I'm the clone of Michael Johnson, I've got to bend myself into all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sorts of shapes to run, because genetically that's what I'm destined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be,&quot; Dr. Friedmann said. &quot;I run and run and run, and I can't ever get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anywhere. Then what am I? I'm a Michael Johnson who can't run. That's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nobody. That must be a crushing experience to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;learn you're not what you're genetically destined to be.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;===================
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree with the general moral sentiment, and that cloning will seldom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yield a xerox copy, partly due to stochastic developmental cascades, party
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because of the factors listed in the 1st par. BUT having allowed this, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely is the scenario in the 2nd? From infancy you are given this (perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soul-destroying) enhanced environment to make you MJ Mark II, and even so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you *can't ever get anywhere. Then what am I?* What indeed? A proof that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;god intervenes deliberately to turn one twin into a nebbish just to spite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impious cloners? This is question-begging of a remarkable order, I reckon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It might be true of an Einstein, of course, since it's surely harder to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replicate the unknowable experiences of a genius, and the multiple genes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved in creative intelligence presumably offer vastly more stochastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pathways to go haring off in different ways.
