Right--theoretically. (You'll notice it ain't called the Bill of 
<br>
Privileges.) The Supreme court has in fact stated that 
<br>
unconstitutional laws need not be obeyed.  Nevertheless, executive 
<br>
orders are in place which enable the President to &quot;suspend&quot; the 
<br>
Constitution and the Congress, and which forbid the Supreme Court 
<br>
from ruling against his actions. I wouldn't put a nickel on which way 
<br>
today's military would go in such an event. And the guys with the 
<br>
guns are make the rules.
