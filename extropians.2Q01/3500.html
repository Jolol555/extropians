<p><p>Exploring the biology of religious experience
<br>
<p>By RICH HEFFERN
<br>
NCR Staff
<br>
<p>Those who deeply and regularly pray report that when praying they feel at
<br>
one with the universe, unafraid of death and in awe of the Mystery they
<br>
connect with. Scientists have connected some of these people to instruments
<br>
that peer into the enchanted loom that is their brain, tracing the weaving,
<br>
flashing shuttles of their neural connections. They seek understanding of
<br>
the physical dynamics beneath those beatific experiences. They are probing
<br>
the biology of religion.
<br>
<p>Studies have been conducted by scientists in Canada, Britain and the United
<br>
States. A key researcher in the United States is Andrew Newberg, a physician
<br>
and fellow of the Division of Nuclear Medicine at the hospital of the
<br>
University of Pennsylvania Medical School, in Philadelphia. Newberg worked
<br>
closely with Eugene dAquili, a professor of psychiatry at the hospital, who
<br>
died in 1998. DAquili began doing neurological studies of religion more than
<br>
25 years ago. Newberg began his
<br>
association with dAquili 10 years ago.
<br>
<p>Their research suggests that religion is intimately interwoven with human
<br>
biology, that the brains structure, in fact, compels the spiritual urge and
<br>
that the brain has the capacity to make spiritual experience real. They use
<br>
the term neurotheology. Their
<br>
findings suggest religion and spirituality had anevolutionary function.
<br>
<p>DAquili and Newberg first published their research and findings in
<br>
scientific journals, then in a book titled The Mystical Mind: Probing the
<br>
Biology of Religious Experience, published in 1999 by Fortress Press, a
<br>
Lutheran publisher. Their new book, Why God Wont Go Away: Brain Science and
<br>
the Biology of Belief, was released by Ballantine Books on April 3. This new
<br>
book is a more popular reworking and update of their research.
<br>
<p>In their empirical work, these researchers constructed a model of what
<br>
happens in the brain during significant spiritual experiences by peering
<br>
into the gray matter of praying Franciscan nuns and meditating Tibetan monks
<br>
using what
<br>
is known as single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT).
<br>
Conclusions based on their laboratory findings and on what is already known
<br>
about brain function reveal surprising insights into the biological basis of
<br>
spirituality.
<br>
<p>Activation studies using image-scanning techniques have given us a detailed
<br>
picture of functions of the individual structures of the brain, according to
<br>
Newberg. We know which areas of the brain are associated with the five
<br>
senses, which are activated by motor behaviors, from jogging to making
<br>
high-fives. Scientists watch various parts of the brain turn on and off as
<br>
subjects do algebra, write verse or feel a cramp. More information comes
<br>
from studying patients with injuries or tumors in various areas.
<br>
<p>Neurobiological research, though, has largely bypassed religious experiences
<br>
and beliefs except that done by a handful of scientists.
<br>
<p>Until the 1970s, religious experience and activity were believed to be
<br>
purely cultural phenomena, a product of social conditioning, and not in any
<br>
way biological. Little effort was made to investigate the physiological
<br>
aspects of, say, ritual or chant. Thanks to the work of dAquili, Newberg and
<br>
their colleagues, the biological side is becoming an important component in
<br>
the study of human religious experience.
<br>
<p>Spiritual experiences are the inevitable outcome of brain wiring, said
<br>
Newberg. We believe that the human brain has been genetically wired to
<br>
encourage religious beliefs.
<br>
<p>The two scientists have identified areas of the brain that work together to
<br>
provide the network that underlies religious activities like prayer,
<br>
meditation or ritual. They have found evidence that, for example, liturgy
<br>
has an evolutionary survival value (see sidebar, page 16). The capacity for
<br>
mystical experience, they theorize, is a byproduct of sexual development in
<br>
the human. They think that the religious experiences people near death
<br>
commonly report have a neurological basis.
<br>
<p>Religious and spiritual experiences are typically highly complex, involving
<br>
emotions, thoughts, sensations and behaviors. These experiences seem far too
<br>
rich and diverse to derive solely from one part of the brain, according to
<br>
Newberg. It is more likely that many parts of the brain are involved. They
<br>
have evidence that both the arousal and quiescent systems, the most basic
<br>
parts of the bodys nervous system, are involved in religious activity. Also,
<br>
the limbic system, the old part of the brain that controls and conveys
<br>
emotions, seems to be a key player. Other brain organs like the
<br>
hypothalamus, amygdala and hippocampus participate, too.
<br>
<p>Newberg and dAquili point out that as soon as the human brain became
<br>
sufficiently complex in structure, mind took shape, consciousness sparked
<br>
into being. They use the terms mind and brain in the same way physicists
<br>
talk of light in terms of wave
<br>
and particle, two ways of looking at the same thing.
<br>
<p>Andrew Newberg was raised in the Jewish tradition; Eugene dAquili came from
<br>
the Catholic one. Newberg told NCR that his colleague and friend loved to go
<br>
to Mass, that his avid interest in religious liturgy and practice certainly
<br>
stemmed from this heritage. DAquili held a doctorate in anthropology. They
<br>
met when Newberg was a medical student; the combination of dAquilis
<br>
interests and Newbergs background in brain imaging allowed the two to move
<br>
forward in research.
<br>
<p>Hooked up to prayer
<br>
<p>Their lab work involved brain scans of experienced Tibetan Buddhist
<br>
meditators and Franciscan nuns seasoned in prayer. The investigative
<br>
technique they use is fairly simple, starting with a baseline scan of the
<br>
subjects brain state at rest. They then
<br>
hook her up to a long intravenous line. A simple string tied to a finger
<br>
allows the subject to signal to the doctors when she has entered the deepest
<br>
stages of her prayer. At that signal they inject a radioactive dye into the
<br>
line, wait for the prayer to finish, then trot the subject off to the SPECT
<br>
camera waiting in the Nuclear Medicine Department.
<br>
<p>The camera detects radioactive emissions. The injected tracer locks almost
<br>
immediately into brain cells and stays there for hours, so they soon have an
<br>
image of blood flow patterns as they occurred just moments after the
<br>
injection. Increased blood
<br>
flow to a part of the brain correlates directly with heightened activity.
<br>
Since neuroscience has a good idea of the specific functions performed by
<br>
brain regions, the SPECT images reveal what the brain was doing at the
<br>
moment of injection.
<br>
<p>Finished images (see photos) showed increased activity in the frontal lobes,
<br>
the attention area, and decreased activity in the posterior superior
<br>
parietal lobe. Biologists know that this latter area of the brain primarily
<br>
orients us in space, keeping track of which way is up or down, forward or
<br>
behind, and helping us judge distances and angles. Structures in this part
<br>
of the brain combine to form the orientation association area (OAA), which
<br>
must constantly generate a clear, consistent awareness of the
<br>
physical limits of the self in order for us to function without looking like
<br>
Buster Keaton, always stumbling and collapsing.
<br>
<p>Its the minds way of telling us the difference between us and everything
<br>
else, and its a function that must work all the time flawlessly so we can
<br>
get around. People who suffer injuries in this area have difficulty
<br>
maneuvering in space; they are unable to even get into bed or lie down once
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>The increased activity in the attention area was expected, since meditation
<br>
tends to focus the brain. Scientists know however that the OAA never rests,
<br>
according to Newberg, so what would cause the drop in activity in an
<br>
essential function area of the
<br>
brain?
<br>
<p>What if the area was working as hard as ever, but somehow the act of
<br>
meditating had blocked its flow of sensory input? We were fascinated by this
<br>
possibility, said Newberg. Does meditation blind the OAA deliberately? And
<br>
if the OAA has no
<br>
information upon which to work, what would the brain make of it?
<br>
<p>Newberg and dAquili write: Would the orientation area interpret its failure
<br>
to find the borderline between the self and the outside world to mean that
<br>
such a distinction doesnt exist? In that case the brain would have no choice
<br>
but to perceive that the self is endless and intimately interwoven with
<br>
everyone and everything the mind senses. And this perception would feel
<br>
utterly and unquestionably real.
<br>
<p>This is exactly how the empirical subjects and generations of people of
<br>
prayer before them have described their peak mystical moments: the
<br>
dissolving of boundaries between the self and everything else. A
<br>
13th-century Franciscan Angela of Foligno expressed it this way: I possessed
<br>
God so fully that I was no longer in my previous customary state but was led
<br>
to find a peace in which I was united with God and was content with
<br>
everything. Consult manuals of Zen meditation, texts from Hindus, Sufis or
<br>
Christian desert fathers on prayer and you will find the same generic
<br>
description, couched in the language of that particular culture and
<br>
tradition -- a description of unitary states.
<br>
<p>Newberg and dAquili believe that the neurological phenomenon known as
<br>
deafferentation, when a brain structure is cut off from sensory input
<br>
(afferents), is responsible for the experience of a unitary state.
<br>
<p>Newberg told NCR that there were differences found between the scans of the
<br>
Franciscans and those of the Tibetans. The sisters had been doing Centering
<br>
Prayer, which traditionally involves the interior repetition of a Christian
<br>
phrase or mantra, which leaves the praying person open to experiencing Gods
<br>
presence. Their SPECT scans showed activity in the right inferior parietal
<br>
lobe, a part of the brain known to be involved in evaluating the emotional
<br>
weight and inflection of
<br>
words, phrases. Someone with damage in that area would not be able to
<br>
evaluate, for example, the phrase, Get out of
<br>
here! as either a rejecting command or a slang phrase for disbelief. The
<br>
same deafferentation of the orientation area was observed as well. Its
<br>
interesting that the nuns prayer, which was more involved with words, showed
<br>
activation in the brains
<br>
word areas, Newberg said. Such findings reinforce the validity of the study.
<br>
<p>The machinery of transcendence
<br>
<p>The overcoming of the barriers between the individual and the Absolute is
<br>
the great mystical achievement, wrote William James more than 100 years ago.
<br>
Once revered as sages and seers in ancient and medieval societies, mystics
<br>
fell on hard times in the age of rationality, often being considered as
<br>
delusional or disordered. That is changing as a result of the recent
<br>
interest in all things spiritual.
<br>
<p>We now know the health benefits of spirituality. Significant research shows
<br>
that people who pray on a regular basis enjoy higher levels of psychological
<br>
health than the public at large, according to Newberg. Meditation, for
<br>
example, lowers blood pressure, heart rate and decreases anxiety and
<br>
depression. Ironically, the American Psychiatric Association listed strong
<br>
religious belief as a disorder in their diagnostic manual as late as 1974.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From relaxing in a tub after a hard day to the most profound prayer, the
</em><br>
brains complex functions, evolved over millions of years, make possible this
<br>
continuum of unitary states that culminate in the deepest religious
<br>
experiences. Throughout human
<br>
prehistory and history, write Newberg and dAquili, mystical techniques were
<br>
intuitively devised by shamans, saints, gurus, dervishes and spiritual
<br>
masters -- ways like prayer, chanting, meditation or ritual -- to trigger
<br>
the process of deafferentation, leading to various degrees of unitary
<br>
states, in turn perpetuating human spirituality.
<br>
<p>What evolutionary advantage do mystical states bring to human development?
<br>
<p>We suspect all this did not evolve initially for spiritual purposes.
<br>
Evolution doesnt plan ahead, said Newberg. Instead intermediate steps evolve
<br>
for their own reasons, like nubbins on small reptiles in the Cretaceous era
<br>
that made for better temperature control, then gradually elongated into more
<br>
complex webbing that made gliding possible, then full-fledged wings that
<br>
could be used for the first animal flight.
<br>
<p>We believe the neurological machinery of transcendence may have arisen from
<br>
the neural circuitry that evolved for mating and sexual experience, said
<br>
Newberg. Mystics use terms like bliss, rapture, ecstasy, exaltation. Its no
<br>
accident that this is also the
<br>
language of sexual arousal, Newberg and dAquili write. Scientists think the
<br>
quiescent and limbic systems evolved partly to link sexual activity to the
<br>
pleasurable experience of orgasm, with obvious evolutionary benefits.
<br>
Components of the limbic system are involved in the deafferentation process.
<br>
Psychologists have long known that play and social activity are not just
<br>
related to socialization but also influence development of the brain. Sex
<br>
and prayer are obviously not the same experience, said Newberg.
<br>
Neurologically they are quite different, but mystical prayer and sexual
<br>
bliss use similar neural pathways.
<br>
<p>There is a hopeful quality to their research, according to Newberg, since
<br>
mystical practice may be the best way to change human behavior for the
<br>
better in the long run. Consider that domination, greed, cruelty, violence
<br>
and all our other ills arise from an insufficient and insecure being, writes
<br>
Beatrice Bruteau, an expert on Eastern mysticism quoted in their new book.
<br>
Newberg adds that their work also sheds light on the problem of religious
<br>
intolerance. Incomplete unitary states might leave a person feeling hostile
<br>
to anyone who contradicts their vividly real experience of oneness with God
<br>
the Father, Allah or Jesus.
<br>
<p>The origins of theology
<br>
<p>Everything that happens to us or any action we take can be associated with
<br>
activity in one or more specific regions of the brain. This includes
<br>
necessarily all religious and spiritual activity and experiences. The only
<br>
place God can manifest Gods existence is in the tangled neural pathways and
<br>
physiological structures of the brain.
<br>
<p>The Word must be made electrochemical to spark across the synapses and
<br>
travel our fleshy nerve pathways.
<br>
<p>Religion persists because brain wiring continues to provide us with a range
<br>
of unitary experiences that are often interpreted as assurances that God
<br>
exists, write Newberg and dAquili. Although its unlikely that the
<br>
machineries of transcendence evolved
<br>
specifically for spiritual reasons, it seems obvious now that evolution has
<br>
picked up on these dynamics and favored the religious brain, they write,
<br>
because religious behaviors are good for us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the brains perspective, religion is a wonderful tool and will be around
</em><br>
for a long time to come. But were not saying thats all religion is, Newberg
<br>
said, just a trick biology plays on us to keep us healthy. They are
<br>
suggesting that the neurological basis for religion can be considered from
<br>
the biological or evolutionary perspective, or from others. Its also
<br>
probable that the brain structures and functions that allow spirituality to
<br>
happen are also ways to connect us with something real beyond the brain.
<br>
<p>These are questions for the new field of neurotheology.
<br>
<p>What are the implications for theology of studying religion as a
<br>
neurophysiological phenomenon? Scholars like Rudolf Otto, Mircea Eliade,
<br>
Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung devoted themselves to the study of the
<br>
phenomenology of religion, advancing our knowledge in significant ways. This
<br>
new research puts a biological foundation under them, Newberg said.
<br>
<p>Theology is a reasoned analysis applied to religious experiences and
<br>
beliefs. Its important to consider the functioning of the brain in
<br>
considering how we experience God. Newberg says that biology helps explain
<br>
why theology exists in the first place.
<br>
<p>Newberg and dAquilis work suggests that the complexity of the human brain,
<br>
with its billions of neural connections, a complexity that developed to
<br>
enable us to survive in hard and hostile environments like those of the Ice
<br>
Ages, drove, and still drive, us to, for example, find out what causes what.
<br>
In order to get by in a difficult world, Newberg and dAquili theorize that
<br>
the brain early on developed what they call a causal operator -- a
<br>
combination of brain and mind functions working together -- that must
<br>
continually search for and determine why this or that is happening.
<br>
<p>For example, that causal operator lets us be aware our fingers hurt because
<br>
we handled that hot coal. Research shows that this causal operator is a
<br>
function of the left association area and the left parietal lobe in the
<br>
brain working together. People who have strokes or tumors in brain areas
<br>
that contribute to the causal operator cant determine why something
<br>
happened.
<br>
<p>The causal operator never had an off switch, write Newberg and dAquili.
<br>
Maybe between hunts hundreds of thousands of years ago, a few of our
<br>
theologically inclined ancestors kicked back, relaxed and used their brains
<br>
causal operator in more abstract ways. Their musings eventually would take
<br>
causality back, says Newberg, until their minds stumbled up against the
<br>
notion of the uncaused cause.
<br>
<p>The brains causal operator has probably always driven us to speculate about
<br>
why we are here, what the purpose of the universe is, write Newberg and
<br>
dAquili. This function of the brain is genetically hardwired into all of us.
<br>
Also, the human brain, as soon as it was complex enough to develop a
<br>
self-aware mind, discovered death. Newberg and dAquili theorize that the
<br>
existential anxiety associated with knowing about death drove us to invent
<br>
myth-making ability and the capacity for ritual.
<br>
<p>Religion is partly the coinage of our unquiet thoughts. Early in human
<br>
development, it seems, our big brains cornered us into becoming liturgists,
<br>
religious storytellers and, of course, theologians.
<br>
<p>In February 2001, Bishop Elio Sgreccia, vice president of the Pontifical
<br>
Academy for Life, the Vaticans leading expert on bioethical issues and
<br>
medical research, responding to a news report on Newberg and dAquilis work,
<br>
said: You cant say its
<br>
the brain that causes prayer. That would be confusing the effect with the
<br>
cause. As for the idea that the feeling of being in Gods presence might
<br>
simply be the result of the brains activity, Sgreccia said that indicated a
<br>
mistaken, materialistic view of human actions.
<br>
<p>Newberg responded: One can look at our findings and interpret them in a
<br>
reductionist way, of course, and many of our critics do. Yet were not simply
<br>
saying that the brain creates God, rather that the brain has quite naturally
<br>
developed the mechanisms for religious experiences.
<br>
<p>Is religion, in other words, merely a product of biology -- a neurological
<br>
illusion -- or does the fact that our brains function in such a curious way
<br>
argue that God is not only real but reachable?
<br>
<p>What if biology has laid down neural paving stones leading to God?
<br>
<p>In their new book, Newberg and dAquili quote biologist Edwin Chargaff, who
<br>
thinks all real scientists are driven by the mysterious intuition that
<br>
something immense and unknowable dwells in the material world. If [a
<br>
scientist] has not experienced, wrote Chargaff, at least a few times, this
<br>
cold shudder down the spine, this confrontation with an immense, invisible
<br>
face whose breath moves him to tears, then he is not a scientist.
<br>
<p>The shrewd honesty that is the scientific method hints that in part God may
<br>
be an emergent presence, seeking to be known, within our own bodies, those
<br>
same bodies so denigrated by the old dualistic religious view that severed
<br>
spirit from matter.
<br>
<p>Scientist, nun, monk or layperson, we all have brains capable of feeling
<br>
those shudders and flesh on which can be raised the goose bumps of awe.
<br>
Humans, it seems, are literally made for contemplation.
