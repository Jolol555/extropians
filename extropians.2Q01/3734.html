<p>Well, here's what Bertrand Russell had to say about that (from &quot;Speaking Personally:
<br>
Bertrand Russell&quot;, a 1961 John Chandos interview originally released on a two-disc
<br>
LP set, Riverside 7014, 7015):
<br>
<p>5.  Background to National Greatness
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  What sort of conditions cause a nation to produce great men?
<br>
Now, I've always maintained that Shakespeare would never have written his
<br>
stuff if it hadn't been for our defeating the Armada.  I believe that the
<br>
sort of sense of successful energy that we got from that was essential to
<br>
the greatness of the Elizabethan age.  That's very disputable; it's only
<br>
a hypothesis.  I don't think it's very easy to say, but it seems to me,
<br>
looking over history, that countries which have been politically powerful
<br>
and then ceased to be, do lose culturally.  People who might be culturally
<br>
great cease to have the self-confidence that is necessary.  Because to do
<br>
anything great you have to have **enormous** self-confidence:  'Well, I'll
<br>
do this whatever people say...'  because **everybody** will say you're
<br>
wrong!
<br>
<p>The man who thinks originally has at all times I think, in every
<br>
country and in all ages, been exposed to persecution.  Buffon, who
<br>
contributed enormously to zoology and geology, was compelled by the
<br>
Sorbonne solemnly to withdraw the opinion that some of the mountains
<br>
that now exist did not exist when the world was older.  And Vesalius,
<br>
who first dissected bodies for medical reasons, was sentenced to go
<br>
on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and lost his life through shipwreck
<br>
on the way home.  And Galileo, we know, was condemned by the
<br>
Inquisition.  And in general you may say that great innovators,
<br>
for the most part, have suffered...  Einstein, of course, had to
<br>
leave Germany.  And... it's the fate of them, but they think it
<br>
worthwhile.
<br>
<p>I think that liberty, in many of its forms, is almost bound to be
<br>
less than it was in the 19th century or in the later parts of the
<br>
18th.  You cannot do your work as an individual, unless you
<br>
happen to be something like a poet or a...  well, it's no good
<br>
being a composer, because then you'd have to get people to
<br>
perform your music.  But a poet can be an individual still.
<br>
But most people can't.
<br>
<p>I think the effect of the growth of authoritarianism will be
<br>
extremely unfortunate.  I think that it'll spread to other countries;
<br>
I think America, in all that we don't like, is the pattern of the
<br>
future for us -- it's what we shall be.  And I think that the
<br>
arts generally, and especially literature, will suffer very
<br>
much.  But there will always be some rebels, some who manage to
<br>
produce immortal work before they're put to death.  And that's
<br>
what we've got to hope for.
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>Russell also says (in _The Conquest of Happiness_ (1930), Chapter 9,
<br>
&quot;Fear of Public Opinion&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;It is customary in these days of psychoanalysis to assume that, when
<br>
any young person is out of harmony with his environment, the cause
<br>
must lie in some psychological disorder.  This is to my mind a complete
<br>
mistake.  Suppose, for example, that a young person has parents who
<br>
believe the doctrine of evolution to be wicked.  Nothing except
<br>
intelligence is required in such a case to cause him to be out of
<br>
sympathy with them.  To be out of harmony with one's surroundings is of
<br>
course a misfortune, but it is not always a misfortune to be avoided
<br>
at all costs.  Galileo and Kepler had &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot; (as they
<br>
are called in Japan), and so have the most intelligent men of our
<br>
own day.  It is not desirable that the social sense should be so
<br>
strongly developed as to cause such men to fear the social hostility
<br>
which their opinions may provoke.  What is desirable is to find ways
<br>
of making this hostility as slight and as ineffective as possible.
<br>
<p>In the modern world the most important part of this problem arises
<br>
in youth.  If a man is once launched upon the right career and in
<br>
the right surroundings, he can in most cases escape social persecution,
<br>
but while he is young and his merits are still untested, he is liable
<br>
to be at the mercy of ignorant people who consider themselves capable
<br>
of judging in matters about which they know nothing, and who are
<br>
outraged at the suggestion that so young a person may know better
<br>
than they do with all their experience of the world.  Many people who
<br>
have ultimately escaped from the tyranny of ignorance have had so
<br>
hard a fight and so long a time of repression that in the end they
<br>
are embittered and their energy is impaired.  There is a comfortable
<br>
doctrine that genius will always make its way, and on the strength
<br>
of this doctrine many people consider that the persecution of
<br>
youthful talent cannot do much harm.  But there is no ground whatever
<br>
for accepting this doctrine.  It is like the theory that murder
<br>
will out.  Obviously all the murders we know of have been discovered,
<br>
but who knows how many there may be which have never been heard of?
<br>
In like manner all the men of genius that we have ever heard of
<br>
have triumphed over adverse circumstances, but that is no reason
<br>
to suppose that there were not innumerable others who succumbed
<br>
in youth.  Moreover it is not a question only of genius, but also
<br>
of talent, which is just as necessary to the community.  And it is
<br>
not only a question of emerging somehow, but also of emerging
<br>
unembittered and with unimpaired energy.  For all these reasons
<br>
the way of youth should not be made too hard.
<br>
<p>While it is desirable that the old should treat with respect the
<br>
wishes of the young, it is not desirable that the young should
<br>
treat with respect the wishes of the old.  The reason is simple;
<br>
namely, that in either case it is the lives of the young that
<br>
are concerned, not the lives of the old.  When the young attempt
<br>
to regulate the lives of the old as, for example, by objecting
<br>
to the remarriage of a widowed parent, they are quite as much in
<br>
the wrong as are the old who attempt to regulate the lives
<br>
of the young.  Old and young alike, as soon as years of discretion
<br>
have been reached, have a right to their own choices and if
<br>
necessary to their own mistakes.  Young people are ill-advised
<br>
if they yield to the pressure of the old in any vital matter.
<br>
Suppose, for example, that you are a young person who wishes to
<br>
go on the stage, and that your parents oppose the wish, either on
<br>
the ground that the stage is immoral or on the ground that it
<br>
is socially inferior.  They may bring every kind of pressure to
<br>
bear; they may tell you that they will cast you off if you ignore
<br>
their commands, they may say that you will certainly repent
<br>
within a few years, they may mention whole strings of horrid
<br>
examples of young people who have been rash enough to do what
<br>
you contemplate doing and came to a bad end in consequence.
<br>
They may of course be right in thinking that the stage is not
<br>
the career for you, it may be that you have no talent for acting,
<br>
or that you have a bad voice.  If this is the case, however, you
<br>
will soon discover it from theatrical people, and there will
<br>
still be plenty of time to adopt a different career.  The
<br>
arguments of parents should not be a sufficient reasons for
<br>
relinquishing the attempt.  If, in spite of all they say, you
<br>
carry out your intention, they will soon come round, much
<br>
sooner in fact than either you or they suppose.  If on the
<br>
other hand you find professional opinion discouraging, that
<br>
is another matter, for professional opinion must always be
<br>
treated with respect by beginners.&quot;

<p><em>&gt; I &lt;heart&gt; the Bayesian Probability Theorem.  More and more, I have come

<p><p>&quot;Don't put your daughter on the stage,
<br>
Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
don't put your daughter on the stage.
<br>
<p>The profession is overcrowded,
<br>
and the struggle's pretty tough,
<br>
and admitting the fact
<br>
she's burning to act,
<br>
that isn't quite enough.
<br>
<p>She has nice hands,
<br>
to give the wretched girl her due,
<br>
but don't you think her bust is too
<br>
developed for her age?
<br>
<p>I repeat, Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
sweet Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
don't put your daughter on the stage.
<br>
<p><p>Regarding yours, Dear Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
of Wednesday the twenty-third:
<br>
<p>Although your baby
<br>
may be
<br>
keen on a stage career,
<br>
how can I make it clear,
<br>
this is not a good idea?
<br>
<p>For her to hope, dear Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
is on the face of it absurd!
<br>
<p>Her personality
<br>
is not in reality
<br>
exciting enough
<br>
inviting enough
<br>
for this particular sphere.
<br>
<p><p>Don't put your daughter on the stage,
<br>
Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
don't put your daughter on the stage.
<br>
<p>She's a bit of an ugly duckling,
<br>
you must honestly confess,
<br>
and the width of her seat
<br>
would surely defeat
<br>
her chances of success.
<br>
<p>It's a loud voice,
<br>
and though it's not exactly flat,
<br>
she'll need a little more than that
<br>
to earn a living wage.
<br>
<p>On my knees, Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
please, Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
don't put your daughter on the stage.
<br>
<p><p>Don't put your daughter on the stage,
<br>
Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
don't put your daughter on the stage.
<br>
<p>Though they said at the school of acting
<br>
she was lovely as Peer Gynt,
<br>
I'm afraid on the whole
<br>
an ingenue role
<br>
would emphasize her squint.
<br>
<p>She's a big girl,
<br>
and though her teeth are fairly good,
<br>
she's not the type I ever would
<br>
be eager to engage.
<br>
<p>No more buts
<br>
Mrs. Worthinton,
<br>
**nuts**
<br>
Mrs. Worthington,
<br>
don't put your daughter on the stage!
