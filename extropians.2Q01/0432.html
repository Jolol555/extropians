<p>
I received more than a hundred resend mails yesterday; I send a mail just
<br>
before it happens. I think you all deleted them without regards as I do,  so I
<br>
am resending my questions to the list.
<br>
<p>I am preparing a draft paper on actual trends in evolution, and I consider
<br>
points like these:
<br>
<p>- A hundred years from Mendel압 work revisited by de Vries and others and the
<br>
completion of the human genome sequence is not a good short term prospect 
<br>
- Some sudamerican tribe demands for his blood taked by  genome project압
<br>
people. Like this Argentinean who, at divorce time, demands for the kidney he
<br>
gave to his wife.
<br>
- Projects as robots압creensaver may apart us from their reproduction process
<br>
- Biological viruses has 3 basic functions: to find a host, to alter its
<br>
information status, to replicate itself.  Virus programs are the same. When we
<br>
will have an interfase with them?
<br>
- When a pilot sits at a flight simulator, who of them is learning at all?
<br>
<p>What kind of evolution we pretend to lead?
<br>
<p>I wrote
<br>
&quot;But, the fewer the genes the easier monster production will be, don앖 you
<br>
think so?&quot;
<br>
<p>I appreciate replies from  Jeff Davis and Eugene.Leitl, particularly
<br>
&quot;transrodent conspiracy&quot; new concept. I think philosopher압 job is the new
<br>
concepts creation. Not so bad, Jeff.
<br>
<p>If genes are fewer, it means greater body codification by each one. It makes
<br>
difficult to predict how this complex network of interactions will react. 
<br>
Hazard has lead evolution, how we will stop it?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, is this dreamed evolution for all people, or do we have to
<br>
consider more than one human specie, as when we share with Neanderthals, and
<br>
possibly help to their extintion?
<br>
<p>Or it is been considered from now on?: &quot;What is it that societies as disparate
<br>
as those we find in Colombia, Nigeria and Burma have in common that has held
<br>
them back from the benefits of real modernism? Why have attempts to aid
<br>
development in these  countries proved so ineffective for so long? &quot;
<br>
<p>What real modernism is? 
<br>
Do you really know what US aids here in Colombia is for? 
<br>
Only *real modernist 1st and 2nd world* will become postmodern posthumans?
<br>
<p>Any serious comment, gentlemen?
