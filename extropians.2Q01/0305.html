</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; defeatism that permeates modern religion.  Either way, the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untestability and scientific inaccessibility is clearly a modern

<em>&gt; innovation created by a bunch of theologians who, not to put too fine a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point on it, insisted that the Earth was flat and six thousand years old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and got their butts kicked (by Truth, not Science) and have been running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scared ever since.
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, you have little business claiming that you know what is and is
<br>
not a part of the truth so vigorously that you disown all spirituality
<br>
in one fell swoop.  One of the inaccessible truths is the creation of a
<br>
working vision that unites the hopes and dreams of a people.  Religions,
<br>
for good an ill are much more advanced in that work than science is. 
<br>
And it strikes me, headed into Singularity, that we deeply need a vision
<br>
of where we wish to go and what kinds of beings we wish to become and
<br>
create.  You take that task very much to heart in the creation of your
<br>
Sysop.  Yet your model and goal of Friendliness  and the Sysop itself
<br>
cannot be subjected to falsification tests either.  Are
<br>
goal/vision/ethical systems rigorously testatable and falsifiable?  Do
<br>
we absolutely require them in any case? 
<br>
<p>The six thousand years thing doesn't really hold water and weakens your
<br>
point. That was a calculation by one religious person in one
<br>
denomination of one religion.  Granted you can find wacky wrong headed
<br>
things in many/most/all religions.  Granted you need the power of
<br>
science to sort out what can be sorted out.  But I would hesitate to
<br>
make the leap from there to the notion that all that science cannot sort
<br>
out (yet) is therefore false, meaningless (not even false) and of no
<br>
worth at all.   
<br>
<p>Religion is running scared?  Really?  Then why are the numbers of
<br>
religious holding steady and even growing?  Perhaps it is because of a
<br>
bit more than just human stupidity and perversity.  Perhaps the
<br>
religions, even with all the blatantly wrong-headed and bad aspects,
<br>
offer something that human beings strongly need/desire in their lives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So now we have theologians who not only make excuses for past failures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but make up further excuses in advance.  Present them with any scenario in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which their beliefs are tested, and they'll immediately start making up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excuses in advance for why they'll fail.  The thought that they might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeed doesn't even occur to them - defeatism, pure and simple.  I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the excuses they're making up in advance conform exactly to the ideals of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious faith, but whatever part of their brain is deciding which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results they'll probably need to make excuses *for* is so perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atheistic that not even Daniel Dannett could disapprove.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with much of this.  In my opinion an honest modern theology has
<br>
to say that we don't know if God (or Powers) already exist or that they
<br>
will exist (and much we do here is about their creation).  It should be
<br>
about what is our possibility and what that means to us and how we be. 
<br>
That is more than enough in light of the approaching Singularity to
<br>
hinge all of meaningful spirituality with all of its best vision, hope,
<br>
committment and joy. 
<br>
<p>We stand on the brink of being able to produce all the miracles and
<br>
acheive all of the goals that most religions talk about.  We approach
<br>
the gate leading to the Transcendence of all that we are.  This is not a
<br>
place for passive waiting but for walking forward with a song in our
<br>
hearts and a growing vision and confidence in what it is that we wish to
<br>
acheieve.  
<br>
<p>Your Sysop is a Power (at least the beginnings of one), as powerful as
<br>
many notions of God.  It is created to protect us from our own
<br>
destructiveness and to end all suffering of humanity.  It has very
<br>
strongly similar tones to much religion/spirituality. Not all
<br>
spirituality or all religions are the simple-minded excesses and
<br>
mistakes habitually brought up on this list to be jeered at.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Modern theology has suffered a total failure of confidence.  The Books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate very clearly that religions are supposed to be testable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans innately expect people with religious power to predict the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and heal the sick.  Modern theologians can't heal diddly, which was fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back when nobody else could either, but now that technology has come along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're scared sick that somebody's going to notice the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making big claims and delivering on them.  But that is simply not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science's problem.  It gets solved either when another prophet comes along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who can actually heal the sick, or when religion finally folds in and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admits it was a lie all along.  Either way, theology's failure to live up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to its own expectations has nothing to do with science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Religion is not a lie so much as the hope for that which is not yet
<br>
seen.  Now we are in the process of creating and thus seeing it.  This
<br>
is not the end of religion but the fruition of all the deep human dreams
<br>
and yearning embedded in it.  The theologians, if they had their wits
<br>
about them, would not be trembling in fear but rushing to embrace the
<br>
magnificent and utterly awesome bounty opening to humanity.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not playing this game.  Every time I say &quot;Well, if we have immortal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; souls, then they'll show up in a nondestructive brain scan&quot;, the other
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, Eliezer, if we don't have &quot;immortal souls&quot; we will quite soon have
<br>
full backups of our complete mental/personality patterns redundantly
<br>
stored in your beloved Sysop and elsewhere.  That will do quite nicely
<br>
in their place.  If your Sysop or science yet invented can do this and
<br>
can furthermore transfer this &quot;essence&quot; from body to body to computer
<br>
and so on, then why exactly are you so hot to put down the idea of souls
<br>
per se?  Whether it is a notion from a &quot;golden age&quot; where what we now
<br>
see as possible was real, or a &quot;mere&quot; wish for what is not, or a vision
<br>
of what will/could be, the idea of an essence free from this particular
<br>
flesh is not ridiculous at all.  It is closer to being an everyday
<br>
reality now than it has ever been.  
<br>
<p>If your Sysop and other Powers can exist then exactly how the heck do
<br>
you know for an absolute fact that such beings and ones beyond even your
<br>
vision and imagining don't already exist?  How do you know that you are
<br>
not already backed up or in a VR or training program or are simply part
<br>
of the timeline of the becoming of a Power that will/has loop[ed] back
<br>
on its own timeline?  Because you see no evidence?  If such a reality
<br>
was the truth then you would not see any such evidence by necessity
<br>
and/or design.  
<br>
<p>If God is not then God will be.  If God will be then God is. Time is an
<br>
illusion, especially in the presence of God.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Draw a line in the sand, theologians!  Pick a place where you stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retreating!  Put up or shut up!  Say that the upload will die on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spot.  Say that he'll turn into a remorseless killer.  Say that he'll lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all his artistic creativity.  Say that we'll find the neurons are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something incomprehensible.  Say that no amount of experimentation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever explain it enough to correctly predict a single neuron.  I can plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the possibility of a religious universe if you'll tell me how it looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from a totally materialist universe, but as long as you go on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using rabidly atheistic Outcome Predictors, then I'm sorry, but there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing I can do for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Having fun ranting?  :-)  This neo-thelogian does not have to put up or
<br>
shut up.  You are in the process of creating the reality that all the
<br>
fingers pointing at the moon point to.  I am content that you get on
<br>
with it.
<br>
<p>A materialist universe looks exactly like a religious universe once you
<br>
have continuously self-augmenting Powers running about.  Especially if
<br>
they are able to manipulate space-time directly.  It is not the simple
<br>
minded relgious universe that the religions have largely de-generated
<br>
into.  But it is not simple materialism either.
