</em><br>
<p>True.  But if one practices explaining it to oneself as one would
<br>
explain it to a novice, or a child (if that metaphor is clearer), then
<br>
one can find ways to explain it to others easier...and, not
<br>
infrequently, come to understand it better oneself.  At least, I have
<br>
used this technique myself when faced with confusing collections of
<br>
facts, and I feel that I understand those things better as a result,
<br>
though I am not certain how I could objectively test this.  I have
<br>
found that for even the most difficult problems, repeating this
<br>
technique has allowed me to eventually boil anything I have tried it on
<br>
down to layman's terms.  This happens most often through a combination
<br>
of finding commonly-used terms that adequately describe a concept, of
<br>
finding commonly known concepts with a small and clearly describable
<br>
set of differences from the concept being explained, and of determining
<br>
what large sections of complexity can be reduced to a few statements
<br>
while hiding the details from the basic explanation (with the
<br>
understanding that, if those details are desired, they can be requested
<br>
after the basics are digested).
