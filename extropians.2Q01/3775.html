Not to descend to slushdottie type of &quot;argumentation&quot;, but it seemed well
<br>
worth citing.

<p>Microsoft's Attack on Open Source: Linus Torvalds Replies
<br>
<p>Posted on Thursday, May 3, 2001
<br>
<p>I asked Linus Torvalds what he thought of Craig Mundie's speech about open
<br>
source. His reply:
<br>
<p>I guess I'm not all that surprised. The basic argument seems to be that
<br>
it's good for the economy to charge for intellectual property, so open
<br>
source software cannot be good, while Microsoft is the most far-thinking
<br>
company around and is doing it all for the good of the public.
<br>
<p>Gee, what a surprise.
<br>
<p>His claim seem to focus on the assertion that research and development is
<br>
founded on the principles of &quot;the importance of intellectual property
<br>
rights&quot;. Which is entirely ignoring the fact that pretty much all of
<br>
modern science and technology is founded on very similar ideals as open
<br>
source.
<br>
<p>When Mundie wants you to think about all the work that companies have done
<br>
in order to get patents, he also wants you to forget about all the work
<br>
done by people like Einstein, Rutherford, Bohr, Leonardo da Vinci and a
<br>
lot of other people who have done a lot more for humanity than most
<br>
companies have ever done.
<br>
<p>And those people did it for the love of the art, not for some petty
<br>
&quot;intellectual property rights&quot;. Yet Mundie with a straight face claims
<br>
that those intellectual property rights are the thing that drives science
<br>
and technology. He seems to think that MS has done more for the US economy
<br>
than the discovery of the electron ever did.
<br>
<p>His &quot;shared source philosophy&quot; is nothing but the status quo for
<br>
Microsoft, and trying to make that status quo sound more like the open
<br>
source model.  He obviously doesn't &quot;get&quot; it.
<br>
<p>The strength of open source is not the source, but the intellectual
<br>
property that goes with it - exactly the part that Mundie seems to hate so
<br>
much.  The fact that when you get involved in open source, you get equal
<br>
rights to be involved. You can be another Leonardo da Vinci, you aren't
<br>
relegated to just paying for viewing his works.
<br>
<p>I wonder if Mundie has ever heard of Sir Isaac Newton? He's not only
<br>
famous for having basically set the foundations for classical mechanics
<br>
(and the the original theory of gravitation, which is what most people
<br>
remember, along with the apple tree story), but he is also famous for how
<br>
he acknowledged the achievement:
<br>
<p>&quot;If I have been able to see further, it was only because I stood on the
<br>
shoulders of giants&quot;.
<br>
<p>One of the greatest scientists of our time, having done more for modern
<br>
technology (and thus, btw, for the modern economy) that Microsoft will
<br>
ever do, acknowledged the fact that he did so by being able to use the
<br>
knowledge (what we now call &quot;intellectual property&quot;) gathered by others.
<br>
<p>Mundie throws all that away, because he wants Microsoft to own it all, and
<br>
make tons of money on it.
<br>
<p>I'd rather listen to Newton than to Mundie. He may have been dead for
<br>
almost three hundred years, but despite that he stinks up the room less.
<br>
<p>Linus
