<p>No, and working on freeing up the funds for cryo.  (Probably will be
<br>
for a while: I am both richer and poorer than most, depending on how

one measures available funds.)

<p><em>&gt; Eliezer's point applies to you:  what if your physical

</em><br>
<p>Unlikely to come up in reality, at least any time soon.  Current copy
<br>
can obtain resources to spawn an additional 10^9, once how to do mass
<br>
production spawning has been figured out (which, unfortunately, it
<br>
hasn't yet).  Using current resources to run more copies is likely to,
<br>
instead, be overridden by using current resources to enhance current
<br>
copy, at least for the entity typing these words or any near-term
<br>
version thereof.  This may be considered sociopathic relative to the
<br>
copies that would otherwise have been created, but that's what exists
<br>
here at the moment...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the principle that &quot;duplicates are self&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you won't have any trouble with this.  If you don't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then &quot;you&quot; simply will be missing out on a lot!
</em><br>
<p>Slightly different take: duplicates *were* self at the moment of
<br>
branching, but from that moment on, each duplicate is its own
<br>
individual.  After the run starts, each duplicate no longer views the
<br>
other duplicates, with different running histories and largely
<br>
identical but not completely so decision matricies, as &quot;self&quot;.  Each
<br>
instance will want its own, relatively recent, backup if near term
<br>
termination is a serious threat, so that not too much of &quot;self&quot; is
<br>
lost.  (Note that a suspended &quot;self&quot; at prior point is still considered
<br>
&quot;self&quot;, but a simultaneously and independently running &quot;self&quot; is
<br>
considered someone else.  Possible solution: allow these &quot;selves&quot; to
<br>
share experiences by some high fidelity link, so they can merge
<br>
themselves back into one identity.)
