Dear Extropes,
<br>
<p>The Sun's magnetic pole recently flipped. (Indication of solar max)
<br>
<p>For those of you doing models and calculations for the heliosphere,
<br>
you should flip the sign. Dynamics that involve the magnetic field
<br>
(i.e. solar wind) will have a different behavior.
<br>
<p>For interstellar dust coming into our solar system, the particles are
<br>
_focussed_ now, instead of bent away from the inner solar system.  It
<br>
takes about 20 years for dust particles to travel from the heliosphere
<br>
edge to our inner solar system, anyway, but in about 5 years, at the
<br>
Earth, we should start seeing an increase in the number of
<br>
interstellar particles detected.
<br>

<p>The Sun Does a Flip
<br>
NASA Science News
<br>
<p>NASA scientists who monitor the Sun say that our star's awesome magnetic
<br>
field is flipping -- a sure sign that solar maximum is here.
<br>
<p>February 15, 2001 -- You can't tell by looking, but scientists say the Sun
<br>
has just undergone an important change. Our star's magnetic field, which
<br>
extends through the distant reaches of interplanetary space, has flipped.
<br>
<p>The Sun's magnetic north pole, which was in the northern hemisphere just a
<br>
few months ago, now points south. It's a topsy-turvy situation, but not an
<br>
unexpected one.
<br>
<p>&quot;This always happens around the time of solar maximum,&quot; says David Hathaway,
<br>
a solar physicist at the Marshall Space Flight Center. &quot;The magnetic poles
<br>
exchange places at the peak of the sunspot cycle. In fact, it's a good
<br>
indication that Solar Max is really here.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Sun's magnetic poles will remain as they are now, with the north
<br>
magnetic pole pointing through the Sun's southern hemisphere, until the year
<br>
2012 when they will reverse again. This transition happens, as far as we
<br>
know, at the peak of every 11-year sunspot cycle -- like clockwork.
<br>
<p>Earth's magnetic field also flips, but with less regularity. Consecutive
<br>
reversals are spaced 5 thousand years to 50 million years apart. The last
<br>
reversal happened 740,000 years ago. Some researchers think our planet is
<br>
overdue for another one, but nobody knows exactly when the next reversal
<br>
might occur.
<br>
<p>Although solar and terrestrial magnetic fields behave differently, they do
<br>
have something in common: their shape. During solar minimum the Sun's field,
<br>
like Earth's, resembles that of an iron bar magnet, with great closed loops
<br>
near the equator and open field lines near the poles. Scientists call such a
<br>
field a &quot;dipole.&quot; The Sun's dipolar field is about as strong as a
<br>
refrigerator magnet, or 50 gauss (a unit of magnetic intensity). Earth's
<br>
magnetic field is 100 times weaker.
<br>
<p>When solar maximum arrives and sunspots pepper the face of the Sun, our
<br>
star's magnetic field begins to change. Sunspots are places where intense
<br>
magnetic loops -- hundreds of times stronger than the ambient dipole field
<br>
- -- poke through the photosphere.
<br>
<p>&quot;Meridional flows on the Sun's surface carry magnetic fields from
<br>
mid-latitude sunspots to the Sun's poles,&quot; explains Hathaway. &quot;The poles end
<br>
up flipping because these flows transport south-pointing magnetic flux to
<br>
the north magnetic pole, and north-pointing flux to the south magnetic
<br>
pole.&quot; The dipole field steadily weakens as oppositely-directed flux
<br>
accumulates at the Sun's poles until, at the height of solar maximum, the
<br>
magnetic poles change polarity and begin to grow in a new direction.
<br>
<p>Hathaway noticed the latest polar reversal in a &quot;magnetic butterfly
<br>
diagram.&quot; Using data collected by astronomers at the U.S. National Solar
<br>
Observatory on Kitt Peak, he plotted the Sun's average magnetic field, day
<br>
by day, as a function of solar latitude and time from 1975 through the
<br>
present. The result is a sort of strip chart recording that reveals evolving
<br>
magnetic patterns on the Sun's surface. &quot;We call it a butterfly diagram,&quot; he
<br>
says, &quot;because sunspots make a pattern in this plot that looks like the
<br>
wings of a butterfly.&quot;
<br>
<p>The ongoing changes are not confined to the space immediately around our
<br>
star, Hathaway added. The Sun's magnetic field envelops the entire solar
<br>
system in a bubble that scientists call the &quot;heliosphere.&quot; The heliosphere
<br>
extends 50 to 100 astronomical units (AU) beyond the orbit of Pluto. Inside
<br>
it is the solar system -- outside is interstellar space.
<br>
<p>&quot;Changes in the Sun's magnetic field are carried outward through the
<br>
heliosphere by the solar wind,&quot; explains Steve Suess, another solar
<br>
physicist at the Marshall Space Flight Center. &quot;It takes about a year for
<br>
disturbances to propagate all the way from the Sun to the outer bounds of
<br>
the heliosphere.&quot;
<br>
<p>Because the Sun rotates (once every 27 days) solar magnetic fields corkscrew
<br>
outwards in the shape of an Archimedian spiral. Far above the poles the
<br>
magnetic fields twist around like a child's Slinky toy.
<br>
<p>Because of all the twists and turns, &quot;the impact of the field reversal on
<br>
the heliosphere is complicated,&quot; says Hathaway. Sunspots are sources of
<br>
intense magnetic knots that spiral outwards even as the dipole field
<br>
vanishes. The heliosphere doesn't simply wink out of existence when the
<br>
poles flip -- there are plenty of complex magnetic structures to fill the
<br>
void.
<br>
<p>Or so the theory goes.... Researchers have never seen the magnetic flip
<br>
happen from the best possible point of view -- that is, from the top down.
<br>
<p>But now, the unique Ulysses spacecraft may give scientists a reality check.
<br>
Ulysses, an international joint venture of the European Space Agency and
<br>
NASA, was launched in 1990 to observe the solar system from very high solar
<br>
latitudes. Every six years the spacecraft flies 2.2 AU over the Sun's poles.
<br>
No other probe travels so far above the orbital plane of the planets.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ulysses just passed under the Sun's south pole,&quot; says Suess, a mission
<br>
co-Investigator. &quot;Now it will loop back and fly over the north pole in the
<br>
fall.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the most important part of our mission,&quot; he says. Ulysses last flew
<br>
over the Sun's poles in 1994 and 1996, during solar minimum, and the craft
<br>
made several important discoveries about cosmic rays, the solar wind, and
<br>
more. &quot;Now we get to see the Sun's poles during the other extreme: Solar
<br>
Max. Our data will cover a complete solar cycle.&quot;
