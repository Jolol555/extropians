</em><br>
<em>&gt; No; not immediate at all.  It typically takes years to recognize a bad

loan.
<br>
<em>&gt; Because of this, banks don't &quot;count&quot; profits right away either (really,

they
<br>

</em><br>
<p>You are only looking one thing: loans.  When I parenthetically mentioned
<br>
reserves in the quoted statement, I meant it.:)  A bank that sets its
<br>
interest rates too low would notice a net drain in reserves.  If it sets it
<br>
too high, it would notice a net inflow of reserves.  (This is regardless of
<br>
the reserve used.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Partly due to this, and partly due to psychology, banks have a nasty &quot;herd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentality&quot;.  If you look at banking, on a gold standard, prior to central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banks, you still see wild volatility.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on where you look and the mitigating factors.  The main historical
<br>
example of free banking is Scotland prior to 1844.  There are others, but
<br>
that's when and where the banking system approached free banking to a high
<br>
degree.
<br>
<p>In American banks, there were certain limits placed on the banks before the
<br>
Federal Reserve System.  Many of these limits were placed by states and they
<br>
included requiring the banks to hold a certain amount of state bonds
<br>
(thereby monetizing government debt), branch banking (disallowing banks to
<br>
network and spread offices between regions), portfolio requirements (what
<br>
banks could invest in), minimum capitalization requirements (how much money
<br>
one needs to start a bank), reserve requirements (how much reserves a bank
<br>
must have on hand) and limits of interest rates (usury laws; probably didn't
<br>
have as big an impact).
<br>
<p>Commonsensically, such limits would lead to lower levels of performance.
<br>
Limits on branch banking and portfolio requirements alone would lead to a
<br>
less robust system because this would fragment the banking system.  How so?
<br>
The former would make it hard for an experienced, big bank to move into
<br>
certain regions, meaning only inexperienced or small banks would be in that
<br>
region.  Each new market would have to develop its own banks, not leveraging
<br>
experience or capitalization from other markets.
<br>
<p>Portfolio requirements, especially the holding of state bonds, limit
<br>
diversification and directly intrude into business decisions.  (In Scottish
<br>
free banking period, banks were pretty much the same in relation to the
<br>
government as any other business and faced almost no special regulations.)
<br>
If a bank was required to have a percentage of its investments in a certain
<br>
area -- say, shipbuilding -- and that area was unstable, this would directly
<br>
lead to instability in the bank, no?
<br>
<p>Reserve requirements would make holding reserves independent of the demand
<br>
for money.  Banks not allowed to adjust the amount of their money in
<br>
circulation and their reserves would find it impossible not to inflate or
<br>
deflate.  It would be hard to believe a legal requirement, set by a state
<br>
legislature would somehow get it right until the next time that body met and
<br>
changed the requirement.  This would make it harder for banks to be
<br>
flexible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It isn't immediately obvious whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free-market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or relatively apolitical central banking will generate the &quot;better&quot;
</em><br>
result.
<br>
<p>I guess the Great Depression and the myriad inflations and hyperinflations
<br>
are not evidence enough?
<br>
<p>The current period is only stable in the sense that banks are very highly
<br>
regulated meaning they have little latitude for free action meaning they
<br>
pretty much act the same.  This is not the kind of flexible, dynamic
<br>
stability a free banking system would deliver.
<br>
<p>You have not responded to any of the stuff I've cited...
<br>
<p>Cheers!
