(No hope, Jim...)

<p>From: Jim Fehlinger (<a href="mailto:fehlinger@home.com?Subject=re:Skating%20on%20thin%20ice:%20any%20hope%20of%20resurrecting%20the%20first%20five%20years?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200105111039.MAA18788@galileo.mpi-hd.mpg.de&gt;">fehlinger@home.com</a>),Thu May 10 2001

<p><em>&gt;Yes, I gather that there was a certain atmosphere of paranoia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in those days (perhaps not surprising, since Perry Metzger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is extremely interested in cryptography).
</em><br>
<p>&quot;paranoia&quot; is a bit strong word though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It seems that feeling about the 1991-1995 privacy agreement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still runs strong. I wonder if early posts could be cleared 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by **content** -- e.g., excluding discussions of cryptography 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and other sensitive (potentially incriminating) topics? 
</em><br>
<p>Too large of a task, too sensitive. I think that I probably violated
<br>
it with my extropians light-bulbs jokes renewal from last year and the
<br>
Reputations listing (for which I apologize, if I stepped on anyone's
<br>
toes). I have my own private archive (saved what I thought was most
<br>
valuable to me) of the extropians list from that time.
<br>
<p>BTW, the person that you may have the hardest time is with Tim May,
<br>
more than Perry.
<br>
<p>The list atmosphere at that time was the way that it was because it
<br>
was a private, closed list: that atmosphere fostered the intensity of
<br>
the low-noise discussions. People felt secure that discussions on any
<br>
topic, (for example, all aspects of social communities, cryptography,
<br>
chemical substances, etc. etc) could be made without repercussions
<br>
from the outside. I sincerely doubt that some of those discussions
<br>
would have occurred if folks thought their words would be open to the
<br>
world to read 10 years later. (I know that *I* would have posted
<br>
with different writing style, different topics, if I had thought
<br>
my old words would be public.)
