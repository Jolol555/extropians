<p>
Hi there all,
<br>
<p>Through some strange confluence of events, it seems that I am to appear on
<br>
my current favourite tv program, Aftershock (Australia, ABC, Thursdays
<br>
8:30pm). I'm on relatively late in the series (episode 6, the next episode
<br>
is episode 3), so all I can imagine is that they used up all their quality
<br>
guests (like Damien &quot;btw have you heard about The Spike?&quot; Broderick) early
<br>
on :-). The filming is on 22 May.
<br>
<p>The episode is entitled &quot;Superhumanity 2.0 - Cyborgs&quot; (it follows
<br>
&quot;Superhumanity 1.0 - Biotech&quot;). I can talk about that in a pretty general
<br>
sense (I could probably talk all day about it, in fact, family members will
<br>
corroborate this). However, as I've been picked on as Aussie Extropian
<br>
Exhibit A, I'd be happy to represent a more rounded view, informed by others
<br>
onlist.
<br>
<p>So, I'm throwing it open to the peanut gallery. If you were to talk publicly
<br>
about cyborged humans in the nearish future, what would you say?
<br>
<p>I've got a random assortment of ideas...
<br>
- Wearables... it might be a bit daggy to mention them, but wearable
<br>
computing will be big way before cyborg stuff comes into it's own. It'll be
<br>
a proof of concept in many cases... will people take up the closer
<br>
relationship with their machines, or is the idea of the cyborg flawed in the
<br>
same way as a the video phone or the flying car?
<br>
<p>- Killer app 1: Life extension... This application will really pull &quot;cyborg
<br>
technology&quot; into mainstream culture. Already, there are artificial limbs and
<br>
joints, pacemakers, cochlear implants... I think there are even implanted
<br>
insulin feeds for diabetics (better check that one). People seem happy with
<br>
the deathist meme in a general sense, but often tend to speak differently
<br>
when things start looking grim on a personal scale. Contrary to the normal
<br>
pattern of social change, I would expect strong cyborg uptake to begin in
<br>
the older generations, as it becomes available and shows itself to be
<br>
superior to what these people possess naturally. Younger people, on the
<br>
other hand, will likely resist implants/modifications related to life
<br>
extension.
<br>
You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous,
<br>
who delve into these areas... HRT is a great example. These people will not
<br>
label themselves Transhumanists (despite my taunting to come out of the
<br>
closet), they will continue to raise the deathist business about death being
<br>
part of life and all that great stuff. They also will continue to seek
<br>
treatment for things which might kill them, and which are only newly coming
<br>
to be regarded as pathologies. Such as menopause.
<br>
An interesting factor here is that there is, implicit in much modern,
<br>
mainstream medicine, and in it's life extension techniques, the ideal human
<br>
state of &quot;wellness&quot; (similar and related to the beauty industry's ideal
<br>
form, discussed below). The ultimately healthy body is not only free of
<br>
disease, mobile and resilient, it is youthful. Life extension in this
<br>
context is about maintaining this idealised state indefinitely.
<br>
Incidentally, I feel that transhumanism would not take such a simplistic
<br>
stance on life extension... to us, it is all about freedom of choice, not
<br>
pursuit of a mass marketted ideal.
<br>
But I have digressed. The point of the above is that there is an abstract
<br>
ideal state which informs the search for extended life and youth in
<br>
mainstream culture, and that model will continue to dominate, rather than
<br>
our prefered &quot;freedom of choice&quot; model. The ramifications of this in the
<br>
context of improving technologies will be a shifting of the ideal,
<br>
eventually into territory that only a cyborg can enter. At some point in the
<br>
future, I have no doubt that normal, unaugmented humans will be seen as
<br>
physically ill/disabled individuals, in need of special help and in need of
<br>
treatment. I don't think it's a particularly good thing, but it is likely.
<br>
<p>- Killer app 2: Net connection... In the world of today and tomorrow, the
<br>
greatest change from the past is the existence, and increasing dependency
<br>
upon, interconnection with the rest of the world. Our wearables now (mobile
<br>
phones, pdas. etc etc) are a testament to this... I don't think it's a trend
<br>
which is about to falter any time soon. True wearable computing will take
<br>
off, and the push after that will be to get &quot;cyborg&quot; enhancements to make
<br>
communication even easier... headup displays directly on the retina,
<br>
microphones implants (in/near the jawbone?) to pickup speech, speakers
<br>
inside the ear. Before VR environments (or perhaps in parallel with them) we
<br>
will introduce a whole noisy world of input as close to our external senses
<br>
as possible, and we will simplify output to the maximum extent possible,
<br>
even without direct neural interface. I would then predict that we'd try to
<br>
move directly to neural interfacing, although I'll temper that by saying
<br>
that this will not be the be-all and end-all. I think we'll continue to use
<br>
our external language abilities for a good while yet, basically because any
<br>
kind of direct mind-to-mind interfacing would be incredibly intimate, and
<br>
not the kind of thing you'd want to use to communicate with anyone with whom
<br>
you would not freely make love. Oddly enough, it might also be acceptable to
<br>
communicate with external machines that way too.
<br>
This type of enhancement is one that I would expect younger people to adopt
<br>
first. It will be driven primary by social and economic competitive
<br>
advantage... to have access to these technologies will give you an edge
<br>
those who don't have them. More correctly, as is the case with commercial
<br>
information technology adoption now, using these technologies will be like a
<br>
pre-requisite... you wont gain much by using them (because most others will
<br>
have access to the same stuff), but you will be at a serious disadvantage if
<br>
you do not.
<br>
A strong implication of the drivers of this branch of cyborg tech, is that
<br>
it may well be at odds with the life-extension application. In some cases,
<br>
undoubtedly people will be faced with the choice of enhancements which give
<br>
them short term advantage, but cause them longer term trouble. Some people
<br>
will choose these enhancements. The bar will be raised higher...
<br>
Another implication is related to that of life extension... that it will
<br>
become non-competitive to remain an unaltered human. From the angle of the
<br>
competitive edge in a fast moving society, there is no ideal to be reached;
<br>
it's more like trying to be out the front of the pack in a marathon, or at
<br>
least not falling behind. Very interesting things should come from
<br>
competition driven cyborg technologies, because diversity will be important;
<br>
you never know where the next edge will come from. But, it will be a lot
<br>
more difficult to maintain even the illusion of control over where these
<br>
technologies go. We probably need to get past the desire to control them
<br>
pretty soon, or learn to live with dissapointment.
<br>
<p>Killer app 3: Eternal youth and the beauty industry... Somewhat related to
<br>
life extension, the quest for physical youth and beauty will be a very
<br>
strong driver of cyborg type technologies. It is easy to dismiss this area,
<br>
because it seems somewhat superficial, but when you look at the amount of
<br>
money that flows through the (well manicured) hands of the beauty industry,
<br>
a different picture emerges. Our cultures pathologise aging, and they
<br>
pathologise the marks of aging. Implicit in all this is a model of
<br>
&quot;perfection&quot; which we should all be trying to reach. I am not sure exactly
<br>
what form it takes... Brad Pitt/Nicole Kidman? Whatever the exact form is,
<br>
it apparently doesn't have wrinkles, cellulite or body hair. It can, on the
<br>
other hand, have breast implants, a face lift or a nose job.
<br>
There will be a strong overlap between life extension technologies and
<br>
beauty related technologies. One way to look physically young and fit is to
<br>
stay physically young and fit, after all. Who knows... in the far flung
<br>
future, those anti-wrinkle creams might actually work! They might even work
<br>
by keeping you physically young enough to not have wrinkles. Of course, acne
<br>
could be a problem.
<br>
On the other hand, beauty related technologies have more in common with the
<br>
&quot;competitive edge&quot; camp... they have much to do with gaining ground in one's
<br>
dealings with others, rather than the more internally motivated goal of a
<br>
prolonged life. Techniques down the ages (lead face powder, corsets, stomach
<br>
stapling, modern dieting) show pretty clearly that beauty and health can run
<br>
sharply at odds with one another.
<br>
Another point about the beauty industry is that its ideals are, for all
<br>
intents and purposes, unobtainable. Do what you will, you wont look like
<br>
Elle McPherson with today's technology and treatments, unless you are Elle
<br>
McPherson. However, the beauty industry will have a good go at telling you
<br>
that it can get you close. The unobtainable ideal means endless consumption
<br>
of products.
<br>
So, as our technology for self modification improves, and we can more easily
<br>
hit the mark, the beauty industry will move the target. There are some great
<br>
stats out there (The Beauty Myth contains some decent research) to show that
<br>
the &quot;ideal woman&quot;, for example, is a physically impossible being already.
<br>
When we add cyborg technology to the mix, where will the collective ideal of
<br>
the perfect form move to? Somewhere as odd as it is extreme, and it will
<br>
motivate ever larger uptake of the sillier forms of cyborg technology.
<br>
<p>- Physical enhancements... In the cyberpunk literature, people tend to make
<br>
very silly modifications, so that they can look freaky, or have some
<br>
enhanced physical trait. Steve Austin, eat your heart out. However, I
<br>
believe that these will be the very last types of enhancements that are
<br>
made, and the least frequent. In the world of today, and certainly in that
<br>
of tomorrow, physical enhancements are and become less useful than one might
<br>
suppose. Leap tall buildings in a single bound? Sure... but why not just
<br>
take the lift? It might not turn out to be very important to a modern
<br>
westerner to be able to lift a small truck; it might be far more useful to
<br>
merely look as though you could.
<br>
Eventually physical enhancements will become more important, as our biology
<br>
begins to really let us down... we may need to change form to cope with
<br>
overcrowding of earth, we'll definitely need to change form to explore
<br>
space. That, however, is some way off.
<br>
<p>- Part robot... intertwined with our cyborg advances, will come advances in
<br>
biotech, nanotech, AI (in the loosest sense), and information and
<br>
communication technologies. So, it is likely that we will have some pretty
<br>
smart computers kicking around, grown out of the needs of the biotech
<br>
revolution first, then whatever follows. These will use sophisticated models
<br>
born of that revolution's discoveries. Evolved software, which adapts to a
<br>
changing enironment in real time, will be the bedrock of such systems. We'll
<br>
be pushing close, perhaps, to machines that do something vaguely resembling
<br>
thought. Certainly, they'll make this look like the stone age.
<br>
So, in terms of human enhancement, we are likely to see some very smart
<br>
control systems finding their way into, or close to, people. Tasks which
<br>
take manual dexterity, such as driving a car, should move to become a
<br>
partnership between human and machine, with the machine taking over the
<br>
simpler tasks which require instaneous reaction based on multiple inputs,
<br>
and the humans keeping a high level control. It's human as captain, computer
<br>
as first mate, robots for crew.
<br>
And what is the ship? It could be a car, which can virtually, if not
<br>
absolutely, drive itself. It might be a factory, which just requires a few
<br>
humans to make directorial pronouncements (more blue in the blue m&amp;ms
<br>
please), and can otherwise manage on it's own (hmm, I think this might
<br>
alread be happening). It might be a spacecraft whose sensory abilities are
<br>
translated into human equivalent sensory signals, and whose directions come
<br>
directly from a that human controller's nervous control signals (my fuel
<br>
intake valve feels a bit sticky, I'll wiggle it a bit).
<br>
<p>- Part virtual robot... And some of us will end up descending (ascending?)
<br>
entirely into the virtual realm, with the software equivalents of cyborg
<br>
enhancements... intelligent agents scooting around doing our bidding (most
<br>
likely communicating with even more intelligent server based systems),
<br>
alerting systems and autonomous systems for acting on our behalf, giving the
<br>
as yet nu-enhanced human mind a function performance boost, and the ability
<br>
to move freely in a new environment for which it has not been evolved.
<br>
<p>- Security... People often raise the spectre of personal vulnerability in an
<br>
interconnected world. No one wants to find their robot arm suddenly writing
<br>
&quot;0wned by Kr4XX0r 133t&quot;, or that, after installing some IBM human memory
<br>
expansion, they inexpicably foul themselves whenever they think about
<br>
Microsoft products. In response to this, I would say that we have already
<br>
begun on the path to extreme global interconnectedness, and are painfully
<br>
aware of these issues because of problems we've already experienced.
<br>
However, we must not forget that the world has gone on. Most of us choose to
<br>
remain connected despite the risk, because we perceive it to be far smaller
<br>
that the gain. Yes, we'll continue to have mellissa and I love you viruses
<br>
and internet worms. We'll continue to have script kiddies and black hat
<br>
hackers and international bad guys and, sometimes, catastrophes based on
<br>
pure incompetence. Slowly we get better at coping with these problems. We
<br>
will, through a combination of local intelligent design and global natural
<br>
selection, come to be more and more skilled at keeping the computer network
<br>
a safe enough place, such that, by the time people are putting their bowels
<br>
online, it'll be safe enough to do so.
<br>
<p>- Lastly, I think this discussion can get a bit silly, and will look
<br>
hopelessly naive from the perspective of the people of 50 years from now,
<br>
let alone 100. It'll look something like predicting steam-powered zeppelins
<br>
as the next big thing. There are so many different technological avenue down
<br>
which to progress, and the interaction between these, combined with a few
<br>
completely-out-of-left-field surprises, will take us somewhere mostly
<br>
obscured from here. Personally, I suspect that the mainstream culture's
<br>
&quot;cyborg&quot; is probably another flying car/videophone, and whilst it embodies
<br>
more useful concepts perhaps than those two others, in itself it will go
<br>
obsolete and embarrassing before it becomes reality.
<br>
However, I think that the cyborg memeset is useful at least for a while, and
<br>
I agree with Anders that the tendency to throw our hands up and say &quot;We
<br>
can't know&quot; is counterproductive. Babbage could see the computer, daVinci
<br>
could see human flight, Jules Verne could see space travel. We can see
<br>
transhumanity.
<br>
<p>This whole discussion of mine probably looks hopelessly ill-informed to many
<br>
of you... so tell me why. What's important that I've missed? Where am I
<br>
wrong? Where is my presentation flawed? Don't quietly grumble about it to
<br>
yourself... if you can correct my misinformation, then I'm less likely to
<br>
say something problematic on the box.
<br>
<p>Thanks in advance,
<br>
Emlyn
