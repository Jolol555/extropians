<p><em>&gt; I was approached two times recently. First by a journalist writing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Rael cult and seemed to think that they are transhumanists. The second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach was by a Swedish journalist asking for references of transhumans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Sweden. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather than blindly giving out names of extropians or other transhumanists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a practice I try to do some due diligence on the person/group contacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.  This second contact, again, had a Raelina undertone.
</em><br>
<p>It seems the same journalist has been trying to contact me too. I'm
<br>
not certain I want to be in contact with him; transhumanism can do
<br>
well without being associated with an ufo cult.
<br>
<p>I really wonder why we see so much of the Raelians here in
<br>
Sweden. Must be some chronic lack of critical thinking, a bit like how
<br>
the government gave Milosevic political asylum today after his escape
<br>
- a completely irrational action given their previous action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Can we afford that they are visible and we are not?&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are visible, and becoming more visible yearly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Raelians have recently received press because of their interests in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning, etc.  Being a religious organization (a cult) makes them appear to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more of an organization than a group of individuals who share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical and ideological views.
</em><br>
<p>As soon as some group label themselves or get labelled, it is so much
<br>
easier to chunk them into a collective. Dangerous, but sometimes good
<br>
PR.
<br>
<p>The main difference between the Raelians and us seem to be their lack
<br>
of questioning of their beliefs; transhumanism without critical thinking. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; By the way, if extropians are not visible in Sweden, then let's find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why.  
</em><br>
<p>Actually, extropians were mentioned several years ago in the writings
<br>
of Christer Sturmark, a Swedish IT journalist/pundit. He simply
<br>
regarded extropianism as some kind of new age religion, and I had an
<br>
letter exchange with him in a journal. But extropianism per se is not
<br>
widely known. The closest thing are of course us in the Swedish
<br>
transhumanist association.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Can we afford that they are visible?&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We certainly can afford to be cautious.  We can also afford to continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibly discussing extropian/transhumanist ideas and providing reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to the public.  This is our best defense - actively providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable, reliable information.
</em><br>
<p>Transhumanism definitely need this. In many ways the time is right -
<br>
this is the window of opportunity, our ideas are becoming accessible
<br>
and possible to think about even in the mainstream, and there is a
<br>
real interest. At the same time we might miss it if we are not active
<br>
and provide the reasonable discourse. It is no longer an issue of
<br>
convincing people that nanotech is possible - that has to a large
<br>
extent been done to the groups that matter - now we need to convince
<br>
them that it can be beneficial and useful, as well as discuss the
<br>
social, cultural and economic consequences on a high level.
