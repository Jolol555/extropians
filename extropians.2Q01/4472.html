<p>Life in general is tough, and we're especially tough because we use

technology as our adaptable interface. The technology is dangerous, but
<br>
luckily to become really dangerous you need evil intent, and the
<br>
properties pathological, smart and big $$$s are truly rare.
<br>
<p>Unless you design something deliberately, putting considerable (money,
<br>
people, hardware) investments towards deliberately completely evil intent
<br>
it's hard to take us all out.

<p><em>&gt; I understand people here are a *bit* biased in favour of tech, but

<p>Some of us monkeys are thinking about how to prevent stupid or
<br>
deliberately evil monkeys to depopulate this particular Gibraltar rock.
<br>
You can use technology to insulate from impacts of technology. For
<br>
instance, the same technologies which have been invented to make canned
<br>
monkeys live off-rock sustainably, to keep them healthy, and to survive
<br>
attacks by other monkeys can be used to shield us from above malicious
<br>
and bumbling intent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think you are alone in this idea, although I am yet to be convinced

<em>&gt; Well, basically, I think some bio-weapon will get loose and do us in,
</em><br>

<p>Most current bioweapons can only take out something like 80% in best case.
<br>
You need several of the delayed-kill ones released stealthily ubiquitously
<br>
simultaneously. That's a rather specific point in parameter space. You
<br>
can't hit it by mistake, you have design for it.
<br>
<p>The gray goo thing is sufficiently difficult to build, and by that time
<br>
we'll have enough canned monkeys living off-rock so that it won't be the
<br>
end of all of us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My current long-term plans involve somewhere remote and defensible,
</em><br>
<p>A well-stocked (many, many tons of supplies) natural cave or an abandoned
<br>
mine in deep redneck country should do nicely. If no one knows you're
<br>
there, you don't even need to shoot. If you have a delayed (preferably
<br>
fossil) water source you could stay in there for decades. It helps if
<br>
you're naturally hermitish, and can live off books. Most normal people
<br>
would go crazy after just a few weeks.

<p><em>&gt; I'm less pessimistic about some funky physics prac taking out this end

<p>Another reason to work towards Diaspora. Of course, if the problems behind
<br>
your back don't nuke themselves, they're going to overtake you while in
<br>
transit.
