(I'll quickly mention that this was in response to a post of mine requesting
<br>
advice, specifically about how to file our music on mp3.com . I'm still
<br>
stumped... bear in mind that I can't create my own genre, I can only choose
<br>
from what's there...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Emlyn]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goth!!!!! It can't be true - how embarrassing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can anyone suggest something appropriate by way of genre?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Martin]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't personally put The Land Canaan in the &quot;goth&quot; cathegory right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away as it only bears some resemblance (male vocals, the strings and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the melody style) to what characterizes goth music in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion. However, both the music and the song is very much what would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in most countries be filed under &quot;goth&quot; or &quot;darkwave&quot;. It's quite close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bands such as Soil &amp; Eclipse and Dronning Maud Land, and I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself thinking of Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. ;)
</em><br>
<p>I don't know those bands... I lead a sheltered life :-) I'll check them out.
<br>
<p>The Andrew Lloyd Webber link comes up again. I'll come to terms with it yet.
<br>
I've had a few people say it sounds like a musical, and that we ought to
<br>
make a musical out of it. In fact, we embarked on that track in a fairly
<br>
cursory way, then got happily distracted by the birth of our second baby.
<br>
<p>So basically, what it comes down to is that our music is Goth-Lloyd-Webber.
<br>
What do these types of music have in common? They both take themselves way
<br>
too seriously... I'm not sure that I'm happy with the implications of
<br>
that...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The resemblance to Soil and Eclipse is quite striking anyway. I prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your lyrics, the voices are about as good but Soil &amp; Eclipse is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little bit better musically, at least their more recent releases. Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say your music is bad at all. On the contrary, I really like it.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks. I've mentioned the hardware we used before onlist... a bit
<br>
shamefacedly. I'll just say that it wasn't top of the range audio
<br>
hardware...
<br>
<p>On Leaving was recorded over a year ago, sat in the cupboard. Bad me. We're
<br>
working on new material now; we are working with an excellent pianist, and
<br>
are about to go looking for a cellist and perhaps a violinist. Probably a
<br>
name change in the works, too.
<br>
<p>I'm really champing at the bit to do some more recording. On Leaving was
<br>
recorded only a few months after I started classical singing lessons, and
<br>
Jodie was morning sick! Expect a superior effort on future recordings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snipped a lot of interesting stuff about gothdom/death
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, &quot;gothic&quot; (or &quot;alternative&quot;, which doesn't really mean much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these days) would probably be what most people'd call your music, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could always call it &quot;neo-ambient&quot; or something. It is tradition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for bands labeled as &quot;goth&quot; to say &quot;we're not goth!&quot;. ;)
</em><br>
<p>If I same I'm goth, then I'm not, but if I say I'm not, then I am. Oscar the
<br>
Grouch has this kind of problem...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despair. I label my own band Kallisti &quot;experimental rock&quot; and everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else says &quot;oh, your goth band&quot;. ;P
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, if I'd write a review of The Land Canaan, I'd say that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; musically mostly &quot;slow, dark electronics&quot;, vocally &quot;musical&quot; and leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the classification at that. Genres aren't the most important thing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world. I'd concentrate on whether it was good or not, and on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content of the lyrics.
</em><br>
<p>Consider it done :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; /Martin, goth/synth/metal/pop music journalist in Sweden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We owe a great debt to Sweden in our music! We had a music theory teacher,
<br>
Ulle Palmqvist (sorry if that's wrong), for over a year, to whom Jodie owes
<br>
some, and to whom I owe all my musical knowledge (at least that which hasn't
<br>
come from J). We'd still be seeing him if we hadn't moved interstate. We'd
<br>
take a composition to him, he'd sight read 5 hand-scrawled staves, playing
<br>
two or three on the piano and humming another, then say &quot;that's not wrong,
<br>
that's fine, we'll take out the fifth and call it an E13&quot;. Thanks, Ulle, if
<br>
you're out there...
