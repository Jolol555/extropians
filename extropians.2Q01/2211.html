New Economy: Even in Downturn, Sex Still Sells
<br>
<p><p>By JOHN SCHWARTZ
<br>
<p>With the dark clouds of hard times filling the skies, many
<br>
high-technology companies are cutting back and hunkering down. But
<br>
some brave entrepreneurs are continuing to innovate. Take Duocash,
<br>
a New York company that is pursuing one of the fondest longtime
<br>
dreams of technology entrepreneurs and privacy advocates alike:
<br>
anonymous, secure payments over the Internet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;One of the biggest stumbling blocks for such systems so far has
<br>
been to come up with a form of online cash that businesses and
<br>
customers will actually use. Duocash has found a way around the
<br>
problem ó it uses prepaid telephone long-distance cards, a system
<br>
already in widespread use.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And what was the first Web company to sign up with Duocash?
<br>
Entertainment Network Inc., which runs thousands of so-called
<br>
&quot;adult&quot; sites. The company, based in Florida, made headlines a
<br>
couple of years ago by introducing &quot;Voyeur Dorm,&quot; a Web precursor
<br>
to reality television programs like &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Big Brother.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The interest of an adult-entertainment company should come as no
<br>
surprise, according to Bruce Fancher, the vice president for
<br>
marketing at Duocash. &quot;They're always the first,&quot; he said. &quot;This
<br>
industry has led the market in new technologies.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;There aren't many industries that can call themselves
<br>
recession-proof, but pornography companies can make the argument
<br>
more credibly than most. Over all, X-rated Web sites continue to
<br>
grow, according to figures tallied by analysts at Jupiter Media
<br>
Metrix.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The number of individual visitors at such sites grew more than 27
<br>
percent from December 1999 to February this year ó to nearly 28
<br>
million from 22 million. In the same period, retail sites measured
<br>
by Jupiter Media Metrix showed growth of less than half that rate,
<br>
edging up to 55 million from nearly 49 million.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And the adult-content companies have profit margins that their
<br>
owners cheerfully acknowledge are obscene. Though not being too
<br>
specific, Gerard Vanderleun, director of the online site for
<br>
Penthouse magazine and vice president for Internet ventures at the
<br>
parent company, General Media, says that the Web sites' profit
<br>
margins &quot;would be well above 50 percent and well below 200
<br>
percent.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Or, as Entertainment Network's founder, David Marshlack, put it,
<br>
&quot;It's almost like I owned a bank and was printing my own money.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;One reason the online fleshpots can weather recession is that they
<br>
don't depend on income from what has become one of the biggest
<br>
problem areas for other kinds of sites. &quot;We don't rely on
<br>
advertising,&quot; said Bill Asher, who heads the Vivid Entertainment
<br>
Group, a company that produces X- rated videos and owns a cable
<br>
channel and Web sites. Like many of the adult-content producers,
<br>
Vivid Entertainment's Web sites charge a subscription fee.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Of course, no company is totally immune to the business cycle, Mr.
<br>
Vanderleun of General Media acknowledged. &quot;We're still making
<br>
profits,&quot; he said, &quot;but it's not what it used to be.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The 45 percent growth curve the sites enjoyed in 1999, he said,
<br>
look &quot;more like a 25 percent curve today.&quot; That has led to General
<br>
Media's version of belt tightening.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;We're not laying off anyone, but it's not as easy for me to get
<br>
authorization to hire two more people,&quot; Mr. Vanderleun said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The reason for the slowdown, Mr. Vanderleun suggests, is the
<br>
decline of the kind of extravagance that marked the last few years.
<br>
Web surfers who thought nothing of having high-speed Internet
<br>
connections, which make the photograph-rich pornography sites more
<br>
attractive, are harder to find. Now consumers are paying more
<br>
attention to their budgets, and that sometimes means going back to
<br>
less expensive, plain old telephone modem connections ó and those
<br>
people &quot;don't look at a $20-to-$25-a-month Web site as something
<br>
they can afford anymore.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;He said his company had recently introduced $10, two-day
<br>
memberships to meet the new realities of a tougher marketplace.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The adult companies are also profiting from the misfortunes of
<br>
other Internet concerns, said Mr. Asher of Vivid Entertainment. He
<br>
said he had noticed the greatest change when it came to hiring
<br>
technical talent.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Now it's easier to afford the Internet guys,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't
<br>
have to pay some 27- year-old $250,000 to get him to talk to me.
<br>
You had to have a basketball court in their office and a Ping-Pong
<br>
table to keep them.&quot; The company is taking advantage of the
<br>
economic lull and the bumper crop of available technical talent to
<br>
begin digitizing its archive of movies and prepare for the next
<br>
generation of high-speed Internet delivery, when customers will
<br>
want to download and view whole films.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Mr. Marshlack, meanwhile, has expanded Entertainment Network
<br>
beyond naked men and women to include other ventures. One is
<br>
askoj.com, the site formed to allow people to pay for the privilege
<br>
of communicating with O. J. Simpson. Another is Second Stroke, a
<br>
site that sells used golf balls.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But Mr. Marshlack said that there was something special about
<br>
pornography, a business he compared to the bar he used to own.
<br>
&quot;During recessions,&quot; he said, &quot;people still drink.&quot; The adult
<br>
entertainment business, he added, provides the kind of cash flow
<br>
that lets him operate nimbly and without debt.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Meanwhile, innovations like the Duocash deal help address credit
<br>
card fraud, the biggest problem facing pornography sites. The
<br>
industry has a high percentage of &quot;chargebacks,&quot; or cancellations
<br>
by credit card holders who claim that they did not authorize a
<br>
purchase. In many cases, site owners complain, the credit card
<br>
holder did in fact use his own credit card on a late-night
<br>
pornography cruise but canceled the charge in the remorse of day;
<br>
others cancel when their spouses confront them with the strange
<br>
charges, Mr. Fancher of Duocash said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Duocash estimates that $5.2 billion is currently stored on phone
<br>
cards, which can be bought at kiosks, in convenience stores and
<br>
elsewhere. Consumers buy the cards and make their long-distance
<br>
calls through an &quot;800&quot; number and then punch in a number found on
<br>
the card. The Duocard system simply requires users to enter the
<br>
same number into a form on the participating Web site, and bills
<br>
the calling-card company.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Duocash, Mr. Fancher said, plans to expand into many markets, not
<br>
just the X-rated one. &quot;We don't want to be the porn card,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But pornography companies, he added, move very quickly. &quot;If it's
<br>
a corporation, you have to go through a committee and the vice
<br>
president and all the usual nonsense,&quot; Mr. Fancher said. &quot;Where
<br>
with these guys, it's `great, let's do it.' &quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And that might partly explain why, even as the new economy
<br>
falters, the nude economy keeps going strong.
