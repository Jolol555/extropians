<em>&gt; As someone who works on gerontology, I must say that the FDA has a useful

<p>As I see it, we want both medical freedom and medical quality. On one
<br>
hand we want to be able to chose whatever treatments we think will
<br>
benefit us - even quite risky or as yet unproven ones. On the other hand
<br>
we also want to have some guarantees of efficacy so we can make rational
<br>
decisions.
<br>
<p>I think FDA and its clones in other countries once started out as a way
<br>
of strengthening the second side. But then the usual government
<br>
monopolism ideas crept in, aided by the sometimes guild mentality of the
<br>
medical profession. The result is the current situation where such
<br>
organisations limit medical freedom.
<br>
<p>The solution is to find a better way of achiving both goals. The fact
<br>
that there is a lot of junk around could be handled by finding more
<br>
efficient forms of consumer information, possibly based on the various
<br>
net enhancement and review board schemes being considered. Instead of
<br>
having a binary (or trinary as in the case of Sweden) registration
<br>
system with a very high and expensive threshold to become registered a
<br>
more fine grained system could be used, where each level would
<br>
correspond to how well the treatment had been tested. This would help
<br>
speed the appearance of new pharmaceuticals too. The downside is of
<br>
course that such a system would demand more from the individual using it
<br>
than just trusting the FDA, but I think the benefits would outweigh the
<br>
problems. ¨
