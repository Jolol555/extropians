I don't have time to respond in detail right now to Lee's message
<br>
on lookup tables and consciousness.  I want to make two quick points
<br>
though:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is now easy and instructive to visualize such &quot;playback&quot; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Life Board.  Rather than the next generation being actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computed, we may simply have an automatic arm reach into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequenced table of gels, each with bright spots in fluorescent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paint, and place the next gel in sequence on the Life Board.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This gives every bit the appearance of a civilization developing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or of an entity having an experience, but in reality has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content.  Indeed, the lights are on, but no one is home.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a good description of the &quot;playback problem&quot; in
<br>
consciousness.  As I wrote earlier, I view it as a harder problem than
<br>
the more basic question of whether a computer can be conscious at all.
<br>
<p>My first point is that among mainstream philosophers of consciousness,
<br>
the general view is that such a machine would not be conscious.
<br>
David Chalmers, Hilary Putman and others have characterized
<br>
the materialist or functionalist claim as being that a machine
<br>
which properly implements a particular program would be conscious.
<br>
They then focus their attention on what &quot;implementation&quot; means.
<br>
It turns out that this is a much slipperier concept than one might at
<br>
first suppose.  Here is quote from one of Chalmers' papers on the topic
<br>
at: <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/computation.html">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/computation.html</a>:
<br>
<p>&quot;Justifying the role of computation requires analysis of implementation,
<br>
the nexus between abstract computations and concrete physical systems. I
<br>
give such an analysis, based on the idea that a system implements a
<br>
computation if the causal structure of the system mirrors the formal
<br>
structure of the computation.&quot;
<br>
<p>The point is, then, that even if we agree that a particular abstract
<br>
program would be conscious if properly implemented, we then are faced
<br>
with the question of whether a particular system implements it.  And the
<br>
criterion which Chalmers lays out is that the implementation must mirror
<br>
the formal structure of the computation.  Generally this means that it
<br>
must deal not only with a particular set of data, but with any possible
<br>
set of data, in the same way that the abstract program would.
<br>
<p>The playback machine does not reach this level of fidelity.  It only
<br>
plays back a single record.  It cannot deal with variations in the
<br>
input, and it does not explore the many possible branches that a real
<br>
implementation would.  So by the analysis which is generally followed
<br>
by philosophers of consciousness, playback machines are not conscious.
<br>
<p>(Note though that this objection does not apply to the huge lookup table,
<br>
as that does represent the full complexity of the abstract program.
<br>
There may be other reasons to doubt the consciousness of the HLT but
<br>
this is not one of them.)
<br>
<p>My second point is general skepticism of the notion that consciousness can
<br>
be localized.  I will speak mostly in terms of spatial localization here,
<br>
but if we come to doubt the meaningfulness of localizing consciousness
<br>
spatially, then perhaps temporal localization will be seen as doubtful
<br>
as well.  In that case the whole question of &quot;is X conscious&quot; can be
<br>
seen as meaningless.
<br>
<p>At first it may seem obvious that consciousness is localized.  Our
<br>
consciousness is clearly a property of our brains (or at least our nervous
<br>
systems) and is therefore confined to our heads (or at least our bodies).
<br>
<p>Okay, but now imagine yourself as a microscopic observer, smaller than a
<br>
neural cell, moving about in someone else's brain.  Where exactly is the
<br>
consciousness?  Is it present within the neurons but absent outside them?
<br>
Is it a field which suffuses the entire brain?  What about the edge
<br>
of the brain, does consciousness end suddenly or does it decay over
<br>
some distance?  Similarly, if consciousness is in a computer, what part
<br>
of the computer?  The CPU?  The power supply?  The memory?
<br>
<p>If consciousness truly has a location, we ought to be able to answer
<br>
these questions.  Yet to me it seems doubtful that they are meaningful.
<br>
We can't see consciousness or measure it in any way.  It's not like
<br>
an electric field or a fluid density.  There is no way to create a
<br>
consciousness meter which we can move around and measure the strength
<br>
of the consciousness field.
<br>
<p>I think much of our perception about the locality of consciousness is an
<br>
illusion caused by the cluster of sense organs in the head.  It is clear
<br>
that if our brains were removed to some distance, but somehow remained
<br>
attached to our bodies via radio transducers on the nerves, we would
<br>
feel no different.  We would still &quot;feel&quot; like our consciousness was in
<br>
our head, even though our brains are in a vat somewhere.
<br>
<p>So I would distrust instinct on this question.  We have to work purely
<br>
on the basis of evidence.  And since there is no way of measuring the
<br>
location of consciousness, I suggest that it is not a meaningful concept.
<br>
Putting x,y,z,t coordinates on consciousness doesn't make sense.
<br>
