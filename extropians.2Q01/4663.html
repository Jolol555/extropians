<p><p>Bugs that eat computers
<br>
<p>Researchers in the Institute for Environmental Science at the
<br>
University of Zurich may have discovered the ultimate computer
<br>
bug. Not this time a fault in software but real microbes that can
<br>
digest redundant circuit boards, gather up the heavy metals -
<br>
such as copper - which have gone into their manufacture and allow
<br>
these metals to be recycled for further use.
<br>
<p>The conventional method of dealing with electronic waste is to
<br>
grind or incinerate the material, once any components that can be
<br>
reused have been removed. This process produces a fine-grained
<br>
dust. Now Dr Helmut Brandl and his colleagues at Zurich have
<br>
found an inexpensive way of recovering metals from the dust for
<br>
reuse.
<br>
<p>Relatively common bacteria, such as Thiobacilli ferroxidans and
<br>
Thiobacilli thiooxidans, are already utilized in mining for the
<br>
extraction of metals such as copper. Both types of bacteria
<br>
acquire their metabolic energy through the oxidation of reduced
<br>
sulphur compounds.
<br>
<p>Dr Brandl believes that heterotrophic bacteria and yeasts could
<br>
be utilized to leach lead, copper and tin from printed circuit
<br>
boards. A sulfolobus-like organism mobilises gallium from
<br>
compound semiconductors. Fungi (such as penicillin) and bacteria
<br>
are capable of growing on electronic waste. The formation of
<br>
inorganic acids (e.g. sulphuric acid) through bacteria and the
<br>
formation of organic acids such as citric acid and gluconic acid
<br>
through fungi, cause dissolution of metals. In addition,
<br>
dissolution of metals can be achieved with oxidation processes
<br>
e.g. iron oxidation with thiobacilli. Fungi, because of the
<br>
organic metabolic products (chelating agent), are able to
<br>
maintain the metals in a dissolved state in a certain range, more
<br>
or less independently of the pH value. Penicillium simplicissimum
<br>
is able to efficiently mobilize many metals (Ni, Pb, Sn, Zn) in a
<br>
single stage procedure.
<br>
<p>This procedure allows metals to be separated completely from the
<br>
electronic waste. It is very simple then to recover the metals
<br>
from the various leaching liquids. In a first step, the biomass
<br>
is removed by filtering. Then, the pH content of the filtrate is
<br>
increased by the addition of caustic soda, which facilitates a
<br>
metal fractionation (sequential precipitation). Aluminium and
<br>
copper in particular can be recovered as hydroxide in this way.
