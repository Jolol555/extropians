<p>How do you resolve issues like these?  Split your efforts between both
<br>
alternatives to maximize output.  How much money is spent on attempts to
<br>
actually ship food directly to the poor?  Lots.  How much money is spent
<br>
on direct efforts to implement the Singularity?  We can both personally
<br>
attest, Ben, that there is not much.
<br>
<p>Literally tens of thousands of times as much money is being spent on
<br>
fighting the battle than on winning the war.  If Total Win R&amp;D were an
<br>
entire 1% of the money spent on Shipping Yet Another Crate of Food, there
<br>
*still* wouldn't be enough money going to Total Win R&amp;D.  The *correct*,
<br>
optimal balance between Total Win R&amp;D and more mundane efforts would
<br>
probably be around the same as the balance between R&amp;D spending and
<br>
day-to-day operational spending at a major technology company.
<br>
<p>Right now, Total Win is nowhere *near* 1%.  Your argument would make sense
<br>
*only* if there were *so much money* being spent on the Singularity that
<br>
the Singularity had reached the point of diminishing returns, while there
<br>
was *so little money* being spent on direct benefits that relatively small
<br>
investments in shipping food directly could have a huge payoff.  But this
<br>
is the exact opposite of the situation that actually obtains.  So little
<br>
money is being spent on the Singularity that not only are we not at the
<br>
Point of Diminishing Returns, we are at the Point of Enormous Leverage. 
<br>
Suggesting that money be diverted from the Singularity (or the Extropy
<br>
Institute) to CARE has to be literally the worst possible way to implement
<br>
philanthropy.  It is not only eating your seed grain, it is deliberately
<br>
searching out and eating the most valuable seed grain on the entire
<br>
planet.
<br>
<p>There is a place in the world for CARE, and a place in the world for ExI. 
<br>
I am not suggesting that CARE be destroyed.  Your suggestion that ExI fund
<br>
CARE, however, makes far less sense than suggesting the reverse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; p.s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bill Gates is spending his money on neither helping the poor NOR on urging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>What on *Earth* are you talking about?
