Dear extropians,
<br>
<p>I'm new on the list, so please don't hesitate with (private or public)
<br>
remarks to make me a better list-member. [BTW, weird to meet here people
<br>
whom I know from <a href="mailto:armchair@gmu.edu?Subject=Re:%20Memetic%20engineering%20against%20irrationality?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20010424020814.A3999@Samaris.tunes.org&gt;">armchair@gmu.edu</a> or comp.lang.forth]
<br>
<p>I've been told that some among you were experts in memetic engineering,
<br>
and I would like to know if you could teach me how to put this science
<br>
in good use to fight the fallacies with which associative thinkers are
<br>
bringing doom on the world and slowing down progress.
<br>
<p>The questions that I wonder about are as follow:
<br>
* since, in democracies, most people seem to follow irrational arguments
<br>
&nbsp;in making important decisions about other people (including us), how can
<br>
&nbsp;we engineer discourse so as to disarm bad memes?
<br>
* It is rather easy to analyse the fallacies that people use,
<br>
&nbsp;and the mental associations that these fallacies are based upon;
<br>
&nbsp;but what about synthetizing anti-fallacies to fight them?
<br>
* are there meta-rational memes the use of which can encourage rationality?
<br>
* are there good models of (human or AI) minds that account for the use
<br>
&nbsp;of below-described rational and irrational thought patterns?
<br>
<p>Below is a rant on irrationality that you may safely ignore;
<br>
it tries to summarize my current experience with discussing
<br>
with irrational people.

<br>
Rant on irrationality
<br>
<p>I've recently tried to analyze the arguments by collectivists, luddites,
<br>
egalitarians, etc., during a number of rational discussions I tried to have
<br>
with them. I found that actually, these people weren't rational at all,
<br>
that their thought mechanism was based on irrational bilateral associative
<br>
process: &quot;concepts&quot; (or rather, targets for emotion) are linked to other by
<br>
symmetric linkers of either attraction or repulse, and gathered into big
<br>
categories. When making a choice, the irrational thinker will thus consider
<br>
the alternatives as opposing categories, and choose to side with whichever
<br>
category he associates his &quot;I&quot; with most strength. On the contrary, a
<br>
rational thinker will use assymmetric linkers between concepts, that express
<br>
directed causal constructs; the resulting structures are thus conceptual
<br>
graphs rather than emotional pools.
<br>
<p>This phenomenon can be observed in that during a tentative rational
<br>
discussion, the irrational people will likely to respond to keywords
<br>
or short expressions, rather than to the overall meaning of a sentence,
<br>
thus often missing the point when a sentence is structured around
<br>
something not reducible to symmetric associations. They will be sensitive
<br>
to each other's &quot;we or them&quot; categorization and similar calls to take sides.
<br>
They develop opinions from a net of emotion-driven contacts, and are prone
<br>
to make blunt assertions on topics they completely ignore, based on
<br>
emotional analogy (e.g. &quot;fascism is an individualistic ideology&quot;, deduced
<br>
from categorizing fascism as evil and collectivism as good).
<br>
Because of their associative thinking system, conversation topics
<br>
will leak and dilute instead of focusing on key arguments. Soon, any
<br>
opinion divergence will reorient toward emotional poles with which the
<br>
irrational thinker identifies most or that he hates most (hence the Godwin
<br>
Law about random usenet discussions eventually involving nazism,
<br>
and thus ending, since there's not much more to be said after having
<br>
associated someone with the category of Ultimate Evil(tm)).
<br>
When faced with a rational analysis of their own fallacies, these
<br>
people will miss the point, both invoking relativism to dismiss their
<br>
opponent's points and absolutism to defend their assumptions.
<br>
<p>If I understand correctly the little brain anatomy I learnt, symmetric
<br>
associative behavior is typical of the &quot;limbic&quot; secondary area of the
<br>
neocortex where emotion and basic memory are said to reside, whereas
<br>
structured thinking is the fruit of the tertiary &quot;associative&quot; areas.
<br>
So this might mean that some of these tertiary areas are underdeveloped,
<br>
or wired in some bad way, or something (I admit I have but a primitive
<br>
model of the mind). Now, there are several reasons that lead me to think
<br>
it's probably more of a software problem than a hardware problem (although
<br>
a software problem in some critical area): firstly, reported pathologies
<br>
are very different from this kind of irrationality, so this must not be
<br>
about atrophy of some organs; second, said irrational people seem to be
<br>
able to acquire many proficiencies that depend on rational mechanisms
<br>
(sometimes even involving higher mathematics or formal logic), so this
<br>
is about selective irrationality, maybe size- and topic- selective with
<br>
respect to the problem set finally, it so happens that rational people
<br>
themselves use the same mechanisms as irrational people as part of their
<br>
own cognitive processes, except that they latter use reason as a filter
<br>
to eliminate fallacious associations, to requalify previous associations,
<br>
etc. The latter long-term requalification, as well as the sequentiality
<br>
involved in short-term filtering of &quot;big&quot; concepts, mean that rationality
<br>
has to do with the ability to dynamically modify the wiring of concepts
<br>
in the limbic memory/evaluation system, depending on new filtering results.
<br>
<p>Often, the internal structure of natural phenomena can be better understood
<br>
by examining their failure patterns when placed in various situations.
<br>
Maybe this rant on irrationality can bring some insight on what rationality
<br>
is, and how an AI can or cannot develop human-like &quot;intelligence&quot;.
<br>
Other side questions include the problem of the relationship between
<br>
rationality and &quot;intelligence&quot;; how much of rationality is inborn, how
<br>
much is acquired; how much rationality does use of human languages involve
<br>
(not much it seems); what's the relationship between rationality and the
<br>
builtin pattern-recognizers that give birth to our geometric, musical, or
<br>
other &quot;intuitions&quot;? 
<br>
<p>Are there books, articles, whatever, on this topic?
<br>
<p>[Something terrible in egalitarian France is that so many irrational people
<br>
are raised, through the schooling system, to titles, diplomas, grades, etc,
<br>
that make them believe they are &quot;intellectuals&quot;, and thus conferred
<br>
authority on questions upon which they have &quot;as much of a right to&quot; an
<br>
opinion as anyone else, like everyone. This matches very well the concept
<br>
of &quot;democracy&quot;, whereby it is number, not reason, that should prevail;
<br>
which gets worse as political power of people (political majorities) over
<br>
other people (minorities) gives weight to emotional decisions that are not
<br>
corrected by the feedback exerted on decision-makers when they are
<br>
responsible for their decisions, and their self-interest leads them
<br>
to make good use of experience.]
