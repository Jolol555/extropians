<em>&gt; &gt; You better get working on coming up with some sane model of a &quot;leftist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism&quot; (for lack of a better word). I have been asking for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for ages - I think there is nothing that has hurt the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism as much as the lack of internal debate over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophical foundations of transhumanism. We need something more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just taking one's normal political stance with transhumanism tacked onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it, we need a true synthesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a philosopher myself it is pleasant to think that this is true. But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder why. Do you mean by a &quot;synthesis&quot; that we ought to be looking for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unifying political philosophy for transhumanism? Why isn't a healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pragmatism here sufficient? For example, why can't liberal, socialist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian, and facist transhumanists be content to work together on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific issues? 
</em><br>
<p>Transhumanism stated roughly as the idea of enhancing the human condition 
<br>
beyond current limitations through rational means does not itself have any 
<br>
values, which makes it rather useless as an ethical or political philosophy 
<br>
without some value system. If is of course possible to take a value system 
<br>
from some political philosophy and combine it with transhumanism, but the 
<br>
result doesn't always make sense - a libertarian transhumanism works well, 
<br>
but a conservative transhumanism develops inconsistencies that makes it 
<br>
rather ridiculous. So clearly not every value system works here, and I think 
<br>
it might be fruitful to explore whether there might be similar fundamental 
<br>
inconsistencies between socialism and transhumanism (or for that matter, 
<br>
between libertarianism and transhumanism). 
<br>
<p>However, just tacking on transhumanism onto whatever you happen to believe 
<br>
politically or ethically (or vice versa, selecting politics and ethics from 
<br>
your transhumanist views) when there is not too much inconsistency might 
<br>
satisfy the human need for consistency but does not base any of this in your 
<br>
view of reality or guarantee any long-term coherence of the system. We need 
<br>
consistency in order to guide our self-transformation process. 
<br>
<p>This is where I think transhumanism (or rather, *a* transhumanism) needs 1) 
<br>
to consider what foundations it is based on, and 2) create a synthesis with a 
<br>
value system that can create a workable and consistent whole. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own view is that the question of whether a transhumanist ethics can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be fashioned is the logically prior question. For all political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies announce or presuppose some theory of human nature. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism raises the question of which nature ought we to have; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in itself an ethical question. 
</em><br>
<p>At the same time, transhumanism does not necessarily deny the existence of 
<br>
any prior human nature.
<br>
<p>Theories of human nature has objective and subjective parts. We can all 
<br>
roughly agree on the objective parts (human are animal organisms, have 
<br>
certain psychological basics etc), while the subjective parts are of course 
<br>
more contentious (are humans &quot;good&quot; or &quot;sinful&quot;? what rights do they have and 
<br>
why etc.). Being a basically empirical and rational view, transhumanism must 
<br>
remain consistent with the objective, testable parts of human nature we can 
<br>
study. Different choices of the subjective parts of theories of human nature 
<br>
will however produce different theories, and I would say this is where an 
<br>
value or ethical system is introduced. 
<br>
<p>Having some form of value system is necessary to direct action, and 
<br>
especially necessary for answering questions about what human natures we 
<br>
ought to have - as well as what changes are allowable. Am I allowed to modify 
<br>
other individuals minds to embrace what I consider true? Is it acceptable to 
<br>
improve myself using any means available? 
<br>
<p>Transhumanism as a practical philosophy useful for living a good life must be 
<br>
able to give at least tentative answers to these questions. Hence it would 
<br>
ideally be based on a theory of human nature (which in its transhuman 
<br>
perspective would of course be a malleable concept but likely with a few 
<br>
invariants assumed to be inviolable, essential or at least defining), giving 
<br>
rise to an ethics that drives transhuman action and a consistent politics. 
<br>
<p>In practice we tend to develop our personal philosophies in a far more 
<br>
haphazard manner, but that doesn't mean there is no benefit in refining and 
<br>
developing them towards this kind of consistent views. The more our views 
<br>
hang together, the easier it is to act when it is virtuous and avoid acting 
<br>
when it would be bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not that optimistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the possibility of a synthesis given that transhumanism is working in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely new ecological space in the intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. (Unless by 'synthesis' we mean aufheben). Part of the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that traditional ethics suffers from a similar limitation as political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy, namely, that all ethical theories presuppose a theory of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature. 
</em><br>
<p>Which means that we will need to develop an ethics that can handle a dynamic 
<br>
human nature. My best guess is that it would be based on acknowledging humans 
<br>
(of whatever form) as processes undergoing constant change due to internal 
<br>
and external factors, and define values from desirable and undesirable states 
<br>
of this process or possibly desirable and undesirable directions of 
<br>
development. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a simple example of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the claim by Kant that &quot;ought implies can&quot;. It is absurd to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that  I ought to allievate all suffering on this earth because I can't. (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can lend a hand, but I can't do it all by myself). What we can and can't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is circumscribed in part by who we are, i.e., in part by our nature. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changing the scope of what we can do, by altering our natures, will likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to an increase in the scope of what we ought to do.
</em><br>
<p>Quite possibly. The ethical obligations of posthumans might be significantly 
<br>
larger than for baseline humans. It is not just that with great power comes 
<br>
great responsibility (and I don't buy the Kant argument), but that being an 
<br>
ethical subject is in itself closely linked to the ability to modify and 
<br>
regulate one's actions, foresee consequences and understand the relationship 
<br>
between oneself and the world. In posthumans these capacities would likely be 
<br>
enhanced, and hence they would have a greater ability to act ethically (which 
<br>
doesn't mean they *will* act ethically).
