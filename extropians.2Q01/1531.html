<p>&lt;&lt; I don't see you as such. As I stated the companies are seeking to
<br>
&nbsp;maximize their bottom lines, I suggest you do whatever is in
<br>
&nbsp;accordance with your values to maximize yours. &gt;&gt;
<br>
There's the rub, Brian. What is in my interest may not be in the long-term 
<br>
interest of my countrymen, or myself. My short-term interest would be to have 
<br>
IT Guilds, which would effectively, choke out competition, and drive 
<br>
inflation in a demand-push style. My own little mafia. I also note that the 
<br>
importers of foreign IT folk are never subject to  'foreign' management 
<br>
teams, competing with them, on their own soil. That ultimately, might be the 
<br>
most satisfying, for me. Sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander. Ah well, 
<br>
consider it demented musings.
