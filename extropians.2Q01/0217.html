Back on 2/25/2001, Jeff Davis wrote in response to the discussion Barbara
<br>
Lamar and I had been having about the uses and abuses of “rhetoric” in the
<br>
cultural and political contest between people seeking progress and those
<br>
opposed to it:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To reclaim the dialectic you must distinguish between the dialectic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion, a fundamentally rational activity, and the dialectic of debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is political action in action.  In the politics of Luddism the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ambitious self-serving political leadership of the Luddite herd seeks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whip it into a frenzy and send it stampeding toward their political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adversaries with the intent of stomping, routing, and scattering them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political defeat.  You won't reclaim the dialectic by reasoned and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temperate discussion with the stampeding herd.  For this dialectic you
</em><br>
need
<br>
<em>&gt;something with (counter-)action potential like loud frightening noises,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;barbed wire, or a stampeding herd of you own, headed on an intercept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course.  And then, you only need such a defensive response if the Luddite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;herd is genuinely dangerous, and not some phantom of media feedback and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exaggeration.  Which is my view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The luddite-lites of today are mere chittering henny-pennies, impressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with their own fierce screeching, and intoxicated with the fantastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;delusion--&quot;the impostume of too much wealth and peace&quot;--that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crusaders on an heroic mission to rescue imperiled Gaia. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Meanwhile, they're out-manned, out-resourced, and out-motivated by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opposition.  Responsible grown-ups, a vast legion of scientists the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over, and even vaster legions of hard-working people made eminently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practical by enforced austerity strive for better living through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology, coping as gently as they can with overprivileged homo hystericus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pedantic waste of bandwidth.  Nevermind.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  As regular readers here will know, I personally consider this
<br>
to be a set of issues of paramount importance to those who would promote
<br>
the transhumanist agenda.  Jeff, you point to two distinct but related questions.
<br>
&nbsp;The first is whether the “neo-luddites” are a real threat to progress or
<br>
are, instead, a “phantom of media feedback and exaggeration.”  The second,
<br>
related question, is the real potential these folks have for influence on
<br>
our future.
<br>
<p>There are two approaches to the first question.  On the one hand, one can
<br>
consider the question as a purely “cultural” one, i.e. we can consider the
<br>
phenomenon of the neo-luddites solely within the context of the words and
<br>
images of culture, in which EVERYTHING is, in a sense, a “phantom of media
<br>
feedback”. In this view, I think we can conclude that they are NOT some
<br>
ephemeral will-o-the-wisp, but have become a real force in their own right
<br>
that is having a significant influence on cultural phenomena beyond the
<br>
confines of their own partisan organizations.  Their leading spokespeople
<br>
get a respectful hearing in the mainstream media and, perhaps as a more
<br>
important measure of their importance, attract significant funding.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, one can ask the more important question: Do the folks who have
<br>
explicitly identified themselves as enemies of technological progress have
<br>
an influence on public policy outside the realm of mere words and ideas?
<br>
&nbsp;Again, I think the answer is clearly yes.  On the one hand, the decidedly
<br>
anti-technology views increasingly expressed in the regulatory regimes of
<br>
the European Union and the Pacific branch of the “Anglosphere” come from
<br>
SOMEWHERE.  On the other, the “anti-globalist” ideology is becoming a more
<br>
and more well-defined political position that I see coming to take the place
<br>
that traditional Marxist ideas and policies played as an attractor for groups
<br>
throughout the world that perceive themselves to be “disenfranchised”, from
<br>
Third World political parties to a wide range of interest groups in the
<br>
First World.  In the 21st Century, a conservative, basically anti-scientific
<br>
and anti-rationalist “naturism” is increasingly taking the place that straightforward
<br>
Marxism played as the leading “alternative ideology” in the 20th Century.
<br>
<p>Assuming this analysis is correct, can we yet gauge the potential influence
<br>
that this new ideology might have on our future?  I think we can definitely
<br>
see real gains by Rifkinite conservatives in the kinds of policies being
<br>
implemented by the European Union toward human genetic engineering and the
<br>
increasing prominence of the term “the precautionary principle” being used
<br>
by a wide front of groups opposed to continued technological progress. 
<br>
The coalition of groups forming behind implementation of “the precautionary
<br>
principle” as a basic tenet of public policy toward research and development
<br>
of new technologies is becoming a more real political force every day. 
<br>
By adopting that term – which suggests a simple, reasonable caution in the
<br>
face of untried technologies – the neo-luddites have seized a significant
<br>
rhetorical advantage that masks the impossibility of ever proving a negative.
<br>
&nbsp;Any lawyer will tell you that the allocation of the burden of proof is
<br>
often “outcome determinative” in any inquiry into disputed facts.  Any trial
<br>
lawyer will tell you that having to prove a negative – especially when the
<br>
burden is cast as, say “beyond a reasonable doubt” – is for all intents
<br>
and purposes a pre-judgment of the facts.
<br>
<p>By injecting “the precautionary principle” into a broad front of public
<br>
debate about technological development, the neo-luddites have stolen a march
<br>
on those who would continue to press forward the program of the Enlightenment.
<br>
&nbsp;In this respect, Rifkin and his ideological kin have done the same sort
<br>
of thing that anti-abortion activists did when they came to characterize
<br>
their views as “pro-life”.  Who can be “anti-life”?  It took a concerted
<br>
effort on the part of proponents of abortion rights to re-cast their views
<br>
as “pro-choice”, a rhetorical move that reformulated the political expression
<br>
of their policies in terms essentially skew to that chosen by their opponents.
<br>
&nbsp;And, just as those choices about rhetorical formulation ended up creating
<br>
a kind of “ideological trench warfare” in which no real “victory” for either
<br>
side was possible, I fear that the same kind of deep entrenchment of views
<br>
lies ahead on the broader front of social policy toward transhumanist technologies.
<br>
<p>I feel there is nothing to be gained by not being quite clear about what
<br>
is at stake and how I foresee that this conflict will develop.  I have become
<br>
convinced that the issues that have been grasped by the anti-globalists
<br>
and neo-luddites will become the defining issues of the cultural, political
<br>
and economic realms in the coming decades and that there is an inevitable
<br>
deep-seated conflict between them and those who endeavor to continue with
<br>
the program of progress through individual liberty, science and technology
<br>
begun in the Enlightenment.  With every new development in genetics, robotics
<br>
and nanotechnology, the cultural and political conflict will become more
<br>
acute.  The conflict cannot be ignored or made to go away by attempts to
<br>
minimize it.
<br>
<p>This is why I believe that attempts to express the basic values of the Enlightenment
<br>
in terms relevant to the kinds of technological power we are developing
<br>
are so important.  This is why I am an extropian.  We MUST develop and promulgate
<br>
a set of values that can serve as a robust guide to action in society with
<br>
regard to the technological progress that is now upon us.  Those who would
<br>
bring such progress to a halt have already begun the work of both ideological
<br>
development and political organization and action.  Failing to respond in
<br>
kind is equivalent to ceding control of the future.
