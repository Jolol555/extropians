<p>
A belated personal note in this thread . . .
<br>
<p>While I certainly agree that modern media have put &quot;moderately gifted&quot; people 
<br>
into direct competition with the most highly gifted and therefore may have 
<br>
blunted the creativity of some, advancing technology has other, offsetting 
<br>
characteristics.  Growing up, I lived in the shadow of my older brother, who 
<br>
always clearly had better hard-wiring for music than I did.  David is a much 
<br>
better &quot;natural musician&quot; than me and I definitely grew away from creating 
<br>
music out of the inability to play on the same level that he did.  For years 
<br>
after we both moved away from our birth family, my native musical talent lay 
<br>
fallow because I didn't have the time to devote to music.  Last year, though, 
<br>
I bought a moderately-priced synthesizer that has proved to be a tool with 
<br>
which what musicality I DO posses could grow again.  Without the set of tools 
<br>
provided by this new technology, I probably would never have returned to 
<br>
making music of any kind.
<br>
<p>The same has been true for graphic art in my life.  As a boy and teenager, I 
<br>
used to draw a LOT.  Again, though, time and the demands of other pursuits 
<br>
resulted in the level of talent I possessed lying fallow for decades in my 
<br>
adult life.  But the development of digital graphics tools has now resulted 
<br>
in providing me with the kind of supporting environment that has allowed me 
<br>
to again express myself graphically.  Because of these tools, I'm now a 
<br>
collaborator with the architect that is working on an addition to our home, 
<br>
rather than a mere consumer of the artistic element of that project.
<br>
<p>A similar phenomenon has happened in the realm of letters.  The Internet has 
<br>
fostered a kind of amateur writing that simply didn't exist before ten years 
<br>
ago.  E-mail lists and newer net media represent a kind of open-ended, 
<br>
world-scale journal of letters in which non-professional writers express 
<br>
themselves and even progress as writers in ways that previous technologies 
<br>
simply didn't make possible.
<br>
<p>The thesis of the original post in this thread is likely correct that 
<br>
moderately gifted people can no longer compete in the *commercial* public 
<br>
expression of artistic or other creative activities.  But technology has also 
<br>
allowed such people to express themselves for purely personal enjoyment and 
<br>
self-fulfillment in ways that weren't previously possible.
