<p>Right, but so was distributed.net. Contrary to distributed.net, they never opened

up to volunteer developers, and their clients remained closed source. Instead of 
<br>
reinventing a wheel, and a triangular one at that, they should have written a yet 
<br>
another distributed.net client, using existing infrastructure. Their clients were 
<br>
buggy. They were entirely nonresponsive both at personal email and website level. 
<br>
They chose to waste a bulk of cycles on Windows clients by painting pretty picture
<br>
instead of crunching. They did not have enough data to crunch, so they started
<br>
forking over the same blocks to different clients. And so on.

<p>They shouldn't have treated their volunteers like cattle. They certainly haven't

<p>A distributed client architecture which processes one GByte a day using millions

is a collossal joke.

<p>I'm not surprised because it integrates seamlessly into SETI@home neat track of

</em><br>
<p>Gee, how very unexpected. Don't you see a problem with that statement of that admin
<br>
friend of yours?
