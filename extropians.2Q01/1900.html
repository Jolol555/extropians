<p>Yes.  That's who I meant when I referred to how he believed
<br>
that &quot;God's Book&quot; contained all, and only, the most elegant
<br>
proofs.  Erdos was always saying &quot;That's in The Book!&quot;
<br>
when shown a really exquisite proof.  I was spoofing when
<br>
I suggested that God's Book, in it's appendix, might also have
<br>
all the true relationships, with an asterisk next to the
<br>
ones that had proofs, (and two asterisks next to the ones
<br>
that could be proved by pre-singularity humans!), no matter
<br>
how ugly the proofs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...if it is unprovable whether there exists infinitely many
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's great!  Whether you are right or not!  It makes my head
<br>
hurt, and that's the purpose of my little story about the
<br>
mathematician at the party, namely as an aid to keeping clear
<br>
what I know about provability and unprovability.
<br>
<p>Let me take a swing:  Okay, so the student says that he
<br>
has a proof that (the existence of infinitely many) is
<br>
unprovable.  So he has a proof (in his trembling fingers)
<br>
that it's unprovable whether there is an upper bound.
<br>
That means that for each integer (beyond the small ones,
<br>
of course) we cannot prove whether or not it is an upper
<br>
bound.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, suppose that his proof proves that for each
<br>
integer N greater than 3^163^641^6969 + 86^86 + 42  you
<br>
can neither prove nor disprove (i.e. such proofs do not
<br>
exist) that N is an upper bound.  Then that would mean
<br>
that any pair greater than that would have to be 
<br>
composite (because we can always, brutally if need be,
<br>
establish whether or not a given number is prime), and
<br>
as you say, that would prove the finitetude of the prime
<br>
pairs.
<br>
<p>It doesn't help any if his paper merely proves that there
<br>
exists some number Z such that you can neither prove nor
<br>
disprove that any number greater than Z is an upper bound.
<br>
Your observation kicks in once more.  The student has been
<br>
unmasked as a charletan.
<br>
<p>But what if his paper just proves that you cannot prove that any
<br>
number greater than 42 is an upper bound?  (Slightly different!)
<br>
Just because we can't prove it, it may nonetheless be the case
<br>
that  3^163^641^6969 + 86^86 + 42 is in fact an upper bound 
<br>
(although we could never possibly learn that).  Then we would
<br>
have to hail the student and his proof after all.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
