<p><em>&gt; I think as long as our educational system keeps working in such a ruinous

way
<br>

</em><br>

on.

</em><br>
I'
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  worried however I seem to be pretty much the exception, judging by how 
</em><br>
most 
<br>
<em>&gt; of 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No but, without meaning to be pessimistic about your own personal plans, I 
<br>
think that single individuals trying to fight the current situation within 
<br>
the framework of current social systems and technologies cannot make any 
<br>
meaningful difference.  It is the classic case of sticking a finger in the 
<br>
dike to try to stop the flood.  The information-transfer rate of traditional 
<br>
educational methods is simply inadequate to the task at hand.  I admire your 
<br>
desire to make a difference, but I think that a realistic assessment is that 
<br>
there are simply too few people of good intentions working against forces 
<br>
that are far too strong to make a significant difference.  For all of my 
<br>
ambivalence about the historical connotations of the word, &quot;revolutionary&quot; 
<br>
action is required.
<br>
<p>The question is, &quot;What revolution?&quot;  The Marxist &quot;Third world liberation&quot; 
<br>
ideology of Guevara and Castro and Subcomandante Marcos is utterly empty.  It 
<br>
is only the insularity of the cultural world of Second and Third world 
<br>
academics and intellectuals that allows this nonsense to continue to 
<br>
propagate.  What is required is a completely new approach to the problems 
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p>Allow me to speculate on what the outlines of a fanciful, but perhaps more 
<br>
fruitful approach might be.  If we in transhumanist and extropian circles are 
<br>
correct, then the possibility of reaching much more directly into the minds 
<br>
of &quot;the masses&quot; in the undeveloped world lies in the not too distant future.  
<br>
I have sketched here before my idea for a technology I call a &quot;brain seed&quot;, a 
<br>
super-cheap, solar-powered satellite information appliance.  Imagine it could 
<br>
be built for $1 per copy.  Getting one into the hands of every human on the 
<br>
planet might cost as little as $30 billion.  This is a large sum, but one 
<br>
that could be born by a world economy that might exist in ten or 20 years.
<br>
<p>Now imagine that &quot;we&quot; (and who that &quot;we&quot; is a more important question than 
<br>
how to build and distribute the &quot;brain seeds&quot;) have planned for the time when 
<br>
these devices begin to disseminate throughout the world.  Imagine that we 
<br>
have created a robust infrastructure of educational tools into which these 
<br>
terminals will automatically connect when they are distributed.
<br>
<p>To me, this &quot;brain seed&quot; scenario might hold the promise of the most 
<br>
revolutionary leap in the human condition in history.  It also presents the 
<br>
potential for the most titanic cultural struggle in history.  What 
<br>
information will these brain seeds access?  Determining the content of the 
<br>
entry-way(s) into the truly global network they would represent would be the 
<br>
greatest challenge our species has ever faced, because it would be the first 
<br>
time that, AS A SPECIES, we would be able to address ourselves.
