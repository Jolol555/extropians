<p>&nbsp;No, it is Paul Hume. I used to run the BBS system on the same network.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A while later (this was about 1990 or so) I was playing a game called
</em><br>
Shadowrun, and
<br>
<em>&gt; was slightly weirded out as to how well written the magical aspects of it
</em><br>
were. Seemed
<br>
<em>&gt; that the people involved had done more than the usual 10 minutes' research
</em><br>
on magical
<br>
<em>&gt; and occult practices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, some time later, I find out that the same Paul Hume wrote Shadowrun.
</em><br>
Small world.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;He only wrote the magical system for the game. He and a friend co-wrote the
<br>
old game &quot;Bushido&quot; as well and were on various other projects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone know what he has done since Shadowrun?  I miss the discussions on
</em><br>
PODS, but I
<br>
<em>&gt; discovered the internet, which of course meant the end of my BBS
</em><br>
activities.  :-)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;He's had a tech career and is active in the Ordo Templi Orientis and
<br>
online. You can readily find him in a few places online, like the Thelema93
<br>
list on yahoo groups. Paul is an old friend of mine.
