<p><em>&gt; Maybe its just my paraoid streak, but with the reports of hoof and mouth

</em><br>
<p>The current wisdom theorises that FMD is viral  in nature. Symptoms of FMD
<br>
in livestock begin usually with a temperature, followed within 24 hours by
<br>
the appearance of blisters and ulcerations on places such as the tongue,
<br>
lips, gums, dental pad, interdigital skin of the feet, bulbs of the heels
<br>
and milk teats. Occasionally, ulcerations appear inside the nostrils or on
<br>
the muzzle.  Visually, these ulcerations are the equivalent of large cold
<br>
sores. The resultant illness and lameness causes decreased appetite, a drop
<br>
in milk yield, a drop in productivity, and of course, increased care costs.
<br>
Afflicted animals almost always recover, usually within a week or two. Death
<br>
occurs in only 5 percent of cases. [UK Times, 1.3.2001]
<br>
<p>I wonder how much evidence there is that hoof and mouth is contageous.  In
<br>
looking into the matter, I checked out Sir Albert Howard, who is credited
<br>
with writing the book that set off the organic farming and gardening
<br>
revolution, An Agricultural Testament, Oxford University Press, 1943. He
<br>
also wrote Farming and Gardening For Health or Disease. Faber and Faber,
<br>
1945, better known in the US as Soil and Health when published a few years
<br>
later by Rodale. He had 26 years of field experience in widely seperate
<br>
centers in India.  In that last book he wrote:
<br>
<p>&quot;This experience, covering a period of 26 years...convinced me that
<br>
foot-and-mouth disease is a consequence of malnutrition pure and simple, and
<br>
that the remedies which have been devised in countries like Great Britian to
<br>
deal with the trouble, namely, the slaughter of the affected animals, are
<br>
both superficial and also inadmissible.  Such attempts to control an
<br>
outbreak should cease.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Cases of foot-and-mouth diease should be utilized to tune up practice and
<br>
to see to it that the animals are fed on the fresh produce of fertile soil.
<br>
The trouble will then pass and will not spread to the surrounding areas,
<br>
providing the animals there are also in good fettle.  Foot-and-mouth
<br>
outbreaks are a sure sign of bad farming.&quot;
<br>
[For more info on Howard, including further details of his experience with
<br>
FMD, check out <a href="http://www.soilandhealth.org/">http://www.soilandhealth.org/</a> and click on the link to
<br>
Agriculture Library, several of his books are online there]
<br>
<p>As I understand it, the blood test used to determine the presence of the FMD
<br>
virus is known as an ELISA test or enzyme linked immuno-absorbent assay
<br>
test. The test delivers the positive reading by detecting proteins and
<br>
antibodies in the blood, proteins and antibodies which are presumed to be
<br>
there as a result the presence of the virus. This is fine if someone first
<br>
properly isolates the virus and then extracts the proteins, genetic
<br>
material, etc, from the viral isolate.  Then tests can be properly
<br>
calibrated, comparing positive results on the test with actual viral
<br>
isolation from the same subjects.  If you don't have a proper viral isolate,
<br>
you can't be sure that the proteins or antibodies are viral in nature.  They
<br>
could be produced by the subject itself under stress, and are, therefore,
<br>
markers of undefined ill health. As I understand it, FMD has not been
<br>
properly isolated.
