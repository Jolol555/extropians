<p><em>&gt; I strongly encourage people to pay attention to their own mindsets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you *think* that people can only do limited things, then I'm quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure that those limitations will be ONLY what you see, and you will find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself in dreamy wistfulness &quot;wishing&quot; for something to exist, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you won't see it, even if it is in front of your very nose.
</em><br>
<p>But Amara, to be fair to the person who thought women scientists are
<br>
unusual, it's *true* to a great extent that they're unusual, especially
<br>
women in positions of academic power. There are more female scientists now
<br>
than there were 25 years ago, but there still aren't very many who have
<br>
reached the top such that they're running research programsm heading
<br>
departments and so forth.
<br>
<p>When I was 22 years old with a university degree and a commercial pilot's
<br>
license I applied to join the Air Force. I wanted to fly a plane, not a
<br>
desk. The guy who interviewed me laughed. You idiot, *girls* don't fly
<br>
planes. In retrospect, it's good I didn't join the military. I'd have hated
<br>
it; and if I'd been turned down because I had too much of an independent
<br>
spirit or a problem with obeying authority, I'd have said, okay, I see your
<br>
point. Nuff said. But to be laughed at because of my sex! I was a dmaned
<br>
good pilot too. For a girl. Just one memory out of many such.
<br>
<p>So no one has to tell me anything about being discriminated against. Believe
<br>
me, I recognize it when I see it. But I didn't see that sort of thing in the
<br>
&quot;cool athiest scientist chick&quot; message.
<br>
