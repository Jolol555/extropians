<p>Actually, you bring up one of the rare instances in which a 
<br>
person's ethnic heritage has explanatory power.  (In most
<br>
cases, as you know, you cannot explain the single success
<br>
or failure, or indeed any trait, of an **individual** by
<br>
appealing to the stereotype, even if statistically speaking
<br>
that stereotype is correct.)
<br>
<p>But Nils Bohr is an exception.  All of his bad ideas were due
<br>
to his father and the culture from which his father came.
<br>
&quot;Complimentarity&quot;, for example, was even a philosophy that
<br>
had been articulated in a general philosophic way by his 
<br>
father, who also &quot;worshipped&quot; Goethe.  (Richard Rhodes,
<br>
&quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb.&quot;)  All of his good physics---
<br>
his literalness as a young child, powerful abilities to
<br>
deal with abstractions completely divorced from the concrete---
<br>
came, I submit, from his mother's side.  So Nils Bohr was
<br>
(in large part) a great physicist **because** his mother
<br>
was Jewish.
<br>
<p>But your point is well taken in the general case.  Genius
<br>
must occur in all nationalities and racial groups, because
<br>
the normal distribution rules.
