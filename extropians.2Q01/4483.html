Slashdot pointed a few weeks ago to an article about how LISP gave
<br>
a competitive advantage to Viaweb, which provided turnkey Internet
<br>
storefronts.  This software is now running Yahoo! Stores.  The article
<br>
is by Paul Graham, who co-developed the software with Robert Morris
<br>
(yes, the Internet Worm guy).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such fast turnaround on bug fixes put us into an impossibly tempting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position.  If we could catch and fix a bug while the user was still on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the phone, it was very tempting for us to give the user the impression
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they were imagining it.  And so we sometimes (to their delight)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had the customer support people tell the user to just try logging
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in again and see if they still had the problem.  And of course when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user logged back in they'd get the newly released version of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the software with the bug fixed, and everything would work fine.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize this was a bit sneaky of us, but it was also a lot of fun.
