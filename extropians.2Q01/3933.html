<em>&gt; Thanks for the extra information, 'Gene. Doesn't it cost a lot to cover your

<p>Sure, if you do it after the house was built. Now if you plan the thin-film
<br>
PV to be part of the facade/roof, it's just an incremental cost on structural
<br>
materials, and of course the economies of scale will soon make it about as
<br>
expensive as floatglass sheets. Future alternatives involve flexible solar cells,
<br>
possibly from plastic, and artificial photosynthesis, after we get a lot better
<br>
with understanding the photosynthetic center, and create cheap, long-lasting
<br>
substitutes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; were a feasible alternative to paying the electric utility companies, wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Californians be doing it right now? And if it is a feasible alternative,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't we be investing in fuel cell manufacturing?
</em><br>
<p>Energy is cheap, and installation costs are high, it needs some R&amp;D and 
<br>
a decade of economy of scale powered growth.
