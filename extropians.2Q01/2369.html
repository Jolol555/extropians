<br>
&lt;&lt;Ok... that's like saying &quot;Let them buy thier crack, eventually, they'll die
<br>
off because of it, and the world will be better for it.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, I don't know if I'd go quite that far, but perhaps you've come up with a
<br>
kind of solution (reminescent of the &quot;7% solution&quot;). This policy would
<br>
probably do well in US prisons, where more than half of inmates have been
<br>
convicted of drug offenses. Naturally this approach would only involve
<br>
volunteers.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;  It strikes me as a rather socially irresponsible view.  They *dont* die
<br>
off.  Drug addicts today, and simsense addicts tommrow, always have a stead
<br>
suppply of new converts, and the rest of society suffers for it.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Probably one of the most destructive and anti-social memes (are memes real, or
<br>
just another useless hypothesis?) going around these days is the accusation of
<br>
social irresponsibility. If your're sincerely concerned about social
<br>
responsibility, then you should support responsible policy vis a vis the
<br>
so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot; which would mean ending it.
<br>
<p>Anyway, you started off with &quot;Abuse of future neuroscience applied
<br>
technologies&quot; and now you're confuting that with illegal drug use. Do you have
<br>
an ulterior agenda here... one which would place applied neuroscience
<br>
technologies in the same category with illicit drugs?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;  Further I happen to believe that people have intrinsic value in
<br>
themselves.  Letting them deal with the consequences of thier actions is one
<br>
thing, but letting them die because they made a few foolish choices is pretty
<br>
damn jaded.  What, you don't believe in social support nets, and catching
<br>
somebody when they stumble and fall, rather than just letting them smash thier
<br>
head on the sidewalk? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>So we need to institute social support nets for people who are addicted to
<br>
games? And who provides social support nets for the bureaucrats who are
<br>
addicted to the game of providing social support nets? No thanks. The position
<br>
of Extropy Institute and other groups dedicated to improving life by expanding
<br>
technology seems more responsible to me.
<br>
<p>I've noticed a suspicious correlation between the numbers of social support
<br>
nets that spring up like mushrooms, and the incidence of sociopath behaviors
<br>
reported in the news. Like the newsman said, &quot;Follow the money,&quot; if you want
<br>
to understand how society works. In this case, the money leads to career
<br>
busy-bodies who would be out of jobs if the supposed social problems they
<br>
decry were to evaporate. You see, the social engineers have a heavy investment
<br>
in preserving, rather than eradicating, social problems.
<br>
<p>BTW, here's some information about memetics, which some people consider part
<br>
of neuroscience (but I'm not so sure):
<br>
<a href="http://www.memecentral.com/">http://www.memecentral.com/</a>
<br>
Welcome to Meme Central, the center of the world of memetics. Memes are
<br>
contagious ideas, all competing for a share of our mind in a kind of Darwinian
<br>
selection. As memes evolve, they become better and better at distracting and
<br>
diverting us from whatever we'd really like to be doing with our lives. They
<br>
are a kind of Drug of the Mind. Confused? Blame it on memes.
<br>
<p>Perhaps &quot;Abuse of future neuroscience applied technologies&quot; is just a meme
<br>
that we can make go away by ignoring it... or by invoking the game-playing
<br>
meme.
<br>

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
