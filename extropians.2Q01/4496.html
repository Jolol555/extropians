</em><br>
<p>Why is that?  I don't see the connection.  To me it looks like the precise
<br>
opposite effect ought to obtain; time travel is very computationally
<br>
expensive, if not outright impossible to &quot;simulate&quot; without an actual time
<br>
machine, and should just happen to not be developed in most simulations of
<br>
a pre-Singularity world.
<br>
<p>I have to say that the possibility gives me the screaming meemies,
<br>
especially since the whole thing sounds like it would easily be within the
<br>
reach of a medium-sized laboratory rather than a massive trillion-dollar
<br>
project.  There are some things that Man Was Not Meant To Tamper With
<br>
Before The Singularity.  Why the dickens did Mallett take this to a
<br>
newspaper instead of the NSA?  I'd much rather that this was a government
<br>
black project.
<br>
<p>Oh, well, if we're going to do this pre-Singularity, we might as well
<br>
build a long-term-stable time machine sooner rather than later, so
<br>
post-Singularity we can go back and collect everyone who's died since
<br>
then.  Just have to make sure the effect is wide enough to dump a fair
<br>
collection of femtomachines down the tube, and that nobody uses it to take
<br>
over the world in the meanwhile.
