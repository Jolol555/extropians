<p>Curt, I'm sorry but this just isn't so.  I believe it has been concretely
<br>
proven in a paper in Science in the last year that thermal noise roundly
<br>
trumps any &quot;quantum&quot; effects in the brain (disproving Penrose's microtubule
<br>
consciousness speculations).  [Someone will hopefully provide a link here...]
<br>
<p>As I've discussed you can perfect &quot;reality conforming&quot; simulations using
<br>
only electromagnetic bonding theories.  Current simulations range in the
<br>
million-to-billion atom range (a large distance from a kg of matter, but
<br>
Moore's law still has a way to run).  It is entirely unnecessary to
<br>
go to the quantum level.  *ONLY* in those cases where people are conducting
<br>
experiments designed to go to the quantum level (at least 5 orders of
<br>
magnitude more sensitive) does the simulation have to go to that level.
<br>
At any point in time, there may only be a dozen or so such experiments
<br>
being conducted on the planet -- it doesn't remotely tax the computational
<br>
requirements of the overall simulation.
<br>
<p>When you wake up tomorrow, go over to the wall in your bedroom and pound
<br>
on it.  Up until the point where your fist hits the wall it could be
<br>
no more than several hundred atoms in thickness.  And as soon as you
<br>
leave your bedroom it can be 0 atoms in thickness.  And this doesn't
<br>
even take into account the fact that the sim can make you believe
<br>
it goes from a few hundreds of atoms to billions instantaneously when
<br>
in fact it doesn't do that at all -- the variable containing the perceived
<br>
strength of the wall simply gets multiplied by 10^10 as soon as
<br>
you think that you should hit the wall with your fist to ascertain
<br>
its thickness.
