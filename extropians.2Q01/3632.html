As an addendum, I would even suggest that it might be possible to
<br>
come up with standard cultural and heuristic models for behavior
<br>
and personality, then simpy add the unique tweaks that describe a
<br>
&quot;me&quot; versus a &quot;you&quot;, add to that, the persistent stories of my life
<br>
and the concerns that shape my particular instantiation of human
<br>
being, and POOF, you should have a pretty good facsimile of that
<br>
personality I call &quot;ME&quot;.
<br>
<p>Strange... at some level that just isn't at all what I'm interested in
<br>
having survive.
<br>
<p>I don't consider my &quot;self&quot;, my personality. Just as I don't consider
<br>
my &quot;self&quot; my body. These are things I have, part of the price of
<br>
admission to play this odd life game. But there is a something I
<br>
experience as deeper, more fundamental that the stuff which I
<br>
sport about. That is my being, my capacity to be, my passion
<br>
to be, my joy and profound desire to be, the context that is at
<br>
the heart of all the things I become, I do, and then produce.
<br>
<p>I have little attachment to the stuff of me, I have great attachment
<br>
to the source of me. That is what I would preserve, what I would
<br>
promote, and ultimately what I want to take to the stars. The
<br>
dance itself is lovely, but it's that ability to dance, the full
<br>
expression
<br>
of which is devine.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, at least E. O. Wilson would.  But when you say &quot;type&quot;,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two conspecifics of a particular ant species just aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that different.  So pop some randomly-chosen handful of ants into
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you step on a few other ants in the process.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; I remember seeing somebody (I'm pretty sure it was Eliezer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comment that, as far as human personalities are concerned,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's probably only a surprisingly small number (on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of a million, I think was the offered guess) of distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human memetic &quot;types&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I imagine it wouldn't take a lot of data to blend up somebody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot like Jim F. at the personality paint store.  Garden-variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mid-20th-century style American middle-class background (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words, economic circumstances better than the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of contemporary human beings), only child, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; timid and introverted (maybe genetic, maybe because he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the somewhat premature Caesarian first child of a mother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who was almost past child-bearing age), modestly gifted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually (140ish IQ).  Then throw in the DC comic books,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the squirt of Arthur C. Clarke, the dollop of J. R. R. Tolkien,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _The Outer Limits_ and _Star Trek_, a little Bertrand Russell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for seasoning, and voila!  OK, so maybe nobody else remembers the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular house in Shavertown, Pennsylvania where my grandparents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lived in the 60's, or Gelbach's Diner in Reading where we used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to stop on the way to visit them.  But there were a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awfully similar elderly couples, houses, and diners.  Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these differences makes a difference worth preserving, in how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much detail? (I know that's an unanswerable, purely rhetorical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So yeah, it would be one thing to be preserved as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random example of the &quot;type&quot; of the human species, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some post-holocaust alien-rescue scenario like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis books, or to be chosen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a zoo-specimen by an alien E. O. Wilson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist/collector as in Gregory Benford's _Eater_.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But how many of us can really objectively believe that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embody a pattern so unique and valuable that we couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be replaced by one of the other six billion humans on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planet (or some pattern synthesized from the &quot;types&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they represent) without making a dent in the history of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cosmos?  That's not to say it wouldn't be fun to be along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the ride, but that's different -- it's a question of,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, entertainment.
