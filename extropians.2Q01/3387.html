I believe this article:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel041601.shtml">http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel041601.shtml</a>
<br>
extracted from this Nanodot discussion:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=01/04/17/1432244&mode=thread">http://nanodot.org/article.pl?sid=01/04/17/1432244&mode=thread</a>
<br>
makes it questionable whether the U.S. government has the
<br>
power granted by the constitution to criminalize human
<br>
cloning.  [I'd be interested in Greg's opinion on this.]
<br>
<p>Now whether or not anyone would ever see fit to challenge
<br>
the law or whether our silly supreme court would find some
<br>
reason to not take the case (or worse yet extended the
<br>
constitution to allow the law) remain areas for speculation.
<br>
(It isn't clear from the analysis whether individual states
<br>
have the power to criminalize human cloning, I suspect it
<br>
may depend upon individual state constitutions.)
<br>
<p>But I'm strongly of the opinion that extended discussion or
<br>
worry about these topics by extropians may be a waste of
<br>
effort.  It looks like the laws are coming down along the
<br>
lines of -- &quot;allow stem cell research&quot; but &quot;ban making
<br>
human twins of different ages&quot;.  I think the &quot;banning&quot;
<br>
aspect may be a &quot;reasonable&quot; bone to throw to the luddites.
<br>
It will make them think they got something which in fact is
<br>
virtually nothing from our perspective.  Contrast that with
<br>
the scenario where if the first human clone turned out to
<br>
be a genetic misfit due to mutations in the cloning or
<br>
development process.  Then you might see a backlash that
<br>
would actually roll back NIH funding.  You *do not* want
<br>
that.  NIH funding is going to be edging up to around
<br>
$20 billion soon and is somewhere in the middle of a ~5
<br>
year doubling track.
<br>
<p>There is *no* benefit that I can see to &quot;childless&quot; couples 
<br>
that to my mind justifies putting that trend at risk.
<br>
In fact, one can make a &quot;reasonable&quot; argument that
<br>
postponing having *any* children for the next 5-10 years
<br>
makes sense as you will be bringing them into a more
<br>
biotech/nanotech enabled world.  If you know that in 5-10
<br>
years, you will be able to genetically select children
<br>
based on intelligence you can make a strong argument that
<br>
any &quot;natural&quot; children (clones or not) are going to be
<br>
at a distinct environmental disadvantage growing up
<br>
and as young adults, and thus having 'naturals' now may
<br>
be viewed as 'intentionally' handicapping your children.
<br>
<p>So I personally don't see laws against the &quot;cloning&quot; of
<br>
human babies as really relevant.  Since I'd bet we get
<br>
designer babies in ~10 years and its going to be
<br>
difficult to prevent couples from &quot;ordering&quot; one from
<br>
someplace in the world, I think the perspective of the
<br>
anti-cloners is going to suffer a rapid but noisy death.
