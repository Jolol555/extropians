<p>
I've never been involved in role-playing games (in fact, I only have the 
<br>
vaguest idea of how they work), but the notion of making a maximally 
<br>
realistic space-development simulation environment - yes, a &quot;game&quot; - has been 
<br>
one I've thought about over the years more than I care to admit.  Back before 
<br>
I went cold turkey on sim games (because of the inordinate amount of time and 
<br>
energy I devoted to them), I was always on the lookout for really good space 
<br>
simulator games.  The two best that I recall were a relatively early 
<br>
DOS-based space shuttle flight simulator and then Microsoft's &quot;Space 
<br>
Simulator&quot;.  The first of these had the fairly primitive graphics of its day 
<br>
(c. 1992 or so?) and the second had a lot of sad shortcuts and shortcomings, 
<br>
but was still a lot of fun to play with.  Neither did what I had always 
<br>
envisioned, which was a full-featured spaceflight and space development 
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>The &quot;dream sim&quot; I have imagined would have at its core a very realistic 
<br>
digital orrery as the basic ground within which the rest of the system would 
<br>
operate, just as modern flight simulator programs have come to have 
<br>
increasingly realistic aerodynamics simulations at their core.  In its full 
<br>
iteration the game would have two or three distinct levels of access.  In one 
<br>
mode, you could get &quot;in&quot; a spacecraft and pilot it through all phases of its 
<br>
operation.  At another level, one could play with strategic scenarios.  
<br>
<p>One scenario I've envisioned I call &quot;Space Race&quot;.  In that scenario, the 
<br>
player starts at some actual point in history - say 1955.  In this mode, 
<br>
there is a political and economic overlay in which the player - choosing the 
<br>
US or Soviet &quot;side&quot; - makes annual project development choices, allocating 
<br>
her budget to development of different facilities and capabilities, from 
<br>
launch complexes, to boosters, to spacecraft.  The player also develops and 
<br>
&quot;astronaut team&quot; and has to train the individual characters in that team and, 
<br>
eventually assign them to missions.  A system of &quot;experience points&quot; is 
<br>
accrued to specific astronauts and ground teams that have to matched to the 
<br>
developing technical capabilities of the hardware and other systems being 
<br>
developed.  Depending on the &quot;difficulty level&quot; chosen, extrinsic factors 
<br>
will impact successive total budget amounts, as well as the iterated 
<br>
achievements and failures of the program the player develops and guides.  
<br>
This could be played against another player guiding the competing space 
<br>
program or a game AI.  The system would allow you to explore the possibility 
<br>
of following alternative development paths: Build the X-20, the Nerva-powered 
<br>
super-Saturn, go for a big orbital station early, etc.  All of this is played 
<br>
out against the real configuration of the orerry, so that launch windows open 
<br>
and close, come and go, etc.
<br>
<p>Scenarios could be developed and started at different points in history or 
<br>
future history.  This the scenario you're developing for your game, Anders, 
<br>
could be a starting condition for a sim.  Likewise, a player could shift 
<br>
levels, being both program manager and astronaut at different times.  In 
<br>
later scenarios, one could distribute resources on the moon and in the 
<br>
asteroids to be &quot;discovered&quot; and developed.
<br>
<p>At one time, I wrote up a detailed system design for this imagined system 
<br>
that grew to many dozens of pages, but I long ago abandoned that idea when I 
<br>
realized that the coding would be equal to or greater than the most elaborate 
<br>
games available today.  I suppose no one will ever develop this game.  
<br>
There's too much of a market for &quot;spaceship&quot; shoot-em-ups where &quot;fighters&quot; go 
<br>
&quot;whoosh!&quot; and bank through turns, firing energy weapons that work like the 
<br>
machine guns on a P-51.  Oh well . . .
