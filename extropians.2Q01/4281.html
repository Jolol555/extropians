<p>I am sufficiently innocent of Bayesian statistics that I have to

admit that anything is possible; if you're right, then there is

a demarcation between what mathematicians would or should say,

and what statisticians could or do say.   :-)

<p>But why are the parents who *do* say &quot;At least...&quot;   different than

the parents who *could* say it?  The earlier idea, who *could* truthfully

<br>
would seem to me to depend a great deal upon the particular situation. 
<br>
One easily contrives a situation where even under *do* I'm right:  King

Harod orders everybody who could say it to go to a mathematician and
<br>
actually say it, etc.   What situations do you have in mind where
