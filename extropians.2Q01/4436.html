Emlyn wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; Through some strange confluence of events, it seems that I am to appear on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my current favourite tv program, Aftershock (Australia, ABC, Thursdays
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8:30pm).
</em><br>
<p>Congratulations!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, I'm throwing it open to the peanut gallery. If you were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk publicly about cyborged humans in the nearish future, what would you
</em><br>
say?
<br>
<p>I'd start with required advances first:
<br>
- mechanical exoskeletal legs to allow people to walk instead of using
<br>
wheelchairs
<br>
- mechanical eyes to allow the blind to see
<br>
- mechanical hearts to replaced damaged ones
<br>
- artificial organs to ease the shortage of real ones
<br>
<p>Then move into optional advances later:
<br>
- why not use those exoskeletal legs to allow non-runners to run a marathon?
<br>
- why not use artificial lungs to make scuba diving easier?
<br>
- why not use artificial eyes to allow crime fighters to see in the dark or
<br>
x-ray through walls
<br>
<p>Then move into entertainment advances:
<br>
- why not use those exoskeletal legs to perform amazing dance sequences or
<br>
sporting feats?
<br>
- why not use artificial eyes to hook into computers directly?
<br>
- why not use artificial ears to synthesize and edit music directly?
<br>
- why not have an implanted cell phone in your ear just for the convenience
<br>
of it?
<br>
- why not have an implanted internet hookup just to surf the net from
<br>
anywhere?
<br>
- why not let surfers get a permanent coating on their skin instead of
<br>
having to smear on sunscreen every few hours?
<br>
- why not let accountants get a built-in calculator in their head instead of
<br>
having to carry one around everywhere?
<br>
<p>I'd start with the obviously needed medical advancements first.  Then, once
<br>
we have them, we can use them for useful purposes.  Then, once they are
<br>
common or cheap, we can use them as toys or superfluous purposes.
<br>
Eyeglasses used to be functional, but now they're a fashion statement.
<br>
Contacts used to be hidden, now they are used to change eye color.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Killer app 1: Life extension...
</em><br>
<p>Obviously a necessity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Killer app 2: Net connection...
</em><br>
<p>For the computer-savvy, this seems necessary.  To some, it is extraneous
<br>
entertainment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Killer app 3: Eternal youth and the beauty industry...
</em><br>
<p>This is where people get scared.  It's &quot;unfair&quot; that other people with
<br>
outlive them or look better by &quot;cheating&quot; with technology.  They could
<br>
&quot;cheat&quot; too, but many people think we should stick with our God-given
<br>
attributes.  Religion quickly comes into play here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or that, after installing some IBM human memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion, they inexpicably foul themselves whenever they think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft products.
</em><br>
<p>We already have this today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This whole discussion of mine probably looks hopelessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ill-informed to many of you... so tell me why.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you had many wonderful and complicated thoughts all thrown out at
<br>
once.  I'm sure you'll get a lot of feedback, but you already are doing
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>It seems like you don't consider yourself an expert in this field.  You may
<br>
not be an expert compared to some people you know, but compared to the
<br>
viewing public and the TV reporters, you are already far surpassing what
<br>
they are going to be able to cover in a single episode.
<br>
<p>Good Luck!  Will it be carried on any C1 satellites that I might be able to
<br>
tap into?  I would love to see the show.
