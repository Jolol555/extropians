<p>The obvious fallacy is that you have to lift your energy source.  For chemical
<br>
rockets, the reaction mass is also the energy source, so I do not think you can
<br>
beat them.  If you have a means to deliver energy to the craft from either the
<br>
ground or space based beams, there may be some usefulness.  (We have discussed
<br>
beam power rockets here many times.)
