<br>
Life Extension Update Exclusive brings you news each week that you will
<br>
only receive in the ezine.
<br>
<p>Indole-3-carbinol kills ovarian cancer cells and boosts chemotherapy
<br>
<p>In a study presented at the thirty-second annual meeting of the Society of
<br>
Gynecologic Oncologists held this month, researchers from North Shore/Long
<br>
Island Jewish Research Institute and North Shore/Long Island University
<br>
Hospital presented the results of a National Cancer Institute funded study
<br>
that showed indole-3-carbinol and its product diindolylmethane (DIM) both
<br>
had a toxic effect on ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Indole-3-carbinol is
<br>
a phytonutrient found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and
<br>
cabbage that has been demonstrated to have cancer preventive properties as
<br>
well as the ability to slow the progression of some cancers. The authors
<br>
note that it is currently being used to prevent human papilloma virus
<br>
related cancers.
<br>
<p>Two ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with indole-3-carbinol or DIM
<br>
in various concentrations for two to four days. Cell viability was
<br>
measured by mitochondrial function. Both indole-3-carbinol and DIM showed
<br>
toxicity to both lines after a two day period. The two substances were
<br>
then combined with the cancer chemotherapy drug cis-platinum to test their
<br>
effects. Both compounds enhanced the toxicity of the drug toward the
<br>
cancer cell line known as OVCAR-3, known to be resistant to cis-platinum.
<br>
The combination of cis-platinum and another chemotherapeutic drug,
<br>
paclitaxel, was able to kill 70% of the ovarian cancer cells in this line,
<br>
but when diindoylmethane was added it resulted in complete destruction of
<br>
the cells. Diindoylmethane alone in one concentration was able to kill all
<br>
of the cells in the other ovarian cancer cell line in a matter of four
<br>
days.
<br>
<p>The researchers  believe that both indole-3-carbinol and diindoylmethane
<br>
will prove useful as adjunctive agents in ovarian cancer management and
<br>
note that further studies are in progress.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Another cancer associated with hormone replacement therapy
<br>
<p>The use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by women during and following
<br>
menopause has recently been found to be linked with an elevated risk of
<br>
breast and endometrial cancer, as well as failing to protect against
<br>
cardiovascular disease. A large study published in the March 21 2001 issue
<br>
of the Journal of the American Medical Association shows that hormone
<br>
replacement appears to increase the risk of ovarian cancer as well.
<br>
Ovarian cancer is usually detected in its late stages making it difficult
<br>
to treat.
<br>
<p>The study utilized data from the American Cancer Society's Cancer
<br>
Prevention Study II, which followed up participants for mortality from
<br>
1982 to 1996. Of the 676,526 people enrolled in this study who completed
<br>
questionnaires in 1982, there were 211,581 postmenopausal cancer-free
<br>
women who did not report a hysterectomy. During the fourteen year
<br>
follow-up period, 944 members of this group succumbed to death from
<br>
ovarian cancer.
<br>
<p>Twenty-two percent of the women reported noncontraceptive hormone
<br>
replacement use on their questionnaires. The highest risk of ovarian
<br>
cancer was found in women who had used hormone replacement therapy for ten
<br>
or more years. This risk was present up to twenty-nine years after hormone
<br>
replacement was discontinued. Those who were using hormone replacement the
<br>
most recently experienced a higher risk than those who had previously used
<br>
it. Women who had used HRT for less than ten years had a small but
<br>
insignificant increased risk. The lowest risk of ovarian cancer was found
<br>
in women who had never been on HRT, in whom an annual age-adjusted death
<br>
rate from ovarian cancer was 26.4 per 100,000 women, compared to that of
<br>
64.4 for those who were on HRT at the beginning of the study and who had
<br>
used it for ten or more years.
<br>
<p>The authors postulate two mechanisms of action for postmenopausal
<br>
estrogen: decreased gonadotropins caused by elevated serum estradiol and
<br>
estrone levels, or a direct effect of estrogen on ovarian cells. They
<br>
state that if their results are confirmed, clinicians will need to add
<br>
ovarian cancer to the list of longterm estrogen use risks.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Cancer Surgery
<br>
<p>Surgery poses many risks to a cancer patient. The known side effects
<br>
associated with the surgical removal of tumors include anesthesia
<br>
complications, infections, and immune suppression.  A newly discovered
<br>
surgery side effect of concern to cancer patients is that the removal of
<br>
the primary tumor may directly stimulate the propagation of metastatic
<br>
lesions. The theory is that an intact primary tumor regulates the growth
<br>
of metastatic lesions by naturally secreting antiangiogenesis agents such
<br>
as endostatin and angiostatin. Metastatic tumors require the formation of
<br>
new blood vessels (called angiogenesis) in order to grow. Once the primary
<br>
tumor has been surgically removed, the amount of endostatin and
<br>
angiostatin to control new blood vessel growth is drastically reduced, and
<br>
metastasized lesions begin proliferating out of control. If the immune
<br>
depression that surgery induces is factored in, the failure of surgery to
<br>
meaningfully prolong the life of cancer patients becomes quite
<br>
understandable. Surgery takes away growth control factors (endostatin and
<br>
angiostatin) while simultaneously weakening the immune surveillance that
<br>
might be keeping metastatic lesions under some degree of control.
<br>
<p>Almost every tissue in the body derives blood from the thinner-than-a-hair
<br>
capillaries that lace our tissues. Through capillaries, nutrients, oxygen
<br>
and various signaling molecules diffuse into cells. These mechanisms
<br>
maintain health, fight disease, and allow the body to flourish and grow.
<br>
<p>Scientists have found that tumors start out without circulation. In the
<br>
early stages of tumor development, they are limited to a trickle of
<br>
nutrients that can diffuse from the nearest capillaries. Then, somehow,
<br>
tumors begin to stimulate healthy tissue to make thousands of new blood
<br>
vessels to supply the cancerous growth-a process called angiogenesis.
<br>
Without this ability to nourish itself and grow, a tumor cannot enlarge.
<br>
If the blood supply can be reduced or cut off, the tumor will shrink or
<br>
die.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
Indole-3-carbinol
<br>
<p>Strong evidence suggests that the risk of many cancers can be reduced by
<br>
eating lots of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and other cruciferous
<br>
vegetables. The problem is that the amount of cancer fighting compounds
<br>
varies in each crop harvested, and most people just don't eat enough
<br>
cancer-preventing vegetables on a consistent basis. Food scientists have
<br>
isolated indole-3-carbinol and are making it available to the supplement
<br>
market for the first time at an affordable price. The Life Extension
<br>
Foundation has been publishing information about indole-3-carbinol since
<br>
1983, and a summary of recent studies shows that this vegetable extract:
<br>
<p>Increased the conversion of estradiol to the safer estriol by 50% in
<br>
twelve healthy people in just one week.
<br>
Prevented the formation of the carcinogenic estrogen metabolie
<br>
16-alpha-hydroxy estrone in two months in 17 men and women.
<br>
Stops human cancer cells from growing (54-61%) and provokes the cells to
<br>
self-destruct (apoptosis).
<br>
Inhibits MCF7 human breast cancer cells from growing by as much as 90% in
<br>
culture.
<br>
Inhibits an estrogen metabolite (16-alpha-hydroxyestrone) that prompts
<br>
breast cancer cells to grow.
<br>
Competes with dioxin for the Ah receptor to help keep dioxin out of cells.
<br>
Prevented chemically-induced breast cancer in rodents by 70-96% Prevented
<br>
other types of cancer, including aflatoxin-induced liver cancer, leukemia
<br>
and colon cancer.
<br>
Inhibits free radicals, particularly those that cause the oxidation of
<br>
fat.
<br>
Inhibits the growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells by
<br>
90%, compared to tamoxifen's 60%, by stopping the cell cycle.
<br>
Stopped the synthesis of DNA for new cells by about 50% in estrogen
<br>
receptor-negative cells whereas tamoxifen had no significant effect.
<br>
Restores p21 and other proteins that act as check points during the
<br>
synthesis of a new cancer cell. Tamoxifen has no effect on p21.
<br>
Virtually eliminated DNA damage and cancer when animals were fed it before
<br>
exposure to cancer-causing chemicals.
<br>
Reduced DNA damage in breast cells by 91%. Similar results happen in the
<br>
liver.
<br>
Reduces levels of a major carcinogen in female smokers.

<p>Modified Citrus Pectin
<br>
<p>Cancer cell metastasis is the mechanism of disease progression that leads
<br>
to death for most cancer patients.  A special pH-altered form of citrus
<br>
pectin has been shown to interfere with cancer cell metastasis by
<br>
inhibiting the ability of cancer cells to adhere to other cells in the
<br>
body. It inhibits metastasis by interfering with cellular interactions
<br>
that are required for the transport and proliferation of tumor cells to
<br>
secondary sites in the body.
<br>
Additional research on Modified Citrus Pectin shows that it enhances the
<br>
activity of natural killer immune cells, which are required to destroy
<br>
migrating cancer cells in the bloodstream.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE, MARCH 2001
<br>
Vegetables without vitamins
<br>
<p>That's what happened to nutritionist, Alex Jack, when he went to check out
<br>
the latest US Department of Agriculture food tables. The stunning
<br>
revelation came after Jack compared recently published nutrient values
<br>
with an old USDA handbook he had lying around. Some of the differences in
<br>
vitamin and mineral content were enormous-a 50% drop in the amount of
<br>
calcium in broccoli, for example. Watercress down 88% in iron content;
<br>
cauliflower down 40% in vitamin C content-all since 1975.
<br>
<p>Jack took his findings to the USDA, hoping for a reasonable explanation.
<br>
That was two years ago. He's still waiting. So is Organic Gardening
<br>
magazine, which published an open letter, seeking an explanation from Dan
<br>
Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture. Glickman didn't respond, but USDA
<br>
employee, Phyllis E. Johnson did. Johnson (who is head of the Beltsville
<br>
area office), suggested to Organic Gardening that the nutrient drain
<br>
should be put in context. According to her, the 78% decrease in calcium
<br>
content of corn is not significant because no one eats corn for calcium.
<br>
She further explains that the problem may not even exist at all; that the
<br>
apparent nutrient dips could be due to the testing procedures. For
<br>
example, &quot;changes in the public's perception of what the edible portion is
<br>
may determine what parts have been analyzed over time.&quot; In other words,
<br>
back when the old food tables were made up, people may have been eating
<br>
the cobb too, so they got more nutrients.
