<em>&gt; Depends on how long ago this occurred, what kinds of microbes we're

<p>Sure its sensible, however, they don't seem to even discuss the
<br>
possibility, so they don't seem to be planning for all contingencies.
<br>
Making sure the probe is microbe free, of course, would demonstrate that
<br>
any microbes found there that were sufficiently similar to those of
<br>
earth would be evidence it had been seeded from earth in the past (or
<br>
vice versa).
