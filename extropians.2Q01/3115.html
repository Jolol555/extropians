<p>
<em>&gt; Right now the journal system is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process of change as net publications are emerging and challenging the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traditional paper journals,
</em><br>
<p>Following that thought -
<br>
<p>I learned last Fall from an article in Physics Today (1) that several
<br>
subfields of physics almost completely bypass the paper journals and rely
<br>
on the Los Alamos Preprint Server (<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a>). In particular,
<br>
the string theorists and the condensed matter theory folks. These researchers
<br>
check the lanl archive every day for new information. They post all their
<br>
papers there, cite references by archive number, use the search engine to
<br>
find other papers, and need little or no other publication service. It costs
<br>
the users nothing, is self-organizing, and is far more 'democratic' than
<br>
the paper journal process. Apparently lanl is the biggest driver forcing
<br>
a complete reavluation of the role of journals.
<br>
<p>The author does claim that perhaps the string theorists are not characteristic
<br>
of mainstream scientific research: their research are in a world of their own,
<br>
distantly removed from other branches of theoretical physics.
<br>
<p>About referreeing- this author states that the large part of the expenses
<br>
of editorial offices of journals is spent in reviewing papers. The string
<br>
theory folks say that that referee effort is not necessary- that the bad
<br>
papers at the Los Alamos archive are simply ignored. The papers that are
<br>
interesting and controversial attract instant attention and thus,
<br>
effectively _intantly_ refereed. However, the author states that, even
<br>
with the problems of paper journal refereeing, the quality of the paper
<br>
is always improved, which I would agree with, from my own experiences.
<br>
<p>The author of the article states that there is progress toward merging
<br>
journals from the American Physical Society with the Los Alamos e-print
<br>
archive, and he expects that ultimately the nonrefereed part of the system
<br>
will be the predominant mode of real-time scientific communication, and
<br>
that the refereed part will become more selective, emphasizing in-depth
<br>
analysis and reviews and providing a mechanism for authenticating the
<br>
validity and priority of research results.
