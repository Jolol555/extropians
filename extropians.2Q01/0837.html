<p>Essentially yes.  The &quot;Dyson-net/Web&quot; (to differentiate it from everything
<br>
else we have) is a solar-sail based design that Jeff's theorizing prompted
<br>
a discussion of.  You certainly can do computing with it (gates only
<br>
need 3 atom thickness now (with the conductors added on top of that)).
<br>
You can certainly have somewhat thick regions centered in a lightened
<br>
solar sail design (the most advanced solar sail designs are now &quot;holey&quot;
<br>
with the holes being smaller than the impinging light wavelengths).
<br>
<p>Spike, I think the way you need to do this calculation is to figure out
<br>
the minimum area required to radiate the heat from a 400 nm^3 diamondoid
<br>
nanoputer.  You need to dissipate 60 nW (plus any power conversion losses
<br>
(~60-70% more if you go photovoltaic).  We will assume with diamonidoid
<br>
material you can solve the heat conduction problems (i.e. no cooling fluid -
<br>
unlike an MBrain).  Probably assume an operating temperature of around
<br>
500 deg. C since diamond can probably go that high or somewhat higher.
<br>
<p>You then want to determine whether that mass of that is and whether it
<br>
can be supported by the light pressure and what orbits it can maintain
<br>
itself in (by allowing more or less light to &quot;flow&quot; through it.  Though
<br>
I didn't think of it before, you not only can have nano-mirrors to vector
<br>
the photons in different directions, you can also have nano-irises
<br>
that control light &quot;flow&quot; through the material.
<br>
<p>What it is &quot;good&quot; for (if the design holds up) is 2-D cellular automata
<br>
architectures (which Anders has suggested may be good for solving some
<br>
types of differential equations).  Its also the only architecture you
<br>
may be able to build in those solar systems that have been strip-mined
<br>
by the roving E.Y. SysOp managed MBrains that need every little bit of
<br>
matter they can cheaply lay their hands on because the can't ever &quot;erase&quot;
<br>
a sentient being...
