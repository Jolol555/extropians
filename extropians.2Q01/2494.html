Hi
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What's so special anyway about countries, about geographic location?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a lot more in common with European Extropians than with the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who live next door.  How does it benefit me for my country to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce its own tin or flax?  What difference does it make if something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is manufactured in Detroit or Dublin?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are we supposed to be patriotic?  To love our country and respect our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaders?  To get a lump in our throat when we see the flag?  I certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope you are not expecting appeals to Jingoistic patriotism to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective here.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'd always thought that extropians would be above such foolish nation-state
<br>
loyalties, and be more &quot;citizens of planet earth&quot; types, but I see such jingoism here so
<br>
often that I'm a permanent lurker.
<br>
<p>I'd recommend working out where your money eventually winds up, and spend accordingly.
<br>
No point supporting local industries if your money is used to fund rainforest clearing
<br>
in south east asia, or arms merchants, etc.
<br>
<p>Not that i actually make such an effort myself, but it's a good way to think about
<br>
spending your money  :-/
<br>
<p>Actually, what is needed is some stores whihc work along the same lines as the ethical
<br>
investment firms they have in australia, where everything sold is amde under safe,
<br>
sustainable, decent conditions, won't harm the environment, etc.  One day.
<br>
<p><p>Dwayne
