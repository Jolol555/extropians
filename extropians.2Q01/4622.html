<p>By BBC News Online technology correspondent Mark Ward 
<br>
A helpful virus is making its way around the web, checking computers for 
<br>
vulnerabilities and closing them. 
<br>
<p><p><p>This code was not written with malicious intent
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Cheesy message  
<br>
The &quot;cheese worm&quot; targets computers running Linux that have been attacked by 
<br>
a similar, but malign, program earlier this year. 
<br>
<p>As it grows in popularity, Linux is increasingly being targeted by virus 
<br>
writers and malicious hackers. 
<br>
<p>But the benevolent program has not been welcomed by anti-virus companies, who 
<br>
say any software that makes unauthorised changes to a computer is potentially 
<br>
dangerous. 
<br>
<p>Roaring worm 
<br>
<p>In March this year, a malicious program known as the Lion worm was infecting 
<br>
Linux servers and installing backdoors that could be exploited by its 
<br>
creators. The worm also stole passwords and sent them to those system 
<br>
crackers using it as an intrusion tool. 
<br>
<p><p><p>The Linux mascot penguin: An increasingly popular target
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The backdoors could be used to stage denial-of-service attacks that use a 
<br>
series of remotely commanded computers to bombard a target server with bogus 
<br>
requests. Usually, the target is overwhelmed by the stream of useless data 
<br>
and either crashes, or becomes unreachable by legitimate users. 
<br>
<p>Although viruses that exploit the weaknesses of Microsoft Windows are by far 
<br>
the most numerous, some malicious hackers have started to target the 
<br>
increasingly popular Linux software. This year, four viruses, the Ramen, 
<br>
lion, Adore and Sadmind/IIS worms, have been written to attack this software. 
<br>
<p>The cheese worm attempts to repair some of the damage done by the Lion worm. 
<br>
It scans networks with certain net addresses until it finds one with a back 
<br>
door, or port, that has been opened by the Lion worm. 
<br>
<p>Wholly holey 
<br>
<p>A port is a logical, as opposed to a physical, division within a computer 
<br>
system. Individual web-aware programs wait for information addressed, or 
<br>
sent, to different ports. These can be thought of as resembling room numbers 
<br>
in a skyscraper, where separate companies reside on different floors inside 
<br>
one physical building. 
<br>
<p>Mail sent to the building will reach the firm it is addressed to, in the same 
<br>
way data sent to a server will be directed to a particular program. 
<br>
<p>If cheese finds a vulnerable computer, it applies a software patch to close 
<br>
the hole, copies itself, and then uses the healed computer to look for other 
<br>
networks with the same vulnerability. 
<br>
<p>The worm may have gone unnoticed but for the zeal with which it scans for 
<br>
vulnerabilities. System administrators who noticed hundreds of attempts to 
<br>
scan their machines went looking for the cause and found the cheese worm was 
<br>
the culprit. 
<br>
<p>The scanning attempts were reported to the Computer Emergency Response Team, 
<br>
which issued a security alert. 
<br>
<p>The program is known as a &quot;worm&quot; because it travels across a network copying 
<br>
itself as it goes. By contrast a &quot;trojan&quot; is a program that looks benign but 
<br>
contains a malicious payload. 
<br>
<p>Comments inside the code for the worm betray its benign intent. 
<br>
<p>One reads: &quot;This code was not written with malicious intent&quot;. The cheese worm 
<br>
claims to have been created: &quot;to stop pesky haqz0rs (hackers) messing up your 
<br>
box even worse than it is already&quot;.
