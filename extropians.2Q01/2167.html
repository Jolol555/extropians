<p><em>&gt;Yes. Religion today that has any hope of retaining credibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restricts itself to completely undisprovable claims. Anything else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is for boobs. Of course, that doesn't say much for most of the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyways... ;)
</em><br>
<p>I find the tendency to be religious to be a fairly easy thing to
<br>
understand.
<br>
<p>For those who don't understand their purpose or place in this
<br>
universe it's only natural to seek it out. Then they have the
<br>
notion of death to consider.
<br>
<p>It's an easy thing at this point to consider that there is
<br>
intelligence behind all this, and that somehow we will survive our
<br>
departing from this world.
<br>
<p>Then along comes somebody with a fairly good self healing tautology
<br>
who say's &quot;Hey check this out! All the answers you need!&quot;.
<br>
<p>Besides we do not know enough about the universe to say with
<br>
certainty that there is not a God. (hence agnosticism)
