<p><em>&gt; Rodenberry was notoriously anti-genetic engineering. One of the classic

<p>This was bound to happen.  In the first place, it is ridiculous to have
<br>
anything as stupid as contemporary humans zooming around the galaxy in star
<br>
ships.  Whatever the future brings, we know it will not be such as that.
<br>
However, Trek is entertainment.  Entertainment has to have an audience who will
<br>
buy it.  If you want to sell product, you need to help the audience identify
<br>
with the characters.  By tiny steps, or by big leaps, genetic engineering is
<br>
going to impact who it is that does make it past this star; you just can't show
<br>
that.
