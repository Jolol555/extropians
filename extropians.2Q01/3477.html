</em><br>
<p>Sure, current languages are broken, but that doesn't mean much: the
<br>
hardware itself is broken, too. It's a vicious circle of the hardware
<br>
albatross hanging upon software's neck, and the other way round. And the
<br>
crew has started dropping, already.
<br>
<p>In fact you don't need all that much to fix the languages, defining a few
<br>
extensions for operations on parallel arrays would do. Fixing hardware is
<br>
harder: we're not that adept at doing computation with matter yet. But
<br>
we're making very good progress. In a few decades we should be able to
<br>
reach the ultimate plateau of what is doable with hardware (i.e. the
<br>
things which go clunk when they fall on your toe).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; possible, building an AI with, say, C or Java, resembles building a castle from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravel with bare hands. We need the kind of tools that allow programming with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts, influences, contexts, weights, levels-of-detail, causes, structures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristics, not instructions, predicates, rules or algorithms.
</em><br>
<p>No. We need something which can twiddle huge amounts of little integers
<br>
very quickly. Because of relativistic latency and fanout limitations you
<br>
will have strong signalling locality. You can't program in an environment
<br>
like this, despite it being provably optimal. Human mind can't handle
<br>
literally billions simultaneous streams of control flow.
<br>
<p>Luckily, you don't have to. You'll define boundary conditions,
<br>
functionality metrics, either formally (we're probably smart enough to do
<br>
that, it will be rather tedious, though), or informally (in an interactive
<br>
teaching session, we're certainly smart enough to do that, in a pinch we
<br>
can hire even a few chimps), and let the system figure out the pattern of
<br>
these little integers, that defines the mapping solving that problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Reusability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An AI is something too complex to be rewritten every few years. It is not just
</em><br>
<p>An AI is something too complex to be written, period. At least explicitly,
<br>
by mere humans. I'm really surprised some people are not yet tired of this
<br>
exercise in futility, slowly but surely reaching epic proportions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the procedures, it's also the knowledge the system has accumulated. This means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all the components will have to be reusable to an unprecedented extent. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea is reusable, but its implementation is not.
</em><br>
<p>You're describing good system design. All very useful, but not for AI.
<br>
Because explicitly coded AI is too hard for monkeys. Says at least this
<br>
monkey.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Hierarchy of computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An AI is not just a program. It's a system that combines the code, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge about the code. Code alone is not introspective. Knowledge about the
</em><br>
<p>An ultimative computing paradigm doesn't make a difference between code
<br>
and data. It's all a sea of seething bits. It has bit patterns, which is
<br>
the system state. Them bits change, and contain state as well as mapping
<br>
from input to output vectors, which sense and do stuff in Real World
<br>
(purportedly, it's out there, somewhere, I never bothered to check).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; code is too inefficient to be interpreted. Given a task, the system recompiles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the important tasks into code that executes quickly. And the code that executes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially often to justify the expenditure of time, can be recompiled into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FPGAs. And every now and then, the system might provide designs for custom chips
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ask the human guardians for them.
</em><br>
<p>A truly smart system designs itself in the bootstrap, and it doesn't need
<br>
slow and stupid &quot;guardians&quot;, at least after significantly into bootstrap
<br>
phase. You do not want anything like this roaming the current landscape.
<br>
It would be literally the end of the world. It might make sense at some
<br>
later point of the game, where there are no monkeys, nor a landscape to
<br>
roam.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Building an AI has proven to be something too complicated for a small team of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people working for a year or two. Perhaps it is better to provide a framework
</em><br>
<p>More, it has proven itself too complicated for thousands groups of teams
<br>
of people working over decades. Perhaps there's a reason for that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that would allow many people to contribute, without breaking the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deductive thought is just one subsystem, other subsystems are spatial thought,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classification, clustering, self-analysis, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I hope you like it in there, where you're sitting. I've been there myself,
<br>
briefly, but thankfully, have gotten better since.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Ecology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Living in the real world requires perception, and artificial perception is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terribly primitive. Until then, it is better to limit the focus of the AI on
</em><br>
<p>Sensorics and motorics are basically solved on hardware level. Guess what,
<br>
it's the software again. And the hardware to run that software.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; software itself. We do not need proper perception: the objective for Seed AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to rewrite and improve itself, while acting in a simple world (computer), where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the environment is disk-space ecology, network geography, CPU food, and user the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God.
</em><br>
<p>We don't need no compilation//we don't need no flow control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * To Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some things have to be done first. Building the framework is the most complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and important item. But we don't yet know how new concepts should emerge, how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with levels-of-detail, how to estimate the reliability of knowledge, how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formally describe ideas, or how to understand and rework software. The problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are at a very fundamental level. They're not philosophical, but require a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introspection, at a relatively mundane level.
</em><br>
<p>Let me figure out the right rules for the integer lattice gas, give me
<br>
enough computronium implementing that particular lattice gas, I/O and
<br>
enough time to play with it. Rather, don't.  We would all die. A real AI
<br>
could clean ruin your day, by eating the world, with you on it. So don't.
<br>
It's that simple.
