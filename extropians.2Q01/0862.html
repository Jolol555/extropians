<em>&gt; Heres where Im going with this.  Using modern technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you had to design a craft with all the same constraints they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had back in 1965, *you would end up with something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks a lot like the space shuttle*.  Beats me how the heck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else you would return big payloads other than a big glider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with rocket engines.
</em><br>
<p>The biggest difference that was considered at the time was integral vs
<br>
expendable propellant tanks.  Had they designed a true RLV instead of
<br>
the desperate kludge that the shuttle was forced to be by arbitrary
<br>
spending caps, the orbiter would have been far larger, but with a lower
<br>
area loading on reentry due to the bulk of the empty tanks.  This would
<br>
have simplified the thermal protection system and lowered the landing
<br>
speed dramatically.  If it were a true two-stage vehicle, the orbiter
<br>
engines could have been optimized for vacuum operation, and the better
<br>
performance of both stages would have *reduced* the dry mass of the
<br>
system for an equivalent payload.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If you had to return just the really expensive bits {motors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and meat}then you might do better, but consider this:  since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good engineer designs around standard parts, the shuttle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designers used the main engines already developed for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saturn V first stage.  The SatV had 5, the shuttle has 3, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were already developed, so they used em.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, the SSME was a new design- and it was clearly the second-best
<br>
design, by the second-best team.  Rocketdyne had better clout and
<br>
connections than Pratt &amp; Whitney, and the standard rumor is that the
<br>
SSME was North American's reward for taking the fall for the Apollo 1
<br>
fire.  The SSME is another engineering horror story in itself...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; By the same reasoning, if we were to develop a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavy lift reusable, we would likely do the math and recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we have an external tank, already developed and being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass produced, economies of scale, so we can buy these things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheeeeapy cheap {as space hardware goes} 33 million bucks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each.  Furthermore, when you actually do the math, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strap on solids make sense too, for all the same reasons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are off-the-shelf parts now.  Good chance it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be cheaper to go ahead and throw away an external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tank than pay the price to have a totally reusable vehicle.
</em><br>
<p>$33 million for a propellant tank is obscene.  For comparison, brand-new
<br>
Boeing 737-700 of similar mass *fully equipped* is only $43 to $51
<br>
million depending on options.  As for the boosters- a pressure-fed
<br>
liquid can be developed for a fraction of the cost of purchasing ten
<br>
sets of solids, would be safer, higher performance, more reliable,
<br>
equally reusable, give the payload a FAR smoother ride (shuttle payloads
<br>
must be designed to take 55 gees RMS due to the damn solids), and not
<br>
release hundreds of tons of HCL per flight- important if flight rates
<br>
are to climb.
<br>
<p>Bottom line: shuttle was, is, and always will be a white-collar jobs
<br>
program, pure pork.  NASA pisses away $14 billion a year, while a real
<br>
commercial RLV will require under $1 billion in investment to develop,
<br>
and will produce an excellent ROI.
<br>

<br>
<p>Read it and weep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These observations lead me to these conclusions: that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a new heavy lift vehicle in the near future {next 20-30 yrs}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will look a lot like the shuttle, with external tank and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solids, and consequently the cost to orbit will not get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dramatically cheaper in that time frame, which means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most promising route for space engineering is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the payloads dramatically more capable, as in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotech.  spike
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  Smaller launchers can become airliner-cheap, and the
<br>
continued lack of demand for heavy lift launch will see to it that no
<br>
non-government vehicle is built for the purpose.  Only if space tourism
<br>
lights off in a big way would new heavy lifters be developed, and they
<br>
would likely be pressure fed liquids to minimize development cost and
<br>
schedule risk.  LOX-kerosene first stage, LOX-hydrogen second stage,
<br>
with the first stage water recovered and the second stage expended or
<br>
salvaged in orbit.  The price per pound would be higher than a good RLV,
<br>
so it would be used only for bulky or high unit mass payloads... and
<br>
with clever design, even a luxury space hotel could be designed to be
<br>
lofted in pieces small and light enough for an RLV.
<br>
<p>I'm putting my money (and time) where my mouth is.  We'll see in a few
<br>
years if I'm correct.
