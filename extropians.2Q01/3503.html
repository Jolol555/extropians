<p>
Now that the dust has settled a bit, can I put forward the suggestion that
<br>
what we saw was an example of a side-effect of the technology being used?
<br>
<p>This thread indicates that both Brian and jm have 'always-on' connection to
<br>
the Web. While this is a 'good thing' for making full use of the Web, it can
<br>
be a disadvantage when used for mailing lists. IMHO the Extropian mailing
<br>
list should be treated with respect as a mailing list and not treated as
<br>
though it was an AOL chat room with lots of one-liner repartee.
<br>
Oops! Now I've got to go and wash my mouth out with soapy water :-(.
<br>
<p>I get the daily digest version of the list which lands once a day in one
<br>
great wodge on my computer, rocking it from side to side as it loses
<br>
momentum. When I read through the list, the effect is like that described in
<br>
the novel 'The Forever War' by Joe Haldeman. The point being that it is very
<br>
difficult to fight an inter-galactic war when the participants are limited
<br>
by light speed and there are huge intervals of time between incident and
<br>
response.
<br>
<p>When I read the daily digest, I am forced to think about what I read, wonder
<br>
about responding, then ten minutes further on in my reading, find that
<br>
several people have responded far better than I could have hoped to respond.
<br>
(You know who you are!).
<br>
<p>When some response offends me I have a quick froth at the mouth, start
<br>
jotting down furious notes in reply and carry on reading. On a good day I
<br>
froth so much that I have to go and have a cold shower after finishing
<br>
reading. By the time I get round to thinking about responding, my furious
<br>
notes are very out-of-date and seem like so much nonsense that I heave a
<br>
sigh of relief that I didn't send them off and make a fool of myself in
<br>
public.
<br>
<p>So, please count to ten before responding - and never send the first draft!
<br>
<p>BillK
