[from cbs.com]
<br>
<p>There are about 1.3 billion Muslims in the world. 
<br>
<p>Their participation in the world's capital markets
<br>
has been hindered because of Islamic laws 
<br>
prohibiting the taking of interest and trading merely 
<br>
for the sake of making money; an investment must 
<br>
have an underlying asset.
<br>
<p>But the Amana Income Fund 
<br>
<a href="http://www.amanafunds.com/advisors.htm">http://www.amanafunds.com/advisors.htm</a>
<br>
invests according to Islamic laws. 
<br>
<p>And now <a href="http://www.islamiq.com/">http://www.islamiq.com/</a> 
<br>
tells world's Muslim population how it can invest.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>The Shari'ah Law (terms, interpretations) 
<br>
<p>&quot;Murabahah&quot; refers to a particular kind of sale where a seller 
<br>
agrees with a buyer to provide a certain amount of profit relative 
<br>
to an initial cost. Everything is disclosed, including the original 
<br>
costs and the profit, which can be a lump sum or percentage. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Musharakah&quot; is an Arabic word meaning &quot;to share.&quot; 
<br>
It's used in business and trade so partners share the profit 
<br>
or loss of a venture. Because interest is prohibited in Islamic law, 
<br>
if a debtor suffers a loss, the creditor can't claim a fixed rate of return 
<br>
or earn a high rate of profit. 
<br>
<p>Shari'ah experts have come up with a &quot;five percent rule&quot; that deems 
<br>
&quot;tolerable&quot; investments in companies that have a maximum level 
<br>
of five percent of non-Shari'ah compliant activities or &quot;tainted income 
<br>
sources.&quot; (Tainted income sources include financial institutions that 
<br>
make or pay interest and companies that have any association with 
<br>
pork products.)
