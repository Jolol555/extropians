I had posed the problem
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 2. A little girl's father discovers that his wife is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pregnant again (but they don't know the sex of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unborn child). The man decides to visit a mathematician. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;I have two children, sir&quot;, he says, &quot;and one of them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is a girl. What is the probability that the other is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a boy?&quot; What did the mathematician tell him? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ***Answers*** For problems 1, 2, and 3, the answer is 2/3.
</em><br>
<p>and Eliezer responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't think your word problems provide the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;priors.  To estimate the probabilities, I would need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know the algorithms used by each of the people making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statements, and that information is not provided.
</em><br>
<p>You're expressing how a statistician would answer.  The father
<br>
didn't take the problem to a statistician, or to any sensible
<br>
person.  He asked the question of a mathematician who plays
<br>
by rules that I discoursed upon in my last post.  Any math
<br>
textbook is riddled by problems that would appear equally 
<br>
problematic from the viewpoint you are advocating.
<br>
<p>Then Eliezer brings up what is apparently a distinct problem:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The &quot;mathematician's daughters&quot; is a much worse instance of the problem. 
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so now the subsets go as follows (I'm still following the
<br>
procedures used by mathematicians):  The set of all parents is
<br>
reduced all the way down to the set of mathematicians with two
<br>
children (at least) one of whom is a girl.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you know that the mathematician will say &quot;At least one of my children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a girl&quot; for BG, GB, and GG, but say &quot;At least one of my children is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boy&quot; only for BB, and the mathematician says &quot;At least one of my children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a girl&quot;, then the probability that the other child is a boy is 2/3.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you know that the mathematician will say &quot;At least one is a girl&quot; for GG,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;At least one is a boy&quot; for BB, and pick a statement at random for BG and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;GB, then the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/2.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe mathematicians would be inclined to mean something different than
<br>
ordinary people would with these statements, maybe not.  But for the
<br>
purposes of a math problem, it's immaterial.  As I said in my last post,
<br>
all that matters is whether the statement &quot;I have two children, and one
<br>
of them is a girl&quot; is true.  In the math problem, we really shouldn't
<br>
make any further hypotheses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've *always* felt that riddle had a problem; now, twelve years later, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;finally get to articulate it.
</em><br>
<p>Which riddle?  The one I asked (about the man whose wife is pregnant
<br>
and who cunningly---or stupidly---goes to a mathematician to talk it
<br>
over and carefully neglects to mention certain information), or the
<br>
&quot;mathematician's daughter&quot; problem that you just posed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(In Lee Corbin's question as stated, I expect that the mathematician
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypothesizes the father to be symmetrical, rather than hypothesizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the father exhibits a feminine bias, and answers 1/2.)
</em><br>
<p>As I say, the mathematician's ideal role is to avoid hypothesizing,
<br>
and I have no idea what &quot;feminine bias&quot; means here.  Given only the
<br>
actual statement that the father made, the answer 1/2 is incorrect.
<br>
