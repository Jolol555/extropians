<em>&gt; Has not the Internet lowered the threshold to become a producer? Sure, it is

<br>
<em>&gt; prevented people from producing and expressing terabytes of stuff...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, something like 1 1/2 terabytes of Usenet text archives were turned over
<br>
by Deja to Google, IIRC (only representing traffic since 1995, and that figure
<br>
presumably doesn't include any indices).
<br>
<p>The question is, how much of this is analogous to &quot;get[ting] drunk at a
<br>
wedding and tapdanc[ing] on the coffee table like Fred Astaire or
<br>
Ginger Rogers. We have a name for [someone who does that].  We call him or her
<br>
an 'exhibitionist.'&quot;
<br>
<p>On the other hand, Clay Shirky claims (in &quot;In Praise of Evolvable Systems&quot;,
<br>
<a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html">http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html</a> )
<br>
&quot;The effects of this ease of implementation... are twofold: a huge increase
<br>
in truly pointless and stupid content soaking up bandwidth; and, as a
<br>
direct result, a rush to find ways to compete with all the noise through
<br>
the creation of interesting work. The quality of the best work on the Web
<br>
today has not happened in spite of the mass of garbage out there,
<br>
but in part because of it.&quot;
<br>
<p>That sounds like a win-win situation ;-&gt; .
