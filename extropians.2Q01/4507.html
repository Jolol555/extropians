<p>If we didn't, we wouldn't be holding this discussion. Maybe our incredible
<br>
strain of luck is about to run out. That proposed time machine thing worries
<br>
me a bit. Of course the rational attitude is &quot;hey, this is SO BIG, it can't
<br>
work. No way!&quot;. But the physics sounds pretty pedestrian, and it says it's
<br>
going to work. Assuming the causality censor mechanism is for real, and 
<br>
we'll get a little energy release which destroys the apparatus, and a little
<br>
excess? Maybe a lot of excess? Like a DIY GRB, or something which literally
<br>
nukes this spacetime?
<br>
<p>In case it really works, do we really want to poke a hole right to end
<br>
of spacetime? Remember, this is not Star Trek. If this is for real, 
<br>
you can't make it go away in the next episode. Sure it's fun if you 
<br>
get modulated Rosetta stone transmissions back which make look Contact like
<br>
a sad joke, but what if God from the end of time makes a little home call, 
<br>
in the flesh? Here's your Rapture for yah, verily, halleluja. Assuming
<br>
&quot;lord, such affairs are hard on the heart&quot; type of experiments become
<br>
commonplace? Sooner or later you might hit the jackpot. Or win the
<br>
nth round of russian roulette. (Okay, I've been bitten by Billie Joy. It's
<br>
time for a little memetic decontamination).

<em>&gt; Maybe not exactly you and me. I'd say we are in for the classic chinese

<em>&gt; &quot;interesting times&quot;, no doubt about it. But extinction? That's a tough one.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but even if we &quot;only&quot; off 80% of us all, that's rather lousy odds.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You know, we haven't even killed ourselves with nukes yet, nor even a really

<p>You can't kill all of us with nukes. If one makes a really large attempt
<br>
at fissioning all available uranium and thorium in open-pit type of reactors 
<br>
(so amateurishly prototyped in the Ukraine), packaging the hot nuclids 
<br>
for optimal atmospheric transport and bioavailability (or vaporising them 
<br>
with a large nuke after the reactor core has burnt out) or whatever
<br>
else Dr. Strangelove would come up with, you could probably eliminate 
<br>
all higher life. It would take decades of preparation and operation, 
<br>
though. Not exactly a garage type operation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; very large proportion of our population. Or with bioweapons. That's either a
</em><br>
<p>Er, we don't have bioweapons worth mentioning. We'll probably have capabilities
<br>
to do some rather fancy stuff in 30 years. We better start working on the 
<br>
realtime pathogen DNA screening infrastructure (aerosol sniffers and mass screening
<br>
of anonymized blood and tissue samples), realtime messaging infrastructure, 
<br>
personal sterile seals and training in their use. A little modernisation of 
<br>
&quot;duck and cover!&quot;. If you catch it early, and clamp down hard with quarantine,
<br>
it's going to fizzle, whether this is a stealthy or a firestorm attack.
<br>
Of course you could lose some 10 k people before you catch it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; damned miracle, or some hint that our crazy world has some kinds of checks

</em><br>
<p>It's a probability thing. The higher the level of tech, the larger the population 
<br>
pool and the longer you wait, the more probable it gets. Yes, space development
<br>
does increasingly look more and more sensible.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Well, heading for the hills wont save you if you are right. Getting off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet is a decent idea... I think a lot of us support getting offworld and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishing something of humanity elsewhere, as a racial backup plan.
</em><br>
<p>Right now making preparations to head for the hills (rather, caves/mines)
<br>
is imo a rather practical, down to earth solution. Just as this guy in
<br>
Australia who's burying large microfiche libraries in places where they
<br>
would last kiloyears. (God bless his little furry feet). One should not 
<br>
discourage diversification. These are purely personal projects of selected 
<br>
fruit- and nutcakes, so they're not even funded with your tax money. Let 
<br>
them. We could be wrong, so they (and their offspring) would have another 
<br>
go at the game.
