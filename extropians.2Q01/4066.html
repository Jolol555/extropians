<em>&gt; Okay.  I accept this result.  I still maintain that almost all the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research that shows up on Eurekalert appears to be politically correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crap,
</em><br>
<p>Eurekalert, as I understand it, presents research for which the researchers
<br>
have released formal press releases.
<br>
Naturally, in the social science domain, this is going to tend to be biased
<br>
toward research with political content or implications.  It's by no means a
<br>
fair sample of social science research.  New theorems discovered in
<br>
mathematical psychology don't tend to merit press releases, for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;but I suppose it's barely possible that the soft sciences aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete intellectual wastelands and that some of its members are slowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straggling into the light of the twenty-first century.
</em><br>
<p>I do think that social science has a far higher ratio of crap than hard
<br>
science.  But I'm not sure this is due to political biases, I think it's due
<br>
to the fact that the data constrains the theories so much less.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than that out of me, you'll have to actually show me a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist doing something right &lt;grin&gt;.
</em><br>
<p>Some EXTREMELY USEFUL social science research has been done on the topic of
<br>
welfare reform, recently.  See my father's papers on the topic, and
<br>
references given therein:
<br>
<p><a href="http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/welfarepage.htm">http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/welfarepage.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The following page contains links to socioeconomic analyses of the recent
<br>
changes in Brazilian economic policy, effected by President Cardoso, which
<br>
have been rather successful [Cardoso is a sociologist and attributes his
<br>
successes in government in part to his understanding of various aspects of
<br>
sociological and economic theory]:
<br>
<p><a href="http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/fhc.htm">http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/fhc.htm</a>
<br>
<p>On a less pragmatic and more theoretical level, one fairly interesting
<br>
subfield of social science is the study of &quot;social networks.&quot;  This subfield
<br>
uses some nice statistics and graph theory, and relates to complex system
<br>
science in various ways.  A bunch of links to resources in this area is
<br>
given in:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/netgroup.htm">http://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/netgroup.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I think this area of research has a lot of potential, but remains moderately
<br>
boring due to its static rather than dynamical focus.
<br>
<p>This is just a random sampling based on my own knowledge and interests.
<br>
There is a lot more out there, believe me.
<br>
<p>In terms of classic anthropology, try reading Colin Turnbull's original
<br>
books on the Mbuti pygmies.  There were some errors there, but also a lot of
<br>
deep observations, regarding such things as the different views of time that
<br>
Stone Age people tend to have, as opposed to industrially or
<br>
post-industrially acculturated people.  I find this stuff quite fascinating,
<br>
more so than Margaret Mead's work by far.
<br>
<p>I won't bother to link to all the high-quality research that exists in
<br>
cognitive, perceptual and social psychology.
<br>
<p>The frustrating thing about social science, to me, isn't that there's no
<br>
high-quality work.  There is lots of it.  It's that the high-quality work
<br>
that's there very rarely addresses the core issues one would like to
<br>
understand about people or societies or economies.
<br>
<p>This is similar to the situation in AI.  It's not that the papers in the
<br>
journal Artificial Intelligence are *bad*.  Most of them are actually quite
<br>
interesting, in themselves.  They just don't tell you much about how to make
<br>
thinking machines!!
