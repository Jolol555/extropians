</em><br>
<p>I think there is a fundamental difference in viewpoints here.  First of all,
<br>
let me say that I don't think that TimeShip is doing this.  That said, the
<br>
notion of &quot;one way is as good as another&quot; is quite contemptable to me.
<br>
There is, and should be, a certain level of integrity which should be
<br>
maintained when dealing with the issue of cryonics.  While it is true that
<br>
making it a &quot;religious temple&quot; would popularize the field as well as bring
<br>
in more money, it would sacrifice far more in the capital of integrity and
<br>
morality than it would gain in monetary returns.  In any business dealing I
<br>
have had so far I have found it immensely important to maintain a level of
<br>
integrity and credibility.  In my current venture, that remains true.
<br>
<p>Though I cannot truly emphasize in words how deeply the concept of &quot;selling
<br>
out for the sake of progress&quot; bothers me (and this isn't a condemnation of
<br>
anyone, but a notion I have observed countless times in the past and
<br>
present), suffice it to say that I would rather see all cryonics
<br>
organizations go belly-up (and the same is true of any technology) than see
<br>
them compromise their integrity and credibility for the sake of gaining new
<br>
members or even furthering the science itself.  The idea is to market
<br>
cryonics effectively *without* trying to make it something it isn't.
<br>
<p>What it is is a possible alternative to death; one which presents a chance
<br>
for extended life that is by no means certain.  The only faith involved is
<br>
the faith (or rather, hope) that technology will advance to such a point as
<br>
to molecularly reconstruct damaged neural (and in some cases, visceral)
<br>
matter.  To put it across as anything else would be deceitful, and though
<br>
&quot;morality&quot; is a subjective concept, it would generally be immoral as well.
<br>
<p>If we can't present something for what it is, then why should we pretend it
<br>
is something it isn't?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely,
