<br>
|&gt; Wow, so much for analysis and prognostication. Basically, the article
<br>
|&gt; suggests that the technological forecasting is always wrong and always
<br>
|&gt; hideously, overly optimistic.

<br>
|I'm afraid this is how I see most of our predictions.  After watching the
<br>
|moon landings, I regularly saw predictions of Moon bases by 1980, Mars bases
<br>
|by 1990, flying cars in the year 2000. AI such as HAL was predicted to be
<br>
|this year, as well as a manned mission to Jupiter.  I really thought I would
<br>
|live to visit other planets, but now that hope seems unlikely unless a major
<br>
|breakthrough in life-extension allows me to go farther into the future.
<br>
<p>In fact, if humans decided they _needed_ a Moon base, they would exist one.
<br>
The technology to go there exists, as the Moon landing demonstrated.
<br>
The technology exists, but not the economics.
