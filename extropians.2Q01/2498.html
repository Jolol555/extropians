Hello,
<br>
<p>There was some recent discussion on this list about the possibility of the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK being the work of militant vegans or eco-terrorists.  I've stumbled across two interesting articles related to this.  While these stories certainly don't prove that the outbreak was intentional, the first one does raise the possibility, and the second shows that the animal-rights extremists don't mind a few dead animals if it scares people away from eating meat.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;- Alleges that a test tube of foot-and-mouth virus disappeared from a government laboratory two months before the outbreak.

- Some quotes from PETA founder Ingred Newkirk regarding foot-and-mouth:
<br>
<p>&quot;If that hideousness came here, it wouldn't be any more hideous for the animals -- they are all bound for a ghastly death anyway. But it would wake up consumers...&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I openly hope that it comes here. It will bring economic harm only for those who profit from giving people heart attacks and giving animals a concentration camp-like existence. It would be good for animals, good for human health and good for the environment.&quot;
