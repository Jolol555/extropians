<p>No need to apologize, we all would have a different opinion of
<br>
any work.  Recall that Chaos was published back when there wasn't
<br>
much out there for the non-specialist in that fascinating field.
<br>
<p>I had high hopes for Faster, but was disappointed.  I thought of
<br>
posting to Gleick and asking him to revise Faster with some
<br>
forward looking perspective.  He makes the point (over and
<br>
over and over) that society was once slow and now we are fast,
<br>
but so what?  Where do we go from here?  Do we stay at
<br>
this pace now?  Will it be like cars, that went from nothing
<br>
to about as fast as they are now in the first 50 yrs, then level
<br>
off?  Jet travel hasnt gotten any faster in my lifetime, in fact it
<br>
has slowed a little to save fuel.  I want extrapolation into the
<br>
future.  Guess thats why I hang out here, eh?  {8^D  spike
