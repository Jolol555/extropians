<p><p>I would be willing to bet against you -- I have very strong doubts that 
<br>
Steven Lehar will ever contribute as much as Einstein did.  Without getting 
<br>
involved in yet another discussion on this, most of this work seems to be 
<br>
based on some rather slippery assumptions that don't always follow.  Every 
<br>
time I read this stuff my BS meter spikes, largely because the definitions 
<br>
of poorly defined words appear to change to suit the argument of the 
<br>
author.  If you nail down all the definitions, the reasoning fails.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a lot of people *have* read the &quot;profound plain and simple logic 
<br>
and rational contained&quot; in those works and found it lacking like I have -- 
<br>
you have to at least consider it.  For me, the lack of a strong argument 
<br>
serves to support my default position that it is not material to anything I 
<br>
need to care about.
<br>
<p>No offense, but you push this stuff like a religious person pushing 
<br>
God(tm).  If I don't believe what you are selling me, the product appears 
<br>
to be a weak argument, therefore the obvious solution (from your 
<br>
perspective) is for me to suspend reason and experience The Truth(tm) so 
<br>
that I can believe.  While convenient for the person selling, it is an 
<br>
absurd proposition to a potential new buyer (essentially being nothing more 
<br>
than a &quot;free&quot; hit on the dealer's crack pipe).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;         By the way, are there any AI people out there working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representation and reasoning about visual 3D data?  I bet if you apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some of Steven's models to an AI visual system, you'd fairly easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get one mondo powerful system with near as much 3D visual common sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;awareness and intelligence as we have!
</em><br>
<p><p>I've read articles about extraordinarily capable non-AI systems that can 
<br>
hypothesize and model complex 3D spaces from 2D input.  The algorithms are 
<br>
there, so it seems that any generic AI could use the data to great 
<br>
effect.  I don't think awareness and knowledge of 3D spaces has any 
<br>
intrinsically special nature.
