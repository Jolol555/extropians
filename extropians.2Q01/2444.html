<p><p>I'll be at the Foresight Institute event this weekend.
<br>
<p>While I have no opinion on whether or not the human mind operates at the 
<br>
quantum level (I am insufficiently knowledgeable to say one way or the 
<br>
other), I don't believe it is mandatory for machine intelligence.  Q-state 
<br>
machine algorithms can generally be implemented on plain old digital FS 
<br>
machines, even if the results aren't as quickly forthcoming.
<br>
<p>As a general question, what part of the mind would seem to require quantum 
<br>
machinery?  I would hesitate to invoke Great Magic simply because we don't 
<br>
have a conventional answer, particularly since not having a conventional 
<br>
answer is caused largely by our ignorance in this case.  I'm not saying 
<br>
that you are incorrect, but that it seems premature at this point to start 
<br>
looking at the mind as a quantum machine, since we can't rule out a boring 
<br>
classical solution; this unnecessary escalation of causality makes me 
<br>
uneasy, as it comes across as the same form of reasoning that likes to 
<br>
attribute everything we don't understand to God/UFOs/Mystical 
<br>
Powers/etc.  Our species has the odd tendency to try and keep the 
<br>
unknowable out of the reach of mere humans, if only in our minds.
