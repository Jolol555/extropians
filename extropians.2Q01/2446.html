<p><em>&gt; Yes. But how is that different from cellular phones? Should cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  phones be regarded as a transhumanizing technology? My answer would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  actually be yes, cellphones change (albeit slightly) what it means to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a human, degeographizing us in an interesting way just as datajacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would dissolve the interface between man and machine.  However, as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  say the reasons people get this technology in are petty and fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  practical. Few people get them as a way of enhancing themselves beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This is where I think SR does not do justice to the possible themes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Instead of exploring the meaning of all these enhancements, how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  human condition is changed by the cyberware (and magic, in this case) it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mostly uses them as &quot;cool powers&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think that's the same reason peopole would get them in real life. 
<br>
&nbsp;Human beings, for the most part, don't deal well with concepts like 
<br>
Ascension, religion, etc.  If and when cyberware becomes common, people will 
<br>
only use it for practical, petty concerns, or to extend thier lives.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool powers, basically.   =)
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;Of course, this is good for the game,
<br>
<em>&gt;  which is after all about action rather than philosophy, but I enjoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  games that really asks these kind of questions in addition to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  action. The problem is of course that few games really do this; this is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  why I'm writing my own scenarios these days. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;   And even in the main book there are the important but often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;neglected or ignored &quot;Skillwires&quot; which let a character plug a chip in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;and they can access a skill from that chip, even if they don't actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;know it. Kind of like borrowed memories, in a way.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This is a technology that would have enormous effects if used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  effectively. A trivial example would be for a corporation to license a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  library of skills, downloading them to linked employees as needed - no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  need for training and in an emergency everybody can become a fireman or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  security guard instantly. Add some coordination through the net, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the secretary pool becomes a formidable opponent for shadowrunners ;-)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe... I just had this mental image of a bunch of harmless looking little 
<br>
secrataries all pushing a button on thier desk when a Shadowrunner walks in 
<br>
an starts waving a gun around and telling them to get on the ground...  and 
<br>
then all the Temp-Hires simultaneously reach under thier desks and pull out 
<br>
automatic weapons...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry.  Silly image.  I play too many 3D shooter games.  =)
