</em><br>
<p>Hmmm. An interesting conflation of viewpoints. While I would certainly agree with
<br>
you that fundamentalist Marxists (or at least people who self-identify as such) have
<br>
an equal propensity for extremism as the other groups you mentioned, I don't think
<br>
Marxists are representative of the left in the US. Most people I know who identify
<br>
themselves as liberal have little knowledge or understanding of Marx (and wouldn't
<br>
care to), and are not anti-technology, anti-reason, or anti-capitalist. Quite the
<br>
contrary. They align themselves more with what I would call standard liberalism--you
<br>
know, like FDR or JFK style liberalism (or at least what they perceive this to be).
<br>
This means they are interested in such &quot;libertarian&quot; issues as freedom from
<br>
oppression, social justice, self-betterment, and having a society that works and is
<br>
safe. This is over-simplified, of course, but my main point is that most ordinary
<br>
citizens who call themselves liberals are far removed from the extremist Marxists
<br>
you are referring to, and always will be. I really believe that the radical leftists
<br>
you refer to in your last sentence are an obnoxious and very loud minority, and I
<br>
can't picture any reasonable liberals being inspired by Kazinski or his ilk. Very
<br>
few people on any part of the political spectrum honestly want to go back to a
<br>
pre-technological way of life (as if that were even possible, or ever has been). I
<br>
don't think Pol Pot is considered to be a good role model by any sane person!
<br>
<p>A question: what exactly is a &quot;right wing libertarian&quot;? This seems contradictory to
<br>
me, since the right wing in the US has always been more interested in maintaining
<br>
social control than promoting liberty (although they pay it incessant lip service).
<br>
Or are you saying that libertarianism has its own political continuum, and there are
<br>
&quot;right wing&quot; and &quot;left wing&quot; and even &quot;moderate&quot; libertarians? This seems
<br>
unnecessarily complicated to me.
