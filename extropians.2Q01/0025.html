<p>I agree with Eliezer about that these are not the best kind of
<br>
critics, but I disagree about that this is due to any lack of
<br>
intelligence or adaptability. 
<br>
<p>The critics we would like to see are the ones that engage in a
<br>
thoughtful, intelligent debate with us about problems and
<br>
possibilities, forcing us to come up with good arguments and
<br>
solutions. The critics we don't need are the ones that we simply don't
<br>
have any common philosophical ground with, that disagree on basic
<br>
values, that have a very different (I would say wrong) conception of
<br>
how economy and technology works and instead of planning to engage in
<br>
debate will be deliberately working to *pre-empt* the debate. If you
<br>
meet the groups Bailey wrote about in a fair debate about facts and
<br>
practical possibilities, you have a good chance of winning against
<br>
them. So they will not go for that kind of debate, they will win much
<br>
more by creating a polarized situation or by scaring politicians into
<br>
thinking that nanotechnology is some kind of child abuse. They did it
<br>
quite well with genetic engineering in Europe.
