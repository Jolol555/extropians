<p>I don't think that is a good model.  The Brownian motion aspect
<br>
of reversible computation is a way to use the latent heat in
<br>
material to drive forward a computation.  For example all chemical
<br>
reactions are inherently reversible.  You can eliminate adding extra
<br>
heat to a reaction by using the latent heat in the environment and the
<br>
fact that the probability distribution of the energy of individual molecules
<br>
will mean that some of them will have more than the required activation
<br>
energy to drive the reaction forward.  However you may have to wait
<br>
a long time to get significant numbers of molecules to go through
<br>
the transition state.  You still lose energy here because the
<br>
product molecules have to give the transition-state energy back
<br>
to the environment.
<br>
<p>The Fredkin/Toffoli &quot;billiard ball&quot; reversible computation model is
<br>
a better analogy.   The real point you have to understand is that
<br>
it isn't how you do the computation (you can do the computing for *free*
<br>
(e.g. Brownian motion as a driver)) -- its whether or not you erase
<br>
bits!  The is the very counterintuitive result of all of the physics
<br>
of computation work done by Landauer, Bennett, et al.
<br>
<p>So when you do reversible computation you must save all the intermediate
<br>
states and then roll them back to their original state after you have
<br>
computed your result.  The majority of the heat you produce using this method
<br>
is produced in the erased bits of the final result (there are of course
<br>
some losses in all the intermediate steps and the trick will be getting these
<br>
to the smallest levels possible).
<br>
<p>I believe Michael Frank has a paper that determines the size a reversible
<br>
computer must be to trump any non-reversible computer (its *very* big).
<br>
<p>What isn't clear is whether you are always going to pay a &quot;real time&quot;
<br>
penalty by shifting to reversible computation (note that Eric's
<br>
rod-logic reversible computers only function ~1 GHz and we will probably
<br>
be pushing 10-15GHz in non-reversible architectures before we make
<br>
the transition to reversible architectures).  Of course what you
<br>
sacrifice in &quot;real time&quot; you get back (several times over) in parallelism.
<br>
<p>Now, of course the interesting thing about this is that if you are
<br>
always saving the &quot;intermediate&quot; states of your consciousness in this
<br>
very long reversible computation and you get the results and do a
<br>
roll back it seems in some strange way that you have killed all the
<br>
copies...
<br>

<br>
<p>(Also, if anyone tries to get to my site (www.aeiveos.com) and ends up
<br>
at a site that seems to be in France, could they please let me know
<br>
off-list; I seem to be having some very strange DNS problems and can't
<br>
quite figure out if its me or the net.)
