<p>There's always been a strain of this in _Trek_, starting with
<br>
the original 1966 version.  In the original series, we had evil
<br>
(or at least soulless) uploads -- the android-ized Roger Korby
<br>
in &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;,  the uploaded social
<br>
philosopher Landru in &quot;Return of the Archons&quot;; we've had the
<br>
single-minded anti-life AI &quot;Nomad&quot; in &quot;The Changeling&quot;, and the
<br>
insane AI (which was in fact a reverse-engineered human brain
<br>
transcribed to an inorganic substrate): Dr. Richard Daystrom's
<br>
&quot;M-5&quot; in &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;; and we've had megalomaniacal
<br>
genetically-enhanced humans: Khan Noonian Singh and his cronies
<br>
in &quot;Space Seed&quot; (and in the future history revealed in this
<br>
episode, there were &quot;eugenics wars&quot; on Earth in the 1990's).
<br>
<p>And wasn't there an episode of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ that
<br>
revealed that Dr. Julian Bashear owed his obnoxiously high IQ to
<br>
illegal (in the Federation) genetic manipulation, and that he lied
<br>
about it to get into Star Fleet?
<br>
<p>Of course, we've also had _Star Trek: The Next Generation_'s
<br>
Lt. Commander Data, friendly AI and Pinocchio wannabe, whose
<br>
freedom as a sentient being was defended in Star Fleet court by
<br>
Captain Picard when a representative of the Daystrom Institute
<br>
wanted to claim him as government property.
<br>
<p>Gene Roddenberry, for all his spaceship technophilia, was a
<br>
champion of humans vs. the machine.  Also, TV shows are a form
<br>
(however debased) of literature, and they're produced and written
<br>
by people with liberal arts and humanities backgrounds (and
<br>
somewhat left-wing political biases), not scientists and
<br>
engineers.  _Trek_, and SF in general, has often taken a skeptical,
<br>
dyspeptic attitude toward the rush to Singularity.
<br>
This is not necessarily a bad thing, IMO.
