</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Programmed?  No, not programmed.  A Sysop is a Friendly superintelligence
<br>
that has decided Friendliness is best served by a Sysop Scenario.  Under
<br>
pressures sufficient to break the Sysop Scenario - which really would
<br>
require an Elysium-type catastrophe, something totally implausible and
<br>
Eganic - the Sysop stops being a Sysop and starts being a Friendly
<br>
superintelligence that has now rejected the Sysop Scenario as failing to
<br>
maximize Friendliness.  And you can leave in your Eganic lifeboat,
<br>
Sysop-free, if you wish; perhaps torture and child abuse will re-enter the
<br>
Universe, but by hypothesis, the alternative was total extinction.
<br>
<p>And if the Sysop Scenario turns out to be unnecessary in the first place,
<br>
I'd expect a Friendly superintelligence to spot that as well - or rather,
<br>
simply never arrive at the Sysop Scenario as a conclusion.  The Sysop
<br>
Scenario is my prediction because it is a consequence of Friendliness
<br>
given my model of reality; the Sysop Scenario is *not* intrinsic to
<br>
Friendliness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This smells like the sort of thing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually sent HAL round the bend.  What if the Sysop starts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get a little dotty?  Egan imagined something unforeseen like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this happening in Elysium, when the Lambertians got smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to TOE the Elysians out of existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So here are some concrete things that you might want to do that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop might or might not permit.  Could you gain direct control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your own computronium (and go hang yourself with it, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted) by forking off your own universe and leaving the Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the other clients irrevocably behind?  Could you and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend go through the same escape hatch together?  Could the clients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unanimously decide to leave together and ditch the Sysop entity?
