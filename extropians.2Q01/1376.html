Yesterday Science came out with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Astronomers Glimpse Galaxy's Heavy Halo
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2001/322/2">http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2001/322/2</a>
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct Detection of Galactic Halo Dark Matter 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1059954">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1059954</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(The second URL may require a subscription)
<br>
<p>The abstract is:
<br>
<em>&gt; The Milky Way Galaxy contains a large, spherical component which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believed to harbor a substantial amount of unseen matter.  Recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations indirectly suggest that as much as half of this &quot;dark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter&quot; may be in the form of old, very cool white dwarfs, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remnants of an ancient population of stars as old as the Galaxy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself. We have conducted a new survey to find faint, cool white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dwarfs with large space velocities, indicative of their membership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Galaxy's spherical halo component. The survey reveals a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantial, directly observed population of old white dwarfs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too faint to be seen in previous surveys. This newly discovered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population accounts for at least 3% of the halo dark matter. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides a natural explanation for the indirect observations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and represents a direct detection of Galactic halo dark matter. 
</em><br>
<p>Now, the theoretical physicists have &quot;proven&quot; from known observations
<br>
and a very complex theory, that I do not claim to comprehend, that the
<br>
White Dwarfs cannot account for &quot;most&quot; of the Dark Matter.  However
<br>
the White Dwarf &quot;fans&quot; (presumably including the authors of the above
<br>
article) want to argue that they may constitute a &quot;significant&quot;
<br>
fraction.  How you read &quot;3%&quot; is of course debatable.  The article
<br>
&quot;pushes&quot; the idea that this is a lower limit.  Other constraints
<br>
based on the MACHO and EROS experiments suggest the high limit
<br>
may be 35%.  (What's an order of magnitude among friends...).
<br>
<p>However a careful read of the paper provides two very interesting
<br>
quotes:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Two of the 38 new cool white dwarfs have unusual spectra (Fig. 2B).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, LHS 1402, has a spectrum very similar to those of the peculiar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars LHS 3250 (5,7) and SDSS 1337+00 (6), but with a steeper
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slope towards longer wavelengths, suggesting a *cooler* temperature.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other object, WD2356-209, possesses a bizare spectrum,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*incomparable* to any other known object.  We reanalyzed the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data on this object several times and found no evidence for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residual instrumental effects.&quot;
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We still do not understand the nature of the three strange objects
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LHS 3250, LHS 1402 and SDS 1337+00 (5-7), all of which lie at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R59F - I_N colors near -0.5 (well outside of Fig. 4).  The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kinematics of these stars, with the exception of LHS 1402, suggest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they may be disk objects.  While they are certainly(?) white
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwarfs, we know neither their effective temperatures nor their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atmospheric compositions.  They may represent another, perhaps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unusual, stage in the spectral evolution of cool white dwafs.&quot;
<br>
<p>[Emphasis *...* and (?) mine.]
<br>
(Fig. 4 contains a plot of the 'real' white dwarfs when measured
<br>
by two different optical characteristics).
<br>
<p>The paper provides the spectrum of WD2356-209 and LHS-1402 and
<br>
they are very very different from the other spectra they show
<br>
from what they claim are 'valid' cool white dwarfs.
<br>
<p>Now personally, I cannot imagine any artificial structures that
<br>
would match the spectra of these two objects.  But its
<br>
pretty clear from the comments that the astronomers are having
<br>
a hard time matching any 'natural' phenomena to go with them as well.
<br>
Since they are dealing with only ~10% of the sky, this would
<br>
argue there are a couple of dozen &quot;objects&quot; within our observing
<br>
range that don't fit known stellar models.  { They were using the
<br>
4m V.M. Blanco Telescope and we have telescopes 2.5x as large. }
<br>
Expect the plot to get thicker as references 6&amp;7 (which are
<br>
still in press) become available.
<br>
<p>What is interesting about this is that it seems when the
<br>
astronomers see something they don't expect, they go back
<br>
and check the instruments... :-)  I wonder if the SIs think
<br>
of the astronomers as rats running a maze trying to find the
<br>
cheese...
