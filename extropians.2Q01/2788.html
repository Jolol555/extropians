Wow, what a convenient set of definitions, gee-whiz...
<br>
<p>And, yeah--these would be the big-headed bulging black eyed guys. 
<br>
I'll bet they have a really neat set of definitions to suit their own 
<br>
ends, as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the false comfort of a moral high ground. It's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones who believe in an absolute morality that have done the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harm, historically.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps; if not entirely true, certainly very close. The world is now 
<br>
a different place, however, and religion is not a significant force 
<br>
for first-world change.
<br>
<p>Can there be such a thing as absolute morality? I do not claim to 
<br>
know. Is there such a thing as morality? Yes. Is morality a useful 
<br>
concept? Perhaps. Do I value persons possessed of it more than 
<br>
persons not so possessed? You bet.
<br>
<p>I shall at this point invoke Einstein, Oppenheimer, and Dyson--who 
<br>
came to realize that the consequences of the scientific endeavor have 
<br>
become such that the scientist can no longer claim to stand apart 
<br>
from his/her works--and the uses to which those works are put. This 
<br>
was a realization of the value of morality--in each case brought 
<br>
about by The Bomb.
<br>
<p>Greater dangers loom, and those right soon.
