<p>Arrr, while I don't mind being mislabeled as pessimist (hey, somebody

has got to do it), I'm absolutely, utterly innocent of below 
<br>
misattribution. In fact I'm absolutely on your side in this particular
<br>
tussle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We can structurally modify plants, a bit, but nothing like the

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah Eugene, you have to work *across* technologies as well as in depth!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You use external site-management lasers driven by the blueprint that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interact with highly specific photoantenna complexes within the cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in turn are tied to the signal transduction pathways for &quot;divide&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;commit apoptosis&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That should allow you to control the shape of your new house to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within 10-20 micron accuracy -- much better than human workers!
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this. Not that I *need* my house to be grown within 
<br>
20 um precision (or even a dm precision, as long as it on the fiber
<br>
optics feed), mind, but I don't mind  at all. As long as it doesn't 
<br>
smell, and I don't get icky slime oozing down the walls, or a case
<br>
of crawling bugs I'm perfectly content.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You only have to tinker with 20 transfer RNA's and proteins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give your house an entirely different genetic code.  I
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you also have to modify proteins beyond 
<br>
metabolizability. While not impossible, it's hard. And 
<br>
the parasites do adapt. You can make it hard, by 
<br>
using C60 and B12 clusters for amino acid residues, and weirder
<br>
things still, but you still have to use the peptide
<br>
bond. Unless you go totally wild, and make something
<br>
out of this world, but it's going to run into compatibility
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; suspect making stop codons out of the most common amino
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acid triplets will put a real dent into Nature trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to turn your house into lunch.  Its also going to have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get pretty inventive as well if the non-growing surfaces are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely coated with abalone shell.
</em><br>
<p>Someone just whispered &quot;Elizabeth Hand&quot; into my ear here, 
<br>
but I have no idea why. See you after the next rain of roses.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Presumably you handle the nitrogen problem in ways similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to those used by the nitrogen fixing bacteria.  Probably
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but these need to be fed. So you need to recognize
<br>
a deficit, and compensatingly act upon the deficit by 
<br>
supplying extra nutrients to a symbiont, while keeping 
<br>
the parasites of the back of the compleat assembly... 
<br>
While doable, it's not trivial. Gardening might be fun, 
<br>
it's not my idea of spending the bulk of my waking time 
<br>
remotely catering to engineered growing structures.
<br>
<p>And please don't tell me you expect to grow spacegoing vessels
<br>
that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; several layers under the surface cells in a relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anaerobic environment with transporters for exporting fixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nitrogen to the aerobic cells.  I'm sure you can do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arithmetic on the mass of the house and the mass of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential elements needed.  I suspect its probably in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vicinity of a pickup truck load or less.  You can probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gain a lot by programming in the nutrient export methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trees use in the fall.  It would be interesting to see if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those cells completely reverse the micronutrient flow from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importing to exporting.  If you can restrict the micronutrient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs to the growing surfaces only, I suspect the micronutrient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass requirements will be very low.
</em><br>
<p>Vewy, vewy intewestink. Whenever the producer for the next alternative
<br>
reality script will return my call I'm going to plug in above
<br>
paragraph for extra fun. No royalties for you, sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do agree however that the medical applications will probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capture the imagination of researchers long before the construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry is revamped.
</em><br>
<p>Dirty, dirty Tleilaxu. You should give the Ixians at least some
<br>
chance to unfold their particular magic, before walking all over
<br>
them.
