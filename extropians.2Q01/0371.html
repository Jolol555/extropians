I wrote
<br>
&quot;But, the fewer the genes the easier monster production will be, don´t you
<br>
think so?&quot;
<br>
<p>I appreciate replies from  Jeff Davis and Eugene.Leitl, particularly
<br>
&quot;transrodent conspiracy&quot; new concept. I think philosophy is the new concepts
<br>
creation. Not so bad, Jeff.
<br>
<p>Possibly, if genes are fewer, it means greater body codification by each one.
<br>
It makes difficult to predict how this complex network of interactions with
<br>
react.  Hazard has lead evolution, how we will stop it?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, is this dreamed evolution for all people, or do we have to
<br>
consider more than one human specie, as when we share with Neanderthals, and
<br>
possibly help to their extintion?
<br>
<p>Or it is been considered from now on?: &quot;What is it that societies as disparate
<br>
as those we find in Colombia, Nigeria and Burma have in common that has held
<br>
them back from the benefits of real modernism? Why have attempts to aid
<br>
development in these  countries proved so ineffective for so long? &quot;
<br>
<p>What real modernism is? Do you really know what US aids here in Colombia is
<br>
for?
<br>
<p>Any serious commentary, gentlemen?
<br>
<p>PD: I am preparing a draft paper on actual trends in evolution, and like to
<br>
consider points like these:
<br>
- A hundred years from Mendel´s work revisited by de Vries and others and the
<br>
completion of the human genome sequence, is not a good prospect.
<br>
- Some sudamerican tribe demands for his blood taked by  genome project´s
<br>
people. Like this Argentinean who, at divorce time, asked for the kidney he
<br>
gave to his wife.
<br>
- Projects as robots´screen saver may apart us from their reproduction
<br>
process
<br>
- Biological viruses has functions: to find a host, to alter information
<br>
status, to replicate. Program viruses are the same. When we will have an
<br>
interfase with them?
<br>
- When a pilot seats in front a flight simulator, who is learning at all?
