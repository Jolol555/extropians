of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Althought it no longer reflects my opinions about future growth rates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/fastgrow.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/fastgrow.html</a> offers a simple model adequate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Interest rates should equal a preference discount rate plus a factor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proportional to the growth rate in consumption.  If productivity rises
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faster, consumption will rise faster, and so interest should be higher.
</em><br>
<p>That's the supply-side.But isn't there a demand-side effect too?  If global 
<br>
productivity rises more quickly, that should bump up global discount rates 
<br>
as well.  This will result in given marginal investments becoming undesirable 
<br>
and pushing down the demand curve.  That would actually reduce rates.  
<br>
The net effect would depend on the slopes of the supply and demand curves, 
<br>
right?
<br>
(As well as complicated results on discount rates, since a rich capitalist 
<br>
will
<br>
no change *his* discount rate due to labor productivity - he makes money 
<br>
from capital; his labor is negligible.  If *all* investment came from such 
<br>
people then I think effects would be as Robin describes.)
<br>
<p>What happens if the market is wrong about
<br>
long-term productivity?  30-bonds obviously entail an consensus assumption 
<br>
that productivity growth will remain decided pedestrian for that period.
<br>
Rates don't go up until people realize productivity will continue to increase.
<br>
<p>(I'm assuming John's referring to labor productivity.  If capital productivity
<br>
goes up, that's  a direct increase in the value of investments and more 
<br>
reason to expect a increase in interest rates.)
