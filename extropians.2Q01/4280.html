</em><br>
<p>I think that Spike has nailed it   :-)
<br>
<p>Perhaps the reason is the following.  Laughable optimism
<br>
characterizes the possible developments that are easy to
<br>
see coming.  So it was laughably optimistic, for example,
<br>
to believe that flying cars were immanent.
<br>
<p>But in the long term, developments that couldn't have been
<br>
foreseen are the ones that dominate.  And that's why the
<br>
long term prognostications are laughably pessimistic.

<p><em>&gt;Do you notice that the top grandmasters are no longer

</em><br>

<em>&gt;these days.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't realize that they were no longer reporting
<br>
their results.  But regardless, any grandmaster today
<br>
can still reliably beat any commercial software.
