<p>Well, I'm glad that someone understands the difference between the shock
<br>
troops that take the beach and the stolid regular army that follows in,
<br>
mops up resistance, builds fortifications, and holds the beach.  I can't
<br>
help but think that you're underestimating the importance of the shock
<br>
troops, though.  Sure, it could be that, without Einstein, General
<br>
Relativity would have been invented anyway, just five years or twenty
<br>
years later.  But you'll never know because there *are* Mozarts in this
<br>
world, people who are more than moderately gifted, and these are the
<br>
people who wind up actually taking the beaches most of the time.  Just as
<br>
you'll never know whether the scientific Mozarts are perfectly capable of
<br>
filling in all the blank spaces left behind, because there's always
<br>
another beach, and so few Mozarts to take it...
<br>
<p>And sometimes, twenty years or even five years makes a BIG difference.
