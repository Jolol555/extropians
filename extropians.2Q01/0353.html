<em>&gt; The plaque is inside 
</em><br>
<p>Spike, I might have been misinformed. Mir's mildewy interior is well
<br>
known.
<br>
I dug for URLs and couldn't find any report of the stuff growing
<br>
outside. Sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also Anders was looking at travelling to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asteroids, so atomic oxygen would not be an issue.
</em><br>
<p>Unclear. I'm not sure how quickly overboard O2 gets radicalized. But the
<br>
point I was trying to make is now in the &quot;moot point&quot; region.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The boredom factor is one I have been considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for some time however, especially because of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wacky notions that the first colonist may be going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone.  We need some kind of really advanced VR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to keep her lonely mind engaged and entertained.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Keep her from going overbored, eh?
