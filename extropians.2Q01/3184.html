&quot;Joe Dees&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect sir,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This fellow who is being interviewed really should
<br>
sit in a blot or raise a horn in sumbel. Or at least
<br>
Not look into the issue of the Elder Troth reeking of
<br>
a hundred preconceptions.  This sort of thing is half
<br>
the reason most of us who read the Havamal with reverence
<br>
and respect don't even mention it around others.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I may be wrong but I am assuming you see some truth by
<br>
forwarding this post to the list. If not I feel you should
<br>
have so noted. Just my NSHO.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the rest of the list,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Troth (to give it a respectful name, much like referring
<br>
to Quakers as &quot;Friends&quot;) is hardly the sort of antiquarian
<br>
mongrel of hate and mysticism this article would make out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike many people with deep &quot;reverence&quot; for nature by
<br>
and large the Troth is deeply focused on things like autonomy,
<br>
private/family property, and inner strength.  Moreover nature
<br>
is a both a scource of survival, and a resource humans must
<br>
use to live. But shouldn't spoil lest we shan't be able to use
<br>
it anymore. Not so &quot;radical&quot; I think.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who think otherwise should ponder the meaning of the
<br>
timeless metaphor of self-sacrifice for knowledge, inherent
<br>
in the Ordeal at Yggdrasil. And think about uploading.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll lay off. Just thought I'd let everyone hear a stray voice
<br>
calling a foul story just that.
<br>
<p>regards
<br>
