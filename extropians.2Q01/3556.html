<p>Its me.  Hey, I get along with everybody.  Ive been quietly watching
<br>
this latest list quality thread and wish to add only a little.  Extropians
<br>
<p>is a forum for exchange of ideas about the future, and it is also an
<br>
ongoing party of sorts.  Many pleasant acquaintances in RL start
<br>
here.  The banter does get loud at times, as it does at a party, but
<br>
that is part of the delightful charm and strangeness of the list.
<br>
<p>Extropians has spun off a number of parallel processes, so to
<br>
speak, such as Eliezer's SL4, Mike Lorrey has organized
<br>
two or three specializations, theres the Exi-freedom list, the
<br>
local ExI lists, et.al.  Some of these specialty lists are more
<br>
suited to certain special-interest readers.
<br>
<p>Extropians is a live and let live kinda place, broad and perfectly
<br>
suited to the future minded libertarian.  Yes it gets noisy,
<br>
yes flame wars break out.  Get a quick finger on the
<br>
delete key.  We are about life extension, eh?  What good
<br>
is a longer life if we aren't having fun?  Lets get together
<br>
at E5 and slam a brew or two and let the flames be
<br>
bygones.  spike
