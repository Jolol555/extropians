<em>&gt;You make a huge assumption with the consistency assumption, that a prior is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;... you assume that all priors are extremely well founded.  An easy example
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where this is false is that the uberprior offers two possible priors (25% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Q vs. 75% of Q) and a 50% chance of Q, regardless of assigned prior.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another way of stating it is that you effectively assume everybody has the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational for John and Mary to update their beliefs on each other's priors;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the differences between their priors results only from good Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inference on honest data.  But that is not my experience of priors, at all;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as far as I can tell, they're pretty random even where humans should have

</em><br>
<em>&gt;chemisty. ... the restriction is generally false in the real world; ...
</em><br>
<p>I was making a *normative* argument about rational beliefs, not a descriptive
<br>
model of actual beliefs.  Yes, people disagree, and that can't be explained
<br>
by assuming people are Bayesians with the same priors.  That has been the
<br>
whole point of this discussion.  I argue that not all possible priors are
<br>
rational -- rational priors should be obtained from &quot;uberpriors&quot; via
<br>
conditioning.  I do *not* assume that everyone has the same uberprior,
<br>
actually, but I do describe plausible constraints on such uberpriors that
<br>
imply common priors.
