If the laws of physics as we know them today are correct, then
<br>
&quot;this&quot; has to be a simulation, yet in addition also has to be the
<br>
real thing.
<br>
<p>First, the denotation &quot;this&quot; is a pointer, but a pointer to more
<br>
than one instance.  The instances need not be completely
<br>
identical, but merely indistinguishable from some perspective. For
<br>
an elementary example, you (a) can't be certain that your brain
<br>
isn't in a jar in Moscow, nor (b) be certain that (in the
<br>
simulation in which you are reading this) there is nothing beyond
<br>
the walls of your room, nor (c) can be certain that this isn't the
<br>
conventional &quot;real thing&quot;, nor, most importantly, can you be sure
<br>
that not all three are true at once!
<br>
<p>I believe that all three are true by necessity.  If you haven't
<br>
read it already, then I strongly suggest that you examine David
<br>
Deutsch's &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;.  As everyone should know, David
<br>
Deutsch, who is a founder of quantum computation, makes a case for
<br>
MWI that cannot be ignored.
<br>
<p>Although his book is filled with a number of suggestive phrases,
<br>
what is missing---and what perhaps no one has yet supplied---is a
<br>
quasi-mathematical model that enables us to coherently speak about
<br>
the many-worlds, and the overall density or probability of events
<br>
in the multiverse.  We are left with equating &quot;improbable&quot; with
<br>
&quot;has a low density or measure among the many-worlds&quot;.  In fact, I
<br>
have recommended for many years the &quot;Many Worlds Normalization
<br>
Principle&quot;, which says that there are almost no moral or
<br>
psychological consequences that follow from one's realization that
<br>
one's self is really multiple copies living in multiple worlds.
<br>
<p>Robin Hanson pointed out to me in 1989 the first of just a few
<br>
exceptions to the Many Worlds Normalization Principle that I know
<br>
of.  His exception we call &quot;you can't beat the odds&quot;, which
<br>
refers, for example, to the  following scenario: if the a priori
<br>
odds of something bad happening to you are .9, then even after
<br>
you've experienced the .1 escape, you must still admit that in
<br>
most worlds, the bad thing happened to you anyway.
<br>
<p>Regarding the simulation that we are living in:  if it is a
<br>
simulation, then it is identical to an actual sheaf of worlds in
<br>
which the situation arose by the usual laws of physics unmediated
<br>
by any simulator.  Since these are identical from your
<br>
perspective, you might as well regard yourself living in a real
<br>
world; but it's equally true that you are living in simulations
<br>
too.  I think that Nick Bostrom's calculations in
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/Simulation.doc">http://www.nickbostrom.com/Simulation.doc</a> are correct, or at least
<br>
the spirit behind them is correct, because each of the other
<br>
worlds also has a propensity to develop simulation techniques.
<br>
(This is an example of the Many Worlds Normalization principle:
<br>
in this case, the existence of many worlds does not change the
<br>
quantitative picture.)
<br>
<p>What does change is that regardless of all the simulations, you
<br>
are living in a bottom-level reality too.
