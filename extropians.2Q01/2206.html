</em><br>
<p>Has not the Internet lowered the threshold to become a producer? Sure, it is 
<br>
hard to get a big economic payback for producing on the net, but that has not 
<br>
prevented people from producing and expressing terabytes of stuff. If I want, 
<br>
I can always publish my paintings or poetry or philosophy on the net. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it has been my own observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there's a **vast** pool of untapped talent in the world, far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than can squeeze into the top of any social pyramid, and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback that that the top .0001% exert on the other 99.9999% suppresses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that potential **until** there's a need for one of the .0002 percenters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to step forward.  And so on down the line.
</em><br>
<p>Also, a lot of the &quot;untapped&quot; potential is really tapped, but locally and 
<br>
privately. I think few people are totally uncreative and unwilling to do 
<br>
anything for themselves - it is just that they seldom show their products to 
<br>
others. When you start to examine what people do, you find that there is a 
<br>
lot going on that is not seen officially.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I've even seen this in **myself**!  I was in a meeting at work a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago at which nobody seemed to be taking the lead and asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pertinent questions, and after listening to this for a few minutes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I got up, went to the whiteboard, and took charge (without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked, a **most** uncharacteristic thing for me to do).  Afterwards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the manager who had nominally been running the meeting came up, **thanked**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me for taking over, and added something along the lines of &quot;I didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you had it in you&quot;, to which I replied (to myself, at least), well, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't usually **have** to, but **somebody** had to do it this time!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it changes your head to be involved in a situation like that --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alters the wash of neurotransmitters, heightens the testosterone, ramps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up the neuromodulators, and burnishes up the synapses!  Gives a Gamma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a taste of what it would be like to be a Beta or even an Alpha
</em><br>
<p>I would say the lesson is also that you can take this role. Being an Alpha is 
<br>
not predetermined as in in Huxley's book, but something you can take on. 
<br>
Sure, there are good leaders around, but you could become one of them too by 
<br>
taking charge. With more training you would be a good leader all the time, 
<br>
but the basic self identification as a leader has to appear first. 
<br>
<p>I did this with public speaking - I *had to* speak in front of my entire 
<br>
school many years back. I did, did a passably funny job, and has since then 
<br>
become very used to public speaking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what does this communication feedback effect portend for life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the Singularity, I wonder? 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think communication is a stratifying tool. I think the feeling of 
<br>
being a beta and hence forced to be silent is more of an old holdover of 
<br>
primate dominance hierarchies, something we can abolish. In a world with good 
<br>
content filtering, good ideas are good ideas and the originator will be given 
<br>
due respect. The lesser lights have their chance even when Homer is not 
<br>
sleeping - because Homer doesn't *always* write Illiads and Odysseys, and 
<br>
from time to time one of the Salieris has a better idea. Then it doesn't 
<br>
matter if any of the involved are borganisms, solitary SIs, Culture Minds or 
<br>
even baseline humans.
