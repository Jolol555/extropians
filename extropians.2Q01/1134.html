<p>
Both the American Civil Liberties Union and The American Library 
<br>
Association filed suit 3-20-2001 in Federal court to stop the 
<br>
Children's Internet Protection Act (CHIPA).  This is the act that 
<br>
forces libraries and schools to use filtering software (censorware). 
<br>
You can read both complaints here:
<br>
<p>ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/court/multnomah.pdf">http://www.aclu.org/court/multnomah.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>ALA <a href="http://www.ala.org/cipa/cipacomplaint.pdf">http://www.ala.org/cipa/cipacomplaint.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>Filtering software has been pushed as the solution to stopping 
<br>
children from viewing inappropriate materials, like pornography, on 
<br>
the Internet.  However, the software has numerous flaws, the most 
<br>
basic being that it doesn't stop all of the pornography.  More 
<br>
ominously, and more of a threat to our long term liberty is the fact 
<br>
that the software in many cases &quot;blacklists&quot; political and other 
<br>
material incorrectly.  Seth Finkelstein, who just won the Electronic 
<br>
Freedom Foundation's Pioneer Award, details a few gun related sites 
<br>
that are blacklisted.  If a school or library had the SmartFilter 
<br>
program installed, students would be blocked from viewing those 
<br>
sites.  As a point of information-  <a href="http://www.ayoob.com">http://www.ayoob.com</a> which is 
<br>
listed as &quot;extreme&quot; is the site run by the noted Police firearm's 
<br>
Instructor Massad Ayoob.  The site is His Lethal Force Institute, 
<br>
which trains qualified citizens and police in armed self defense 
<br>
techniques.  The other sites, are listed under the category of 
<br>
criminal skills.  <a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com">http://www.springfield-armory.com</a> is the site for 
<br>
Springfield Armory an American producer of fine firearms.  My 
<br>
recommendation is that everyone enter their favorite site's url at: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.securecomputing.com/cgi-bin/filter_whereV3.cgi">http://www.securecomputing.com/cgi-bin/filter_whereV3.cgi</a>  and see if 
<br>
their site or company is blocked.  Then I'd take whatever action, 
<br>
including the courts to have the incorrect designation removed.

Subject: Gun activists have a stake against censorware
<br>
<p>[Feel free to forward to your list]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, the groups ACLU/ALA/PFAW will be filing a
<br>
lawsuit against the Federal censorware law (CIPA). It's important to
<br>
understand that the reach of censorware extends to far more than sex.
<br>
Anyone who can be the target of a secret blacklist has a stake.  As a
<br>
small illustration, a quick check shows the censorware program
<br>
SmartFilter blacklists many gun-related sites under the category of
<br>
&quot;Criminal Skills&quot;:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.gun-room.com">http://www.gun-room.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.gungarage.com">http://www.gungarage.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.gun-tests.com">http://www.gun-tests.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.guns.com">http://www.guns.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.gunsamerica.com">http://www.gunsamerica.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncggasgun.com">http://www.ncggasgun.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.championfirearms.com">http://www.championfirearms.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.springfield-armory.com">http://www.springfield-armory.com</a>
<br>
<p>And <a href="http://www.ayoob.com">http://www.ayoob.com</a> is considered &quot;Extreme&quot; (that's akin to obscene)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These can be verified by testing the URLs using the web-form at
<br>
<a href="http://www.securecomputing.com/cgi-bin/filter_whereV3.cgi">http://www.securecomputing.com/cgi-bin/filter_whereV3.cgi</a>
<br>
[It would be a good idea to do such a check before you send out this
<br>
message, because the blacklist may be changed after this is publicized]
