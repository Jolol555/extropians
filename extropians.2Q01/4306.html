<br>
|This 3-door Monty problem was a thread that lasted six weeks on
<br>
|the Usenet newsgroup: sci.math.num-analysis in the Summer of 1995.
<br>
|It is unusual to have a topic generate that  much  discussion..
<br>
|so be prepared!
<br>
|
<br>
|At that time, the participants had divided themselves into
<br>
|&quot;two-thirdsers,&quot; and &quot;one-halfers&quot; and had vigorous debates.
<br>
|
<br>
|I was so amused by the whole thing that I wrote an article about
<br>
|this long thread for an Internet newsletter that I was writing for
<br>
|at the time, and my spouse (now ex) wrote a simulation and put it on
<br>
|the Web to show that the result had to be 2/3. I don't think that
<br>
|simulation exists now, but it would be easy to write to prove
<br>
|for yourself.
<br>
<p>For the 3-door Monty problem, most humans intuitively compute 1/2.
<br>
Since the correct answer computes to 2/3, this problem's answer
<br>
goes against intuition (aka common sense).
<br>
<p>You do not need any simulation, as the following discussion shows:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A     B     C
<br>
+---+ +---+ +---+
<br>
|   | |   | |   | 
<br>
| 0 | | 0 | | 1 |
<br>
| 0 | | 1 | | 0 | 
<br>
| 1 | | 0 | | 0 | 
<br>
|   | |   | |   | 
<br>
+---+ +---+ +---+
<br>
<p>Assume you choose door A.
<br>
Then Mr.Gameshow opens a door from the set {B,C},
<br>
namely the one with a zero behind it:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A     B     C
<br>
+---+ +---+ +---+
<br>
|   | |   | |   | 
<br>
| 0 | | X | | 1 |	X = taken (equal to zero).
<br>
| 0 | | 1 | | X | 
<br>
| 1 | | 0 | | X |	(in last case, Mr.Gameshow could equally
<br>
|   | |   | |   |	 well choose 'B' as 'C'. 'C' taken here)
<br>
+---+ +---+ +---+
<br>
<p>Now compute the number of '1's behind A
<br>
to the number of '1's behind B and C.
<br>
<p>A contains 1/3 and B+C contain 2/3 (total = 3/3 = 1, naturally).
