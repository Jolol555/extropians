<em>&gt; Given my dislike of anything that smells like magic physics that

<em>&gt; we do not have known pre-existing examples of engineering of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type, I will suggest exploring that realm as a useful exercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until all the other possible approaches have been exhausted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [I will note that Anders usually confines himself to the known realm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well, but does from time to time stray into speculations in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas...  But I suppose this is to be expected from individuals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend their spare time developing role-playing games...]
</em><br>
<p>PROGRAMMABLE BLACK HOLE COMPUTERS.  One usually
<br>
thinks of a black hole as an omnivorous object swallowing energy
<br>
and spitting some of it back in the form of Hawking evaporation
<br>
radiation, consisting of particles created in pairs out of the vacuum
<br>
near the edge of the black hole.  In principle, a tiny black hole can
<br>
be formed in a way that encodes instructions for performing
<br>
calculations.  Correspondingly, the answers could be read out from
<br>
the escaping Hawking radiation.  Why use a black hole at all?
<br>
Because of the presumed  tremendous density of information and
<br>
potential processing speed implicit in the extreme black hole
<br>
environment.  Seth Lloyd of MIT has previously addressed himself
<br>
to calculating the conceivable limits on the computing power of
<br>
such a black hole computer (Nature, 31 August 2000) and arrives
<br>
at a maximum processing speed of about 10^51 operations/sec for
<br>
a 1-kg black hole.  Now Jack Ng of the University of North
<br>
Carolina <a href="mailto:yjng@physics.unc.edu?Subject=Re:%20Small%20Talk:%20How%20small%20can%20you%20get?&In-Reply-To=&lt;323901c0bad4$dcdd5620$915d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">yjng@physics.unc.edu</a>, 919-962-7208) extends this study
<br>
by asking whether the very foaminess of spacetime, thought to
<br>
arise at the level of 10^-35 m, provides an alternative way to limit
<br>
theoretical computation.  Ng not only finds that it does but that the
<br>
foaminess of spacetime leads to an uncertainty in timekeeping (the
<br>
more accurate the clock, the shorter its
<br>
lifetime) which in turn leads to a bound on information processing
<br>
(speed and memory simultaneously) analogous to the Heisenberg
<br>
bound on simultaneous measurement of momentum and position.
<br>
These limits are so generous that they normally pose little problem
<br>
for ordinary physical measurements, but in the case of black hole
<br>
computer the limits would apply immediately.  Ng adds, apropos
<br>
of detecting gravity waves with LIGO and other interferometric
<br>
devices, that in addition to accounting for various forms of noise,
<br>
such as seismic disturbances or thermal noise in the detectors, the
<br>
faint gurgle of spacetime foam will eventually have to be  included
<br>
as an additional and unavoidable source of noise in the
<br>
measurement of very short displacements (the movement of
<br>
mirrors owing to the flexings of spacetime brought about by
<br>
passing gravity waves).    If Ng is right, the noise sensitivity
<br>
achievable by the prospective advanced phase of LIGO will only
<br>
need a further hundredfold enhancement in order to detect the
<br>
quantum foam, which is to say the very fabric of spacetime.   Thus
<br>
the Planck scale, so far only a hypothetical extreme regime, might
<br>
eventually become a realm that can be approached and measured.

<br>
Most of us are familiar with the SI units kilo (k), milli (m), micro (æ) etc.
<br>
But some of the prefixes for smaller quantities are unfamiliar. As analytical
<br>
techniques have become more sensitive so we can measure less and less in more
<br>
and more. The latest prefixes to be assigned are zepto (z) for 10-21 and yocto
<br>
(y) for 10-24. &quot;Professor Dovichi, a leader in ultra microanalytical
<br>
techniques, jokingly suggested that these units have been named in honour of
<br>
the lesser-known Marx brothers. Indeed, the baptismal habits of the
<br>
International Committee of Weights and Measures are mysterious, as the
<br>
bastardized Scandinavian femto- (f) and attom- (a) had already proved. Joke
<br>
aside, the need to for having units as small as 10-21 and 10-24 is a serious
<br>
and dramatic development. After all, a yoctomole is less than a single
<br>
molecule. It makes sense only as a probability in a quantum mechanical
<br>
context.&quot;
