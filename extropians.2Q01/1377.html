<p><em>&gt;&gt; to start: we may not be agreeing about what a zombie is. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Here is Dennett's definition, p. 72-73 of Consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Explained: &quot;According to common agreement among philosophers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a zombie is or would be a human being who exhibits perfectly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; natural, alert, loquascious, vivacious behavior but is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fact not conscious at all, but rather some sort of automaton.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Zombie would seem to indicate that the purpose of such programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to  convince a &quot;self-aware&quot; observer, that the zombies are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fact, self-aware individuals... When a Zombie became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-aware (conscious) Professor Moriarity, he ceased being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a zombie and became an individual personality, a mind. 
</em><br>
<p>Here is what is happening:  The Holodeck, like any good SI, mocks
<br>
up a portrayal of Professor Moriarty for the benefit of the
<br>
actual sapients watching.  At this point, by definition, Moriarty
<br>
has no consciousness or or feelings.  You could, for example,
<br>
attempt to do anything whatsoever to the Professor without
<br>
even coming close to harming anyone.  Now, yes, the SI is
<br>
conscious, probably very much more so than we are, and not
<br>
only has our feelings, but emotions of a nature that entirely
<br>
surpass ours.  But the key point is that the SI is no more truly
<br>
involved... than you are when you scratch your dog's ears while
<br>
talking on the phone!
<br>
<p>But then comes the transformation that you describe: the SI
<br>
spawns the Professor Moriarty process, and now there is a
<br>
separate, human-level sentience, with separate consciousness,
<br>
feelings, etc.  As to whether the actual Moriarty consciousness
<br>
(if we feel justified in talking about such a thing), or the
<br>
actual Moriarty feelings (ditto) existed isomorphically in
<br>
the complex SI is a question too deep to pursue in this email.
<br>
(I believe the answer is, for all practical purposes, &quot;no&quot;.)
<br>
<p>But why dignify that earlier mere portrayal with the term
<br>
&quot;zombie&quot;, which HAS ALWAYS MEANT an independent creature
<br>
(not a puppet) whose behavior is identical but who lacks
<br>
consciousness (which is impossible or nonsensical)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not that many philosophers watched the Trek episodes, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that one fellow from Australia, several years back, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus talk chiefly amongst themselves. Few actual philosophers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the large view of a Max More. Hence, most of us happily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn to scientists, for inspiration and each other.
</em><br>
<p>You are quite correct, although if you think it's bad now, you
<br>
should have been around in the sixties.  It seemed as though
<br>
not one single philosopher anywhere on the planet was up to
<br>
speed with even the most elementary implications of scientific
<br>
materialism (excepting the great Australian philosopher
<br>
J. J. C. Smart).  (Why have Australian philosophers, e.g. D.M.
<br>
Armstrong too, always been in the lead???)
<br>
<p>But today it is different.  Dennett, Churchland, Pinker, Humphrey,
<br>
Kauffman, Blackmore, Dawkins, and many others---they are our true
<br>
&quot;natural philosophers&quot; today.  I realize that few of them are
<br>
credentialed university philosophers---that's why there is much
<br>
truth in what you say.
<br>
<p>But even they probably have not watched Star Trek.  Yet they
<br>
do know their science, and most can think quite clearly
<br>
without being blindly dogmatic.  So it behooves us to not
<br>
be blindly prejudiced against the &quot;philosphers&quot; among them.
<br>
<p>Yet, it's true, to paraphrase a maxim from an earlier era,
<br>
&quot;philosophy is too important to be left to the philosophers&quot;.
