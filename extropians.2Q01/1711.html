<em>&gt; This is what's striking about the lookup table scenario. It
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent.  It acts completely indistinguishably from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real human being, but we cannot, I claim, believe that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feels anything or is even as conscious as an insect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason is: take any five minute sequence of your best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moments with this &quot;Eugene Leitl&quot;: while all the laughing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rollicking corresponds to non-trivial data analyses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and information flow in your head, it's almost a random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence of lookups in &quot;his&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Not random, surely.  For one thing, the index into the lookup table, if
<br>
expressed as a binary address, presumably carries as much information
<br>
as is in your own brain.  And each successive change of that index is
<br>
a transformation every bit as causal and dependent upon experience as
<br>
the changes in your own brain from one moment to the next.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, to reinterate, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence would be no different if it were activated in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly random order, or just layed out in a linear order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere without being fetched at all.
</em><br>
<p>The sequence of what, of states?  You are saying that after Eugene has
<br>
had an experience, you could write down the series of states, and then
<br>
play them back in a simple way?  Which of course you could do with your
<br>
own brain as well, right?  You could write down the sequence of your
<br>
own neural brain states and then &quot;play them back&quot;.
<br>
<p>The question is, are such playbacks conscious.  Your initial experience
<br>
was conscious; Eugene's experience was at least conscious when you created
<br>
the lookup table, and possibly when you jumped around in it again later.
<br>
Now you are playing back some of that experience.
<br>
<p>What does it mean to ask if a playback is conscious?  IMO it is a less
<br>
meaningful question than even the hard question of what it means to
<br>
be conscious at all.  Consider the question of whether an oyster, say,
<br>
is conscious.  We wonder whether it is &quot;like something&quot; to be an oyster.
<br>
While it is not at all clear how to learn the answer to this question,
<br>
philosophically we have a sense of what the question means.  We poke
<br>
the oyster, and we wonder if there is an entity which felt itself being
<br>
poked in somewhat the same way that we feel sensations.
<br>
<p>But for a playback, the question is harder.  Suppose we play back an
<br>
experience of drinking orange juice.  We know that there is or was a
<br>
conscious entity which had that experience.  What we want to know is,
<br>
when we replay it, does it have that experience again.  We want to know
<br>
whether it is having the experience right here/now during the playback.
<br>
We know the experience itself exists or existed, but we want to localize
<br>
it in space and time.  We want to know whether it exists in that region
<br>
of spacetime where we are doing the replay, in addition to its existence
<br>
in the region of the first run-through.
<br>
<p>I know little about what consciousness is, and as part of that uncertainty
<br>
I have severe doubts about how well it can be localized.  Consciousness
<br>
may not be something which has a location in space and time.  After all,
<br>
consciousness is completely intangible; it has no mass, it has none of the
<br>
normal properties of matter or energy, so there is no particular reason
<br>
to expect it to share with them the property of locality.  Therefore it
<br>
may not be meaningful to ask whether a replay is again conscious, in
<br>
addition to the consciousness which it had the first time through.
<br>
<p>In that case, when we lay out a series of pre-recorded mind states, or
<br>
create a machine which goes through them by rote, it is not meaningful
<br>
to ask whether this produces consciousness.  We are doing a replay of
<br>
an existing consciousness; there is no question but that the original
<br>
consciousness has existed, because it made an impact on the world that
<br>
could not have happened in any other way.  But to ask whether the replay
<br>
or the recording of the states is conscious requires making much stronger
<br>
assumptions about the nature of consciousness.  I don't think we are in
<br>
a position to make those assumptions.
