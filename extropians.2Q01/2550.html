I got the flu and and could not have food in my stomach or gastrointestinal
<br>
system for the day a couple weeks ago.  The reason I say that is because it is
<br>
one of the few times in the past ten years that I have been ill besides from
<br>
drinking large quantities of alcohol.  So, it went away and I felt better the
<br>
next day.
<br>
<p>So, I weigh the same as I did before that, having the flu, which is more now
<br>
than then.  It was a serious illness, I was vomiting every fifteen minutes for
<br>
hours, which when before it started felt quite irregular, thus that I noticed
<br>
it.  So, I spent more than six hours moving to and from the bathroom, I was
<br>
lucid for having several fevers.  The next day, I still could not eat very much
<br>
at all.  My mother brought me some soup.  The day after that, I ate regular
<br>
food.  I almost feel better for having had it, but would not redo it.
<br>
<p>Having a healthy immune system is a good thing, as well as is having good
<br>
health.  I learned new things about vomiting.

<p>About the reserves, it is true and false.  Think about this, body reserves form
<br>
fat are left over as a defense from back in the days when food might be
<br>
unavailable.  Also, there are large people and then there are people who are not
<br>
as mobile because of higher concentrations of body fat, but some people that are
<br>
large actually have larger muscles, so there are fat people and fat people.
<br>
<p>My metabolism, for example, is fast to the point that there is more body fat for
<br>
being relatively sedentary and eating fatty foods than before.  When I say
<br>
relatively sedentary that means sitting at a computer for hundreds and hundreds
<br>
of hours mixed with sleep and walking around.
<br>
<p>Is there a particular reason that Spike's physical characteristic is of note
<br>
herein or is this moreso recognition of Spike for something?  I will reread what
<br>
is there.

<em>&gt; &gt; Ja, its scary.  My BMI has always been in the

<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, they told me that 10 years ago, but

<p>I do not think I exercise that much.  I think Spike has said things about
<br>
motorcycling.  I think action sports are interesting, like driving sports.
<br>
<p>What is CR?
<br>
<p>There are all kinds of drugs.  Basically, drugs are chemicals.  Alcohol, for
<br>
example, drinking alcohol, is a simple and unsurprisely effective drug.
