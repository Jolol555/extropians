<p>----------
<br>
<p>Computers – the link between soap bubbles and satellites
<br>
<p>A computer model originally applied to understanding the
<br>
formation of soap bubbles has been used to gauge how much fuel
<br>
is left to manoeuvre communications satellites - a development
<br>
potentially worth millions of dollars for the companies that
<br>
operate the satellites.
<br>
<p>As a bonus, the technique, developed by engineers at Purdue
<br>
University in Indiana USA, uses temperature data that is already
<br>
collected routinely, so it does not requires any additional
<br>
hardware and can be applied to existing spacecraft. Satellites
<br>
are maintained in geostationary orbit about 22,500 miles above
<br>
Earth by firing small rocket thrusters, and they have to be
<br>
replaced before they run out of fuel and lose position. In
<br>
addition, enough fuel must remain to get the old satellite out
<br>
of orbit to make room for its replacement.
<br>
<p>Since a single satellite may earn annual revenues in the
<br>
billions of dollars, companies have an interest in avoiding its
<br>
premature retirement.
<br>
<p>More accurate fuel-gauging methods are needed so that companies
<br>
can better determine when to replace a satellite. For satellites
<br>
that send signals to pagers or residential TV dishes, just one
<br>
pound of hydrazine rocket fuel translates into about $2.5
<br>
million in revenue so the hydrazine is worth more than its
<br>
weight in gold.
<br>
<p>Precisely measuring the amount of propellant in a satellite's
<br>
fuel tank is not so easy. Steven Collicott, an associate
<br>
professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue and one of
<br>
the authors of the new system, pointed out that 'it's not like a
<br>
car's fuel tank, which has a little float that floats on top of
<br>
the gasoline and moves a lever. Floats don't work in space
<br>
because everything is floating.'
<br>
<p>Conventional methods involve estimating fuel consumption from
<br>
the number and duration of all rocket firings since launch.
<br>
However, the Purdue engineers used a model created in the early
<br>
1990s by Kenneth Brakke, a mathematics professor at Susquehanna
<br>
University, initially to describe the mathematics behind such
<br>
phenomena as the formation of soap bubbles.
<br>
<p>Collicott's application of the model uses routine temperature
<br>
data from the satellite to monitor how much fuel is left in the
<br>
tank. Heaters are needed to keep the fuel from freezing, and
<br>
those areas of the tank that contain fuel take longer to heat,
<br>
while portions of the tank that are empty heat up faster. The
<br>
more fuel that is present, the longer it takes to heat.
<br>
<p>The model uses the temperature information to provide a
<br>
detailed, three-dimensional understanding of where fuel is
<br>
located inside the tank. That information can, in turn, be used
<br>
to calculate how much fuel remains in the tank. The technique
<br>
may be improved in the future, as researchers gain a better
<br>
understanding of how fluids behave in weightlessness.
