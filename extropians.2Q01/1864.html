<p><em>&gt; Here is a puzzle that I formulated on this subject that's fun. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A great mathematician is at a party, and two students come 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up to him. One says, &quot;I have found a proof that Goldbach's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conjecture is unprovable!&quot;. The mathematician snorts, &quot;Go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away, you crackpot&quot;. Then the other student says, &quot;I have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found a proof that whether or not there exist infinitely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many prime pairs is unprovable!&quot;, and the mathematician's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eyes light up and he says &quot;Oh, really!? Please tell me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more!&quot;.  Why was the mathematician eager to hear out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second student, but not the first?
</em><br>
<p>I'll give what I think is the answer, but then I'll give a counter-
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p>Goldbach's Conjecture is that every even number is the sum of two primes.
<br>
If it is false, there must be an even number which is not the sum of
<br>
two primes.  If such a number exists, then by showing it we could show
<br>
that GC is false and GC would not be unprovable (that is, it would be
<br>
provably false).  For GC to be unprovable, therefore, would mean that
<br>
no such number exists.  But this is simply the statement of GC itself,
<br>
so to show it to be unprovable (undecidable) is to show it to be true.
<br>
Hence you can't show GC to be unprovable.
<br>
<p>Now here's my counter-argument.  When we speak of provability, it is
<br>
in the context of a certain set of axioms.  Mathematicians have agreed
<br>
upon a set of axioms which characterizes the behavior of the integers.
<br>
The question of GC provability is then in the context of this set of
<br>
axioms.
<br>
<p>However we can imagine a weaker set of axioms, one which does not allow
<br>
us to make all the proofs we have now.  I don't know enough mathematics
<br>
to give a specific example, but by analogy think of Euclidean geometry
<br>
without the parallel postulate.  You can still make a lot of proofs,
<br>
just not all of them.
<br>
<p>It's conceivable that in this weaker axiom system, we could show that
<br>
GC is unprovable.  In fact we might be able to show that a number of
<br>
well-established theorems are unprovable.  I know this is possible in
<br>
geometry; for one thing, you can show that the parallel postulate itself
<br>
is unprovable (and hence independent) from the other axioms.
<br>
<p>Since we can conceive of this, it's also possible to imagine that
<br>
GC can be shown to be unprovable even in the full axiom system.
<br>
It's possible that an even stronger axiom system would be needed to
<br>
prove the GC.
<br>
<p>Now, how does this fit with the original argument above, which seemed
<br>
sound?  Again, think of the analogy to Euclidean geometry minus the
<br>
parallel postulate.  For a long time it was thought that this set of
<br>
axioms might fully characterize the plane, and people spent years trying
<br>
to derive the parallel postulate from the others.  However it turned out
<br>
that this was wrong; this truncated geometry does not fully characterize
<br>
the plane.  There are non-planar systems which satisfy the remaining
<br>
axioms but which behave differently with respect to parallel lines.
<br>
The truncated axiom system leaves a certain ambiguity with respect to
<br>
certain kinds of questions.
<br>
<p>Applying this analogy to the integers, for GC to be proven undecideable we
<br>
would have to find that there was some class of numbers which satisfies
<br>
the postulates of arithmetic, but for which GC was indeterminate.
<br>
For example, perhaps we could extend the integers with a new class of
<br>
numbers that was intermediate between the countables and the infinites.
<br>
These numbers could perhaps be able to satisfy the axioms of arithmetic,
<br>
but to leave some ambiguity about whether they could be said to be the
<br>
sum of two primes.  Depending on how we interpreted the applicability
<br>
of the axioms to these new numbers, we might get different results with
<br>
regard to the truth of GC.  Then we could say that we had shown that GC
<br>
is unprovable.
<br>
<p>Admittedly, it seems unlikely that such an ambiguity could exist in
<br>
such an old and well studied a field as arithmetic.  However our minds
<br>
are only of finite power and it's possible that there are subtle ways
<br>
in which the integers could be extended and still satisfy the axioms.
<br>
After all, intelligent men for centuries still thought that the parallel
<br>
postulate might follow from the others.  We could be making a similar
<br>
mistake about the completeness of our arithemetical axiom systems.
