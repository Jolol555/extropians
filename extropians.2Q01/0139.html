<p>In Europe, the Ordinary Takes a Frightening Turn 
<br>
<p>By T.R. Reid

<br>
<p><p>LONDON -- A bowl of cornflakes can kill you -- not to mention a ham sandwich 
<br>
or a T-bone steak. Getting vaccinated can kill you. Flying economy class can 
<br>
kill you, and business class isn't much better. The rubber duckie in your 
<br>
bathtub can kill you (and your children). And put down that cell phone, 
<br>
before it kills you!
<br>
<p>Such is the woeful catalogue of warnings that confront Europeans these days 
<br>
as the continent veers almost weekly from one health panic to the next. From 
<br>
Belfast to Belgrade, wealthy, well-educated Europe is regularly swept by 
<br>
frightening reports of new dangers said to be inherent to contemporary life. 
<br>
The lack of scientific basis for many of the worries doesn't stanch the flood.
<br>
<p>Americans have health concerns, too, but not on this scale. The year 2001 is 
<br>
barely eight weeks old and already public opinion and public officials here 
<br>
have been rattled by alarms over risks -- proven and not -- from genetically 
<br>
modified corn, hormone-fed beef and pork, &quot;mad cow&quot; disease, a widely used 
<br>
measles vaccine, narrow airline seats said to cause blood clots and cellular 
<br>
phones said to cause brain damage.
<br>
<p>&quot;If these stories were true, we should all be dead by now,&quot; quipped Mart 
<br>
Saarma, a biologist at the Helsinki Institute of Biotechnology.
<br>
<p>Saarma attributes the &quot;culture of fear&quot; to carry-over from genuine health 
<br>
problems, trends in environmentalism, anti-Americanism and a pessimistic 
<br>
strain in the European psyche. &quot;It is a matter of emotion here,&quot; he said. 
<br>
&quot;Americans seem to be pragmatic about new ideas and inventions. Europeans 
<br>
tend to worry. That leads to this concept of being always on the safe side -- 
<br>
being against anything new until it is absolutely proven.&quot;
<br>
<p>It seems strange that this aversion to the new should break out in Europe, 
<br>
which gave the world the industrial revolution, quantum physics and modern 
<br>
genetics. Europe is the home of the Nobel Prize, the million-dollar award 
<br>
that celebrates scientific advances. Europeans cloned Dolly the sheep. They 
<br>
invented Viagra.
<br>
<p>The continent remains a formidable force in global technology. The world's 
<br>
fastest (the Concorde) and biggest (the forthcoming 550-seat Airbus A380) 
<br>
commercial jetliners are European products. Finland's Nokia and Sweden's 
<br>
Ericsson dominate global cellular phone markets, having passed the U.S. 
<br>
leader, Motorola, two years ago.
<br>
<p>And yet a pervasive technophobia throbs like background music beneath the 
<br>
rhythms of everyday life here, fueled by skeptical media, the political 
<br>
success of environmentally minded Green parties and a growing regulatory 
<br>
apparatus at European Union headquarters in Brussels.
<br>
<p>The fear stems in large part from Europe's experience with a genuine health 
<br>
risk, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as &quot;mad cow&quot; 
<br>
disease. The epidemic began in Britain in the 1980s and has recently been 
<br>
detected among beef cattle in France, Germany and Italy. A variant of the 
<br>
disease is believed to have killed about 84 people over the past decade and 
<br>
has forced the slaughter of millions of head of cattle. 
<br>
<p>In the case of mad cow, Europe's staple entree is being potentially 
<br>
contaminated by a poorly understood disease. Even worse, governments hit by 
<br>
the crisis tended to insist at first that everything was fine -- and then 
<br>
backtracked. Eventually, Europeans decided that official assurances were 
<br>
close to worthless.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is no question that BSE influenced people's trust in the whole public 
<br>
safety regime,&quot; said Michael Meacher, Britain's environment minister. &quot;We 
<br>
live with this now when other perceived risks come along. People are less 
<br>
willing to listen to experts who say, 'There's nothing to worry about.' &quot;
<br>
<p>In recent weeks, Britain has embarked on a campaign against another animal 
<br>
ailment, foot-and-mouth disease, after it appeared among a dozen pigs last 
<br>
week. Although humans seldom contract the disease, 15,000 animals have been 
<br>
killed or will be killed to prevent its spread, British authorities said.
<br>
<p>Fear has spread to other foods and products, especially those that result 
<br>
from new technologies. Most intense has been the reaction against genetically 
<br>
modified crops, known here by the shorthand term GMO, for genetically 
<br>
modified organism. Americans and Canadians consume genetic hybrids of corn, 
<br>
soybeans and other foods every day. A National Academy of Sciences study 
<br>
concluded that new varieties are no different from traditional hybrids.
<br>
<p>But GMOs are restricted across Europe; the media treat the crops as if they 
<br>
were lethal. Last spring, when it was reported that minute quantities -- well 
<br>
below 1 percent -- of GMO seeds had inadvertently been mixed into bags of 
<br>
Canadian seed sold to European farmers in 1998 and 1999, newspapers warned of 
<br>
&quot;contamination&quot; and &quot;poisoning.&quot; Frightened consumers returned boxes of 
<br>
cornflakes to grocery stores demanding refunds.
<br>
<p>This month the European Parliament mandated a rigorous approval process 
<br>
before any new genetic hybrid could be planted in European soil. The sponsor 
<br>
of the plan proudly labeled it &quot;the toughest in the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>Similar scares surround pork and beef raised with growth hormones; rubber 
<br>
duckies and other plastic toys made with softeners called phthalates; and the 
<br>
MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.
<br>
<p>Cellular phones are much more widely used in Europe than in the United 
<br>
States, but they, too, often evoke a confused state of dread. A British 
<br>
consumer group last year suggested that cell phone owners use earphones to 
<br>
reduce the risk of brain damage from transmission signals. Just as consumers 
<br>
were digesting that idea, another report concluded that earphones might 
<br>
actually increase the risk. A British government study last year found no 
<br>
link between cell phones and brain damage.
<br>
<p>The European media have been full of reports this year on the alleged dangers 
<br>
of depleted uranium, a metal used in munitions during the Persian Gulf War 
<br>
and in Kosovo. Several European governments have launched high-profile 
<br>
emergency tests of the material. Many studies in the United States have found 
<br>
it safe.
<br>
<p>This winter's major health scare in Britain has been &quot;economy-class syndrome&quot; 
<br>
-- the fear that long hours spent in a cramped airplane seat will lead to 
<br>
&quot;deep vein thrombosis,&quot; causing blood clots to travel to the lungs. There has 
<br>
been one confirmed death this year -- a young woman flying from Sydney to 
<br>
London -- but newspapers have suggested that the toll may reach 2,000 
<br>
annually.
<br>
<p>Why is Europe so hung up on health problems? One theory ties the phenomenon 
<br>
to the decline of religious faith. &quot;Churchgoers now amount to less than 15 
<br>
percent of the population,&quot; said Philip Lader, the U.S. ambassador to 
<br>
Britain, and this might prompt &quot;a human need for some other larger-than-life 
<br>
issues. Perhaps that has something to do with the religious-like fervor of 
<br>
the opposition to [genetically modified] foods.&quot;
<br>
<p>Since many of the technological breakthroughs that lead to phobias are 
<br>
identified with big American or multinational companies, the negative 
<br>
response may tie in with the aversion to globalization among the working 
<br>
class and the anti-Americanism that is never far from the surface among 
<br>
Europe's intelligentsia.
<br>
<p>&quot;One of our big problems with GMO crops,&quot; said Des D'Souza of the European 
<br>
seed company AgrEvo, &quot;is that people think they all come from the U.S., and 
<br>
right there you start to generate resentment.&quot;
<br>
<p>Europe's wariness of the new also reflects the feeling of anomie, of systemic 
<br>
breakdown, that is central to much of modern European philosophy. The German 
<br>
novelist Gunter Grass has written that the proper European response to the 
<br>
&quot;lusty appeals of progress&quot; is melancholy. In contrast to the &quot;American 
<br>
conception of happiness embodied in the say-cheese smile,&quot; Grass argues, the 
<br>
European is more comfortable with &quot;knowledge that engenders disgust.&quot;
<br>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair has cautioned Britons about a &quot;loss of faith in 
<br>
science,&quot; which he says is particularly problematic now because Europe 
<br>
depends on technology to maintain its place in global markets. Some health 
<br>
concerns may be &quot;reasonable,&quot; Blair said last month, &quot;but it is possible to 
<br>
overdo that very greatly.&quot;
<br>
<p>Finally, there is a sense in Europe that genetic manipulation, wireless 
<br>
communication, global transportation and other wonders of modernity hinder 
<br>
the appreciation of more traditional aspects of human life. That view is 
<br>
often set forth by one of the continent's most admired thinkers, Pope John 
<br>
Paul II.
<br>
<p>In a recent sermon, the pope recalled the biblical admonition to &quot;consider 
<br>
the lilies of the field . . . they toil not, neither do they spin.&quot; The 
<br>
contemporary lesson to draw from the lilies, he said, is, &quot;In the era of 
<br>
technology, our life risks becoming always more anonymous and . . . man 
<br>
becomes incapable of enjoying the beauties of the creator.&quot;
