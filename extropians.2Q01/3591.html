<p>Oracle's Ellison seeking Fountain of Youth
<br>
He spends millions on anti-aging quest
<br>
BY MATT MARSHALL
<br>
Mercury News
<br>
<p>Centuries after America's early explorers searched in vain for the
<br>
fabled waters of the Fountain of Youth, the second-richest man in
<br>
the world has joined the hunt.
<br>
<p>In hopes of stopping the process of aging, Larry Ellison, the
<br>
brassy 55-year-old chief executive of Oracle, is quietly pumping
<br>
millions of dollars into research and other investments. He's now
<br>
the single largest private supporter of research in aging, and he's
<br>
opening the spigot further.
<br>
<p>Ellison's efforts come at a time when interest in age-related
<br>
research is booming, spurred by breakthroughs in science that could
<br>
soon promise billions and perhaps trillions of dollars in profits.
<br>
Behind that interest are the aging baby boomers, the large number
<br>
of people born in the prosperity that came after World War II, who
<br>
have hit or are nearing their golden years. Few embody the
<br>
preoccupation with age more than Ellison.
<br>
<p>``Most people accept early on that they will die,'' said Ellison
<br>
biographer Mark Wilson. ``But part of Larry Ellison is saying if
<br>
he's smart enough, he should be able to beat it. . . . Death is
<br>
just another kind of corporate opponent that he can outfox.''
<br>
<p>Ellison and Oracle declined to comment last week. But in a previous
<br>
speech, Ellison said the cost of health care for an aging
<br>
population ``will literally bankrupt the nation,'' and that the
<br>
boomers, including himself, are a ``demographic sword of Damocles''
<br>
hanging over the necks of younger generations.
<br>
<p>Scientists generally agree that human life can be extended, but are
<br>
divided about how much. Optimists hope a breakthrough in the next
<br>
30 years will extend human life to 150 years or more, but
<br>
conservatives believe life will be extended slowly, as a side
<br>
effect of regenerative drugs.
<br>
<p>The investment community is taking note.
<br>
<p>Steve Jurvetson, a partner at the venture-capital firm Draper
<br>
Fisher  Jurvetson, is scouting out ways to get into the field. He
<br>
believes that within 30 years, people will live 120 to 140 years.
<br>
<p>His partner, Tim Draper, has invested privately in a Sunnyvale
<br>
firm, Layton Bioscience, which is refining a process of cell
<br>
regeneration to cure brain damage after a stroke. Layton CEO Gary
<br>
Snable said the work is directly applicable to extending age. This
<br>
week, Layton is expected to close a $30 million round of funding.
<br>
<p><p>Generating big money
<br>
<p>Big-name venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers has invested
<br>
in  publicly traded Geron. And Peter Friedli has invested in Osiris
<br>
Therapeutics, which works with adult stem cells.
<br>
<p>This month, Friedli joined Oracle to invest in Myriad Genetics,
<br>
which researches the human proteome. It is Oracle's first foray
<br>
into biotech.
<br>
<p>However, researchers say Ellison's money is the most crucial
<br>
because itseeds research at the earliest stages.
<br>
<p>``Ellison's money has been extremely important,'' said Thomas
<br>
Johnson, a University of Colorado geneticist who is trying to
<br>
extend the lifespan of mice.
<br>
<p>Ellison has shown a lifelong fascination with science and age.
<br>
<p>Born to an unwed mother in 1944, Ellison was adopted by relatives
<br>
and raised in a middle-class Jewish home in Chicago. A friend's
<br>
father, a chemical researcher, became a role model. Ellison applied
<br>
for medical school but never went.
<br>
<p>Ellison later met Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg. They schmoozed
<br>
most of the night at Ellison's villa in Atherton, talking mostly
<br>
about biotech, Lederberg said. Lederberg then invited Ellison to
<br>
his lab for a two-week ``vacation'' handling DNA in strains of
<br>
bacteria -- ``so he could get his hands dirty,'' Lederberg said.
<br>
<p>Ellison's adoptive mother died of cancer when he was in college. He
<br>
said later that he didn't tell anyone about it for years.
<br>
<p>Later, Robert Miner, co-founder of Oracle, also died of cancer at
<br>
52. Ellison pretended Miner didn't have cancer or wouldn't have it
<br>
for long, according to those close to him.
<br>
<p>``He was getting to an age when he was feeling vulnerable,'' said
<br>
Lederberg. Ellison insisted on keeping Miner on the payroll,
<br>
according to Wilson's 1997 biography, ``The Difference Between God
<br>
and Larry Ellison.''
<br>
<p>``Dad and Larry were both into living forever, the Fountain of
<br>
Youth kind of stuff,'' said Nicola Miner, his daughter, in the
<br>
Wilson biography. ``I think that my dad's illness really freaked
<br>
him out. My dad always said that Larry had a hard time facing his
<br>
own mortality.''
<br>
<p>When Ellison was told of Miner's death, he reportedly demanded
<br>
proof.``It doesn't make any sense to me,'' Ellison later told
<br>
Wilson. ``Death has never made any sense to me. How can a person be
<br>
there and then just vanish, just not be there? Clearly the reason
<br>
they're not there is they're off doing something else. Like Bob
<br>
was. . . . Death makes me very angry. Premature death makes me
<br>
angrier still.''
<br>
<p><p>Obsession with youth
<br>
<p>Every aspect of Ellison's life is youth-oriented, Wilson said, from
<br>
physical fitness and a penchant for carrot juice to a love of cars
<br>
and women and a nose job at an early age.
<br>
<p>Some say his obsession with youth has spilled into the workplace.
<br>
Ellison is being sued for age discrimination by Randy Baker, a
<br>
former Oracle executive. Baker, who is 55 -- the same age as
<br>
Ellison -- contends Ellison made several derogatory comments about
<br>
age and older workers.
<br>
<p>Baker was demoted, replaced by a manager who is about 40, and then
<br>
fired. Ellison's attorneys would not comment on the pending case.
<br>
<p>Ellison's investments into age research have slowly grown. He
<br>
funded research at the University of California on DHEA, a hormone
<br>
some believe could retard aging. Through his private venture fund,
<br>
Tako Ventures, he has made investments in several other biotech
<br>
companies.
<br>
<p><p>Centenarians studied
<br>
<p>One was Aeiveos -- named after Greek words for ``forever'' and
<br>
``young'' -- founded by Robert Bradbury, an early employee at
<br>
Oracle. Aeiveos studied the genetic codes of centenarians, those
<br>
who live to the ripe old age of 100 and more.
<br>
<p>But soon it became clear that without a basic scientific
<br>
breakthrough, profits were elusive, observers said. Ellison
<br>
installed his former employee to run the company despite little
<br>
knowledge of the field, some said. Bradbury, a Harvard dropout, is
<br>
an Extropian, a group of believers in the idea that genetic
<br>
engineering will prolong life.
<br>
<p>``I find it intriguing,'' said Johnson, the scientist, ``that Larry
<br>
Ellison  was bankrolling them, but unlike his astuteness in running
<br>
computer engineering, he ignored people who knew what was going on
<br>
in the field he was funding.''
<br>
<p>Ellison has committed $20 million a year to aging research through
<br>
a newly created Ellison Medical Foundation. As of January, the
<br>
foundation is investing $45 million a year, $25 million of which is
<br>
to fight global infectious disease.
<br>
<p>Ellison put Lederberg on the board, and recruited another big
<br>
player: Richard Sprott, former director of the Biology of Aging
<br>
program at the National Institute of Aging.
<br>
<p>Sprott said Ellison is ``hands-on'' in funding decisions. But some
<br>
say Lederberg and Sprott have reined him in.
<br>
<p>`I think Ellison is more interested in the radical stuff,'' says
<br>
Max More, president of the Extropy Institute, who has kept close
<br>
tabs on funding in the field.
<br>
<p>The foundation funds scores of academics studying aging, to get
<br>
them to the stage where government or venture-capital funding can
<br>
take over.
<br>
<p>Several of the researchers Ellison has funded are now seeking to
<br>
turn profits. One is Cynthia Kenyon, who extended the lifespan of
<br>
worms 300 percent. She has teamed up with an associate of Arch
<br>
Venture Capital, Cindy Bayley, to form a company called Elixir.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, profits or no profits, the world -- and Ellison -- will
<br>
have to be patient.
<br>
<p>``Even if the Fountain of Youth is discovered,'' Lederberg said,
<br>
``it will be 10 years before anyone got any benefit.''
