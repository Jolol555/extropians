<p>I'm no physicist (I'm a paid professional actor :-&gt;),
<br>
but my understanding is that string theory **is**
<br>
quantum mechanics, or rather, an attempt to construct
<br>
a mathematically consistent blend of quantum theory
<br>
and general relativity (i.e., quantum gravity).  The
<br>
&quot;strings&quot;, AFAIK, are substitutions of entities which
<br>
are extended, geometrically, for the points used
<br>
to formulate traditional quantum theory, in order to avoid
<br>
mathematical, uh, singularities [blush] that would
<br>
otherwise result.  Strings have been more recently
<br>
generalized into &quot;branes&quot; (M-branes, not to be confused
<br>
with M-brains [;-&gt;]).
<br>
<p>My friend Joe Fineman, who does have graduate training
<br>
in physics, has remarked that the fatal flaw in all
<br>
physics books written for a popular audience is that,
<br>
not being able to take advantage of the math that is
<br>
the heart and soul of the subject, they all degenerate
<br>
into hand-waving.  However, one book which I read fairly
<br>
recently (a couple of years ago -- I **do** wish I had permanent
<br>
recall of such things, as is dreamed about here :-&lt; ) and
<br>
enjoyed very much indeed (and which I thought was extremely lucid
<br>
and well-written) is Brian Greene's _The Elegant
<br>
Universe_ ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375708111">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375708111</a> ).
<br>
<p>I fished up some correspondence (with my friend Joe Fineman,
<br>
who from now on I'm simply going to refer to as &quot;F&quot;, which is
<br>
what I call him, anyway) from two years ago about the book:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I tell you I'm reading a physics book I picked up a couple
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of weeks ago -- _The Elegant Universe_ by one Brian Greene,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who is a professor of mathematics and physics at Columbia?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a layman's book (of course), but it seems quite serious
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to me (less flaky than the Deutsch book I bought when I visited
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, but never finished) -- it's an up-to-the-minute account of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the state of superstring theory, which seems to be quite 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respectable these days.  I'll send it along to you when I'm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done with it, if you like.
<br>
<p>----------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has anybody managed to _calculate_ anything with it?
</em><br>
<p>I gather it's still extremely hard to calculate physical quantities
<br>
(like particle masses, etc.) with enough precision to permit direct
<br>
experimental confirmation.
<br>
<p>However, there are apparently some very exciting (to those who
<br>
know the math!) quantitative things going on.  Let me see if I can
<br>
describe one of them (it'll be a test of whether I'm following the
<br>
book at all).
<br>
<p>In Chapter 8, &quot;More Dimensions Than Meets The Eye&quot;, the author
<br>
describes how impossible quantum-mechanical results (like negative
<br>
probabilities) can only be eliminated from supersymmetric string
<br>
theory if there are more degrees of freedom for strings to
<br>
vibrate in than the ordinary three spatial dimensions.  These
<br>
extra dimensions (first proposed as a purely philosophical
<br>
speculation by Theodor Kaluza in 1919) only make sense if they
<br>
are curled up too tightly for ordinary experimental probes of
<br>
distance to detect them, and there needs to be at least six of
<br>
them to cancel all of the nonsensical negative probabilities.
<br>
<p>These six extra curled-up dimensions could be &quot;attached&quot; to
<br>
each point of ordinary 3D space in a variety of topologies, but
<br>
it was proved in 1984 (by Candelas, Horowitz, Strominger and
<br>
Witten [heard of Edward Witten?  the author says some people think
<br>
he's the modern successor of Einstein, and others think he may
<br>
be the greatest physicist ever] that the physical requirements
<br>
of string theory restrict the geometrical form of the extra
<br>
dimensions to one of a large (numbering in the tens of thousands)
<br>
but not infinite class of possibilities called Calabi-Yau spaces.
<br>
These are not described much more precisely in the main body of
<br>
the text (apart from a rather impressionistic drawing), but Note 8
<br>
for this chapter says &quot;For the mathematically inclined reader,
<br>
we note that a Calabi-Yau manifold is a complex Kahler manifold
<br>
with vanishing first Chern class.  In 1957 Calabi conjectured
<br>
that every such manifold admits a Ricci-flat metric, and in
<br>
1977 Yau proved this to be true.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Chapter 10, &quot;Quantum Geometry&quot;, the author states that in 1988,
<br>
Lerche, Vafa, and Warner conjectured (&quot;based on aesthetic
<br>
arguments rooted in considerations of symmetry&quot;) that it might
<br>
be possible for two **different** Calabi-Yau shapes (chosen to
<br>
be the extra six curled-up dimensions of superstring theory) to
<br>
produce identical physics.  It had previously been demonstrated
<br>
by Candelas, Horowitz, Strominger and Witten that the the number
<br>
of families of elementary particles (as in the three that are known
<br>
today, where family 1 has the electron, family 2 has the muon, and
<br>
family 3 has the tau) depends on the total number of holes (of
<br>
whatever dimension) in the underlying Calabi-Yau space.
<br>
<p>Beginning in 1988, the author himself (together with Plesser) had begun
<br>
a project to explore a process of transforming one Calabi-Yau space into
<br>
another via a mathematical technique called orbifolding (invented in the
<br>
mid-80's by Dixon, Harvey, Vafa, and Witten), which interchanges
<br>
the number of odd- and even-dimensional holes in a Calabi-Yau
<br>
space but leaves the total number of holes (and hence the predicted
<br>
number of families of fundamental particles) unchanged.  I don't
<br>
know what it means for a hole to be odd- or even- dimensional, but
<br>
once again, Chapter 10 has a relevant Note 5: &quot;For the mathematically
<br>
inclined reader, we note that, more precisely, the number of families
<br>
of string vibrations is one-half the absolute value of the Euler
<br>
characteristic of the Calabi-Yau space, as mentioned in note 16 of
<br>
Chapter 9.  This is given by the absolute value of the difference
<br>
between h-super-2,1 and h-super-1,1, where h-super-p,q denotes the
<br>
(p,q) Hodge number.  Up to a numerical shift, these count the number
<br>
of nontrivial homology three-cycles ('three-dimensional holes') and
<br>
the number of homology two-cycles ('two-dimensional holes').  And
<br>
so, whereas we speak of the total number of holes in the main text,
<br>
the more precise analysis shows that the number of families depends
<br>
on the absolute value of the difference between the odd- and
<br>
even-dimensional holes.  The conclusion, however, is the same.
<br>
For instance, if two Calabi-Yau spaces differ by interchange of
<br>
their respective h-super-2,1 and h-super-1,1 Hodge numbers, the
<br>
number of particle families -- and the total number of 'holes' --
<br>
will not change.&quot;
<br>
<p>Later, the author (with Plesser) was able to demonstrate the stronger
<br>
result that these pairs of Calabi-Yau spaces with the numbers of
<br>
odd- and even-dimensional holes interchanged (which the author
<br>
terms &quot;mirror manifolds&quot;) not only give rise to the same number
<br>
of families of elementary particles, but will give rise to
<br>
**all** the same physical laws when used for the extra dimensions
<br>
of string theory (a rather strong claim, and not justified in much
<br>
more detail in the text.  The author does note that Yau described
<br>
his results as &quot;far too outlandish to be true&quot;).  Almost at the same
<br>
time, Candelas, Lynker and Schimmrigk, examining a large sample of
<br>
computer-generated Calabi-Yau spaces, found that &quot;almost&quot; all of
<br>
them came in pairs that differed only by the interchange of the numbers
<br>
of even- and odd-dimensional holes.
<br>
<p>HERE'S THE QUANTITATIVE STUFF:
<br>
<p>You remember how with differential equations, the Laplace transform
<br>
can be used to change a relatively difficult differential equation
<br>
into an equivalent algebraic equation, which can be easily solved,
<br>
following which the inverse Laplace transform can be used to turn
<br>
this solution into the solution of the original differential equation
<br>
(if I'm remembering this correctly, and not pipe-dreaming)?
<br>
<p>Well, it turns out that these pairs of mirror-manifolds can be
<br>
used as transforms to tame some of the difficult calculations involved
<br>
with superstring theory, because it sometimes turns out that a
<br>
calculation that is difficult or impossible to perform using one
<br>
Calabi-Yau space becomes much more tractable when the Calabi-Yau
<br>
space is transformed into its mirror-manifold partner.  This was
<br>
demonstrated by the author and Plesser, and by Candelas, de la Ossa,
<br>
Parkes and Green.  At a 1991 physics and mathematics conference in
<br>
Berkeley, it was revealed that Norwegian mathematicians Ellingsrud
<br>
and Stromme had produced a result (the hard way) from an elaborate
<br>
and difficult calculation to determine the number of spheres
<br>
that can be packed into a particular Calabi-Yau space.  The same
<br>
computation was performed by Candelas and his group via a much
<br>
simpler calculation based on the mirror-manifold method.
<br>
<p>At first, the results did not agree, but a month later the Norwegians
<br>
discovered and corrected a bug in their computer program, after which
<br>
the results agreed perfectly (the numerical result was
<br>
317,206,375).  Similar mathematical checks have been
<br>
performed many times since then, all with perfect agreement.
<br>
Also since then, mathematicians (Yau, Lian and Liu; with contributions
<br>
from Kontsevich, Manin, Tian, Li, and Givental) have elucidated
<br>
more of the mathematical foundatios of the symmetry of Calabi-Yau
<br>
spaces, and have produced a rigorous mathematical proof of the formulas
<br>
used by Candelas and the Norwegians used to count spheres inside
<br>
Calabi-Yau spaces.
<br>
<p>This quantitative work has more to do with pure math than physics,
<br>
although it used a new technique whose discovery was motivated by
<br>
physical considerations (the author says &quot;For quite some time,
<br>
physicists have 'mined' mathematical archives in search of tools
<br>
for constructing and analyzing models of the physical world.  Now,
<br>
through the discovery of string theory, physics is beginning to
<br>
repay the debt and to provide mathematicians with powerful new
<br>
approaches to their unsolved problems.&quot;).
<br>
<p>Cheers.

<p>Yes.  There was a EE professor at Caltech (R. V. Langmuir) who would

draw enormous circuit diagrams on the blackboard and envelop them with
<br>
pipe smoke &amp; Laplace transforms.  Being one-sided in time, they were
<br>
mainly good, IIRC, for calculating responses to transient
<br>
disturbances.
<br>
<p>----------------
<br>
<p>There is a long article in today's New York Times (in the Science
<br>
section; the business section is dominated by the Federal judge's
<br>
findings of law in the Microsoft anti-trust case) about a recent
<br>
development in superstring theory.  You can access this article
<br>
yourself on-line (it's free all day today) at www.nytimes.com.  The
<br>
physicists in question are from Princeton (a woman, and pretty, too --
<br>
shades of Greg Egan) and Stanford.  Let's see if I can attempt a
<br>
layman's summary (condensed from a journalist's version -- a blind man
<br>
painting a picture from a description given by another blind man)!
<br>
<p>You remember from Brian Greene's _The Elegant Universe_ how
<br>
superstring theory entails additional dimensions beyond the standard
<br>
three, on a very small linear scale (Planck length)?  Greene also
<br>
mentions that recent versions of superstring theory also contain
<br>
entities of higher dimension than strings, called &quot;branes&quot;.  Well,
<br>
apparently one story about our universe suggested by all this is that
<br>
the familiar universe is a 3-brane embedded in an extended (rather
<br>
than curled up) fourth dimension, with most of the familiar particles
<br>
of physics (including the force-carrying ones) composed of strings
<br>
confined to the surface of the brane, but with gravity (gravitons)
<br>
capable of escaping from the brane.  Apparently, a drawback to this
<br>
picture (up until now) is that this would entail gravity being
<br>
stronger than it is observed to be.  Well, apparently these two
<br>
physicists have come up with a geometry for the embedding space which
<br>
allows gravitons to move about in it while still constraining the
<br>
gravitational force to have its observed properties.
<br>
<p>This has two interesting consequences:
<br>
<p>1.  The &quot;missing mass&quot; of the universe may be matter embedded in other
<br>
branes.  This matter would be dark to us (because photons can't escape
<br>
from their native brane, only gravitons).
<br>
<p>2.  Gravitons which intersect our brane but which also extend into the
<br>
embedding space are heavier than &quot;normal&quot; gravitons confined to our
<br>
brane, and could be detected (indirectly) by the new generation of
<br>
accelerators (like the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva).  This
<br>
possiblility gives the Times article its title -- &quot;Physicists Finally
<br>
Discover a Way to Test the Superstring Theory&quot;.
