<em>&gt; &gt; The answer to this is not trivial, and it bears directly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussion on page 87 of Damien's updated version of The Spike. spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Lee Corbin has] ...that book, wherein on page 87, it is related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a certain ominous **Mr. Jones** has determined the rate...Lee
</em><br>
<p>Extropians, let me quickly introduce a new related topic with a new
<br>
subject line, then I need to run downtown and create a San Jose
<br>
restaurant map for our guests coming to E5.
<br>
<p>Im indebted to Martin Gardner for the following illustration:
<br>
A prisoner is sentenced to the ultimate punishment.  He is
<br>
told his execution will take place on some unspecified day,
<br>
Monday thru Friday inclusive.  The judge specifies that the
<br>
prisoner will not know which day he is to meet his fate until
<br>
the day of his demise.  Sitting forlornly in his cell, it occurs
<br>
to him that his date with destiny cannot be on Friday, for if
<br>
he is still among the living on Thursday midnight, then he
<br>
would *know* he is to be executed on Friday, which violates
<br>
the judge's stipulation that he will not know the date of his
<br>
execution.  Similarly, he cannot be executed on Thursday, for
<br>
he already determined his date cannot be Friday, so if he is
<br>
still with us on Wednesday midnight, then similarly Tuesday
<br>
midnight, and so on.
<br>
<p>The prisoner determines by this line of reasoning that his
<br>
execution cannot take place according to the judge's
<br>
instruction.  A greatly relieved prisoner is startled by the
<br>
hangman, who shows up Wednesday morning.
<br>
Surprise!
<br>
<p>Those that are following this thread and the previous
<br>
threads regarding probability of record primes, do ponder
<br>
this apparent paradox of the unexpected hanging so you
<br>
will be ready for where I am going with the notion of
<br>
probability distribution functions and their relationship
<br>
to the unexpected singularity.  Comments and questions
<br>
welcome in the meantime, while I go sample sushi
<br>
restaurants.  {8^D  0====   spike
