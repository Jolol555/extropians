<em>&gt; We've talked about using microsingularities as catalysts for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter-&gt;energy conversions before. One of the suggestions to generate them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was to focus giant energy densities on small regions of spacetime...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this time machine wannabee people say photons warp space more if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowed.
</em><br>
<p>(There's one thing I don't understand about this.  Photons don't &quot;really&quot;
<br>
get slowed when they pass through a material medium, whether a window pane
<br>
or a Bose-Einstein condensate.  At some level what happens is that they
<br>
are constantly absorbed and re-emitted, with the net effect of slowing
<br>
the wave front.  Relativistic effects don't normally slow down with
<br>
the slowed photons; you can go FTL in a material medium, for example,
<br>
which is what causes Cherenkov radiation.  So I don't see how slowing
<br>
photons in this artificial way can have any effects in terms of time
<br>
travel or other relativistic phenomena.)
<br>
<p>However my main point was that when I read your subject line I thought you
<br>
meant microSingularities, not miniature black holes.  A microSingularity
<br>
in the social sense would be a microscopic version of what we mean by
<br>
a Singularity.  What would that be?
<br>
<p>Imagine a discipline of Singularity Engineering.  Usually we think of a
<br>
Singularity as something which sweeps over a society, producing global
<br>
changes of an extraordinary degree.  But there could be many kinds
<br>
of Singularities.  It might be possible to alter the trajectory of a
<br>
society as it moves towards a Singularity and affect the outcome.
<br>
<p>This is essentially what Eliezer is trying to do with his Singularity
<br>
Institute.  He hopes to create a &quot;Friendly&quot; AI and have that lead to a
<br>
Friendly Singularity.  As the prospects for success improve, and other
<br>
people start to see the potential, they may set up their own rival
<br>
efforts to influence the Singularity in other ways.
<br>
<p>This leads to thinking of a Singularity as not being something which just
<br>
happens to us, but rather as something we can shape and control.  Maybe we
<br>
could start and stop our progress towards Singularity.  You could even
<br>
imagine a society which goes Singular for a while, then drops back into
<br>
a more historically normal state.  It would be like one of those comic
<br>
books where some guy can turn on super-powers for a while then goes back
<br>
to being ordinary.  What's that?  An asteroid coming to destroy the earth?
<br>
This looks like a job for... SuperHumanity!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this perspective, what would be a microSingularity?  It would be a
</em><br>
Singularity whose effects were limited.  Imagine an AI which had virtually
<br>
unlimited potentiality but which used its powers only in limited ways.
<br>
A genie which grants only three wishes, or a special-purpose machine
<br>
to view anywhere on earth in the distant past, might be examples.
<br>
You could have devices or regions with near-magical powers, without
<br>
necessarily seeing the entire cosmos restructured into a new form.
<br>
<p>Clearly, creating a microSingularity would be uncertain and risky and
<br>
could easily backfire.  It's not at all clear that you could create
<br>
a system with such incredible power and still hope to constrain it in
<br>
such specific ways.  Still, it's not fundamentally different from trying
<br>
to constrain an AI to be Friendly; it's just a finer level of control.
<br>
If Singularity Engineering is possible at all, it may be possible to
<br>
create microSingularities as well.
