</em><br>
<p>Hmm, why would a commitee be especially helpful? I think we are seeing a
<br>
bad trend right now in that many issues are being delegated to commitees
<br>
rather than being investigated and debated broadly - a commitee of
<br>
experts might have good ideas, but it might also be too narrow or
<br>
biased. The result is that many actually leave issues of ethics and
<br>
policy to others, rather than taking responsibility themselves.
<br>
<p>When it comes to neural interfacing, I don't think there will be any
<br>
shortage of people investigating and warning for dangers. In fact, given
<br>
how things currently are done I think there will be a serious shortage
<br>
of people looking for *benefits*. Neural interfacing is such a visceral
<br>
and philosophically, ethically and psychologically &quot;hot&quot; issue that
<br>
there will be no critic shortage. There might be a shortage of
<br>
constructive criticism, and this is where science courts and commitees
<br>
might be helpful. 
<br>
<p>The big problem is that what one considers a danger is another's
<br>
benefit. A common worry with transhumanist technologies when debated in
<br>
the media is that they threaten various deeply human values - even when
<br>
some of these values are not considered valuable by transhumanists (e.g.
<br>
accepting one's mortality). I have heard some people say that a drug
<br>
that has no side effects and no addiction risk would still be bad and
<br>
ought to be stopped, likely because some anti-hedonistic prejudice. How
<br>
do we handle this kind of situation? I think the best is to work for a
<br>
society where pluralism is accepted, and where most people can deal with
<br>
that other people do not necessarily share their ethics.
