<em>&gt; I doubt anyone in this list and most people outside it would prefer to
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; never existed if they knew they were part of a simulation made by people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that were much happier than we are.
</em><br>
<p>Count me among those who'd prefer never having lived at all to playing a
<br>
part in a simulation made by real (happy) people. Furthermore, their
<br>
happiness seems rather cheap if they get off on such tawdry shenanigans.
<br>
(I can write &quot;shenanigans&quot; 'cuz it's St. Pat's Day.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Despite all the misery that human life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does have, most people are still happy for being given a chance to live,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if they go through hell to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Do we speak for most people? It seems to me too many really smart people
<br>
commit suicide precisely because of the hell they go through. &quot;all the
<br>
misery that human life does have&quot; seems to function as a way to delete the
<br>
elite, i.e., some of the most intelligent among us (including Sasha).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what does it matter if the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that make the simulation think that the conditions in it are inhuman, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long as those in it are satisfied?
</em><br>
<p>It matters because simulating misery has no justifiable principle, and
<br>
simulated death (the fate of the simulacrums) does not correlate to
<br>
satisfaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides, if life was all happiness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would become bored. Otherwise, why would tragedy be so popular?
</em><br>
<p>Tragedy is popular because of schradenfreude.
<br>
&nbsp;If life was all happiness, boredom (by definition) would not exist.
<br>

free will
