<p>
In a recent e-mail to a friend, I remarked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another thing that crosses my mind from time to time...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is...  the **peculiarity** of the human prejudice that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence is desirable and important [*].  Sure, I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciate Kurzweil's curves of exponentially-increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity, and all that -- life on the edge of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envelope -- but look at all the greenery still lying about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grooving on Our Mr. Sun, without benefit of nervous systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all, thank you very much!  Only heterotrophs -- the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms that **cheated** by eating other organisms instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of soaking up the sun like good citizens (how's **that** for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a definition of original sin!) needed nervous systems, to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from other heterotrophs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And **carnivores** -- the heterotrophs that prey on other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heterotrophs, instead of just gobbling up the autotrophs, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the smartest (and most admired) of all [**].  I had a chance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to herd cows back in the '70's, and they're as dumb as posts!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Get them all lined up on the beaten path, like boxcars on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rail siding, and they're controllable, but if they stray off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this one-dimensional path, you'll spend an hour chasing them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They **deserve** to be eaten, damn it! ;-&gt;  No, it's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fang-bearers, like Rin Tin Tin, Lassie, Shere Khan, Bagheera,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Tony the Tiger that humans are crazy about.  Elephants are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; herbivores, and are still supposed to be smart, but I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; met an elephant in person, and I'm very skeptical!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the compost that gave rise to the flower of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence!
</em><br>
<p>McCrone acknowledges this in Chapter 12, &quot;Getting It
<br>
Backwards&quot; of _Going Inside_ (pp. 269-271), italics
<br>
**...** are mine:
<br>
<p>&quot;[C]onsciousness began with nervous systems that adapted
<br>
very slowly and which now can adapt very fast...  **It was
<br>
a simple product of a race between predator and prey**.
<br>
To begin with, both sides were slow-witted with limited
<br>
sense organs and limited manoeuvrability.  This meant they
<br>
could get away with a few reflex loops to slam shut a
<br>
shell or jet away from danger...
<br>
<p>But steadily the pace quickened.  To keep making the right
<br>
decisions, animals had to get more meaning out of each
<br>
moment...
<br>
<p>What defines consciousness in this most basic sense is the
<br>
ability of the brain to wrap itself around the moment.  The
<br>
evolutionary trend has been towards a more fluid, more
<br>
precisely adjusted response to each instant...
<br>
<p>It was a steady progression as new levels of plasticity
<br>
were added...  [A]s one layer was built atop another,
<br>
timescales kept shortening and the adapting also became
<br>
more global, until eventually the whole brain could
<br>
leap from one viewpoint to another in under a second.
<br>
One instant it might be wrapped around the thought of
<br>
smacking away an oncoming cricket ball, the next it could
<br>
be smarting at the embarrassment of having swung and
<br>
missed.  With a convulsive shift, the entire circuitry
<br>
of the brain would become aligned to produce a coherent
<br>
angle of view back into the latest moment.&quot;
<br>
<p>Grrr.  Arrgh.  [Mutant Enemy Productions]  ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>Jim F.
<br>
<p>[*]  Don't get me wrong!  I'm as addicted to speed
<br>
and complexity as anyone else on this list.
<br>
Ain't it **strange**, though?
<br>
<p>[**]  I had dinner with some friends recently, who
<br>
have two little boys, ages 4 and 6 (very **bright**
<br>
little boys -- their mother is a mathematician and
<br>
their father is a computer security expert, and
<br>
they're already on the computer).  Before going to
<br>
bed, the boys were given single-serving yogurts in
<br>
little plastic cups with animals on them.  The
<br>
six-year-old got a cup with a picture of a killer whale
<br>
on it, whereupon his little brother burst into tears.
<br>
When mommy offered to change his yogurt, the four-year-old
<br>
insisted through his tears that he needed a yogurt
<br>
with a **fierce** animal on it, to maintain parity
<br>
with his brother.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<p>I'm certainly not the only one who's noticed the oddness
<br>
of the human mania for intelligence.  There was, for example,
<br>
that wicked, wicked 1982 story by Bruce Sterling called
<br>
&quot;Swarm&quot; (it's one of the Shaper/Mechanist cycle,
<br>
included in the 1990 collection _Crystal Express_).
<br>
<p>TERRIBLE SPOILERS FOR &quot;SWARM&quot;!!!!
<br>
<p>The story concerns human contact with a mysterious,
<br>
seemingly non-sentient galactic hive organism called
<br>
the Swarm, comprised of castes of individual organisms
<br>
who are devolved descendants of ancient intelligent
<br>
races throughout the galaxy.  The surprise ending of the
<br>
story reveals that the swarm only wakens into intelligence
<br>
when it senses threat from outside interference (which
<br>
is not necessarily contact itself, but rather any sign
<br>
that the Swarm's placid existence is about to be co-opted
<br>
to serve the contacting race's own purposes).
<br>
<p>&quot;'What are you?'
<br>
<p>'I am the Swarm.  That is, I am one of its castes.  I am
<br>
a tool, an adaptation; my specialty is intelligence.
<br>
I am not often needed...
<br>
<p>Your companion's memories tell me that this is one of
<br>
those uncomfortable periods when galactic intelligence
<br>
is rife.  Intelligence is a great bother.  It makes
<br>
all kinds of trouble for us...
<br>
<p>You are a young race and lay great stock by your own
<br>
cleverness,' Swarm said, 'As usual, you fail to see
<br>
that intelligence is not a survival trait...
<br>
<p>This urge to expand, to explore, to develop, is just
<br>
what will make you extinct.  You naively suppose that you
<br>
can continue to feed your curiosity indefinitely.  It
<br>
is an old story, pursued by countless races before you...
<br>
<p>In a thousand years you will not even be a memory.
<br>
Your race will go the same way as a thousand others.'
<br>
<p>'And what way is that?'
<br>
<p>'I do not know...  They have passed beyond my ken.
<br>
They have all discovered something, learned something,
<br>
that has caused them to transcend my understanding.  It
<br>
may be that they even transcend **being**.  At any rate,
<br>
I cannot sense their presence anywhere.  They seem to
<br>
do nothing, they seem to interfere in nothing; for all
<br>
intents and purposes, they seem to be dead.  Vanished.
<br>
They may have become gods, or ghosts.  In either case,
<br>
I have no wish to join them...
<br>
<p>Intelligence is very much a two-edged sword...  It is
<br>
useful only up to a point.  It interferes with the business
<br>
of living.  Life, and intelligence, do not mix very well.
<br>
They are not at all closely related, as you seem to assume.
<br>
<p>'But you... are a rational being--'
<br>
<p>'I am a tool, as I said...  When you began your pheromonal
<br>
experiments, the chemical imbalance became apparent to the
<br>
Queen.  It triggered certain genetic patterns within her
<br>
body, and I was reborn.  Chemical sabotage is a problem
<br>
that can best be dealt with by intelligence...  Within
<br>
three days I was fully conscious.  Within five days I had
<br>
deciphered these markings on my body.  They are the
<br>
genetically encoded history of my race ... within five days
<br>
and two hours I recognized the problem at hand and knew what
<br>
to do.  I am now doing it.  I am six days old...
<br>
<p>We have not killed any of the fifteen other races we have
<br>
taken for defensive study.  It has not been necessary.
<br>
Consider that small scavenger floating by your head...
<br>
Five hundred million years ago its ancestors made the galaxy
<br>
tremble...
<br>
<p>We are doing you a favor, in all truth.  In a thousand
<br>
years your descendants here will be the only remnants of
<br>
the human race.  We are generous with our immortality;
<br>
we will take it upon ourselves to preserve you...'&quot;
