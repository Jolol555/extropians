<p>One might discover that one is &quot;handicapped&quot;, such as when men

get wired up to the perceptions of a woman with 4-color vision.

This doesn't prickle my feathers too much but I suspect others
<br>
are in for a rude awakening.

<p>Yes.  I think the mapping of subjective realities onto one another
<br>
to allow mind-communication, then the relaxing of the translation so
<br>
you get to experience the unmapped data is going to be a fascinating
<br>
area.  Its going to create lots of jobs for human &quot;translators&quot; and AI
<br>
agents and provide the basis for an interesting entertainment industry.
