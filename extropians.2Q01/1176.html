<p><em>&gt;If I had missed Extro-4, I would never have had the chance to Meet Sasha face to face (at least before the singularity.)  It's better late than never isn't it?&lt;
</em><br>
<p>We *can* produce a retro T-shirt for Extro-4.  It's not a problem for the design because it's already done.  This cost might be an issue, however.
<br>
<p>Thinking of Sasha: I was just looking at pictures in my scrap book of Sasha two days ago with e_Shaun.  I'd like a T-shirt covered with Sasha's words about Enhanced Reality or another essay and a picture from his famous Web site of &quot;Visionary Thinkers&quot; with his Sasha's face on it.  This is what I'd like to have in my collection of extropian T-shirts.  I miss dear Sasha very much.
