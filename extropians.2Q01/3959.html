<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, Robin's paper gives a rigorous mathematical proof that for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; two people to (a) disagree and (b) maintain their disagreement after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction, one or both of the parties must believe that they are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; likely to be rational than the other person.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This seems a bit strained to me.  That A has a strong argument for X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that I cannot defeat logically does not compell me to accept X at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time.  I may believe the argument leaves out something crucial than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have as yet been unable to identify.  ... It is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unlikely that only our conscious evaluations and adhering only to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at all points will generally bring us closer to truth in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you've missed the point.  My argument is not about responding to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments at all - it is about responding to opinions, and hence about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responding to all those unconscious processes you celebrate.  You have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious processes and so do they.  To prefer the output of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes to theirs you have to assume that you are more meta-rational.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have not &quot;celebrated&quot; anything, merely pointed out something I
<br>
believe has bearing.  I have no clear means to determine who is
<br>
and is not more &quot;meta-rational&quot;.   I have a more or less
<br>
informaed opinion about who I believe is more likely to be
<br>
correct in a given situation and on a given subject.
