<p><em>&gt;I'm sure this wasn't part of your train of thought in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your decision not to buy things that are made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;China, but here is some interesting reading:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The Role of U.S. Companies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In Denying Human and Worker Rights 
</em><br>

<p><em>&gt;Made in China:

<p>While not part of the current thread, this is an issue that does
<br>
concern me, and I vote with my wallet/moneyclip.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the info.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That wouldn't suprise me either, though I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the purpose of such an action wouldn't be to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economic action against politically unpopular nations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but rather to prevent economic action against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporations that produce products under shitty worker
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions and exceedingly low wages.  The WTO and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other such organizations, after all, exist for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefit of large corporations, not governments.
</em><br>
<p>There are growing numbers of us that take these issues to heart. I
<br>
have long thought about starting a retail store where everything
<br>
available was &quot;Made In America&quot;. I think these would prove far more
<br>
popular than many people think.
