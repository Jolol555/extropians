<p>Maybe I'm setting the standards a bit high, but I would say a &quot;mover and

shaker&quot; starts at -- arbitrarily set -- 100 megabucks of net worth (and
<br>
growing visibly as we speak) or people above people turn to advice. With
<br>
very few possible exceptions, I don't see such people on any lists I
<br>
frequent. No, I don't think they're lurking, and even through proxy. I
<br>
readily believe they do use email and web, but they don't do lists, unless
<br>
they're very elite, and informal, consisting of a few addresses in the
<br>
mail headers.

<p><em>&gt; moving and shaking), and I've seen interesting things on other lists. Very

<em>&gt; busy people may not themselves read the list, but they may have someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monitor it. For example, on the Motley Fool board devoted to discussing
</em><br>
<p>Investor lists, yes. We're not an investor list, though. We're regarded as
<br>
fringe futurists, high volume, low signal-noise, at a time where busy
<br>
professionals and academics are avoiding online fora -- which they once
<br>
frequented -- like the plague, due to Net attracting mainstream (instead
<br>
of former elites) and lack of social feedback silencing mechanisms; we do
<br>
really need foolproof adaptive reputation based filtering infrastructure,
<br>
and badly so.
<br>
<p>Can you imagine Minsky (not that I'm a personal fan of the man, quite the
<br>
opposite, but he'll do as an example) coming back, right now, even as
<br>
lurker? This is not a phenomenon specific to extropians@, I'm seeing this
<br>
trend across all lists for years. It's a wonder these things are still
<br>
around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Celera, it became very clear that Craig Venter had either read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messages, or some collection of them.
</em><br>
<p>Venter would be a fool not to read the Fool. It's an investment barometer,
<br>
and even a veritable investment climate kitchen (lots of butterflies,
<br>
watching other butterflies). Would Venter read extropians@?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will leave addressing the function of this list and its improvement for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another time. But one thing I *still* want to do is for ExI to offer a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roster of specialized email forums (Web-based preferably). Those more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focused forums might attract busy people more than this list, which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch-all.
</em><br>
<p>I hope any of you Javien people listening are cooking up something nice.
<br>
If you do really have a painless reputation based filtering in the
<br>
works...
