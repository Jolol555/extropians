<p>I find the following a typical bizarre pseudo-argument.
<br>
<p>===========
<br>
<p>There appears to be little fear that human cloning will have a significant
<br>
effect in sport. If say, Michael Johnson were cloned, the result would
<br>
almost certainly not be the same world record-setter as the original,
<br>
researchers say, because environmental, nutritional and motivational
<br>
factors also play significant roles in developing athletes.
<br>
<p>&quot;If I'm the clone of Michael Johnson, I've got to bend myself into all
<br>
sorts of shapes to run, because genetically that's what I'm destined to
<br>
be,&quot; Dr. Friedmann said. &quot;I run and run and run, and I can't ever get
<br>
anywhere. Then what am I? I'm a Michael Johnson who can't run. That's a
<br>
nobody. That must be a crushing experience to
<br>
learn you're not what you're genetically destined to be.&quot;
<br>
<p>===================
<br>
<p>I agree with the general moral sentiment, and that cloning will seldom
<br>
yield a xerox copy, partly due to stochastic developmental cascades, party
<br>
because of the factors listed in the 1st par. BUT having allowed this, how
<br>
likely is the scenario in the 2nd? From infancy you are given this (perhaps
<br>
soul-destroying) enhanced environment to make you MJ Mark II, and even so
<br>
you *can't ever get anywhere. Then what am I?* What indeed? A proof that
<br>
god intervenes deliberately to turn one twin into a nebbish just to spite
<br>
impious cloners? This is question-begging of a remarkable order, I reckon.
<br>
<p>It might be true of an Einstein, of course, since it's surely harder to
<br>
replicate the unknowable experiences of a genius, and the multiple genes
<br>
involved in creative intelligence presumably offer vastly more stochastic
<br>
pathways to go haring off in different ways.
