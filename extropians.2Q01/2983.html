<p>Um, ischemia is not a synonym of cryonics. It's a particular damage mechanism
<br>
which occurs in the biological tissue at stopped blood flow. Of course
<br>
ischemia management is of great relevance to cryonics, but that's another
<br>
issue entirely.
<br>
<p>As to calling patients &quot;dead&quot; let's agree to disagree. Of course they're
<br>
dead to the classical medicine (particularly, after you pumped them full
<br>
of toxic chemicals and froze them stiff), but you're running in explanation
<br>
problems, as to why you still keep all the pop- and momsicles who're past 
<br>
their expiration date, as you yourself admitted (&quot;Cryonics patients are DEAD&quot;).
<br>
<p>It's much easier to tell &quot;no, they're probably not dead, but they're so 
<br>
beyond the current state of the art we can't fix them yet, so that's we 
<br>
inflict this extra damage on them occuring in the suspension process, 
<br>
so that akk further changes are arrested, and we've stabilized them so well 
<br>
we can afford to wait for kiloyears for the art to improve, if it needs be&quot;.
