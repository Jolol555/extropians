<p>If the libertarians are the only one demanding openness, accountability
<br>
and transparency, then of course nothing will happen - everybody knows
<br>
they are weird gun nuts, and now apparently camera nuts too ;-) But
<br>
these issues interest far more people than that, and when you phrase
<br>
them into terms of controlling corruption, the right to document ones
<br>
life to prevent false accusations and especially forcing governments
<br>
into accountability, then you will be part of a far larger group than
<br>
just the libertarians.
<br>
<p>I have noted that it is quite common to ascribe some sort of
<br>
well-executed evil agenda to the governments, as if they were the clever
<br>
bad guys in some Hollywood production. Reification, anyone? Governments
<br>
change policies in response to public demands - not perfectly, and
<br>
sometimes with a notable resistance, but it does happen all the time.
<br>
Governments often try to impose their values on society, but that is
<br>
also an imperfect process that is definitely getting harder. People are
<br>
not as manageably uninformed as they once were.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In some sense, I think Bill Joy is quite right. I don't think humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is capable of using nanotechnology/genetic engineering/etc without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good chance of at least some local disasters. So, I can see the need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police-state like ULE to prevent such disasters.
</em><br>
<p>I think such a police state would *promote* local disasters. It creates
<br>
a false complacency, sets up an organisation that is not very
<br>
accountable , has plenty of temptations to misuse its abilities while
<br>
few incentives to keep to its original agenda of tech protection. 
<br>
<p>Local disasters will likely occur. But as long as we can keep them local
<br>
it is worth it. The danger comes from not being willing to risk *any*
<br>
risk - which would mean a halt to any research and innovation - and
<br>
setting up bad institutions that will not lower risks while hurting
<br>
openness. There is a real danger than a spectacular nanodisaster would
<br>
make these bad solutions politically popular; the best way of combatting
<br>
it is to make people understand the value of open societies, why these
<br>
solutions don't work and involve them in creating their own open
<br>
solutions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Getting people involved might be initiated via a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future-shock-inducing memetic campaigns.
</em><br>
<p>Future shock usually makes people freeze and do... nothing. &quot;Oh dear,
<br>
things are so complicated these days&quot; Just look at how people reacted to
<br>
the Internet, plenty of the reactions were resigned or applied ideas
<br>
that clearly were old and inapplicable (like the decency laws) since
<br>
they had no new ideas. Hence I think inducing future shock is extremely
<br>
dangerous, because it makes people give their power to whatever experts
<br>
or politicians they think know the answers rather than thinking and
<br>
taking responsibility themselves.
