<p>Very disappointing.  Not too surprising for a first crack at
<br>
this sort of thing, I guess (though tragic for some of the

patients -- a sobering lesson for the folks on this list).

<p>Parkinson's Research Is Set Back by Failure of Fetal Cell
<br>
Implants
<br>
<p>By GINA KOLATA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carefully controlled study that tried to treat Parkinson's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disease by implanting cells from aborted fetuses into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patients' brains not only failed to show an overall benefit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also revealed a disastrous side effect, scientists
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report.
<br>
<p>In about 15 percent of patients, the cells apparently grew too
<br>
well, churning out so much of a chemical that controls movement
<br>
that the patients writhed and jerked uncontrollably.
<br>
<p>The researchers say that while some patients have similar effects
<br>
from taking too high a dose of their Parkinson's drug, in this
<br>
case the drugs did not cause the symptoms and there is no way to
<br>
remove or deactivate the transplanted cells.
<br>
<p>On the researchers' advice, six patients who enrolled in the
<br>
study but who had not yet had the implantation operation have
<br>
decided to forgo it.
<br>
<p>The results, reported today in The New England Journal of
<br>
Medicine, are a severe blow to what has been considered a highly
<br>
promising avenue of research for treating Parkinson's disease,
<br>
Alzheimer's disease and other neurological ailments. The study
<br>
indicates that the simple solution of injecting fetal cells into
<br>
a patient's brain may not be enough to treat complex diseases
<br>
involving nerve cells and connections that are poorly
<br>
understood. Some say it is time to go back to the laboratory and
<br>
to animals before doing any more operations on humans.
<br>
<p>The findings may also fuel the debate over whether it is
<br>
appropriate to use tissue from aborted fetuses to treat
<br>
diseases. Despite their disappointment, some researchers said
<br>
they hoped that the results would not bring fetal cell research
<br>
to an abrupt halt. The research has been controversial because
<br>
the fetal cells were obtained from abortion clinics.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is still our one great hope for a cure,&quot; said
<br>
Dr. J. William Langston, who is scientific director and chief
<br>
executive officer at The Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale,
<br>
Calif.
<br>
<p>Parkinson's disease occurs when cells of the substantia nigra
<br>
region in the base of the brain die, for unknown reasons. The
<br>
hope was that fetal substantia nigra cells might take over for
<br>
them. But, the study showed, in older patients the operation had
<br>
no benefit and in some younger patients, the transplants brought
<br>
on nightmarish side effects.
<br>
<p>Although the paper depicts the patients with the side effects in
<br>
impassive clinical terms, doctors who have seen them paint a very
<br>
different picture.
<br>
<p>Dr. Paul E. Greene, a neurologist at the Columbia University
<br>
College of Physicians and Surgeons and a researcher in the study,
<br>
said the uncontrollable movements some patients suffered were
<br>
&quot;absolutely devastating.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;They chew constantly, their fingers go up and down, their wrists
<br>
flex and distend,&quot; Dr. Greene said. And the patients writhe and
<br>
twist, jerk their heads, fling their arms about.
<br>
<p>&quot;It was tragic, catastrophic,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a real
<br>
nightmare. And we can't selectively turn it off.&quot;
<br>
<p>One man was so badly affected that he could no longer eat and had
<br>
to use a feeding tube, Dr. Greene said. In another, the condition
<br>
came and went unpredictably throughout the day, and when it
<br>
occurred, the man's speech was unintelligible.
<br>
<p>For now, Dr. Greene said, his position is clear: `No more fetal
<br>
transplants. We are absolutely and adamantly convinced that this
<br>
should be considered for research only. And whether it should be
<br>
research in people is an open question.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach, who was director of the National
<br>
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which sponsored
<br>
the study, said that while the operation had been promoted by
<br>
some neurosurgeons as miraculous, this was the first time it was
<br>
rigorously evaluated. It used sham surgery as a comparison, a
<br>
controversial and rarely used strategy but one that researchers
<br>
felt was necessary to understand the true effects of the
<br>
operation.
<br>
<p>Dr. Fischbach, who is now dean of the faculty of medicine at the
<br>
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, was the
<br>
director of the institute only at the end of the study.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ad hoc reports of spectacular results can always occur,&quot;
<br>
Dr. Fischbach said. &quot;But if you do these studies systematically,
<br>
this is the result you get.&quot;
<br>
<p>The surgery, he added, &quot;is not the final solution that people
<br>
would have hoped going into it.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the study, researchers, led by Dr. Curt R. Freed of the
<br>
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and
<br>
Dr. Stanley Fahn of the Columbia University College of Physicians
<br>
and Surgeons, recruited 40 patients, ages 34 to 75, who had had
<br>
Parkinson's disease for an average of 14 years. The patients were
<br>
randomly assigned to have substantia nigra cells from four
<br>
fetuses implanted in their brains or to have sham surgery, for
<br>
comparison.
<br>
<p>The surgery took place in Colorado and the patients were
<br>
evaluated in New York. The fetal cell surgery involved drilling
<br>
four small holes in the patient's forehead and then inserting
<br>
long needles through the holes into the brain and injecting fetal
<br>
cells. The sham surgery involved drilling the holes but not
<br>
injecting needles into the brain. After a year, the patients were
<br>
told whether they had the fetal cell surgery and, if not, they
<br>
were offered it if they wanted it.
<br>
<p>The study's primary measure of success was whether the patients
<br>
themselves noticed that they were better, as determined by a
<br>
survey that they mailed in a year later but before they knew
<br>
whether they had had fetal cell implants or a sham operation. The
<br>
study found no difference between the two groups — neither
<br>
those who had had the fetal cell operation nor those who had had
<br>
the sham surgery noticed an improvement in their symptoms.
<br>
<p>Other tests, like neurologists' assessments of the patients while
<br>
they were taking their medication and the patients' assessments
<br>
of their condition in diaries they kept also showed no effect of
<br>
the surgery. And there was no difference between the two groups
<br>
in the doses of drugs needed to control the disease.
<br>
<p>The one glimmer of hope came from assessments by neurologists
<br>
before the patients had had their first dose of medication in the
<br>
morning. By that measure, the 10 patients under age 60 who had
<br>
had the fetal cell implants seemed better than those who had had
<br>
sham surgery, with less rigidity, although their tremor was just
<br>
as bad.
<br>
<p>Dr. Freed hailed that result, saying, &quot;It was a clear-cut
<br>
improvement.&quot;
<br>
<p>And, he added, the fetal cells survived in most patients' brains.
<br>
<p>&quot;I would be disappointed if people used a strict clinical trial
<br>
approach,&quot; Dr. Freed said. &quot;This study is about multiple
<br>
phenomena.&quot;
<br>
<p>Others were less enthusiastic, pointing out that finding
<br>
subgroups after the fact who may have benefited suggests a
<br>
hypothesis for future studies, not evidence of an effect.
<br>
<p>&quot;We try to teach everybody that you have to identify beforehand
<br>
what's the primary outcome,&quot; said Dr. William Weiner, the
<br>
director of the Maryland Parkinson's Disease and Movement
<br>
Disorder Center and a professor of neurology at the University of
<br>
Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, referring to the
<br>
measure of success determined before the study began. &quot;In this
<br>
case, they picked a subjective assessment by the patients
<br>
themselves, which I think is a very good one.&quot;
<br>
<p>And so, Dr. Weiner said, when the patients noticed no
<br>
improvement, &quot;the study was negative.&quot;
<br>
<p>In addition, Dr. Langston said, even if a subsequent study
<br>
confirmed that the surgery had an effect on the condition in
<br>
younger patients before they took their medicine in the morning,
<br>
and even if there was a way of preventing the terrible side
<br>
effect, the operation would still hardly be a
<br>
breakthrough. Parkinson's disease is almost always a disease of
<br>
the elderly, he noted, adding that well under 10 percent of
<br>
patients who would be candidates for the surgery are younger than
<br>
60.
<br>
<p>The wiggling and writhing movements first emerged a year after
<br>
the operation, showing up in five of the younger patients who had
<br>
at first appeared to benefit from fetal cell surgery — three
<br>
who had the operation in the initial phase of the study and two
<br>
who had it a year later, when they learned that they had
<br>
originally had a sham surgery. While doctors sometimes see such
<br>
effects in Parkinson's patients, it is caused by giving too much
<br>
of drugs that act like dopamine in the brain. And it can be
<br>
controlled by reducing the drugs.
<br>
<p>In this case, however, drugs were not the culprit. Even when
<br>
doctors took away the drugs, the symptoms persisted.
<br>
<p>The fetal implant study had been controversial from the start,
<br>
both because it included sham surgery and because it used fetal
<br>
tissue from abortions. But many Parkinson's disease experts said
<br>
it had to be done because doctors were already offering the
<br>
surgery to patients, and charging them for it, at costs of
<br>
$40,000 or more, with no evidence that they were helping
<br>
them. Yet patients, facing a disease in which brain cells slowly
<br>
and inexorably die and in which even the drugs that once
<br>
controlled their symptoms of tremor and rigidity would inevitably
<br>
fail, took their chances with the operation, thinking they had
<br>
little to lose.
<br>
<p>Dr. Freed said he was the first in the United States to offer the
<br>
treatment, starting in 1988 with a 52-year- old man, who is still
<br>
alive although, of course, he also still has Parkinson's disease.
<br>
<p>Dr. Freed continued to offer it to paying patients while he was
<br>
treating those who were part of the federal study and whose
<br>
procedures were paid for by the study. He said he considered
<br>
these other operations research because he experimented with
<br>
different amounts and placements of fetal cells. He has given
<br>
fetal cell implants to 27 patients, he said, with the most recent
<br>
operation last October.
<br>
<p>Dr. Freed said his group was now implanting less fetal tissue and
<br>
putting the tissue in a different area of the brain, hoping to
<br>
avoid the devastating side effects. But, he said it would be a
<br>
mistake to stop doing the surgery altogether.
<br>
<p>&quot;To say that you can't do or shouldn't do human research because
<br>
the research has uncertain outcome, I think would be a bad
<br>
decision,&quot; Dr. Freed said.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, a second federally financed study of the operation is
<br>
winding to a close, and some researchers say it is time to go
<br>
back to animal studies and learn more about the complex roles of
<br>
the brain cells involved in Parkinson's disease.
<br>
<p>Dr. Weiner said that if a patient came to him today seeking
<br>
advice, he would say: &quot;The bottom line for patients is that human
<br>
fetal cell transplants are not currently the best way to go. If
<br>
you are willing to pay for them, you can still have them
<br>
done. But my advice is you ought not to do this.&quot;
