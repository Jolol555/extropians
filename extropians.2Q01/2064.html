<p>Inflation = increase in money supply above demand.  Do you agree?  In free
<br>
banking, a bank clearing with other banks is one of the ways it would notice
<br>
its inflating. (Actually, just outflow of reserves would be enough.  These
<br>
might be caused by clearings from other banks or by depositors redeeming
<br>
their notes for reserves.  The latter might even happen en masse as in a
<br>
classic run.)

<p><em>&gt; All true;  but none of this is related to the herd mentality problem.

</em><br>
<p>By making them less efficient, it would contribute to an unstable system.
<br>
Shocks and changes that would be easily absorbed under free banking would be
<br>
harder to adjust to under the highly regulated regime in the US prior to
<br>
1913 when the Federal Reserve System started.
<br>
<p>Limiting banks's actions and structure would contribute to them being more
<br>
alike than different.  Also, some specific limits I mention, especially
<br>
those on branch banking, would make it harder for more experienced and
<br>
larger banks to expand.  This would definitely contribute to a &quot;herd
<br>
mentality.&quot;  Inexperienced people often follow the herd, as we notice now
<br>
during and after the dot-com boom.  (The more experienced investors did not
<br>
get onbound as much as the neophytes.  Their selection criteria seemed to be
<br>
much more sophisticated than &quot;Buy any tech now!&quot; or &quot;But IPOs no matter
<br>
what!&quot;)  I thought that obvious.
<br>
<p>For more on this, see &quot;Is Free Banking More Prone to Bank Failures than
<br>
Regulated Banking?&quot; by Kam Hon Chu at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj16n1-3.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj16n1-3.html</a>  (The bibliography is also
<br>
useful there, though, if you've ignored my other web citings, especially
<br>
Kevin Dowd's site, I don't see why this one will be given attention.:)
<br>
<p>Actually, Chu, paraphrasing George Benston, goes over, more succinctly than
<br>
I, the problems of bank regulation, i.e., of non-free banking:
<br>
<p>&quot;First, regulations constrain banks' diversification by limiting banks'
<br>
portfolio choices or by restricting branching, thus reducing the flexibility
<br>
of banks to accommodate unanticipated shocks. Second, as implicit taxes,
<br>
regulations reduce banks' profitability. Third, regulations often create a
<br>
moral hazard problem by encouraging risk taking. Fourth, while it may be the
<br>
intention of the regulatory authorities to promote banking stability by
<br>
interventions through monitoring, supervising, and preventing fraud and
<br>
grossly incompetent management, it is usually the case that supervision is
<br>
inadequate.&quot;  (At above link.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Data does vary by country, which is why I put in the &quot;relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent&quot; caveat.
</em><br>
<p>It's still debateable whether apolitical is what the FRS is.  I see, to a
<br>
great extent, an institution in the throes of regulatory capture by the
<br>
stockholders and other major debtors.  (Regulatory capture is where the
<br>
regulator gets winds up pandering to one group or set of groups, such as the
<br>
FDA being heavily influenced by the drug industry.)  The Mexican bailout of
<br>
the early 1990s -- just after NAFTA was enacted -- and the more recent
<br>
bailout of LTCM are examples of this capture.  Sort of the principle of
<br>
&quot;what's good for [well connected and often rich] debtors is good for the
<br>
whole economy&quot; being applied.  (My implication here is that these debtors in
<br>
a free market would have went belly up or their creditors would suffered,
<br>
making all less wary of taking stupid risks.  Instead, the Fed and other
<br>
government institutions helped to reinforce taking such risks because some
<br>
sort of relief is always available, especially to the bigger risk takers.
<br>
In other words, if you win you win and if you lose you win.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the US case, growth volatility has been much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less after the Fed came in than before.
</em><br>
<p>But if you believe this is so, how much of that volatility was caused by
<br>
banking regulations?  If you're going to stick with the US case, you have to
<br>
find a way to separate between the effects of regulation and what would have
<br>
happened under a free banking system.  This is why I used the example of
<br>
Scotland prior to the Bank of England takeover in 1844.
<br>
<p>See also Kevin Dowd's _Money and Market: Essays on Free Banking_, especially
<br>
chapter 7 -- &quot;Are free markets the cause of financial instability?&quot; -- which
<br>
available on the cheap from Laissez Faire Books,
<br>
<a href="http://www.laissezfairebooks.com/">http://www.laissezfairebooks.com/</a>  (The list price for the book is $100,
<br>
LFB sells it for $27.95.  They must have a rich uncle or something.:)  A lot
<br>
of instability is caused not by markets per se but by government attempts to
<br>
regulate them to a hopefully better outcome.  (Or, admittedly, there are
<br>
times when regulators are just out to help their buddies, but even if this
<br>
wasn't the case regulation generally leads to worse outcomes.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With the Fed, we had the deflation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the 30' and the inflation of the 70's, which I agree would not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on nearly so long under market systems.  The Bundesbank has never had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that kind of major goof in 50 years.  No &quot;myriad inflations&quot; here, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Japan, Germany, or Switzerland.
</em><br>
<p>In the US, what about the 1920s prior to the Great Depression?  What about
<br>
1999?  What about 1980, where the money base alone increase over 300%?  (See
<br>
&quot;Does the Fed Fight Inflation?&quot; by Frank Shostak at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=428&FS=+Does+the+Fed+Fight+Inflat">http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=428&FS=+Does+the+Fed+Fight+Inflat</a>
<br>
ion%3F )
<br>
<p>In fact, the whole last century was inflationary.  See &quot;Central Banks, Gold,
<br>
and the Decline of the Dollar&quot; by Robert Batemarco at
<br>
<a href="http://www.fee.org/freeman/95/Batemarco.html">http://www.fee.org/freeman/95/Batemarco.html</a> on this.  Batemarco claims &quot;The
<br>
quantity of U.S. money has increased year in and year out every year since
<br>
1933.&quot;  (This is, of course, only a rough measure of inflation.  After all,
<br>
the demand for money might also have increased every year.  Even so, it's
<br>
notable that the jump in increase happened through Fed action and has not
<br>
abated.  The rate of increase might vary, but not the direction.  Meaning,
<br>
we go from inflation to hyperinflation to inflation -- not inflation to
<br>
deflation.)
<br>
<p>Also, what about Germany during the early 1920s?  What about Germany during
<br>
the late 1920s and early 1930s?  (I need not even, I hope, need to mention
<br>
France, Italy, Latin America, or Africa.)  I am not yet familiar enough with
<br>
the Swiss and current German examples.  The Japanese one is one of inflation
<br>
from what I've read, though only of mild to moderate inflation, which is
<br>
still bad.  (The current deflation there actually seems to be an example of
<br>
just cutting back the usual rate of inflation, rather than a true deflation.
<br>
Deflation = decrease in money supply below demand for money.  In other
<br>
words, the direction of monetary increase has changed.  This is sort of like
<br>
how the US government didn't stop growing during the 1990s; it just didn't
<br>
grow as fast as it had been.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Free banking, then, would increase short-term volatility compared to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current system while protecting from long-term mismanagement.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt this.  In fact, I think free banking would prevent most long run
<br>
mismanagement -- &quot;most&quot; because no system is perfect -- because it gives
<br>
proper short run signals (reserve outflows and inflows), allows for quick,
<br>
local reactions to changes in the demand for money and time preferences
<br>
(each bank setting its portfolio, reserve, interest rate, etc.), and
<br>
provides proper incentives to make those changes (profit and loss).  These
<br>
signals just do not exist under FRS or any central bank.  Also, the
<br>
incentive is not there for central bankers.  In fact, the incentive is to
<br>
inflate, which is why we have long periods of inflation punctuated mostly by
<br>
ones of  hyperinflation.  (The value, e.g., of the dollar declined over most
<br>
of the 20th century in real terms.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more important is not immediately clear.  Further, the Fed
</em><br>
hyper-deflated
<br>
<em>&gt; *once* and hyper-inflated *once* and now seems acutely aware of both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risks.  The chance of a repeat occurance should be less than the once-in-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 40 years we got in this century.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  Free banks almost constitutionally can't hyperinflate or
<br>
hyperdeflate.  It would spell doom for any one of them that did.  Free
<br>
banks, also, can hardly inflate or deflate.  Either would be unprofitable
<br>
and they have the correct signals not to make those mistakes -- or make them
<br>
for too long.  (Granted, new or incompetent banks might do this, but the
<br>
correction would be swift.  Also, depositors would be wary of putting their
<br>
funds in banks they didn't think would be stable and profitable.  This is an
<br>
important point.  Government backed deposit insurance right now really has
<br>
stifled the learning process.  Today, most depositors do not even think
<br>
about the stability or management of the bank they put their funds in --
<br>
except for larger depositors.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (to be fair, you could make a case that short-term volatility has
</em><br>
long-term
<br>
<em>&gt; benefits.  But you do have to demonstrate that first.)
</em><br>
<p>See above.  See especially the Dowd article.  I think one has to prove that
<br>
central banks can actually being stable and promote growth -- real growth,
<br>
not inflationary booms -- in both the long and short runs.  Power and
<br>
control of other people, IMO, should never be condoned without a thorough
<br>
examination.  Central banking is merely one instance of such control.
<br>
