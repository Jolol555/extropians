<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...the belief that one's own personality is important enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to take extreme measures to preserve from nonexistence strikes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me as -- unseemly, somehow...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and yet would, if faced with conventional death, take as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many extreme measures as the rest of us would.  I've heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this meme before---&quot;my personality isn't important enough&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and can only conclude that it's because the cost of cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>My personality of the moment truly isn't all that important.
<br>
The time and opportunity to change it many times, to grow
<br>
and learn without particular limit *is* that important.
<br>
I am not limited to my personality.  
<br>
<p>I do not necessarily believe that even my concept of that
<br>
most intimate of conglomerate illusions, &quot;I&quot;, is invariant
<br>
or deserving of being preserved indefinitely or that it 
<br>
would be preserved indefinitely even if continuity of 
<br>
memories and such goes on indefinitely.  &quot;I&quot; over time
<br>
would change in ways that would seem very &quot;not-I&quot; today. 
<br>
<p>Even this concept of &quot;me&quot; as distinct from &quot;others&quot; in
<br>
quite this way is open to change and modification given
<br>
time enough.  I want that time and the opportunity to
<br>
witness all of these changes and much more.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yet that can't explain it, because Jim and those like him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually endorse extreme but conventional medical operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are even more expensive.  No, somehow the mind-set that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says that we are only supposed to be here for three score
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ten has taken another victim, possibly fatally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As he thoroughly explained in another post, Jim is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enamored of future technologies, and would eagerly pay for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Krell brain-boosts or retinal projectors.  (I do note that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these options are safely unavailable now.)  But the deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge for cryonicists and other extropians is to try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand what is really going on here.  It beats me.
</em><br>
<p>If I thought I was stuck with me just as I am now, warts
<br>
and all, for an indefinite period extending away into 
<br>
infinity, then I would not find that very appealing.  It is
<br>
not death so much that I seek to avoid but the end of becoming
<br>
and being.  I am not done with that and don't plan to be done.
