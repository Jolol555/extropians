&quot; If our descendants tend to be more interested in simulating &quot;pivotal&quot;
<br>
people and events from their history, then you should raise your estimate of
<br>
the chances that the events and people around you will be considered pivotal
<br>
to your descendants. You should also try to encourage this to happen, as it
<br>
will make the simulators less likely to drop you from their simulation, or
<br>
to end that simulation. If you can identify an especially interesting event
<br>
around you, you might also try to prevent it from ending, as the simulation
<br>
might end soon after the event does. &quot;
<br>
<p>If our descendants are interested in at least a single blind study then our
<br>
world may be coming to an end.  By single blind here I mean that we do not
<br>
know, or believe there is a reasonable degree of probability, that we are
<br>
living in a simulated world. We have good evidence that if we are in a
<br>
simulation then our descendents want the simulation to be at least single
<br>
blind. For on the one hand, if they want to let on that it was a simulation
<br>
they could give us some pretty direct evidence (think of the  matrix). On
<br>
the other hand, if the simulation is not single blind then this might effect
<br>
their experimental results--for of course we might start acting differently.
<br>
So, even if you think or know this is a simulation you ought not to act
<br>
differently for fear that the experimental protocol will be aborted. Indeed,
<br>
if someone were to post the suggestion publicly about the possibility of
<br>
acting differently, given the probability that this is a simulation, this
<br>
might bring about a quick end to the simulation. An end to this simulation
<br>
would be an end to our world. So, the guy that makes that post will be the
<br>
one who is responsible for the end of our world. I am trying to remember the
<br>
name of that guy that is thought to be the harbinger of the end of the
<br>
world. Mark.
