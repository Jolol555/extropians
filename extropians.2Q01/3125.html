No. They're decoupling the publishing from the reviewing.
<br>
In times where publishing was more expensive than reviewing,
<br>
it made sense to review BEFORE to publish, so as to avoid waste.

In times where publishing is free and reviewing as expensive as ever,

Once works are published in a reliable place, it's easy for anyone
<br>
to make competing review committees, with a free market for reviewing.

&quot;Before we end state planification, I'd like to have a thoroughly solved,
<br>
tested, and debugged model of how the market will solve all these economic
<br>
problems.&quot; Sounds oxymoronic to me. The very reason why we must let the
<br>
market do it is because there is no way it could be done in a centralized
<br>
way by any kind of benevolent authority (even assuming such thing exists).

The [classical] liberal, of course, does not deny that there are

some superior people - he is not an egalitarian - but he denies
<br>
that anyone has authority to decide who these superior people are.
