<p>Hola Amigos. This is a letter I sent to the guy who runs this site...
<br>
<a href="http://ga.to/children/">http://ga.to/children/</a>
<br>
(Children's Questions About Napster)
<br>
I highly recommend reading some of this guy's essays, because a thoughtful
<br>
adversary is much more valuable than a blind partisan. Basically it's a
<br>
number of well-researched and non-emotional criticisms of Napster and the
<br>
whole &quot;intellectual property is dead&quot; meme. Nonetheless, I think I have a
<br>
couple of questions that will stump even this guy, so I went ahead and sent
<br>
them in. Because I didn't want my procrastination to go to waste, I thought
<br>
I'd send a copy of my questions to you folks as well...

<p>How do you propose to prop up copyright laws?
<br>
<p>You've actually made some of the most intelligent anti-piracy arguments I've seen so far. Kudos. I have three questions. Good luck answering them. :-)
<br>
<p>1. Give one scheme of keeping current intellectual property laws
<br>
enforceable without implementing legal and technical measures that can
<br>
(and therefore eventually will) be abused as censorship and
<br>
anti-privacy measures.
<br>
<p>2. The bottom line is that posession is 9/10ths. The reason that GM or
<br>
Dell or McDonald's stay in business is that it's easier for them to
<br>
withold their products/services from me until I cough up the money
<br>
than it is for me to circumvent their security measures. This would be
<br>
true even if there were no courts and no police. It's a basic
<br>
principle that extends to animal territoriality and the core from
<br>
which systems of law have emerged. Until recently, it's also been
<br>
easier to withold information than it was to pirate it. That is no
<br>
longer the case. The only point at which you exercise control over
<br>
information is at the point where you decide whether or not to release
<br>
it to your first customer. With considerable surveillance and
<br>
coercion, you can probably force your immediate customers to keep the
<br>
information to themselves. However, each additional customer you have
<br>
multiplies the risk that somebody will defect, and each customer that
<br>
defects generates an unlimited number of additional 'customers' who
<br>
are completely beyond your control. Very quickly, the magnitude of
<br>
coercion and surveillance required to keep you in business reaches
<br>
levels possible only for governments, and even for them at
<br>
considerable expense. Pardon that huge preamble. My question is simply
<br>
this: is an industry that would otherwise collapse entitled to use the
<br>
government as a crutch indefinitely? Is overall wealth and progress
<br>
maximized by such practices?
<br>
<p>3. Supposing the public is willing to accept an abridgement of privacy
<br>
and free speech, given the increasing availability and sophistication
<br>
of cryptographic software, will such an abridgement even be
<br>
technically possible?
<br>
<p>PS: I notice in your essay on why Napster can't relocate to Sealand,
<br>
you overlooked another option. The protocols used by Napster are known
<br>
and there is no reason why an anonymous party can't simply release a
<br>
reverse-engineered, open source version of Napster, allowing hundreds
<br>
of independent, non-profit, and possibly anonymously owned servers to
<br>
spring up all over the world overnight? Furthermore, if I was running
<br>
the company, the temptation would be strong to release all my source
<br>
code as a parting shot to those who drove me out of business. Finally,
<br>
what is to prevent something completely decentralized like Gnutella,
<br>
(gnutella.wego.com) from driving the final nails into the intellectual
<br>
property coffin?
