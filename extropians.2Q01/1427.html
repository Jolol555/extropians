<p>
I was watching a CNN report, on an issue that has been brewing since last 
<br>
year, when an org funded by Gates of Microsoft, and Larry Elison of Oracle 
<br>
had a 'study' that postulated something like 1.5 million IT jobs would be 
<br>
created in the USA in something like 5 years. Then this org proceeded to hit 
<br>
Congress, with the need for permitting much, more 1H-B applicants. This 
<br>
category of applicants are non USA people, supposedly needed to keep the 
<br>
American technological workhorse from floundering, due to lack of enough 
<br>
Americans trained in IT.  
<br>
<p>My own nasty suspicion, is that this unbelievable, demand, for computer 
<br>
geeks, described in the 'report' may merely be a fig leaf to use foreign, IT 
<br>
guys and gals to drive down the pay rates of US proggies. My anger (if it is 
<br>
justified) is not at all targeted toward these foreign workers; but toward 
<br>
their paymasters of silicon valley, and their buds in corporate USA. 
<br>
<p>Most of you are of  Libertarian in temperament, if not in actual voting 
<br>
pattern. Is it reasonable to be concerned that our economic living standards 
<br>
may be driven down by what might be a scam? Is there any independent, 
<br>
corroborating, economic studies, that would indicate that we are indeed, in 
<br>
such dire, lack of trained North Americans, that we need to import; lest the 
<br>
wheel of intellectual commerce poop-out? If the captains of industry are 
<br>
putting such a grand inaccuracy, won't a declining standard of living for USA 
<br>
IT workers eventually, puncture their profit margins??
<br>
<p>I know I come off looking like a nativist, troglodyte (especially if I am), 
<br>
however I am willing to be corrected.
<br>
