<p>You said, &quot;this implies that an arbitrary collection of atoms,
<br>
organized in a sufficiently complex way that contains all of
<br>
the lookup 'states' a 'living' being will go through in the
<br>
time they are alive *is* conscious.&quot;  Are you now saying that
<br>
it's only conscious if you can verify that it's conscious?  If
<br>
not, why does the represented being care how the atoms are
<br>
arranged or even if there are atoms?  Or, to take it step by
<br>
step, can I spread the atoms apart?  By light years?  There's
<br>
no communication happening between them so does it even matter
<br>
what order I put them in?  And if that's the case, isn't it
<br>
enough that there *are* atoms?  Do I have to create a
<br>
representation *at all*?  (Let's take an example of a non-
<br>
static system: If I pull your brain apart, separating each
<br>
neuron by arbitrary great distances and not arranging them in
<br>
any particular order and, as luck would have it, they all
<br>
happen to fire in *exactly* the same way they would have had I
<br>
not committed this heinous act, would you experience
<br>
consciousness?  If not, why not?  What if we use non-specific
<br>
neurons?  What if we use something other than neurons?  What
<br>
if we operate at a lower-level than neurons?  Isn't it enough
<br>
that there *are* neurons, or atoms, or matter, or whatever?)
<br>
And if you are saying that it's only conscious if you can
<br>
verify that it's conscious, why is that?  What if I include in
<br>
its representation memories of your having affirmed it's
<br>
status as a conscious being, will it be conscious then?
