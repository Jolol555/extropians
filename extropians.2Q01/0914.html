<em>&gt; &gt; The result of this chain of reasoning is that the distinction between

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as physical ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would agree they are real in the sense that their thoughts do occur and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something has to happen in the &quot;real&quot; (basement) world for that to happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would also assert that they are of less *value* in a simulated world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than in the &quot;real&quot; world because they are inherently less efficient.
</em><br>
<p><p>Is &quot;efficiency&quot; a valid model of the *value* of an intelligent
<br>
self-aware being?  I find that a bit difficult to concede.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, but they are not &quot;real&quot; in the sense that their existence is purposeless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our universe, if it is the &quot;real&quot; universe, does not exist for any reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It simply &quot;is&quot; (as far as I can tell).  Sim-ed universes exist for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason be it scientific exploration, a need for entertainment, or a desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for company, etc.  If the creator of those universes exhausts their usefullness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe they have every right to fold them up and reallocate the resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to something else.
</em><br>
<p>Once you have turned the corner and created self-aware intelligent
<br>
beings I don't think you can morally any longer claim they exist only
<br>
for your own purposes.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have &quot;moral&quot; examples of these tradeoffs in human culture.  A mother with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two infants who does not have sufficient food resources to feed both is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified in sacrficing one to minimize the suffering it would experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in starving and to promote the survival of the other infant.  A physician
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a war situation faced with patients who will and will not make it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified in dedicating his efforts to those who will.
</em><br>
<p>A justification from scarce resources is only valid in a truly scarce
<br>
resource situation that there is no other way to deal with.  I get the
<br>
impression from your general tone above does not speak of the simulated
<br>
real beings as, as it were, beloved children you would be loathe to
<br>
sacrifice if you had to but rather as if they are simply your property
<br>
and entertainment to do with as you will.  I think there is quite a
<br>
difference.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of us, each and every day make conscious decisions to allocate our resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the benefit of ourselves and the benefit of those close to us.  Yet we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *know* that there are real, living, breathing, conscious people whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realities could be greatly assisted, perhaps even preventing their deaths,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by our reallocating those resources for their use.  But we choose not to do that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So either we are all immoral or eliminating conscious beings by commission or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omission is justifiable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Elimiating them because you think them your property or such is
<br>
something else entirely.  Merely electing to take care of yourself and
<br>
your direct dependents and friends and so on rather than others you know
<br>
less well is not a large moral problem in a world where there is
<br>
sufficient scarcity that one has no choice.  But that is not quite the
<br>
same thing it seems to me as described above.
