New to me, at least explaned in that way by a cosmologist, rather then
<br>
merely, a SciFi writer.  Or, let us say a cosmologist who is willing to
<br>
explore implications of what they research.
<br>

<br>
<p>Yes, Smolin has the ability to articulate vague ancient cosmology with cutting
<br>
edge physics in an admirable way. Thanks for the reference to Edge (btw, Edge
<br>
83 is April, not March) Good read!
<br>
<p>Some Smolinisms:
<br>
<p>&quot;At worst life will be able to survive by coding itself into the quantum
<br>
geometry of space itself.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;This raises a question: could there be a theory so complicated that its space
<br>
of configurations is not constructible through any finite procedure? For
<br>
example, is it possible that the topology of an infinite dimensional
<br>
configuration space were not finitely specifiable? And were this the case,
<br>
what would be the implications for how we understand dynamics.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Lee Smolin gave the longest and most substantial response. He describes a
<br>
third possible form of information processing which is neither analog (because
<br>
it is based on discrete rather than continuous components) nor digital
<br>
(because it cannot be simulated by a digital computer algorithm). His
<br>
information storage is based on the topological structure of finite graphs in
<br>
three-dimensional space. This illustrates the general statement that the
<br>
categories of analog and digital are too narrow to cover the range of possible
<br>
machines and organisms. It is possible that Smolin's topological information
<br>
processing may actually exist, both in living cells and in the fine-structure
<br>
of space-time.&quot;

<p>Useless hypotheses:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
