</em><br>
<p>I realized after reading Natasha and Anders' responses that my
<br>
ERA proposal was heading in the wrong direction.  Its value as
<br>
a tool would be severely limited if we base it upon a chess-like
<br>
Elo rating.  The purpose of an Elo rating is to match up opponents
<br>
in a tournament, for it is no fun for either player if one stomps
<br>
the other like a cockroach.
<br>
<p>What we are looking for is a tool that rates posts.  We tend
<br>
to jump to rating authors, for that is exactly how we choose
<br>
books, art and music.  But there may be a better way to create
<br>
filters for chat groups.  The first thing that comes to mind is
<br>
the perennial topic of subject line discipline.  Brian pointed
<br>
out the subject lines from 3 yrs ago vs now, but note that
<br>
two of the subject lines which contained my name, along
<br>
with &quot;head throb&quot; and &quot;body&quot; were actually about caloric
<br>
restriction {along with plenty of silliness, I admit}.  So part
<br>
of the problem there is subject line discipline.  Robert
<br>
Bradbury will perhaps offer some guidance on that.
<br>
<p>A forum such as this one would benefit greatly from having
<br>
some sort of feedback mechanism.  When one is cutting up
<br>
at a party, one looks around to see if the others are enjoying
<br>
themselves and egging one on, or alternately if people are
<br>
squirmy, one knows to cut it out.  On a chat group, that kind
<br>
of feedback is mostly absent.  What we need instead of a
<br>
ERA (which would devolve into a mere beauty contest) is
<br>
a table somewhere in which anonymous volunteers could rate
<br>
individual  posts with a simple number between 0 and 5 for
<br>
their extropy value.  A running average could be calculated.
<br>
Then the time challenged could download only the
<br>
4 and 5 star posts.  spike
