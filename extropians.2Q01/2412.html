<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Ok... that's like saying &quot;Let them buy thier crack, eventually, they'll die

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't know if I'd go quite that far, but perhaps you've come up with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of solution (reminescent of the &quot;7% solution&quot;). This policy would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably do well in US prisons, where more than half of inmates have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convicted of drug offenses. Naturally this approach would only involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Victimless crimes should not result in prison sentences.  A lot of
<br>
people are in prison on pot charges.  That is a major travesty.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;  It strikes me as a rather socially irresponsible view.  They *dont* die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off.  Drug addicts today, and simsense addicts tommrow, always have a stead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppply of new converts, and the rest of society suffers for it.  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not as much as it suffers from the so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot;.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Probably one of the most destructive and anti-social memes (are memes real, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just another useless hypothesis?) going around these days is the accusation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social irresponsibility. If your're sincerely concerned about social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility, then you should support responsible policy vis a vis the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so-called &quot;war on drugs&quot; which would mean ending it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hear, Hear.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, you started off with &quot;Abuse of future neuroscience applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies&quot; and now you're confuting that with illegal drug use. Do you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ulterior agenda here... one which would place applied neuroscience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies in the same category with illicit drugs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If I spent all my time in the future jacked in working on very
<br>
sophisticated problems and tend to forget about physical reality matters
<br>
unless reminded, am I then an addict or simply engrossed in my work?  
<br>
<p>If someone else is building and exploring elaborate fantasies and is
<br>
similarly engrossed are they addicts and perhaps to be judged
<br>
&quot;criminal&quot;?  To whom?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;  Further I happen to believe that people have intrinsic value in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.  Letting them deal with the consequences of thier actions is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, but letting them die because they made a few foolish choices is pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damn jaded.  What, you don't believe in social support nets, and catching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somebody when they stumble and fall, rather than just letting them smash thier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head on the sidewalk? &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It depends on what you mean.  It is not my responsibility to protect
<br>
every person on the planet from the consequences of their actions. 
<br>
Although admittedly I often dream of playing Technological Boddhisattva
<br>
and secretly uploading or backing them all up so that ultimately, if
<br>
they so choose, there always is another chance to  grow and succeed.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So we need to institute social support nets for people who are addicted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games? And who provides social support nets for the bureaucrats who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addicted to the game of providing social support nets? No thanks. The position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Extropy Institute and other groups dedicated to improving life by expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology seems more responsible to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe technology alone is sufficient.  With a large-scale
<br>
enrolling vision or set of visions and a very solid rationally grounded
<br>
ethics I suspect the technology will only result in all our strengths
<br>
and flaws becoming so magnified that the change of humanity surviving is
<br>
much too small.
