I recently bought X-Plane (K-Mart for $39.95), which comes pre-loaded
<br>
with dozens of different aircraft, as well as &quot;Plane Maker&quot; and &quot;Part
<br>
Maker&quot; with which the individual can design their own aircraft, apply
<br>
their custom 'skins' to the aircraft of their choice, and alter
<br>
pre-existing aircraft (wings, engines, control panels, control surfaces,
<br>
loadings, wing sections, etc...).
<br>
<p>Get this: You can fly the space shuttle through an orbital re-entry to
<br>
land at the airport of choice with this simulator. You can also download
<br>
a Dyna-Soar sim-pack from www.deepcold.com to fly the Dyna-Soar on an
<br>
airdrop from a B-52.
<br>
<p>X-Plane does a very good job of calculating the aerodynamics of the
<br>
aircraft it simulates. I just need to figure out how to import DXF files
<br>
into it, as its 3D modeling engine in &quot;Plane Maker&quot; is rather simple
<br>
compared to others.
<br>
<p>You can design planes with up to two vertical stabs, three wings, and
<br>
you can do piston, turbo-prop, turbine, and rocket propulsion.
