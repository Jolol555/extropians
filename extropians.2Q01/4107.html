<em>&gt; Perhaps, Eliezer, you have not yet fully outgrown your religious roots ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What on Earth is that comment supposed to be about?
<br>
<p>I would offer the following test for whether you are an Iconoclast of the
<br>
Better Way:
<br>
<p>1)  Do you vote for the same political party your parents did?  Are you
<br>
aware that 95% of the variance in political preferences is accounted for
<br>
by reference to parental preferences?  Isn't that pathetic?
<br>
<p>2)  Do you have the same religion you were brought up in?  They can't all
<br>
be right, can they?  Would that strategy really work if everyone used it?
<br>
<p>3)  WHY THE HELL AREN'T YOU USING A DVORAK KEYBOARD?  Did you even TRY
<br>
it?  Just once in your life?  Doesn't continuing to use Qwerty indicate
<br>
that sheer mental inertia is just about the only driving factor in your
<br>
life?
<br>
<p>Never trust anyone who doesn't use a Dvorak keyboard, that's my motto. 
<br>
Whether you use Dvorak is the simple, clear-cut, acid test of whether you
<br>
converge to true thoughts and the best ways or whether you're just
<br>
staggering through life with a head full of nonsense.
<br>
<p>(And yes, I know that Dvorak exaggerated his original results and that
<br>
someone went back and debunked them.  But just because the original claims
<br>
were inflated doesn't mean that a home row of &quot;asdf jkl;&quot; is superior to
<br>
&quot;aoeu htns&quot;.  I've actually used both keyboards, and I'm here to tell you
<br>
that Qwerty sucks.  All you need to do is type &quot;the&quot; on a Dvorak keyboard
<br>
and you will never, ever go back.)
