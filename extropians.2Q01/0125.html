Interesting, but I gotta say, manned exploration is the ticket. When 
<br>
people ask me why, I say: If you gotta ask why, there's really no 
<br>
explaining it to you.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;:)
<br>
<p>Robotic stuff is great, but limited and far less likely to draw 
<br>
widespread support. As I posted a few days back, NASA is going to 
<br>
&quot;defer&quot; new tech development indefinitely owing to budget cuts.
<br>
<p>Private industry must see concrete profitable motivations for this 
<br>
stuff. NASA never needed that, and shouldn't--though they're now 
<br>
forming some very interesting partnerships and spreading their 
<br>
activities over many more states (this latter presumably for greater 
<br>
political support). NASA says every $1 into the program generates 
<br>
$14, however.
<br>
<p>As to industry developing an independent space infrastructure--the 
<br>
cost is staggering. The United States ill afford to duplicate the 
<br>
NASA infrastructure today.
<br>
<p>There is a wildcard I don't believe you've considered: James Cameron. 
<br>
He's moving forward on several space projects which are bound to have 
<br>
an impact on public perceptions. I actually spoke with him briefly on 
<br>
this, and plan to publish his comments. He wants us on Mars. I 
<br>
believe it possible his projects could reinvigorate the manned space 
<br>
program. A long shot? Perhaps. But I'm rooting for him.
<br>
<p>Never underestimate the power of the media.

<p><em>&gt; I read the news of the Bush budget axe falling so heavily on NASA with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling of sadness, but also of resignation.  The simple fact is that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national space programs of the Cold War period simply can't persist in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemporary world, and that broad social support for &quot;pure&quot; space science 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't strong enough to sustain a large space exploration effort.  Even the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional support for the sheer adventure of manned space activities has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely evaporated outside of the &quot;space enthusiast&quot; community.  As Michael 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Butler pointed out, attempts to make a go of access to space outside of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional national space programs that seemed to have so much promise just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few years ago have all proved quixotic in the extreme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've come to the conclusion that the sooner the different elements of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space exploration and development community come to the realization that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;old game&quot; is over, the better.  A LOT of energy has been wasted on trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvage elements of the Cold War space programs and develop incremental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary pathways that build on what is left of them.  In this regard, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel that ideas like Robert Zubrin's are exactly the wrong kind of program to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be proposing at this time.  Trying to hitch one's wagon to the current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery of space access and infrastructure -- such as it is -- is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prescription for wasted time, effort and money, because any such plans will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitably be built on the requirement of continuing political support for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NASA.  NASA's mandate is, in my opinion, irretrievably confused by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political process, having been since the end of the Cold War a hodge-podge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalization based on whatever opportunity of the moment its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administrators can conjure out of the political swamp in Washington.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather than wasting energy by trying to revive the now decaying remains of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original national space programs, I feel a much more fruitful approach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be to begin work on designing and planning for a program of space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploration and development premised on technologies we ought to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available for that enterprise within the next ten years.  There are certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeds of such an approach scattered throughout the space science and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology communities. People working on micro-sats and fleet architectures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them are definitely on the right track.  The approach being taken for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their solar sail platform by the Planetary Society is also very promising.    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's missing is a unifying vision for creating a space infrastructure that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't so completely dependent on NASA and doesn't require the unreliable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support of a political world that has no appreciation for the enterprise of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving beyond this one planet.  In this regard, designing and building some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic building blocks for creating space infrastructure out of very small and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light elements should be a high priority, as well as developing reliable and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robust self-assembling systems.
