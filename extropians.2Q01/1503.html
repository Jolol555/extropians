</em><br>
<p>Well, one of the unusually hard-edged aspects of the future history imagined by
<br>
&quot;species bigot&quot; Olaf Stapledon is that,...
<br>
<p>SPOILER ALERT for _Last and First Men_ (which I've probably already spoiled :-/ )
<br>
<p>...when the immense span of time encompassed by _Last and First Men_ was
<br>
subsumed into the even more immense span of _Star Maker_, the careers of
<br>
the eighteen intelligent races of our solar system turned out to be a blind alley,
<br>
a mere footnote in the cosmic history summarized in _Star Maker_, not part of the
<br>
mainstream of intelligent life that finally achieved cosmic transcendence.
<br>
<p>And further,
<br>
<p>SPOILER ALERT for _Star Maker_
<br>
<p>the awakened cosmos at the end of _Star Maker_ itself turns out to be
<br>
a blind alley, a mere prototype to be contemplated in completion for
<br>
an instant by the Creator before being smashed on the heap of the
<br>
potsherds of earlier universes.
<br>
<p>Stapledon's &quot;Extropianism&quot; was of a different sort than that of most of
<br>
the folks on this list.  **We're** all looking for a quick fix -- Transcendence
<br>
**now** (or by 2010, or 2050, or whenever -- if you're not going to make
<br>
it alive, just make sure your head gets frozen!).
<br>
<p>Stapledon's view (as articulated by the Eighteenth Man in _Last and First Men_,
<br>
the human narrator who is vouchsafed a vision of the future in _Star Maker_,
<br>
and by the intelligence-boosted dog and &quot;wide-awake&quot; trans-human of _Sirius_ and
<br>
_Odd John_, respectively) was that we ought to **act** like champions
<br>
of intelligence and enlightenment, even if there's absolutely no chance of
<br>
there being anything in it for **us** (personally, or for our planet, or even
<br>
for our universe!).
<br>
<p>It's a very grim sort of optimism, and it's also, oddly enough, one of the
<br>
darkly inspiring elements of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien:
<br>
<p>&quot;... a major goal of _The Lord of the Rings_ was to dramatise that 'theory
<br>
of courage' which Tolkien had said in his British Academy lecture was
<br>
the 'great contribution' to humanity of the old literature of the North.
<br>
The central pillar of that theory was Ragnarok -- the day when gods
<br>
and men would fight evil and the giants, and inevitably be defeated.
<br>
Its great statement was that defeat is no refutation.  The right side
<br>
remains the right side even if it has no ultimate hope at all.  In a
<br>
sense this Northern mythology asks more of men, even makes more of them,
<br>
than does Christianity, for it offers them no heaven, no salvation,
<br>
no reward for virtue except the sombre satisfaction of having done what
<br>
is right.  Tolkien wanted his characters in _The Lord of the Rings_ to
<br>
live up to the same high standard.  He was careful therefore to remove
<br>
easy hope from them, even to make them conscious of long-term defeat
<br>
and doom.&quot;
<br>
<p>-- _The Road to Middle-earth_, T. A. Shippey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 5, &quot;Interlacements and the Ring&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;section &quot;Apparent paradoxes: happy sadness and hopeless cheer&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(pp. 117-118)
