Well, it depends on how much you master the subject, but also
<br>
on whom you're explaining it to and his own mastery of the subject.

<p><em>&gt; Isn't it true, for example, that some things are a lot harder to explain

Well, a geometry problem might be difficult to explain, if you don't
<br>
resort to a protocol that will help the other person draw the correct figure.
<br>
It's first a matter of having an expressive enough common protocol;
<br>
afterwards, it's a bandwidth problem that will determine communication speed.
<br>
Oh, and of course there's a prior information problem to determine if there
<br>
is enough information to transmit, and/or enough distributed information
<br>
for the new information to emerge out of the communication.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, some things are hard to explain, period.

Reminds me of that Bastiat quote:
<br>
<p>What a lot of trouble to prove in political economy that two and two make four;
<br>
and if you succeed in doing so, people cry, 'It is so clear that it is boring.'
<br>
Then they vote as if you had never proved anything at all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Frederic Bastiat, &quot;What Is Seen and What is Not Seen&quot;, 1850
<br>
<p>In that case, the problem lies in the rational ignorance of voters,
<br>
whence stems their ignorance of political economy.
