Max More refreshed the signal with,
<br>
<em>&gt; The current issue of MIT's Technology Review has a substantial article on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microturbines and fuel cells. You may be interested even if you don't live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in California.
</em><br>
<p>Living in Northern California, I really appreciate this news. (Only the True
<br>
Death is worse than losing power while on the Other Plane.)
<br>
Peter Fairley writes, &quot;These &quot;micropower generators&quot; aren't just about
<br>
emergency backup, either. They can provide higher quality power 24/7 than you
<br>
can buy from your local utility. Plug into one of these systems and you'll
<br>
avoid the computer-crashing voltage spikes and sags that mar the electricity
<br>
coming out of a garden-variety wall socket. And micropower means you can
<br>
forsake the grid when power prices surge, or even make an extra buck by
<br>
exporting power to your neighbors. Spread enough micropower throughout the
<br>
grid, and the grid itself will begin to learn tricks that could make
<br>
regionwide power outages an unpleasant memory.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's the (potentially) good news. The (same old) bad news is that although
<br>
we may like the idea of &quot;Power To The People&quot; the DemocRATs don't.
<br>
Representative Richard A. Gephart and his socialist pals want to cap energy
<br>
prices, thereby decreasing or removing incentive to develop alternative
<br>
sources of electricity. Thankfully, socialists are in the minority on this
<br>
issue. If people can achieve energy self-sufficiency, they can jettison an
<br>
entire layer of tax subsidized bureaucRAT control. No wonder they sound
<br>
worried.
<br>
<p>Power To The People!
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>PS: The turbines and fuel cells are nice, but they require fuels that I can't
<br>
produce myself.
<br>
For true autonomy, how 'bout a wood-burning generator or a laptop that runs on
<br>
leaf litter...
<br>
like the gastrobot we've heard about.

<br>
Gastronome is powered by a microbial fuel cell filled with E. coli bacteria.
<br>
So far it only ingests sugar; as the bacteria break down glucose molecules,
<br>
electrons are released and captured to charge a battery
