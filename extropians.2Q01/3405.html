Anders Sandberg enriched the signal with,
<br>
<em>&gt; How to manage such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperations, that remains to be invented - this is an area where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist creativity can participate and produce immediate dividends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides, we can use dealing with cyber-attacks as a training for dealing
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; nano-attacks.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we probably wouldn't want that kind of cooperation to start here,
<br>
because this is an open forum, and who knows how many Chinese cyber-attackers
<br>
are listening. ô¿ô
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One China: I don't know the official Swedish policy, but the general opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be that Taiwan is better off not part of the PRC. Here the &gt;H angle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is of course how to deal with abusive nation states and maybe how to play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them against each other to increase individual freedom.
</em><br>
<p>I really like the idea of playing them against each other to increase
<br>
individual freedom. We need to take care not to play them too hard against
<br>
each other, because individual freedom isn't much good in a scorched earth
<br>
scenario in which the opponents have resorted to mutually assured destruction
<br>
to keep from losing. I mean, it's important not to let cyber-war escalate to
<br>
nuclear, biological, chemical warfare. Here's where NIMBY makes real good
<br>
sense. Of course it only makes sense to play abusive nation states against
<br>
each other if you don't have to live in one of them. So, how's the real estate
<br>
business in Stockholm? ô¿ô
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Russian artificial brain: no, it all sounds like a news hoax. There is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steady stream of inflated claims coming from Russia (from elsewhere too, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact-checking is especially limited when it comes to Russia), and the news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story you refer to did not appear to contain anything new. &gt;H moral:
</em><br>
critical
<br>
<em>&gt; analysis of news is quite essential to avoid spending too much time on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spurious claims.
</em><br>
<p>Quite so, and in addition they might think the same about stories regarding
<br>
the S*ng*l*r*ty. Come to think of it, maybe they concocted the brain story to
<br>
counter what they consider bogus claims from (self-styled) transhumanists.
<br>
Anyway, near-term stuff includes Extro-5, right? Whoops! There I go again...
<br>
the theme of E5 is... that nasty topic again.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I don't see any presenters/speakers addressing the subject of
<br>
triggering the Net to transcend. How silly is the idea of the Net awakening
<br>
and thinking for itself?
<br>
<p>&quot;The web knows. It knows everything. The web is god.&quot;
<br>
--Spike
<br>
<p>ô¿ô
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
