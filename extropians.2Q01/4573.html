<p><em>&gt; Mitch, Hal, and Eugene keep coming dangerously close to a full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion of SF level time travel, paradoxes and all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there anyone on this list who has not at some time or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally tried to work out a theory of time travel that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would resolve, or escape from, the paradoxes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One idea I had turns out (so I like to think) isomorphic to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what David Deutsch suggests!  First, DD wrote an article in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientific American five or six years back that purported to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe how time travel would really work.  You can't imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my anticipation of reading that, only to be rather disappointed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seemed that DD was saying that --- well, you know how anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can happen in the multiverse?  E.g., your keyboard could suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn into a brown rabbit, because there is a small amplitude in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; QM for just such a transformation? --- he was saying, or so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to to me, that the appearance of a time traveler from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future was exactly such a miraculous transformation.  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dull.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I always have to read Deutsch twice to appreciate him.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; he devotes an entire chapter to time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel!  And he's right on the money (as we Americans say),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely fleshing out his earlier SA article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But here was my idea from many years ago:  suppose (to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the paradox simpler) we have a Contrarian.  This person will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always say &quot;Yes&quot; if he is supposed to say &quot;No&quot; and vice-verse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Contrarian receives information from the future that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about to say &quot;Yes&quot;, so naturally he says &quot;No&quot;.  Well, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after he writes down his answer somewhere, and some time travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparatus gets hold of it, it's now the &quot;No&quot; answer that flies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backwards in time.  This time, the past Contrarian is presented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the &quot;He said No&quot; information, and so says &quot;Yes&quot;.  Then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later, when **his** information is written down and then used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the time travel apparatus, the cycle repeats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you have already probably guessed, this picture involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sort of meta-time.  (You should properly have gagged at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of the &quot;this time's&quot; and &quot;later's&quot; that I used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that paragraph.)  Now then, we mark the &quot;nth&quot; instance of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information going backwards in time, and then the &quot;n+1th&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance and so on, where n and n+1 are elements of a non-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-ordered set (so that there is no starting element).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it gives rise to an ensemble-type picture:  you look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at these two paths and see them both happening infinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many times, but identically each time, which really amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them just happening once each (under a certain interpretation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The more elaborate paradoxes are handled similarly.  You kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your grandfather, and then aren't born in the next &quot;run&quot;, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then history is different, someone else gets the time machine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then kills his grandfather (or sends the 1937 Electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Engineering Handbook back to 1837), and a different history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens, and then a different history happens, and then...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some large but finite number of times, until you are born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once more, and the entire cycle repeats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But so far as I can make out, this is what David Deutsch is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in effect saying.  If you &quot;go back in time&quot; you are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a different branch of the multiverse, that's all.  (The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse is a continuum, so it would lack my finite recursion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property that I used for illustration above, but that isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eugene wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...you've got a loop of Final Cause (the Antipode of the First
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cause) keeping reaching back, and restructuring the timeline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iteratively.  Not only is this bootstrap, this is autofeedback.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The capabilities are nudged backwards with each increment. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initial kinetics dynamics is limited, but I have no idea how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limited.  Even if you're getting back &quot;only&quot; information, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might be very surprised what you might be getting back from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scant few hours into the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not completely clear to me what he's saying, but the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get out of this is as follows.  Suppose that you are climbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hill at a certain angle theta.  Then information from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future arrives which enables you to climb at theta+iota.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then since you are now on *that* slope, so to speak, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be receiving information from a more advanced future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The effect of that information will be to now place you on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theta+iota+iota slope, and so on, as long as you keep your machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receiving from the tangential future.  (The tangent space, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who know differential geometry, is a good metaphor here.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the metaverse, this would have the following implication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligent life (i.e. life that is capable of devising and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profiting from the use of time travel devices) almost always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes off on an indescribable tangent (to badly mix metaphors).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, a Singularity is achieved in a way that we have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so far discussed very much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, so much for paradoxes: they can be dealt with in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner that I have suggested, namely by an appeal to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse which (I think!) is indistinguishable from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-time idea above.  (My reference to the 1937 Electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Handbook is taken from the marvelous old time travel short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story &quot;Other Tracks&quot;, which has inspired almost all my time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel ideas.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee Corbin
</em><br>
<p>I think if you consider all the possible events that might occur, then
<br>
there are graphs of the probabilities and their realities.  For example,
<br>
consider sports betting where each week all the teams except for a
<br>
couple play.  For each of those games for each week, then, there are
<br>
simple charts of points scored and games won, although it is less
<br>
significant who had any given number of points or some other statistic,
<br>
because at the end of a season, each of those teams would have a
<br>
win-loss record.
<br>
<p>If you could rewind time to the start of the season, considering some
<br>
regular league, then with the schedules already set the teams would play
<br>
as they did in the first sampling of the season, where it could be
<br>
expected to see very similar results for this repeated season, because
<br>
the initial conditions are the same except for you having found some way
<br>
to rewind time.  The more dedicated are all of the players, the more
<br>
likely it is to see similar results.
<br>
<p>Thus, at the end of this second sampled season, the graph or chart of
<br>
outcomes of the events would likely be very similar.  Then there are
<br>
questions about what happened to the first season, and the third,
<br>
fourth, etc.  Here what this leads to is probabilistic representations
<br>
of the conditions at the points where time travel took place.
<br>
<p>So the multiverse is one way to examine the concept, yet it might also
<br>
be the closed loops system, where any change in time resonates back to
<br>
real time.  It could be a hybrid system, where insignificant events only
<br>
minisculely change the probabilistic state and caught and pulled by the
<br>
current of that local spacetime back into the primary or main line of
<br>
time, where significant events to the spacetime might have enough weight
<br>
to fall into the next current of spacetime.
<br>
<p>This is reminiscent of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, where the premise is that the
<br>
protagonist repeats a day over and over again, consciously, where no
<br>
scientific explanation is offered.  The protagonist uses this long time
<br>
to become skilled in many things, and knowledgeable of the initial
<br>
conditions of that day which keeps repeating, where he eventually
<br>
escapes with a happy ending, having gained character.
<br>
<p>In analysis, with Minkowskian or super-Euclidean spacetime, where
<br>
Euclidean space is a state of what we see as 3-D, a snapshot, the
<br>
non-Euclidean space is measured by what are called time-like or
<br>
light-like vectors, where the light measure vectors are zeroed and the
<br>
time-like vectors imaginary with respect to Euclidean space, and one
<br>
axis of the time dimensions, for us as observers, plods ever from time
<br>
negative infinity to time infinity, with it always being zero.
<br>
<p>About paradoxes, I think there are none.
