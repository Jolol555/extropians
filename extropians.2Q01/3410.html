</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, we probably wouldn't want that kind of cooperation to start here,

</em><br>
<p>Actually, the only defense that can ever work is a defense that works even 
<br>
when the enemy knows how it works. Security through obscurity is not safe. Do 
<br>
you really think that it would be possible or desirable to keep the 
<br>
functioning of an organisation that would likely involve thousands of 
<br>
different groups secret? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course it only makes sense to play abusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation states against each other if you don't have to live in one of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, how's the real estate business in Stockholm? ô¿ô
</em><br>
<p>I thought you wanted to *avoid* abusive states? :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Incidentally, I don't see any presenters/speakers addressing the subject of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It is a bit of wishful thinking: if we create something complex enough it 
<br>
will become intelligent. There is not a shred of evidence for that happening, 
<br>
since intelligent thought requires a rather sophisticated and deliberate 
<br>
organisation, so it is unlikely to occur by chance. On the other hand, as 
<br>
Spike alluded, the effect of billions of people writing, linking and 
<br>
modifying the Net does introduce an element of intelligence. So my answer 
<br>
would be that we should look more for something like the global intelligence 
<br>
of the EarthWeb in Marc Stiegler's novel rather than a god awakening to the 
<br>
sound of all phones ringing.
