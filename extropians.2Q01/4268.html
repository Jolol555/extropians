<em>&gt; Wow, so much for analysis and prognostication. Basically, the article

<br>
I'm afraid this is how I see most of our predictions.  After watching the
<br>
moon landings, I regularly saw predictions of Moon bases by 1980, Mars bases
<br>
by 1990, flying cars in the year 2000. AI such as HAL was predicted to be
<br>
this year, as well as a manned mission to Jupiter.  I really thought I would
<br>
live to visit other planets, but now that hope seems unlikely unless a major
<br>
breakthrough in life-extension allows me to go farther into the future.
<br>
<p>Predications such as these are routinely over-optimistic.  Although
<br>
technology is advancing at a phenomenal rate, most people underestimate the
<br>
inertia of most human's desires that things remain the same.  Our biggest
<br>
threat is not the inability of technology to progress, but the antagonism
<br>
most people feel toward technology.  Most people actively oppose all this
<br>
neat stuff we are talking about.
<br>
<p>Look at what happened to the space program once people decided that we
<br>
didn't want a space race anymore.  Expect the same apathy toward other
<br>
technologies.  How fast can progress occur in a capitalist system if nobody
<br>
wants it?
<br>
<p>Progress is not inevitable.  Progress is not popular.  Progress is not
<br>
likely.
<br>
We really are going to have an uphill battle to fight for the future.
