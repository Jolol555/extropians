This is going to be a mess.  Consider that clones are made today in fertility
<br>
labs.  I can envision the case in which a couple is using the services of a
<br>
fertility lab to do genetic selection because they have some kind of genetic
<br>
disorder that makes it too risky to use nature's way.  In this case several
<br>
embryos may be cloned and tested to come up with one set of clones to be
<br>
implanted.  Right to Life folks are not happy with this because some embryos
<br>
get terminated.  So far, not much problem, and I am sure new laws will not
<br>
stop this practice.
<br>
<p>Now let us suppose that the couple above ends up with a healthy child who
<br>
makes them very happy.  Unfortunately, the child dies by some terrible
<br>
accident.  Fortunately, the couple banked the other embryos, so they can try
<br>
again with the same genotype.  It seems to me, this may be the start of a
<br>
legal problem, but no jury is going to put the grieving couple away for
<br>
starting over, let alone take the kid away after having been shown the dead
<br>
baby pictures with the implied question &quot;What would you have done?&quot;
<br>
<p>Now let us take out the accident.  The couple likes the kid so much, they
<br>
want another.  Rather than going through the genetic selection again, they
<br>
decide to use a banked embryo to have the other twin.  However, we now have
<br>
the problem of technology making twins that are not of the same (living)
<br>
age.  Good lawyers would introduce the idea of the case above in the minds of
<br>
the jury, and put it to them that they would not have convicted had the first
<br>
child died, so how could they convict now?  Further, they could argue that
<br>
the frozen embryo should not be discriminated against just because an older
<br>
sibling has the same genotype; why should the existence of the older sibling
<br>
diminish the embryo's Right to Life?
<br>
<p>Next suppose that one of the twins above grows up and decides that he/she
<br>
wants a clone.  The key step is now a trip to the freezer, no egg hunt, no
<br>
nuclear transfer.  The Right to Life folks are going to want to see that
<br>
embryo have one.  If hauled into court, the adult twin could truthfully deny
<br>
having done the cloning, and argue the line that he/she had just rescued
<br>
his/her brother/sister from life threatening danger should the freezer fail.
<br>
If the ban on cloning people let this one slip through, they put themselves
<br>
in the position of saying that it is okay to have a bank of your clones made
<br>
before you were born, but not made later, although the result is going to be
<br>
the same.
<br>
<p>I predict that the product of ban on cloning laws is going to be waay too
<br>
much fun (and money) for lawyers.  I agree with Robert, just wait. I am.
