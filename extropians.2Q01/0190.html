<em>&gt;      There was a question about how Islam (about 25% of the planet's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population) would respond to the types of technology we are interested
</em><br>
in.
<br>
<p>If it's important to consider how Muslims respond to extropic technology,
<br>
then it's three times MORE important to question how non-Muslims (about
<br>
75% of the planet's population) would respond to extropic technology,
<br>
because there are three times more of them. Since this is the Extropy list
<br>
(not the Muslim theology list), it seems somewhat OT to discuss Islamic
<br>
responses and/or theology. But since no one has complained...
<br>
<p>Muslims, just like Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and any other
<br>
faith-based creeds, have a small percentage of true believers, and the
<br>
rest are content to identify themselves with their parents' denomination
<br>
and go about their business, not giving it much thought. As Max's recent
<br>
presentation at a Jewish school shows, normal, healthy kids don't let
<br>
religious memes interfere with their perception of reality at large. I
<br>
imagine that most of these kids are smart enough to ask questions like the
<br>
following.
<br>
<p>*     When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a
<br>
pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev.1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They
<br>
claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?
<br>
<p>*     I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in
<br>
Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price
<br>
for her?
<br>
<p>*     I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her
<br>
period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev.15:19-24). The problem is, how do I
<br>
tell? I have tried
<br>
asking, but most women take offence.
<br>
<p>*      Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and
<br>
female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of
<br>
mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you
<br>
clarify?  Why can't I own Canadians?
<br>
<p>*     I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2
<br>
clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill
<br>
him myself?
<br>
<p>* A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an
<br>
abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.
<br>
I don't agree.  Can you
<br>
settle this?
<br>
<p>* Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a
<br>
defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my
<br>
vision have to be 20/20, or is
<br>
there some room for negotiation here?
<br>
<p>* Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair
<br>
around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by
<br>
Lev.19:27. How should they die?
<br>
<p>* I know from Lev.11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me
<br>
unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?
<br>
<p>* My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different
<br>
crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two
<br>
different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse
<br>
and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble
<br>
of getting the whole town together to stone them? (Lev.24:10-16) Couldn't
<br>
we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with
<br>
people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)
<br>
<p><p>Stay hungry,
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
<br>
free will
