<p>Thats right, but you started your sentence with &quot;All I know is...&quot; and
<br>
listed two truths, but in fact these are not all you know.  I kinda tricked
<br>
<p>you, since I started with having you randomly pick two primes {non-2
<br>
both}, multiply them to generate C.  So you know that C is odd, as are
<br>
C+2 and C+4, etc, so the probability of prime approximation needs
<br>
to be adjusted accordingly.  {8-]
<br>
<p>Before I belabor this whole thing more than I already have on a list
<br>
that is not primarily about primes, let me just do this:  I wish to put
<br>
together a paper on this topic which I have been thinking about way
<br>
too much for the past year, regarding predicting the next record prime,
<br>
then posting it on a website.
<br>
<p>I wish to draw parallels between that concept and predicting the time of
<br>
the singularity, for oddly enough, both problems, predicting the
<br>
singularity
<br>
and predicting the next record prime, present similar paradoxes.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I dont expect I will have it ready by E5, because I
<br>
need to read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, plus study
<br>
Eliezer's latest work before then, otherwise I risk being left behind
<br>
in what promises to be the best discussions I will hear in this year.
