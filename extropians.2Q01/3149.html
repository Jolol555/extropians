re: &quot;think the first thing to do is to find your motivation, those values 
<br>
and goals that make you go out and do something&quot;
<br>
<p>This presumes you can find your motivation, sometimes people have been so 
<br>
conditioned to think about survival needs that they are blind to what their 
<br>
higher motivations are.
<br>
<p>They don't know what they want, what they like, or if they at least know 
<br>
what they do not like, they lack the creativity or resources to move ahead.
<br>
<p>I have dogedly pursued a few aspirations and invested much energy into them 
<br>
only to find that the reality of the goal is far different than the imagined 
<br>
(ex Seattle musician for example) now further down the road with nothing to 
<br>
show for it.
<br>
<p>My creative imagination continually aspires to great heights, but in 
<br>
understanding that much of what I could imagine will never be attainable, or 
<br>
only as such a cost that it is brutally prohibitive (strips the joy out of 
<br>
it) and benumbing.
<br>
<p>Sometimes I think my only true desire is to have an endless supply of 
<br>
stunningly attractive sex partners, travel anywhere at a whim, study the 
<br>
sciences ad hock with endless mentors to explain what I don't understand, 
<br>
actually reverse in biological age back to about 25, and be highly paid for 
<br>
all of this.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I should have been a professional student liberal arts major, so 
<br>
much for maslow's(sp?) pyramid eh?
<br>
<p>comments or suggestions welcome

<p>I think the first thing to do is to find your motivation, those values and
<br>
goals that make you go out and do something. If you have an idea of what you
<br>
want to do with your life or what kind of person you want to be, then the
<br>
rest is a solvable problem.
<br>
<p>What I once did was to list all the stuff I wanted to do, and see both what
<br>
it had in common - that ought to be a top priority - and what I would need 
<br>
to
<br>
achieve it. For example, since I wanted to design a starship (I was rather
<br>
young when I did this) I realized I needed to know math do it. So learning
<br>
math was important, and I began to read some books on it in the library. The
<br>
same for a lot of other areas, including of course how to get better at
<br>
learning.
<br>
<p>Once you have motivation and a base to build from, you can really get 
<br>
started
<br>
with the fun stuff. You will need to develop your critical thinking so that
<br>
you can use your brainpower for constructive things, you will refine your
<br>
motivation and ideas and gradually develop your life into a creative 
<br>
artwork.
