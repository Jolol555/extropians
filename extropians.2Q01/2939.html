Hi Ben,
<br>
<p>I wanted to say a few things... First I am profoundly impressed with your
<br>
work, and would love to talk to you more about your engine. I've been
<br>
thinking about the cognitive layers/components/structures of a sentient mind
<br>
for a long time and I'd love to compare notes with you...
<br>
<p>That said, I did something... I just shot a letter off to the CEO of my
<br>
company. I work currently for Interwoven. The company is the premiere
<br>
Web Content Management software available on the market today, and
<br>
I think your search engine would be an absolutely amazing addition to the
<br>
suite of products growing in our stable.
<br>
<p>If all goes well, you may receive contact from Martin Braun (our CEO)
<br>
over the next few days, and with any luck, something sweet may come of
<br>
the interaction. I'm crossing my fingers, I want your work to procede, and
<br>
if this doesn't do it, I want to be there when you pick up the pieces and
<br>
start
<br>
again. I don't know what role I can take in supporting this, but I'll do what-
<br>
<p>ever is needed to support this. Your work is too important.
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I've been spending the last few years, not thinking about social

</em><br>
