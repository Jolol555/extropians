This is very helpful as it helps isolate the source of disagreement. That
<br>
mathematics might be full of sound and fury but signifying nothing is of
<br>
course not particularly comforting. Someone like Goedel, who thought we had
<br>
special intuitionistic access to the logical/mathematical structure of the
<br>
universe, I am sure is rolling over in his grave at your suggestion that
<br>
this might be the case.

The

since

In response let me quote from the great fideist Descartes, (who often goes
<br>
around in rationalistic drag):
<br>
<p>&quot;I would dare not even dare to say that God cannot arrange that a mountain
<br>
should exist without a valley, or that one and two should not make three;
<br>
but I only say that He has given me a mind of such a nature that I cannot
<br>
conceive a mountain without a valley or a sum of one and two which would not
<br>
be three, and so on, and that such things imply contradictions in my
<br>
conception.&quot; (Letter to Arnauld, 29 July 1648).
<br>
<p>With respect to your example, Descartes would have to say he cannot conceive
<br>
of finding such an isomorphy in  3-space because God has given him such a
<br>
mind, but he dare not say that god could not find such a solution. Of course
<br>
you will say that this would be to change the axiom system. Descartes will
<br>
respond that this may not be so, to assume that it must be the case is to
<br>
assume that your understanding extends as far as God's will along this
<br>
vector. Of course what the transhumanist fideist must do here is substitute
<br>
a created God III here for God.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn't warm to my last analogy but let me try another. Children
<br>
sometimes have a difficult time grasping the concept of volume, the usual
<br>
mistake is to think that a squat beaker which holds say 300 ml is smaller
<br>
than a tall slender beaker of equal volume. So if you ask a child what will
<br>
happen if you pour the contents of the full tall beaker into the empty squat
<br>
beaker they say that it will overflow. Even when one demonstrates that the
<br>
two beakers are of equal volume, by pouring the liquid from one to the
<br>
other, some still think that the taller beaker holds more liquid. They
<br>
sometimes think that there is some slight of hand going on. On this analogy,
<br>
then, what looks impossible to us, the 3-space solution may be like the
<br>
child thinking that the two beakers are equivalent in volume. To say that
<br>
any solution requires changing the axioms is like the child saying there
<br>
must be some slight of hand--what the child believes is impossible is indeed
<br>
entirely possible. The fideist response then is whether you might believe
<br>
the magnificently powerful being who claims to be a God III and says that
<br>
there is a 3-space solution within the axioms given, it is just that humans
<br>
are too stupid to understand it. Could you imagine your trust going this
<br>
far?
