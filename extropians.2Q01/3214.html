60% of American scientists, according to that poll a few years ago which
<br>
repeated one from the 1930s.  90% of NAS members.  95% of NAS biologists (the
<br>
high), 5/6 of NAS mathematicians (the low).  I really wanted to see the full
<br>
breakdown.
<br>
<p>Lots of Caltech undergrads, too, although no one ever did a poll, and
<br>
estimation is hard given the self-segregation.  Two houses were full of
<br>
atheists, agnostics, pagans, shock-value-pseudo-Satanists, and Campus Crusade
<br>
for Cthulhu folks, with occasional quiet Christians; the other five managed to
<br>
support the Christian Fellowship, which is not to imply they were dominated by
<br>
Christians, but I really don't know the percentages.
<br>
<p>Bet that was more than you wanted to know.
<br>
<p>I have heard anecdotal evidence that non-Christian American women are less
<br>
likely to be full-out atheist or agnostic, though, as opposed to some vague
<br>
spirituality.
