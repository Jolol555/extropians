<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, I have this wacky idea that says it's ethically prohibited to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apply Bayesian priors to people.  In other words, you should judge a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person's properties - intelligence levels, for example - only by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information that is directly revealing of those properties, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through other properties that happen to be weakly or strongly associated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially if those properties happen to be outside the person's direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manipulative control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a generous position, to judge each person only by their actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than other attributes.  No doubt in your own case since you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a highly unusual person, you would be frequently misjudged when other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics are used.
</em><br>
<p>Totally, unequivocally CAUGHT over on this end.  Yes, this particular
<br>
ethical heuristic is largely derived from the way I wish I'd been treated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; For example, if a nine-year-old were to walk up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me and ask a question that I would take seriously if an adult had asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it, I am obliged to answer as I would an adult, and am not permitted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take any action predicated on my knowledge of chronological age until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person in question makes some statement that is actually revealing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nine-year-old characteristics.  (Not in the sense of &quot;being interpretable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as being revealing of youth&quot;, but in the sense of being a statement that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would *only* have been generated by a youth and not by an adult, or a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; high-probability equivalent of same.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect that you're going to end up talking over the heads of a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nine year olds with this policy.  A more practical approach would be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask a few clarifying questions to get an idea of the child's knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maturity before attempting to answer.  Maybe the kid really is bright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and knowledgeable and would appreciate a detailed response, but maybe he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just accidentally asked a deep question (three year olds are especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good at this).
</em><br>
<p>If you talk over the &quot;kid's&quot; head (I said &quot;nine-year-old&quot;, not &quot;kid&quot;),
<br>
she'll go &quot;Huh?&quot; or &quot;What?&quot; or presumably make some other comment
<br>
indicative of nonadulthood.  Until she does so, I wouldn't want to ask &quot;a
<br>
few clarifying questions&quot; that I wouldn't ask an adult.  Wouldn't you be a
<br>
bit offended if you asked me a question about Friendly AI and I said
<br>
&quot;Well, do you know how computers work?&quot;  That's one of the reasons the
<br>
ethical action differs from the Bayesian prediction - there's a
<br>
qualitatively different penalty for underestimation relative to the
<br>
penalty for overestimation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So if someone says &quot;I'm smarter than you, Eliezer!&quot; I would certainly feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obliged to assume (or rather, act under the assumption) that the person in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question is as likely to be smarter than me as I am to be smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them, at least until the person makes some other statement revealing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actual intelligence levels, which generally doesn't take too long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...assuming that you judge such a claim to be indicative of smartness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would presumably depend on the context.
</em><br>
<p>No, I just judge the claim to be an ethical, if not Bayesian, indicator of
<br>
symmetry.  Human ethics is to some extent about the behaviors that you
<br>
implement yourself because you want them to be implemented globally, and a
<br>
global conduct needs some way of resolving symmetrical statements about
<br>
intelligence.  If a 10,000,000:1 genius confronts a 100,000:1 genius,
<br>
their Bayesian priors may be quantitatively different, but their
<br>
self-sensory experiences of cognitive structures (&quot;It is improbable that I
<br>
will run into someone smarter than me&quot;) are qualitatively identical.
