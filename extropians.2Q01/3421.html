</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>My scanners cross the generational gaps with a fair amount of ease, and
<br>
this term stems from an old-world concept of woman as &quot;young.&quot;  I write and
<br>
lecture a lot  on culture, especially  how others cultures affect
<br>
transhumanist and visa versa.
<br>
<p>There are a number of trends that come and go, while others stick like
<br>
post-its on our vocabularies.  The current trends are to make women
<br>
stronger, more powerful and capable in the medium of film; while in music
<br>
videos the style depends on who the musician is and the directorial style.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm seeing a trend in the media towards very bright, kick-ass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(as well as attractive) women, e.g. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dark Angel, Relic Hunter, Xena, Lara Croft, etc.  Some press I've
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In part, but more on what attracts the attention of the buying public.
<br>
Entertainment industry executives are more interested in profitable
<br>
artistic productions than their positions.  They are more sophisticated in
<br>
business to fall into the latter thinking, although it certainly is an
<br>
aspect of their individuality and what they bring to the table.  Inasmuch,
<br>
subcultures dictate to the execs.  For example, just as there is a growth
<br>
factor emphasizing kick-ass (which I love) phrases, there is the work done
<br>
by execs such as Lansing and Winfrey or Hawn who bring out the spirit of
<br>
women in their maternal and caregiver attributes while highlighting these
<br>
roles and make a heck of a lot of profit from them.  There are other
<br>
examples to be sure, but I am simplifying for lack of time.
