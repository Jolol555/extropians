<p>The official story is plausible.  Hoof and mouth is an RNA virus, has a
<br>
high mutation rate, and tends to generate new epidemics rather like
<br>
influenza.  However, since it's RNA, your idea is actually testable if
<br>
somebody collects the various infective strains.  RNA viruses
<br>
evolve so fast their sequence changes from infection to infection;
<br>
they evolve under your eyes, as it were.  You can tree out the
<br>
viruses like a geneology.  If the infection is being sown deliberately, 
<br>
all the different strains will tree out like siblings or same-generation
<br>
cousins, as they don't descend from each other.  If it spreads 
<br>
naturally, it will have a more complex tree with parent-child and
<br>
aunt-neice relationships, *and* those relationships will match up
<br>
with contact tracing. (e.g., if a Cornwall strain shows up in Spain,
<br>
you will usually find something to have transmitted it)
<br>
<p>IMO Argentina has the right idea - vaccinate.  Europe doesn't want
<br>
to as then they can't identify infected livestock (vaccinees have
<br>
antibodies).  Seems a pretty goofy case of confusing end and means.
<br>
I'm glad such people don't run tuberculosis policy!
