Note: this is not intended as a slam, but as constructive criticism of one small aspect of the work. Thanks to Mike and
<br>
E_Shaun for the information.

<p>Thanks for making that obvious. Ischemia management is of course important, but that's already known. 
<br>
<p>Neither &quot;ischemia management&quot; nor ischemia control&quot; is the same thing as resuscitation; it is a factor which ought to
<br>
make resuscitation easier (because damage ought to be less severe). Its placement in a sentence of the parallel
<br>
structure form is a big speedbump. The sentence is constructed to talk about two things and the third comes out of
<br>
nowhere, placed so a native speaker of English would expect a meaning like &quot;aka&quot;, &quot;viz.&quot;, or, more weakly, &quot;i.e.&quot;.
<br>
<p>I can imagine a great number of reasons why the word &quot;ischemia&quot; might be relevant. That is not the same thing at all as
<br>
correctly determining the writers' intent. In this case, I suggest the writers touch it up to improve readability.
<br>
<p>I found it a disjointed rhetorical excrescence which interfered with making sense of what was being said, and if the
<br>
purpose is to communicate, that section of text could profitably be improved. I can guess what is meant, but I shouldn't
<br>
have to.
