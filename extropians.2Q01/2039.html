<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proof for Goldbach's conjecture
<br>
<p>The purpose of this article is proving that each even number is sum of
<br>
two prime numbers. For this, we first should prove that for an infinitely
<br>
large even number there exist infinite pairs of odd numbers that the sum of
<br>
the members of each pair is equal to the even number.
<br>
Let's write the series 3, 5, 7, ... in a row named &quot;A&quot;
<br>
and just under it write the series of the even numbers 6, 8, 10, ... in a
<br>
row named &quot;B&quot;:
<br>
<p>_A: 03 05 07 09 11 13 15 17 ...
<br>
_B: 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 ...
<br>
C3: 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 ...
<br>
C5: 00 00 01 01 01 01 01 01 ...
<br>
C7: 00 00 00 00 01 01 01 01 ...
<br>
C9: 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 ...
<br>
<p>_D: 01 01 02 02 03 03 04 04 ...
<br>
<p>There is a relation between the numbers in the row A and in the row B:
<br>
3+3 from A is 6 from B, 3+5 from A is 8 from B, 3+7 from A is 10 from B,
<br>
...
<br>
We show this relation by the numbers of 1 in the row C3. Also 5+5 from A is
<br>
10 from B, 5+7 from A is 12 from B, 5+9 from A is 14 from B, .... We show
<br>
this relation by the numbers of 1 in the row C5. Also 7+7 from A is 14 from
<br>
B, 7+9 from A is 16 from B, 7+11 from A is 18 from B, .... We show this
<br>
relation by the numbers of 1 in the row C7.
<br>
We can continue this procedure.
<br>
<p>Each item in a column of the row D is the sum of all the items in the same
<br>
column of the rows Cn. In this manner each item in a column of the row D
<br>
is the number of all the pairs of odd numbers that the sum of the members
<br>
of each pair is the even number of this column (of the row B).
<br>
<p>As we can easily see, in the row A the horizontal distance between each odd
<br>
number and the first next odd number in the column of which there is an even
<br>
number which is sum of this odd number and itself, is as large as the
<br>
horizontal distance between this odd number and the first number in the row
<br>
A. (For example the horizontal distance between 9 and the column containing
<br>
18(=9+9) is three units, and the horizontal distance between 9 and the first
<br>
number in the row A, ie 3, is also three units.) Let's call such a distance
<br>
as a &quot;triangular distance&quot; related to the odd number (eg the triangular
<br>
distance related to 9 in the row A is (9  8  11  13  15) the length of
<br>
which is three units).
<br>
<p>It is clear that the series 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ... approaches infinity.
<br>
Let's choose an odd number and make the triangular distance of it and as
<br>
soon as such making subtract one unit from each number in the row D which is
<br>
in the same column in which a member of this triangular distance is, and
<br>
let's substitute the obtained series for the old series (here the series D).
<br>
By this work we are subtracting the number of all the pairs of odd numbers,
<br>
the bigger member of each being our chosen odd number, from the numbers of
<br>
pairs (of odd numbers) written in the row D. Now let's choose a bigger odd
<br>
number and perform the same above procedure to obtain a new series. For
<br>
instance for the odd numbers 9, 11, 15, 19 and 23 we get the following sets
<br>
of series Dn from the initial series D:
<br>
<p>__A: 03 05 07 09 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 ...
<br>
__B: 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 ...
<br>
__D: 01 01 02 02 03 03 04 04 05 05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09 09 10 10 11 11 ...
<br>
_D9: 00 00 00(01 02 02 03)04 05 05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09 09 10 10 11 11 ...
<br>
D11: 00 00 00 00(01 01 02 03 04)05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09 09 10 10 11 11 ...
<br>
D15: 00 00 00 00 00 00(00 02 03 04 05 05 06)07 08 08 09 09 10 10 11 11 ...
<br>
D19: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00(02 03 04 04 05 06 07 07 08)09 10 10 11 11 ...
<br>
D23: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00(03 03 04 05 06 06 07 08 09 09 10)11 ...
<br>
<p>As it is seen, the first number in each series which is right-adjacent
<br>
to the triangular distance is equal to the number of the members of the
<br>
triangular distance. It's evident that for an infinite odd number this
<br>
first number, right-adjacent to the triangular distance of this odd
<br>
number, is an infinitely large number. If the triangular distances of the
<br>
successive odd numbers bigger than our odd number are to subtract one by
<br>
one from this infinite number through one-by-one rightward advance of the
<br>
triangular distances (in the successive stages ie in the successive rows
<br>
caused by the next triangular distances, just as eg the second 4 in the
<br>
row D has been changed into 2 in the row D15 after three times rightward
<br>
advancing of the triangular distances), we can say that the advance speed of
<br>
the left border of the triangular distance (ie eg the mark &quot;(&quot; in the
<br>
above rows) toward this infinite number is equal to the rate of subtraction
<br>
from infinity, and finally, when this border reaches this infinite number,
<br>
there will be no infinite number but a finite number (because as we saw, the
<br>
number of the members of the triangular distance is equal to that number
<br>
which is immediately right-adjacent to this distance).
<br>
<p>Now suppose that instead of the above successive triangular distances of
<br>
successive odd numbers we have only triangular distances of those odd
<br>
numbers that are not prime. In such a case since we know the number 
<br>
of primes is infinite, the row by row triangular subtractions are not one 
<br>
by one, ie this is not the case that the left border of the triangular distance 
<br>
(ie &quot;(&quot;) in a row is always only one unit farther than this border in the previous
<br>
row (towards right), but the advance of this left border towards right is
<br>
sometimes impulsive (not one by one), because it is to consist only of the
<br>
(eliminating) triangular distances of the odd numbers which are not prime
<br>
and we know we have infinite prime (odd) numbers up to infinity. Thus, when
<br>
this left border reaches our infinite number, it will have subtracted an
<br>
amount from our infinite number smaller than the largeness of this infinite
<br>
number. It's clear that the amount remained of this infinite number (after
<br>
these subtractions) is equal to the total number of the primes existent in
<br>
an infinite continuous distance of natural numbers. And we know this number
<br>
is itself an infinite number. Thus in fact when all the possible triangular
<br>
distances have done their subtractions from the infinite number during their
<br>
advance towards this number the remaining number is still infinitely large.
<br>
(As the number of primes in the distance (1,infinity) is infinite, the
<br>
number of primes in the distance (infinity/2,infinity) is also infinite, 
<br>
because otherwise we must accept that there is an upper bound for 
<br>
the primes in this distance which is not smaller than the infinity existent in
<br>
(infinity/2,infinity), and consequently it must be also an upper bound (for
<br>
the primes) in (1,infinity) (since the infinity existent in (1,infinity) is
<br>
the same infinity existent in (infinity/2,infinity)), but we know existence
<br>
of any upper bound for the primes in (1,infinity) is not possible.) This
<br>
means that for an infinite even number the numnber of pairs of odd numbers,
<br>
the sum of the numbers of each being the even number and the bigger number
<br>
of each pair being a prime, is infinite. Let's call each pair of odd numbers the
<br>
sum of the numbers of which is an even number as a constructive pair of the
<br>
mentioned even number. Therefore, if an even number approaches infinity the
<br>
number of its constructive pairs, the bigger number of each of which is a
<br>
prime, will also approaches infinity. (Notice that in the eliminating
<br>
mechanism presented above, pairs like (9,11) or (15,19) won't be eliminated,
<br>
because in each pair while the smaller number is not a prime the bigger
<br>
number is a prime.)
<br>
<p>In addition, as it is evident in the process of the proof, for an even
<br>
number there are no prime numbers other than those constituting the set of
<br>
the bigger numbers of its constructive pairs between the smallest and
<br>
biggest numbers of these bigger numbers of these pairs. This means that
<br>
the mentioned set is a continuous set of primes. Is it possible that for
<br>
an infinitely large even number none of the smaller numbers of its
<br>
constructive pairs is prime? No, it is not possible, because infinity/2
<br>
is not a finite number. Explanation: Suppose that the statement P is
<br>
true for each member of the infinite distance (1,infinity). In such a case
<br>
we can consider infinity as a member of this distance and say that P is true
<br>
for it, and of course this means that P is true for every number of this
<br>
distance which is greater than a chosen number. It is possible that several
<br>
statements are true separately for different members of this distance,
<br>
for instance P1 for the distance (1,100) and P2 for (100,1000000) and P3
<br>
for (1000000,infinity) in which again we can consider infinity as a member
<br>
for which the statement P3 is true. What is important in dealing with
<br>
infinity as a member is that the statement for infinity must be clear and
<br>
determined. Now suppose that for the finite distance (1,n) the statement is
<br>
that firstly n/2 is determined and secondly (after performing the above
<br>
eliminating mechanism) all the bigger numbers of the constructive pairs
<br>
of the number which is immediately right-adjacent to this distance
<br>
construct all the members of the distance (n/2,n) and none of the smaller
<br>
numbers of these pairs belongs to the distance (1,n/2). In which case can
<br>
this statement be true for the infinite distance (1,infinity)? When at least
<br>
infinity/2 is determined, but we know this is not the case. In a similar
<br>
manner we must conclude that in principle the set of the prime numbers of
<br>
these smaller numbers of the pairs is not a finite set since otherwise we
<br>
can eliminate the pairs related to them and again have an infinite set the
<br>
center of which must be determined.
<br>
<p>In this manner we showed that when the even number approaches infinity
<br>
the number of its constructive pairs, both numbers of which being primes,
<br>
approaches infinity. Now consider the function of the number of those
<br>
constructive pairs of even numbers both members of each of which are
<br>
primes. We proved that this function has an (infinite) limit in infinity;
<br>
then it is a well-behaved function (ie its general tendency on sufficiently
<br>
large continuous distances of its domain is not unpredictable). On the
<br>
other hand, as initial values, we know that on a large continuous
<br>
distance of the first portion of the domain of this function
<br>
this function takes positive values which are ascending on average.
<br>
Since this function is well-behaved and is positive and averagely
<br>
ascending at the first and has a tendency towards infinity at the end,
<br>
we conclude that it cannot have an abrupt fall toward zero at any other
<br>
point of its domain.
<br>
<p>(If through some way other than that the function has an (infinite) limit
<br>
in infinity we accepted that the function was well-behaved, could we
<br>
conclude only from its general ascending tendency at the first that,
<br>
up to infinity, it would have an ascending tendency? Obviously not,
<br>
because in such a case we couldn't be certain that our well-behaved
<br>
function not to start falling towards zero at a point.) In this
<br>
manner we have shown that every even number is sum of (the members of
<br>
at least one pair consisting of) two primes.
