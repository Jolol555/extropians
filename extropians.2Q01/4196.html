<p><em>&gt; For example, suppose that you're on a game show called &quot;ExtroQuiz&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are three doors:  A, B, and C.  One door has a prize behind it.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pick door C.  The game show host opens up door A, and shows you that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empty.  What is the probability that the prize is behind door B?  Answer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0%.  Why?  Because the game show host *knows* the standard answer to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; riddle, *knows* that most Extropians will switch to B, and he opens A *if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and only if* the prize is actually behind C.
</em><br>
<p>Another way to illustrate why it is best to switch doors after Monte
<br>
opens one is by restating the game thus:  Monte offers you one of the
<br>
three doors, but before you choose, he writes a letter on a card and
<br>
places it face down.  This is the letter of a door that he knows has a
<br>
goat behind it.  He says that after you choose a door, which might be
<br>
the one he wrote, he will reveal the door written on the card.  That
<br>
illustration may help some to understand why its best to switch, assuming
<br>
one prize and two zonks.
<br>
<p>Eliezer's contention is incorrect methinks.  If you choose C and it is a
<br>
zonk, Monte must open A, for he knows B is the prize.  If you choose
<br>
C and it has the prize, Monte can open either A or B, and then you
<br>
switch and get zonked.  So assuming Mr. Hall wishes to zonk you,
<br>
he can do so only if you originally chose the prize door, 1/3 chance.
