<p>Let us rid society of genetic defects, says DNA pioneer

<p>Leading article: Genetic research to eliminate disease should not be 
<br>
prevented by fear
<br>
James Watson, the &quot;father&quot; of DNA science, has called for the law to be 
<br>
changed so that scientists can alter the genes of sperm, eggs and embryos 
<br>
and so rid genetic defects from future generations.
<br>
<p>Dr Watson, who with Francis Crick shared a Nobel prize for the discovery of 
<br>
the DNA double helix in 1953, says that fears over the creation of &quot;designer 
<br>
babies&quot; are misplaced and that the potential benefits of controlling the 
<br>
ultimate engine of human evolution far outweigh the risks.
<br>
<p>Altering the genes of sperm, eggs and embryos ­ so-called germ-line gene 
<br>
therapy ­ is specifically outlawed in Britain, America and many other 
<br>
countries, ostensibly because of the risks of meddling with genetic material 
<br>
and introducing possible side-effects that will be passed on to subsequent 
<br>
generations. There are alsoethical and moral concerns about tinkering with 
<br>
human DNA to improve a family's genetic stock either by eliminating &quot;bad&quot; 
<br>
genes or introducing &quot;good&quot; ones. Critics say it raises the spectre of 
<br>
eugenics, as practised by the Nazis.
<br>
<p>Dr Watson, who played a formative role in the human genome project and is 
<br>
president of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, 
<br>
argues passionately in The Independent today for society to review its 
<br>
opposition to germ-line gene therapy.
<br>
<p>&quot;I strongly favour controlling our children's genetic destinies. Working 
<br>
intelligently and wisely to see that good genes dominate as many lives as 
<br>
possible is the truly moral way for us to proceed,&quot; Dr Watson writes.
<br>
<p>Answering those who even oppose the genetic modification of plants and 
<br>
animals, he says: &quot;To my knowledge, not one illness, much less fatality, has 
<br>
been caused by a genetically manipulated organism.&quot;
<br>
<p>Attempts to prevent germ-line gene therapy on humans are reminiscent of the 
<br>
measures designed to limit the use of DNA manipulation 25 years ago when 
<br>
scientists agreed to a temporary moratorium on the technology, Dr Watson 
<br>
says.
<br>
<p>&quot;The moral I draw from this painful episode is this: never postpone 
<br>
experiments that have clearly defined future benefits for fear of dangers 
<br>
that cannot be quantified,&quot; he says.
