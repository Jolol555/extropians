<br>
<p>Stem cells &quot;holy grail&quot; in restoring damaged hearts
<br>
<p>In an article to be published in the April 5 2001 issue of the journal
<br>
Nature, research involving the implantation of bone marrow stem cells into
<br>
the hearts of mice who had undergone heart attacks found that stem cells
<br>
were able to form new heart muscle in 68% of damaged tissue nine days
<br>
after transplantation. Heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when
<br>
one of the vessels supplying blood to the heart becomes narrowed or
<br>
blocked by the formation of plaque, known as atherosclerosis, or when a
<br>
blood clot blocks an area of a vessel. The resultant lack of blood flow to
<br>
the heart muscle causes tissue death, or what is known as an infarction.
<br>
Until now, there was no known way to regenerate this damaged tissue.
<br>
<p>Researchers at New York Medical College harvested stem cells from the bone
<br>
marrow of male mice who were genetically engineered to express a
<br>
fluorescent protein. These stem cells were injected into the hearts of
<br>
female mice in whom myocardial infarction had been experimentally induced.
<br>
The fluorescent protein and the presence of the Y chromosome in the
<br>
male-derived cells enabled the researchers to identify the cells when
<br>
examining the transplant recipients. The researchers speculated that the
<br>
mice who rejected the transplants may have done so because of the Y
<br>
chromosome or because of the difficulty in transplanting cells into
<br>
rapidly beating tissue.  Nonetheless, the transplants were successful in
<br>
twelve of the thirty-one mice who received them. These mice formed new
<br>
heart muscle cells, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, which led
<br>
to the formation of new blood vessels in the restored areas.
<br>
<p>Bone marrow is proving to be an ideal source of stem cells, eliminating
<br>
patient rejection when harvested from the patient to be treated, and
<br>
avoiding the ethical concerns of embryonic stem cell usage. This is the
<br>
first time that bone marrow derived stem cells have been used in vivo to
<br>
regenerate dead heart muscle. Research team leader Piero Anversa has
<br>
predicted that stem cells will be used clinically to to restore heart
<br>
function in as little as three years.
<br>
<p>In a News and Views article in the same issue of Nature, Mark Sussman of
<br>
Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati commented, &quot;Cardiac stem
<br>
cells have been the Holy Grail of cardiovascular researchers working to
<br>
find a way to replace damaged heart tissue.&quot;
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
<p>Fitness predicts all-cause mortality risk
<br>
<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness has proven to be a reliable indicator of risk of
<br>
death from cardiovascular causes and to a smaller extent, from cancer, in
<br>
several prospective studies, comparable to that of such risk factors as
<br>
high cholesterol and smoking. A study of 1,294 Finnish men revealed that
<br>
not only is cardiorespiratory fitness a reliable indicator of heart
<br>
disease death, it as a good predictor of all cause mortality.
<br>
<p>The study, published in the March 26 2001 issue of Annals of Internal
<br>
Medicine, utilized middle-aged men who were participants in the Kuopio
<br>
Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study in Finland. Men who had any heart
<br>
or respiratory conditions were excluded. Participants were enrolled
<br>
between 1984 and 1989. Researchers measured maximal oxygen uptake as a
<br>
measure of cardiovascular fitness at the beginning of the study. This is a
<br>
quantification of the amount of oxygen consumed during exercise, which
<br>
provides an assessment of cardiac, circulatory and respiratory function.
<br>
Exercise endurance was also measured.
<br>
<p>During follow-up, which concluded at the end of 1997, there were
<br>
eighty-two deaths from noncardiovascular causes and forty-two deaths from
<br>
cardiovascular causes. After adjustment for other risk factors such as age
<br>
and smoking status, low cardiorespiratory fitness as determined by low
<br>
maximal oxygen uptake was associated with a 2.76-fold increase in overall
<br>
mortality during the study period compared with those with a high maximal
<br>
oxygen uptake. Short exercise duration was associated with a slightly
<br>
lower risk, when the group with the lowest results was compared to that
<br>
with the highest. Additional adjustment for other risk factors such as
<br>
serum triglycerides, HDL, LDL, blood pressure, fibrinogen, diabetes, and
<br>
insulin levels did not significantly change these associations. The risk
<br>
of mortality during this time period associated with low maximal oxygen
<br>
uptake and exercise duration were similar when noncardiovascular mortality
<br>
was examined separately, and was higher when cardiovascular mortality
<br>
alone was studied.
<br>
<p>The study suggests thirty minutes a day of moderate physical activity to
<br>
promote health and prevent chronic disease.

<p>Vitamin E and oats prevent detrimental effects of high fat meals
<br>
<p>In a study published in the February 2000 issue of the American Journal of
<br>
Preventive Medicine, both vitamin E and oats were demonstrated to prevent
<br>
one of the undesirable effects of consuming a high fat meal. Consuming
<br>
high fat foods is known to cause constriction of the arteries, restricting
<br>
blood flow.
<br>
<p>Researchers at Yale University recruited twenty-five men and twenty-five
<br>
women to participate in a randomized, crossover study. The participants
<br>
were nonsmokers, free of known vascular disease, but were chosen from
<br>
different age groups most likely to be at risk for subclinical
<br>
atherosclerosis for each sex. All of the women in the study were
<br>
postmenopausal. Subjects were asked to consume a high-fat meal on three
<br>
occasions one week apart. Each meal was randomly followed by 800 iu
<br>
vitamin E, oatmeal containing beta-glucan or a wheat cereal. Prior to
<br>
consuming the high-fat meal, and following the meal, the participants
<br>
received brachial artery reactivity studies by ultrasound to measure
<br>
arterial endothelial function. While consumption of wheat cereal was found
<br>
to do nothing to halt the decline in endothelial function following a
<br>
high-fat meal, both the ingestion of oats and vitamin E were associated
<br>
with no change in brachial artery flow. The authors conclude that the
<br>
consumption of oats or vitamin E, but not wheat prevent the endothelial
<br>
dysfunction induced by acute fat ingestion in healthy adults, and stress
<br>
the importance of nutrient distribution and meal composition in
<br>
cardiovascular health.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Exercise enhancement and risk avoidance by Will Brink
<br>
<p>Many people have turned exercise into an intensive daily routine, as there
<br>
are enormous benefits associated with a nonsedentary lifestyle. While
<br>
exercise can improve our lives, health, outlook and functional life span,
<br>
there are potential negative consequences if one fails to protect against
<br>
the known side effects of excess physical exertion.
<br>
<p>Despite mountains of data documenting the benefits of safe exercise, the
<br>
public is largely ignorant of the molecular effects that overexertion
<br>
places on the body in the short and long-term. This protocol will
<br>
enlighten the physically active enthusiast about how to enhance the
<br>
effects of exercise, protect against its negative effects, and increase
<br>
energy levels so that longer workout periods are possible.
<br>
<p>Where do we even start to explain the total benefits of exercise? Several
<br>
studies have shown that regular exercise can extend life span by an
<br>
average of 2 years. Much more important perhaps, exercise greatly
<br>
increases functional life span. Getting older does not have to be the
<br>
downward spiral of lost functionality in every day life, and any older
<br>
person who has incorporated exercise into their schedule throughout their
<br>
life can attest to that.
<br>
<p>Moderate exercise has been shown to improve immunity, reduce body fat, and
<br>
improve mood states. Regular exercise can greatly improve glucose
<br>
metabolism and insulin sensitivity, reduce cholesterol levels, and help to
<br>
prevent so many diseases it would take an entire book to even list them
<br>
all! What else do we need to say?

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Gamma E tocopherol
<br>
<p>If you take vitamin E, you're probably not getting its full benefits!
<br>
Almost all vitamin E supplements contain alpha tocopherol, but not gamma
<br>
tocopherol. It doesn't matter whether you take natural or synthetic
<br>
vitamin E, the form used is almost always alpha. There's nothing wrong
<br>
with alpha tocopherol, but if you expect to obtain optimal antioxidant
<br>
protection, you should take gamma tocopherol.
<br>
<p>A study in Proceedings of the National Academy if Sciences (April 1997)
<br>
suggests that it could be dangerous to take high doses of alpha tocopherol
<br>
without also consuming gamma tocopherol. What made this study interesting
<br>
was that it showed that high doses of alpha tocopherol can displace gamma
<br>
tocopherol in tissues. While alpha tocopherol inhibits the production of
<br>
free radicals to some degree, it is gamma tocopherol that is required to
<br>
trap and neutralize existing free radicals.
