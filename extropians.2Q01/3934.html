<p>Mercaptanes poison platinum group metal electrodes in fuel cells quite

quickly, unfortunately. Only high temperature fuel cells are more or

less immune to them, and you can directly use methan in them.

<p>Hydrogen flame is not that invisible, and it doesn't radiate much

because it doesn't have hot soot radiating as blackbody.

<p><em>&gt; One thing that will probably keep natural gas as the fuel of choice is that

<p>That's an urban legend. It happened in the early days of ammonia synthesis,
<br>
but you'll notice the pressure and the temperature at which that synthesis
<br>
is conducted. At normal conditions you can use steel pipe just fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; hydrogen burns with a colorless flame (it does emit UV, that's how you can

</em><br>
<p>I don't think that's a problem in reality. But the point is that to start
<br>
using hydrogen you can stick to the old methane pipelines. Just just make
<br>
hydrogen when you need it.
