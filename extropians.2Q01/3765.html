So why aspire to be one?

more about the human brain.

<p><em>&gt; Godelian-flavoured intrinsic system limitation. As I said, I'm looking

<p>But what's the system?  We're too limited to design Pentium's unaided.

Fortunately we're aided.
<br>
<p>I also doubt an evolved AI would lead to Singularity.  Say we evolve one --
<br>
which may not be that easy, given how tortuous the path to us seems -- then
<br>
what?  We've got a cryptic mess of intelligent code.  It's more amenable to
<br>
controlled experiments and eventualy modification thatn we are, but still
<br>
pretty abstruse as far as self-modification -- the core Singularity path --
<br>
goes.  The fun stuff happens if the AI has coherent high level structure, so
<br>
mutations have large effect, and design space gets explored quickly.
<br>
<p>And I'd avoid this fetishism of low-level evolutionary processes.  It's all
<br>
Darwinism ultimately, from gene mutations to high level thoughts.  But a child
<br>
learning chess may try to move anywhere, and be swatted away from illegal
<br>
moves.  A chess program only explores legal moves.  A human grandmaster only
<br>
explores good moves.  If she gets stuck, then she can try relaxing constraints
<br>
(although going down to genetic mutations to develop better chess players is
<br>
kind of breaking the example.)  But that's the last resort, not the first.
