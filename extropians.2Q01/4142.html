<p>It's really interesting to see somebody thinks about this stuff.  I've long
<br>
been interested about the Sung/Ming dichotomy; the Sung were so 
<br>
technologically innovative and the Ming so conservative.  I've seen 
<br>
tertiary sources claiming the Sung were close to an industrial revolution
<br>
when the Mongols finally managed to take them out.  In contrast,
<br>
the Sung had a bad military track record while the Ming were the 
<br>
terror of East Asia for quite some time.  I wrote on this in college
<br>
(specifically why the Sung had such a lousy offensive military) and was 
<br>
depressed to find how little information on the Sung was available
<br>
even at the University of Chicago, which has one of the best libraries
<br>
in America.  
<br>
<p>Do you have any sourcces you can point me to on the conservatising cultural
<br>
innovations of the Ming or the sources of Sung technical dynamism?
