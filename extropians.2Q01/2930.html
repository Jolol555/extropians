<p>Because it's not fail-safe.

<p>An axe and a live crewman are not going to accidentally toast all your
<br>
avionics and set fire to the airframe if there's a short in the detonator
<br>
electronics. 
<br>
<p>And if there's a fire on board, you don't want equipment racks adding
<br>
to the !fun by exploding around the crew who're trying to control it.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, much of the equipment will have been custom-designed.
<br>
Surely it'd be possible to wire a couple of rails inside the equipment
<br>
racks to opposite poles of a 415 volt three-phase supply, separated by
<br>
something low-tech like a knife switch locked behind a panel saying IN
<br>
EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS? It's amazing what a few kilowatts will do to
<br>
delicate electronics -- without requiring high explosives inside a
<br>
pressurised cabin.
