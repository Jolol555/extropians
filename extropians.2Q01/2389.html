<p>This jogged a memory of college days, 20 yrs ago, when
<br>
fellow students and I discussed an ancient variant of the
<br>
current uploading idea.  This was before nanotech and
<br>
Drexler and such as that, but we did have rudimentary
<br>
computers, sort of, and neural nets were all the rage then.
<br>
<p>We had the notion that if an appropriate neural net computer
<br>
could be carried around with one, then the computer would
<br>
observe all conditions and how the person reacted under
<br>
those conditions.  This observation/learning phase would go
<br>
on for many years, creating a giant state-machine-like
<br>
table, that would tell the computer how the person would
<br>
react in any given sitch.  Then when the human perished, the
<br>
software would immitate the human, perhaps even being
<br>
loaded into a droid with the appearance of the deceased,
<br>
thereby easing the mourning process for the bereaved survivors.
<br>
<p>In those days we had no concept of actually downloading
<br>
*ourselves* into a machine, only creating a self-like process
<br>
to carry on, in a sense.  spike
