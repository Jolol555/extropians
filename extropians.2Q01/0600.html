Lord, I leave the list for a few months and the response
<br>
quality falls into the basement.... :-;
<br>
<p>Now, while Hal and Curt attempted to respond to Robin's
<br>
question, I don't really think they did.
<br>
<p>Robin wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The last common ancestor of mice and men probably lived 100m 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago. Yet according to Dr Venter, the firm's scientists have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found only 300 genes that people have and mice do not.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone seen the answer to this question: On how many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes do two typical humans differ?
</em><br>
<p>To start with the question isn't phrased well (for technical
<br>
resons I will get to).  Given the statements that seem to be
<br>
motivating it, I think Robin may be asking:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do humans have different numbers of genes?&quot;
<br>
If that is the case, then my answer would be very very rarely.
<br>
All mammals have essentially the same &quot;gene set&quot;.  As pointed
<br>
out by Venter, only a few hundred are gained or lost between
<br>
humans and mice.  Most of what has been going on in the evolution
<br>
of higher animals is a lot of chromsome breaks where the genes
<br>
get put back together differently.  There is also some evolution
<br>
driven by retrotransposons moving genes or gene regions around.
<br>
<p>The technical problem with Robin's query is that it begs
<br>
the question of what a &quot;gene&quot; is.  The simple 1-gene = 1-protein
<br>
model is pretty much dead and buried for higher organisms,
<br>
particularly mammals.  We may only have 30,000 genes but we
<br>
probably produce 140,000+ mRNAs due to alternate splicing
<br>
and that may result in hundreds of thousands of proteins
<br>
due to post-translational modifications.
<br>
<p>The answers regarding polymorphisms do provide interesting
<br>
data that you can use to study natural rates of mutation and
<br>
evolution and degrees of relatedness between individuals,
<br>
populations and species.  However they don't tell you
<br>
very much about the protein differences that lead to
<br>
phenotype differences in humans.  The single nucleotide
<br>
polymorphisms (SNPs) where a single base is changed that
<br>
are outside of the gene (and its associated regulatory
<br>
regions) probably have no effect.  Those in genes that
<br>
change bases (A/C/G/T) where the DNA code is redundant
<br>
are not going to change the protein produced (and so
<br>
are probably irrelevant as well).  Even if you change
<br>
the amino-acid at that point in the protein, you would have
<br>
to change it to one with a radically different characteristics
<br>
(+ charged to - charged, hydrophobic to hydrophilic, etc.)
<br>
to have a mutation that seriously effects the protein produced.
<br>
So I don't think at this stage (without a *much* better
<br>
understanding of every protein that a single DNA &quot;gene&quot;
<br>
sequence produces) you can use SNP data to answer Robin's
<br>
question.  The protein mobility data does a better job
<br>
because it is dealing with the physical entities that
<br>
produce the phenotype of a body.  However, it too
<br>
may be complicated because a change in a single
<br>
gene involved in protein glycosylation or other
<br>
post-translational modifications could cause changes
<br>
in the mobility of *many* proteins.  So you can only
<br>
use this data to answer Robin's question if you make
<br>
sure the post-translational machinery is identical in
<br>
the individuals being tested.
<br>
<p>It could also be true, that there could exist individuals
<br>
with different DNA in a gene that functions in the
<br>
post-translational pathway that leads to different
<br>
post-translational modifications in the proteins
<br>
(so molecularly the individuals appear quite &quot;distinct&quot;).
<br>
However, if all of the other genes in these individuals
<br>
were &quot;identical&quot;, then the two individuals might be
<br>
virtually equivalent at the observed phenotype level.
<br>
Such a difference might only show up if the two individuals
<br>
were challenged with a microorganism or toxin that would
<br>
interact with the protein modifications of one individual
<br>
and not the other.  Such a micro-organism or toxin might
<br>
not even exist in the world.
<br>
<p>There are ~10,000 known human genetic diseases.  For most of these
<br>
we know that mutations in a single gene are the cause of the
<br>
disease.  So individuals with Cystic Fibrosis may be
<br>
phenotypically similar to each other (they have mutations
<br>
that give them the same disease) but show much different
<br>
severities in the disease.  This is because hundreds of different
<br>
mutations have been mapped to the CF gene which cause a greater
<br>
or lesser loss of function of that protein.  It isn't clear
<br>
to me whether Robin would consider these &quot;different&quot;.
<br>
<p>Though I don't have a reference, I believe I've seen data
<br>
that ~1/3 of the genes are developmental lethals.  I.e. any
<br>
&quot;significant&quot; mutations in them and you don't get a functional
<br>
organism.  So presumably 1/3 of the genes in humans are
<br>
essentially equivalent.
<br>
<p>Given all of the above I think one can only say that humans
<br>
may differ on up to around 20,000 genes.  To answer the
<br>
question in more detail is going to require more exact
<br>
definitions of the terms &quot;genes&quot;, &quot;typical&quot; and &quot;differ&quot;.
