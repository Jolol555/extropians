<em>&gt; &gt; You must be joking.  Saying that any human based creature is fully

<em>&gt; Hmm, how exactly do you interpret my sentence to mean what you oppose
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; if B is a logical consequence of A, and we get convinced about A, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we better accept B (and so on), not that we are perfectly rational
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pleasant everyday people.
</em><br>
<p>I stand corrected and apologized for the misinterpretation.  But somehow
<br>
I don't hear about the pleasant everyday people who happen to be
<br>
religious.  Usually here I only hear the word &quot;religious&quot; generally
<br>
closely followed by &quot;fanatic&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, if we start talking about direct brain surgery to change the minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of sentient beings then we are straying into &quot;anti-Christ&quot; territory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My view too. This is where ethics becomes relevant. Even when people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree about particulars or even the foundations of ethics, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to get a broad consensus about humans having a right to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives, bodies, thoughts and property (although the last is often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignored, despite being a corrolary of the first ones) as a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple default that can then be narrowed down by more complex ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems by adding more do's and dont's. I see it as a good first step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards a more sane society to get the mainstream to accept this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position as a kind of inter-group ethics and leave the rest to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups.
</em><br>
<p>Will we apply the same rights and ethics to &quot;artificial&quot; sentients? 
<br>
Once the AI becomes self-aware will we stop rewiring its mind without
<br>
its permission? 
<br>
If not, then why not?  If there is an acceptable why not then does it
<br>
also apply to wetware brains and beings once we understand well-enough
<br>
how they work?  Plenty of slippery slopes around here.
