<p><em>&gt;I think the far most common errors are those discussed in cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychology such as example bias (if you have an example of an event, you tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to overvalue how often that event occurs), nonlinear subjective utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;curves, self-serving bias (I am in control when things go well, it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accident when things go bad) etc. There are piles of fairly simple mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mistakes we do almost all the time, and getting rid of them is much work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just learning about them is a first step, but then you have to train yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to detect them and not make them.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Indeed. The best reference I know describing cognitive
<br>
distortion is David Burns': _Feeling Good_. A dense book with
<br>
powerful techniques to retrain the mind's old thinking patterns.
<br>
This book is about catching cognitive errors which, in turn, have a
<br>
large effect on a person's emotional state (read: &quot;depression&quot;).
<br>
<p>The exercises are really simple, and in fact I do a stupid short cut
<br>
alot, which it to do them in my head. However, our mind's thinking
<br>
pattern's truly don't change
<br>
_unless you take the time to put pen in hand, and write them out on paper_.
<br>
<p>(it makes a huge difference to write it out. I don't know why)
<br>
<p><p>So something from the book to familiarize people with these errors.

<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=====================
<br>
<p><p>ALL-OR-NOTHING THINKING:
<br>
You see things in black-and-white categories. If your performance
<br>
falls short of perfect, you see yourself as a total failure.
<br>
<p>OVERGENERALIZATION:
<br>
You see a single negative event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.
<br>
<p>MENTAL FILTER:
<br>
You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively so
<br>
that your vision of all reality becomes darkened, like the drop of
<br>
ink that discolors the entire beaker of water.
<br>
<p>DISQUALIFYING THE POSITIVE:
<br>
You reject positive experiences by insisting they ``don't count&quot; for
<br>
some reason or other.
<br>
<p>JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS:
<br>
You make a negative interpretation even though there are no definite
<br>
facts that convincingly support your conclusion.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Mind Reading: You arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negatively to you, and you don't bother to check this out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Fortune Teller Error: You anticipate that things will turn out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;badly, and you feel convinced that your prediction is an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already-established fact.
<br>
<p>MAGNIFICATION OR MINIMIZATION:
<br>
You exaggerate the importance of things, or you inappropriately
<br>
shrink things until they appear tiny.
<br>
<p>EMOTIONAL REASONING:
<br>
You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way
<br>
things really are: ``I feel it, therefore it must be true.&quot;
<br>
<p>SHOULD STATEMENTS:
<br>
You try to motivate yourself with shoulds and shouldn'ts, as if you
<br>
had to be whipped and punished before you could be expected to to do
<br>
anything. ``Musts&quot; and ``oughts&quot; are also offenders. The emotional
<br>
consequence is guilt. When you direct should statements toward
<br>
others, you feel anger, frustration, and resentment.
<br>
<p>LABELING AND MISLABELING:
<br>
This is an extreme form of overgeneralization. Instead of describing
<br>
your error, you attach a negative label to yourself. When someone
<br>
else's behavior rubs you the wrong way, you attach a negative label
<br>
to him/her.
<br>
<p>PERSONALIZATION:
<br>
You see yourself as the cause of some negative external event which
<br>
in fact you were not primarily responsible for.
