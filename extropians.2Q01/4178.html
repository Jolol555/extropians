<p><em>&gt; Next, I could argue that the term &quot;practical&quot; is misleading, too,

</em><br>
<p>I can't disagree with that. However, I was using the word &quot;practical&quot; in a
<br>
conversational way. It, too, has a commonly understood meaning that has nothing
<br>
to do with what you or I think.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Its only relevant
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; contructivism or irrationalism), is so tautologically good that it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need mentioning, except in debates about rationality.
</em><br>
<p>Well, sure. But again, I was only being conversational, using common language. I
<br>
wasn't really interested in its relevance to empirical rationalism. This is
<br>
something you've tacked on.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Now that you made some clarifications, I think that your message
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have been phrased in a meaningful, positively informative way;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you chose to make &quot;oversimplications&quot; (as you put it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is also an oversimplification of the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that led to your statements having an obvious fallacious interpretation):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you chose to resort to forms of expression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are loaded with meanings opposed to what you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as compared to what you later explained you meant or didn't mean),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to use common language in areas where it specifically fails.
</em><br>
<p>It was my decision to construct my post in the way I did. I had no interest
<br>
beyond that. My goal was to respond in a converstational manner to something
<br>
someone else had said, to agree by making my own perspective known. I'm sure it
<br>
could have been &quot;phrased in a meaningful, positively informative way,&quot; but that
<br>
was not my goal.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think putting conciseness before correction is just wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All the more since your post wasn't concise.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't trying to be concise. I was being conversational. This assumes that if
<br>
someone is interested in hearing (or reading) what I have to say, they can. If
<br>
not, they can use the delete key. I wasn't interested in converting or
<br>
enlightening anyone--I was just putting in my 2 cents.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'll grant you that there is one metrics according to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your means of expression might have looked like a win:
</em><br>
<p>I'm definitely not interesting in a &quot;win.&quot; How boring and archaic.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; it might originally have took you less time to think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and write your message in this incorrect form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it would have in its correct form.
</em><br>
<p>In conversation there is no correct or incorrect form. Conversation is
<br>
self-expression. If I were engaged in a debate or were writing a scientific
<br>
paper, this might apply, but not in this case. Of course, one person's &quot;correct&quot;
<br>
may not be another's. This seems highly subjective and is uninteresting to me.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But as you can see, this time you thought you won,
</em><br>
<p>Since I never claimed to have &quot;won&quot; anything, and since I have now stated that I
<br>
have no interest in winning, your statement is nonsensical. If this is the
<br>
perspective you operate from, fine. Please don't attempt to apply it to me. It's
<br>
a waste of everyone's time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; was first lost by other people trying to decode what you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or being misled by it (loss multiplied by the number of readers),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then by yourself clarifying your position.
</em><br>
<p>Since you're the only person who has complained, this argument is specious.
<br>
Again, if you don't like my post, please delete it. I do it all the time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Either in a specifically altruistic point of view, or in a specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egoistic point of view, in all practicality, your choice was thus wrong.
</em><br>
<p>My choice was my choice. Right and wrong don't enter into it. This is ludicrous.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; So you think you're intelligent? prove it! I don't believe you, so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In intelligent discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This looks like one, after all. Thanks for it.
</em><br>
<p>You're welcome, I suppose. To me this has now become a waste of time and is
<br>
boring. It appears our needs are different, as well as our styles.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; (as opposed to unprovoked attacks),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think the attack was unprovoked.
</em><br>
<p>Any reasonable person would likely disagree with you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And I don't think that attacks, even unprovoked,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose intelligent discussions.
</em><br>
<p>I think that attacking is a useless and unproductive way to discuss anything, and
<br>
reveals an immaturity on the part of the attacker. I can speak from personal
<br>
experience on this one.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; [...] this response would be referred to as ad hominem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was undeniably ad hominem, but note that it was not argumentum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you a lot for taking up the challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and making your post level higher.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Now*, I believe you.
</em><br>
<p>Well, goody for you. I'm glad I have finally risen to your high level. (This is
<br>
sarcasm, which is a form of hostility.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; It's a weak strategy, is uncalled for in this case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and totally destroys your credibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I apparently participated in a working overall,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think it was uncalled for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it's a risk I'm taking (though maybe lightly so).
</em><br>
<p>Whatever. It's your life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps in the future you might consider taking a deep breath before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for reminding me. I'll try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll return the argument to you:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I should take time to be less aggressive in my replies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should take time to be more precise in yours.
</em><br>
<p>An interesting proposal, but unworthy of consideration. Aggression and
<br>
lack-of-precision are not equitable. Aggression is destructive (entropic) and
<br>
harmful, while lack-of-precision (at least in this case) is, at worst, ignorable.
<br>
So, please, feel free to ignore it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; There's a difference between &quot;responsible for&quot; (in charge of,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which is what I meant) and &quot;responsible to&quot; (an obligation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never seen the term &quot;responsible to&quot;, so I'm not sure what you mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you expand?
</em><br>
<p>I'm responsible to my boss (have to do what he says, have to show up at
<br>
prescribed times, must perform work), to the government (don't like this one, but
<br>
must pay taxes, must obey laws, etc.), to my family (I like this one, but must
<br>
help provide for, must spend time with). These are all obligations of various
<br>
types, which could be shirked if I chose to (with varying consequences). I'm not
<br>
really an expert on this, so you may want to explore this on your own. I'm simply
<br>
speaking from personal experience.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Maybe you're trying to talk about intelligent handling of responsibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which, in the context of justifying intelligent choice about the future,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is but a hidden tautology (which is, of course, true).
</em><br>
<p>Okay. Sure. Whatever. (Yawn.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Then to use your terms, I invite you to be &quot;responsible for&quot; your posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not just &quot;responsible to&quot; them. (Doesn't sound right.)
</em><br>
<p>You have it reversed. I am &quot;responsible for&quot; what I post here because it is
<br>
something I am in charge of. No one else is doing it for me, and my posts won't
<br>
appear here unless I do them. Maybe this is colloquial use of the word that is
<br>
unfamiliar to you. Since it is part of my conversational vocabulary, and since
<br>
I'm not a linguist, I really don't know. (Can anyone help with this?) Since I
<br>
have no obligation to post here, the &quot;responsible to&quot; term doesn't apply. If
<br>
you're suggesting that I am somehow obligated to construct my responses in such a
<br>
way that is agreeable to you or anyone else, then I will have to disagree with
<br>
you. Again, this is what the delete key is for. Since I'm not interested in
<br>
converting or convincing you or anyone else of anything I say, then this is
<br>
doubly obvious. If you don't like it, don't read it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see how it could be anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;natural&quot; for us to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Remove your quotes, and consider how &quot;do so&quot; is generic in your sentence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Then you'll have reached the tautology. Now, move on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This makes no sense to me. Again, I think you're arguing against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something that isn't there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not all arguing is &quot;against&quot;. Don't let my questioning your own personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence let you polarize the debate in terms of &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was putting your argument in perspective, and showing how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the specifics to which you apply them are irrelevant to its purpose,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus factorizing your argument.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm. Okay.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; [I] was using [this phrase] in a conversational manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I wasn't trying to make any particular point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly what I'm reproaching you: noise.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is what the delete key is for.
