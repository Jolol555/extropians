<p>You're quite wrong.  I dare say that both a remarkable number
<br>
of cryonicists and extropians do not concede the necessity of
<br>
mortality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...the maths alone says we must come a cropper some time before

</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  If persons now living do manage to get past the
<br>
next couple of centuries, nothing prevents them from establishing
<br>
numerous copies of themselves throughout the universe, and the
<br>
chance of them all being taken out, in say a gamma burst, is
<br>
quite small.  And some folks, such as Freeman Dyson, have been
<br>
talking a long time about physics that might support an infinite
<br>
amount of computation.  The ultimate source for these
<br>
considerations is Tipler, &quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot;.

<em>&gt; [That's more like it!]  I am not limited to my personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Whatever...]   I do not necessarily believe that even my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of that most intimate of conglomerate illusions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I&quot;, is invariant or deserving of being preserved indefinitely...
</em><br>
<p>It may or may not be invariant, but that has little to do
<br>
with it &quot;deserving&quot; to be preserved.  Does an obscure type
<br>
of ant in the Amazon jungle &quot;deserve&quot; to have its pattern
<br>
recorded for all time?  Most people today would say yes.
<br>
Well, I'd say that the pattern of Samantha Atkins is about
<br>
10^7 times as important to preserve.  Where the hell does
<br>
this concept of &quot;deserve&quot; come from anyway?  It almost 
<br>
sounds as though one's &quot;worthiness&quot; were being evaluated
<br>
by the Almighty, or by some similarly transcended creature
<br>
(perhaps the AI you're working on).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I&quot; over time would change in ways that would seem very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;not-I&quot; today. Even this concept of &quot;me&quot; as distinct from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;others&quot; in quite this way is open to change and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modification given time enough.
</em><br>
<p>But watch out.  If you evolve into something that on objective
<br>
grounds is not-Samantha, then unless you've arranged that
<br>
earlier versions of you get ample run time, you'll be quite
<br>
dead.  Please don't let that happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I want that time and the opportunity to witness all of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes and much more.  It is not death so much that I seek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to avoid but the end of becoming and being.  I am not done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that and don't plan to be done.
</em><br>
<p>That's more like it!  Well said at last.
