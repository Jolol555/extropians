<em>&gt;From: Natasha Vita-More &lt;<a href="mailto:natasha@natasha.cc?Subject=Re:%20BIOTECH:%20Farners%20are%20not%20shunning%20biotech%20this%20season&In-Reply-To=&lt;200105011444.HAA10232@well.com&gt;">natasha@natasha.cc</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;With better testing and more discussion, farmers will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decide for themselves if they want to farm with genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modified crops.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;In another article I read today, &quot;Genetically Altered Foods are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Key to Feeding Increasingly Hungry World&quot; (August 27, 2000,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Op-ed By Richard Berman) --  a couple of quotes of rational.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially liked the statement about &quot;The organic crusade finds an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;audience in a movement that sees natural farming as one step on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the road back to Eden.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;The plain truth, quoting FDA Commissioner Jane Henney, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'biotech products have produced no evidence of food safety risks:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not one rash, not one sore throat, not one headache.' That is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a claim that organic foods, which often eschew such fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;safety steps as pasteurization, can match. &quot;
</em><br>
<p>I'm wondering if there are problems that have not been recognized
<br>
yet, in fact I have a candidate, GERD. I had never even heard of it
<br>
a few years ago (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease) and am
<br>
surrounded by people who seem to be diagnosed with it on a regular
<br>
basis. I know dozens of people on medication for it.
<br>
<p>I've had every test you can imagine, and they can't find a cause.
<br>
Since it's not immediately life threatening, and is controllable
<br>
with medication/diet/exercise there doesn't seem to be a rush to
<br>
find an answer. Yet there is an &quot;outbreak&quot; in the growing number of
<br>
new cases, and this just in the last couple of years.
<br>
<p>Guess what else's new in the last couple of years?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;How then is the organic-foods industry able to put this new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exciting agricultural technology under a cloud? Part of the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the tendency of many Americans to cling to romantic ideals. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organic crusade finds an audience in a movement that sees natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;farming as one step on the road back to Eden. Chefs Collaboratives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;founding organization, Oldways, for instance, speaks of looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back for dietary lessons that would help humanity weave a seamless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;web of agriculture, behavior, history, tradition, culture, health,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;finance, politics . . . '  Or as Chefs Collaborative board member
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Judy Wicks puts it, 'We like to say we use good food to lure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innocent customers into social activism.'&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://www.guestchoice.com/oped19.htm">http://www.guestchoice.com/oped19.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>I think this is just the continuation of a healthy lifestyles
<br>
movement. The trend for a long time has been the freshest food,
<br>
prepared simply, with the best taste, highest nutrition, lowest
<br>
calories possible.
<br>
<p>The biotech industry would be wise to follow this trend.
<br>
<p>I see this as a good thing.
