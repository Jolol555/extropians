</em><br>
<p>Amen to that too. I think the main reason we do not have a serious
<br>
ethics debate about (say) genetic enhancement is that we do not have a
<br>
value system start from. Transhumanism as a whole lacks a strong value
<br>
basis; subsets can of course have it. I think that a
<br>
humanist-libertarian transhumanism would be a very powerful framework
<br>
for an ethical discourse, but then we have to accept that plenty of self
<br>
professed transhumanists will disagree strongly with the ethical
<br>
foundations of that subset. But it is better to have a few well thought
<br>
out transhumanist ethical systems rather than a diffuse anything goes.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; The exit strategy doesn't work. Where are all the top notch researchers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How many great researchers can you attract with promises of freedom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when they might get prosecuted if they return home, when investors dare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not invest because they will be tainted in the media by association with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;evil&quot; and possibly even get hit by bills forbidding investing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unethical overseas research? Sure, you will likely get some heroes, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the modern scientific/technological enterprise does not work that way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To get somewhere, we need a lively open scientific discourse, competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labs, investors and the economic power of being part of the global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the exit strategy can work.  It has certainly worked at many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points in history.  I don't believe that today is so utterly different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to make it totally unworkable.
</em><br>
<p>Any examples involving high tech industries? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Why not have the researchers and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors and everyone else concerned all move to where they are freest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pursue their dreams?  Let those who cannot or will not follow stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home in the world they vote into existence if it is incompatible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the creation of the future.  
</em><br>
<p>Why have not George Soros, Bill Gates and leading biotechnologists all
<br>
moved to Cayman Islands? Because it would cost them far too much. They
<br>
are in a way freest to pursue their dreams in the US, despite all its
<br>
repression, because that is where the money, networks and research
<br>
institutions are. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a dilemna here.  On the one hand freedom from government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shackles and freedom from the will of the uninformed and partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uneducable masses is essential to progress with the work.  On the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand the work utterly transforms the lives of everyone.  To what extent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do we have the right and even the obligation to choose for humanity? 
</em><br>
<p>We are not choosing for humanity, we are choosing for ourselves and
<br>
hence giving others new possible choices. There is no right to be
<br>
shielded from new choices. To limit individual freedom of thinking in
<br>
the name of the abstraction &quot;humanity&quot; is a great injustice.
