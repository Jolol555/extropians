<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have known about this project for some time through Bill Faloon and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sources.  It will indeed be a legitimate enterprise and I wish Bill, Saul
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the others involved the best of fortunes with it.  Personally, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse --I am optimistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the future of cryonics, but for a building with a 10,000 patient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capacity, I am not so certain whether or not now is the best time to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a project. Still, I am also aware that the effective creation of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facility of this size should add a lot of credibility to the field of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryonics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since the timeframe for TimeShip to be operating is about six years away, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is possible that given enough marketing, cryonics will be palatable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough people that the facility will be useful and even necessary.  It is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however, a bit of a leap of faith, and one which I hope is effective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the meantime, it is my hope that more people become willing to do more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the field of cryonics than is currently being done.  The best way to ensure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that TimeShip launches effectively is to help lay the groundwork.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, I don't understand why the people who run cryonics organizations 
<br>
make the decisions they do.  E.g., Alcor has no money budgeted for remote 
<br>
standbys, yet it's trying to raise $200,000 for &quot;marketing.&quot;
<br>
<p>This Timeship scheme reminds me of a &quot;new country&quot; project a young 
<br>
libertarian brainiac in cryonics was plugging in the early 1990's.  He 
<br>
wasted a lot of cryonicists' time with it, yet it went nowhere.  I'd rather 
<br>
that cryonics organizations concentrate on (a) staying financially solid, 
<br>
and (b) improving the biomedical credibility of the procedure through 
<br>
vitrification research and better response capabilities for members who 
<br>
deanimate suddenly.  The cryonics bunker realistically shouldn't be 
<br>
considered all that urgent until the basic technological problems in 
<br>
stabilizing human brains have been solved.
