I guess I am an extropian, but I think I am much more pessimistic
<br>
than most as of the you people on the list seem to be as for
<br>
the timing for the Singularity, or the transition to posthumanism.
<br>
<p>At times, your predictions sound a bit like
<br>
the ones from various millenarist christian sectarians
<br>
who enjoin to &quot;Repent, for the End of the World is near&quot;.
<br>
Except that you're optimistic and physicalist
<br>
rather than pessimistic and metaphysicalist
<br>
about the nature of the nearby catastrophic event.
<br>
But somehow, I doubt we're to see this Singularity,
<br>
the end of such a transition, or anything like immortality
<br>
achieved in our lifetime.
<br>
<p>For one thing, about the timing before some AI emerges (if it ever does),
<br>
I don't think that AI is possible least there is already
<br>
the well-developed equivalent of what TUNES (or Flare?) should be
<br>
to serve as a proper autocatalytic development platform.
<br>
For another thing about phase transition:
<br>
I believe that from the large body of historical data we have,
<br>
we're already in one, but one that,
<br>
albeit it seems instantaneous in geological times,
<br>
is very long in individual human life time,
<br>
and there's no reason to believe we're at the end of it.
<br>
Of course, the best (or rather, the only) way
<br>
to successfully predict such future is to make it happen.
<br>
So you're welcome to prove me wrong.
<br>
Meanwhile, my ambitions (TUNES) are much in retreat of the great changes
<br>
you're looking for, although I'm convinced their success
<br>
can be instrumental in making these changes come sooner
<br>
(which I still don't expect to be soon).
<br>
<p>Yours freely,
<br>

<br>
Don't worry about what anybody else is going to do. The best way to predict
<br>
the future is to invent it. Really smart people with reasonable funding can
<br>
do just about anything that doesn't violate too many of Newton's Laws!
