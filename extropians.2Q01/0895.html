<p><em>&gt;For those of you who are unaware, the answers to the question of &quot;why do

</em><br>
<p>I go off like an alarm clock every time I see this. I agree that
<br>
antagonistic pleiotropy is the principle answer (animals that foresake
<br>
later benefits for earlier ones survive better and procreate more reliably,
<br>
if only because predators and accidents get you sooner or later even if
<br>
you're in tip-top well-maintained shape).
<br>
<p>But the `declining force of natural selection'? What *is* this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Why does evolution let us die, uncle Robert? Why should a cooperating
<br>
bunch of genes allow themselves to be thrown away just because the bodies
<br>
they've built, and run, wear out? Shouldn't a few of them stumble on
<br>
enhanced maintenance mechanisms like the ones that keep germ lines nice and
<br>
clean?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, you might think so in your youthful ignorance, you young lout, but
<br>
don't forget that evolution only works by passing down genes to the next
<br>
generation.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What?? You're begging the question. If you stay alive and keep having
<br>
offspring, you're *one* of the next generation.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;No, see, once you've matured sufficiently to produce the first litter,
<br>
selection starts to discard you and focus on the kids.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Why the hell should it? I mean, here I am, an immortal, fit as the day I
<br>
passed my maturity exams, and full of the guile and cunning of experience!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;No, no, you're *old* and *used* now--your body is wearing out, while the
<br>
youngsters are scampering about, fit as fiddles.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;AAARRGHH. You're doing it again--begging the very question we started
<br>
with! Your body is only wearing out if you've let your repair mechanisms
<br>
run down. Why not maintain them?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Because-- Um. Erm, there are now a huge dispersed number of copies of the
<br>
genome in your body's trillions of cells, all with different portions
<br>
masked or activated differentially. It's not as easy as maintaining the
<br>
integrity of an ovum or sperm.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I can believe that. But how do you *know* the cost-benefit profile works
<br>
out to the disadvantage of long-term maintenance? Maybe that's never been
<br>
tried, because the bad critters always eat you first.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That sounds mildly plausible. But don't forget that a lot of those bad
<br>
critters are living *inside your poor suffering bod*! Bacteria, viruses,
<br>
prions--&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Revolting. Hey, what side of the argument am I meant to be taking?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I can't remember. It's weird, this is just like talking to myself. You're
<br>
not-- Oh my god, you're not--&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;A renovated clone, yes. Sorry, uncle. Or is that nephew?&quot;
