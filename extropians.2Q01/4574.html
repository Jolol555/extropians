<p><em>&gt; Bamboo actually grows *quite* fast.  I think it can reach 3-4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  meter heights in a month or two.  The question you have to ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is *why* are the doubling times that long?  Is it an energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  limitation?  Is it an essential nutrient limitation?  Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a water limitation?  etc.  One of the things that humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  good at is mass-transport.  Figure out what the limiting elements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are in the growth equation and supply them in sufficient abundance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to work around the problem.  
</em><br>
<p>As has been calculated on this list in discussions of alcohol-driven
<br>
cars, the fundamental limitation is energy.  There are nutrient
<br>
limitation but we can generally deal with those.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You could even connect your natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  gas pipeline to a conversion unit that pumped out ATP in abundance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for the house-seeds so they can grow in the dark!  Yes, I know it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  makes it more expensive, but presumably after your house is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  finished growing, it can manufacture natural gas and pump
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it back into the pipeline, so you only need a short term loan.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, making a plant into a methane oxidizer has
<br>
efficiency potential.  There's the CO2 problem,
<br>
of course.  Theoretically you could hook up 
<br>
the transmembrane potential in mitochondria/
<br>
chloroplasts/various bacteria to electrical 
<br>
wiring; that would improve energy efficiency
<br>
3-fold or so.  However, that's quite a tough
<br>
problem in cell biology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And of course the Arabadopsis genome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;begins to lay the foundation for understanding plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structure.  You can bet that the seed companies are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to *love* growing the corn *without* the stalks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm fairly confident we will get fairly fine structural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with *that* statement.  I just don't think it's anything
<br>
like imminent.  Knowing the sequence doesn't tell us the
<br>
function; that requires a lot of difficult greenhouse/wet bench
<br>
work.  Dissecting the function of a gene requires often
<br>
dozens of person-years; 30,000 genes at 10 person-years
<br>
each is 300,000 person-years.  Figure $100,000/person-year 
<br>
and that's 30 billion dollars.  Then we need to figure out how
<br>
to modify.  It'll be a while.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I doubt you could fit a house-seed genome in a megabase.  Its probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least the complexity of a bamboo genome which even in compressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;form is probably between a 100 Mbp and 1 Gbp.   I was however *careful*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about how I phrased the bet -- I said &quot;manufacturing cost&quot; and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;design cost&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>Manufacturing and design costs are hard to separate for engineered
<br>
organisms.  What exactly do you count in manufacturing?  More than
<br>
just fermentation costs, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ah Eugene, you have to work *across* technologies as well as in depth!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You use external site-management lasers driven by the blueprint that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interact with highly specific photoantenna complexes within the cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that in turn are tied to the signal transduction pathways for &quot;divide&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or &quot;commit apoptosis&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That should allow you to control the shape of your new house to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within 10-20 micron accuracy -- much better than human workers!
</em><br>
<p>*that* was to me, not Eugene (the rest *was* Eugene).  When you
<br>
have to surround the nascent house with micron-accuracy lasers
<br>
I think you still have a costly procedure - ignoring the costs of
<br>
designing the communication system into the organism.  I agree
<br>
you could have a plant where certain frequencies would trigger
<br>
apoptosis within 10 years.
