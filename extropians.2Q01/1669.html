<br>
<p>Association of silicofluoride treated water with elevated blood lead.

<p>[Medline record in process]
<br>
<p>Previous epidemiological studies have associated silicofluoride-
<br>
treated community water with enhanced child blood lead parameters.
<br>
Chronic, low-level dosage of silicofluoride (SiF) has never been
<br>
adequately tested for health effects in humans. We report here
<br>
on a statistical study of 151,225 venous blood lead (VBL) tests
<br>
taken from children ages 0-6 inclusive, living in 105 communities
<br>
of populations from 15,000 to 75,000. The tests are part of a
<br>
sample collected by the New York State Department of Children's
<br>
Health, mostly from 1994-1998. Community fluoridation status
<br>
was determined from the CDC 1992 Fluoridation Census. Covariates
<br>
were assigned to each community using the 1990 U.S. Census.
<br>
Blood lead measures were divided into groups based on race and
<br>
age. Logistic regressions were carried out for each race/age
<br>
group, as well as above and below the median of 7 covariates to
<br>
test the relationship between known risk factors for lead uptake,
<br>
exposure to SiF-treated water, and VBL &gt;10 microg/dL. RESULTS:
<br>
For every age/race group, there was a consistently significant
<br>
association of SiF treated community water and elevated blood
<br>
lead. Logistic regressions above and below the median value of
<br>
seven covariates show an effect of silicofluoride on blood lead
<br>
independent of those covariates. The highest likelihood of
<br>
children having VBL&gt; 10 microg/dL occurs when they are both
<br>
exposed to SiF treated water and likely to be subject to another
<br>
risk factor known to be associated with high blood lead (e.g.,
<br>
old housing). Results are consistent with prior analyses of
<br>
surveys of children's blood lead in Massachusetts and NHANES
<br>
III. These data contradict the null hypothesis that there is
<br>
no difference between the toxic effects of SiF and sodium
<br>
fluoride, pointing to the need for chemical studies and
<br>
comprehensive animal testing of water treated with commercial
<br>
grade silicofluorides.
