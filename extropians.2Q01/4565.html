SPACE.COM has this interesting piece:
<br>
<p>&quot;Energia Plans to Offer Two Tourists Seats on Soyuz&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.space.com/spacenews/launchindustry/energia_passenger_seats_010517.html">http://www.space.com/spacenews/launchindustry/energia_passenger_seats_010517.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>This raises an interesting question of precisely how
<br>
expensive a Soyuz launch really is or whether its
<br>
being indirectly subsidized by the government.
<br>
(And do the Soyuz capsules get recycled or are
<br>
they one-offs?)  You have to wonder if they
<br>
could up the seat count if they built the capsules
<br>
out of the best technology available today?
<br>
<p>If you figure 2 people at $20 million a pop, thats
<br>
$40 million -- can the production cost of the rocket
<br>
and launch expenses really be less than that?
<br>
<p>Thats about an order of magnitude less than what a
<br>
shuttle launch costs (though I think they can fit 6
<br>
on the shuttle).
<br>
<p>It now gets interesting, if you view the launch facilities
<br>
as sunk costs (paid for by the taxpayers, satellite launches,
<br>
etc.) are we starting to get to the era where the cost
<br>
of producing and flying the rocket &amp; capsule is affortable
<br>
by perhaps 0.0004% of the people in the first world if
<br>
you fly from the third world?  What is the size of the
<br>
ground control team that you need if you are just
<br>
circling the Earth?
<br>
<p>I think Tito's trip is going to have a big impact as
<br>
a paradigm breaker.
