<em>&gt; Here's the parable.  Suppose you're stuck on a boat in the middle of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; drifting away from the island that you know is to the east.  Suppose you're
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; who can paddle well.  You may be helping the others most by ignoring their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short-term needs (fish) in favor of their longer-term needs (getting to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island).  If you get them to the island, then eventually they'll get to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island with lots of food on it, a much better situation than being on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sinking boat with a slightly full stomach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the other people don't **realize** the boat is drifting in the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction, though, because, they don't realize the island is there, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what?  Then they'll just think you're a bit loopy for paddling so hard.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they know you're a great fisherman, they'll be annoyed at you for not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping them get food....
</em><br>
<p>Except I'm *not* a great fisherman.  I am a far, far better paddler than I
<br>
am a fisherman.  There are *lots* and *lots* of people fishing, and nobody
<br>
paddling.  That is the situation we are currently in.
<br>
<p>What is my answer missing?  Sociality.  Very well, then, let's look at the
<br>
social aspects of this.
<br>
<p>Your answer makes sense for a small boat.  Your answer even scales for a
<br>
hunter-gatherer tribe of 200 people.  But we don't live in a
<br>
hunter-gatherer tribe.  We live in a world with six billion people.  From
<br>
a &quot;logical&quot; perspective, that means that it takes something like AI to get
<br>
the leverage to benefit that many people.  From a &quot;social&quot; perspective, it
<br>
means that at least some of those people will always be ticked off, and
<br>
hopefully some of them will sign on.
<br>
<p>Plans can be divided into three types.  There are plans like Bill Joy's,
<br>
that work only if everyone on the planet signs on, and which get hosed if
<br>
even 1% disagree.  Such plans are unworkable.  There are plans like the
<br>
thirteen colonies' War for Independence, which work only if a *lot* of
<br>
people - i.e., 30% or 70% or whatever - sign on.  Such plans require
<br>
tremendous effort, and pre-existing momentum, to build up to the requisite
<br>
number of people.
<br>
<p>And there are plans like building a seed AI, which require only a finite
<br>
number of people to sign on, but which benefit the whole world.  The third
<br>
class of plan requires only that a majority *not* get ticked off enough to
<br>
shut you down, which is a more achievable goal than proselytizing a
<br>
majority of the entire planet.
<br>
<p>Plans of the third type are far less tenuous than plans of the second
<br>
type.
<br>
<p>And the fact is that a majority of the world isn't about to knock on my
<br>
door and complain that I'm doing all this useless paddling instead of
<br>
fishing.  The fall-off-the-edge-of-the-world types might knock and
<br>
complain about my *evil* paddling, but *no way* is a *majority* going to
<br>
complain about my paddling instead of fishing.  Certainly not here in the
<br>
US, where going your own way is a well-established tradition, and most
<br>
people are justifiably impressed if you spend a majority of your time
<br>
doing *anything* for the public benefit.
<br>
<p>As Brian Atkins said:
<br>
<p>&quot;The moral of the story, when it comes to actually having a large effect
<br>
on
<br>
the world: the more advanced technology you have access to, the more
<br>
likely
<br>
that the &quot;lone crusader&quot; approach makes more sense to take compared to the
<br>
traditional &quot;start a whole movement&quot; path. Advanced technologies like AI
<br>
give huge power to the individual/small org, and it is an utter waste of
<br>
time (and lives per day) to miss this fact.&quot;
