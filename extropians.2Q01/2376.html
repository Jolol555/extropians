<br>
<em>&gt; The original point of what I was trying to say is that somebody needs to
</em><br>
consider what's going to happen and try to take preventative measures to
<br>
prevent or at least hinder the abuse of &quot;btl&quot; or whatever negative effects
<br>
neuroscience technologies would have.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Don't know if you've noticed it or not, but &quot;btl&quot; doesn't make sense, because
<br>
if something is &quot;better than life&quot; then there's no reason not to go with it,
<br>
and if there's reason *not* to go with it, then it's not &quot;better than life.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I am not trying to equate all neuroscience technology with drug use.  I
</em><br>
believe alot of it would be very positive.  There are many occasions when I
<br>
wish I had a math processor integrated into my brain, for example. It'd be
<br>
much nicer than having to do extended and time-consuming mental math or
<br>
punching in things on a calculator.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That depends on if it would make you a highly-paid math whiz who loves the job
<br>
you do, or a high-priced bio-computer that employers treat as a piece of
<br>
office equipment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    I really don't buy the idea that Social support nets create the very
</em><br>
problems that try to stop.  Those problems were already there, it's just that
<br>
nobody was paying attention to them, they were ignored or brushed under the
<br>
carpet.  Yes, it's true that everybody and thier dog will jump on somethig
<br>
like that, to make money off it, but that doesn't change the fact that it's
<br>
something that needs to be dealt with.  We live in a commerical culture,
<br>
everythign has become commercialized, even science.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Right, that's why (private) commercial drug-rehabilitation facilities do well
<br>
in the US. And that's also why we don't need yet another layer of bueaucrat
<br>
ineptitude fouling things up. IMO, too much government is precisely what
<br>
drives many people to drugs and alcohol to begin with. Note that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    I think that trying to apply Darwinian logic to things *other* than
</em><br>
biological evolution is a dangerous thing.  Apply it to social and cultural
<br>
themes, and you get results like Hitler, for example.  Apply it to ideas, like
<br>
you've done, and some people will buy into the notion that because an idea is
<br>
popular, and stays that way longer, that it's a better idea.  This isn't the
<br>
case at all, it just means that it's a thought that requires little effort and
<br>
appeals to a majority of people.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think that the application of Darwinian logic to evolvable machines is
<br>
entirely appropriate (in fact, indispensable) and even more so when it comes
<br>
to understanding (and creating) non-biological complex adaptive systems.
<br>
Evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics are two very productive fields
<br>
of science. Using Hitler to vilify a branch of science is precisely the kind
<br>
of technique that &quot;requires little effort and appeals to a majority of
<br>
people.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, what do you think about memetics?
<br>
<p>ô¿ô
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
