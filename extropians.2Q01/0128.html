<em>&gt; I am completely appalled by image on TV of TALIBAN muslims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying the immense ancient Buddha statues. This vandalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is inexcusable, and shows the bigotry and bankruptcy of the ideology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of primitive human-era Islam which drives them.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't be so hard on them, Steve. After all, they probably know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing about MVT.
</em><br>
<p>Even without the undoubted benefits of MVT, the Taliban Muslims
<br>
should have enough common sense to avoid these wilder episodes
<br>
of religious lunacy. It takes a great deal of energy to maintain
<br>
the hypnotic delusion of religious beliefs ... endless chanting, 
<br>
candle-lighting and fasting or whatever. What a pity the collective
<br>
energy of great masses of humanoids are wasted in such a fashion.

<p><em>&gt;The writing is on the wall for religion; eventually it will be reduced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something like Zen Buddhism, a set of rituals practiced for the peace of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind they bring.  Unless, of course, some religion turns out to be true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and God, or Allah, or whoever, steps in to protect his faithful and smite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the unbelievers.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeed. The basis of old testament claims are exactly that
<br>
the Jehovah deity can make torches automatically light, whilst
<br>
the priest of competing deity, Baal, fails to provide ignition.
<br>
<p>Today's false priesthoods should be set their own biblical tests.
<br>
<p>What a rabble of money-grabbing fraudsters they are ...... they
<br>
fail any test of rationality or of providing a single shred of evidence
<br>
for their far-fetched claims ... yet 1,000s of men in skirts and funny
<br>
hats make a comfortable living fleecing their gullible flocks.
<br>
<p>As I have said before, it is a scandal that such poisonous nonsense
<br>
is taught to modern schoolkids in state-funded &quot;educational&quot; 
<br>
institutions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Without such intervention, science will kill religion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Given this reality, conflict is inevitable.
</em><br>
<p>But not physical conflict I hope ... and any intellectual
<br>
conflict is a foregone conclusion, supernaturalist ideas
<br>
are wish-full thinking only, with no substance.
<br>
<p>Which leaves only the &quot;propaganda&quot; arena, which is where
<br>
we should be more prepared to challenge the human-been
<br>
religious belief systems. I am doing my bit (and more) by
<br>
getting MVT film and philosophy CDROM encyclopaedias 
<br>
onto exam reading lists and into schools, plus getting MVT 
<br>
as much media coverage as I can. Surely the onus is on
<br>
more of us to put the anti-supernaturalist (rational) case,
<br>
since we can be sure that devote religious zealots will be
<br>
shouting their idiocy at the top of their voices across the land.

MVT ... opening the collective &quot;primal&quot; median eye
