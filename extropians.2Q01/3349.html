<em>&gt; 	in a sense, i guess foreign testbeds are simpler in that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less existing infrastructure that get in the way of change. we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could sponsor a school with less fear of being sued. we could equip a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; village to become self-sufficient without too much capital up-front.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but from past discussions, i do recall the issue of corrupt local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thugs/warlords/governments, etc. i have no idea on whether and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what extent this would be an obstacle though.
</em><br>
<p>There are places where this is not an obstacle, for sure
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	finally, all this hinges on our ability to organize and raise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds. of course, it is a lot more difficult to organize in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absense of a concrete cause. so maybe we should draw up a list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential ventures first.
</em><br>
<p>I think that the best project would be one that both helped the unfortunate
<br>
AND furthered the transhumanist cause.
<br>
<p>My suggestion would be this.  Pick a location in an impoverished nation.
<br>
Then, create an educational facility there that, in addition to providing
<br>
general education, trains people to do things useful for the transhumanist
<br>
cause.  Then employ the people who have graduated from this educational
<br>
facility in the various businesses that we all are involved in.
<br>
<p>For instance, to take the most obvious example, we could create a computer
<br>
science training institute somewhere where there isn't any -- maybe where
<br>
there are hardly any computers -- and then employ its students as
<br>
long-distance interns, and its graduates as long-distance professionals.
<br>
<p>I don't delude myself that doing this sort of thing is EASY.  By no means.
<br>
I don't personally have the time to drive such an effort, though I would
<br>
visit there and teach occasionally, and teach online frequently, for free.
<br>
But if someone who loves both transhumanism and education would like to
<br>
spearhead such a thing, I think the transhumanist community would
<br>
participate avidly, and that this would be a great thing for our public
<br>
image, as well as for our &quot;souls.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't consider this any more of a &quot;deviation from the true path&quot; than
<br>
taking a day off to play with my kids.  (Gee, haven't done that for a while
<br>
;p  -- maybe tomorrow...).   It's important that the people who do create
<br>
the next phase of reality are psychologically reasonably-well-balanced, and
<br>
service to others is one way to help move toward psychological balance...
<br>
just like playing frisbee instead of writing AI code now and then...
