</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in many cases it is justified, because it enables them to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of insufficient data, etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in some cases, like this, they start reading into situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocols that aren't needed to answer the question.  In this case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you say, they demand a &quot;do&quot; (and then have to conjure up what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could reasonably cause the &quot;do&quot;).  Staying with *could*, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand---which mathematicians apparently are more prone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do---obviates further assumptions.  One simply considers sets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and subsets, and so on, and defines probability accordingly.
</em><br>
<p>Which is all fine and good except when it gives you the WRONG ANSWER.  In
<br>
this case, &quot;could&quot; may be more convenient (why?) but it is still the wrong
<br>
way to define the mathematical problem given the word problem.  Our entire
<br>
real world consists of &quot;did&quot;, not &quot;could&quot;.  &quot;Could&quot; is the rational
<br>
construct; &quot;did&quot; is the observed reality.  If you want to pose a
<br>
mathematical problem, you should use a pure mathematical language, or a
<br>
word problem with no flexibility in the priors.  To put it another way,
<br>
Bayesian probabilities automatically govern all problems that are posed in
<br>
real-world language, and if you want to pose a purely mathematical
<br>
question in that language, you need to eliminate any Bayesian
<br>
ambiguities.  If you don't, then somebody who gives a &quot;common-sense but
<br>
wrong answer&quot; that is actually correct gets to gloat over you instead of
<br>
vice versa.
