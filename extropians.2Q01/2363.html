Ok... that's like saying &quot;Let them buy thier crack, eventually, they'll die off because of it, and the world will be better for it.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It strikes me as a rather socially irresponsible view.  They *dont* die off.  Drug addicts today, and simsense addicts tommrow, always have a stead suppply of new converts, and the rest of society suffers for it.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further I happen to believe that people have intrinsic value in themselves.  Letting them deal with the consequences of thier actions is one thing, but letting them die because they made a few foolish choices is pretty damn jaded.  What, you don't believe in social support nets, and catching somebody when they stumble and fall, rather than just letting them smash thier head on the sidewalk?

&lt;&lt;How do you wean someone off an addiction that makes Heroine look like Cancy
<br>
corn?  How you do convince somebody who's half-starved from lying on the floor
<br>
of his apartment with a Dreamchip active for 2 days that he should stop, eat
<br>
some food, and get back to his life? How do you interdict the BTL industry
<br>
when literally anybody with a computer and some electronic expertise can
<br>
fiddle with a sensory recording until the signal regulators are broke? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It can't be all that bad, Manny. You seem to have been able to tear yourself
<br>
away from &quot;BTL&quot; long enough to complain about it. So people like to play games
<br>
more than they like to do constructive things. Nothing new there, except now
<br>
they have better games. If they can afford to devote large amounts of time to
<br>
it, no problem. If they can't afford to, but do it anyway, reality will
<br>
eventually exact the price for this irresponsible behavior It always does.
<br>
Economic necessity is the best form of interdiction.
