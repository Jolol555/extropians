<em>&gt;From Emilyn:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How so? In what way is life a non-abstract grouping? More importantly, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even clearly defined, and will become harder to pin down as we venture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further into nanotech, and begin to make all kinds of interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-directed &amp; self-replicating greeblies.
</em><br>
<p>These greeblies would be life, but I'd question their sustainability which
<br>
hasn't been proven in the course of several billion years, unlike DNA-based
<br>
ecosystems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When we add a re-entrant iteration to such a complex system as the mind, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes clear that the basis of our decisions as being entirely rooted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology, after a short number of iterations, is meaningless. Although it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technically true that we are still wholy derived from our environment, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no way that, given the biological past of  a being, one could derive Mn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for n greater than some fairly small constant. The system is too dynamic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpredictable. So, in effect, our biology is lost to time.
</em><br>
<p>Our genetic development has been very additive, with complexity rising more
<br>
frequent than decreasing. This is both inefficient, and enabling for reverse
<br>
engineering.
<br>
<p>But I'm unable to understand the significance of your derivation. Retrograde
<br>
analysis is only a cognitive tool to understand why our emotions are such as
<br>
they are. We are not interested in what exactly was happening, we try to
<br>
understand the purpose of emotions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are likely a lot of other examples, and those I've given above are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopelessly crude. The point, however, is that we absolutely can escape our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology. We can even be in control of that process in some important sense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually. Beings who modifiy their mental state to become something new,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will do it purposefully. We would expect that they (we?) will be rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent people... they will not be blind to the dynamic nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, and to the rather tricky topology of the space that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traverse. The whole idea of &quot;self&quot; may come to change it's meaning somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for the better, in my opinion).
</em><br>
<p>I agree that we should consider an escape from our biology in order to gain
<br>
flexibility of living spaces, energy efficiency, etc. But diversity is
<br>
beneficial, and the old lifeforms might be good to keep as a back up.
<br>
<p>But when deciding what is good or bad, it's good to have a purpose or goal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No arguments there. One of the grounding concepts of extropy is dynamism...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one is interested in a centrally controlled sculpting of humanity. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea is yet again that individualism reigns... self modification will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverse, and performed according to the desires of each person upon his or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her own self. Thus, while any individual can choose to risk exploratory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour, or else to shun it, the whole space of self modifying individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will tend to be incredibly diverse and interesting. Without a central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organising factor, it cannot help but be exploratory, and evolutionary as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole, in a pretty fascinating way.
</em><br>
<p>Individualism is an extreme statement, just as groupism is. In reality, two
<br>
individuals have a lot in common, genetically and memetically --- in that sense
<br>
they are instances of the same virtual individual. Progress is impossible
<br>
without increasing the number of winners and decreasing the number of losers.
<br>
But individualism leads to too many petty conflicts. Also, we are not completely
<br>
disjoint: genetically, all DNA-based live entities are relatives, some are
<br>
closer (siblings) than others (cousins). But the objective would be to balance
<br>
the cooperation and competition to maximize the fitness of future generations.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that individualism is excessively risk-averse and wipes out
<br>
diversity too quickly.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aleks
