<em>&gt; As is usual in journalism about social problems, this article confuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;earning more money in wages&quot; with &quot;becoming non-poor.&quot;  Despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bestsellerdom of Stanley and Danko's book, apparently it still hasn't sunk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that being well-paid is a long way from being non-poor.  If you make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $100,000/year in wages but lack sufficient invested savings to supply a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsistence income, then when for whatever reason your wage income stops, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short order you'll become as effectively destitute as the people described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this article. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I strongly agree that there is a disparity between income and net worth; the
<br>
media does a disservice to everyone by frequently equating one with the
<br>
other.  Furthermore, this disparity is encouraged by a government (in the
<br>
U.S., but probably in Europe as well) that stiffly penalizes people who make
<br>
enough to have substantial savings.  These days, every extra penny I make
<br>
between January 1st and April 15th has to be saved to cover the difference
<br>
between what is withheld from my income and what the punitive tax rates
<br>
require me to pay.  Sure, I may still manage to actually save money 6 months
<br>
out of the year, but a moderately high gross income doesn't imply vast
<br>
quantities of net income after taxes and basic living expenses.
<br>
<p>Given this situation, the fraction of the money I earn that I am able to
<br>
save seems to be largely invariant of my actual gross income, despite the
<br>
apparent reality that more-or-less fixed expenses should allow me to save
<br>
more.  Because of this, I don't think it is substantially easier to save
<br>
money with an upper-middle class gross income than it is with a lower-middle
<br>
class gross income.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I've been saying for years that America's &quot;affluence&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really a clever illusion, given the relatively small numbers of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wind up financially independent even after decades of work.
</em><br>
<p><p>Despite my mini-tirade above, eventual financial independence is easily
<br>
within reach of pretty much everyone, except perhaps for people with
<br>
pathological psychological conditions.  The &quot;illusion of affluence&quot; exists
<br>
mostly because it is easier to maintain the illusion of affluence than it is
<br>
to actually *be* affluent.  The biggest problem is finding the discipline to
<br>
build real affluence, and recognizing this at a young enough age that it can
<br>
really make a difference.  Too many people, like my parents, don't start
<br>
thinking about these things until they are in their forties.
