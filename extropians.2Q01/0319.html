</em><br>
<p>Frankly, I don't see what my point has to do with philosophy at all. 
<br>
Whether or not science or religion or faith or testability, et cetera, is
<br>
the ultimate fountain of epistemological validity, et cetera, has nothing
<br>
whatsoever to do with what is happening on this planet.  The scientists
<br>
have one psychology, and it is necessarily explicable in terms of basic
<br>
human emotions.  Sophisticated modern theologians have another psychology,
<br>
and the great mass of religious folk, a third.  There is, necessarily,
<br>
nothing mysterious about any of it.  Forget the verbal arguments.  See
<br>
with your heart.  Look at the way the people act.
<br>
<p>The scientists live in a put-up-or-shut-up culture where people bet their
<br>
beliefs on every experiment, and they dislike &quot;faith&quot; because it seems
<br>
like an excuse to welsh on the bets.  There is also, nontrivially, a
<br>
culture that has grown up around the Tao of science, and it is opposed to
<br>
the culture that has grown up around religion, not least because religion
<br>
attacked first and humans instinctively polarize themselves into groups -
<br>
none of which, of course, has anything to do with actual science or
<br>
religion; it's just tribes of humans beating up on each other.  The
<br>
scientiic community may not have started that vicious game, but now that
<br>
they're winning a few of them are adopting the offensive, even if it's not
<br>
socially acceptable.
<br>
<p>The theologians are running scared, on the defensive in every way, but
<br>
they can't possibly admit that to themselves, since it's not consistent
<br>
with their pride or their belief systems.  So they turn their weaknesses
<br>
into allegations of mystery.  From their repeated losses in tests of
<br>
truth, they construct allegations that their truths are untestable.  These
<br>
allegations are inconsistent with the innate human picture of religion and
<br>
recorded religious accounts (whether historical or fictional is
<br>
*irrelevant* to this point).  Thus, they cannot have arisen from any Tao
<br>
of *true* supernaturalism.  Whether theurgy is real or simply imaginative
<br>
fiction, theology today is not theurgy; it is an edifice built on
<br>
generalizing from excuses for past failures.
<br>
<p>What this world needs is the Alliance for Confident Religion, a collection
<br>
of atheists and fundamentalists who are at least willing to concede that
<br>
religion is either blatantly true or blatantly false, but who both agree
<br>
that calling it untestable is in blatant, cowardly, blasphemous
<br>
contradiction of every religious scripture.  Two things this world does
<br>
*not* need are atheists masquerading as theologians and superstitious
<br>
pseudo-piety masquerading as atheism.
