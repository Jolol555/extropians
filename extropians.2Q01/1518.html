<p>I'm betting on bio &amp; computer science to beat any of these; I think
<br>
biological and intensive computional methods will beat out so-called
<br>
intelligent design, to all the big stuff. Of course, these methods will be
<br>
extremely intelligently designed in themselves, and the direction of humans
<br>
in the process will be vital, up to the point where gaussians become
<br>
obsolete.
<br>
<p>Much of my justification for this point of view is that we have a big push
<br>
in the biotech area now, which doesn't look likely to abate soon. This
<br>
emerging field is necessarily computationally intensive; see this fluffy NYT
<br>
article, which talks about the fact that biology is using the most computer
<br>
time at the moment of all the sciences:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/weekinreview/25JOHN.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/weekinreview/25JOHN.html</a>
<br>
<p>Top quote from the article:
<br>
&quot;If I were 21 years old, I probably wouldn't go into computing. The
<br>
computing industry is about to become boring. I'd go into genetic
<br>
engineering.&quot; - Larry Ellison
<br>
<p>Major computational resources, the smarts to use them, biotech
<br>
(cough*nanotech*cough) and a LOT of dollars will combine into something
<br>
which I think will beat the cognitive science approach to AI/IA/etc. We are
<br>
going to get the aeroplane before the bird. And, it sure as hell is not
<br>
going to be hand coded, although the systems that generate the systems that
<br>
generate it may be, maybe.
