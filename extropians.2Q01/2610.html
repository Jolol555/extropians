<br>
<p>&quot;You can't take a totally alienating technology and use it for anything
<br>
except more alienation, more destructive impact on every level from the
<br>
psyche to the rest of the biosphere.&quot;
<br>
<p>It all comes down to alienation, doesn't it?  Technology must be rejected,
<br>
the division of labor must be rejected, because they alienate people.  The
<br>
cardiologist will never know what it's like to grow his own food; hell, he
<br>
might hardly ever get out of the city, and the closest thing to a farm he
<br>
sees might be Central Park.  Never mind that he is able to save the lives
<br>
of a few hundred people, who do a few hundred different things for
<br>
different people who eventually do things for the farmer, and for this the
<br>
farmer helps feed people who eventually help the doctor.  All this is too
<br>
alienating.  Hell, we can't even see what's going on.
<br>
<p>I might say that such a process occurs much better under this mysterious
<br>
alienating system called the market, than could exist in a left-anarchist
<br>
scenario sans &quot;property&quot; (=investment capital).  Except that I don't think
<br>
it could happen without property, because without the information provided
<br>
by market prices, individuals wouldn't know what skills were needed from
<br>
them, let alone far more complex calculations like just how much time and
<br>
effort they should expend to become more educated in their field and then
<br>
whether they should be one of those who, rather than directly working in
<br>
the field, devote themselves to educating new people.  Such a scenario
<br>
should not even be achievable, because long before you get there,
<br>
calculations will be distorted enough to make people's lives so
<br>
comparatively poor that they'll either re-create markets (complete with
<br>
capital expenditures), create a fascist backlash, or experience mass death
<br>
through starvation and other fun causes.
<br>
<p>So, back to alienation.  Nihilism and existentialism haven't gone away, nor
<br>
should they.  They are the most refined reflections upon just what it is to
<br>
be a subjective entity in a beautifully complex (now joylessly ordered, now
<br>
psychotically random) world.  It is hard to be an nihilist, which may
<br>
partly explain the growing anaesthesia of eastern philosophies in the west.
<br>
&nbsp;I believe that Zerzan, like Marx and the left-&quot;anarchists&quot; alike, gets one
<br>
important thing right.  Industrialization, capitalism, the division of
<br>
labor, almost certainly would have led to a growth in alienation, for at
<br>
least three reasons:
<br>
<p>1) that because it brings people to a standard of living far above anything
<br>
that could reasonably be called &quot;subsistence&quot;, their lives are not
<br>
seriously threatened by their devoting time to a search for self-accepted
<br>
meaning, nor by their rejection of some social (religious, ethical) rules,
<br>
which in the past were necessary to make sure noone failed in his
<br>
life-or-death duties.
<br>
<p>2) that the division-of-labor under capitalism allows a large number of
<br>
people, probably most of those who truly want it, to work in areas
<br>
conducive to such a belief system.
<br>
<p>3) that the idea that everything has a price is closely related to the idea
<br>
that nothing is sacred, a pillar of nihilist thought.
<br>
<p>Marx, a consummate anti-nihilist, thought that hard toil to produce one's
<br>
own necessities, by virtue of being an unalienating life, constituted an
<br>
ideal life.  Having been acquainted with left-&quot;anarchists&quot; for quite some
<br>
time (by virtue of our fight to reclaim the A-word for anarcho-capitalism),
<br>
I believe that their fundamental philosophy is the same.  Ignorance of
<br>
economics reinforces and is reinforced by a childish unwillingness to set
<br>
sail in a world much more complex than bare survival.  Or perhaps I insult
<br>
children.
