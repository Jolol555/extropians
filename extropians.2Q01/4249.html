<p><em>&gt;&gt; There's a difference between &quot;responsible for&quot; (in charge of,

</em><br>
<p>I didn't get what you meant by &quot;I'm responsible to&quot;, because you were
<br>
proposing a dilemma between two meanings for &quot;responsible&quot;,
<br>
which once again turned into a false dilemma. These meanings do not oppose.
<br>
Once again I'm responsible to my boss for my work.
<br>
There's no meaning to &quot;in charge of&quot; but that of an obligation of result.
<br>
And an obligation is but the data of some sanction, that will select
<br>
for or against certain behavior patterns.
<br>
<p>As for the role of intelligence in evolution, the ultimate principle behind
<br>
evolution is that individuals are responsibles to their genes and memes
<br>
and soul or whatever for what they do toward their spreadth and survival.
<br>
That's the basis very of natural selection. Any intelligence comes afterward,
<br>
as an emerging pattern that is positively selected. Oh, and that all was
<br>
about the fact that memes are now the preponderant factor for life change,
<br>
as opposed to genes, well, uh, sure. No great news, either, though news that
<br>
deserve more than being drown into lots of fallacious small talk.

<p><em>&gt; Alas, there is only one solution to this quagmire that I know of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When one begins to sense that any word or phrase is causing trouble,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then one simply stops using it, at least for a while.
</em><br>
Better than not using words: use them in context.
<br>
Words are things with dynamic context-dependent meaning,
<br>
but they are used to denote context-independent concepts
<br>
(or rather, concepts that contain their contextual closure).
<br>
When the contextual closure is uncertain or contextual conflict is detected,
<br>
it's possible to build some common context, out of the negociation that any
<br>
rational conversation is. What's wrong is to use the uncertainty so as
<br>
to build fallacies of distraction, ambiguity, or missing the point,
<br>
or whatever.
<br>
<p>[Neal has contended that he was just being conversational and self-expressing.
<br>
So what? I contend that I'm just as much conversational and self-expressing
<br>
as I point out the mistakes I find in his messages.]

No! Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.
