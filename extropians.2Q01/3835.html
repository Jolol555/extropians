</em><br>
<p>Would they? It would seem to depend on how many of
<br>
the machines you would send them, so they would be able
<br>
to break them for analysis, and how much time
<br>
they would have to play with it. Would they have juice,
<br>
at at least know what kind of juice it takes? Handbooks?
<br>
Okay, no handbooks.
<br>
<p>Assuming they were motivated, what they probably would be,
<br>
if you tell them the device is basic part of economy's
<br>
infrastructure, and a valuable scientific instrument on
<br>
its own right. The mechanical parts and the macroscopic 
<br>
stuff would be comparatively easy to figure out. Keyboard?
<br>
A remote descendant of the typewriter. Hmm. Wires. Hey,
<br>
this thing uses electricity. Cool stuff! (Electricity
<br>
in 1901 was something like nooklear in the 1950s) Mouse, 
<br>
largely mechanical  (unless you're evil enough to give 
<br>
them one of these fancy purely optical ones), wires again. 
<br>
Hard drive. Just unscrew it and look at it in operation. Look 
<br>
at the surface with a microscope. Once you realize it's 
<br>
magnetic, you win a lot. CRT (unless you're evil enough to 
<br>
give them a TFT). The color capabilities would astonish them 
<br>
without measure, but the basic shape of the device is almost 
<br>
immediately recognizable if you look under the hood. Or apply 
<br>
a magnet. See the color triples with a loupe. See the color 
<br>
distortions with a magnet.
<br>
<p>Now figuring out the semiconductors would be hard, because
<br>
they are sealed, have tiny leads, switch very fast and
<br>
are a micropatterned substrate, which would exceed their
<br>
analytics. They would do much better with a transistor radio,
<br>
or a vacuum tube computer. In fact the CRT would act as a veritable
<br>
Rosetta stone, because it's based on an ancient technology, and
<br>
uses macroscopic high-power devices, and simple signals.
<br>
<p>Of course this doesn't give them the science behind it,
<br>
and the context in which it was produced. But as a hint and
<br>
as a data point that thing would have been very valuable.
<br>
<p>Things would have been infinitely difficult if you gave the
<br>
same machine to scientists in 1800s, or in 1700s. They'd be
<br>
most likely stymied. Or it'd took them almost forever to
<br>
figure it out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Likewise 100 years from now there will be machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that even the most insightful among us will declare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable from magic.
</em><br>
<p>Except that we'd knew they're not magic, but artifacts
<br>
based on scientific principles. To stick with computers: 
<br>
though we're not seeing 99% of the future, we probably 
<br>
could resolve the elementary cell of computronium, paradoxically
<br>
omega-grade computronium would be easier to figure out,
<br>
because it would likely have a very small elementary cells.
<br>
Of course if it's not orthogonal, i.e. if you have to figure out a
<br>
macroscale artifact which is heterogenous at molecular scale,
<br>
we'd be out of luck. And figuring out the other stuff, we'd
<br>
be in a situation worse than 12th century alchemist trying to
<br>
figure out a modern multimedia machine.
<br>
<p>Hey, someone send us a piece of computronium. Preferably a fully
<br>
functional device, so that it would explain itself, and assist in
<br>
its own reconstruction, provided we're treating it not too shabbily.
<br>
Okay, allright, it would be magic. Artifacts which are also persons
<br>
are a classical requisite of fairy tales. Mirror, mirror on the wall,
<br>
give me the dirt on blue chips today.
