</em><br>
<p>In my parlance, majoritarian means trying to building a political
<br>
party/movement that can win a majority of folks to support it. In practice,
<br>
I'm not very majoritarian, since most of my political passions (progressive
<br>
taxation, drug legalization, polygamy legalization, world government,
<br>
minimum guaranteed income, Mars colonization, freedom for transhuman
<br>
enhancements, etc.) are supported by less than 5% of the population. But
<br>
since winning these policies electorally requires majorities, there is
<br>
little choice but to try to win over the masses. In that respect
<br>
majoritarian is just the opposite of elitist, putschist or John Galtist.

</em><br>
<p>Apparently not so trivial that it failed to give you any humility in the
<br>
certitude of your own beliefs. But then, since you don't come from a
<br>
libertarian family or environment, converts are often the most fervent
<br>
evangelists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;BTW, what's that &quot;pomo-&quot; prefix? &quot;post-modernist&quot;? no comment.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, &quot;pomo&quot; means post-modern, and my phrase &quot;pomo-universalist&quot; means, &quot;I
<br>
can't show why my ethical beliefs are better than anybody else's, but I'm
<br>
still willing to fight for what I think is right.&quot; Maybe I just don't like
<br>
exploitation, genocide, etc., but that's good enough for me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I reject your narrow social determinism.

<em>&gt;My dad ...My mom ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm a libertarian...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So yes, my opinions are somehow the fruit of my past of being confronted
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm sure that's comforting to you, that your libertarianism is simply the
<br>
result of reason and an open mind, but I feel the same way about my beliefs.
<br>
If the degree to which you disagree with your parents and school about
<br>
politics was an indicator of the degree to which reason guides your
<br>
politics, skinhead Nazis would be the most reasonable of all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But there is no certainty in values or politics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's a loathable self-defeating statement.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there are some wonderful French philosophers I could recommend you
<br>
read, such as Camus, Foucault and Lyotard, but I suppose you probably
<br>
already have.
<br>
<p>For me, it all comes back to Hume, and the unbridgeable gap between the Is
<br>
and the Ought. One can prove the Is, but the Ought is always, at root, a
<br>
leap of faith. If you have an airtight reason why your idea about the Good
<br>
is better than mine, I'd love to hear it.
