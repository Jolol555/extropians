'Virtual reality' is on horizon - really
<br>
<a href="http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/1,1249,270017782,00.html">http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/1,1249,270017782,00.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2020, you'll still be able to tell what's real from what's not. But
<br>
by 2030, as tactile immersion is achieved, there will be &quot;no clear distinction
<br>
between virtual reality and reality,&quot; [Ray Kurzweil] said.
<br>
--------
<br>
The computer as we know it will become as obsolete as an 8-track cassette
<br>
because everything's getting smaller, Kurzweil said. Eventually, transistors
<br>
will be as small as a few atoms. Processing power is doubling every year. The
<br>
very near future holds &quot;ubiquitous high bandwidth.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those factors merge, he said, we will be computing all the time,
<br>
though we won't use computers.

<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
