<p>I've walked through mockups of some modules at Cape Kennedy, and there
<br>
really is not much &quot;shoulder room&quot; in there. Racks of equipment take up
<br>
both sides leaving room for perhaps two people shoulder to shoulder but
<br>
not three. Although the total volume of all modules may be a 747, it
<br>
is going to be very &quot;long and thin&quot; space.
