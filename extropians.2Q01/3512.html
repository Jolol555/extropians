<p>For that matter, how will it make anti-religious fanatics nicer? :-)  I
<br>
get pretty damned tired of some of the religion/spirituality bashing on

here.  Not all relgious people are a bunch of mis-programmed

bible-waving idiots.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; close to this!&quot;...  Finally there will be no more reason to fight and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kill each other!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really think so? When the SI parts the Red Sea, feeds the worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hungry, demonstrates that it can give total bliss and explain everything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will just say: &quot;So what? You are note a real god, since you were created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by humans. *God* is beyond the universe and far, far beyond what you are. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, He even predicted you - read Revelations about the Antichrist!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it would be good to pause now and then and consider whether
<br>
what we build is more likely to lead toward a heaven-on-earth or to
<br>
hell.  Now and then it is not a bad idea to just for a moment consider
<br>
whether we are designing &quot;the Antichrist&quot; in what it does and does not
<br>
mean for humanity.  
<br>
<p>But I doubt that most believers are going to fail to see that what is
<br>
promised in their religions is delivered (if it is).  Those who want a
<br>
God beyond this will simply posit a deeper level of mystery or of higher
<br>
Power than the local ones.  They might claim ours is the anti-Christ
<br>
regardless but their claim would be weak as it would be based on their
<br>
own fallible interpretations of ancient texts and on their own &quot;gut
<br>
feelings&quot;.  It will help if our efforts truly are full of universal
<br>
goodwill. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You make the mistake to apply our way of thinking (highly empirical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalist) to people who do not think that way (religious fanatics).
</em><br>
<p>You must be joking.  Saying that any human based creature is fully
<br>
rational in all respects is highly dubious.  Implying that all relgious
<br>
people are fanatics and/or so different from you and yours is also
<br>
highly dubious and very much at the heart of religious and greater meme
<br>
conflicts. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of them will fall to the lure of the SI, but given what we know of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human nature the SI would likely have to resort to direct brain surgery to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince some of them. Which is of course the problem: exactly how far do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow a &quot;friendly&quot; entity to go in its quest to help us? I would definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not support such an entity if it ignored the right to one's life, body,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts and property.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if we start talking about direct brain surgery to change the minds
<br>
of sentient beings then we are straying into &quot;anti-Christ&quot; territory. 
<br>
That said, it might be that many types of sentients cannot peacefully
<br>
coexist in the same space and the only way to avoid a massive war and
<br>
kill-off is to move them to different physical or virtual worlds and let
<br>
them work out their own understanding perhaps over multiple lives worth
<br>
of experience.  
<br>
<p>Here's to the technological Boddhisattvas!
