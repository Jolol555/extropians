<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha is asking the exactly the right questions, and I haven't yet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;seen any followup. Succinctly, what does Flare do that necessitates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inventing a completely new wheel?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Attaching user supplied meta data to language constructs is trivial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and not a novel idea - though long term exposure to C++ damages one's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;brain enough it may seem otherwise. The non-trivial part is inventing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a useful mark up language: What is it you want to say about a piece
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of code it doesn't already say about itself? How expressive is your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;language going to be, and where does it fall between javadoc and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'here's some code you can run, it tells you something about some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other code.' Forget about implementation and think about what you're
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;trying to accomplish.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a look at the literate programming faq. Skim a decent Lisp text
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and write some Prolog or Haskell or something else to break out of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the code as dead text / compilation is conversion to noise model and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;get your mind some fresh air. Lisp blew the top of my head off the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;first time I got into it - in C++ if you want a general 'foreach'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;construct you duct tape some hideous template / iterator mess from a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;language without the type system to properly support it. In Lisp you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;write a trivial function of a function.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had years and a very bright team with serious language design
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background, you might do better than something you could download
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;today. I don't think though you appreciate what a enormous task
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;simply specifying a non-toy language would be or what it would take
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to improve on the state of the art.
