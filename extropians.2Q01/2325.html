<em>&gt; The Republic of Mars is a virtual nation (or micronation), all immigrants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are welcome. Check out our web site at: www.marsgov.net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a little over 4 months, our community has grown to over 500 members.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, we are always on the lookout for hard working people who wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join us.
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Is it just my perceptions, or are &quot;efforts&quot; like this actively harmful
<br>
towards actually colonizing Mars?  Despite their intent, they
<br>
contribute nothing towards that end that has not already been
<br>
contributed by more effective organizations, and they raise the spectre
<br>
that, should someone actually manage to get people to and from Mars on
<br>
a regular basis, these organizations might claim to have some standing
<br>
to sue and otherwise interfere with successful operations (&quot;we owned
<br>
Mars first&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We also have an active science community - the Mars Academy of Sciences and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology (MAST) has just been founded. One of the first tasks for MAST
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be to submit to Parliament plans for our first city on the surface of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mars.
</em><br>
<p>I predict that cities on Mars will be planned and built by people who
<br>
are actually there, and that no one will pay any attention to city
<br>
plans made in ignorance of local conditions when it comes time to
<br>
actually build the thing.
<br>
<p>Sorry for the negativity, but like I said, these efforts seem to be
<br>
actively harmful, and thus deserve countering.  (As opposed to, say,
<br>
passively harmful, where the &quot;harm&quot; is limited to wasting the
<br>
participants' time and other resources, and does not extend to those
<br>
not involved in the project.)
