I was thinking in particular of a guy named Mawson who went through 
<br>
hell at the South Pole and lost something like half his body weight, 
<br>
starting at something like 270 (been 15, 20 years since I read about 
<br>
it) and very little of it fat. Now this is extreme, nuking the 
<br>
calories to stave off cold and damned near starving to death. (His 
<br>
dogs and supplies went down a crevasse, bye-bye, then his skinnier 
<br>
partner went terminal croaked and he couldn't bring himself to leave 
<br>
before he croaked or to eat him afterward.) Gets my vote as Toughest 
<br>
SOB Ever To Walk The Earth.
<br>
<p>Anyway, even a situation not so extreme--anything demanding reserves 
<br>
for survival (whether because of illness or environment), if you 
<br>
don't have 'em, you're outta the game.
<br>
<p>I've been poking around, looking at CR--and (aside from thinking 
<br>
people of that bodyweight CAN'T be healthy) it just seems to me that 
<br>
depending on personal habits (office worker or mountain climber/south 
<br>
pole explorer, for example) and the fickle flagellae of 
<br>
microorganisms, CR could make you more likely to die early. (This 
<br>
excluding attack by large fur-bearing mammals, which may require some 
<br>
serious body mass for protection/attack.)
<br>
<p>Then you take something like cancer and chemo, which sucks up the 
<br>
pounds--the more you start with, the longer you seem to last.
<br>
<p>All told, I'm not sure CR is a reasonable bet you'll live longer.
<br>
<p>??

<em>&gt; About the reserves, it is true and false.  Think about this, body reserves form

<em>&gt; fat are left over as a defense from back in the days when food might be

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If available, I think they would be MOST interesting to the group.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; How do I get all that stuff?  I have records from 18 blood donations,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ive never been scientific about CR other than to alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; vitamins, a few months with, a few months without for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; several years to see what they do, and to vary the calories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to see if there is any correllation, CR with depression/anxiety,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; or anything else.  I kept a record book for a few years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as a teenager.  My admittedly unscientific finding: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; vitamins didn't do anything at all, and if there is any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; correllation between CR and depression it was weak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed in my case.  Perhaps I was using the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; vitamins?  Mine were standard grocery store variety,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing exotic.  I eventually gave them up, but I may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; go back again to a limited regimen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Were you a skinny sort of guy before you started CR? To me, at 70.5&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 165lbs and 8% bodyfat, 6' 125lbs seems almost borderline impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ja, its scary.  My BMI has always been in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; neighborhood of 17.  On the brighter side, Ive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; escaped the health problems that have cursed

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; my family.  Im 40:  several people have told me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that I dont look a day over 39.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, they told me that 10 years ago, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lets not get hung up in the details.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; On the down side, Im pretty sure that CR causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; severe brain damage.  Thats my story anyway, and Im
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sticking to it.  spike
