I think that even this conversation is moot... Why would any
<br>
body try to argue against a foolish outlook? You just point
<br>
at them and go &quot;FOOLISH&quot;... that should be sufficient... Yes?
<br>
<p>A person either believes in insurance or they don't. We call
<br>
the people who don't victims and if they're really lucky victims
<br>
we call them survivors.
<br>
<p>My belief has nothing to do with it. The only alterntive that
<br>
insures I even have a whisper of a chance of surviving a car
<br>
crash, or coronary, or having the International Space Station
<br>
fall on me, is to get my vital bits into cryosuspension, as quickly
<br>
as possible after the signs of life leave the meat... Everything
<br>
other option has me recycling carbon, nitrogen, and working
<br>
at my own little personal entropy.

nothing more that make sure they have a lawnchair in a good position

<p><em>&gt; The fact is, no one can be that certain. You have to have a backup plan

<p>Of course not, that was never the question... it has much more to do

with am I somebody who covers my bases, or somebody let's the

chips fall where they may...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to mention the fact that it would really suck to die in an accident

</em><br>
<p>Now you're just making sense... this isn't a sensible conversation, it has
<br>
nothing to do with sense... the only sensible choice is to set up some
<br>
kind of insurance policy that pays for cryonics if you bite the semi big

one...

<p>Lame arguement...
<br>
On the Whoops I missed Singularity side:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it's an insurance policy that you can change, you don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spend the money till your hinny needs a liquid N2 bath
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyway... so you only spends it if ya needs it...
<br>
<p>On the flip side...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you assume that money will be something more valuable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then funny paper with old dead white guys on it after the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;singularity hits... interesting thought... hmmmm.
<br>
<p>Christian... didn't anybody ever wave a boy scout at you???
<br>
Ever heard of BE PREPARED? or how about MURPHY's
<br>
LAW??? One takes meaningful and thoughful precautions
<br>
to insure that one's vital contribution to the species remains
<br>
intact... your arguement verges on a Darwinian Selection
<br>
Factor... think about it.
