<p><em>&gt; I was watching a CNN report, on an issue that has been brewing since last

<em>&gt; year, when an org funded by Gates of Microsoft, and Larry Elison of Oracle

<em>&gt; had a 'study' that postulated something like 1.5 million IT jobs would be 
</em><br>

<p>Mitch, knowing Larry to the degree that I do, I very much doubt he
<br>
would cooperate with Bill on anything (even something that is
<br>
to their mutual advantage).  I would strongly urge you to
<br>
investigate the background sources on your comments.  While
<br>
it is not implausible that they both may have contributed to
<br>
such an effort, it would be *un*-likely that they did so knowing
<br>
that the other was involved.  In which case the awards should go to
<br>
the individual behind the scenes that got them both to contribute.
<br>
<p>Microsoft and Oracle both have overseas software development
<br>
efforts.  To be promoting the emmigration of these people
<br>
to the U.S. seems counter productive.  You will always have
<br>
to pay them more within-U.S. relative to non-U.S. locations.
<br>
<p>To make a case that MSFT or ORACLE are behind this, you have
<br>
to make a case that it is more to their advantage to move
<br>
offshore workers to the U.S. where the salaries would be higher.
