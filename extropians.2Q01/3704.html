<em>&gt; PLONK?  You spend four years flaming me for being insufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced and not having gone direct to implementation, and then Ben
</em><br>
<p>As you might have noticed, I haven't started criticizing (not flaming,
<br>
I have yet never flamed anybody on this list, not even come close) you
<br>
immediately -- only after I've seen other people reacting positively
<br>
to your proposal, sufficiently so that I become worried.
<br>
<p>You're opinionated and eloquent, but a troll you're not. Occasionally,
<br>
you cruise too high on testosterone, but I did much worse, and at a 
<br>
later age, so I don't have any right to criticize you on that. (The
<br>
good thing, it will pass).
<br>
<p>I think however, that you're wasting your time, which you at a later 
<br>
time you may come to regret (recall the staged windows of opportunity,
<br>
as created by other people's expectations of you, and age artifacts), 
<br>
and other people's. In my curmugeonly, unasked-for way I tried 
<br>
sundry smiles, soap and railway shares, until I ran into 
<br>
diminishing ROI. Fine. It's yours and other people's time and 
<br>
effort, not mine.  Moreover, I should be less ambivalent about this, 
<br>
and be glad that you're poking around in the area which is so totally 
<br>
barren.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Goertzel comes along and you KILLFILE him?  Well, I'm glad to see the
</em><br>
<p>Ben &quot;Webmind&quot; Goertzel? He didn't have any brownie points in my book, and 
<br>
he ran out of the default issue stock in record time, which is quite
<br>
an accomplishment. I can be aggravating, and at times I'm being deliberately 
<br>
so, but his response pattern was 24 ct genuine troll (or a brilliant
<br>
imitation thereof), and a troll of the more crude, warty variety. 
<br>
Almost no technical points, several red herrings, thinly veiled
<br>
statements &quot;you no good. you suck so badly you're not worth arguing with&quot;.
<br>
Okay, so let's remove the cause (but not  the symptoms).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; reaction I could have expected from you if I'd actually gone along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your recommendations!
</em><br>
<p>Huh?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I guess this just confirms my original take on your proposal; the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who currently flame me for not having a doctorate or not having source
</em><br>
<p>I personally don't care a fig about a doctorate. One of the most 
<br>
brilliant persons I've personally known has never been in an 
<br>
university programme. A Ph.D. can be very easily bought, obtained
<br>
by nepotism, or by sheer bottom of your pants. God knows I've
<br>
seen enough braindead Ph.Ds.
<br>
<p>However, letters are world's way of measuring prestige. They're your
<br>
attached accomplishment track, however crude and biased, and if you 
<br>
want to work with people who don't know you from Adam It Really Helps.
<br>
In many fields a Ph.D. with honours from a good school and a few
<br>
publications is just an entry ticket to get an interview with a 
<br>
top-notch PI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; code are the same people who would be flaming me just as virulently for
</em><br>
<p>By riling you about not having a functional prototype I was attempting
<br>
two goals: 1) less Eliezer in my mailbox 2) Eliezer cutting his teeth
<br>
on the diamond boulder, and going for something with a brighter success
<br>
outlook. Which, of course, is inconsistent. I don't want my day ruined,
<br>
no sir. Better Eliezer saying &quot;a heap of straw&quot; than a ruined day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; not having twenty years experience if I did spend five years getting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctorate, or who'll be flaming me for having the wrong source code in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of years.
</em><br>
<p>As I rule, and a means of last resort before ceasing communication 
<br>
I only flame people I consider effectively evil. Right now that
<br>
badge of dubious honour belongs to Robert Ettinger alone. May he rot in peace.
