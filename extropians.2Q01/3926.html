Just as we put various odors in combustible fuels for safety reasons, the 
<br>
same could be done for hydrogen, and a visual waveband emitting dopiant as 
<br>
well

<p>One thing that will probably keep natural gas as the fuel of choice is that
<br>
hydrogen will embrittle and ultimately make steel gas lines fail. Also,

hydrogen burns with a colorless flame (it does emit UV, that's how you can
<br>
detect a hydrogen fire) so there are safety concerns with piping the pure
<br>
gas around the country.
