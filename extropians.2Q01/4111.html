<p>Here Comes The Holodeck: Virtual Reality + Artificial Intelligence = New 
<br>
Training Tool
<br>
<p>The use of virtual reality or arcade games to practice hand-eye coordination 
<br>
or quick reaction, or even to teach factual information is easy to understand 
<br>
and well accepted. But can such techniques also teach sound judgement and 
<br>
clear thinking in an emergency? 
<br>
New programs developed by the University of Southern California's Information 
<br>
Sciences Institute (ISI) and two other cooperating USC institutes are 
<br>
designed to do just this by melding advances in artificial intelligence with 
<br>
state of the art work in rendering virtual environments in animation and 
<br>
sound. 
<br>
<p>A &quot;Mission Rehearsal Exercise&quot; developed for the U.S. Army by ISI, the USC 
<br>
Institute for Creative Technology (ICT), and the USC Integrated Media Systems 
<br>
Center (IMSC) takes soldier-trainees on a virtual reality mission in a 
<br>
troubled town in Bosnia. There, they must deal with a situation threatening 
<br>
to spin out of control. 
<br>
<p>It uses a movie-theater-sized (8 -feet tall, 31-foot wide) curved screen that 
<br>
looms around trainees. Combining with the screen images is highly directional 
<br>
and lifelike &quot;immersive sound,&quot; creating a convincing illusion of being 
<br>
present at the scene, rather than observing a show. 
<br>
<p>The scene is populated with animated figures that exist only as computer 
<br>
programs, but are nevertheless autonomous agents who can interact with human 
<br>
trainees in real time. 
<br>
<p>An article about the Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE) program appeared in the 
<br>
documentation for AAAI Spring Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and 
<br>
Interactive Entertainment, at Stanford University March 26-28 2001. 
<br>
Presentation of another paper, along with partial demonstration of the system 
<br>
is scheduled for the Agents 2001 conference in Montreal, Que. May 28-June 1, 
<br>
2001. 
<br>
<p>The army simulation is an early attempt to reach toward the &quot;holodeck,&quot; the 
<br>
virtual reality training and recreation facility seen in &quot;Star Trek: The Next 
<br>
Generation,&quot; according to project leader Jeff Rickel of ISI. 
<br>
<p>In one simulation scenario, a lieutenant enters the village to deal with one 
<br>
problem -- a weapons inspection team being threatened by an angry crowd -- 
<br>
and finds another one as well: an American jeep has accidentally struck and 
<br>
injured a local child. 
<br>
<p>Should the lieutenant split his forces to deal with both situations? If so, 
<br>
how? Meanwhile, a TV camera crew arrives, further complicating the situation. 
<br>
<p>The scene of the village uses 3-D computer modeling to create basic shapes 
<br>
visible from any angle enhanced by texture mapping. The group used commercial 
<br>
software from Boston Dynamics to add animations of people, and an extremely 
<br>
sophisticated sound system -- with multiple sound tracks (up to 64 tracks for 
<br>
some effects) played through no less than 12 speaker channels. Chris 
<br>
Kyriakakis of the IMSC created this system. 
<br>
<p>Two kinds of autonomous software agents inhabit this complex and convincing 
<br>
environment. Most are basic robotic programs that carry on a limited range of 
<br>
pre-scripted, routinized behavior -- milling in the background, standing 
<br>
around, etc. 
<br>
<p>Three -- the detachment medic and sergeant, and the anxious mother -- are 
<br>
more complex. These are software actors who have substantial abilities to 
<br>
react to what the trainee does. Their faces change expression, thanks to 
<br>
software from the Santa Cruz, CA-based Haptek Corporation. They move, and 
<br>
most strikingly, they can respond to speech. 
<br>
<p>Scripted characters are relatively easy to create, explains Rickel, &quot;but have 
<br>
limited flexibility, making them well suited for bit parts.&quot; AI characters 
<br>
are more difficult to program, but can interact with people and with their 
<br>
environment in more flexible ways, making them well suited for key roles such 
<br>
as the mother, sergeant, and medic, who all have to interact with the human 
<br>
lieutenant. 
<br>
<p>Research by Rickel and his colleagues, who also include Jonathan Gratch, 
<br>
Randall Hill, and William Swartout of ICT and Stacy Marsella of ISI, has 
<br>
built on earlier work at ISI by Rickel and W. Lewis Johnson developing a 
<br>
teaching agent called &quot;Steve.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Steve instructed Navy recruits in a virtual-reality world presented through 
<br>
VR glasses, responding to their simple questions. The Sergeant and the Medic 
<br>
are more advanced versions of Steve. Steve's appearance has been updated from 
<br>
the legless floating presence in the early version to a more lifelike form. 
<br>
<p>The third AI character, the Mother, adds another layer: she goes beyond words 
<br>
to the expression of emotions. Gratch and Marsella were responsible for this 
<br>
feature. 
<br>
<p>Another major addition to the Steve agent is the use of a dramatic story 
<br>
line, with continuing incidents driving the action. To keep score at the end, 
<br>
a television story reported by the news crew on the scene records the result 
<br>
of the trainee's responses to the situation, chronicling either an abandoned 
<br>
boy in critical condition, or a boy out of danger because of timely action. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The work we have done in one way shows how far away the holodeck is -- but 
<br>
in another shows how useful it may be,&quot; Rickel said. &quot;The project represents 
<br>
a grand challenge for both AI and virtual reality, but the potential payoff 
<br>
is a powerful new medium for experiential learning.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;What makes the Mission Rehearsal Exercise project unique is that we are 
<br>
bringing together for the first time a set of technologies including 
<br>
immersive audio, large scale graphics, and virtual humans and linking them to 
<br>
an interactive story line to create a compelling experience.&quot; added William 
<br>
Swartout of the ICT. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The synergies that result are powerful. We were surprised to find that even 
<br>
though the system is still at its beginnings, some people came away from the 
<br>
simulation emotionally moved. I don't think this effect is due to any one 
<br>
element alone, but rather it is due to all of them working together.&quot;
