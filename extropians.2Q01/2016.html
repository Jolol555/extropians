<p>Well, that's the way things are in **any** hierarchical organization
<br>
(which, among humans, means pretty much any organization, period), isn't it?
<br>
Whatever meta-rules the organization itself pays lip service to, the
<br>
everyday job of its members is to do what the boss wants, right up
<br>
the chain of command to the top.
<br>
<p>Of course, that doesn't let anybody off the hook if there's ex-post-facto
<br>
punishment being meted out by a higher authority -- a war-crimes trial,
<br>
or the criminal investigation of a business organization.  That's the
<br>
sort of situation that makes great fictional entertainment, but that
<br>
would be among anybody's worst nightmares to be involved in personally.
<br>
<p>RIPLEY:  Just tell me how you can leave that kind of decision to him.
<br>
<p>DALLAS:  Look, I just run the ship!  Anything that has to do with the
<br>
Science Division, Ash has the final word.
<br>
<p>RIPLEY:  How does that happen?
<br>
<p>DALLAS:  It happens, my dear, because that's what the Company **wants**
<br>
to happen.
<br>
<p>RIPLEY:  Since when is that standard procedure?
<br>
<p>DALLAS:  Standard procedure is to **do** what the hell they tell you to do.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>RIPLEY:  I don&quot;t trust him.
<br>
<p>DALLAS:  I don't trust **anybody**.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers.
