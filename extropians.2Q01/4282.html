</em><br>
<p>(Vorlon voice:)  &quot;We are all Bayesian statisticians.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But why are the parents who *do* say &quot;At least...&quot;   different than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the parents who *could* say it?
</em><br>
<p>For the same reason that the set of people who can jump off buildings is
<br>
different from the set of people who do jump off buildings.  I deny that
<br>
the distinction between &quot;mathematician&quot; and &quot;statistician&quot; is the right
<br>
one to make here.  The mathematician is not being confronted with the fact
<br>
that a person *could* say something but the fact that the person *did* say
<br>
something.  Now, if the mathematician were to ask the father &quot;Is at least
<br>
one of your children a girl?&quot; and the father answered &quot;Yes&quot;, that would be
<br>
an *entirely different* matter.  In fact, I bet that if you presented the
<br>
riddle this way, a much larger percentage of the reasoners would get it
<br>
right the first time.
<br>
<p>Hey, I just made a testable prediction!  Anyone want to try it?  Robin?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The earlier idea, who *could* truthfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say what, seems much easier to grasp.  As for what people do say, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would seem to me to depend a great deal upon the particular situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One easily contrives a situation where even under *do* I'm right:  King
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harod orders everybody who could say it to go to a mathematician and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually say it, etc. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's why I said that the riddle does not adequately specify the
<br>
priors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What situations do you have in mind where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Out of all the parents who *do* say &quot;At least one of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Situations where those parents who have both a boy and a girl will choose
<br>
at random whether to say &quot;At least one of my children is a boy&quot; or &quot;at
<br>
least one of my children is a girl&quot;.
