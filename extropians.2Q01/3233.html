<em>&gt;&gt; What do extropians consider to be the most common errors made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	The biggest mistake everyone makes is thinking that one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;hope&quot; or &quot;have faith&quot; that there is already any kind of a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power.  If one believes or accepts that there is already some higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power (Gods, ETs or whatever) out there hiding from us, yet watching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and occasionally influencing our existence, while there is still evils
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like isolation, suffering, death... is just the opposite of faith and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hope.  Accepting that there is any higher power, while there is evil,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the ultimate in giving up in despair.  If such really does already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exist we are eternally screwed and we have no hope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	If one accepts that there is already a higher power, then one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must spend his days trying to theodicies or justify evil in the face
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of this higher power.  If one accepts this, they have no hope of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overcoming evil, even if they become as powerful as this higher power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For if this higher, even all powerful being, can't do it, how can we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever hope to do any better!?  The theist spends all his days in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;futile effort trying to come up with various absurd theodicies in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempt to justify it and their already all powerful God.  They can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hope to overcome evil, so they must instead try to justify it and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how attempt to try to twist it into being good.  The theist can't hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to overcome evil, but instead merely attempts to justify and accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	But if you &quot;hope&quot; there isn't already a higher power, then and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only then can you have &quot;faith&quot; that perhaps such evils aren't all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hard to overcome and aren't all that necessary.  You can work with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faith and hope that we are about to overcome all such evils.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	A theists that claims to have faith and hope is a liar.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atheist is the only one that can have true and honest faith and hope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;	Despite how blatantly obvious this is, for some reason, no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can see it.
</em><br>
