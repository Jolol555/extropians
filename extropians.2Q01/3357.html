<em>&gt; Basically, Eli, as much as I like and admire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, the attitude &quot;Let others worry about the starving people in the Sudan;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my job is to save them by building a Friendly AI that will produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity&quot; sort of gets on my nerves.
</em><br>
<p>I AM worried about the starving people in the Sudan.  And repression in
<br>
China.  And child abuse and urban poverty in the US.  And the work
<br>
environment that slowly sucks the life force out of the middle class.  And
<br>
everyone who isn't as smart or as famous or as important as they want to
<br>
be.  And everyone, everywhere, every moment of every day, who dies, and
<br>
would rather have lived.
<br>
<p>I didn't inherit a family business in AI.  I didn't fall into this because
<br>
it had an easy college major, or because I was curious about AI.  I
<br>
deliberately set out to ameliorate suffering on the largest possible
<br>
scale, and AI is how I chose to do it.
<br>
<p>If you can't, on a deep emotional level, see the connection between my
<br>
work and the starving people in the Sudan, then this - from my perspective
<br>
- is an emotional peculiarity on your part, not mine.  Since I *do*
<br>
perceive the connection on a deep emotional level, I live free of the fog
<br>
of guilt that pervades the First World.  There is absolutely *nothing* I
<br>
could do that would help the rest of the world more than what I am already
<br>
doing.  I feel a need to do something about the starving people in the
<br>
Sudan and I AM DOING IT; that need is now FULLY SATISFIED.  Rather than
<br>
striving for &quot;balance&quot; between personal life and altruism, I have decided
<br>
to allow my desire to be altruistic to *completely* dictate my life-path. 
<br>
And, having done so, and for as long as I continue to do so, that desire
<br>
is satisfied; satiated; fulfilled.
<br>
<p>I think, Ben, that we react to certain problems in different ways.  You
<br>
see starving people in Sudan and think to yourself:  &quot;Is what I'm doing
<br>
really helping?  Maybe I should just give it all away.&quot;  There was a time
<br>
when I felt guilty on seeing starving people in Sudan, and what I thought
<br>
to myself was:  &quot;Could I be working a little harder?  Am I making the
<br>
wrong tradeoff between rest time and work time, or between energy
<br>
expenditure and energy recovery?&quot;  In other words, I saw starving people
<br>
in Sudan and felt guilty - so I worked faster.  (Nowadays I'm a bit more
<br>
confident that I'm at the right equilibrium, and being guilty does
<br>
dissipate mental energy, so I try to implement a policy of only
<br>
reevaluating work habits when new information arrives.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this isn't the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing for which one can make a logical argument.
</em><br>
<p>*What*?  Oh, never mind.  (Now, if you were to say, &quot;I'm sure there is a
<br>
logical argument for this, but I haven't learned to formalize my gut
<br>
feelings,&quot; that would be another matter.)
