<p>You don't really grok the concept of Singularity, do you? There's two
<br>
important point about it, to my mind...
<br>
<p>- It's already beginning. The &quot;spike&quot; is an extrapolation of occurences from
<br>
before now.
<br>
- You can't be prepared... at best, you can be less unprepared than everyone
<br>
else.
<br>
- Extinction? In this context, that's all about definitions.
<br>
- It is no way pre-determined that a technological singularity will occur.
<br>
It seems likely, but a lot can happen between now and then. The absence of
<br>
pre-destination in all things, including the human environment of the near
<br>
future, is the basic reason that tranhumanism, and extropianism, need to
<br>
exist.
