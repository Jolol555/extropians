<p>Interestingly enough, Vinton Cerf is right now developing TCP/IP derived

protocols for interplanetary Internet (InterPlaNet? ;) Oh, I see he's calling
<br>
it just that:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.worldcom.com/about_the_company/cerfs_up/presentations/interplan/">http://www.worldcom.com/about_the_company/cerfs_up/presentations/interplan/</a>

<p>). The problem set is similiar to relativistic ACK delays when traffic is 
<br>
routed via GEO. If your relativistic lag is in minute range, and you're sending 
<br>
with a high bitrate you obviously need very deep buffers, or a new paradigm.
<br>
Essentially, you're forced to go to a 'fire and forget' type of communication,
<br>
the bits receding from you like tracer bullets. Packet loss might be delegated
<br>
to application layer.
<br>
<p>Anyway, they'll probably put up quite a few relays and only for the
<br>
planned Mars missions, so you either get higher bitrate or can go with 
<br>
lower power transmitters. I wonder why space probes don't carry redundant 
<br>
solid state cameras (you can make them pencil-eraser sized these days), 
<br>
as they would be very handy for orientation in space. Instead of a single 
<br>
navigation star you look at a dot pattern in a CCD array, and if you 
<br>
track planets and planetesimals and know their ephemerids you can even 
<br>
find out where you are, and what your speed vector is. And of course 
<br>
you could use the nodes for relativistic pings, for a solar positioning 
<br>
service, too.
<br>
<p>A time-collapsed sequence of stills showing the Earth visibly receding and
<br>
the Sun turning into a yet another star would be truly cool to see. NASA
<br>
could sell the tape to news agencies, or to Hollywood (but hurry, the
<br>
VFX are getting better day by day).
