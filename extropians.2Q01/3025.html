<p>
Hello All,
<br>
<p>I'm new to the list (I've been on for about a week, reading and
<br>
getting an idea of how things work here.) I met a number of you
<br>
at the Foresight Conference this last weekend, and I am very
<br>
happy to make many of your aquaintances.
<br>
<p>That said, I want to address something. It could look a little like;
<br>
Matt don't be churlish and Eliezer don't be defensive. Unfortunately
<br>
that wouldn't make any lasting difference, and it would leave me
<br>
feeling a little like somebodies mother.
<br>
<p>Let's try something completely different...
<br>
<p>I've been part of many projects, and I always find it fascinating that
<br>
the very thing that drives us, compells us to be extraordinary also
<br>
illicits from us such counterproductive behavior.
<br>
<p>Matt, I can completely get your passion, your fascination with this
<br>
endeavor. You want to know, and you want to know NOW!!! You
<br>
are bright, and you have things to say, ideas to contribute. You want
<br>
this new and wonderful future and you want it sometime about 9:45
<br>
AM, yesterday morning... yes??? Would I also be completely wrong
<br>
if I described you as a bit impatient, about the things you love.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, you are such an amazing young man. You have such vision,
<br>
and compassion. You are driven by the need to serve humanity, and
<br>
you are driven by the dignity of the human spirit. Your intelligence is
<br>
only exceded by your hunger to build an amazing future for all people,
<br>
if need be with your bare hands from whole cloth. I acknowledge you
<br>
for your greatness, and I applaud you for your courage. That said,
<br>
you are going to have to transform yourself, unfold the personality you
<br>
are, and create yourself new. You are out to change tomorrow and
<br>
all the other tomorrows that follow it. You will need to redesign the
<br>
you, you know yourself to be, to be commesurate to the future you
<br>
are committed to creating. For a start, you will need to be an leader
<br>
of unprecedented power. You will have to be able to inspire others,
<br>
able to move them to act, and to see your vision as their own. If you
<br>
would like to sit down sometime and have a long talk about the kind
<br>
of technology that serves this purpose, let me know.
<br>
<p>What most people call communication is indistinguishable from passing
<br>
gas in a crowded room. They push hot air through an orifice, relief
<br>
themselves of a little emotional stress, and walk away having left a
<br>
stink in the room. I say, communication, at it's best is not dumping,
<br>
but causing. Speaking to cause in others. At it best, it leaves others
<br>
touched, moved, and inspired. I request that we take on being fully
<br>
responsible for how we leave others, and begin to train to speak to
<br>
cause. Complaining is fine, but you better mention what it is that you
<br>
are committed to creating to resolve the problem you describe. You
<br>
can call somebody on an issue, and you want to be clear that when
<br>
you communication is complete, they are left not abused, but
<br>
empowered and inspired to be your partner in resolving that issue.
<br>
<p>It is taking responsibility for how your words leave the world around
<br>
you, and speaking purposefully to cause what you are committed to.
<br>
<p>I will speak soon about what I see is possible here, and what I want
<br>
to leave this group as a function of my speaking. For now, thank you
<br>
for creating such a wonderful place, and I promise there's a lot more
<br>
to say.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am quite happy to answer questions about &quot;Friendly AI&quot;, a vision which

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing the inadequate documentation of visions whose writeups are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still on the &quot;To Do&quot; list and discuss one of the visions I've had time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; document?  Say, causal goal systems with Bayesian reinforcement subsuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the functionality of pain and pleasure, or feature extraction for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linear and temporal sensory modalities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Considering that I was right in the middle of announcing Friendly AI when
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; complaining about Flare to complaining about the documentation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; codic sensory modality if I *did* drop everything and work on Flare?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact is that I'm on a big task, and the pieces of the overall structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've described are being documented one by one.  There will always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of stuff I haven't gotten to yet.  If you want to discuss details,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest you focus on what *has* been documented, instead of demanding
</em><br>
