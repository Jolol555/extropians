<p>Unsustainable Predictions
<br>
<p>by William L. Anderson
<br>
<p>[Posted April 3, 2001]
<br>
<p>While in college during the early 1970s, many of my professors gave me a 
<br>
large dose of gloom and doom about the future. In a religion class, we read 
<br>
Robert Heilbroner’s An Inquiry into the Human Prospect, in which the good 
<br>
professor predicted that the end of industrial society was imminent because 
<br>
the world was quickly going to run out of resources.
<br>
<p>My high school chemistry teacher convinced me to purchase Paul Ehrlich’s 
<br>
1968 &quot;classic,&quot; The Population Bomb, because Ehrlich supposedly had a real 
<br>
handle on the future, depressing though it might be. (The first line of this 
<br>
book declared, &quot;The battle to feed humanity is over.&quot; Worldwide famine, 
<br>
Ehrlich declared, had won.)
<br>
<p>Of course, I am still waiting for The End—as Heibroner and Ehrlich described 
<br>
it—to appear. Being wrong, however, apparently has not damaged their 
<br>
credibility with journalists or economists, given the worshipful tones they 
<br>
use when speaking their names. Even though our economies—and population—have 
<br>
continued to grow rapidly since the mid-1970s, predictions continue that The 
<br>
Last Days are just around the corner, and many people still believe them.
<br>
<p>While listening to National Government Radio recently, I heard a cheery spot 
<br>
about a &quot;sustainable development&quot; program at a nearby college here in South 
<br>
Carolina. Students and faculty members, it seems, are joining forces to 
<br>
demonstrate how sustainable development can take place within a &quot;college 
<br>
community.&quot; Of course, the term &quot;sustainable development&quot; carries the 
<br>
implication that economic development in the real world somehow is not 
<br>
&quot;sustainable.&quot;
<br>
<p>Heilbroner outlined this way of thinking in Inquiry in 1974:
<br>
<p>Ultimately, there is an absolute limit to the ability of the earth to 
<br>
support or tolerate the process of industrial activity, and there is reason 
<br>
to believe that we now are moving toward that limit very rapidly.
<br>
<p>He then &quot;projected&quot; that if world industrial production were to continue to 
<br>
grow at its current pace for the next fifty years, it would mean resource 
<br>
demands of one thousand times what they were in 1974. This is all simple 
<br>
math, of course, but it paints a very silly picture of how human beings act. 
<br>
Heilbroner’s predictions are like the scene in the movie Animal House, where 
<br>
a band marching down an alley into a wall does not turn around, but rather 
<br>
tries to strut forward as though the wall were not there.
<br>
<p>Heilbroner contended that such growth could not be sustained at that level 
<br>
of resource use, so economic growth inevitably would have to stop very soon 
<br>
into the future. Although it is unlikely that religion professors are 
<br>
forcing their hapless students to read Inquiry these days, the Gospel of 
<br>
Heilbroner and Ehrlich lives on in another movement—the push for sustainable 
<br>
development. This latest wave of wrongheaded thinking is not just confined 
<br>
to a small South Carolina college.
<br>
<p>The gist of the various sustainable-development moves around the nation, 
<br>
whether they are part of the overall program of control by the central 
<br>
government or something heard at the local zoning board, is that the present 
<br>
trends of economic growth cannot be sustained over time.
<br>
<p>For example, during his failed presidential campaign, Al Gore repeatedly 
<br>
claimed that the U.S. was rapidly losing farmland and that, if that trend 
<br>
were to continue, we would have to import food and be at the mercy of some 
<br>
sort of culinary OPEC. Gore was not the first person to sound such alarms 
<br>
regarding the disappearing farmland phenomenon; it has been part and parcel 
<br>
of the environmental gospel for many years.
<br>
<p>One gets a mental picture reminiscent of the Animal House band: famished 
<br>
Americans building the last $250,000 house on the last parcel of farmland, 
<br>
with the buyers occupying their new home just before they die of starvation. 
<br>
Yet, this is precisely what many Americans seem to believe, and the problem 
<br>
seems to be getting worse, as more and more local government boards are 
<br>
inundated with &quot;urban planners&quot; who have been saturated with this stuff 
<br>
during their undergraduate and graduate studies. Once indoctrinated, these 
<br>
&quot;planners&quot; then are let loose upon the general public in an effort to 
<br>
convince us that the only way we can enjoy a decent &quot;quality of life&quot; is for 
<br>
government to order our every move.
<br>
<p>One of the things that seems to be &quot;understood&quot; in this sustainable-growth 
<br>
movement is that a price system is meaningless. Prices, in the minds of 
<br>
these planners, are simply arbitrary obstacles to a better life for people. 
<br>
In reality, of course, the outcomes of policies that ignore the price system 
<br>
are  higher prices and a lower standard of living.
<br>
<p>In a free market, prices reflect the demand for a product and its relative 
<br>
scarcity. As competent economists long have noted, prices determine the 
<br>
direction of the market, what will be produced, and how much will be 
<br>
produced. Prices also reflect who is willing to give up the most for these 
<br>
goods. Eliminate a price system, and it is the economic equivalent of a ship 
<br>
trying to sail without a rudder. What remains is chaos.
<br>
<p>California, for example, has attempted to impose &quot;sustainable development&quot; 
<br>
in its policies restricting electricity production. When demand soared even 
<br>
in the face of low production, the California legislature then slapped price 
<br>
controls on the retail sale of electricity. The logical outcomes of such 
<br>
actions are apparent even to those with only a cursory knowledge of 
<br>
economics: Legislatures cannot produce scarce goods like electricity simply 
<br>
by issuing threats.
<br>
<p>A free-market system permits the relative scarcities of goods to be brought 
<br>
in line with the demand for them. The system deals not only with the present 
<br>
but also with the future. Without prices, it is inevitable that a good will 
<br>
be either over- or underutilized. There really is no middle ground.
<br>
<p>Given pressure from consumer/voters, for example, the temptation for 
<br>
government is usually to overutilize a good. That is why people are &quot;loving&quot; 
<br>
national parks to death and why subsidized sugar farmers in Florida have 
<br>
been systematically destroying the Everglades. In both cases, the price 
<br>
system is subordinated to political distribution of goods, and the outcome 
<br>
is always predictable.
<br>
<p>Sustainable-development advocates, however, have also been demanding 
<br>
deliberate underutilization of goods in order to &quot;preserve&quot; things for the 
<br>
&quot;future.&quot; A case in point is the prospect of drilling for oil in the Arctic 
<br>
National Wildlife Reserve. Because the U.S. Government owns the land, it is 
<br>
nearly impossible to make an accurate economic determination of whether or 
<br>
not oil companies should drill for oil there. Ultimately, the decision to 
<br>
drill for oil will be decided by whichever group controls the most votes in 
<br>
Congress.
<br>
<p>Ludwig von Mises understood well the chaos that erupts when government 
<br>
attempts to take control of those processes that are best left to private 
<br>
property and markets. Socialism, he said, is a poor substitute for the free 
<br>
market, and it will quickly break down.
<br>
<p>Those who would advocate sustainable development claim that the free market 
<br>
does not adequately differentiate between present and future needs. 
<br>
Conversely, those same advocates hold that they possess clairvoyance when it 
<br>
comes to understanding the future.
<br>
<p>That, of course, is nonsense. Those blessed with such omniscience certainly 
<br>
have demonstrated their keen gifts by taking full financial advantage of 
<br>
them. Instead, it becomes painfully obvious over time that &quot;sustainable 
<br>
development&quot; is nothing more than yet another ploy for the blind to control 
<br>
the lives of those fortunate enough to still have their eyesight.
