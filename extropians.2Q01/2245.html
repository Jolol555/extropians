<p>Thanks for settling that for us, Samantha.
<br>
<p>Here's yet another theory:
<br>
<p>Our Universe exploded into action after being hit by another, say physicists
<br>

<br>
Exclusive from New Scientist magazine
<br>
It was mighty quiet in our Universe: devoid of all matter and energy. Then
<br>
another universe collided with it. Suddenly space became a searing soup of
<br>
particles and radiation, far hotter and denser than the centre of the Sun.
<br>
This, says a team of physicists, is how the big bang happened. The approach of
<br>
the parallel universe caused the expansion of space and the collision itself
<br>
produced all energy and matter. A comprehensive description of this new theory
<br>
has been submitted to the journal Physical Review D.
<br>
The model is a viable alternative to the theory of cosmic inflation, which was
<br>
cooked up to solve some of the problems of classical big bang theory.
<br>
According to inflation theory, the Universe underwent a brief period of
<br>
exponential expansion in the first split second of its existence. &quot;Our new
<br>
model solves the same problems,&quot; says co-author Paul Steinhardt of Princeton
<br>
University, who was one of the founders of inflation some 20 years ago.
<br>
<p>Brane storm
<br>
So how might this primordial collision have come about? According to the
<br>
theory, our three-dimensional Universe, known as a &quot;3-brane&quot; to cosmologists,
<br>
is just one of the two boundary surfaces of a thin four-dimensional &quot;bulk
<br>
space&quot;, rather like one of the two surfaces of a CD.
<br>
But there was another universe, or bulk brane, inside the bulk space which
<br>
encroached on our boundary brane. When this &quot;brane storm&quot; led to a collision,
<br>
the energy released resulted in the big bang. The authors of the paper dub the
<br>
model the &quot;ekpyrotic universe&quot;, related to the Greek idea of &quot;cosmic fire&quot;.
<br>
Unlike inflation, the brane-storm model fits in neatly with the popular string
<br>
theory of particle physics. &quot;That's one of the exciting things about it,&quot; says
<br>
Neil Turok of Cambridge University, another co-author.
<br>
<p>Big bang II
<br>
&quot;I'm delighted to see an alternative picture for the early Universe,&quot; says
<br>
cosmologist Jim Peebles, also of Princeton. &quot;It has been frustrating to me not
<br>
to have any alternatives to inflation, which I feel has been accepted by many
<br>
cosmologists too easily.&quot;
<br>
As for the credibility of the new model, he says: &quot;I haven't heard my string
<br>
theory colleagues complain. That's a positive sign.&quot;
<br>
But if there are other branes floating around in 4-D bulk space, might we be
<br>
in for another big bang? Turok says it can't be ruled out. Luckily, the fact
<br>
that Newton's gravitational constant doesn't appear to be changing implies
<br>
we're safe from a collision for many billions of years.
