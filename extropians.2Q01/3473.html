First of all, &quot;chick&quot; didn't bother me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But Amara, to be fair to the person who thought women scientists are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unusual, it's *true* to a great extent that they're unusual, 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, unusual, but .. *science fiction* ??
<br>
<p>I worked at NASA-Ames 8 years, and during that time there were at
<br>
least 6 women, in addition to me, working on SETI-related work in my
<br>
division. And that's only one astronomy research deartment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;women in positions of academic power. There are more female scientists now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than there were 25 years ago, but there still aren't very many who have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reached the top such that they're running research programsm heading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;departments and so forth. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeed, and so that's why Jill Tarter, the founder of SETI, is
<br>
held in high esteem in the astronomical community. When that film was
<br>
being made, it was common knowldege that she was one of the role
<br>
models for Carl Sagan's character. This is a pretty easy background
<br>
piece of information to check. See the SETI web site for example.
<br>
<p>The real people who should get credit for that Contact film is: (late)
<br>
Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan, and Linda Obst. Their script is an amazingly
<br>
intelligent piece of work, especially for Hollywood.  The script took
<br>
10 years to be developed, it was very thoughtfully made, in particular
<br>
with respect to how portray the main character. Sagan was very strong
<br>
in supporting women in science, by the way.
<br>
<p>As for numbers of women scientists: I get the idea that very few
<br>
people here have been to scientific conferences. Astronomy is one of
<br>
the subfields of physics that has the largest numbers of them. Please
<br>
go there and do a head count. Women astronomers are not science
<br>
fiction. You can also go to biology conferences, planetary science
<br>
conferences, geology conferences, chemistry conferences, computer
<br>
sciences conferences, etc.etc and find the same.
<br>
<p>And goodness, NASA ADS abstracts is one of the easiest ways to check
<br>
who and what astronomy work is performed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So no one has to tell me anything about being discriminated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against. Believe me, I recognize it when I see it. But I didn't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that sort of thing in the &quot;cool athiest scientist chick&quot; message.
</em><br>
<p>I have my own discrimnation stories, but that was not what I
<br>
was complaining about. I wish the poster had done the background
<br>
work.
<br>
