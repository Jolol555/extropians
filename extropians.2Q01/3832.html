<p>Very decent of you!
<br>
<p>I have two memories, half amusing and half dismaying, of
<br>
situations in which I was the victim of statistical profiling
<br>
in an inconsequential but extremely irritating fashion.
<br>
Both incidents happened sometime in my late teens, and both
<br>
involved accusations of cigarette smoking because, well,
<br>
that's what teenagers do, innit?  I have never in fact smoked
<br>
cigarettes; in fact I've never smoked anything in my life
<br>
**except** pot ;-&gt; (a long time ago).
<br>
<p>The first of these incidents happened when my mother discovered
<br>
cigarette ashes in the bathtub and decided I had taken
<br>
up smoking in the bathroom.  My mother herself smoked like
<br>
a chimney, so if there were any ashes in the bathtub, she
<br>
was herself undoubtedly the source of them.  If I was
<br>
doing anything at that age that caused me to spend a long
<br>
time in the bathroom, it had nothing to do with cigarettes
<br>
&lt;blush&gt;.  The upshot of this was a very surreal, but
<br>
nevertheless acrimonious row with my parents.  (The fact
<br>
that I didn't get into any conventional kinds of trouble
<br>
confused the hell out of my parents and I think was
<br>
actually a source of disappointment to them.)
<br>
<p>The second incident happened during a visit to the dentist.
<br>
I had been going to the same dentist (specializing in
<br>
children's dentistry) since I was a little kid (in early
<br>
days it was just the one guy, but his two younger
<br>
brothers joined the practice when they graduated from
<br>
school).  My parents forked over for orthodontia from
<br>
this guy, too, so I'd been through a lot in that office
<br>
(just the characteristic smell of the Newark [Delaware] Medical
<br>
Building always sent a hot wire straight into my amygdala;
<br>
I've no doubt I would still react strongly to that
<br>
smell).
<br>
<p>Well, one day when I was 18 or so I was there for a regular
<br>
checkup (with one of the two younger brothers), and he noticed
<br>
that there was a lot of staining this time.  Probably this was
<br>
because I had taken to drinking tea, but the dentist immediately
<br>
jumped to the conclusion that I had taken up cigarette smoking.
<br>
When I interrupted the lecture he had launched into on the evils
<br>
of cigarettes to reassure him that I did not in fact
<br>
smoke, he didn't believe me, and he expanded his lecture to
<br>
include his disappointment in the fact that I would attempt
<br>
to lie my way out of his discovery.  I was not only angry
<br>
enough to bite his hand off, I was horrified by his lack of
<br>
professionalism -- his business was to take care of the
<br>
toofies; the health of my lungs and my soul were strictly
<br>
outside his area of expertise (though maybe, being children's
<br>
dentists, they were on some kind of in loco parentis trip;
<br>
I wasn't having any of it).  I was promptly and unceremoniously
<br>
dropped as a patient after that visit, ostensibly because I was
<br>
now too old to be among their clientele, but I suspect it had more
<br>
to do with that confrontation with the younger Dr. C.
<br>
<p>Of course I know that other groups of people in this country
<br>
suffer far more humiliating (and even life-threatening) consequences
<br>
from their Bayesian correlates -- I now live in the state of
<br>
New Jersey, which has been caught in a scandal in recent years
<br>
having to do with certain groups of people being pulled over and
<br>
harrassed by the state police on the New Jersey Turnpike and
<br>
elsewhere based on statistical profiling.  Nevertheless, I
<br>
always grind my teeth in response to sanctimonious propaganda
<br>
about the evils of &quot;stereotyping&quot; -- **everybody** stereotypes;
<br>
it's just another word for guessing probabilities based on
<br>
incomplete information, and sizing up situations quickly
<br>
using rough-and-ready rules of thumb.  If people sometimes
<br>
get pinched by the Procrustean beds nailed together for them
<br>
by other people's Bayesian calculations, those are the breaks.
<br>
But DON&quot;T LET IT HAPPEN TO ME!! :-&lt;  :-&lt;
<br>
