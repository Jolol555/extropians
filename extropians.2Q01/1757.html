<p>&lt;&lt; And that would be an oversimplification of Edelman's position, too,
<br>
&nbsp;I think.  I don't think you can throw out Edelman's whole argument
<br>
&nbsp;because of his infelicitous characterization of the resolution
<br>
&nbsp;of analog signals and processing elements as &quot;unlimited&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;However, since you seem to agree that it's a good idea to actually
<br>
&nbsp;look at brains in detail to see how they work, rather than ignoring
<br>
&nbsp;them completely and just trying to write programs to try to duplicate
<br>
&nbsp;their input/output functions at the highest level of abstraction,
<br>
&nbsp;I guess there's really no conflict, anyway.

Not to be a dick, but I have Edelmann's &amp; Tonini's A Universe Of 
<br>
Consciousness, as well as Stewart Kaufman's Investigations. Both of these 
<br>
works leave a lot to be desired.  They are not as physicalist as I feel they 
<br>
need to be, such as Moravec or R. Michael Perry, or Tipler'a books. These 
<br>
essays are thought provoking, but seem to yield very little concrete 
<br>
understanding for the reader, and are murky where they would want their 
<br>
sciences to go, and what they wish to find out. Disappointing, especially in 
<br>
regards the premise of this thread.
