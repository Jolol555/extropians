<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; Humility? The ability to tell the difference between science fiction &amp;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are megatons of scientists who would deride many of the insights and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals of Extropianism, out of hand, no humility involved. They would simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; label it as scifi.  Not fair, but I believe that's a fact. They would dismiss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all 'possibility' also.
</em><br>
<p>As the little ;-) at the end of my post indicates, I was trying to be funny,
<br>
though I guess I was half-serious. Sorry if I came off as negative or derisive.
<br>
My call for humility is a reflection of my own sense of wonder when I consider
<br>
the mere existence of the universe (who needs a God when you've got all this?).
<br>
If and when we become god-like and can take the universe for granted (if we ever
<br>
can), we'll be so far removed from what we are now that trying to imagine what
<br>
this will be like seems better relegated to science fiction &amp; daydreams. Our
<br>
current limited perspectives will always cloud the picture. I'm more interested
<br>
in the practical steps that can be taken now to lay the groundwork for what is
<br>
to come (or what could come). It seems to me that we could easily lose sight of
<br>
these goals by getting caught up in the &quot;magic&quot; and just assuming all will be
<br>
well when &quot;it&quot; happens (sounds like religion).
