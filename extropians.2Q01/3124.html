<p><em>&gt; To the apparently few actual Extropians (the capital &quot;E&quot; ones, you know

</em><br>
<p>You know, not so very long ago (mere weeks, in fact), I would
<br>
have taken a blast like this very much to heart myself, checking
<br>
my fly, running to the mirror to see if green stuff was stuck between
<br>
my teeth, and in general angsting about whether I had any business
<br>
&quot;bothering the grownups&quot; of this august company.
<br>
<p>Now I'm more inclined to shake my head at the crude attempt to use
<br>
this sort of generalized guilt as a tool of intimidation, rather than
<br>
some more entertaining and enlightening form of social control
<br>
(argument, anyone?  wit?  humor?).
<br>
<p>I have never, in fact, called myself either an extropian or an
<br>
Extropian, and I think one of the great things about this list is
<br>
that it's not necessary for me to do so in order to post here.  If I had
<br>
to sign something equivalent to the Thirty-Nine Articles in order to
<br>
participate here, I'd be gone.

<p><em>&gt; ...I've been told on more than one occasion by some of my most cherished

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I honestly don't understand why Max More and Greg Burch aren't panicking
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In off-list correspondence, I recently commented to someone how grateful
<br>
I was to Max for not slapping me down for some of my more off-the-wall
<br>
posts to the Extropians.  My correspondent replied that I clearly didn't
<br>
understand how the list works -- that Max is, by and large, a &quot;deus
<br>
absconditus&quot; who almost never intervenes, content-wise, unless things
<br>
degenerate into the sort of repetitive rant exemplified by the periodic
<br>
outbreaks on the subject of gun control.
<br>
<p>I'm a little dismayed by your control-freaky attitude, Eliezer -- if
<br>
nothing else, it's a waste of energy.  You already have a little
<br>
corner of the Internet where you can be god-emperor -- your SL4 and
<br>
Singularitarians' lists.  You sound like a print magazine editor
<br>
two or three times your age harrumphing about competition from
<br>
&quot;irresponsible&quot; journalists on the Web (like the editors of some
<br>
hi-fi magazines I read).
<br>
<p>My friend F, by the way, subscribed to the Extropians' for a while,
<br>
and had to unsubscribe because of the sheer volume.  He didn't say
<br>
anything about 'unintelligent babble' -- it was just more than
<br>
he cared to wade through every day, especially since he participates
<br>
in other lists.  I still forward stuff to him that I think he might
<br>
be interested in.
<br>
<p>And again the broadly-directed elitist swipe -- this business about
<br>
&quot;cherished subscribers ... with major identities outside [the list]&quot;.
<br>
What the hell does that mean?  They have Nobels, Pulitzers?  They've
<br>
been on the cover of _Time_?  They've been interviewed by Barbara
<br>
Walters?  Damien Broderick has a substantial presence in the
<br>
memesphere outside this list, but he's never used it as an excuse
<br>
to intimidate or bully anybody, and he's willing to deal with
<br>
people on the basis of the content of their posts **to this list**,
<br>
without sniffing around to see Who's Who.  You know, the real
<br>
Somebodies of the world probably don't have a lot of time to spend
<br>
on the Internet, and the ones that do either have to do it anonymously
<br>
(can you imagine Bill Gates posting to this list under his own name?)
<br>
or by means of forums with the requisite amount of privacy and
<br>
exclusivity (like your own Singularitarians' list, n'est-ce pas?).
<br>
<p>Take a hint from Clay Shirky (&quot;In Praise of Evolvable Systems&quot;,
<br>
<a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html">http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html</a> ):
<br>
&quot;The effects of this ease of implementation... are twofold: a huge increase
<br>
in truly pointless and stupid content soaking up bandwidth; and, as a
<br>
direct result, a rush to find ways to compete with all the noise through
<br>
the creation of interesting work. The quality of the best work on the Web
<br>
today has not happened in spite of the mass of garbage out there,
<br>
but in part because of it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ah, but then you've decided that evolution is a dangerous process.
<br>
Pity.
<br>
