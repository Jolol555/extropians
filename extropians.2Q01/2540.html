</em><br>
<p>No, certainly not on extropians.  But I think that the
<br>
issue isn't so simple, at least it never has been for
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>As societies evolve in any kind of competitive milieu
<br>
it seems natural for a certain amount of xenophobia to
<br>
develop.  This xenophobia---or rather *wariness* of
<br>
strangers rather than fear---is the means by which a
<br>
tribe gains integrity.  So you would expect successful
<br>
cultures or societies, at  least those with noticeable
<br>
historical impact, to practice a certain amount of
<br>
patriotism, or ethnic pride, or whatever kind of
<br>
glue, to hold them together and prevent a decrease
<br>
in numbers or influence.
<br>
<p>In societies such as the United States, which were
<br>
relatively homogenous for most of their history and
<br>
with no large hostile foreign nations nearby, the
<br>
xenophobic instinct clearly atrophies, whereas in
<br>
some smaller countries, e.g. France or Germany,
<br>
closely surrounded by &quot;different&quot; groups, a tribal
<br>
consciousness tends to fair much better over the
<br>
long run.
<br>
<p>In a certain way, continuing to speak of nations, tribes,
<br>
and groups rather than of individuals, nature corrects
<br>
for this over time.  Consider what is happening in
<br>
Sweden for instance, where there has obviously been
<br>
great tolerance for diversity:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for diversity, at least Stockholm is rapidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaching the diversity I have seen in my visits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the states.  In fact, Stockholm is almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming a different country from Sweden - which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might actually be a return to its old status as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign city :-)
</em><br>
<p>There are only about eight million people in Sweden,
<br>
and it can easily occur that, forbidding the occurrence
<br>
of singularities and all, what was the group that 
<br>
identified itself as &quot;the Swedish people&quot; will cease
<br>
to exist.  Likewise in America, nature is correcting
<br>
for the (mostly benign) lack of xenophobia here; it
<br>
is estimated that by 2040 or so white people will be
<br>
a minority.  In California, white children are already
<br>
not the largest, but only the second largest minority.
<br>
<p>I have always had very mixed feelings about this 
<br>
because on the one hand I feel like a defector if
<br>
I don't support policies that would tend to make
<br>
**whatever** group I'm a part of prosper at the
<br>
expense of other **groups**.  Inculcating its young
<br>
with a group identity is an ESS.  I note with some
<br>
respect that Hispanics in California have
<br>
significantly more cohesion than do other groups,
<br>
even though I, on the other hand, will not argue for
<br>
a minute that such loyalties do anything for us as
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>In a fascinating book &quot;Tribes&quot;, by Joel Kotkin, the
<br>
author describes how various ethnic tribes around
<br>
the world---from the overseas Chinese to the Jews
<br>
---enormously facilitate trade.  But it also becomes
<br>
very clear that what makes this possible is the
<br>
non-assimilation memes that these groups possess.
<br>
He even describes Mormons in this vein, admiring
<br>
their industriousness and birth-rate along with
<br>
the other larger tribes.
<br>
<p>Evolution has a final solution for groups that
<br>
lack at least a trace of xenophobia.
