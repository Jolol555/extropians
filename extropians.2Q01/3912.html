<em>&gt; Well, here's what Bertrand Russell had to say about that (from &quot;Speaking Personally:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bertrand Russell&quot;, a 1961 John Chandos interview originally released on a two-disc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LP set, Riverside 7014, 7015):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5.  Background to National Greatness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RUSSELL:  What sort of conditions cause a nation to produce great men?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I've always maintained that Shakespeare would never have written his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff if it hadn't been for our defeating the Armada.  I believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of sense of successful energy that we got from that was essential to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the greatness of the Elizabethan age.  That's very disputable; it's only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hypothesis.  I don't think it's very easy to say, but it seems to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking over history, that countries which have been politically powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then ceased to be, do lose culturally.  People who might be culturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great cease to have the self-confidence that is necessary.  Because to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything great you have to have **enormous** self-confidence:  'Well, I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this whatever people say...'  because **everybody** will say you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong!
</em><br>
<p><p>The way I think of it is this.  Those who are both really bright and who
<br>
deeply care about changing the world for the better must learn to stand
<br>
regardless of the opposition.  For they know that there are no others
<br>
who
<br>
will do what could be done to improve the world better than they if they
<br>
default.   It is not a matter of simple self-confidence but of knowing
<br>
that the world and our future is in their hands and on their shoulders.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The man who thinks originally has at all times I think, in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country and in all ages, been exposed to persecution.  Buffon, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributed enormously to zoology and geology, was compelled by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorbonne solemnly to withdraw the opinion that some of the mountains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that now exist did not exist when the world was older.  And Vesalius,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who first dissected bodies for medical reasons, was sentenced to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and lost his life through shipwreck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the way home.  And Galileo, we know, was condemned by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inquisition.  And in general you may say that great innovators,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the most part, have suffered...  Einstein, of course, had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave Germany.  And... it's the fate of them, but they think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthwhile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that liberty, in many of its forms, is almost bound to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than it was in the 19th century or in the later parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 18th.  You cannot do your work as an individual, unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen to be something like a poet or a...  well, it's no good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a composer, because then you'd have to get people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform your music.  But a poet can be an individual still.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But most people can't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Or a theoretician or the center of a small web of extremely competent
<br>
hackers or one who weaves and starts the dissemination of a new
<br>
worldview.  It is simply incorrect to assume that nothing can be done
<br>
without having a large part of society behind you or that the amount of
<br>
society necessary to an enterprise cannot be motivated by the one or the
<br>
few. 
<br>
<p>I love Russell, but he was often (with some cause) very cynical.
