<p>Put down that ring, Bilbo Baggins. I know it's round, golden and shiny,

your very soul, and slowly, imperceptibly draw you to Redmond, where you

will dwell henceforth, bound, until the sun burns out and the stars fall

from heavens. Do you really, really want that?

</em><br>
<p>Yes!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would strongly recommend learning Ruby.  It is relatively little known

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I would argue against Ruby. Not because it's a bad language, it certainly
<br>
is nice, but it does not have any extra advantages, to learn something
<br>
with very little code base and community support. There's a reason why
<br>
Python is said to come with &quot;batteries included&quot;. This is not true for
<br>
Ruby. The situation is clearly different to Perl vs. Python.
<br>
<p>Btw, I don't condone language wars, but I can't resist posting the
<br>
following delicious bit of net.humor (ask Google for attribution):
<br>
<p>EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH--DAY
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many thick vines that grow in the swamp until he reaches the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagobah statistics lab. Panting heavily, he continues his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exercises--grepping, installing new packages, logging in as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root, and writing replacements for two-year-old shell scripts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Python.
<br>
<p>YODA: Code!  Yes.  A programmer's strength flows from code
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintainability.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beware of Perl.  Terse syntax... more than one way to do it...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default variables.  The dark side of code maintainability are they.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easily they flow, quick to join you when code you write.  If once
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consume you it will.
<br>
<p>LUKE: Is Perl better than Python?
<br>
<p>YODA: No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, more seductive.
<br>
<p>LUKE: But how will I know why Python is better than Perl?
<br>
<p>YODA: You will know.  When your code you try to read six months from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I used to recommend (back in the early 80s) that people start with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smalltalk as a pure OO language with an excellent working environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrivaled in IDEs even today.  I would still recommend it or Ruby for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really learning OO for the first time.  I still think it is a really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine candidate.  A well designed free Smalltalk can be obtained at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.squeak.org">http://www.squeak.org</a>.
</em><br>
<p>I would have recommended Scheme for the same reason. However, I explicity
<br>
recommended Python, because of availability of literature, support and
<br>
code base.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Program in something that lets your mind sing and opens your head to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own brillance without bogging you down in language idiosyncrasies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you want to be expert in the vagaries of some language or do you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand and partake of the art and joy of programming?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I would suggest not to become a programmer, if you can avoid it.
