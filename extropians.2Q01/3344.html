<p>What exactly is wrong with tact? How do you expect reasonable people to listen

to anything you have to say if you disrespect them? This should work here as
<br>
well as in &quot;RL.&quot;

<p>How is not being nice or offensive extropic? (Seems more entropic to me.) What
<br>
is your definition of &quot;newbie&quot;? Anyone who isn't exactly like you? And are you
<br>
serious about trying to convert people? Wow. I never thought of transhumanism
<br>
or extropianism as cults, but your statement certainly makes them sound that
<br>
way. Maybe it's not the ideas certain people are having trouble dealing with,
<br>
Brian. Maybe it's your rhetorical style.
<br>
<p>Just a thought.
