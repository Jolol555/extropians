<p><em>&gt; How do you detect consciousness?

<p>I don't know.  If there isn't an obvious objective definition of

<p>Some people would say yes - while substituting an outcome-dependent
<br>
variable for &quot;Eliezer Yudkowsky&quot;, of course - but I think they're wrong. 
<br>
I think morality (Friendliness) can be grounded in panhuman affectors and
<br>
created using a convergent method that is insensitive to details of the
<br>
creating programmer's personality.  I do consider myself one of the better
<br>
sources of theoretical knowledge about how that type of morality might
<br>
work.  Hence the &quot;commandments&quot;, as you call my best guesses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is simply a historical fact about the causal origins of a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent entity.  Creators are not entirely powerless; they have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; control over *what* is created; but once created, the creation is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizen, and independent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, so it's not a rule you're laying down, but a fact. So if you're wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and simulated entities *can* be controlled, then you don't have a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that?
</em><br>
<p>No, they're rules.  They become facts, within a region, if implemented
<br>
within that region by an OS-type superintelligence capable of doing so.  I
<br>
would like a friendlier Universe to be implemented in as wide a region as
<br>
possible; this solar system at the least.  Such a superintelligence would
<br>
regard your creation of another citizen as a historical fact which does
<br>
not morally impinge on further volitional interactions between you and
<br>
that citizen; that's my best guess, at least.
