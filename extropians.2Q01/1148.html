I have recently gotten my own hardcover copy of &quot;the Spike&quot; by Damien and I am EXTREMELY impressed by it.  His intelligence and sense of humor really shines throughout, making it a very fun read.  I always wanted a book which covered in detail the many fascinating topics we discuss here and I now have it.
<br>
<p>Where did Damien often turn to illuminate points in his book?  To a number of members on this very list!  It makes sense to me considering some of the gifted minds here and the quality of some of the posts.  Damien dwells on the list to the point where I thought the book's subtitle should have been, &quot;a loveletter to the extrolist and it's membership!&quot; : )  
<br>
<p>The original version of this book came out in Australia in 1996 but sadly did not make it to the United States.  Alot of technological progress has occurred since then.  But, not to worry, Damien has greatly updated and rewritten the book to keep well abreast of things. 
<br>
<p>I hope literally EVERYONE on this list purchases a copy of the book.  Both because it is an excellent read and as a show of loyalty to a gifted writer among us.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John Grigg
