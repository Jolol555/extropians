<em>&gt; &gt; The notions that in &quot;heaven&quot; one

<p>The Seventh Day Adventist prophet Ellen White had a vision
<br>
of heaven which deals with the boredom problem.  In her
<br>
description, heaven was much more earthlike than the other
<br>
versions of heaven: no harps, no floating around on clouds,
<br>
etc.  Hers was a heaven which had an actual planet (a new
<br>
earth), made of atoms, a gravity field etc.  The inhabitants
<br>
were all farmers.  (I swear Im not making this up.)  Except
<br>
they all had really good farms, which produced really good
<br>
food and few weeds, mild climate, like the original garden
<br>
of Eden.  I guess she thought farming wasnt boring.  Or
<br>
wouldnt become boring, even after infinitely many years.  spike
