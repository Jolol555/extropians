<em>&gt; &gt;I have wondered for quite a while, just how boycotting &quot;exploited&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people's  goods, say, Nike shoes, because they are made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;underpaid&quot; children, is a good thing for us to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You find exploited child labor acceptable?
</em><br>
<p>As a 15 year old boy, I worked for the laundry company owned by a
<br>
neighbor. Not a cushy job either, I worked night shift, for minimum
<br>
wage, loading and emptying huge dryers capable of holding 300 lbs of
<br>
laundry at a time. Hot work, no air conditioning. Not a fun job. Not
<br>
once did I feel 'exlpoited', outside of being miffed at not being
<br>
allowed to work more than 8 hours a day...
<br>
<p>As for abuse, while the neighbor was a freind of my parents, and I went
<br>
to school with his kids, he was a real pain in the butt. Late in the
<br>
summer, I wanted to take a week off to vacation with the family. He said
<br>
no, so I quit on him.
<br>
<p>My next employer owned a farmers market. The sign on his door said,&quot;We'd
<br>
like to pay you what you are worth, but minimum wage laws make us pay
<br>
you more.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ditto &quot;sweatshops&quot;. If the choice is between a twelve hour work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;shift six days a week, and starvation, I would gladly work those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hours. ( I tend to do this anyway, but then, I am my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;exploiter&quot;!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a pittance of a wage and a great deal of abuse? I doubt your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case is even remotely applicable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Even though these children are &quot;exploited&quot; by the standards of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;America, they may well be the difference between their familys'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;survival and slow death by starvation. Unless the boycotters are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;willing to pay the now unemployed kids' families the difference,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they may be causing more suffering than they are curing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that they have little choice doesnt make it right. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchasing these goods you are ethically the same as the sweatshop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boss who mistreats these children.
</em><br>
<p>So in the two cases above of my first two jobs, was I 'exploited'? Was
<br>
it unethical for people to buy the product of my labor?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;Exploitation&quot; of a country's citizens is the province of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;country's citizens and government. Unless you advocate that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;invade, overthrow, and magically raise the standards of living in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all impoverished areas, anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That would make me the jingoist Hal's accusing me of being. To buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these goods is to make yourself the ethical partner of those who do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exploiting.
</em><br>
<p>So if I bought produce from the same farmer's market that 'exploited'
<br>
me, does that make me unethical?
