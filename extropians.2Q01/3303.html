</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>To learn to program, you need to learn several languages, not because
<br>
you will use them all but because they train you in the programming
<br>
mindset. While we are using java here at the Institute for beginners, it
<br>
is clear that it has a somewhat higher threshold than the scheme and
<br>
pascal we used before. I would suggest starting out by playing with
<br>
scheme, then moving on to java.
<br>
<p>Taking a look at starlogo might also be fun - a very simple and easy
<br>
language, which helps learn about distributed agents, exactly the thing
<br>
to learn when nanotech programmers become necessary. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth trying to catch up to the cutting edge of development considering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pace that this edge keeps growing? What might be some ways to help other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then programming? Thanks!
</em><br>
<p>Somehow I doubt the singularity will occur before you have learned C or
<br>
become a proficient programmer :-)
<br>
<p>I think this meme that the cutting edge is racing ahead faster than you
<br>
can learn is very dangerous. In many areas it is patently untrue, and if
<br>
it discourages people from joining there is a very real chance the field
<br>
will not be able to expand far enough.
<br>
<p>Unlike some others on the list, I think the Singularity will not be a
<br>
question of a tiny cabal in a basement inventing a big AI, but rather a
<br>
global transition. It will take far more than programmers to bring it
<br>
about: we need investors, philosophers, biochemists, engineers,
<br>
politicians, artists, neuroscientists, reviewers, physicists, lawyers...
<br>
- the list just goes on.
