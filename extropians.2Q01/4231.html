I apologize for free-associating from one small phrase in Nick's message:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because of accelerating technological progress, humankind may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly approaching a critical phase in its career.
</em><br>
<p>I read &quot;critical phase&quot; and it reminded me of two phenomena: phase
<br>
transitions, and critical points, both of which are thermodynamic concepts
<br>
governing the behavior of solids, liquids and gases.
<br>
<p>I wonder if we could be said to be approaching a phase transition?
<br>
Perhaps our concept of the Singularity could be said to represent a
<br>
phase transition in human affairs.  We could be moving from a solid to
<br>
a liquid, or a liquid to a gas.  The new state would be characterized
<br>
by having many more degrees of freedom.
<br>
<p>How much more can we milk out of this somewhat ill-fitting analogy?
<br>
When phase transitions occur, they often start at an interface between
<br>
the two phases, which then grows, one phase gaining at the expense of
<br>
the others.  Think of bubbles at the bottom of a pan growing as molecules
<br>
transition from the liquid to the gas phase until the bubble breaks free.
<br>
<p>In this model, the Singularity would start with a small group and then
<br>
expand, more and more people being invited (or compelled) to join,
<br>
each undergoing a sudden transition, a Vastening.
<br>
<p>We could even think of this rather literally, a nucleation site which
<br>
is a source of knowledge, people clustering around it and gaining the
<br>
knowledge needed to Transcend, then breaking free like a bubble and they
<br>
are gone, waiting for the next group to undergo the same sequence of
<br>
steps.  This is something like Vinge's scenario in Marooned in Realtime.
<br>
<p>I'm trying to work the critical point into this imagery.  It is the
<br>
point at which the distinction between water and gas becomes moot.  See
<br>
<a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/phchem/deiters/persons/globass/critical.html">http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/phchem/deiters/persons/globass/critical.html</a>.
<br>
<p>This might represent a &quot;soft&quot; transition to a Singularity.  Rather than
<br>
a specific interface with people on one side or the other, we instead
<br>
have gradual increases without any sharp, well-defined transition,
<br>
until suddenly, to our surprise, we find ourselves having Transcended so
<br>
gradually that we never noticed.  In the diagram above, we'd take a path
<br>
which circles around the critical point, the liquid-to-gas line endpoint,
<br>
something like the dotted arrows shown.  We'd go from one phase to the
<br>
other without transition.
