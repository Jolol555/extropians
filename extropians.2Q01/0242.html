<em>&gt; Because the entertainment industry has for its purpose the making of money

</em><br>
<p>This is a rather large and bothersome question, and unlike some other
<br>
large questions, has been something that many of the people I know,
<br>
especially those with kids, have had to deal with personally.
<br>
<p>The brightest person I know, who is now in the first half of his
<br>
seventh decade, has, since long before I got to know him 25 years ago,
<br>
held the opinion that industrialized entertainment (in particular
<br>
movies, TV, and the recorded music business) is nothing less than
<br>
a legalized form of drug pushing, like the cigarette industry.  It
<br>
gets people hooked on its product at an early age, robs them of the
<br>
capacity to produce their own entertainments (because its high-gloss
<br>
professionalism, like the taste of refined sugar compared to that
<br>
of a piece of fruit, cannot compete with the cruder product), siphons
<br>
money from its users all their lives, and ultimately rots their
<br>
brains.  This gentleman grew up in a household in which parental
<br>
opinion was that movies are only for people who are too stupid
<br>
to read books, and he has never owned a television set.  For the
<br>
past 15 years, &quot;Internet&quot; for him has meant &quot;Usenet&quot; almost
<br>
exclusively; he only switched from Lynx to a mainstream browser
<br>
last year, and he still finds the Web rather off-putting because
<br>
of what he perceives as an uncomfortable similarity to commercial
<br>
TV.
<br>
<p>Two other friends, of my own generation (and who have themselves been
<br>
best friends with each other since childhood), each have a son and
<br>
a daughter.  One of these gentlemen has an opinion of mass
<br>
entertainment similar to that of my older friend.  His kids will
<br>
probably read Homer in Greek before they ever see an episode of
<br>
_Star Trek_.  The other friend is a great aficionado of the media,
<br>
loves old movies and vintage TV shows, and delights in sharing these
<br>
pleasures with his kids.  Those kids are well versed in _Trek_
<br>
culture.
<br>
<p>So what would *I* do if I had kids?  Major dilemma.  I have a fair
<br>
amount of sympathy for my older friend's drug-addiction model of
<br>
high-tech entertainment (though I was myself hooked long before I
<br>
ever thought about such things), but I have no idea what could be
<br>
or should be done about it, apart from a personal choice of
<br>
&quot;relinquishment&quot; for oneself (and one's kids?  I don't know!) such
<br>
as he has made.  In a free-market economy, given the average
<br>
human's sweet tooth for storytelling and music, and the technology
<br>
that makes possible the high-gloss production and mass replication
<br>
of entertainment, you get Hollywood et al.  In Britain, where the
<br>
government has more control of these things, at least there's the
<br>
BBC (though the BBC is often a step above what Dwight MacDonald called
<br>
&quot;masscult&quot; in his 1960 essay &quot;Masscult and Midcult&quot;, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306802058/qid=983939657/sr=1-9/ref=sc_b_9/102-1083400-8739317">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0306802058/qid=983939657/sr=1-9/ref=sc_b_9/102-1083400-8739317</a>
<br>
it certainly doesn't rise above the level of &quot;midcult&quot;).  If I
<br>
had kids, I would probably adopt a laissez-faire approach just to
<br>
keep life livable, sharing with them as many of the things I liked
<br>
as they showed a taste for, and leaving the rest to chance and
<br>
the public school system.  But not without a twinge of guilt.
<br>
<p>People on this list sometimes speculate about intelligence
<br>
amplification in terms of enhancing memory to facilitate rapidity
<br>
of learning, or quickness and reliability of recall, and so on.
<br>
However, it occurs to me that if a technology were ever developed
<br>
of directly and effectively controlling human **motivation**, it
<br>
would have an equally enormous effect.  Creating a specific
<br>
&quot;mania&quot; in a schoolchild for the current item in the curriculum,
<br>
eclipsing all other interests for an arbitrary duration, might
<br>
have the effect of shifting the entire Gaussian IQ curve upward
<br>
by 50 points (imagine what we'd all look like if we jumped out of
<br>
bed each morning just itching to get to the gym).  I guess such
<br>
a technology would be similar to the fictional &quot;Focus&quot; technique
<br>
which Vernor Vinge imagined in _A Deepness In The Sky_.  Perhaps,
<br>
post Singularity, we'll all spend much of our time in a state of
<br>
blissfully preoccupied Focus (but not all of the time --
<br>
there will no doubt be a recognition of the need for undirected
<br>
play and &quot;timewasting&quot; simply as a source of spontaneous variation
<br>
and creativity).
<br>
<p>In the meantime, there's a huge amount of unharnessed intellectual
<br>
potential and wasted productivity in the human noosphere, and
<br>
a good deal of this is due to people's motivational hooks being
<br>
left free to latch onto such timewasters as football and
<br>
_Star Trek_ :-&gt;.
