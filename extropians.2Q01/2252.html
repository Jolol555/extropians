<p>This matches the model of the company my partner and I are running.  We got
<br>
distracted for a few years working for IBM and the big e-Companies, but now
<br>
we are focusing on our own small consulting business again.  My partner is
<br>
the CEO and runs the company from a spare bedroom converted to an office.  I
<br>
also have a bedroom office for work at home and rent hotel space when I am
<br>
on the road.  Our startup costs included a laptop and desktop computer for
<br>
each of our three employees.  We outsource our payroll services, tax
<br>
accounting, network services, website hosting, etc.  We are offering the
<br>
same services we used to offer through the big names, only now under our own
<br>
name at half the hourly rate.
<br>
<p>We originally looked at resuming contract work as a way to fill in until we
<br>
got &quot;regular&quot; jobs again.  We have been so swamped for contractors, and the
<br>
pay is so high, that we won't consider returning to a big company now.  I
<br>
really do think this is the wave of the future.
<br>
<p>If we didn't have family ties in Florida, I would even consider minimizing
<br>
our household effects and live only in temporary rented locations, moving
<br>
around wherever the work is.  We have friends all over the country (USA) and
<br>
most of our work is online.  We can work anywhere using our own laptops and
<br>
use the Internet everywhere to access our servers which are outsourced at an
<br>
ISP location.  There is no need to own a home or live in a single location,
<br>
except as a personal preference.
