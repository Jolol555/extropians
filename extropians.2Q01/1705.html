<p>Well, yes, but even putting it that way seems to me disrespectful. This
<br>
person is making a point that might in principle have the power to
<br>
influence us, if careful scrutiny corroborated it. (I am making no such
<br>
claim, of course.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The core of the confused mail seems to be that 1)

<em>&gt;being a cyborg is not fun, 
</em><br>
<p>Although this is what is literally said (in frail non-native English), I
<br>
don't think it conveys what is intended.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2) extropianism seeks to turn everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into cyborgs.
</em><br>
<p>This seems to me a partial misreading. 
<br>
<p>Here's a quick shot at reading it sympathetically:
<br>
<p>======================
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Youa are mad, if you think tha it's good to be a cyborg.If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;you want to be do it yourself, but don't give the chance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;other people, who don't know what to do with their lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;and they think it's fun.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to become a cyborg yourself, do so, your values are obviously
<br>
deranged anyway. But please keep the technology to yourselves, because
<br>
there are vulnerable people out there, the same ones who kill themselves
<br>
with heroin in a foolish search for diversion from what, sadly, they see as
<br>
a meaningless and hopeless life. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Because IT'S NOT! Whay do everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;wants to be a computer? 
</em><br>
<p>This `cyborg' choice, like drug or gambling addiction , is NOT a fun
<br>
alternative to living a complex human life, learning to deal with
<br>
frustration and pain and the risks of love in the way that only a human
<br>
being can, unlike a programmed computer--it's life as what Phil Dick called
<br>
an `electric ant', pre-programmed and meaningless. Yet people keeping
<br>
trying to vitiate their rich humanity and replace senstitive awareness and
<br>
choice with stupor or mechanical `canned' routines? Why? Why?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Why do everyone tries to put an end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;to humanity? 
</em><br>
<p>In promoting this terrible anti-human choice, in helping make it possible
<br>
for people to believe that it's better to be a machine than a person, you
<br>
collude with those who would destroy humanity. Why? Why? What the hell's
<br>
*wrong* with you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;I can't really understand, but you will win!
</em><br>
<p>Your self-destructive project will defeat every softer alternative, just as
<br>
heavy tanks crush soft human bodies and seductive but wicked ideas seduce
<br>
generation after generation into ruin. It's beyond comprehension that we
<br>
remain so susceptible to the lure of the death-lovers, but we do, and you
<br>
will win, you damned maniacs. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;You idiot! Bye!
</em><br>
<p>==============
<br>
<p>I think this cry of pain and rage must be met with a considered reply, one
<br>
that points out that (for example) enhancement of current human capacities
<br>
is NOT the same as repudiation of human decencies, of love, of all those
<br>
values typically and often legitimately seen as threatened by
<br>
`mechanisation', `global rationality', etc. That the values and schemes
<br>
advanced by transhumanists are an *extension* of what now makes us
<br>
conscious, conscienced beings, not its *denial*. This is by no means
<br>
self-evident. A lot of hard work remains to be done.
