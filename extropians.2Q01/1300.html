<p>Hmmm, I would prefer an asteroid first (perhaps one of low density
<br>
that might be a burned out comet).  I'm not positive but I think
<br>
in general comets have higher velocities.  So they may be harder
<br>
to get to than NEOs.  The trick is to find the NEOs whose orbits
<br>
are in resonance with ours so you have periodic short-flight
<br>
opportunities (like we do with Mars).  Then you can shuttle back
<br>
and forth between the asteroid and the ISS (with your harvested
<br>
materials) [like the fuel they need to boost the orbit].
<br>
<p>There is no way a 10-100 kg satellite is going to be able
<br>
to navigate a big comet/asteroid back to orbit around the
<br>
Earth.  The trick is to figure out how to get the exponential
<br>
growth going *without* waving the magic wand of nanotech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; THe other option is to go straight to the asteroid with a 10 kg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicator that has 2 kg worth of solar cells (included). The replicator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is programmed to construct tiny mass accelerators with solar panels all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the surface, all interlinked in a neural network.
</em><br>
<p>It isn't clear to me whether we are going to be able to do &quot;micro&quot;
<br>
scale replicators anytime soon.  I've yet to be introduced to
<br>
an individual like Eli who understands ME sufficiently that they
<br>
can design self-replicating MEMS scale 'factories'.  It isn't
<br>
stamping out the parts that is the problem so much as the
<br>
self-assembly.  Divide &amp; conquer as they say.  Let the materials
<br>
brought back to ISS pay for the semi-automated macro-scale
<br>
Asteroid Robotic Harvester assembler to be installed on the ISS.
<br>
I'm sure you could design one of these and have it fit in one
<br>
of those Italian Moving Vans they've designed for shuttling
<br>
back and forth.
