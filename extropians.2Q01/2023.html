<p><em>&gt;Unsustainable Predictions
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;by William L. Anderson
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;[Posted April 3, 2001]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;One of the things that seems to be &quot;understood&quot; in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sustainable-growth movement is that a price system is meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Prices, in the minds of these planners, are simply arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obstacles to a better life for people. In reality, of course, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outcomes of policies that ignore the price system are  higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prices and a lower standard of living.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that this is what they &quot;understand&quot; at all. I believe
<br>
what they are saying is that the current market system ignores
<br>
costs that would reduce it's profits. In other words they are not
<br>
paying the real world costs at all.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In a free market, prices reflect the demand for a product and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relative scarcity. As competent economists long have noted, prices
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determine the direction of the market, what will be produced, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how much will be produced. Prices also reflect who is willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give up the most for these goods. Eliminate a price system, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is the economic equivalent of a ship trying to sail without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rudder. What remains is chaos.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but since the market is reluctant to pay all the costs
<br>
involved, this leaves a niche for government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A free-market system permits the relative scarcities of goods to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be brought in line with the demand for them. The system deals not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only with the present but also with the future. Without prices, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is inevitable that a good will be either over- or underutilized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There really is no middle ground.
</em><br>
<p>The current market deals in a much shorter timeframe than is
<br>
currently socially acceptable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Ludwig von Mises understood well the chaos that erupts when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government attempts to take control of those processes that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best left to private property and markets. Socialism, he said, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a poor substitute for the free market, and it will quickly break
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Those who would advocate sustainable development claim that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free market does not adequately differentiate between present and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future needs. Conversely, those same advocates hold that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possess clairvoyance when it comes to understanding the future.
</em><br>
<p>With the creation of futures, some of these issues are being
<br>
addressed. I would argue that it makes good economic sense to have
<br>
a much greater timeframe involved.
