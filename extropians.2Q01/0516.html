<em>&gt;Very interesting, although a bit &quot;iffy&quot; (21 &quot;if&quot;s!).  I was looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through some of my old extropian files last night and Lee Corbin raised
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a similar question back in February 1996, in a thread titled &quot;The VR
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Solipsist&quot;.  Unfortunately the extropy.org archives don't go back that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;far so I have included his message below [1].
</em><br>
<p>Thanks - Lee did indeed take the idea seriously, though I think I disagree
<br>
with some of his assessments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The problem with these kinds of speculations is that they hinge so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much on the desires and motivations of those running the simulations.
</em><br>
<p>Similar objections are raised to many of our discussions about the
<br>
future, such as about interstellar colonization or the Fermi paradox
<br>
or a world of AIs.  Yes, this is a concern, but we should do the best
<br>
we can, and try to focus on the predictions we have the most confidence
<br>
in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Robin's first suggestion is that it is more probable that everyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the world is a &quot;zombie&quot;, a being who acts conscious but actually is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not, and therefore we might care less about other people.  However many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophers argue that zombies are impossible
</em><br>
<p>I had in mind much cruder things.  For example, some &quot;people&quot; in a crowd
<br>
simulation might be run by very simple programs that have them wiggle
<br>
and mumble &quot;peas and carrots&quot; like extras supposedly did once in movie
<br>
crowd scenes.   Or, far from the simulated people of interest, the
<br>
behavior of many people might be randomly generated based on statistics
<br>
from previous simulations, or come from  &quot;cached&quot; records of previous
<br>
simulated people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we are in a simulation (assuming humans or their descendants run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sim) then this tells us that human history extends long enough for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simulations to be common, causing us to actually be more optimistic that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we could live a long time.
</em><br>
<p>Good point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Plus there is the observational fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world seems to be getting faster, more complex and more interesting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggesting that the simulation still has some way to go and is not about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to stop.
</em><br>
<p>That only applies to globally motivated simulations.  Someone who told
<br>
their &quot;holodeck&quot; to take them back to a party at the millennium might
<br>
end that simulation when the party got boring, regardless of how
<br>
interesting the world as a whole was getting.
