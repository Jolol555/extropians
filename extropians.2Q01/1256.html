reasons, and in part because it hasn't been completely worked out) --
<br>
you should be able to throw away the concept of 'agriculture'
<br>
entirely.  Base your food resources entirely on from the ground up
<br>
engineered self-replicating systems.  You ought to be able to design
<br>
bacteria that turn sunlight directly into food.  With typical insolations
<br>
and conversion efficiencies I think you can get it down to a 2-3 m^2
<br>
per person (in the sunnier parts of the world).
<br>
<p>People have been blocked by thinking we need diamondoid nanotech
<br>
to produce many of the 'wonders' associated with it.  But its the
<br>
&quot;self-replication&quot; aspect of things that gives you many of the
<br>
benefits (and potential hazards).  And we already have that all
<br>
around us.
