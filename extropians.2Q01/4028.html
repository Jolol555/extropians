<p>
I had hope there would be something like a Body Shop (so you did not have to
<br>
wait to see how the DNA expressed itself,  (body's perhaps tank grown) so
<br>
you could select from one you want. Going to the gym I realize that you
<br>
would need data sheets on the bodies because some great looking people have
<br>
major joint or internal organ problems. There would most likely have to be a
<br>
computer program to compute mind/body comparability, you would not want to
<br>
wake up in a body and find your mind and the body's dopamine receptors
<br>
interactions made you insane. 
<br>
<p>There is also the problem of fashion, right now I would most likely want to
<br>
have a body and face like Frank Sepe but what happens if the fashion was an
<br>
aquatic octopus body when you were reanimated. Talk about be in the out peer
<br>
group!
<br>
<p>Best Ralph
