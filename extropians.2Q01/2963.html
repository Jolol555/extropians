<p>I saw a map of the area.  The Chinese airport was a short distance to
<br>
the north; their home base (and, from the looks of it, the nearest
<br>
non-Chinese piece of dirt) was a much longer distance to the northwest.
<br>
I suspect it was &quot;land in China or land in the sea&quot;.  The Chinese would
<br>
be able to salvage it from the sea; destroying the sensitive equipment
<br>
would have been riskier, and possibly less certain, while the plane was
<br>
sinking.
