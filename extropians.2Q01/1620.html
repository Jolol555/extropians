On reflection, though: there is a profound tendency to go for the sledgehammer, the quick fix. It is a truism in some
<br>
circles that therapy is intended to, at best, adapt the patient to a crazy world. Seems plausible to me; And _that_ does
<br>
indeed bother me.
<br>
<p>However: if the primary purpose of a chemical quick fix is to stabilize a patient, and then really deal with matters, it
<br>
seems no less ethical than strapping a patient to a backboard and administering morphine while transporting, even when
<br>
the patient is in so much pain that they are crying to be killed.
<br>
<p>Sometimes they _do_  thank you for it later.
