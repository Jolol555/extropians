<p>
I have to admit that I did not read this whole essay closely, but I
<br>
want to comment on one point raised early on by Colin Tudge:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why, then, does science allow itself to be seen as the natural enemy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion, and thus antagonise so many people for no good reason at all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But religion as a whole does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest on that one piece of theology; and in general, given that religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is innately untestable, it remains outside the purlieus of science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There can be spats, but there is no mortal conflict in which to engage.
</em><br>
<p>Tudge is suggesting that science is defined by testability and religion
<br>
by that which is untestable, and so there is no conflict.
<br>
<p>However to say that religion is untestable is to say that it has no
<br>
effect in the world, that God is impotent in this life.  Religion in
<br>
this view confines itself to a belief in the afterlife and in proper
<br>
moral conduct.  This form of religion has no miracles, no holy men,
<br>
no prophets.  Holy books are political and social documents, and the
<br>
gods and saints of the past were ordinary human beings.
<br>
<p>Such a stripped-down view of religion may match that of a few ascetics,
<br>
but hardly corresponds to most religions that exist in the world today.
<br>
The vast majority of religious people believe in miracles, in the
<br>
efficacy of prayer, in the ability of God to affect the world.  Ask them
<br>
to believe in a religion which has been pushed back to the &quot;untestable&quot;
<br>
level described by Tudge and you will not find many takers.
<br>
<p>So it is no wonder that science and religion conflict; where once
<br>
religion held sway over the entire world, science has steadily pushed it
<br>
back as more of the world has come to be understood, and more phenomena
<br>
have come to be testable.  Does prayer work?  We can run the experiment
<br>
and find out.  Can prophets predict the future?  Let's do a statistical
<br>
analysis.  Did Noah's flood cover the earth with water?  Let's look at
<br>
the geological record.
<br>
<p>The writing is on the wall for religion; eventually it will be reduced to
<br>
something like Zen Buddhism, a set of rituals practiced for the peace of
<br>
mind they bring.  Unless, of course, some religion turns out to be true,
<br>
and God, or Allah, or whoever, steps in to protect his faithful and smite
<br>
the unbelievers.  Without such intervention, science will kill religion.
<br>
Given this reality, conflict is inevitable.
<br>
<p>Hal
