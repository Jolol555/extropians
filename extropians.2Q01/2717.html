<p>Ditto on both counts here.  And let me add some evidence: when I first
<br>
saw Eliezer's work, I offered to help implement part of his plan (the
<br>
&quot;Flash&quot; XML in which the AI could operate).  He asked me to hold off
<br>
until he could get his notes together on that.
<br>
<p>This was many months ago, possibly over a year by now.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if that's info management failure on his part, or if the
<br>
notes he spoke of (which he stated would be necessary for
<br>
implementation) do not exist.  Either way, it speaks ill for eventually
<br>
being able to get it live.
<br>
<p>Eliezer: having built complex systems myself, I say that putting all
<br>
the information out for anyone to see - including notes sufficiently
<br>
detailed for someone other than yourself to actually build the system -
<br>
is a practical prerequisite to actually building what you propose.
<br>
Granted, in theory one could do it by oneself.  In practice, that leads
<br>
to practically infinite development times for complex projects, i.e.
<br>
the job does not ever get finished.  On the other hand, putting the
<br>
information up and letting others work on it will lead to faster
<br>
completion - even if (as sometimes happens) putting your thoughts
<br>
together enough that you can honestly say others can write from it,
<br>
forces you to put your thoughts together enough that *you* can write
<br>
from it, whereas keeping it all in your own head allows the
<br>
self-deception that you have it organized enough.  (I have been guilty
<br>
of this myself, in some of my earlier works that are now so thoroughly
<br>
abandoned there's not even anything to point to.)  Even if you only
<br>
have partially complete notes, put them up - that way other people, and
<br>
yourself, can *far* more easily see exactly what is missing, which is
<br>
necessary to fill in the gaps.  (As an example, consider the purpose of
<br>
things like Sourceforge.  Or, if you want something from my own past,
<br>
consider the plasma engine calculator I posted here: there were flaws
<br>
in my calculations - creds to anyone who wishes to go back in the
<br>
archives and check, check the power-to-heat equation first - but I did
<br>
not see them until I'd posted it; even though, as it turned out, no one
<br>
else found the error, or at least found it and told me about it.)
<br>
<p>Sorry if this comes across as a flame; it is not meant that way.  Your
<br>
system has promise, but I would like to see it made into reality
<br>
instead of being forever a dream.  Keeping the development
<br>
specifications (as opposed to the grand plan) to yourself is highly
<br>
unlikely to make the system real.  This is more important now that you
<br>
have this level of publicity; you may get contacts over the next few
<br>
days that, if given *all* the details you have *quickly* (not delayed
<br>
for weeks), may be able to make it real - and might well be the only
<br>
shot your project will get at reality within the next several years.
<br>
<p>Let me emphasize that last point: how you handle the sudden interest in
<br>
your project could, by itself, potentially make the difference between
<br>
a Singularity around 2005-2010 with Friendly AI, and a Singularity
<br>
around 2030 or later with unFriendly AI.  (This is the type of thing
<br>
the ads a few years ago meant by &quot;the power of one&quot;.)  Granted, that's
<br>
just potential - single digit, at best, percent chances either way -
<br>
but it ain't zero chance, given what you've got already.  (Though I
<br>
must admit the chances against are higher than the chances for, I can
<br>
still hope for the best.)
