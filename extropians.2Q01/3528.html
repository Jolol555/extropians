<p><p>Theory of computation *is* a practical skill, and will save you from a few 
<br>
headaches down the road.  I've also run into a few headaches because a lot 
<br>
of other people don't seem to understand this.
<br>
<p>A couple times in my life I have been in design meetings where someone will 
<br>
suggest a lovely sounding idea that I immediately recognize as 
<br>
theoretically impossible to implement.  The problem emerges when I am the 
<br>
only person in the room who sees this.  It is no fun trying to explain the 
<br>
impossibility of something to a group of people who have neither the 
<br>
education nor the experience to understand why this is the case, 
<br>
*particularly* when you are the lone dissenter and they are unwilling to 
<br>
spend the time for you to explain it to the point where they will 
<br>
understand.  Very frustrating.
<br>
<p>On the flip side, once or twice I have been in the situation where I 
<br>
propose an elegant and powerful solution to a complex problem, and it was 
<br>
immediately dismissed by the group as &quot;impossible&quot; because it defies their 
<br>
intuition despite the fact that they can't explain why it won't work.  Of 
<br>
course, this usually speaks more about the education and experience of the 
<br>
group than anything; dismissing an algorithm simply because one has never 
<br>
seen it before indicates larger problems.
<br>
<p>Note that these two scenarios don't happen that often, but that they happen 
<br>
at all indicates a sad state of affairs.
