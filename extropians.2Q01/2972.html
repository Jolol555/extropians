Careful Eliezer you're starting to sound like a SL4 elitist :-) Correct
<br>
me if I'm wrong, but the primary concern for Alcor etc. is to get a bunch
<br>
of average joes to start signing up for their services, right? Well I don't
<br>
think a marketing campaign of &quot;reversibly dead&quot; is going to work too well
<br>
for that demographic. It may hurt our sensibilities to hear some of the
<br>
marketing the cryonics orgs come up with, but it's ok with me if it allows
<br>
them to rack up more money/patients, therefore allowing more research and
<br>
financial stability.
<br>
<p>Future shock doesn't make you a lot of money- dumbing down your message so
<br>
the masses think they &quot;get it&quot; makes you a lot of money. (ok, so now I sound
<br>
like an elitist, but I'm not!!) Who's going to be the McDonalds or Microsoft
<br>
of the cryonics field? The Timeship people? Maybe...

<em>&gt; I have to say that I think &lt;ischemia&gt; is one of the less effective memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've run across lately.  Cryonics patients are DEAD.  Adapting to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future consists of recognizing that death is not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irreversible.  The euphemisms are not fooling anyone and I think it sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darn stupid, like wearing a sign that says &quot;Hi, I'm in denial&quot; or &quot;Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is a cult&quot;.  I know that this is exactly the same (false) accusation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made about a great many pieces of new terminology, including, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Singularity&quot; - I just happen to think that &quot;ischemia&quot;, out of all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms in the transhumanist glossary, happens to actually *be* that lousy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would suggest calling them &quot;reversibly dead&quot; patients, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously conveys that you have indeed emotionally accepted how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage has occurred, while carrying the future shock of the belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even *that* much damage is still reversible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saying that Alcor has sixty (or whatever) &quot;reversibly dead patients&quot; is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in itself, a powerful sign that cryonics is not cultish or denial or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Egyptian mummification sham.  Religions insist that mummies et cetera are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not &quot;dead&quot; in order to avoid the emotional fallout of accepting the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of death.  Saying that Alcor has sixty people in &quot;ischemic coma&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;temporal transport&quot; sounds like the service Alcor is providing is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability for grieving relatives to deny that death has occurred, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually saving lives.  Again, I think that adequate neural information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserved even without the new vitrification protocols, and that a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics patients are quite possibly coming back post-Singularity, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still have a tremendously bad impression of most current cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No religion would ever call its mummies &quot;reversibly dead&quot;.  The term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carries with it a visceral shock that instantly sets cryonics apart from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the known human fallacy of denying death.  &quot;Ischemia&quot; and similar terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are instantly, and correctly, processed as bureaucratese at the least and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious dogma at the worst.  I strongly recommend that you drop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;ischemia&quot; and &quot;temporal transport&quot; in favor of &quot;cryonic suspension&quot; or,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better yet, &quot;reversibly dead&quot;.
