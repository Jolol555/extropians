Economically, in terms terms of the economy, research and development
<br>
investment is the only way to increase productivity and thus gain growth.
<br>
<p>Thus, any sound economic policy saves reductions in research and development
<br>
for almost last if reductions are made, before only critical governmental
<br>
component operations, where critical means air traffic control.
<br>
<p>I don't encounter too many government programs that I think should be cut
<br>
because I never applied for any &quot;entitlement&quot; checks from the taxes paid to
<br>
the government.  I'm sure I could find something.
<br>
<p>I think the government should make a website, faxback line, and free phone
<br>
number to request printed material for the paying citzens, which means every
<br>
taxpayer, which means each citizen, that shows clearly and in detail the
<br>
route and destination of each penny, or perhaps dollar amount, in the entire
<br>
federal governmental system.
<br>
<p>This information is supposed to be available, and largely is, but it is not
<br>
readily available to the general public, which is what it should be.
<br>
<p>So, basically, technology research and development investment is the sacred
<br>
cow of economic growth.  That includes big and small science, and some
<br>
university programs, many or most of which receive federal funding.

<em>&gt; Subject: Bush Budget Jeopardizes Tech Fund
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal program that pays for research into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerging technologies like cheap digital TV components and new ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to diagnose genetic diseases is in jeopardy under President Bush's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; budget.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Scientists and companies that received federal funds from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Advanced Technology Program say cutting it would leave a huge gap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the availability of investments in future technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         If Bush gets his way, the Commerce Department program would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its funding -- which skyrocketed during the 1990s -- suspended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pending a review.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ``The program hasn't been thoroughly evaluated. We believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it ought to be,'' Commerce spokeswoman Mary Crawford said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Though ATP has a separate oversight office, which has given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program glowing reports as recently as May 2000, Crawford said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's not enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ``There have been a couple reports that have raised questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the program,'' she said. ``This is a new administration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Secretary (Donald) Evans is an engineer by background, he is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously committed to making sure that the Commerce Department is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing top-quality research.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Nevertheless, she said, cutting the program completely is ``not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the table.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         But cutting ATP has been on the table in Congress for years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with its Republican opponents calling it a form of ``corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare'' that should be ended. The Clinton administration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vigorously defended ATP, citing studies that said many companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not have pursued such research without federal help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         While ATP was created in 1988 trade legislation enacted under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Bush, it didn't receive funding from Congress until 1990.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 2001, Congress allocated $145.7 million to the program, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typically pays 50 percent of the costs of a selected project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Henry Kelly, president of the Federation of American Scientists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said that defending ATP has been difficult because the program only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds emerging technologies, and doesn't pay for a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ``Once you've got the basic idea in play, then people can run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off and make proprietary products,'' he said. ``There's a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (funding) gap that's left in places where the public has an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest in moving technology forward. ATP filled that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brilliantly.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         The program funded the development of cheap transmitters for use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in digital and high definition television, considered essential in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encouraging broadcasters and customers to use HDTV.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ``We probably wouldn't have been able to develop these kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques and capabilities without the ATP program,'' said Terry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smith, a director at New Jersey-based Sarnoff Corp., which took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part in the collaboration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         For Sarnoff and its partner companies, finding investors was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult in the current economic climate and companies didn't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take the economic risk for a technology that might not bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenue-producing products for many years. ATP provided about $28.4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ``This is technology that has huge potential for returns,''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smith said, ``but it's also a real stretch among the companies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are doing it.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         The government gave more than $31.4 million to Affymetrix of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Santa Clara, Calif., to develop keychain-sized DNA chips for use in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a handheld device that can analyze genetic material.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ``The near term benefits that have flowed out of it are improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools to do basic life science discovery,'' said Rob Lipshutz, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company's vice president for business development.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Other ATP-funded research had led to the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiberglass rustproof beams for bridges and towers, cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and a cornmeal-based polyester cloth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Kelly said one reason for the political opposition to ATP is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it first appeared as a heavily funded government program just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a budget-minded Republican Congress took over in 1994.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         ``It's probably the most investigated start-up fund in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of the government,'' he said. ``Its timing was such that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the new kid on the block at the wrong moment in history.''
