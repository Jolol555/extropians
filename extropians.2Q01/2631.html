Travas Gunnell, &lt;<a href="mailto:travasg@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Capitalism,%20Private%20Property,%20etc%20(was%20Re:%20Sweatshops)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104182347.QAA08066@finney.org&gt;">travasg@yahoo.com</a>&gt;, forwards:
<br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://infoshop.org/faq/secB3.html#secb31">http://infoshop.org/faq/secB3.html#secb31</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B.3.1 What is the difference between private property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and possession? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anarchists define &quot;private property&quot; (or just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;property,&quot; for short) as state-protected monopolies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of certain objects or privileges which are used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit others. &quot;Possession,&quot; on the other hand, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of things that are not used to exploit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others (e.g. a car, a refrigerator, a toothbrush,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.).
</em><br>
<p>So what does it mean to exploit others?  You give some examples:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus many things can be considered as either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property or possessions depending on how they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used. For example, a house that one lives in is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possession, whereas if one rents it to someone else at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a profit it becomes property. Similarly, if one uses a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw to make a living as a self-employed carpenter, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw is a possession; whereas if one employs others at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wages to use the saw for one's own profit, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property. 
</em><br>
<p>The common element here is that you have lent or rented out some
<br>
possession, for money.  Is that the definition of exploiting?  To loan
<br>
something for money?
<br>
<p>A loan is a transfer of property accompanied by a promise to give it back.
<br>
A loan for money adds a transfer of money from borrower to lender.
<br>
Apparently this is evil.  Why?
<br>
<p>What about other contractual arrangements?  Suppose I give you some object
<br>
in exchange for your promise to give me money on a regular, ongoing basis.
<br>
This is not a loan because there is no promise to return the object.
<br>
Does this make it morally OK?  Why or why not?
<br>
<p>I'm having trouble understanding the dividing line between which kinds
<br>
of freely-chosen, voluntarily-agreed-to arrangements between private
<br>
individuals are acceptable in this system and which are not.
<br>
<p>Hal
