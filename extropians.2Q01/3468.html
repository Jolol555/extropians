</em><br>
<p>Okay.  Good.  Something to focus in on.  The 'biggie' is Loss of Humanity.
<br>
Or, as you put it moments later, &quot;you won't retain human values.&quot;
<br>
<p>The words 'humanity' and 'human values' are code words for 'someone else's
<br>
idea of what constitutes humanity' and 'someone else's idea of what values
<br>
are 'right' values'.  I'm not buying it.  It's a veiled attempt to dictate
<br>
my choice of values for myself.  Life is filled with uncertainty and risk.
<br>
How I choose to confront these realities is, for the most part, nobody's
<br>
business but my own.  I say 'for the most part' because, clearly, choices I
<br>
make for myself will inevitably have some impact on others.  However,
<br>
that's always been the case.  But choosing transhumanism for myself, even
<br>
doing so 'recklessly', is not the same as forcing transhumanism on others.
<br>
Yet you, John, (and those 'others') don't hesitate for a moment to arrogate
<br>
the right, and presume the legitimacy, of forcing their 'correct' humanity
<br>
and their 'correct' values on me.  I respect your right to choose your own
<br>
values and your own path.  I'll take care of mine, thankyouverymuch,
<br>
perhaps recklessly, perhaps boldly. 
<br>
<p>Now, returning briefly to 'humanity' and 'human values', just what are
<br>
these?  The tribal prejudices of some organized superstition (religion), or
<br>
the political platitudes of some governing ideology?  Shall we offer for
<br>
the sake of comparison the FULL record--which is to say a truthful and
<br>
complete record of all the dark deeds of humans manifesting their
<br>
'humanity' and 'human values'-- not merely the sublime, the sanitized
<br>
historical apologism of the current cultural myth?  Shall we then, in light
<br>
of this honest accounting, ask what of our 'humanity' and 'human values'
<br>
deserves preserving?
<br>
<p>The question of loss of humanity is, at best, grounded in ignorance and
<br>
prejudice and primitive fear, and presumes, based on an historical fantasy,
<br>
the moral and rational correctness of the current state of affairs.  At
<br>
worst it is a devious and deceitful ploy to maintain control, based on the
<br>
historically effective but lately tattered idea that God and Ceasar know
<br>
what's right and therefore you must obey.  
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is merely the current manifestation of the ancient quest to
<br>
understand and progress.  That's 'progress' as in 'to make things better'.
<br>
(Are we likely to stumble along the way?  Well, duh.)  Thus, transhumanism
<br>
is FUNDAMENTALLY ethical.  We are unsatisfied with, unimpressed by, and
<br>
unwilling to meekly accept the limitations on justice, freedom, ethics,
<br>
compassion, health, intelligence, and personal fullfillment, imposed on our
<br>
'humanity' by the accidents of biology.  I welcome the criticism of my
<br>
critics.  I celebrate their freedom to criticize.  And I celebrate my
<br>
freedom to dismiss the strident protests of the misguided and misinformed
<br>
and to shrug off the looming umbrage of their masters.  My mind is my own.
<br>
That is the heart of Transhumanism.  That is what makes it unstoppable.

<br>
<p>Then, in response to Greg's
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Saying that you could hurt a group of people by picking out the least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; appealing members of the group and then depicting them as representative
</em><br>
is 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; true but, with respect, so what?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;John writes,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;#I'm warning that someone will eventually do this--that some sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etiquette is going to have be enforced on the public list or you're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to run into trouble. Yeah I know that flies in the face of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom-to-post-anything stance, but there it is.
</em><br>
<p>Trouble is inevitable.  It's practically a definition of the human
<br>
condition.  What's the alternative, to huddle, trembling beneath your
<br>
bedclothes?  Freedom has its price.  If it's trouble, then BRING IT ON!
<br>
No other way to get past it.
