THEISTWATCH SHORT SHOTS
<br>
<p>It didn't help.
<br>
<p>One of the anecdotal &quot;proofs&quot; of God's existence and the efficacy of
<br>
prayer or religious talismans is supposedly the presence of a
<br>
crucifix, Bible or some other charm which accompanies the &quot;miraculous&quot;
<br>
survival of a person in tragic circumstances.  Dozens may die in a
<br>
horrific motor vehicle crash, or perhaps an aviation disaster, but
<br>
one, lone survivor is somehow a &quot;miracle,&quot; and &quot;proof&quot; that God is
<br>
watching over, at least, someone.
<br>
<p>A religious talisman -- a paper Bible verse taped to his dashboard --
<br>
did not help racing superstar Dale Earnhardt, though, who was killed a
<br>
week ago on the final lap of the Daytona 500.  According to the
<br>
Charisma web site, Stevie Waltrip, wife of a former NASCAR star and
<br>
broadcaster, taped Proverbs 18:10 to the dashboard of the black Chevy
<br>
driven by Mr. Earnhardt.  The verse declares, &quot;The name of the Lord is
<br>
a strong tower; the righteous run into it and are safe.&quot;
<br>
<p>NASCAR, the leading auto-racing organization, has an official
<br>
chaplain, one Max Helton, who informed reporters that &quot;Stevie told me
<br>
the only reason she went to Daytona was to tape that to Dale's car.&quot;
<br>
He added that Earnhardt was &quot;committed although private about his
<br>
Christian faith,&quot; and had invited the preacher into the Victory Circle
<br>
to lead a thanksgiving prayer.  Charisma adds that &quot;Just before the
<br>
start of Sunday's Daytona 500, with the drivers strapped and ready to
<br>
go, Helton held the hand of Earnhardt and his wife, Teresa, and prayed
<br>
for a safe race.&quot;
<br>
<p>None of this did any good, of course, and Mr. Earnardt unfortunately
<br>
died.  As Atheists, we are sorry to see any one involved in such a
<br>
calamity; but the point is that the talisman did not work.  Now, had
<br>
Earnhardt &quot;miraculously&quot; survived, such a fact would no doubt be
<br>
attributed to the prayer and piece of paper attached to the dashboard
<br>
-- not the construction of the car, or a harness or helmet, or just
<br>
fate and luck.  Earnhardt's survival in a fiery accident would have
<br>
been cited as &quot;proof&quot; that God took time as manager and overseer of a
<br>
vast cosmos to intervene in an auto race on one continent of a tiny
<br>
planet in one (out of billions) of galaxies.
<br>
<p>It didn't turn out in such a fashion, but then again there is the
<br>
anemic, though time-tested claim that &quot;God works in mysterious ways.&quot;
<br>
<p>Speaking of NASCAR, the demise of Dale Earnardt may have an odd
<br>
synchronicity with Sunday's race which aired on ESPN.  Viewers may
<br>
have observed the 'READ THE FUTURE&quot; and &quot;leftbehind.com&quot; emblazoned on
<br>
a car, Randy MacDonald's No 72 Chevy in the Craftsman Truck Series
<br>
Florida Dodge Dealers 400 K race.  According to Ted Daniels of the
<br>
Millennium Watch Institute, a group which studies End Times belief in
<br>
America, MacDonald is &quot;an avid fan of the Left behind &quot; series
<br>
authored by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, and &quot;believes that the
<br>
message of the series has a direct application to his fellow drivers
<br>
who cruise around the track at speeds in excess of 150 miles an hour.&quot;
<br>
<p>The popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; books have sold nearly 30 million copies and
<br>
a movie version has just been released.  The plot involves the &quot;final
<br>
days&quot; prior to the Rapture, when devout Christians suddenly vanish and
<br>
rise into the air to meet Jesus.  Those unfortunates left behind
<br>
suffer the wrath of the Anti-Christ and his mischievous Tribulation,
<br>
before Jesus returns for the final slug-fest against Satan, a sort of
<br>
cosmological Tough Man contest, and establishes his theocratic
<br>
&quot;kingdom&quot; on Earth.
<br>
<p>In the LaHaye-Jenkins book/movie, airline passengers suddenly
<br>
disappear in mid flight.  The Rapture serves as inspiration for those
<br>
bumper stickers which declare, &quot;This Car Unmanned In Case of Rapture.&quot;
<br>
One would hope that Mr. MacDonald at least have the sensitivity to not
<br>
put one of those on his racing machine as he careens around the track
<br>
breaking all speed records.

<br>
the cultural mainstream,&quot; 2/7/01)
