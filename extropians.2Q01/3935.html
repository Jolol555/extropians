<p><em>&gt; &gt; One thing that will probably keep natural gas as the fuel of choice is that

<p>I did a search on &quot;hydrogen embrittlement&quot;. The primary cause seems to be 
<br>
wet environments, and cathodic protection of buried equipment, aside from 
<br>
fabrication treatments. The pipelines would need to be kept very dry and 
<br>
free from anything that could liberate hydrogen ions.
<br>
<p>Most buried pipelines are equipped for cathodic protection. This should not 
<br>
affect the inside of the pipe....
<br>
<p>Main gas lines operate at significant pressures - the long transport lines 
<br>
are the ones I am concerned with. Ultimately, a specially coated line will 
<br>
be developed to prevent stress cracks and embrittlement, but the present 
<br>
infrastructure will limit us to methane (or butane!) for quite a while.
<br>
<p>The problem of letting humans sense H2 leaks is a thorny one, if the 
<br>
traditional odiferants cause problems in fuel cells. One ray of hope I just 
<br>
read about (Science, 4/21/2001) is a mid temp (160 C) fuel cell that does 
<br>
not use platinum catalysts. Perhaps this chemistry is resistant to poisoning.
