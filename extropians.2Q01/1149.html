I have recently gotten my own hardcover copy of &quot;the Spike&quot; by Damien 
<br>
and I am EXTREMELY impressed by it.  His intelligence and sense 
<br>
of humor really shines throughout, making it a very fun read.  I 
<br>
always wanted a book which covered in detail the many fascinating 
<br>
topics we discuss here and I now have it.
<br>
<p>Where did Damien often turn to illuminate points in his book?  To 
<br>
a number of members on this very list!  It makes sense to me considering 
<br>
some of the gifted minds here and the quality of some of the posts. 
<br>
Damien dwells on the list to the point where I thought the book's 
<br>
subtitle should have been, &quot;a loveletter to the extrolist and it's membership!&quot; : )  
<br>
<p>The original version of this book came out in Australia in 1996 
<br>
but sadly did not make it to the United States.  Alot of technological 
<br>
progress has occurred since then.  But, not to worry, Damien has 
<br>
greatly updated and rewritten the book to keep well abreast of things. 
<br>
<p>I hope literally EVERYONE on this list purchases a copy of the book. 
<br>
Both because it is an excellent read and as a show of loyalty to a gifted writer among us.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John
