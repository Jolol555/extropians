</em><br>
<p>I came across an unusually blunt characterization of the politics of
<br>
creationism in a recent book by paleontologist Niles Eldredge called
<br>
_The Triumph of Evolution and the Failure of Creationism_ (2000).
<br>
<p>In Chapter 1, &quot;In the Beginning: Religion, Science,... and Politics&quot;
<br>
Eldredge says:
<br>
<p>&quot;There are... many people who believe literally that the notion
<br>
of biological evolution is the work of the devil...  I have spent
<br>
over twenty years talking with, debating, and reading the literature
<br>
of creationists...  I remain convinced that their unrelenting
<br>
hatred of the very idea of evolution stems from their concept of
<br>
morality:  where morals come from, and why people behave in a
<br>
moral fashion (when they do).  The argument is simple:  the Bible
<br>
says that 'mankind' was created in God's image.  If that is not
<br>
true, if instead we are descended from the apes, then there is no
<br>
reason whatsoever to expect humans to behave in a godlike, moral
<br>
fashion.  We would, instead, be expected to behave like 'animals.'
<br>
The conviction is deeply held.
<br>
<p>Thus, in some quarters, it is simply not possible to assign to science
<br>
the task of cosmology while giving religion the role of articulating
<br>
a moral and spiritual understanding of what it means to be a living
<br>
human.  It is not possible because the two are seen as inseparable:
<br>
morality flows automatically and solely from the manner in which
<br>
humans were 'created' in the first place.  From this perspective,
<br>
religion (meaning, specifically, certain forms of religion --
<br>
especially conservative Christianity, but also conservative strains
<br>
of Islam and Judaism) are fundamentally at odds with at least some
<br>
forms of scientific enterprise.
<br>
<p>In the United States especially, creationism is associated not
<br>
only most closely with aspects of Christian Fundamentalism, but
<br>
with conservative (mostly, if not exclusively, conservative Republican)
<br>
politics...  I cannot emphasize enough... that politics is the
<br>
very essence of this conflict.  It is the belief that evolution is
<br>
inherently evil -- a belief that stems from religious interpretation,
<br>
**and therefore poses a threat to the hearts and minds of the
<br>
populace**, that, I am convinced, motivates the vast majority of
<br>
the creationists.  Thus the issue is about what is to be taught
<br>
in the public schools...  On the face of it, then, creationism
<br>
is a political issue -- and has been at least since Clarence Darrow
<br>
defended John Scopes against the prosecutorial zeal of William
<br>
Jennings Bryan in Dayton, Tennessee, on July 10-21, 1925.
<br>
<p>Are there creationists who are religiously motivated but are not at
<br>
the same time social and political conservatives?  There must be,
<br>
but in twenty years I have yet to encounter a single such person.
<br>
Are there creationists, politically conservative or not, whose
<br>
main concern does lie in the apparent moral implications of
<br>
evolution and what it means especially to their own personal
<br>
lives -- whose main goal is not to influence what other people's
<br>
kids are taught in school?  Again, probably so.  But the vast
<br>
majority of active creationists... are motivated primarily to
<br>
see that evolution is not taught in the public schools of the
<br>
United States.
<br>
<p>In any case, what creationism is **not** is a valid intellectual
<br>
argument between opposing points of view.  That battle was fought --
<br>
with evolution emerging triumphant -- in the latter half of the
<br>
nineteenth century...  [S]o-called scientific creationism [was]
<br>
a wolf in sheep's clothing concocted in the 1970s that deliberately
<br>
removed religious rhetoric from the cant of creationism -- a
<br>
move calculated by bypass any objections based on the First
<br>
Amendment to teach such patently religiously inspired material
<br>
in a public school science class...  The best comment I have
<br>
ever heard anyone make about scientific creationism came from
<br>
Judge William Overton, who presided over the famed Arkansas trial
<br>
in 1981:  If this stuff is science, why do we need a law to teach
<br>
it? ... Intellectually, the debate has been dead since 1859...
<br>
<p>Yet the debate rages on ... though tactics have changed...&quot;
