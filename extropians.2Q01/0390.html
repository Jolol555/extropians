Folks on this list who have read Eliezer S. Yudkowsky's essays
<br>
know the historical significance he accords to a quarter-
<br>
century-old AI research program called &quot;Eurisko&quot; (which he apparently
<br>
learned about via Eric K. Drexler's _Engines of Creation_, as exemplified
<br>
by the remark &quot;Eurisko, designed by Douglas Lenat, is the best
<br>
existing example of a seed AI, or, for that matter, of any AI&quot;
<br>
(in Section 1.2 &quot;Creating an AI Industry&quot; of _The Plan to Singularity_
<br>
at <a href="http://sysopmind.com/sing/PtS/vision/industry.html">http://sysopmind.com/sing/PtS/vision/industry.html</a> ).  See also
<br>
footnote 1 to this section (at <a href="http://sysopmind.com/sing/PtS/vision/industry.html#foot-1">http://sysopmind.com/sing/PtS/vision/industry.html#foot-1</a> )
<br>
and _Coding a Transhuman AI 2.2.0_ at <a href="http://www.singinst.org/CaTAI.html">http://www.singinst.org/CaTAI.html</a>

<br>
<p>Douglas B. Lenat (in &quot;From _2001_ to 2001: Common Sense and the Mind of HAL&quot;,
<br>
his contribution to _HAL's Legacy: 2001's Computer as Dream and Reality_,
<br>
edited by David G. Stork [MIT Press, 1997]) describes the program thus:
<br>
<p>&quot;In the late 1970s I built a computer program (Eurisko) that discovered
<br>
things on its own in many fields. To get it to work, I had to give it the
<br>
power to tinker with its own learning heuristics and its own goals. I would
<br>
leave it running overnight and hurry in the next morning to see what it had
<br>
come up with. Often I'd find it in a mode best described as 'dead.' Sometime
<br>
during the night, Eurisko would decide that the best thing to do was to
<br>
commit suicide and shut itself off. More precisely, it modified its own
<br>
judgmental rules in a way that valued 'making no errors at all' as highly
<br>
as 'making productive new discoveries.' As soon as Eurisko did this, it
<br>
found it could successfully meet its new goal by doing nothing at all for
<br>
the rest of the night. This reminds me of HAL's boast: 'No 9000 computer
<br>
has ever made a mistake.' I eventually had to add a new heuristic to Eurisko --
<br>
one it couldn't modify in any way -- to explicitly forbid this sort of suicide.&quot;
<br>
<p>The full text of Lenat's article is available on-line at the Cycorp Web site:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cyc.com/halslegacy.html">http://www.cyc.com/halslegacy.html</a> .
<br>
<p>I have to admit that, although I had heard of Lenat and Cyc before
<br>
reading any of Eliezer Yudkowsky's essays, I would not have recognized
<br>
the name &quot;Eurisko&quot; prior to '97 or '98.  However, I was extremely surprised,
<br>
while channel-surfing a couple of weekends ago, to hear the word mentioned in,
<br>
of all things, an episode of the Fox television show _The X-Files_.
<br>
This turned out to be a re-run of a quite old (first season, from
<br>
Oct. '93) episode entitled &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; (written by Alex
<br>
Gansa and Howard Gordon, who apparently did enough background research
<br>
for their story to have turned up the name of Lenat's program).  This was
<br>
apparently the first _X-Files_ script to involve an AI; the later 5th-season
<br>
(Feb. '98) episode &quot;Kill Switch&quot;, written by William Gibson and Tom Maddox,
<br>
actually received some notice on this list
<br>
(e.g., <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q98/1864.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q98/1864.html</a> ).
<br>
<p>&quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; is based on the &quot;building-security AI turns homicidal&quot;
<br>
formula (cf. the 1993 TV movie _The Tower_,
<br>
<a href="http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/the-tower.html">http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/the-tower.html</a> ),
<br>
but there's some entertaining dialog involving computer wizard &quot;Brad Wilczek&quot;,
<br>
as well as paranoid hints of what might happen if the Defense Department ever
<br>
got the notion that some loose cannon of an independent genius really could
<br>
create an AI.  &quot;Eurisko&quot; in this story is the name of the company Wilczek
<br>
founded (in &quot;Crystal City&quot;, Virginia), not the AI.  The FBI gets involved when
<br>
the company's CEO dies under mysterious circumstances.  The excerpt below is
<br>
lifted from &quot;Katsku's X-Files&quot; Web site, where complete screenplays of many
<br>
of the episodes can be found (see <a href="http://www.sci.fi/~katsku/episodes.html">http://www.sci.fi/~katsku/episodes.html</a> ) --
<br>
watch out for SPOILERS.
<br>
<p>&lt;- [COMPUTER GENIUS BRAD] WILCZEK'S COUNTRY CLUB HOUSE -&gt;
<br>
(MULDER and SCULLY drive up. As they walk to the front door, a camera
<br>
follows them.)
<br>
MULDER: So this is what a 220 IQ and a $400 million severance settlement
<br>
buys you.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>WILCZEK: You can divide the computer science industry into two types of
<br>
people - neat and scruffy...  Neat people like things neat. They wear nicely
<br>
pressed suits and  work on surface phenomena. Things they can understand. Market
<br>
shares, and  third quarter profits.
<br>
SCULLY: And you had a different vision for the company?
<br>
WILCZEK: I started Eurisko out of my parents' garage. I was 22 years old.
<br>
I'd just spent a year following around the Grateful Dead. You know what
<br>
Eurisko means?
<br>
MULDER: That's from the Greek, isn't it? Um, &quot;I learn things.&quot;
<br>
WILCZEK: Not exactly. It means &quot;I discover things.&quot; (MULDER shrugs)
<br>
Unfortunately, [Eurisko's murdered CEO] wasn't interested in discovery.
<br>
He was a short-sighted, power-hungry opportunist...  That's why you guys
<br>
are here, isn't it? I'm your logical suspect.
<br>
SCULLY: You don't seem too worried.
<br>
WILCZEK: It's a puzzle, Miss Scully, and scruffy minds like me like puzzles.
<br>
We enjoy walking down unpredictable avenues of thought, turning new corners
<br>
- but as a general rule, scruffy minds don't commit murder.
<br>
<p>(MULDER and SCULLY share a look under ominous music.)
<br>
<p>&lt;- SCULLY'S APARTMENT -&gt;
<br>
<p>(SCULLY working at computer.)
<br>
<p>SCULLY VOICE OVER: Some see genius as the ability to connect the unconnected
<br>
- to make juxtapositions, to see relationships where others cannot. Is Brad
<br>
Wilczek a genius? I don't know. But I do know this for certain. He has a
<br>
predilection for elaborate game playing...
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>MULDER: I need to know why Brad Wilczek is the subject of a Code Five
<br>
investigation. What the Defense Department wants with him.
<br>
DEEP THROAT: What do you think they'd want with the most innovative programmer
<br>
in this hemisphere?
<br>
MULDER: Software.
<br>
DEEP THROAT: For years, Wilczek has thumbed his nose at any contract involving
<br>
weapons applications. He's a bleeding heart.
<br>
MULDER: What kind of software?
<br>
DEEP THROAT: How much do you know about artificial intelligence?
<br>
MULDER: I thought it was only theoretical.
<br>
DEEP THROAT: It was, until two years ago. You remember Helsinki, the first
<br>
time that a chess playing computer ever beat a Grand Master? (MULDER nods.)
<br>
That was Wilczek's program. And the rumor was that he did it by developing the
<br>
first adaptive network.
<br>
MULDER: An adaptive network?
<br>
DEEP THROAT: It's a learning machine. A computer that actually thinks. And
<br>
it's, ah, become something of a holy grail for some of our more acquisitive
<br>
colleagues in the Department of Defense.
<br>
<p>...  [SPOILER BELOW]
<br>
<p><p><p><p>MULDER: I checked with Congressman Klebanon and the Department of Corrections
<br>
Subcommittee. I even petitioned the Attorney General's office.
<br>
DEEP THROAT: You won't find him.
<br>
MULDER: They can't just take a man like Brad Wilczek without an explanation.
<br>
DEEP THROAT: They can do anything they want.
<br>
MULDER: Where is he?
<br>
DEEP THROAT: In the middle of what we in the trade call &quot;hard bargaining&quot;.
<br>
MULDER: Wilczek won't deal. He'll never work for them.
<br>
DEEP THROAT: Loss of freedom does funny things to a man, and remember,
<br>
Wilczek confessed to two murders, and you effectively destroyed the only
<br>
evidence that could have exonerated him.
<br>
MULDER: What else could I have done?
<br>
DEEP THROAT: Nothing... Unless you were willing to let the technology survive.
<br>
MULDER: The Department of Defense still hasn't found anything?
<br>
DEEP THROAT: They've been on it for five days. Wilczek's virus was thorough. It
<br>
left no trace of the artificial intelligence. The machine is dead.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>While googling for recent Web pages referencing Lenat and Cyc, I came across
<br>
the following interesting page -- &quot;The Outsider's Guide to Artificial
<br>
Intelligence&quot;, at <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/">http://www.robotwisdom.com/ai/</a>
<br>
Following a link from this page to a book excerpt containing a brief bio of
<br>
Lenat hosted at (my alma mater!) New York University:
<br>
<a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/shasha/outofmind/lenat.html">http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/shasha/outofmind/lenat.html</a> ,
<br>
I discovered a couple of details of some amusement to me (if to no one else) --
<br>
he's two years older than I am (b. 1950), and he spent some of his childhood in
<br>
Wilmington, Delaware (I grew up a few miles away in Newark, Delaware).
<br>
He seems to have benefitted more from that environment than I did (partly, he
<br>
claims, from having changed school districts so often that he never got a chance
<br>
to loaf in the advanced classes -- he was always tracked with the &quot;hoods&quot; who
<br>
weren't expected to do well, so he had to work especially hard to overcome that
<br>
expectation)  ;-&gt; .
<br>
<p>I asked a friend to confirm the translation of &quot;eurisko&quot; given in
<br>
the dialog above.  His reply (quoted with permission) was:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyway, I heard recently (on an episode of the TV series _The X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Files_, of all places) that the term &quot;eurisko&quot; is also a sentence in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Greek meaning &quot;I discover things.&quot;  Can you confirm that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My Greek-English dictionary does indeed give that meaning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Fortunately, in Greek as in Latin dictionaries, the first-person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singular is the canonical form, so it is sitting right there, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't need to know the conjugation.)  &quot;To find, find out, discover.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It can also mean devise, invent, fetch, sell for, be worth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also, I assume the word &quot;heuristic&quot; has a related etymology (is it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coinage, by any chance, or a naturally-evolved word?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does come from that root, says the OED, but is an irregular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formation &amp; did not exist in ancient Greek.  It appears to have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coined, more or less simultaneously in English &amp; German, in the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 19th century as a technicality of logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you might suspect, Archimedes' &quot;eureka&quot; is the perfect tense of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same verb.  Says the OED:  &quot;The correct spelling _heureka_ is rare&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (The sound represented by H in English does not have a counterpart in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Greek alphabet; it was regarded as a property of the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vowel &amp; was indicated by putting a reversed apostrophe over it.)
</em><br>
