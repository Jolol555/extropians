<p>
I poked my nose a while back into an exchange between
<br>
Damien and Eliezer in which Eliezer had displayed some
<br>
rhetorical legerdemain by standing on its head the
<br>
usual claim that science deals in falsifiable
<br>
assertions and hypotheses, while relgion deals
<br>
with inherently non-falsifiable concepts.  E. made
<br>
the statement that prior to the modern era,
<br>
religious texts relied for their authority on
<br>
descriptions of events (such as Moses parting the
<br>
Red Sea) that are very concrete indeed, and thus
<br>
falsifiable in principle, whereas it was a
<br>
symptom of the demoralization of modern theologians
<br>
that they shied away from such concrete statements.
<br>
<p>I chimed in with an attempt to make the point that,
<br>
nevertheless, religion has always had somewhat of
<br>
the aspect of a confidence trick, because even
<br>
if signs and miracles were once described in unambiguous
<br>
terms, they were safely enough distant in space and
<br>
time that no chain of evidence was ever likely to surface to
<br>
embarrass the priests.  There was also some discussion
<br>
of whether any alleged past event could ever be considered
<br>
beyond the range of verification by some future
<br>
ultratechnology.
<br>
<p>It occurs to me now that this is all really beside the
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>I think the most important element of belief, for
<br>
scientists and priests and laymen alike, for butchers
<br>
and bakers and computer programmers, is the culturally-
<br>
derived semantic web that people carry around in their
<br>
heads, what W. V. O. Quine called, in a book by that
<br>
title, &quot;The Web of Belief&quot;.
<br>
<p>Most people **do not bother** to verify the vast
<br>
majority of facts they are nevertheless willing to classify
<br>
as true or false (except for trivial things like what
<br>
time the train to Boston leaves this afternoon, or
<br>
whether there's any Coca-Cola left in the refrigerator).
<br>
All the larger issues, like when Julius Caesar was born,
<br>
or whether F=GMm/r2, whether it's safe to drink fluoridated
<br>
water, or whether O. J. Simpson murdered his wife,
<br>
we leave to experts to decide.
<br>
<p>It's part of the division of labor in modern society
<br>
that there are specialized subcultures -- the scientific
<br>
community, the legal profession, the medical profession --
<br>
with the equipment and the training and the traditions
<br>
about rules of evidence required to perform the difficult
<br>
labor of verification of facts and hypotheses, and the rest
<br>
of us, in 99.9% of all cases, rely on **them** to do the work,
<br>
and accept their reports as a good-enough account of the truth.
<br>
<p>This does **not** mean that we just blindly accept
<br>
random statements from these people.  The Harvard biologist
<br>
E. O. Wilson wrote, in a recent book, about &quot;consilience&quot; -- the
<br>
idea that the separate fields of science are converging,
<br>
slowly but inexorably, into a unified, compatible story
<br>
about how the world works.  Similarly, everybody
<br>
expects a similar consilience to exist among broader areas of
<br>
expertise -- we expect legal experts to take current
<br>
scientific opinion to heart, and we certainly expect
<br>
medical experts to do the same.  Industrial and business
<br>
practices, similarly, are informed through and through
<br>
by scientific opinion -- and I'm using the word &quot;science&quot;
<br>
here the way it is usually meant -- those traditions
<br>
of argument and rules of evidence that are practiced
<br>
and taught by the expert scientific community -- the
<br>
people who get to publish in refereed journals and
<br>
hold professorships at major universities, even if,
<br>
as Eliezer insists, there's no hard and fast boundary
<br>
between what they do and what ordinary people do
<br>
when they have to use their wits to figure things out
<br>
in ordinary life.  It's simply a matter of rigor,
<br>
and systematization, and refinement, like the difference
<br>
between singing in the shower and performing at
<br>
Carnegie Hall.
<br>
<p>It fits in with this notion of consilience that educated
<br>
modern people, more than people of past times, insist
<br>
that any fact or principle in which they are expected to
<br>
believe must be able to be integrated into a consistent
<br>
nexus of similar facts and principles without collapsing
<br>
or radically distorting the entire web.  People are
<br>
less willing, I think, to accept on authority particular,
<br>
isolated facts, or little islands of special belief,
<br>
that don't fit in with that all-encompassing web that
<br>
includes Einstein and Darwin, H-bombs, comsats, and computers,
<br>
as well as less visible entities like electrons and
<br>
dinosaurs and magnetic fields, all linked together into
<br>
a more-or-less unified, more-or-less well-understood --
<br>
depending on a person's level of intelligence and
<br>
education, and more-or-less universally-shared view of
<br>
how the world works.
<br>
<p>This web saves a lot of time and effort when it
<br>
comes to disbelieving offhand an enormous class
<br>
of things that people might once have been less
<br>
inclined to disbelieve.
<br>
<p>So, if somebody tells me they've seen a dryad in the
<br>
woods, or fairies in the garden, or a ghost in the
<br>
cemetery, I dismiss these things automatically not
<br>
because I've bothered to perform any experiments,
<br>
or have any intention of ever doing so, but because
<br>
they simply do not integrate with the rest of the
<br>
web.  Similarly with more serious issues, like the
<br>
question of life after death.  I don't believe it because
<br>
it doesn't fit easily into the web, not without a
<br>
lot of stretching and straining and special pleading,
<br>
and I just don't have enough wishful thinking in me
<br>
to be able to bother to make the effort.  It's the same
<br>
with the idea that Moses parted the Red Sea.
<br>
<p>The persistence of &quot;that old-time religion&quot; in the modern
<br>
world is simply due to some groups of people having
<br>
been insufficently exposed to the web of consilience,
<br>
very largely, I think, due to the unavailability or ineffectiveness
<br>
of education.  When young adults jettison, for instance, the
<br>
belief in special creation they've been bought up with in favor
<br>
of the modern secular view of dinosaurs, and Darwin, and the
<br>
4.5-billion-year-old Earth, it usually happens not because they've
<br>
been bullied into it, but because they're reasonably
<br>
bright to begin with, and they've gone off to college
<br>
and been exposed to the big bad modern web of belief.
<br>
<p>The enormous intellectual appeal of consilience and
<br>
self-consistency gives the modern scientific web of
<br>
belief a tremendous advantage when it comes to colonizing halfway-
<br>
intellgent brains.  You don't have to attend Evolutionists
<br>
Anonymous meetings to continue to believe in Darwin.
<br>
It's the smaller, coarser-grained, less-well-knitted webs of
<br>
traditional religious doctrines that require an enormous
<br>
ongoing amount of social support to hold together.
<br>
<p>Could I someday come to believe in ghosts and God and
<br>
life after death and fairies and vampires and Moses and
<br>
the Red Sea?  Yes, of course, but the whole web would have
<br>
to change, with much more all-encompassing abstractions
<br>
about what's possible in the universe in the middle,
<br>
and a vast number of new facts at the periphery, both
<br>
already-verified (by experts) and possibly-true.  And the
<br>
current web wouldn't just be thrown out, it would be subsumed into
<br>
the new one, with all the existing nodes systematically
<br>
transformed into new ones, and the whole structure of
<br>
intricate links preserved in some form or other in the
<br>
new network.  Oh, and &quot;Moses and the Red Sea&quot; would still
<br>
be unverified -- by me personally, of course, and probably
<br>
by the experts, too.  It would simply have changed status from
<br>
&quot;imcompatible: almost certainly untrue&quot; under the old web to
<br>
&quot;compatible: quite possibly true&quot; under the new one.  I
<br>
wouldn't necessarily need to see the &quot;light of other days&quot;
<br>
to come to believe it.
