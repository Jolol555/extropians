<p><em>&gt;Oh of course, I'm thinking more along the lines of Dr. Moreau.... ;) The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problems can't be fixed unless research is allowed. All the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legislation (and in other developed countries) is doing is ensuring that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the test subjects will be third worlders, under no legal protections...
</em><br>
<p>Research needs to be done, but it needs to be done on primates.  The catch
<br>
of restricting research, of course, is people who currently want cloning,
<br>
such as infertile couples, but may be too old to raise a child by the time
<br>
it's low-risk for people.
<br>
<p>One important ethical point, in relation to the infertile, is that our society
<br>
*absolutely* allows reproduction that puts the fetus at great risk, as
<br>
long as it's the only option for the parents.  Tay-Sachs or cystic fibrosis
<br>
carrier couples can have children, even though they have a 1/4 risk of
<br>
producing a child with defects far worse than what have come from 
<br>
cloning.  Huntingdon's carriers can reproduce with a 50% risk of a very
<br>
nasty disease. Couples with serious fertility problems are downright 
<br>
encouraged to keep trying, even after multiple miscarriages show another
<br>
is a virtual certainty.  Even when risk is avoidable - such as fetal alcohol
<br>
syndrome - punishment is rare and severe punishment absent.
<br>
<p>If fetal risk requires barring cloning even for infertile couples, integrity 
<br>
requires we shut down most infertility treatment and unleash the hounds of 
<br>
eugenics on carriers.  I don't want to do that, and I hope most other people
<br>
don't either.  Unfortunately, Congress isn't know for ethical integrity.
<br>
It is unnerving, though, that this ban would provide future precedent for
<br>
eugenics legislation.  The basic principle: that Congress may legislate
<br>
reproduction for the purpose of protecting good genetics, is the founding
<br>
principle of coercive eugenics.
