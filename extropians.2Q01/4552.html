<em>&gt; One idea I had turns out (so I like to think) isomorphic to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe how time travel would really work.  You can't imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my anticipation of reading that, only to be rather disappointed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seemed that DD was saying that --- well, you know how anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can happen in the multiverse?  E.g., your keyboard could suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn into a brown rabbit, because there is a small amplitude in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; QM for just such a transformation? --- he was saying, or so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to to me, that the appearance of a time traveler from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future was exactly such a miraculous transformation.  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dull.
</em><br>
<p>That was not how I read it.  It read to me that, since paradoxes are
<br>
impossible, the probability of events that would thwart paradox
<br>
creation get bumped up in proportion to the probability of the paradox
<br>
suceeding.  (Or: normally, malfunction A has a 1% chance, malfunction B
<br>
has a 3% chance, and success has the remaining 96% chance.  But if
<br>
success would create a paradox, success automatically has 0%, thus A
<br>
has 25% and B has 75%.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But here was my idea from many years ago:  suppose (to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the paradox simpler) we have a Contrarian.  This person will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always say &quot;Yes&quot; if he is supposed to say &quot;No&quot; and vice-verse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Contrarian receives information from the future that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about to say &quot;Yes&quot;, so naturally he says &quot;No&quot;.  Well, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after he writes down his answer somewhere, and some time travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparatus gets hold of it, it's now the &quot;No&quot; answer that flies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backwards in time.  This time, the past Contrarian is presented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the &quot;He said No&quot; information, and so says &quot;Yes&quot;.  Then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later, when **his** information is written down and then used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the time travel apparatus, the cycle repeats.
</em><br>
<p>Unless his information gets mistranscribed, or the wrong (or an
<br>
illegible) message gets sent, et cetera.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But so far as I can make out, this is what David Deutsch is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in effect saying.  If you &quot;go back in time&quot; you are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a different branch of the multiverse, that's all.  (The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse is a continuum, so it would lack my finite recursion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property that I used for illustration above, but that isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential.)
</em><br>
<p>It has been hypothesized that, just as particles can only have
<br>
multiples of certain quanta of energy, particles can only move in
<br>
multiples of certain distances - essentially a universe of voxels, with
<br>
resolution far smaller than can be measured by any instrument we have
<br>
yet devised.  If this turns out to be correct, it would imply that any
<br>
real continuum is made up of discreet elements, and thus can do finite
<br>
(or countably infinite) recursion as you described.
