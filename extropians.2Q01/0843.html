<p><em>&gt; There's no question that the ISS design is right in maintaining the main

<em>&gt; connection between modules as a simple opening for people to pass through 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be easily closed and sealed.  
</em><br>
<p>There is no reason that interior connections have to pass through open
<br>
hatches.  Cables and piping can penetrate the hull around the hatch and
<br>
pass into the pressurized tunnel connecting the two modules.  The
<br>
connections are then made in the pressurized tunnel after docking,
<br>
retaining the ability to close the hatches on both modules.  I believe
<br>
that this is how connections were made between the Apollo command module
<br>
and the LM.
<br>
<p>The advantages are obvious:  no EVA required for these connections, fewer
<br>
penetrations between pressure volume and vacuum, easier to get at the
<br>
connectors if there is a problem, rapid disconnection in an emergency,
<br>
more benign environment for the connectors, much easier to add connecting
<br>
lines in the future. The only disadvantage that I can see is that you
<br>
might need a slightly larger connecting tunnel. 
<br>
<p>I have asked, and never heard an reasonable explaination why intermodule
<br>
connections were not done this way.
