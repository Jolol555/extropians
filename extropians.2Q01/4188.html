<p>&lt;&lt; Indeed, I do think that, at its heart, Western science's quest for &quot;one 
<br>
true
<br>
&nbsp;equation&quot; underlying everything can be directly derived from Judeochristian
<br>
&nbsp;religion with its &quot;one true god.&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br>
Ben, there was no real &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; way of thinking, if we direct our 
<br>
attention to history and archeology. The was Jewish and there was Christian. 
<br>
Both systems are hopelessly, flawed; one proselytizes and one doesn't. 
<br>
Because Roman scholars took Greek Christian translation of the books of Moe 
<br>
and so forth, and redact it into something useful to Constantine, does not 
<br>
constitute a Judeo-Christian thesis, though many scholars used to pretend 
<br>
there was such a genuine article. To your path to the one true equation, I 
<br>
suspect that if one is a dedicated math head, as opposed to a meth head, 
<br>
achieving the great equation is Endorphin City (buzz buzz buzzzz). For the 
<br>
rest of us poor schmucks, we look for an enjoy practical, results.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Perhaps the universe is not actually structured such that there is one
<br>
compact pattern that explains everything, either in the domain of spiritual
<br>
experience or in the domain of physical law.  Perhaps there are multiple
<br>
overlapping patterns....  This is how it seems right now in the physics
<br>
domain -- quantum theory and general relativity being examples of deep,
<br>
overlapping, difficult-to-unify patterns -- but we, our archetypal view
<br>
being the Judeochristian &quot;one true law&quot; approach, persist in believing there
<br>
MUST be an elegant underlying unifying equation....  Perhaps the one who&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Lee Smolin at Tufts University, seems to agree with that conjecture, when he 
<br>
responded to Freeman Dyson, on whether Life is digital or analog? He seemed 
<br>
to think its a mistake claiming life to be either-or. He seems the essence of 
<br>
theoretical physics, combined with pragmatism.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Real truth seems to be an interesting mix of absolutism and relativism;
<br>
either extreme attitude is an unproductive one.
<br>
I think that a mix of absolutism and relativism is best.  Funnily enough,
<br>
this is what most humans have evolved to profess.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That seems to best describe the universe, doesn't it?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It's no individual's opinion, but it may be a mass nonlinear superposition
<br>
of many peoples' opinions.
<br>
<p>The &quot;physical world&quot; itself may be this, actually.  This is the direction in
<br>
which quantum gravity leads us.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, Junior scrapes his knee, he is cut and it bleeds, it stings! Fuck! Now 
<br>
is this Junior holding onto his Ingrid knee, simply an illusion or a 
<br>
projection of superposed mass minds, or is the world really an ouch-able 
<br>
place and whether Junior must deal with stimuli as the self aware central 
<br>
nervous systems that we are? I go with the world is as we detect it, unless 
<br>
we have some evidence otherwise.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Eli, take a few hits of blotter acid...

<p>Imagines E. Yudkowsky on windowpanes, screaming &quot;Garl Coleman is the
