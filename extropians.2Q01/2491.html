<em>&gt; &gt; I take the classical liberal stance that even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when plenty of ethical systems and views are erroneous, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morally wrong to repress them - even if you believe in an objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality you better admit to yourself that you might be mistaken about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things, and if you force your views on others you might be perpetuating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an ethical outrage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It depends on what you mean by the somewhat curious construct &quot;force
<br>
your views&quot;.  If it means you shouldn't judge people or something of
<br>
that kind by standards that might not be their own and might be wrong,
<br>
then I think that would be carrying relativism too far.  We have little
<br>
choice but to judge 
<br>
as best we can.  That we are not infallible says we should pay good
<br>
attention and be open to learning whether we are wrong.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That we might be mistaken about things is part of our genetically driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological morality. That others may be equally or more mistaken makes this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier. Permutation City isn't built in a day though, so rather than waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and resources repressing luddite memes, it seems more useful to promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and encourage greater health, prosperity, freedom, practicality, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellence, than to dwell on coercive memes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't have a lot to do with our biology.  Without some mystical
<br>
sort of Absolute Knowledge we are always possibly mistaken about
<br>
everything to some extent including moral judgements.  I don't think our
<br>
moral judgements are all driven by biology unless we haven't bothered to
<br>
think through our ethical notions much.  Most people haven't.  
<br>
<p>There is no need to coerce anyone.  There is only the need to
<br>
successfully defend against being coerced.  On the other hand, we might
<br>
have to leave if we are going to be non-coercive but so seriously
<br>
augmented that the leas or willingly unaugmented ones resent us and wish
<br>
to be rid of us.  At that point it is either leave or ever so gently pop
<br>
those who aren't willing to deal with reality into VR land where they
<br>
can lead as many lives as they think they wish as needed before they
<br>
change their mind.  Is this coercion?  If it came down to either a fatal
<br>
conflict or this would it be coercion to force the VR choice?  The
<br>
ethics get sticky there.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The same of course goes for everybody else, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hence a policy of tolerance is the best option. This doesn't mean you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have to stop questioning things, testing whether ethical systems hold up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or asking uncomfortable questions to people. Political correctness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not really tolerant of this.
</em><br>
<p>What???  You can never ever stop questioning everything.  We are not
<br>
here to make each other comfortable. Making someone uncomfortable is not
<br>
coercion. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Right. That's what my (tolerant) comments intend to convey (without getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the ethics quagmire).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We had best wade into that quagmire though.  Because some of the
<br>
toughest and most crucial parts of this rollercoast ride into Tomorrow
<br>
Land lie there.
