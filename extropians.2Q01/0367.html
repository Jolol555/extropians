<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BERLIN, March 10 (AFP) - An Italian doctor who helped the  
<br>
world's oldest mother become pregnant said he will start cloning 
<br>
babies in Israel, where the controversial project is legal, the 
<br>
German weekly Der Spiegel said in its Monday issue. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Severino Antinori said Friday that a cloned baby could  
<br>
be created within two years using techniques already practiced on 
<br>
animals. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of Israeli scientists are already working on the project  
<br>
in the coastal town of Caesera, north of Tel Aviv, where the Abaclon 
<br>
company was founded for the purpose. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jewish belief does not oppose cloning in the same way as the  
<br>
Catholic church,&quot; one of the Israeli scientists told the magazine, 
<br>
adding that it was &quot;time to move beyond the laws of nature.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avi Ben-Abraham declined to name the programme's investors,  
<br>
saying &quot;money played no role.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antinori said the procedure would involve taking cells from an  
<br>
infertile father and injecting them into an egg, which would then be 
<br>
placed in the mother's uterus. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting child would have the same physical characteristics  
<br>
as the father and infertile parents would not have to rely on sperm 
<br>
donors. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cloning is the last frontier giving (an infertile) man the  
<br>
chance to transmit his genes and become a father,&quot; Antinori told a 
<br>
conference in Rome Monday. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-abortion charity group Life condemned the doctor's  
<br>
plans but said it was &quot;inevitable&quot; someone would try to clone 
<br>
babies. 
<br>
