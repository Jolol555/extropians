Passion for science that lies in the genes
<br>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3978317,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3978317,00.html</a>
<br>
The man who cracked the secret of DNA tells the Guardian's science editor,
<br>
Tim Radford, about his confidence in the biotech revolution and why he
<br>
thinks the left is to blame for scaremongering over genetically modified
<br>
food
<br>
<p>The genetics pioneer James Watson, 72, isn't frightened of the misuse of
<br>
genetic knowledge. He fears that people will reject genetic screening
<br>
because they are afraid to know what the future will hold.
<br>
<p>&quot;My chief fear is that the truly ethical problem is the disuse of
<br>
genetics, not the misuse,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;Because this term genetic
<br>
screening sounds bad, anyone who wants to screen people is taking away
<br>
their freedom - whereas predicting a bad future is a good thing, if you
<br>
can reverse it. If you can see that someone is going to be killed or raped
<br>
you can arrive on the scene and prevent it. It's good to look into the
<br>
future.&quot;
<br>
<p>Professor Watson isn't worried about genetically modified food, either. He
<br>
says the DNA in genetic engineering has not so far killed anyone, while
<br>
almost anything else that begins with a D - daggers, dogs, dynamite,
<br>
dieldrin, drunken drivers and so on - has claimed lives.
<br>
<p>He is all for tough patents on DNA that will help to yield useful drugs,
<br>
but he is worried that one company will end up with a monopoly on lots of
<br>
genes and so slow the research.
<br>
<p>He has more investment in the subject than most. In 1953, while at
<br>
Cambridge, England, the young American Watson and the Englishman Francis
<br>
Crick deciphered the double helix structure of DNA and confirmed that a
<br>
long, fragile molecule in the chromosomes carried the genetic code. That
<br>
is, it contained the blueprint for all life.
<br>
<p>In 1962 he and Crick and Maurice Wilkins of Kings College London - where
<br>
the first telltale x-ray diffraction images of DNA were made - shared the
<br>
Nobel prize. In 1988 Watson was one of a small group which kicked off the
<br>
huge international, publicly funded effort to decipher the entire three
<br>
billion-letter DNA code of the human race.
<br>
<p>This week he was in Britain for the launch of a new book - and to dedicate
<br>
the £50m Franklin-Wilkins building of Kings College London, a building
<br>
which salutes the crystallographer Rosalind Franklin, who died in 1958,
<br>
and Watson's Nobel partner Wilkins. In the year in which scientists will
<br>
announce the first draft of the entire genetic blueprint for humanity,
<br>
three of the four who launched the gene revolution are not only alive but
<br>
still active in science.
<br>
<p>Crick sent a video message from his office at the Salk Institute in La
<br>
Jolla, California. Wilkins, 83, still has a role at Kings. And Watson is
<br>
president of Cold Spring Harbor laboratory in New York, where he turned to
<br>
research into cancer almost 30 years ago.
<br>
<p>His new book is called A Passion for DNA. Most people know him for a
<br>
science classic written in 1968, The Double Helix, a heart-in-mouth
<br>
account of the scramble by hungry young scientists for the biggest prize
<br>
of all.
<br>
<p>The first suggestion that DNA might have something to do with inheritance
<br>
was made in 1944. By then Watson was already a biology student: he had
<br>
entered university in Chicago at 15. By the time he graduated, he knew
<br>
there was only one subject to be in.
<br>
<p>The rest is history. Watson and Crick saw a pattern of evidence that
<br>
others around them had missed and stole the glory. Watson has always said
<br>
he was lucky that the others missed the vital clues.
<br>
<p>He wanted to call The Double Helix something else: Honest Jim. Well,
<br>
Conrad's Lord Jim was popular at the time and so was Kingsley Amis's Lucky
<br>
Jim. The phrase Honest Jim pleased him, annoyed others.
<br>
<p>&quot;People questioned it. Was I honest? Did we steal it away from Rosalind
<br>
Franklin? Francis did not like the book at all. He saw it as an invasion
<br>
of his privacy. But he said: 'Honest Jim? People will take it that you are
<br>
telling the honest truth.' I said: 'No, someone who is called Honest Jim
<br>
is thought to be a crook. It's a car salesman's name.' It was there to
<br>
raise the question of honesty: did we behave in the right way?&quot;
<br>
<p>He isn't troubled by recent alarms in Britain about the hazards of
<br>
genetically modified foods. He says he first fell out with campaigners in
<br>
1975 when biologists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, started working with
<br>
recombinant DNA.
<br>
<p>&quot;I say it was the left: they were against Nixon, they were against Dow
<br>
chemicals, they were against napalm, they were against pollution. So DNA
<br>
was going to be another polluter. E coli was going to give women in the
<br>
biology building cystitis.
<br>
<p>You know, you can't disprove that. You get accusations, but when people
<br>
can't give any numbers to a fear, then you shouldn't take it into account.
<br>
If they say there is a one in 1,000 chance, you can say: why do you say
<br>
there is a one in 1,000 chance?&quot;
<br>
<p>He says some people thought anything to do with genetics was bad. In the
<br>
sixties he served on one of President Kennedy's commissions, to look at
<br>
pesticide use just after Rachel Carson launched her ecological classic
<br>
Silent Spring, which argued that DDT and other toxins were wiping out
<br>
America's birds.
<br>
<p>Watson remembers touring the Mississippi delta, where cotton farmers
<br>
sprayed their fields with toxins 10 times a season, and huge billboards by
<br>
the roadside urged them to use more, and even more powerful, pesticides.
<br>
<p>&quot;So when genetically modified food came you could actually get an insect
<br>
resistance, and I thought great! When I read in the paper that they got
<br>
some gene which was going to prevent potato blight from wiping out the
<br>
Irish again, I thought wonderful!
<br>
<p>But someone from the Sierra Club said: 'Think again, it's going to upset
<br>
the ecology'. I thought: let's just be straightforward. If you don't have
<br>
potato blight it is better for the farmers, particularly if you survive on
<br>
those potatoes.&quot;
