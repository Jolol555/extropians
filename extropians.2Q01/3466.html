Subject: Henson and the Scientologists.
<br>
<p>Since there has been a bit of a dust up over on sci.cryonics, I though I
<br>
would update the list as to what has been going on for a while.  The below
<br>
was posted on alt.religion.scientology by a person who is now out of
<br>
scientology.

<br>
<p>*****************
<br>
<p>This is to my friends around the world who care about Freedom of Speech.
<br>
<p>As has been well posted, Scientology has once more chipped into our
<br>
basic rights and Freedoms re Keith Henson. Here is a quiet man who stood
<br>
outside their compound and picketed in honor of a few people who died at
<br>
their hands. You all know the rest of the story, and if not, please read
<br>
all the posts re Henson.
<br>
<p>Ok, so here's one step we can help on. Write letters! It has been said
<br>
that for every one letter written, it is counts as 100 in. So please
<br>
take the time to write a letter to the ACLU about this violation of
<br>
Freedom of Speech. Please re-post this to whomever you know cares about
<br>
the freedom, as well as real churhes too.

<br>
<a href="http://freehenson.tripod.com">http://freehenson.tripod.com</a>'
<br>
<p>OK? There is the informantion, as well as in many posts. Please write a
<br>
letter!
<br>
It doesn't have to be long or detailed, but just say in your own words
<br>
that there HAS been a violation, and you wouild like their help in
<br>
looking into it.
<br>
<p>The rest  is up to you, but please do write! And write today, or
<br>
tomorrow at the latest.
<br>
<p>My love to all, and may you have a delightful Sunday!!
