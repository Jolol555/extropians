<p>&lt;&lt; I had a long talk with a couple friends last night, husband is an
<br>
&nbsp;emergency room doctor, wife is an emergency room nurse.  We
<br>
&nbsp;discussed cryonics, organ donations, etc, and I came away with
<br>
&nbsp;the notion that one of the biggest challenges facing the cryonaut
<br>
&nbsp;is the fact that the overwhelming majority of the personnel most
<br>
&nbsp;likely to handle my cooling corpse either do not believe in cryonics
<br>
&nbsp;or oppose it philosophically. &gt;&gt;
<br>
So how many mammals have recovered fully from technology induced torpor, I 
<br>
speak not merely of hibernation, but suspended animation? Don't you think 
<br>
that if studies by human volunteers did yield dramatic, results, in freexing 
<br>
and revival, people would flock to support cryo-suspension for people with 
<br>
life-threatening illnesses?  We don't gots that yet  as they say on Jerry 
<br>
Springer, all we have is some frozen heads and a few bodies that have been 
<br>
cooled down
<br>
<p>As far as the original post, by Philosopher Max More, (an excellent one) all 
<br>
I see since then is a kind of disappointment, that a religious school 
<br>
students and staff, might be rather, supportive of hopeful technologies that 
<br>
Extropianism endorses, rather then demonize those technologies.  Which 
<br>
indicates to me that many of the good members of this mailing list are too 
<br>
busy looking for (religious) strawmen to battle with, in order to put the 
<br>
final nail in God's coffin. A waste of energy to be sure.
<br>
<p>Is anyone saying that he shouldn't have wasted his time at the school, or 
<br>
that it is unimportant, or not worthwhile?
