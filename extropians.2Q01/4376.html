<p>&lt;&lt; Clearly stated: I'm a promoter of nanotechnology as the solution to

&nbsp;most of our problems and the means to the realization of most or all

&nbsp;of our aspirations.

<br>
&nbsp;Clearly stated: I think more likely the damned thing will kill us all-
<br>
&nbsp;-so I'm a bit ambivalent about speeding things up. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ah, the many flavored goo's dilemma. I could see human mishandling of this 
<br>
situation certain death. It hardly seems worth it, if all it produces is 
<br>
uncontrolled, automated muck, that absorbs the planet. Unless we can achieve 
<br>
something fabulous through &quot;uploading&quot; or protect the biota that we and 
<br>
&quot;nature&quot; are with nanotech, also, it seems not such a bargain. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A computer which passes 
<br>
the Turing Test is a parlor trick; the test itself is meaningless 
<br>
because its definition of intelligence is meaningless.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Depending on who is asking what question, it may not be a parlor trick. Are 
<br>
we just a parlor trick of nature, are we something more, and is it important?
