[This essay is well worth reading as one of the deeper and more thoughtful 
<br>
expositions of what might be called &quot;entropianism&quot;, and points to the 
<br>
outlines of what could come to be the political and ethical heart of the 
<br>
&quot;anti&quot; movement I study and write about so often.]
<br>
<p>THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME... 
<br>
<p>Could 'bioregionalism' be the way out of our environmental crisis? 
<br>
Kirkpatrick Sale puts the case for the political philosophy he helped to 
<br>
develop.
<br>
<p>IN A few years ago, writing a biography of Christopher Columbus for the 
<br>
quincentenary of his discoveries, I came across a wonderful Spanish term - 
<br>
querencia - usually translated as 'love of home'. It is that, to be sure, but 
<br>
colloquially it means much more than that too, as I came to learn. Querencia 
<br>
is the deep sense of inner wellbeing that comes from knowing a particular 
<br>
place on the Earth; its daily and seasonal patterns, its fruits and scents, 
<br>
its soils and birdsongs. A place where, whenever you return to it, your soul 
<br>
releases an inner sigh of recognition and realisation. 
<br>
That is pretty much what bioregionalism is. There's more to it, of course, 
<br>
and I'll get to that, and why it matters. But it is useful to look at 
<br>
Columbus for a bit, for he is a part of the problem (as well as carrier of 
<br>
the problem) for which querencia - and bioregionalism itself - is the 
<br>
solution. 
<br>
<p>EXAMINING THE PROBLEM 
<br>
Columbus never knew a home in all his travels, never experienced a love of 
<br>
place, much less a deep fellowship with any particular part of land or sea. 
<br>
He was in that sense tragically symbolic of the culture from which he sprang, 
<br>
the culture he was to implant in the New World. Europe was a society of 
<br>
restless and rootless people, many repeatedly forced to move to try to escape 
<br>
the ravages of the Plague, others regularly conscripted for faroff wars, some 
<br>
in constant motion like the peripatetic court of Spain. Even peasants were 
<br>
constantly displaced by famine, war, pestilence, crop failure and Lordly 
<br>
whim. In this maelstrom, in which the migrant soul had no way to learn or 
<br>
value nature, the only groundings were those of wealth, materialism, 
<br>
humanism, violence and conquest. It was those that became Europe's gift to 
<br>
the world. 
<br>
And nowhere more so than in the Americas, especially the part settled by 
<br>
successive waves of European immigrants, pushing on from one ocean to the 
<br>
other for three centuries and creating a United States in which mobility, 
<br>
upward and outward, has always been its most treasured characteristic. And if 
<br>
today 20 per cent of its population changes residence every year (as against 
<br>
8 per cent in the UK, for example), where social cohesion is so thin that its 
<br>
murder and incarceration rates are the highest in the world, and the barest 
<br>
minimum of civic participation (ie voting) engages less than half the 
<br>
population at best, and then but once every four years, that is the 
<br>
inevitable result of being what historian Samuel Morison has called a 
<br>
'tenacious but restless race' - never knowing, except in rarest incidences, 
<br>
the comfort of querencia. 
<br>
Surely that is why this nation, and the industrialised system it has spawned, 
<br>
has so little regard for the natural world. We don't live on any one part of 
<br>
the land long enough to know very much about it, and it enters our 
<br>
consciousness mostly only when we wish to exploit it. In that sense Americans 
<br>
today are the true inheritors of the early settlers whom Alexis de 
<br>
Tocqueville described as 'insensible to the wonders of inanimate nature' and 
<br>
'unable to perceive the mighty forests that surround them till they fall 
<br>
beneath the hatchet'. And for all our efforts here in America to establish a 
<br>
huge park system and protect wilderness areas, our truest character is 
<br>
revealed in our unabated urbansuburban sprawl, a paving over of three million 
<br>
acres of US farmland by 1995 and now gobbling up more than twice as much land 
<br>
as just 15 years ago. 
<br>
<p>WHAT IS BIOREGIONALISM?
<br>
Given the consequences today of living in a system devoted to the rapidest 
<br>
exploitation of the natural world for the rapidest accumulation of junk, 
<br>
surely it is not fanciful to feel that some such identification with place as 
<br>
querencia implies is a necessary antidote; and the sooner the better. Surely 
<br>
it makes sense to imagine a society divided into territories and communities 
<br>
where love of place is an inevitable byproduct of a life mindful of natural 
<br>
systems and patterns experienced daily - however far removed this may seem 
<br>
just now for the gigantic, destructive society around us. 
<br>
This is what bioregionalism offers - and why it matters. It is a way of 
<br>
living and thinking which views the world in terms of the actual contours and 
<br>
lifeforms of the Earth - measured by the distinct flora and fauna, the 
<br>
climate and soils, the topology and hydrology, and how all these work 
<br>
together: regions defined by nature, not by legislature. But it does more: it 
<br>
pays respect to these natural ecosystems by seeing them as coherent and 
<br>
empowered social and political entities as well, necessarily living by 
<br>
ecological principles of sustainability dictated by the limits of the land 
<br>
itself. 
<br>
In the United States, it is easiest to think of watersheds as the defining 
<br>
bioregional unit - the Hudson Valley, for example, where I live, or the 
<br>
Potomoc estuary, or the Kansas River area. But there are myriads of other 
<br>
discrete territories, such as deserts, mountain ranges, peninsulas, and 
<br>
islands, that function as bioregions. What gives particular weight and 
<br>
authenticity to viewing America this way is that it conforms remarkably to 
<br>
the way that the original people lived here before the European invasion. 
<br>
A map of Indian settlement areas when treaties were signed with the US 
<br>
government in the 19th century shows that the lands the tribes claimed 
<br>
coincide to a great degree with what we now call bioregions - the Kaw along 
<br>
the Kansas River, for example, the Pawnee in the Platte watershed, the Osage 
<br>
on the Ozark plateau - indicating that people living in close harmony with 
<br>
the land naturally patterned themselves in bioregional ways. 
<br>
Much the same is true of the traditional cultural regions of Europe, too, 
<br>
which to a large degree are shaped by geography - Brittany, for example, is a 
<br>
distinct peninsular plateau, Catalonia follows the Ebro watershed, Wales is 
<br>
the land of the Cambrian Mountains, and so on. 
<br>
A map of Europe's ancient regional divisions - such as Leopold Kohr produced 
<br>
for his wonderful Breakdown of Nations (though incomplete) - shows most of 
<br>
them to have clear geographical foundations, even if a few, like Scotland, 
<br>
actually comprise several bioregions. It is this patterning that reaffirms 
<br>
the bioregional idea as the natural, and once obviously successful, principle 
<br>
for human organisation. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that since this 
<br>
was the way that humans lived for several million years in their ancient 
<br>
tribal societies, this way of life has become embedded in our very genetic 
<br>
makeup and remains always in our souls as the true, desirable configuration 
<br>
of people even when modern experience tries to deny it. Now for a few basics. 
<br>
<p>HOW COULD IT WORK? 
<br>
Obviously the institutions and processes within bioregions would vary as the 
<br>
lands and human experiences on them vary. But inherent in the bioregional 
<br>
vision are several fundamental precepts, rooted in an essentially ecological 
<br>
worldview, that would inform any kind of human settlement. 
<br>
First, an economy guided by what Edward Goldsmith has called the 'laws of 
<br>
ecodynamics' - principally conservation as the 'basic goal of behaviour' and 
<br>
stability as the optimum norm in nature, but including also economic 
<br>
interactions based on cooperation rather than competition, and enterprises 
<br>
governed by regardful selfsufficiency rather than imperialism or globalism. 
<br>
It would have to be careful about drawing down resources, processing, using, 
<br>
and recycling them, and it would follow the general rule of nature that all 
<br>
processes are circular. The goals would be potlatch distribution rather than 
<br>
private accumulation (both within and between communities) and general 
<br>
apportionment of resources rather than individual ownership. 
<br>
Second, a governance based on the ecological law of decentralisation, 
<br>
establishing empowered communities within the empowered bioregion, and 
<br>
eliminating any form of government interference beyond that. Diversity and 
<br>
complementarity, two important ecological values, would guide political 
<br>
forms, encouraging a variety of human settlements and governments that would 
<br>
play distinct roles, all on an equal footing and none superior to any other. 
<br>
Given coherent and limited populations, some forms of democracy would be 
<br>
possible, and even consensus might be a goal, but neither would be necessary 
<br>
as long as political arrangements were voluntary and placespecific. 
<br>
Third, a society following such ecological principles as symbiosis and 
<br>
division, the first directing cooperation among groups and communities within 
<br>
a bioregion - between countryside and town, for example - and the second 
<br>
assuring that none became too large or overbearing. The optimum population of 
<br>
community and region would be easy to determine, knowing that the human 
<br>
community could not grow so large as to harm or dislodge any other floral or 
<br>
faunal community or the air and water shared among them, and groups would 
<br>
need to limit their size or break off and form new settlements if they grew 
<br>
too big. 
<br>
That, at any rate, is the bioregional vision. Yes, it may all seem a bit too, 
<br>
well, capricious; utopian. But what keeps it from being just cloudcuckoo land 
<br>
is the fact that it is based not only on the eternal laws and systems of 
<br>
nature, but on the ways of tribal and ancient peoples who knew and followed 
<br>
those laws and systems. And one thing more: it is a vision, a goal, that 
<br>
inspires people even now, today, and all over the world. 
<br>
Not that they are all consciously bioregional - far from it. But on every 
<br>
continent for the last 50 years there have been - and still are - movements 
<br>
fighting in one way or another against the nationstate paradigm in the name 
<br>
of smaller, regional identities, seeking to run their own affairs their own 
<br>
way. That is very much the bioregional cause, and if most such movements have 
<br>
not marched under an ecological banner and have no particular sense of 
<br>
environmental ethics, they usually battle in the name of a territory 
<br>
recognisably defined by natural systems and a love of them. 
<br>
<p>THE REBIRTH OF REGIONALISM 
<br>
In Europe alone, there are movements in more than three dozen regions seeking 
<br>
to assert their identities (besides the Maastricht Treaty's Committee of the 
<br>
Regions), from Wales and Cornwall to the Basque country and Catalonia, from 
<br>
Lapland and Scania to Pandania and Corsica. Some have ancient roots and some 
<br>
are modern responses to modern problems - as, for example, the Alpine Diamond 
<br>
in the Pennine Alps - but everywhere, as the diplomatic correspondent John 
<br>
Newhouse has written, 'regionalism appears to be Europe's current and future 
<br>
dynamic'. Certainly with what Vaclav Havel has called 'the end of the nation 
<br>
state,' the prospect of a devolution of power to these regions, whether or 
<br>
not supranational forms like the European Union continue to exist, is very 
<br>
real. 
<br>
It was this dynamic that, more than anything else, led to the breakup of 
<br>
Yugoslavia, and, though the results at the moment don't seem to present a 
<br>
very pretty picture, (quite apart from the ugly means of achieving them), the 
<br>
underlying truth of the matter is that 'Yugoslavia' was a madeup patchwork of 
<br>
ethnic bioregions (Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, and 
<br>
Montenegro were all ancient geographically divided regions) that could not 
<br>
possibly last. That, too, is what the breakup of the Soviet Union was all 
<br>
about: the resurgence of a plethora of regional realities that not even the 
<br>
heavy hammer of Communist conformity could do away with. The three Baltic 
<br>
states, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and a host of various 'istans' 
<br>
from the Caspian to Baikal, as well as a hundred other ethnic groups (and 
<br>
languages) with placebased identities - this is the eternal verity of this 
<br>
part of the world, for this is what its geography (and human development 
<br>
within that geography) has fashioned. 
<br>
The revival of regionalism is to be seen everywhere, usually driven by ethnic 
<br>
attachments but always with geographical roots: in Turkey and the Middle 
<br>
East, in the Indian subcontinent, along the Indonesian archipelago and the 
<br>
Philippine chain, in China, everywhere in Africa, in Central and South 
<br>
America. It has been estimated, in fact, that there are 75 regional military 
<br>
forces in existence today, fighting against one nation state or another - 
<br>
some of them wellknown (as in East Timor, Irian Jiya, Kurdistan, Chiapas, 
<br>
Kashmir, Somalia, Ethiopia, Colombia and Peru) but most of them out of the 
<br>
limelight and ignored by the internationalist media. And in the land where 
<br>
bioregionalism started as a movement some 20 years ago, there are 
<br>
unmistakable signs of a resurgent regionalism, though none has taken up arms. 
<br>
<p>BIOREGIONALISM IN AMERICA 
<br>
I suppose it is not news to say that there are, as yet, no actual 
<br>
selfempowered bioregions in the United States, nor are there likely to be in 
<br>
the near future. Nonetheless, according to Alan Ehrenblat, executive editor 
<br>
of Governing magazine, the US Congress 'has ceased to be the primary 
<br>
political instrument for resolving the difficulties of modern American 
<br>
capitalism', and 'people have discovered that the governmental units created 
<br>
long ago are too clumsy to serve them very well'. Thus, there are now more 
<br>
than 30,000 'special district governments' operating at regional and local 
<br>
levels for such things as transportation, energy, water, land use, and 
<br>
education, and the Federal government has decentralised itself for daytoday 
<br>
functioning into 600 regional councils, 488 substate planning districts, and 
<br>
at last count, some 1,932 regional boards, committees, and offices to plan 
<br>
and carry out nationallyfunded services. 
<br>
There are even regional secession movements these days. There is an active 
<br>
group in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles trying to take that 
<br>
bioregion out of that city's unwanted reach. There is an organisation in 
<br>
Maine, including a State legislator, pushing to make the northern mountainous 
<br>
section of the state, so different from the coastal region, into the 51st 
<br>
state. Hawaii actually voted for secession and the right to become an 
<br>
independent nation in a nonbinding referendum in 1996, and Alaska has an 
<br>
Independence Party seeking to put the question of nationhood status on the 
<br>
ballot there. 
<br>
As for the bioregional movement itself, there are now more than 200 
<br>
selfproclaimed bioregional organisations in the United States, and several in 
<br>
Central America and Canada as well. The concept of bioregionalism has been 
<br>
recognised by the Professional Geographers Association and the American 
<br>
Society of Landscape Architects, and has been used by the Government of 
<br>
California to shape 11 watershed organisations in order to develop policies 
<br>
on land use and natural resources. The idea has been quietly coopted too by 
<br>
the Interior Department of the Federal government, which has created Resource 
<br>
Advisory councils and Ecosystem Projects - on bioregional grounds - in a 
<br>
number of Western states, and by the US Forest Service, which has created an 
<br>
Ecosystem Management Division in Fort Collins, Colorado, complete with a map 
<br>
of North American 'ecoregion divisions' that is nothing more than a 
<br>
bioregional blueprint. 
<br>
<p>CAN IT EVER HAPPEN? 
<br>
What it would take for the bioregional movement to go from theory to 
<br>
practice, from scattered environmental organisations to shadow (or even 
<br>
recognised) bioregional governments, is difficult to say. It is not likely to 
<br>
happen soon, even in those parts of the world where the regional passion has 
<br>
taken up arms. 
<br>
Nonetheless, as national governments show themselves increasingly powerless 
<br>
and irrelevant to most people's real needs and passions, alternative forms 
<br>
will be developed and gradually empowered as they provide groundlevel 
<br>
solutions to problems that seem to fly beneath the radar of the nation state. 
<br>
Inevitably, I would suggest, those forms will be bioregional in setting, and 
<br>
eventually, given our genetic need for querencia and our historical 
<br>
experience as landbased people, they will be bioregional in outlook. 
<br>
In The Interpreters, a book written at the height of the Irish Revolution by 
<br>
the author known only as AE, there is a passage in which a group of prisoners 
<br>
sit around discussing what the ideal new world should look like after the 
<br>
revolution. One of them, a philosopher, advances the vision of a unitary 
<br>
world order with a global, scientific, cosmopolitan culture; the sort of 
<br>
justification often put forth nowadays in the name of globalism. Another, the 
<br>
poet Lavelle, argues fervently against this conception, trying to show that 
<br>
the more the world develops its technological superstructure for global 
<br>
commerce and opinion, the farther it gets from its natural roots. 
<br>
If all wisdom was acquired from without,' Lavelle says, 'it might be politic 
<br>
for us to make our culture cosmopolitan. But I believe our best wisdom does 
<br>
not come from without but arises in the soul and is an emanation of the Earth 
<br>
spirit, a voice speaking directly to us as dwellers in this land.' 
<br>
That is the voice of bioregionalism, the truest, more eternal voice of 
<br>
nature. And it directs us to become, as bioregionalists, dwellers in the 
<br>
land. Nothing more, and nothing less will do. x 
<br>
<p>Kirkpatrick Sale is the author of nine books, including Dwellers in the Land: 
<br>
The Bioregional Vision, recently reissued, with a new introduction, by the 
<br>
University of Georgia Press.
