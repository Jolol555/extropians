<p><em>&gt;I was watching a CNN report, on an issue that has been brewing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since last year, when an org funded by Gates of Microsoft, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Larry Elison of Oracle had a 'study' that postulated something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like 1.5 million IT jobs would be created in the USA in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like 5 years. Then this org proceeded to hit Congress, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need for permitting much, more 1H-B applicants. This category of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applicants are non USA people, supposedly needed to keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American technological workhorse from floundering, due to lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough Americans trained in IT.  
</em><br>
<p>It's a matter of perspective. One could argue that there is not a
<br>
shortage of software people, just a shortage of software people who
<br>
are willing to work for what the companies are willing to pay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;my own nasty suspicion, is that this unbelievable, demand, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer geeks, described in the 'report' may merely be a fig leaf
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to use foreign, IT guys and gals to drive down the pay rates of US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proggies. My anger (if it is justified) is not at all targeted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward these foreign workers; but toward their paymasters of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;silicon valley, and their buds in corporate USA. 
</em><br>
<p>Your instincts are correct. These companies are seeking the best
<br>
possible help for the lowest possible cost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Most of you are of  Libertarian in temperament, if not in actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voting pattern. Is it reasonable to be concerned that our economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;living standards may be driven down by what might be a scam? Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there any independent, corroborating, economic studies, that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indicate that we are indeed, in such dire, lack of trained North
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans, that we need to import; lest the wheel of intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commerce poop-out? If the captains of industry are putting such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grand inaccuracy, won't a declining standard of living for USA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IT workers eventually, puncture their profit margins??
</em><br>
<p>The companies are looking after there own best interest, it is only
<br>
common sense that you do the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know I come off looking like a nativist, troglodyte (especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if I am), however I am willing to be corrected.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see you as such. As I stated the companies are seeking to
<br>
maximize their bottom lines, I suggest you do whatever is in
<br>
accordance with your values to maximize yours.
