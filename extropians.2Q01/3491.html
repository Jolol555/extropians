<br>
<p><em>&gt; I prefer to imagine the future as an escalating exponential, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we ride while dodging or solving the problems that appear. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be no End of History, just business as usual but each day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitely grander and more complex than the previous one.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, from inside it will be business as usual.  When we are
<br>
&quot;debating whether the Singularity will arrive in 2008 or 2030
<br>
nanoseconds&quot;, we must remember that, to us, these time frames will
<br>
become hugely vast extents of time.  If they are not yet vast extents
<br>
of time, through which we can accomplish what once took a life time,
<br>
we will not yet have advanced to the point that we are that close to
<br>
the singularity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as you say, there will be no end to History.  Surely one
<br>
of our goals will be to complete a perfect history of all time, or at
<br>
least, first, of all a near perfect history of all close to human
<br>
level life forms.  Even at very steep exponential increases, the
<br>
millions and millions of such difficult jobs will surely take millions
<br>
and millions of years to accomplish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, just adding a friendly SI to the current world is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously going to help. How is it really supposed to make religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanatics nicer?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my favorite scenes in a movie (because it is so absurd)
<br>
is when Yule Brinner (Pharo) finally admits defeat to Charlton Heston
<br>
(Moses) by saying as he sits sulking on his now clearly defeated
<br>
throne: &quot;His God IS God!&quot;.  No real person would ever truly act this
<br>
way!  If there was a God that could truly do something like prove hist
<br>
existence by parting the red sea the way Moses did, Pharo, faced with
<br>
the undeniable fact of its reality, would instantly repent, stop
<br>
fighting, and starting kissing up to such a being.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is, any real SI will be undeniably a God.  Not a
<br>
childish damning vengeful jealous God that throws tantrums and who's
<br>
only supposedly undeniable miracles are to plague and destroy, but it
<br>
will be a God that can answer most all of our questions, give us any
<br>
material things we want, teach us and help us to become immortal....
<br>
and more or less give us anything we want.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason the religious fundamentalists fight and war
<br>
with each other is because they all believe in a different God and
<br>
they think their particular God is God, that he is undeniably so, the
<br>
implication being that all others that do not think the same are the
<br>
enemy and must be destroyed.  But when people really come in contact
<br>
with a Real Undeniable God that can do real good miracles, they will
<br>
finally all say: &quot;Boy, that God IS God&quot; and &quot;My God was nothing even
<br>
close to this!&quot;...  Finally there will be no more reason to fight and
<br>
kill each other!  They will repent, join in, kiss up (to science and
<br>
rationalism), and finally ask - &quot;How do I become like that?! ;) And of
<br>
course, the SI will be able to answer this question.  And guess what,
<br>
it's answer will really work for all like any true miracle should!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our perspective, about the only thing you can be sure of
<br>
is that, whatever it is, it will at least be better than it is today.
<br>
We would never choose something worse than today!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onward
<br>
