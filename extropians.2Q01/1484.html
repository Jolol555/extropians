<p>I strongly suspect the problem is a lack of gene 'imprinting'.
<br>
Germ cell genes are imprinted by the mother and father in an
<br>
effort to cancel out each the &quot;agenda&quot; of the opposite sex.
<br>
I think one of the genes for which this occurs
<br>
is one of the &quot;insulin-like-growth factors&quot;.
<br>
<p>The male wants to promote the growth of large child so
<br>
it is born with a higher birth weight increasing its
<br>
chances of survival.  The female wants to limit the
<br>
available resources that the baby can tap and also keep
<br>
the fetus from becoming so large that the mother dies
<br>
in childbirth.  So the genetic program includes this process
<br>
of 'imprinting' (where the parent &quot;label&quot; the DNA as
<br>
being from the male or the female).  This allows the
<br>
female to put constraints on the male genes that promote
<br>
excessive growth.  There are probably other cases where
<br>
imprinting may occur that we don't understand yet.
<br>
<p>If you use non-germ line cells as the source of the nuclei
<br>
you put into the egg, I suspect they will not have the
<br>
proper imprinting.  I think when the science gets worked
<br>
out here its going to be pretty interesting.  It isn't
<br>
a showstopper for cloning in the long term, but it may
<br>
slow it down a bit (probably a good thing).
