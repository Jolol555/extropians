I have (hopefully) clarified some of my points below; it appears my meaning
<br>
was obscured.

<p>Maybe an MBrain SI would be curious to find out what another of similar
<br>
abilities would think of, after a given period. Assuming that one MBrain
<br>
cannot entirely simulate another (can we assume that?), then a seperate
<br>
MBrain, existing at a distance, potentially knows some incredibly useful
<br>
things. The case for forking new brains, which build from scratch using
<br>
nanospores and information parcels of whatever kind, seems pretty good to
<br>
me. Can two MBrains do considerably more than one? What is the cost of
<br>
sparking off a new MBrain on a distant star? Just about negligable, I'd
<br>
think, meaning that the perceived benefit doesn't need to be too high; this
<br>
is assuming that there is no perceived risk, which I take it that Robert
<br>
postulates there is not (ie: No MBrain wars).
<br>

EM?

<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p><p>[snip]
<br>
<p>I should probably have said EMR here. I am specifically not talking about
<br>
transmission by mass; I'm talking about some frequency of electromagnetic
<br>
radiation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So are we (I'll be there) not entirely limited to *initial* transmission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; using matter? Damien asked the same question on list a while back,
</em><br>
actually,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and I don't remember anyone answering &quot;you can use em as so ....&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The BIG problem that I wasn't clear about earlier is that given the amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;information&quot; that you rapidly get at each end (&gt; 10^40 bits
</em><br>
potentially)
<br>
<em>&gt; one *cannot* communicate any significant fraction of that across
</em><br>
interstellar
<br>
<em>&gt; space using electromagnetic radiation (using any of the &quot;popular&quot; ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in SETI, OSETI, etc.).
</em><br>
<p>I guess I was saying that, even if you could transmit a decent amount of
<br>
information over a long distance using EMR, who/what will receive it at the
<br>
other end, if this is the initial expansion (ie: you've never been able to
<br>
send matter or detect other beings at the destination point).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Major Consequence:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You can *Never* read Encyclopedia Galactica if it transmitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  via electromagnetic radiation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I've thought a bit more about this since I first let my fingers fly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you may be able to get a bit closer using wavelength division
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiplexing at light and UV frequencies but I'm doubtful it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve the problem entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way you transmit information around the galaxy is as high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; density &quot;matter&quot; packets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (There is a possible answer to that, of course; you send out an SI seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blueprint in a form that a low-tech civilisation could intercept and
</em><br>
use.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Very dodgy in many ways, though: Is there life out there to receive it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who's going to receive it; low tech friend or scary higher tech SI
</em><br>
gobbling
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foe? etc etc)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've addressed this in previous discussions.  You never send stuff out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to regions beyond your &quot;light horizon&quot; because you can't guarantee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what will be there when it gets there.  The implication of this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that any colonization or forking off children is likely to be only
</em><br>
&quot;local&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Could you talk more about this? I don't know what &quot;light horizon&quot; is
<br>
(apologies for ignorance).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So it seems that sending modulated EM is not useful, except as follow up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; signals to an initial spread of spores. Except that Robert tells us it
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; too wasteful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you can transmit small stuff like a nanobot design (you do have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GHz data rates) but you *do not* transmit significant fractions of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge base.  If you want high-bandwidth communication you are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be hurling asteroid sized &quot;data packets&quot; back and forth.  They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably quite &quot;pretty&quot; packets as Mike's recent picture showed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hmm... you might want a bit of security on those APIs. Capturing and reverse
<br>
engineering someone else's nanospores could be pretty useful, if you can't
<br>
be bothered sending out your own... capturing their data packets would be
<br>
pretty useful, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; My second point is, given that you've already got matter out there in
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; form, you've had time to put a bunch of relay stations *out there*,
</em><br>
ready to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relay your signal. A big long (long!) line of them could take a signal
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one star to the next, without anywhere near the losses or a super death
</em><br>
ray,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could it not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, the interstellar pony express does seem feasible except when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to ride through Amara's clouds of dust.  The ablation in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably makes them take the long way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What I have been unclear about here, is that I mean lots of physical
<br>
repeater stations, transmitting *EMR* from one to the next. The distance
<br>
between each is short, and they span the distance from one star to the next.
<br>
<p>Do they need to move? Maybe they can orbit in a giant, wide orbit with the
<br>
source and destination stars at the focii of the elipse? Is the closest
<br>
point between star and elipse edge then close enough for initial &amp; final
<br>
transmission?
<br>
<p>To fix that problem, you could probably have secondary local orbiting rings
<br>
of relay stations, which orbit only one star, and which come close to the
<br>
larger double-star focussed orbit. Transmissions go to your local relay
<br>
stations, pass around the the closest point to a relay station in the long
<br>
double-star orbit, transmit to it, then the signal travels around the long
<br>
orbit to the second star, into it's local set of relay stations, then in to
<br>
it's local receiver.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What they are powered with is an interesting problem (the energy they
</em><br>
receive?),
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You want to recover as much as possible.  Magnetic braking of the incoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data packets should get you back most of the launch energy and you simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recycle the matter for outgoing packets (or perhaps you have clever ways
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; do the readout nondestructively, then simply do any necessary rewriting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flipped bits and send the packet on to the next station).
</em><br>
<p>With EMR transmission between stations, I am wondering if the collected
<br>
energy can to some extent be used as signal &amp; as a power source.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My third point (I've a disordered mind) is that the cost of EM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communication might be high, but the speed may justify the cost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I agree of course.  The question is what information is so valuable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the communication justifies the expense?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Transmission: &quot;Hey my sun just went nova!!!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Reply: &quot;Really, we predicted that 3 million years ago...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Probably it's information to do with the actions of peers. Stuff that you
<br>
cant predict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Information is important to us; maybe it'll be important to giant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spaceborn brains? Timelines often makes the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information and noise. Waiting for your sub-c message-in-a-bottle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may not be an option, if others are communicating at light speed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to communicate large volumes of information you only do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it with EMR if you are in *very* close proximity (sub-lt yr distances).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can use IR (or radio) to transmit through the dust clouds that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your information transport packets can't go through but the data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate is going to be pretty darn low.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this may resolve the Fermi Paradox -- SIs only fork off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children when they get *very* close to something (solar system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brown dwarf, etc. that can be rapidly turned into something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can &quot;hold&quot; a download of &gt;10^40 bits.  You have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close enough to it so that you can align billions of lasers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receiving antennas such that you don't waste the energy involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the information transmission and can get the foundation data for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the child across the void while you are still in close proximity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't happen very often because stars don't get that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close that often and navigating an MBrain into close proximity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires the expenditure of a lot of energy and possibly mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and takes a very long time (millions of years minimally).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, this would &quot;predict&quot; that the center regions of galaxies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should grow dark more rapidly than the outer regions of galaxies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (more close enounters providing more forking opportunities).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe we are observing that.  Perhaps SIs close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the centers of galaxies have more to worry about like how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to minimize the cost of staying out of the black hole over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very long term.  They can't afford to worry about offspring,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in large part because they are more concerned about their long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term survival.  Now *this* gets very interesting because it implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one possible path civilizations might follow is &quot;star hopping&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *away* from the center of the galaxy.  You don't &quot;fork&quot; at all --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you transfer yourself en-mass to stars that are &quot;outward&quot; bound.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't want to be on the MBrain Titanic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it gets sucked into oblivion.  Now, this *would* explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why there seems to be more &quot;dark matter&quot; in the outer regions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the galaxies -- those are the neighborhoods where one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can expect to survive the longest.  Long term, you are looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a travel path that minimizes getting sucked into a black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole or colliding with another star and allows you the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities to pick up elements that are in short supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and possibly allows forking opportunities) until you can make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to the &quot;safe&quot; region of intergalactic space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In case this isn't clear, the implication (if this is correct)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that advanced civilizations do *not* expand at a velocity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remotely approaching 'c'.  They expand at the rate at which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can arrange convenient (read inexpensive(?)) interstellar 'forking'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities.  Those probably only occur once in a blue moon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Robert, there is something about your theory that comes to bother me, in the
<br>
above paragraphs. I'll try to explain it.
<br>
<p>When you ascribe motivations to MBrains, they are always about survival and
<br>
energy minimisation. As a consequence, they don't communicate, they don't
<br>
move around too much, they spend energy on things like escaping a black hole
<br>
that might suck them up in a couple of million years.
<br>
<p>This seems to be an entirely purposeless existence. These brains don't do
<br>
anything, they just try to survive. That's fine, there are lots of organisms
<br>
that do that. However, MBrains are I think the maximal resource users of any
<br>
organism that I can imagine. These things swallow whole stars!
<br>
<p>If your goal is survival, there are lots of ways of doing that using a
<br>
damned lot less energy and matter. Firing off zillions of nano spores in all
<br>
directions, containing all your recorded information, might be a start.
<br>
Becoming a spaceborn insect plague that spreads across the universe.. that
<br>
might work.
<br>
<p>What your MBrains actually do with themselves, would seem to be achievable
<br>
using an old Z-80 chip. So why do they need such gigantic brains?
<br>
<p>Basically, I think that you would need a reason to build such enormous
<br>
brains. Pure survival is not that reason; it seems quite clear that the goal
<br>
of survival could be accomplished in a much superior fashion, using the
<br>
simplistic methods you've described (run away from dangerous things and
<br>
don't talk to anyone) by using far less (far less!) resources, and being
<br>
smaller.
<br>
<p>So, an MBrain's primary motivation is either not survival, or else it is
<br>
survival, but in a way so extraordinarily non-obvious that you require a
<br>
whole solar-system worth of computronium to figure it out.
<br>
<p>I think this point must flow through all reasoning about MBrain actions. If
<br>
we cannot know what MBrains are motivated by, we cannot know how they will
<br>
act. Surely, they will be prepared to consume resources to come closer to
<br>
their final goal. So this idea of floating quietly in space, desperately
<br>
conserving local matter, drifting aimlessly toward the heat death of the
<br>
universe... it just seems a bit silly.
