<em>&gt; &gt;'Exploit' means to utilize. Thus, anyone who works for anyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is 'exploited', all raw materials are 'exploited'. If the sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'exploitation' that socialists and union members in industrialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nations complain that occurs in third world nations constitutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;income in excess of the average income, then there is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;exploitation in the imaginations of those who seek to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;obsolescent jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exploit means to take advantage of.
</em><br>
<p>Which may or may not have negative connotations. A potential employer
<br>
takes advantage of the fact that there are people needing employment
<br>
just as employees take advantage of the fact that there are potential
<br>
employers who need employees. The fact that there are employers and
<br>
employees in the world presupposes that relationships of mutual
<br>
exploitation will exist. 
<br>
<p>Why should the same relationship, looked at from one direction, be
<br>
considered negatively? Because of propaganda, because people in labor
<br>
generally tend to overvalue their own contribution to economic output
<br>
while undervaluing the contribution of other inputs like management and
<br>
capital. One reason for this is that the labor movement has for 150
<br>
years been inundated by socialist and communist propaganda about the
<br>
labor theory of value being the only reasonable means of economic
<br>
measurement. Another, less insidious reason why laborers so easily are
<br>
swayed by propaganda about the labor theory of value is that they
<br>
generally lack the training in economics and management to properly
<br>
appreciate the contributions of management and capital into the
<br>
manufacturing process, so those contributions are easily discounted once
<br>
their own labor self-esteem is pumped up by self-aggrandizing arguments.
