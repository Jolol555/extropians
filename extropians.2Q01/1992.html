<p>
Nothing much new here... he is working on a book apparently... he thinks
<br>
we should get a vote before allowing new species creation :-) He still
<br>
comes across as awfully clueless when it comes to having real answers to
<br>
the tough questions.
<br>
<p>Bill Joy's talk with Katrina of Wired on April 5 2001 on CNET Radio:
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>To talk about/criticize this subject you have to accept the underlying
<br>
assumptions.
<br>
It is not an all or not type issue.
<br>
<p>Most people responding fall into two groups: either they deny it will happen, or
<br>
are fatalistic and say there is nothing you can do about it (Newt says we have
<br>
to
<br>
go faster than our enemies).
<br>
<p>He wants a hypocratic oath from scientists in these areas.
<br>
<p>He thinks since there is a chance of total destruction/suffering, that is enough
<br>
to relinquish pursuits of these areas.
<br>
<p>He felt like he got a low response to his article from the technology community.
<br>
<p>He feels due to pace of modern companies, there is not time to discuss these
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p>He fears the schizos doing something irreversible.
<br>
<p>...so far all the talk has been about biological threats (30 minutes into it)...
<br>
<p>He thinks the odds are better than 50/50 that we survive.
<br>
<p>He's surprised people are still reading the Wired article.
<br>
<p>He isn't worried about human-sized robots, but more nanotech or other &quot;foraging&quot;
<br>
robots.
<br>
<p>Stressing again that you have to balance expected future tech pluses versus
<br>
potential
<br>
suffering caused by misuse.
<br>
<p>Evolution has not prepared us for the scenario we are facing.
<br>
<p>Questions from the audience:
<br>
---------------------------
<br>
<p>How do you reconcile relinquishment with civic rights to innovation? He says 1st
<br>
amendment isn't important since many countries function ok without it. He really
<br>
doesn't have an answer to this...
<br>
<p>How is the realm of forbidden knowledge going to be defined? He thinks we should
<br>
talk to the humanities folks (joking?). What he really fears is democratized
<br>
access
<br>
to advanced tech. No real answer here.
<br>
<p>Turning over control to AI because of complexity... this is not Bill Joy's
<br>
concern,
<br>
it is Kaczynski's.
<br>
<p>Example of technology that was relinquished or regulated? People argued against
<br>
doing
<br>
the H-bomb... we decided not to do bioweapons, but Russians cheated. Besides
<br>
that he
<br>
has no answers.
<br>
<p>What's your strategy to affect behavior of government/business? He is writing a
<br>
book
<br>
to explain it to laymen, and present examples of potential problems. He doesn't
<br>
like
<br>
that it gets politicized.
<br>
<p>How will information get into the real world? People will have advanced
<br>
&quot;printing&quot;
<br>
devices that will be able to produce things... biotech labs-at-home-on-a-chip.
<br>
<p>Does he worry about this stuff in his real world job? He works on reliable
<br>
software,
<br>
and thinks reliable software is mainly needed by the &quot;good guys&quot;.
<br>
<p>If we are not the end of evolution, shouldn't we hope that the next species will
<br>
be
<br>
nice to us? He thinks we evolve so slowly (genetically) that the only way this
<br>
will
<br>
happen is to explicity try to create a new species. He thinks we all should get
<br>
a
<br>
vote before allowing this.
