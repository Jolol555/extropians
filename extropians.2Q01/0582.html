<em>&gt; Now, given that a lot of the political conflicts, famines, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpleasantnesses we live with today are scarcity-related, doesn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sense to try to understand how two thirds of the human species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will respond to technologies that promise to make most of the roots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict magically go away?
</em><br>
<p>First, I think people immature enough to truly believe in &quot;technologies
<br>
that promise to make most of the roots of conflict magically go away&quot;
<br>
don't belong in science or technology, because this is a dangerously
<br>
irresponsible attitude. Scarcity has never been the problem. Just the
<br>
opposite; overpopulation creates social problems. Politics and
<br>
distribution failures produce scarcity, but that has to do with misuse of
<br>
technology rather than any lack of technology itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because you don't approve of somebody's beliefs, it does not follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you can safely ignore them.
</em><br>
<p>As I understand it, extropy has nothing to do with &quot;approving&quot; beliefs. It
<br>
has to do with science and technology... which needs to ignore belief
<br>
systems in order to remain objective. The danger lies not in ignoring
<br>
belief systems, but rather in taking them seriously. As long as we can
<br>
still laugh at the absurdities of religion, there is still hope that
<br>
humans will survive the accelerating evolutionary phase transition.
<br>
<p>We won't move into a better future until we defeat religiosity, which is
<br>
the most regressive force now operating in society.
<br>

<br>
<p>Stay hungry,

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
<br>
free will
