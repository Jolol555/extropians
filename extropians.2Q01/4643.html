<p>
The third commandment.
<br>
<p>&quot;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain&quot;
<br>
[&quot;for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name
<br>
in vain&quot;, Exodus 20:7]
<br>
<p>What does it mean? I cannot understand.
<br>
Do not misuse the name of the Lord? Too simple, imo.
<br>
<p>The word &quot;vain&quot; is the Hebrew word &quot;shav&quot;.
<br>
It has a variety of translations, including emptiness, vanity, falsehood,
<br>
nothingness, emptiness of speech, lying, and worthlessness.
<br>
<p>S.
<br>
<p>The Vatican says:
<br>
<p>Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and Lord, 
<br>
God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in accord with 
<br>
or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is truthful and legitimate, 
<br>
an oath highlights the relationship of human speech with God's truth. 
<br>
A false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie.
<br>
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second commandment: 
<br>
&quot;You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not swear 
<br>
falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' But I say to you, 
<br>
Do not swear at all. . . . Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything 
<br>
more than this comes from the evil one.&quot;Jesus teaches that every oath
<br>
involves a reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be 
<br>
honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful 
<br>
awareness of his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock.
