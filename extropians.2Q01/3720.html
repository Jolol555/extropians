Thanks to Jim F. for his enjoyable post, as always.
<br>
<p>But I do want to clear up some mistakes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's this feeling of detachment that makes the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryo, with its air of desperate grasping at straws, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being willing to pay a large monetary price for what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems like a pretty low probability of payoff...
</em><br>
<p>Funded by life insurance, the cost of cryonics is much
<br>
less (for most people) than the cost of a daily visit
<br>
to Burger King (and a lot healthier besides).
<br>
<p>As for the probability of revival, Ralph Merkle puts it
<br>
at seventy percent.  I'd put it at fifty percent.  And
<br>
most of my reservation stems from my concern that social
<br>
forces may destroy the movement eventually (although
<br>
with each passing year that becomes less likely).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It may mean that I can contemplate, with more equanimity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than some, the prospect of sheer nonexistence. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a number of cryonicists are just terrified of the idea.
<br>
As for me, I've already been through it.  I've spent the better
<br>
part of the last few centuries not existing, and, while I have
<br>
nothing good to say about it, at least it wasn't terrifying.
<br>
Even now, I'm already dead in every state of the U.S. except
<br>
California.  Non-existence is really no big deal, I can attest
<br>
from personal experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Maybe that means that I'm morally underdeveloped,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, at least having become a cryonicist propelled me in the
<br>
direction of higher ethics: universalist immortalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and really not a very nice person.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, pshaw.  You know very well that that doesn't follow  :-)
<br>
<p>Lee
