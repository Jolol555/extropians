<p>
In my recent belated addition to the science vs. religion
<br>
thread, I remarked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson wrote, in a recent book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;consilience&quot; -- the idea that the separate fields of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science are converging, slowly but inexorably, into a unified,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compatible story about how the world works...  The persistence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;that old-time religion&quot; in the modern world is simply due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some groups of people having been insufficently exposed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web of consilience...
</em><br>
<p>It crossed my mind today that, since SF author Greg Egan (_Permutation
<br>
City_, _Diaspora_, etc.) is held in such high regard by many folks
<br>
on this list, it's worth mentioning the sophisticated fun that
<br>
Egan has with an idea very similar to a &quot;web of consilience&quot;.  It
<br>
also touches on the simulation thread that has been developing
<br>
for the past few days.
<br>
<p>EGAN SPOILERS BELOW, particularly for _Permutation City_.
<br>
<p>Paul Durham's &quot;dust theory&quot; of reality in _Permutation City_
<br>
consists of the notion that the facts of history comprise a
<br>
logically-consistent story that &quot;finds&quot; itself out of discrete
<br>
particles of a sort of spacetime &quot;dust&quot;.  This theory motivates Durham
<br>
to perform an experiment which results in a simulated world,
<br>
Elysium (containing Permutation City as its centerpiece), being
<br>
run on a potentially infinite computer called the TVC (Turing/
<br>
von Neumann/Chiang) grid.  The seed of the Elysium simulation
<br>
also contains the potential for a natively-evolved form of life,
<br>
derived from a virtual organism called A. Lamberti (A for Autoverse).
<br>
<p>Later in the book, after Elysium has been existence for a while,
<br>
the descendants of A. Lamberti have evolved into intelligent
<br>
creatures (the Lambertians) who have begun to form their own &quot;web of
<br>
consilience&quot; comprising their own consistent network of beliefs about the
<br>
world in which they exist.  Egan imagines that this web of belief acts
<br>
as a powerful attractor that is capable of actually remaking the world --
<br>
reorganizing the dust -- to conform with it.  This is a threat
<br>
to the human Copies of Elysium, because two incompatible
<br>
webs of consilience cannot continue to exist within the same
<br>
story (the same &quot;dust&quot;-based reality) [could Egan possibly have
<br>
intended this as a metaphor for science vs. superstition
<br>
in the real world? ;-&gt; ].
<br>
<p>When the Elysians make contact with the Lambertians in order to
<br>
forestall this conflict (to merge the two incompatible webs of
<br>
consilience into a single, all-encompassing one that will allow
<br>
the Elysians and the Lambertians to continue to coexist in the same
<br>
&quot;story&quot;), disaster strikes when the Lambertians refuse to believe them,
<br>
while at the same time continuing to tighten and refine their
<br>
own consilient web, which will culminate in a Theory of Everything
<br>
(TOE) like that sought by modern physics.  As the Lambertians'
<br>
belief system re-weaves the tapestry of reality
<br>
to conform with it, the Elysians are threatened with annihilation,
<br>
or more precisely, with uncreation, to be made as if they had
<br>
never existed (like fairies, and ghosts, and Moses parting the
<br>
Red Sea in our world).  To escape this, the Elysians must spawn
<br>
a new TVC universe and escape into it, leaving the Lambertians
<br>
behind.  The Lambertians, once they have completed their web of
<br>
consilience, have a plausible account of the creation of their
<br>
world much like that which modern physicists eventually hope
<br>
to achieve about ours, leaving no room for the outlandish story
<br>
of what &quot;actually&quot; happened.
<br>
<p>Here's the text of a remark I e-mailed to a friend a couple of days
<br>
ago, which prompted me to post this message:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Finished the book last night. Now you'll have to explain it to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the heart of it seems to be the rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanciful &quot;Dust Theory&quot; (or as the French article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mention below calls it, &quot;théorie de la poussière&quot;),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Paul Durham works out.  I can't say I understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this very clearly myself, except that it seems to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variation on the &quot;multiple worlds&quot; view of reality, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the raw material of the universe (or multiverse, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Deutsch calls it) is a sort of pile of dust,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consisting of discrete particles of spacetime, each of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can participate in a potentially infinite number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causal sequences.  History, as we see it, is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of linking together this collection of &quot;dust&quot;, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are others too, coexisting and interpenetrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like ripples on the surface of a lake.  Particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; histories are like stories, &quot;finding&quot; themselves out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the dust through the force of their own logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessity (or some damn thing!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The metaphor for all this is, of course, the poem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the beginning of the book whose lines all consist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anagrams of &quot;Permutation City&quot; (the permuted letters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which still manage to suggest meanings resonant with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the story: &quot;Remit not Paucity&quot;, &quot;Rip Tie Cut Toy Man&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.) and which are also used as chapter headings.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just too, too clever.  As a French on-line essay about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book remarks (I wish I really spoke French!): &quot;La théorie de
</em><br>
<em>&gt; la poussière repose sur les fascinations mathématiques des
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permutations, et voilà qu'Egan permute les lettres mêmes du
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mot 'permutation' pour décorer son travail littéraire. Georges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pérec et Raymond Queneau auraient apprécié cette cerise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sur le gâteau.&quot;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; An on-line physics book,

<em>&gt; _Event-Symmetric Space-Time_ by Philip Gibbs

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Chapter 7 &quot;The Principle of Event Symmetry&quot;:

</em><br>
<p>Egan's later novel _Distress_ contains a similar idea -- that
<br>
the current lack of a Theory of Everything (TOE) means
<br>
that certain details of the world are still indeterminate
<br>
in actuality, and that once physicist Violet Mosala (who
<br>
is both Black and female -- a nice touch) completes her
<br>
TOE (the &quot;cherry on the cake&quot; of the network of scientific
<br>
belief :-&gt;), the web of consilience thus completed will act as
<br>
an attractor that remakes the world backward in time
<br>
from that point in conformity with the theory, down to
<br>
the smallest detail.  Before the TOE was created (and **understood**
<br>
by a human mind -- that of a science journalist), the
<br>
world existed in a state similar to quantum superposition,
<br>
but afterward, the wave function has collapsed.
