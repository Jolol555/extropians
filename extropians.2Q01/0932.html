<em>&gt; &gt; The notions that in &quot;heaven&quot; one

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  challenges would arise was a silly (and pretty horrible) parody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No better parody of this idea exists than Mark Twain's &quot;Extract From Captain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stormfield's Visit to Heaven&quot; in &quot;Letters to the Earth,&quot;  Twain's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthumously-published humanist masterpiece.  Also a hilarious send-up of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional Christian myths is &quot;The Diary of Adam and Eve&quot; in the same book.
</em><br>
<p>On the other hand, George Bernard Shaw, in &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot;
<br>
(Act III of _Man and Superman_, 1903), makes Heaven sound very
<br>
much like the Extropy Institute:
<br>
<p>&quot;[H]ell is the home of the unreal and of the seekers for happiness.
<br>
It is the only refuge from heaven, which is, as I tell you, the
<br>
home of the masters of reality, and from earth, which is the home
<br>
of the slaves of reality. The earth is a nursery in which men and
<br>
women play at being heroes and heroines, saints and sinners; but
<br>
they are dragged down from their fool's paradise by their bodies: 
<br>
hunger and cold and thirst, age and decay and disease, death
<br>
above all, make them slaves of reality: thrice a day meals must
<br>
be eaten and digested: thrice a century a new generation must
<br>
be engendered: ages of faith, of romance, and of science are
<br>
all driven at last to have but one prayer, 'Make me a healthy animal.'
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Is there nothing in Heaven but contemplation, Juan? 
<br>
<p>DON JUAN: In the Heaven I seek, no other joy. But there is the
<br>
work of helping Life in its struggle upward. Think of how it
<br>
wastes and scatters itself, how it raises up obstacles to itself
<br>
and destroys itself in its ignorance and blindness. It needs a
<br>
brain, this irresistible force, lest in its ignorance it should
<br>
resist itself. What a piece of work is man! says the poet.
<br>
Yes; but what a blunderer! Here is the highest miracle of organization
<br>
yet attained by life, the most intensely alive thing that exists, the
<br>
most conscious of all the organisms; and yet, how wretched are his
<br>
brains! Stupidity made sordid and cruel by the realities learnt
<br>
from toil and poverty...
<br>
<p>...Life is a force which has made innumerable experiments in organizing
<br>
itself;... the mammoth and the man, the mouse and the megatherium,
<br>
the flies and the fleas and the Fathers of the Church, are all more
<br>
or less successful attempts to build up that raw force into higher
<br>
and higher individuals, the ideal individual being omnipotent, 
<br>
omniscient, infallible, and withal completely, undeludedly
<br>
self-conscious: in short, a god...
<br>
<p>...Life has not measured the success of its attempts at godhead by the
<br>
beauty or bodily perfection of the result, since in both these respects
<br>
the birds, as our friend Aristophanes long ago pointed out, are so 
<br>
extraordinarily superior, with their power of flight and their lovely
<br>
plumage, and, may I add, the touching poetry of their loves and nestings,
<br>
that it is inconceivable that Life, having once produced them, should,
<br>
if love and beauty were her object, start off on another line and labor
<br>
at the clumsy elephant and the hideous ape, whose grandchildren we are...
<br>
<p>Life was driving at brains - at its darling object: an organ by which
<br>
it can attain not only self-consciousness but self-understanding...
<br>
<p>...[T]o Life, the force behind the Man, intellect is a necessity, because
<br>
without it he blunders into death. Just as Life, after ages of struggle,
<br>
evolved that wonderful bodily organ the eye, so that the living organism
<br>
could see where it was going and what was coming to help or threaten it,
<br>
and thus avoid a thousand dangers that formerly slew it, so it is
<br>
evolving today a mind's eye that shall see, not the physical world,
<br>
but the purpose of Life, and thereby enable the individual to work for
<br>
that purpose instead of thwarting and baffling it by setting up
<br>
shortsighted personal aims as at present...
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Do you not know that where there is a will there is a way? That whatever
<br>
Man really wishes to do he will finally discover a means of doing?  Is
<br>
it not the inevitable end of it all that the human will shall say to
<br>
the human brain: Invent me a means by which I can have love, beauty,
<br>
romance, emotion, passion, without their wretched penalties, their
<br>
expenses, their worries, their trials, their illnesses and agonies
<br>
and risks of death, their retinue of servants and nurses and doctors
<br>
and schoolmasters?
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>[T]he philosopher is in the grip of the Life Force. This Life Force
<br>
says to him 'I have done a thousand wonderful things unconsciously by 
<br>
merely willing to live and following the line of least resistance:
<br>
now I want to know myself and my destination, and choose my path; 
<br>
so I have made a special brain - a philosopher's brain - to grasp 
<br>
this knowledge for me as the husbandman's hand grasps the plough for me.
<br>
And this' says the Life Force to the philosopher 'must thou strive to
<br>
do for me until thou diest, when I will make another brain and another
<br>
philosopher to carry on the work.'
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>The philosopher is Nature's pilot...: to be in hell is to drift:
<br>
to be in heaven is to steer.&quot;
