<p>Freeman Dyson wrote something about that result.
<br>
<p>&lt;The superiority of analog-life is not so surprising if you are familiar 
<br>
with the mathematical theory of computable numbers and computable functions. 
<br>
Marian Pour-El and Ian Richards, two mathematicians at the University of Minnesota, 
<br>
proved a theorem twenty years ago that says, in a mathematically precise way, 
<br>
that analog computers are more powerful than digital computers. 
<br>
They give examples of numbers that are proved to be non-computable 
<br>
with digital computers but are computable with a simple kind of analog computer. 
<br>
The essential difference between analog and digital computers is that an analog 
<br>
computer deals directly with continuous variables while a digital computer deals 
<br>
only with discrete variables. Our modern digital computers deal only with zeroes and ones. 
<br>
Their analog computer is a classical field propagating though space and time and
<br>
obeying a linear wave equation. The classical electromagnetic field obeying the Maxwell 
<br>
equations would do the job. Pour-El and Richards show that the field can be focussed 
<br>
on a point in such a way that the strength of the field at that point is not computable 
<br>
by any digital computer, but it can be measured by a simple analog device. 
<br>
The imaginary situation that they consider has nothing to do with biological information. 
<br>
The Pour-El-Richards theorem does not prove that analog-life will survive better in a cold.&gt;
