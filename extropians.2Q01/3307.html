<p>Expressed as you have here, I'd say this position could fairly be 
<br>
characterized as &quot;luddish&quot;.  You say that the &quot;artificial creation of life 
<br>
for the purpose of profit or experimentation â€¦ or spare parts&quot; is wrong (I 
<br>
leave &quot;torture&quot; for later comment).   Without a clearer definition of the 
<br>
terms &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;life&quot;, your position seems indistinguishable from 
<br>
that giving rise to the proposed law under discussion.  Is culturing bacteria 
<br>
&quot;artificial&quot;?  It is certainly &quot;life&quot;.  What about a simple human tissue 
<br>
culture?  Is doing so for the purpose of developing a new drug, which one 
<br>
then sells for economic gain, doing this for &quot;profit&quot; in a way you would 
<br>
oppose?  How about a complete human organ?
<br>
<p>As for &quot;torture&quot; - is an experiment in which cultured pathogenic bacteria are 
<br>
exposed to antibiotics &quot;torture&quot;?  If one ascribes moral subjectivity to the 
<br>
bacteria, then it would certainly seem so.  What if the bacteria are 
<br>
transgenic?  Sounds &quot;artificial&quot; to me.
<br>
<p>Obviously there are degrees and spectra of &quot;life&quot; in a moral sense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; This sort of thing serves as a reminder that what we take as obvious, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; majority of people think is ~really far out there~.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  #Glad to see someone realizes this.
</em><br>
<p>As someone who works in the &quot;mainstream&quot; world of law and governance, I'm 
<br>
well aware of how &quot;really far out there&quot; some of our ideas are.  So were 
<br>
Baruch Spinoza's and, for that matter, Thomas Jefferson's (at least to many 
<br>
people) in their own times.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; It is also a sign that we need to make more inroads in mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; thinking. It is not enough for people to have heard of nanotechnology or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; even know what it is, they better be able to integrate it with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; ethical discourse. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  #Couldn't agree more--yet when morality/ethics issues are raised 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  here, they are ignored at best, dismissed or ridiculed at worst. 'Tis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  troubling, to say the least. The term &quot;techno-cheerleader&quot; (coined 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by..?) is not at all inappropriate.
</em><br>
<p>John, this is simply untrue.  *I* coined the term &quot;techno-cheerleader&quot; (at 
<br>
least here) and for good reason.  But not to characterize the many fine minds 
<br>
who have engaged in many extended discussions of morality and ethics here.  
<br>
Rather, it was to make a caricature of how we COULD be misunderstood, if 
<br>
those discussions were ignored.  It seems you're ignoring them.  Just because 
<br>
every single message in every single thread doesn't contain a moral caution 
<br>
doesn't mean that most of us aren't well aware of the deep moral issues 
<br>
raised by transhumanism.  In fact, extropianism is, in many respects, a 
<br>
statement of moral principles in response to the prospect of transhumanism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  #There is ***in general*** no sense of balance, of restraint, of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  forethought, caution, or consideration of consequences. 
</em><br>
<p>I just don't see how you can reach this conclusion.  Consider the lengthy, 
<br>
recurrent discussion of social transparency and privacy which arises almost 
<br>
every time someone mentions a new development in the technologies of 
<br>
information gathering.  Consider the inevitable moral discussions which 
<br>
accompany consideration of uploading and cognitive transformation 
<br>
technologies.  And the long-running discussion of &quot;augmented&quot; versus 
<br>
&quot;synthetic&quot; minds is nothing if not a protracted exercise in &quot;forethought, 
<br>
caution and consideration of consequences.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Pointing this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  out draws ad hominem attacks--first refuge of those unable to support 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their positions with reason.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not going to get drawn into commenting on the comments about the comments 
<br>
that have been made about meta-meta-meta observations, but I will simply note 
<br>
that your statements above seem to me to be unsupportable generalizations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  #It would be very easy to do a dismissive writeup on the movement, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  presenting the views of the most hotheaded and vocal individuals as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  being typical and representative (taking great care to note their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  affiliations), and print it somewhere prominent. I would not do such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a thing--both because it would (I hope) be inaccurate and also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  because I agree with many of the concepts espoused by transhumanism--
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but others may well.
</em><br>
<p>Saying that you could hurt a group of people by picking out the least 
<br>
appealing members of the group and then depicting them as representative is 
<br>
true but, with respect, so what?  You could do the same thing with any 
<br>
congregation of people, from the most &quot;mainstream&quot; political party to the 
<br>
group of people gathered at the coffee machine at the office.  Sure, we're 
<br>
more vulnerable to such tactics, because our ideas are challenging to the 
<br>
great majority of people.  I'm certainly aware of this and have on occasion 
<br>
spoken strongly against ideas I think have the potential for damaging 
<br>
transhumanism by confused association, especially racism and eugenics.  But I 
<br>
wonder what you would propose as an antidote to the problem you perceive; a 
<br>
&quot;speech code&quot; in which it is mandated that every discussion of advanced 
<br>
technology must be accompanied by a &quot;moral impact statement&quot; less we be 
<br>
mischaracterized as mad scientists?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  #Transhumanists themselves do their cause far more damage than any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  neoluddite opponent could hope to manage. This was the meaning of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;not ready for prime time&quot; comment. The general observations made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with that comment explain why. The Principles and the practice do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  coincide. As I said then, this is a pity.
</em><br>
<p>I won't ask you to &quot;back this up&quot; with examples - you could only do so with 
<br>
an exhaustive analysis of the list's archives.  But I will ask that you 
<br>
suggest some solution to the problem you perceive.
