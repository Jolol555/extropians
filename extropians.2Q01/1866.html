<p>Yes, barn owls also have a temporal precision in the microsecond range
<br>
(~5us) which allows them to pinpoint sounds to within 1 or 2 degrees
<br>
horizonally. This is pretty impressive considering the spikes in the owls
<br>
auditory system has to cope with a temporal jitter of about 40us off their
<br>
prefered phase angles.
<br>
<p>There's evidence(*) to suggest the barn owl uses a neat Hebbian learning
<br>
trick to strengthen those signals in phase, and weaken those that aren't -
<br>
and of course tons of neurons to average together.
<br>
<p>What I really like about this is that it underlines how hard the brain has
<br>
to work just to get a little accuracy over all that noise. An awful lot of
<br>
those neurons are just voices in the crowd in various population encoding
<br>
schemes. My guess is you could do the same as what the brain currently does
<br>
with 2 or 3 magnitudes fewer neurons if they were rate based and reliable.
<br>
That's before you even begin to consider the huge speed advantages
<br>
artificial neurons have.
<br>
<p>Evolution has done an amazing job to get so far. I mean who would have
<br>
thought it - computation with living cells? Boy are *we* history!
