<p><em>&gt; &gt;If you fully believe in the potential or rather, if you fully

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Attempts to predict the future of technology are usually only

</em><br>
<em>&gt; future that no one can accurately predict what will be feasible and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not. 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, you really don't understand, do you?  Nanotech is within a
<br>
generation or just a hair more. Not in the far future.  Ditto for AI. 
<br>
Uploading may take another generation.  If we don't start preparing
<br>
ourselves as best we can for this rate and kinds of change we will be
<br>
caught [more] dangerously flat-footed. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We know there will be nanotech, but what will it's limitations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There WILL be some.  Nanotech is not magic. 
</em><br>
<p>Compared to today's technology?  It is pretty darned magical.  Enough so
<br>
to stand the entire industrial and agricultural basis on its head in the
<br>
few decades after its general availability.  Enough to change utterly
<br>
the face of medicine.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And AI.......well that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a century away or more and even then who knows? 
</em><br>
<p>Your timetable is seriously askew and perhaps skewed to serve your
<br>
position.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Genetics is tried and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a path that any tranhumanist currently alive will have to take.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  No one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has ever come close to anything like an AI or uploading.  The number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pitfalls are horrendous.  I am not saying that eventually these will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about but I feel that for myself, and anyone remotely my age,  that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best bet for a continued existence is through genetics.  I won't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the sociology of people turning themselves into robots.  I myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being human.  What would you be without your humanity?  Something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe,  but then again maybe you'll end up a lonely lost set of data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make believe world that some AI programmed.  What is the point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?
</em><br>
<p>If that were the best we could come up with rather than your own limited
<br>
characterization of the near endless possibilities ahead of us, then
<br>
there would be no point.  
<br>
<p>What do you mean by &quot;robot&quot;?  If you mean a walking toaster then I don't
<br>
think anyone here has any such plans.  If you mean being able to pick
<br>
and choose embodiments to suit your purpose and needs at the time then I
<br>
very much look forward to the day when we have such freedom and I strive
<br>
to be around to see it.
<br>
<p>Genetics does not give continuing existence for you personally. 
<br>
Genetics will enable us to produce healthier, more intelligent and
<br>
longer lived children.  By the time they are adults a couple of decades
<br>
will have past of ever accelerating progress.  They will see ubiquitous
<br>
computing before their first decade (equivalently, being continuously
<br>
wired to the degree one wants to be).  They will most like see nanotech
<br>
flowering by age 15 and human level computer densities commonly
<br>
available a decade earlier than Kurzweil predicts, by the time they are
<br>
20.  They will have the option in their child-bearing years to have
<br>
general or not, the natural way or not (unless politics bars it). 
<br>
Before they are 50, death by known disease will be no more except for
<br>
those who elect to shun the treatments that cure all the diseases.   
<br>
<p>They will probably look back at even my crystal ball gazing and be
<br>
amazed by how pedestrian some of my predictions were compared to what
<br>
really happened.
