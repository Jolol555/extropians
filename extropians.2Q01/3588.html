Hi Eugene,

<em>&gt; Sure, current languages are broken, but that doesn't mean much: the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree. But progress is usually made with baby steps, not jumps. When the needs
<br>
are demonstrated, the solutions will follow. Hardware is very conservative ---
<br>
many have been burned by providing something that was eventually not supported.
<br>
Practically nobody will throw a technology on the market without knowing how it
<br>
will be used. Even fascinating technologies such as FPGA are marginalized,
<br>
because they're too radical. And in any case, before you implement something in
<br>
hardware, it has to be simulated and demonstrated in software.
<br>
<p>An interesting challenge is how to work well with architectures such as CA's.
<br>
Right now it seems that they're used either as a machine code equivalent for
<br>
logic expressed as &quot;traditional&quot; serial code, or for evolved computational
<br>
circuits. It seems to me that a new generation of significantly more
<br>
sophisticated tools are required to take advantages of notions like heuristics
<br>
or modules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No. We need something which can twiddle huge amounts of little integers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very quickly. Because of relativistic latency and fanout limitations you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have strong signalling locality. You can't program in an environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this, despite it being provably optimal. Human mind can't handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literally billions simultaneous streams of control flow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Luckily, you don't have to. You'll define boundary conditions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionality metrics, either formally (we're probably smart enough to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, it will be rather tedious, though), or informally (in an interactive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaching session, we're certainly smart enough to do that, in a pinch we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can hire even a few chimps), and let the system figure out the pattern of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these little integers, that defines the mapping solving that problem.
</em><br>
<p>I generally agree. The main dilemma is how many heuristics should people
<br>
provide -- on one hand there might be genetic algorithms, on the other
<br>
hand-coded &quot;intelligence&quot;. My position is somewhere in between, as I believe
<br>
yours too.
<br>
<p>Minsky had a nice way of saying it, something along these lines: if natural
<br>
evolution of intelligence took 200 million years, common sense and reason might
<br>
take far less. The quest is for the most efficient approach (thus realistically
<br>
feasible), not the simplest theoretically feasible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; code is too inefficient to be interpreted. Given a task, the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the important tasks into code that executes quickly. And the code that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially often to justify the expenditure of time, can be recompiled into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; FPGAs. And every now and then, the system might provide designs for custom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chips and ask the human guardians for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A truly smart system designs itself in the bootstrap, and it doesn't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow and stupid &quot;guardians&quot;, at least after significantly into bootstrap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phase. You do not want anything like this roaming the current landscape.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be literally the end of the world. It might make sense at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later point of the game, where there are no monkeys, nor a landscape to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roam.
</em><br>
<p>Again, it's a question of efficiency, and the trade-off. We will see who gets
<br>
there first.
<br>
<p>But read carefully at what point and for what purpose was I referring to
<br>
&quot;guardians.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; * Organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that would allow many people to contribute, without breaking the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Deductive thought is just one subsystem, other subsystems are spatial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought, classification, clustering, self-analysis, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope you like it in there, where you're sitting. I've been there myself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; briefly, but thankfully, have gotten better since.
</em><br>
<p>I do not quite understand what you mean here. Could you explain?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't need no compilation//we don't need no flow control.
</em><br>
<p>Even we monkeys have multiple layers of behavior control, some are reflexive and
<br>
fast, others are reflective and flexible.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aleks
