<p><em>&gt;If China suffers economic repercussions because of this perhaps the

</em><br>
<p>No, of course; you will pay, but it won't kill you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They will pay.
</em><br>
<p>But the &quot;they&quot; that will pay are almost entirely those innocent of keeping
<br>
the spy plane/crew.  Isn't a basic tenet of morality around here that you
<br>
don't punish the innocent?
<br>
<p>P.S.  I don't see what's to get so riled up about.  Holding some hostages
<br>
in a hotel for two weeks is awfully mild compared to ongoing wars in
<br>
Congo or Israel, to severe repression in Afghanistan, or even to the
<br>
drug &quot;war&quot; in the US.  As to keeping the spy plane, seriously, what do
<br>
you expect?  The US would do the same if it had stuff to learn from
<br>
their equipment.  If you want to induce good behavior throughout the
<br>
world, there are scads of more significant targets.
