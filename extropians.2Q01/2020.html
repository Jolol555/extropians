A bit of nitpicking on the article Mark Plus forwarded from:
<br>

<em>&gt; Unsustainable Predictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by William L. Anderson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He then &quot;projected&quot; that if world industrial production were to continue
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; grow at its current pace for the next fifty years, it would mean resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demands of one thousand times what they were in 1974. This is all simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math, of course, but it paints a very silly picture of how human beings
</em><br>
act.
<br>
<p>Just to inject a note of sanity, this math does not add up.  Growing by
<br>
a factor of 1000 is ten doublings.  Ten doublings in fifty years is one
<br>
doubling every five years.  In fact, current GWP doubling time is more
<br>
like 15-20 years.  To achieve his factor of 1000 growth at current rates
<br>
will take 150-200 years, not 50 years.  By then we are well into Star
<br>
Trek territory and even without a Singularity it's not so ridiculous
<br>
to imagine an Earth many times richer and a number of other planets and
<br>
space-based installations being colonized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; California, for example, has attempted to impose &quot;sustainable development&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its policies restricting electricity production. When demand soared
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt; in the face of low production, the California legislature then slapped
</em><br>
price
<br>
<em>&gt; controls on the retail sale of electricity. The logical outcomes of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions are apparent even to those with only a cursory knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics: Legislatures cannot produce scarce goods like electricity
</em><br>
simply
<br>
<em>&gt; by issuing threats.
</em><br>
<p>This is not at all how it went.  The price controls were meant to keep
<br>
the prices HIGH, not low.  They were to protect the California utilities
<br>
(largely reduced to middlemen at this point), by enabling them to sell
<br>
at high prices to consumers while benefitting from the predicted low
<br>
prices in the wholesale market.  Once shortages developed, wholesale
<br>
prices shot up and now suddenly the price lock was working against the
<br>
utilities, who lost money by the bushel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given pressure from consumer/voters, for example, the temptation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government is usually to overutilize a good. That is why people are
</em><br>
&quot;loving&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; national parks to death and why subsidized sugar farmers in Florida have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been systematically destroying the Everglades. In both cases, the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system is subordinated to political distribution of goods, and the outcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is always predictable.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know the whole story about the sugar farmers and the Everglades,
<br>
but I doubt that the free market would protect a bunch of stinking
<br>
swampland.  The only way to make money off it would be tourism and
<br>
charity, and the demand won't be large enough to protect the vast expanses
<br>
of the Everglades.  So someone pushing free market solutions is a bit
<br>
hypocritical if they imply that markets would save the Everglades.
<br>
They'll save a little piece of them, a DisneyGlades with swamp rides,
<br>
but not 5000 square miles.
<br>
