Hal &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20How%20To%20Live%20In%20A%20Simulation&In-Reply-To=&lt;200103180515.WAA10910@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me briefly give an explicit argument for why simulated beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve the same consideration as real ones.  Basically I will claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is no fundamental difference between a simulated and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real being.  I know this is a radical claim but see if the chain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning below is convincing.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst extropians this isn't that radical of a claim.  It
<br>
seems to be your basic extropian dogma which 99% of extropians seem to
<br>
refuse to question regardless of the evidence against it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Real human beings have all of their consciousness tied up in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain.  The activity of the brain somehow produces the consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes us want to care about them morally.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great so far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We know the brain works by the activity of neural cells which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interact with each other via chemical and electrical messages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Likewise they get information from and send signals to the outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world via similar messages.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is where you start to lose it.  The important thing is, a
<br>
message must have some kind of receiver or final resulting knowledge.
<br>
There is more than messages in our brain.  The messages from our
<br>
sensors ultimately end up being our conscious knowledge.  Conscious
<br>
knowledge isn't a message, it is the result of a message.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signal our tongue produces when it comes in contact with
<br>
sodium chloride results, in our brain, the conscious knowledge that is
<br>
salty.  In order for your argument to hold true some abstract binary
<br>
number must be able to do the same thing as this salty qualia our
<br>
brain uses.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, a sufficiently complex binary number can &quot;causally&quot;
<br>
model anything a salty qualia can, but this is missing the most
<br>
important part of consciousness.  In order to know the true meaning of
<br>
this binary number, you must map it back to salty.  The binary number
<br>
can be represented by a paper tape, ferrite on a disk, the state of
<br>
some transistors on an IC, or buss line...  It doesn't matter to a
<br>
simulation.  But to us it does matter.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people experience &quot;synesthesia&quot; incorrect conscious
<br>
knowledge results from our senses.  Sodium chloride could result in a
<br>
red sensation, for example.  Red could also abstractly represent
<br>
sodium chloride just like a binary number could.  But anyone that
<br>
thinks it doesn't matter whether we represent sodium chloride with
<br>
salty or red - wouldn't they be really off their rocker?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can ask a real conscious person what salt is like.  Some
<br>
day we will be able to eff and communicate these sensations.  We're
<br>
already starting to artificially produce qualia (points of light and
<br>
sounds) via artificial stimulation in blind people, for example.  When
<br>
you ask a simulation what red is like what will it say?  If it is
<br>
being honest it will say it's salty is an abstract number and not like
<br>
anything.  When you want to eff with a simulation so that you can know
<br>
what it's representation of salt is like, how could it be possible for
<br>
it to have anything to eff?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have enough ability to perform this Moravekian trick
<br>
and start to replace neurons with other material people will finally
<br>
realize that even if the external behavior remains the same, the
<br>
phenomenal conscious qualites will cease to exist.  The people will
<br>
finally discover (or finally realize what we've all known all along)
<br>
that our consciousness knowledge is constructed of phenomenal qualia.
<br>
Though what this conscious stuff is phenomenally like can be
<br>
simulated, there is nothing really and fundamentally like it.
