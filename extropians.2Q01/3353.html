From: &quot;Brent Allsop&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:allsop@fc.hp.com?Subject=Re:%20Common%20Human%20Errors&In-Reply-To=&lt;0f7401c0d043$c992c800$6c5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">allsop@fc.hp.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; The assumption here is obviously that the hope is in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is not true.  But if someone invests in the stock market, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hope that it will go higher, this is quite justified and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something completely different.  On average, people that invest in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stock market are not &quot;disappointed&quot;.  Given the last 15 years of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investments, I'm certainly not disappointed.
</em><br>
<p>Right, and so there's no reason to &quot;hope&quot; for anything when you've invested
<br>
rationally. It's simply a reasonable expectation. Like tomorrow's sunrise, we
<br>
don't need to &quot;hope&quot; for it, we just have a reasonable expectation that it
<br>
will occur on schedule.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another, I'd call passive or inactive hope.  This would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of a lazy hope.  For example, hoping that some god will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually come down and give us immortality, rather than doing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort ourselves to try to achieve immortality.  As you said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hope is for children. Determination marks the adult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The child hopes the parent will do it for him.  But the parent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is determined to do what is required, in hopes that such efforts will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring what is hoped for.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, except that you can discard the hope meme in favor of reasonable
<br>
expectation (again).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree, having those kinds of hopes are a common human error
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has no redeeming value.  But, when a person makes the effort to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be crynically preserved, when someone donates money to the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cancer Society, in the hope that it will accomplish some good, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of hope, even though some of it occasionally doesn't always turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to be what we'd &quot;hoped&quot; for, such is the driving force that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given us everything humanity has ever accomplished right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are we in agreement?
</em><br>
<p>I think so, yes.
<br>
I've already made too many mistakes on this list to presume that a mere
<br>
semantic correction (or adjustment) can make much difference. What you've
<br>
written here suffices to convince me that raw native intelligence can overcome
<br>
the foibles of using language. Yes, &quot;hope springs eternal,&quot; and all that; and
<br>
you've read between the lines enough to surmise that the intent, rather than
<br>
the dictionary definition of a word is what matters. It occurs to me that we
<br>
are in perfect agreement, and that the only thing that really separates our
<br>
perspectives is the proprietary feelings we have about words themselves.
<br>
Humanity needn't expect (or hope for) precise communication, just the
<br>
recognition that we all perceive reality with slightly different emotions
<br>
about the experience. The important thing is to acknowledge that it's all the
<br>
same identical reality.
<br>
<p>&quot;May we all live in eternity's sunrise,
<br>
on the seashore of endless worlds.&quot;

<p>Useless hypotheses:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
