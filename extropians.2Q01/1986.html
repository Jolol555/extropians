</em><br>
<em>&gt; The National Science Foundation (NSF) has established a major new emphasis on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive neuroscience...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [N]ow, &quot;researchers are starting to come to grips with much more basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive processes that are not tied to diseases,&quot; says Steven J. Breckler,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PhD, director of NSF's social psychology program and acting program director
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for cognitive neuroscience.  &quot;They're looking at fundamental questions such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as how the brain accomplishes memory, thought and reasoning, or how our brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow us to navigate in the world,&quot; he explains. &quot;Some of these questions have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been answered in health-related research, but now the field has gotten to a place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where it wants to take on those questions head-on.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cognitive neuroscience research, with its reliance on sophisticated equipment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and need for specialized technical support, tends to be far more expensivethan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most other areas of behavioral research. A single experiment using functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnetic resonance imaging, for example, can nearly exhaust an investigator's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annual NSF grant budget...
</em><br>
<p>This chimes with some passages from McCrone's _Going Inside_ (which I seem
<br>
bent on waving in everybody's face ;-&gt; ).
<br>
<p>It's striking (but hardly surprising) how much this whole business is
<br>
driven by the availability of technology to conduct research.  When
<br>
the behaviorists were in full force, a book like Donald O. Hebb's
<br>
_The Organization of Behavior_ (1949), which apparently anticipated
<br>
much of what the post-cognitivists (I called them &quot;trans-cognitivists&quot;
<br>
earlier, but I think a more sedate term is better), like Edelman,
<br>
began talking about in the 90's, was dismissed as being completely
<br>
untestable speculation (I've suddenly recovered a memory, whether real
<br>
or false I'm not sure, of checking this book out of a university library
<br>
30 years ago, and being excited by it.  But I was heavily under the
<br>
influence of behaviorism in those days, and Dr. Skinner probably persuaded
<br>
me there wasn't any reason to take it seriously).  When digital computers
<br>
started showing up in universities in the 60's (a must-have toy if there
<br>
ever was one), voila -- cognitivism was all the rage.  Now, functional
<br>
MRI scanners are the must-have toys.
<br>
<p>Oh, I can vouch for what McCrone says about the wariness of folks
<br>
doing animal neuroscience.  In the late 80's, I worked as a 
<br>
programmer for the NYU Robotics Lab, which shared lab space and
<br>
some programming staff with the computational neuroscience project
<br>
(which was apparently a joint venture between the Courant Institute
<br>
[of Mathematical Sciences] and the NYU Medical School).  The comp.
<br>
neurosci. programmers processed the stripy pictures of the visual
<br>
cortices of animals (I don't remember what kind of animals) that had
<br>
been exposed to visual stimuli and then sacrificed.  Apparently, there
<br>
had been an incident involving a visit by a TV crew shortly before my
<br>
time there -- either the visit itself had turned into a confrontation
<br>
over animal rights, or the resulting TV show had been very negative and
<br>
had resulted in bad publicity for the lab.  In any case, the principal
<br>
investigator was **extremely** anti-media.
<br>
<p>Chapter 5, &quot;A Dynamical Computation&quot; (pp. 111-113):
<br>
<p>&quot;Traditional neuroscience was either years of being
<br>
locked away in a basement room dissecting pickled
<br>
brains or else doing experiments on animals -- and no
<br>
one really liked what was involved in electrode
<br>
recordings or brain lesioning work.  The use of
<br>
animals could be justified by the fact that a better
<br>
understanding of the brain should lead to new treatments
<br>
for illnesses like schizophrenia and Alzheimer's.  And
<br>
certainly, taking place at universities and medical
<br>
schools, any work was subject to the closest professional
<br>
scrutiny and much moral debate.  There were strict
<br>
controls on suffering and the prevention of unnecessary
<br>
experiments.  But no matter how solid the arguments,
<br>
animal experimentation tainted the field.
<br>
<p>The stigma was unoubtedly one of the reasons why
<br>
neuroscience appeared so reticent about the subject
<br>
of consciousness all through the single-cell recording
<br>
years...  [E]xperiments on the animal brain had to
<br>
take place in urine-soaked fortresses, deliberately
<br>
anonymous buildings with few windows and entry-phone-
<br>
controlled doors to safeguard against the threat of
<br>
animal rights protestors.
<br>
<p>While NASA and CERN had enormous publicity machines and
<br>
courted the press at every opportunity, neuroscientists
<br>
felt forced to skulk in the shadows, hoping not to
<br>
attract too much notice.  They could hardly invite the
<br>
TV cameras into a recording session where an unaesthetized
<br>
cat dangled in a steel frame, its lungs punctured to
<br>
prevent the gentle motion of breathing from disturbing
<br>
the position of the electrodes in its head...  In such
<br>
an atmosphere, talking brightly about what the results
<br>
might mean for an understanding of consciousness would
<br>
seem dangerously frivolous.
<br>
<p>Scanners changed the study of the mind completely.  They
<br>
were a swell, big-ticket way of doing science that hurt
<br>
nobody...
<br>
<p>For those accustomed to animal work, there was an even
<br>
bigger culture shock.  It was just so easy to do a scanner
<br>
experiment.  A green student could have a good idea,
<br>
scan half a dozen volunteers the next week, and have a
<br>
paper submitted within a couple of months.  Such speed
<br>
was unheard of in an animal lab.  It would take that long
<br>
just to wrangle authorisation for an experiment out of
<br>
a university's ethics committee...  [A] major project
<br>
could take three to five years to complete.  The grinding
<br>
slowness of animal work was yet another reason why
<br>
neuroscience had seemed such a cautious field.  Researchers
<br>
could not afford to take too much risk with an experiment
<br>
because it would take so long to recover from any false
<br>
start.  A wrong move could sideline a career...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Chapter 14, &quot;Answering the Hard Question&quot; (pp. 311-312):
<br>
<p>&quot;[T]he call for a properly dynamic approach [to theorizing
<br>
about the brain] has...  been made frequently enough in
<br>
the past, only to be ignored.  Psychology started with
<br>
Helmholtz and Wundt atttempting to measure the time-
<br>
course of mental events.  In the 1940s, Hebb was particularly
<br>
clear in his descriptions of self-organising nerve
<br>
networks and how they might lead to mental states.  At
<br>
the same time the Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Kohler
<br>
was making his attack on machine theory -- the forerunner
<br>
of cognitive science -- and writing about the principles
<br>
of a dynamic approach in astonishingly modern terms.
<br>
In more recent times, thinkers like Neisser and Edelman
<br>
have only had modest impact.
<br>
<p>However, again the difference may be scanner technology.
<br>
Never before has there been such a direct method for
<br>
studying the human brain and its states.  And not only
<br>
does imaging make the dynamism of the brain nakedly
<br>
apparent, but because of the money and hopes invested in
<br>
the technique, people are having to pay attention to
<br>
the results.  The single-cell recording and brain
<br>
lesioning work that dominated neuroscience during the
<br>
1980s had a low profile even within science itself.
<br>
No one wanted to dwell too much on what was involved in
<br>
experimenting on animals...  But brain scanning is
<br>
exactly the kind of technically dazzling gee-whizzery
<br>
that science likes to put on show.  Having splashed out
<br>
on the machines and hyped up the expectations, the
<br>
neuroscience community will feel it has to deliver
<br>
something.&quot;
