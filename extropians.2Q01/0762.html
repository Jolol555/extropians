<em>&gt; (Would you rather they picked up the equivalent of the green
</em><br>
sky-is-falling
<br>
<em>&gt; evil-GM-will-kill-us meme?)
</em><br>
<p>OK, if you put it that way, let them continue to believe in magic.
<br>
(Just don't let them near the controls.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No disagreement, other than to add that economic problems also arise
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; political ones. And saying &quot;the invisible hand will correct things&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply begging the question -- what happens during the &quot;correction&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>We may find out soon enough...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Technology is a tool. The uses to which it is put are highly dependent
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; the social, religious, and political beliefs of the users. (The uses to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it *can* be put are determined by the laws of nature, I'll grant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.) The point is, how the technologies are deployed (or not) depends
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; what people want to do with them. Which in turn depends on their pre-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>In many cases their pre-existing beliefs depend on what they want to do.
<br>
I've noticed that people tend to believe just about what they want to
<br>
believe. Consequently, technology often acts as the tool which shapes
<br>
social, religious, and political beliefs. &quot;The medium is the message,&quot; and
<br>
all that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're staking out a very dangerous position here -- assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody shares your contempt for religious thinking. Most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't. In fact, if they associate such attitudes with the new
</em><br>
technologies,
<br>
<em>&gt; they'll reject the technologies, because their value system (however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skewed you think it is) will lead them to conclude that those
</em><br>
technologies
<br>
<em>&gt; are inimical.
</em><br>
<p>Right, but most people do have contempt for religious thinking that
<br>
diverges from the thinking of their own religion. All religions believe
<br>
that their's is the one and only true religion. Hence the conclusion: They
<br>
can't all be right, but they *can* all be wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you think you can manage to disentangle your own personal beliefs
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; your analysis of how people who don't share those beliefs might behave?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise, we aren't going to have a very fruitful discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Tell me what you think my &quot;own personal beliefs&quot; are, and I'll tell you
<br>
how I arrived at my disbelief in theology. I learn most from unfruitful
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>ô¿ô
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
<br>
free will
