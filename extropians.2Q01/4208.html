<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE MAY 11 2001
<br>
MAY IS NATIONAL SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH
<br>
<p>May 7 was designated Melanoma Monday.  Melanoma Facts:  Melanoma is now
<br>
the seventh most common type of cancer in the United States.  Although the
<br>
US population increased 10% from 1980 to 1987, the number of melanomas
<br>
increased 83%.  Twenty-five percent of melanoma cases occur in people 39
<br>
years old or younger.  Melanoma is the most frequent cancer among women
<br>
aged 25 to 29 and the second most frequent among women aged 30 to 34.  The
<br>
death rate from melanoma has tripled in the past four decades.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE COVER STORY:  What's wrong with the FDA
<br>
<p><p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Three hundred-fifty cancer treatments
<br>
await approval
<br>
<p>Lack of participants in clinical trials has caused a delay in the approval
<br>
of new cancer therapies, and less options for people facing cancer.  More
<br>
effective and less toxic than their predecessors, new cancer treatments
<br>
have yet to complete the approval process due to a lack of  trial
<br>
volunteers. An estimation of less than three to five percent of cancer
<br>
patients participate in the trials, mostly due to lack of awareness of
<br>
their existence.
<br>
<p>Robert L Comis MD is president of the Coalition of National Cancer
<br>
Cooperative Groups, a network of cancer clinical trial specialists.  He
<br>
announced, &quot;Right now there are 350 new treatments out there ready to be
<br>
tested. If we're stuck at three to four percent of adult patients
<br>
participating in clinical trials, it will be years before these new
<br>
treatments are not only tested but become available once we show that
<br>
they're effective.&quot;
<br>
<p>Clinical trials of cancer drugs involve giving the patient the current
<br>
best known treatment for a particular cancer, or giving cancer patients
<br>
the opportunity to try a new one. Patients receive leading-edge care
<br>
during the studies.  The drugs have already been screened for safety.
<br>
Ellen Stovall, president of the patient advocacy organization, the
<br>
National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, stated, &quot;The most notable
<br>
misconception about clinical trials is that if you participate in a
<br>
clinical you're going to be a guinea pig, or that you are going to get a
<br>
'placebo,' or no treatment. The fact is both of those things are totally
<br>
incorrect.&quot;
<br>
<p>For cancer patients for whom other therapies have failed, participation in
<br>
a clinical trial of a new therapy could offer renewed hope.   For a list
<br>
of some open clinical cancer trials, go to
<br>
<a href="http://www.cancertrialshelp.org/patient_caregiver/trial_list.html">http://www.cancertrialshelp.org/patient_caregiver/trial_list.html</a>
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
<p>Skin Aging
<br>
<p>The sleep hormone (melatonin) and the antistress hormone (DHEA) are both
<br>
found in human skin. Both are converted to other entities with important
<br>
jobs to do.
<br>
<p>Studies show that both DHEA and melatonin are absorbed by skin when
<br>
applied topically. A study from CHUL Research Center (in Canada) shows
<br>
that the activity of DHEA applied topically is 85-90% greater than when
<br>
taken orally (at least in rodents). No special carriers are needed to get
<br>
DHEA and melatonin into skin. A properly formulated topical preparation of
<br>
melatonin and DHEA will contain just enough hormone to benefit skin
<br>
without providing enough to escape into circulation.
<br>
<p>DHEA has another important defense: it keeps chemical carcinogens from
<br>
binding to DNA. According to some very interesting rodent studies
<br>
conducted at Fels Research Institute and Temple University, cancers simply
<br>
can't get started if enough DHEA is present. If this research holds up in
<br>
humans, topically applied DHEA is an exciting prospect for skin cancer.
<br>
<p>Avoidance of more than modest exposure to the sun's ultraviolet light is
<br>
critically important to protect the skin against the oxidizing effects of
<br>
solar radiation. Ultraviolet rays are categorized by wavelengths: UVA,
<br>
UVB, and UVC.  The ozone layer filters out the UVC and much of UVB rays,
<br>
but the ozone layer is not what it used to be, and it seems to have little
<br>
or no effect on UVA rays which make up 90% or more of the sun's radiation
<br>
that reaches the earth. Indeed it is exposure to UVA that causes most of
<br>
the photoaging damage: the premature wrinkles, loss of elasticity,
<br>
hyperpigmentation, and dry and leathery dull texture.
<br>
<p>Rejuvenex with Advanced Vitamin C contains minimal sunscreen protection
<br>
(SPF-12), but ingredients such as vitamin C complex, vitamin E, ceraphyl
<br>
GA-D, vitamin A, and RNA do more to prevent and repair DNA damage than
<br>
even the strongest sunscreen.
<br>
<p>The Dream Cream, also known as RejuveNight, contains all the antiaging
<br>
ingredients (including DHEA and melatonin) to help the skin repair, renew,
<br>
and revitalize itself. Although it was intended as an intensive night
<br>
recovery cream, it can be used any time. The precise DHEA amounts and
<br>
melatonin, together with associated factors, work specifically in the
<br>
epidermis of the skin, not transdermally. There is no sunscreen in the
<br>
Dream Cream, so if using it during the day in the sunlight, the user
<br>
should wear makeup that contains zinc oxide or a sunscreen (and most of
<br>
them do), or use a sunscreen.

<p>Cancer Surgery
<br>
<p>Scientists believe that a primary tumor sends chemicals to signal new
<br>
blood vessels to grow into itself, but at the same time also sends a
<br>
chemical signal that prevents other tumors from growing in other parts of
<br>
the body. Advanced biomedical technology has now pinpointed those signals,
<br>
and most scientists accept that the angiogenesis process (stimulation of
<br>
new blood vessel growth) regulates the growth of metastatic tumors.
<br>
<p>Once the primary tumor is removed, there is nothing to stop other tumors
<br>
from growing elsewhere. That's why some cancer patients often get worse
<br>
after undergoing tumor removal.
<br>
<p>In recent years, several drugs-including interferons, steroids, and
<br>
certain hormonal agents-have been developed to stop or slow angiogenesis.
<br>
In fact, at least 11 anti-angiogenic drugs are now in clinical trials and
<br>
three have proved effective enough to make it to final phase.
<br>
<p>Some of the drugs, like endostatin, are derived from natural proteins,
<br>
while others are based on smaller molecules. Ironically, one promising
<br>
drug on trial now is thalidomide, which once was sold as a sedative which
<br>
caused notorious birth defects in the children of women who took it.
<br>
<p>For more information about human trials of endostatin, call the M.D.
<br>
Anderson Information Line, (800) 392-1611 and select option 3.  For more
<br>
information on current clinical trials from PDQ, the National Cancer
<br>
Institute's database, call the Cancer Information Service, (800) 4-CANCER.
<br>
<p>Physicians may request information about trials from the PDG Search
<br>
Service by calling (800) 345-3300, faxing (800) 380-1575, or e-mailing

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>The Dream Cream
<br>
<p>The Dream Cream contains DHEA and melatonin, both of which protect and
<br>
moisturize skin when applied topically. DHEA protects skin cells from
<br>
injury, particularly thermal injury, and improves blood vessel integrity
<br>
within the skin to help protect cells from oxidative damage. It softens
<br>
rough, dry skin for a moist, dewy look. Topical melatonin protects against
<br>
UV-induced skin damage and skin aging. Research from Zurich University in
<br>
Switzerland has demonstrated the benefits of melatonin as a potent free
<br>
radical scavenger in skin. According to Dr. Nichols Hall, it is during
<br>
slow-wave &quot;delta sleep&quot; that our body recovers from the stress and fatigue
<br>
of daily living. Since melatonin is secreted only at night, applying the
<br>
Dream Cream at bedtime will augment the rejuvenating ingredients your skin
<br>
needs to enhance its ability for repair, renewal and revitalization.

<p>Solar Max
<br>
<p>Formulated by Life Extension scientists Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw Solar
<br>
Max 17 is a waterproof and sweat resistant sunblock that is instantly
<br>
absorbed by the skin and provides the latest scientific protection without
<br>
that greasy messy feeling. Now you can get the UV protection you want
<br>
while moisturizing your skin to feel luxuriously smoother and softer.
<br>
Great for daily use during outdoor activities.
<br>
<p>UV exposure from the sun causes skin damage. Regular use of sunscreens may
<br>
reduce the chance of skin damage, some types of skin cancer, premature
<br>
aging of the skin and harmful effects due to the sun.

<p>LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE COVER STORY
<br>
<p>Congressional committees and investigative journalists have exposed
<br>
massive incompetence, neglect and fraud at the FDA. In the Courts, the
<br>
agency continues to lose critical cases as Federal Judges rule that FDA
<br>
policies are blatantly unconstitutional.
<br>
<p>In the article that begins on the next page, we reveal the most recent
<br>
defeats the FDA has suffered in the Federal Courts. We then follow with a
<br>
report that deals with FDA problems uncovered by Congressional committees
<br>
and investigative journalists.
<br>
<p>For the past 21 years, The Life Extension Foundation has compiled evidence
<br>
indicating that the FDA is the number one cause of death in the United
<br>
States. The FDA causes Americans to die by:
<br>
<p>Delaying the introduction of life saving therapies
<br>
<p>Suppressing safe methods of preventing disease
<br>
<p>Causing the price of drugs to be so high that some Americans do without
<br>
<p>Denying Americans access to effective drugs approved in other countries
<br>
<p>Intimidating those who develop innovative methods to prevent disease
<br>
<p>Approving lethal prescription drugs that kill
<br>
<p>Censoring medical information that would let consumers protect their health
<br>
<p>Censoring medical information that would better educate doctors
<br>
<p>Failing to protect the safety of our food
<br>
<p>Misleading the public about scientific methods to increase longevity
