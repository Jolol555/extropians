<p>Um, how do you know? You been there? There's sure enough hydrogen at the
<br>
poles, if the Prospector data are to be believed. I think there's plenty
<br>
of carbon, due to ditto impacts (and probably plenty ammonia and sulfur,
<br>
too), and natively (graphite, maybe traces of carbonate).
<br>
<p>The bottleneck for people is water, as you need several tons of it/person
<br>
in the ecology. Since you only need to bake out the polar cryotrap
<br>
regolith (the hydrate is probably tightly bound), that's accounted for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - The long lunar night would require lots of batteries, or a nuclear plant.
</em><br>
<p>There are areas which are permanently insolated. Conveniently, located
<br>
in walking distance to the polar cryotraps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pros:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - We know that we have the technology to do it today.
</em><br>
<p>Er, rather make it next Sunday.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - It's only a couple days trip between Earth in case there is an emergency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and food or equipment needs to be sent, and there wouldn't be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muscle-rot during the trip.
</em><br>
<p>Best of all, you can keep your people on the ground. The relativistic
<br>
latency is sufficiently low to allow teleoperation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - You wouldn't need as many solar panels since you'd be getting much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light, and it wouldn't be filtered through an atmosphere.
</em><br>
<p>You can throw solar power satellites into orbit with a linear mass driver.
<br>
With sufficient orbit population there's no more worries about the lunar
<br>
night.
