<p>No, I stole it from Arthur C. Clarke, who nailed it while I

<p><em>&gt; I didn't realize that they were no longer reporting

</em><br>
<p>Note the difficulty in finding out how the humans are
<br>
doing in the Harvard Cup, in which the top U.S.
<br>
grandmasters plus some slashers from overseas
<br>
gather semiannually to play rapid format against the
<br>
commercial software.  The percentages had reached
<br>
about 40% software until about 4 yrs ago,
<br>
when they stopped making the results public.
<br>
At that time they were using 200 MHz Pentium II
<br>
class processors.  I haven't been able to find a
<br>
Harvard Cup or equivalent carbon vs silicon
<br>
competition using the &gt;1 GHz class of processors.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps I just can't find those results, or
<br>
they are for sale somewhere, don't know for sure.
<br>
It could be that the top GMs now realize that they
<br>
are giving away their trade secrets by making those
<br>
games public.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But regardless, any grandmaster today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can still reliably beat any commercial software. Lee
</em><br>
<p>Monday's Chronicle quotes Vladimir Kramnik, the
<br>
young commie grandmaster that recently scalped
<br>
Garry Kasparov:  &quot;We are in a very interesting phase,
<br>
when the strength of the best GMs and that of the best
<br>
chess programs run by the best processors are about
<br>
equal.  Nobody knows what will happen next.&quot;
<br>
<p>I suspect I know what will happen next.  spike
