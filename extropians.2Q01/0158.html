<p>Britain, Australia top U.S. in violent crime
<br>
Rates Down Under increase despite strict gun-control measures
<br>
<p>By Jon Dougherty
<br>
<p>Law enforcement and anti-crime activists regularly claim that the United
<br>
States tops the charts in most crime-rate categories, but a new
<br>
international study says that America's former master -- Great Britain
<br>
-- has much higher levels of crime.
<br>
<p>The International Crime Victims Survey, conducted by Leiden University
<br>
in Holland, found that England and Wales ranked second overall in
<br>
violent crime among industrialized nations.
<br>
<p>Twenty-six percent of English citizens -- roughly one-quarter of the
<br>
population -- have been victimized by violent crime. Australia led the
<br>
list with more than 30 percent of its population victimized.
<br>
<p>The United States didn't even make the &quot;top 10&quot; list of industrialized
<br>
nations whose citizens were victimized by crime.
<br>
<p>Jack Straw, the British home secretary, admitted that &quot;levels of
<br>
victimization are higher than in most comparable countries for most
<br>
categories of crime.&quot;
<br>
<p>Highlights of the study indicated that:
<br>
<p>* The percentage of the population that suffered &quot;contact crime&quot; in
<br>
England and Wales was 3.6 percent, compared with 1.9 percent in the
<br>
United States and 0.4 percent in Japan.
<br>
<p>* Burglary rates in England and Wales were also among the highest
<br>
recorded. Australia (3.9 percent) and Denmark (3.1 per cent) had higher
<br>
rates of burglary with entry than England and Wales (2.8 percent). In
<br>
the U.S., the rate was 2.6 percent, according to 1995 figures;
<br>
<p>* &quot;After Australia and England and Wales, the highest prevalence of crime
<br>
was in Holland (25 percent), Sweden (25 percent) and Canada (24
<br>
percent). The United States, despite its high murder rate, was among the
<br>
middle ranking countries with a 21 percent victimization rate,&quot; the
<br>
London Telegraph said.
<br>
<p>* England and Wales also led in automobile thefts. More than 2.5 percent
<br>
of the population had been victimized by car theft, followed by 2.1
<br>
percent in Australia and 1.9 percent in France. Again, the U.S. was not
<br>
listed among the &quot;top 10&quot; nations.
<br>
<p>* The study found that Australia led in burglary rates, with nearly 4
<br>
percent of the population having been victimized by a burglary. Denmark
<br>
was second with 3.1 percent; the U.S. was listed eighth at about 1.8
<br>
percent.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, the study found that one of the lowest victimization
<br>
rates -- just 15 percent overall -- occurred in Northern Ireland, home
<br>
of the Irish Republican Army and scene of years of terrorist violence.
<br>
<p>Analysts in the U.S. were quick to point out that all of the other
<br>
industrialized nations included in the survey had stringent gun-control
<br>
laws, but were overall much more violent than the U.S.
<br>
<p>Indeed, information on Handgun Control's Center to Prevent Handgun
<br>
Violence website actually praises Australia and attempts to portray
<br>
Australia as a much safer country following strict gun-control measures
<br>
passed by lawmakers in 1996.
<br>
<p>&quot;The next time a credulous friend or acquaintance tells you that
<br>
Australia actually suffered more crime when they got tougher on guns ...
<br>
offer him a Foster's, and tell him the facts,&quot; the CPHV site says.
<br>
<p>&quot;In 1998, the rate at which firearms were used in murder, attempted
<br>
murder, assault, sexual assault and armed robbery went down. In that
<br>
year, the last for which statistics are available, the number of murders
<br>
involving a firearm declined to its lowest point in four years,&quot; says
<br>
CPHV.
<br>
<p>However, the International Crime Victims Survey notes that overall crime
<br>
victimization Down Under rose from 27.8 percent of the population in
<br>
1988, to 28.6 percent in 1991 to over 30 percent in 1999.
<br>
<p>Advocates of less gun control in the U.S. say the drop in gun murder
<br>
rates was more than offset by the overall victimization increase. Also,
<br>
they note that Australia leads the ICVS report in three of four
<br>
categories -- burglary (3.9 percent of the population), violent crime
<br>
(4.1 percent) and overall victimization (about 31 percent).
<br>
<p>Australia is second to England in auto theft (2.1 percent).
<br>
<p>In March 2000, WorldNetDaily reported that since Australia's widespread
<br>
gun ban, violent crime had increased in the country.
<br>
<p>WND reported that, although lawmakers responsible for passing the ban
<br>
promised a safer country, the nation's crime statistics tell a different
<br>
story:
<br>
<p>* Countrywide, homicides are up 3.2 percent.
<br>
* Assaults are up 8.6 percent.
<br>
* Amazingly, armed robberies have climbed nearly 45 percent.
<br>
* In the Australian state of Victoria, gun homicides have climbed 300
<br>
percent.
<br>
* In the 25 years before the gun bans, crime in Australia had been
<br>
dropping steadily.
<br>
* There has been a reported &quot;dramatic increase&quot; in home burglaries
<br>
and assaults on the elderly.
