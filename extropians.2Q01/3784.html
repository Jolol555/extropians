<em>&gt;The part about Robin's paper (<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a>) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have a hardest time understanding is the discussion of common priors.
</em><br>
<p>That's probably because that's the weakest part of our argument :-).
<br>
<p>We note that a list of assumptions, taken together, imply a conclusion
<br>
at odds with observation.  We do not take sides regarding which assumption
<br>
exactly is at fault.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's not clear to me whether the question of whether two humans share
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a common prior is an empirical one, or a matter of definitions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;methodology.  Is it a matter of fact whether you and I share common
</em><br>
<em>&gt;priors?  Or is it a question of which assumptions are most useful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analyze our interactions?  (Or something else?)
</em><br>
<p>It is a theoretical claim with empirical implications.  If we hold
<br>
constant other assumptions, we can test it.  Or we can vary other
<br>
assumptions to try to preserve it against failed tests.  This is the
<br>
usual case in modeling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I also don't understand the claim [1] above relating non-common priors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to lack of truth seeking, unless it is a short-hand for argument B.
</em><br>
<p>It is the weakest part of our argument - I hope to do better in the
<br>
next version.  I want to argue that believing that you are more able
<br>
that others, with no evidence to support that belief, is irrational
<br>
per se.

</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course, since Bayesians draw all correct conclusions from existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;data, they have full, implicit knowledge of all of mathematics and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were completely aware of this result long before Aumann published.
</em><br>
<p>As I mentioned to Curt, this is actually not true - one can describe
<br>
non-logically-omniscient Bayesians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One thing which is unclear in the paper is how you should react if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become convinced that both you and the other party are both rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and fully informed about these results.  ... As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practical matter, what means do you apply to resolve your disagreement?
</em><br>
<p>If you sure you were both so rational and informed, you would be
<br>
absolutely sure that any apparent disagreement was not actually one -
<br>
it was just a random fluctuation that looked like disagreement.  If
<br>
you are not sure, you can reasonably infer that apparent disagreements
<br>
are real, and so you can conclude that you are *not* both so rational
<br>
and informed.   And unless you have reason to be absolutely sure you
<br>
are rational, you should seriously doubt your own rationality.
<br>
&quot;Before taking a mote from another's eye, look to the log in your own.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... Seemingly this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean that if Bayesians John and Mary gradually move closer to an eventual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compromise that they agree upon, this violates the theorem because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could have predicted this path.  Yet it seems obvious that something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like this must be how agreement is reached.
</em><br>
<p>It is far from obvious to me.  Any formal model of Bayesians exchanging
<br>
information, for example, is not like this.
