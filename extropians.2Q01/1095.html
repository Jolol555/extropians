<p>Why, exactly, is it amazing?  You yourself jsut called it a &quot;string of
<br>
pressurized cans&quot;.  I know many engineers who could design and build
<br>
standard pressure vessels of that size and wieght for considerable less
<br>
than was spent. It's not like they have to *go* anywhere once they are in
<br>
orbit.  How is it any more amazing than, say, a submarine?
<br>
<p>I'll grant that the spacecraft that gets it to orbit is &quot;amazing&quot;, but
<br>
compared to that a space station should be fall down simple.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ultimately, though, I think a major propulsion module would have to be added

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's where significant space development ought to be done, absent some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magic propulsion technology.
</em><br>
<p>I believe the sort of inclination change you are talking about is
<br>
prohibitively expensive.  Much cheaper in delivered mass to just start
<br>
over.  However, to be fair, 51 degrees is not a total loss...it would be a
<br>
very good spot for a tourist facility, since it overflys much of the
<br>
planet's land mass.
