<p>Very good for you. Now go get thine ass in gear, and join your university
<br>
of choice. Start doing stuff instead of talking about doing stuff. It's
<br>
fun, but the longer you wait, the harder it gets. Plan to start cranking
<br>
out results by the time you're 25. This means you have to enter the
<br>
academia by the time you're 19, 20 tops, and don't waste these 5 years.
<br>
Don't expect to last much beyond 35 in terms of productive output, unless
<br>
you're an exceptional, hard-working bastard.
<br>
<p>Been there, done that, got the T-shirt. It's too late for me, but it's not
<br>
to late for you. So, quit goofing off (I know you do, since you keep
<br>
posting). Start working.
