<p>
Are the people here speaking about the Bayesian approach to rationality
<br>
familiar with Solomonoff's principle of induction?
<br>
It seems to me that Solomonoff uncovers a bigger part of the picture
<br>
than just the Bayesian deduction principle.
<br>
<p>Ray Solomonoff, one of the co-founders of the field of Algorithmic
<br>
Information Theory, simultaneously with Kolmogorov and Chaitin,
<br>
introduced a nice way to explain how rational induction is possible.
<br>
Roughly said, rational induction consists in dynamically trying to
<br>
find a minimal algorithmic model for the observations of the world;
<br>
when you add new observations, you try to find the minimal model update.
<br>
The actual probability measure is not computable, but can be computably
<br>
approximated from below. It verifies Bayes' theorem with respect to adding
<br>
new information. It depends on an algorithmic context, although up to a
<br>
constant factor, that tends toward one when comparing the outcome of two
<br>
different rational predictors faced with the same long sequences of random
<br>
observations. It thus defeats Karl Popper's limitation against
<br>
context-independent induction, by being context-dependent; yet with an
<br>
asymptotically irrelevant initial context. It is an induction principle
<br>
that neatly formalizes Moore's Law (commonly retro-stated as &quot;pick the
<br>
simplest available explanation&quot;). Now of course, see how a Solomonoff
<br>
predictor can only be _approximated_ by computational agents. This entails
<br>
that we (rational sentient beings, including AIs and ETs) are all irrational,
<br>
when faced with complex enough problems. However, there are convergent
<br>
algorithms to extract all information there is from &quot;simple enough&quot; systems
<br>
that can be described in rules polylogarithmically simpler than the observed
<br>
system. Etc.
<br>
<p>Considering that, I'd rather say of rational agents that they are
<br>
Solomonovian than Bayesian.
<br>
<p>PS: Solomonoff Induction is well-explained in chapter 5 of Li and Vitányi's
<br>
&quot;Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications, 2nd Edition&quot;.

If the human mind were simple enough to understand,
<br>
we'd be too simple to understand it.
