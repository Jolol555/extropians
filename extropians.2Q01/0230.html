<p>I think Roddenberry was an extreme humanist.  He was very 
<br>
pro-technology and pro-human.  However, anything that threatened to 
<br>
change the state of our humanity was banned.  The M-5 computer was 
<br>
evil because it replaced human captains.  Khan was evil because he 
<br>
was engineered beyond human.  Dr. Corbitt was evil because he was an 
<br>
android upload.  Androids always failed.  Data wanted to turn human. 
<br>
Anybody who developed super powers beyond human either 
<br>
self-destructed or transcended out of our universe.  No human 
<br>
advancement or change was ever allowed or considered as a good thing. 
<br>
Even perfect utopian societies were shown to be evil if humans didn't 
<br>
retain their control.
<br>
<p>I don't think Star Trek was anti-technology.  It just didn't take 
<br>
technology to the extremes of enhancing humanity.  Star Trek was so 
<br>
pro-human, that they refused to consider that maybe humans could be 
<br>
improved in some way.  All human improvements were seen as evil human 
<br>
tampering.
