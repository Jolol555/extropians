<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Gene involved in aging in both yeast and worms
<br>
<p>In an article published in the March 8 issue of the journal Nature, MIT
<br>
researchers discovered that the SIR-2 gene, previously discovered to be
<br>
involved in the control of lifespan in yeast, is also involved in the
<br>
aging process of the nematode worm C elegans. The control of the gene over
<br>
lifespan evidently reduces the activity of a signaling pathway
<br>
corresponding to insulin or insulin-like growth factor in mammals. This
<br>
sheds light on a possible mechanism of calorie restriction in lifespan
<br>
extension.
<br>
<p>Gerontologist George Martin has differentiated between &quot;private&quot; aging
<br>
mechanisms, unique to a species, and &quot;public&quot; ones common to all species.
<br>
Calorie, or energy restriction, involves the intake of a lower amount of
<br>
calories without malnutrtion, and is the only proven method of lifespan
<br>
extension in every species in which it has been tested, therefore
<br>
categorized as a public method. Gerontologists studying the yeast S
<br>
cerevisiae had previously discovered that the gene SIR-2 effects aging
<br>
through its control of gene silencing by altering the chromatin:  the DNA,
<br>
RNA and protein that makes up the chromosomes. SIR-2 silences genes at
<br>
various DNA sites, and in a mechanism specific to S cerevisiae, reduces
<br>
extrachromosomal circles of ribosomal DNA that reduce yeast cell lifespan.
<br>
However, the method by which calorie restriction extends lifespan in yeast
<br>
involves a different mechanism of SIR-2, one that may be present in other
<br>
species. Worms bred with an extra copy of sir-2.1, the gene closest to
<br>
SIR-2 in yeast, live 50% longer than worms with the normal single copy.
<br>
<p>The MIT researchers found that sir-2.1 antagonizes the insulin/IGF-1
<br>
pathway. This pathway, which is likely activated in the presence of food,
<br>
inhibits the gene daf-16, which is responsible for encoding a
<br>
transcription factor. When genes in this pathway are mutated, lifespan is
<br>
extended. Sir-2.1 appears to mutate genes in this pathway. Conversely,
<br>
when daf-16 is mutated, the lifespan extension created in worms with the
<br>
extra copy of sir-2.1 is blocked.
<br>
<p>This experiment sheds light on one possible &quot;public&quot; aging mechanism and
<br>
provides a possible explanation of calorie restriction's mechanism of
<br>
action in delaying aging.
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Calorie restriction does not effect bone mineral metabolism or hormones in
<br>
female primates
<br>
<p>Calorie, or energy restriction is a remarkable method of delaying aging
<br>
and death through a reduction in caloric intake which has shown success
<br>
across species in extending maximum lifespan and preventing many diseases
<br>
associated with aging. In exploring energy restriction's effects in male
<br>
rhesus monkeys, it had previously been found to delay sexual and skeletal
<br>
maturity and lower bone mass, despite the numerous benefits it confers.
<br>
<p>Similar effects have been seen in rats. In a study published in the March
<br>
2001 issue of the Journal of Nutrition, researchers from the National
<br>
Institute of Aging attempted to determine if energy restriction has
<br>
similar effects on female rhesus monkeys. Female rhesus monkeys undergo
<br>
menopause and changes in reproductive hormones similar to that of human
<br>
females.
<br>
<p>Forty female rhesus monkeys ranging in age from one to twenty-one were fed
<br>
either a standard diet or a diet consisting of 30% less calories than the
<br>
control diet for six years prior to data collection. The restricted diet
<br>
was formulated to exceed the National Research Council's standards for
<br>
vitamin and mineral status by 30-40% to compensate for the loss of
<br>
vitamins created by lower food intake. No monkeys were postmenopausal at
<br>
the time of the collection of the data.
<br>
<p>While body fat was lowered in the monkeys receiving the restricted
<br>
diet,lean body mass was not. Although bone mineral density tended to be
<br>
lower with age in the restricted group, bone mass controlled for age and
<br>
weight measured at several sites was not effected by energy restriction,
<br>
and correlated with lean body mass, a correlation that has been observed
<br>
in human females. Concentrations of the reproductive hormones estradiol,
<br>
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone and luteinizing hormone
<br>
were not affected by calorie restriction, nor was menstrual cycling,
<br>
although estradiol and FSH declined with age and menstrual cycling began
<br>
to become less frequent in older animals. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin
<br>
D levels were also unaffected. The researchers speculated that females may
<br>
have a different response to calorie restriction than males. Ongoing
<br>
longitudinal studies at the NIA will further elucidate this area.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Osteoporosis
<br>
<p>The primary cause of osteoporosis is hormonal imbalances that interfere
<br>
with the bone-forming cells. The osteoblasts are specialized bone cells
<br>
that function to pull calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus from the blood in
<br>
order to build bone mass. Osteoblasts require the hormone progesterone to
<br>
maintain youthful bone-forming capability during and after menopause.
<br>
<p>For bone mineral maintenance and replacement, the Life Extension
<br>
Foundation recommends that women take between 1000 and 2000 mg of
<br>
elemental calcium along with 600 to 1000 mg of elemental magnesium every
<br>
day. The addition of between 400 and 1000 IU of vitamin D3 is mandatory to
<br>
ensure optimal calcium absorption. The inability to absorb calcium is a
<br>
major reason that calcium therapy fails to prevent or slow the progression
<br>
of osteoporosis. Vitamin D3 taken with calcium will normally promote
<br>
absorption and assimilation of calcium into the bone matrix. Vitamin D3
<br>
has also been shown to promote the production of IGF-1 and other growth
<br>
factors in osteoporotic patients, which improves osteoblast
<br>
(bone-building) function. Other minerals that are important for healthy
<br>
bone metabolism include at least 30 mg a day of elemental zinc, 3 mg a day
<br>
of elemental manganese, and 2 mg of elemental boron a day.

<p><p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Bone Assure
<br>
<p>Bone Assure is a comprehensive formula that can prevent osteoporosis in
<br>
five different ways:
<br>
<p>Protects bone mineral mass by providing potent amounts of elemental
<br>
magnesium and a highly absorbable form of calcium (bis-glycinate) that has
<br>
been shown to assimilate 1.8 times better than calcium citrate.
<br>
<p>Maintains the organic bone matrix with the minerals zinc, manganese,
<br>
silica and copper that are required for the formation of collagen and
<br>
other living connective tissues. Manganese has been shown to specifically
<br>
act as an anabolic catalyst in the development and maintenance of the
<br>
organic bone matrix.
<br>
<p>Facilitates the absorption of calcium into the bloodstream by providing
<br>
vitamin D3. Once in the bloodstream vitamin D3 then acts as a hormone to
<br>
direct calcium into the bone matrix.
<br>
<p>Prevents excessive urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium by providing
<br>
the trace mineral boron.
<br>
<p>Bone assure lowers toxic homocysteine levels that have been shown to
<br>
damage the organic bone matrix by providing small amounts of folic acid,
<br>
B6 and TMG.

<p>Chronoforte
<br>
<p>Getting older is a challenge, but it is the diseases of aging that people
<br>
fear most. Modern medicine has done little to prevent the underlying
<br>
disorders that accelerate the aging process and bring about the
<br>
vulnerability, pain and suffering that we connect with growing old.
<br>
<p>Based on the accumulating body of research showing specific mechanisms by
<br>
which the diseases of aging can be prevented, The Life Extension Buyers
<br>
Club has formulated a product called ChronoForte that provides the
<br>
following in six capsules daily:
<br>
<p>Acetyl-L-carnitine HCL 2000 mg
<br>
Alpha Lipoic acid 300 mg
<br>
Carnosine 1000 mg
<br>
Nettle leaf extract 1000 mg
<br>
Zinc 15 mg
<br>
Selenium 100 mcg
<br>
Biotin 3000 mcg
<br>
<p>A 180 capsule bottle of ChronoForte will last for 30 days based on the
<br>
recommended dose of three capsules, twice a day.
