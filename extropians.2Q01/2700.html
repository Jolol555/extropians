<em>&gt;From: Neal Blaikie &lt;<a href="mailto:nrb@porterville.k12.ca.us?Subject=Re:%20Anti-Capitalism&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104191408.HAA05784@well.com&gt;">nrb@porterville.k12.ca.us</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;You see anti-capitalists as a significant presence? Hmmm. How are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you defining this? As someone who has only been on the list for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about four months, I would say libertarianism is way dominant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here, sometimes to the point of being intolerant of dissenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viewpoints. Since critical thinking is an important principle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropianism, this has always seemed odd to me.
</em><br>
<p>Socialism Vs Capitalism has been debated here many times, as have
<br>
been other dichotomous subjects. Anything appearing as intolerance
<br>
usually comes from long time list dwellers who've heard these same
<br>
arguments before.
<br>
<p>It's kind of like the old joke about guys in prison: &quot;One day these
<br>
guys are sitting around in prison and this new guy is sitting next
<br>
to an old timer, just then one of the prisoners yells out &quot;432&quot; and
<br>
everybody starts to laugh, &quot;what's that about?&quot; asks the newcomer
<br>
&quot;Well, says the old timer, he just told a joke, you see we've been
<br>
here so long that we've heard all the jokes and just refer to them
<br>
by number.&quot; &quot;Really?&quot; asks the newcomer &quot;sure, just watch&quot; says the
<br>
old timer &quot;261&quot; he yells and everybody laughs. &quot;Mind if I try it&quot;
<br>
&quot;No, go right ahead&quot; &quot;168&quot; yells the newcomer, but nobody laughs.
<br>
&quot;What happened he asks,&quot; &quot;isn't 168 funny?&quot; &quot;Oh sure, old 168 is
<br>
one of the best&quot; The old timer tells him &quot;But you didn't tell it
<br>
right.&quot;
