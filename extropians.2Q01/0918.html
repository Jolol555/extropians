<em>&gt; &gt;However the other part of this &quot;if life was all happiness, people would become

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; That sounds like nonsense to me.
</em><br>
<p>But it is a very common meme. I wonder how true it is; if pleasure and
<br>
pain were just a one dimensional scale and exact antonyms it would
<br>
likely be wrong, since any difference in valence would be just as
<br>
useful as the absolute levels. But there are reasons to think rewards
<br>
and punishments are asymmetric, and that might mean there really is a
<br>
need for both. Of course, this doesn't mean pain has any intrinsic
<br>
value, but a signal like that (with the necessary level of
<br>
specificity, aversiveness etc) would be useful.
<br>
<p>Tragedies might be useful training for recognising complex (but
<br>
possibly common) dilemmas where the outcome is a lose-lose situation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, we can say with absolute confidence is that boredom is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be a problem. Boredom is an emotion and already we have means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (drugs etc.) that can reliably dispel boredom for extended periods (albeit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes with side-effects). It is unthinkable that a jupiterbrain SI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't be able to figure out a way of avoiding the boredom emotion if it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chose to.
</em><br>
<p>Did I mention that one of my students implemented a kind of boredom in
<br>
his neural network agent to make it get out of loops? After repeating
<br>
itself too much the &quot;boredom/frustration&quot; (implemented in a rather
<br>
clever low-level way) would build up and make another behavior more
<br>
likely. I think this is the reason why a certain propensity for
<br>
boredom is useful. The problem is tuning it: if the buildup is too
<br>
slow, you become obsessive, if it is too fast you jump from project to
<br>
project.
