<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
April 6,  World Health Day recognizes mental health
<br>
<p>'Open Minds . . . Open Doors.  Prevent and Treat Mental Illness and
<br>
Substance Abuse&quot; is this year's US World Health Day Theme.  The World
<br>
Health Organization has for the first time in history devoted this year's
<br>
World Health Day to the theme of mental health.  World Health Day
<br>
traditionally falls on April 7, but because it falls on a Saturday this
<br>
year a decision was made to hold it on April 6 for the year 2001.  Four
<br>
hundred  million people are estimated to be afflicted with psychological,
<br>
neurological or addictive disorders.  Despite advances being made, victims
<br>
of these conditions are still often stigmatized, blamed and undertreated.
<br>
These disorders often begin in one's teens and can cause immense suffering
<br>
throughout one's life.  Out of the ten leading causes of disability
<br>
worldwide, five are due to psychological illnesses.
<br>
<p>In honor of this year's theme, Life Extension Update would like to stress
<br>
the fact that depression is a frequent problem associated with aging, and
<br>
that nutritional and herbal therapies as well as exercise can be effective
<br>
against both.  A study published in March's American Journal of
<br>
Epidemiology showed that older men and women who were the most physically
<br>
active had the lowest depression scores.  The study followed 404 men and
<br>
540 women aged 50 to 89 at the study's baseline for eleven years.  After
<br>
statistical adjustments, regular, brisk exercise was found to be
<br>
associated with improved mood.  It was observed that the participants who
<br>
took up exercise during the course of the follow up experienced the same
<br>
mood-elevating benefits as those who were exercising at the study's onset.
<br>
However, the study showed that exercise must be maintained to exert its
<br>
antidepressant effect.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOLS
<br>
Depression
<br>
<p>Depression is a serious problem with a biochemical basis. It results from
<br>
an upset in the delicate balance of brain chemicals that regulate mood.
<br>
Depression is a &quot;whole body&quot; disease that skews the way we think and
<br>
behave, often damaging our physical health as well as our emotional state.
<br>
It's a powerful disease that can leave us debilitated, unable to work,
<br>
maintain relationships, or deal with other responsibilities.
<br>
<p>Each year more than 10 million Americans are hit by depression.
<br>
<p>One in five women will suffer from major depression at some time in her
<br>
life, as will 1 in 15 men.
<br>
<p>If you have just one episode of major depression, there's a 50/50 chance
<br>
you'll have more, perhaps as many as one or two a year.
<br>
<p>Millions of depression cases are never diagnosed or treated.
<br>
<p>Untreated, major depression may last for 6 months to a year, becoming more
<br>
frequent and severe.
<br>
<p>Depression costs our society an estimated $44 billion a year, including
<br>
$24.2 billion for lowered productivity and absenteeism at work and $12.3
<br>
billion for medical and psychiatric care.
<br>
<p>More than 18,000 people commit suicide each year, partly or completely as
<br>
a result of depression, costing us $7.5 billion.
<br>
<p>Depression is one of the most commonly misdiagnosed problems. Many doctors
<br>
treat the obvious symptoms of depression, such as poor appetite, insomnia,
<br>
and headaches, but overlook the real problem. Untreated, depression can
<br>
become more frequent and severe, leading to physical and emotional
<br>
suffering, loss of job and relationships, even to suicide.
<br>
<p>It is possible to treat the underlying causes of depression without taking
<br>
synthetic drugs. Several natural remedies have brought relief to many
<br>
people who suffer from depression. Unless otherwise noted, follow dosing
<br>
information on labels. Helpful supplements include:
<br>
<p>SAMe. The safest and most effective antidepressant in the world is the
<br>
European drug S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). SAMe is a simple natural
<br>
metabolite produced from the essential amino acid methionine and adenosine
<br>
triphosphate (ATP) by an enzyme known as MAT (methionine adenosyl
<br>
transferase). It is found in every cell within the body and plays an
<br>
important role in critical biochemical processes. For one thing, it serves
<br>
as a precursor for glutathione, Coenzyme A, cysteine, taurine, and other
<br>
essential compounds.
<br>
<p>Hypericum (St. John's wort). In Germany, where it is covered by health
<br>
insurance as a prescription drug, some 20 million people take hypericum
<br>
for depression.
<br>
<p>Hypericum's side effects are very mild, and may include slight
<br>
gastrointestinal irritation and fatigue. In one study involving more than
<br>
1000 patients, hypericum produced fewer side effects than a placebo.
<br>
However, there are certain light skinned sheep in Australia that become
<br>
more sensitive to the sun and may suffer from serious sunburns after
<br>
grazing on large amounts of the hypericum leaf. This is not a problem with
<br>
people taking the recommended doses of hypericum for depression, but you
<br>
should be aware of the potential problem. Those rare individuals who are
<br>
hypersensitive to the sun, and/or those taking medications such as
<br>
Terramycin, which can increase sun sensitivity, should be cautious about
<br>
taking hypericum, and discuss its use with their physicians.

<p>Alcohol Induced Hangover Prevention
<br>
<p>Because alcohol consumption produces toxic compounds, in the best of all
<br>
possible worlds it would be better not to drink alcohol at all. For those
<br>
who still want to drink, it is possible to do so more safely. The first
<br>
piece of advice would be to drink only moderately and follow this protocol.
<br>
<p>The consumption of alcohol results in the formation of two very toxic
<br>
compounds: acetaldehyde and malondialdehyde. These compounds generate
<br>
massive free radical damage to cells throughout the body. The free radical
<br>
damage generated by these alcohol metabolites creates an effect in the
<br>
body similar to radiation poisoning. That is why people feel so sick the
<br>
day after consuming too much alcohol. If the proper combination of
<br>
antioxidants is taken at the time the alcohol is consumed or before the
<br>
inebriated individual goes to bed, the hangover and much of the cellular
<br>
damage caused by alcohol may be prevented.
<br>
<p>Nutrients that neutralize alcohol by-products and protect cells against
<br>
the damaging effects of alcohol include vitamin C, vitamin B1, the amino
<br>
acids cysteine and glutathione, vitamin E, and selenium. There are several
<br>
commercial preparations that can be taken at the time the alcohol is
<br>
consumed or before bedtime to help prevent a hangover. One of these is
<br>
called Anti-Alcohol Antioxidants. Six capsules of this formula contain the
<br>
proper amounts of antioxidant nutrients to help prevent a hangover.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>SAMe
<br>
<p>SAMe is a natural form of bioactive methionine, sold as an antidepressant
<br>
drug in Europe. SAMe results from the conversion of methionine by ATP and
<br>
SAMe synthetase. SAMe is a &quot;methyl donor&quot; -it contributes a methyl group
<br>
to help other molecules become active. SAMe is utilized by the body in
<br>
three important pathways: methylation (contributing methyl groups); the
<br>
synthesis of polyamines (for cell growth, gene expression, neuron
<br>
regeneration, etc.); and transsulphuration (synthesis of cysteine,
<br>
glutathione and other sulfate groups).

<p>Anti-alcohol Antioxidants
<br>
<p>A remarkable study was reported in which a group of rats were given a dose
<br>
of acetaldehyde large enough to kill 90% of them. Rats given a combination
<br>
of vitamin C, cysteine and vitamin B1 had no deaths. These antioxidants
<br>
provided 100% protection against acetaldehyde induced death. For many
<br>
years, medical interns would give themselves injections of thiamine
<br>
(vitamin B1) to cure a hangover. We now know how vitamin B1 inhibits the
<br>
free radical pathologies. There is now more evidence than ever that
<br>
drinking can be made safer by saturating your body with antioxidants while
<br>
you drink alcoholic beverages.
<br>
<p>Although you can avoid a hangover by taking antioxidants before going to
<br>
bed, a lot of cancer-causing damage can occur before then, so it makes
<br>
sense to bring at least six Anti-Alcohol Antioxidants capsules with you
<br>
when you know you are going to be drinking. Try to get into the habit of
<br>
taking one Anti-Alcohol Antioxidant capsule with each drink.
