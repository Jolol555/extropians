<p>Actually, I have to disagree.  Reports I have heard against power 
<br>
lines were actually based on statistics that indicated a higher 
<br>
incidence of disease in the area of power lines.  The problem was 
<br>
that no direct cause and effect had been determined.  Living near 
<br>
power lines also corresponded with bigger cities, more pollution, 
<br>
utility companies nearby, etc.  It was so hard to prove, that the 
<br>
link was dismissed.
<br>
<p>This is similar to reported problems with Olestra, Aspertame, 
<br>
cell-phones, global warming, violence on TV, etc.  Some early 
<br>
statistics seem to indicate that there might be a problem, but no 
<br>
direct cause can be detected.  Eventually, some of these might also 
<br>
be proven to be problems.  At that time we will wonder why we didn't 
<br>
see it before, and assume that the early complainers must have been 
<br>
&quot;superstitious&quot; to predict the problems before it was scientifically 
<br>
proven.
