</em><br>
<p>Thats one point of my comments -- &quot;intelligence&quot; can't &quot;expand&quot; much beyond
<br>
the boundaries of the solar system.  You have to follow a thermodynamic
<br>
downhill slope and radiate your waste heat outward -- that means that an
<br>
MBrain can't get much larger than a solar system (at least in our situation).
<br>
You don't *want* to get larger because that increases the internode
<br>
propagation delays and drives up your energy costs (if you lose photons
<br>
because you can't confine them to a waveguide because you don't have
<br>
enough material).
<br>
<p>Think of the problem of how much more &quot;intelligent&quot; you would be if you
<br>
moved all the neurons in your brain a meter apart.
<br>
<p>You can perhaps &quot;duplicate&quot; or &quot;grow&quot; intelligence remotely but the
<br>
return on investment seems pretty low because they can only communicate
<br>
a small fraction of what they &quot;know&quot; with each other.   Now, say you
<br>
make the transition from we are now (where interhuman bandwidth is
<br>
very low relative to internal bandwidth) to the posthuman state
<br>
where inter-posthuman bandwidth is very high (I can &quot;know&quot; everything
<br>
that you &quot;know&quot;) -- are you going to want to return to the &quot;human&quot;
<br>
state where you can't communicate much of what you know at all?
<br>
<p>The information cost of leaving the &quot;hive&quot;-mind is very high.
<br>
I suspect most would choose never to do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a discussion of EM vs matter. How is it possible to expand as EM?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no receiver, no way to kickstart a replicator at the other end.
</em><br>
<p>Sure there is, you construct a probe with enough matter to hold the
<br>
MBrain designs, and enough nanoassemblers that some of them are still
<br>
functional after traveling through interstellar space.  You then launch
<br>
swarms of these on interstellar voyages using mass-drivers.  (Decelleration
<br>
on the far side is a bit trickier but you can use things like magnetic
<br>
breaking or simple &quot;tolerance&quot; of crash landing for this to work.
<br>
As soon as they have assembled enough of a receiving antenna, they
<br>
can immediately start to pick up the information flow for any designs
<br>
they couldn't carry &quot;on-board&quot;.  They then proceed to rapidly turn
<br>
the target system into an MBrain or JBrains or Dyson-Nets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So are we (I'll be there) not entirely limited to *initial* transmission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using matter? Damien asked the same question on list a while back, actually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I don't remember anyone answering &quot;you can use em as so ....&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The BIG problem that I wasn't clear about earlier is that given the amount
<br>
of &quot;information&quot; that you rapidly get at each end (&gt; 10^40 bits potentially)
<br>
one *cannot* communicate any significant fraction of that across interstellar
<br>
space using electromagnetic radiation (using any of the &quot;popular&quot; ideas
<br>
in SETI, OSETI, etc.).
<br>
<p>Major Consequence:
<br>
&nbsp;You can *Never* read Encyclopedia Galactica if it transmitted
<br>
&nbsp;via electromagnetic radiation.
<br>
<p>Now, I've thought a bit more about this since I first let my fingers fly
<br>
and you may be able to get a bit closer using wavelength division
<br>
multiplexing at light and UV frequencies but I'm doubtful it will
<br>
solve the problem entirely.
<br>
<p>The only way you transmit information around the galaxy is as high
<br>
density &quot;matter&quot; packets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (There is a possible answer to that, of course; you send out an SI seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blueprint in a form that a low-tech civilisation could intercept and use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very dodgy in many ways, though: Is there life out there to receive it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who's going to receive it; low tech friend or scary higher tech SI gobbling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foe? etc etc)
</em><br>
<p>I've addressed this in previous discussions.  You never send stuff out
<br>
to regions beyond your &quot;light horizon&quot; because you can't guarantee
<br>
what will be there when it gets there.  The implication of this is
<br>
that any colonization or forking off children is likely to be only &quot;local&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it seems that sending modulated EM is not useful, except as follow up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals to an initial spread of spores. Except that Robert tells us it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too wasteful.
</em><br>
<p>I think you can transmit small stuff like a nanobot design (you do have
<br>
GHz data rates) but you *do not* transmit significant fractions of your
<br>
knowledge base.  If you want high-bandwidth communication you are going
<br>
to be hurling asteroid sized &quot;data packets&quot; back and forth.  They are
<br>
probably quite &quot;pretty&quot; packets as Mike's recent picture showed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My second point is, given that you've already got matter out there in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form, you've had time to put a bunch of relay stations *out there*, ready to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relay your signal. A big long (long!) line of them could take a signal from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one star to the next, without anywhere near the losses or a super death ray,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could it not?
</em><br>
<p>Yep, the interstellar pony express does seem feasible except when they
<br>
have to ride through Amara's clouds of dust.  The ablation in those
<br>
probably makes them take the long way around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What they are powered with is an interesting problem (the energy they receive?),
</em><br>
<p>You want to recover as much as possible.  Magnetic braking of the incoming
<br>
data packets should get you back most of the launch energy and you simply
<br>
recycle the matter for outgoing packets (or perhaps you have clever ways to
<br>
do the readout nondestructively, then simply do any necessary rewriting
<br>
flipped bits and send the packet on to the next station).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which should overall use less energy in communicating at (damned near) C
</em><br>
<p>Nope, as the JBIS Project Deadalus study and others that Spike and I have been
<br>
bouncing back and forth as your velocity increases so too does your ablation
<br>
by the interstellar hydrogen ions.  There is a very clear tradeoff between
<br>
how fast you want the information and how much of your information carrier
<br>
is left when it arrives.  [I suppose that one could argue that you
<br>
can simply extract matter from your star and use it for the packets
<br>
but that is draining your gas tank to talk on the telephone.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My third point (I've a disordered mind) is that the cost of EM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication might be high, but the speed may justify the cost.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree of course.  The question is what information is so valuable
<br>
that the communication justifies the expense?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission: &quot;Hey my sun just went nova!!!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reply: &quot;Really, we predicted that 3 million years ago...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Information is important to us; maybe it'll be important to giant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spaceborn brains? Timelines often makes the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and noise. Waiting for your sub-c message-in-a-bottle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be an option, if others are communicating at light speed.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to communicate large volumes of information you only do
<br>
it with EMR if you are in *very* close proximity (sub-lt yr distances).
<br>
<p>You can use IR (or radio) to transmit through the dust clouds that
<br>
your information transport packets can't go through but the data
<br>
rate is going to be pretty darn low.
<br>
<p>I think this may resolve the Fermi Paradox -- SIs only fork off
<br>
children when they get *very* close to something (solar system,
<br>
brown dwarf, etc. that can be rapidly turned into something
<br>
that can &quot;hold&quot; a download of &gt;10^40 bits.  You have to be
<br>
close enough to it so that you can align billions of lasers and
<br>
receiving antennas such that you don't waste the energy involved in
<br>
the information transmission and can get the foundation data for
<br>
the child across the void while you are still in close proximity.
<br>
<p>This doesn't happen very often because stars don't get that
<br>
close that often and navigating an MBrain into close proximity
<br>
requires the expenditure of a lot of energy and possibly mass
<br>
and takes a very long time (millions of years minimally).
<br>
<p>Now, this would &quot;predict&quot; that the center regions of galaxies
<br>
should grow dark more rapidly than the outer regions of galaxies
<br>
(more close enounters providing more forking opportunities).
<br>
I don't believe we are observing that.  Perhaps SIs close to
<br>
the centers of galaxies have more to worry about like how
<br>
to minimize the cost of staying out of the black hole over
<br>
the very long term.  They can't afford to worry about offspring,
<br>
in large part because they are more concerned about their long
<br>
term survival.  Now *this* gets very interesting because it implies
<br>
one possible path civilizations might follow is &quot;star hopping&quot;
<br>
*away* from the center of the galaxy.  You don't &quot;fork&quot; at all --
<br>
you transfer yourself en-mass to stars that are &quot;outward&quot; bound.  
<br>
I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't want to be on the MBrain Titanic
<br>
as it gets sucked into oblivion.  Now, this *would* explain
<br>
why there seems to be more &quot;dark matter&quot; in the outer regions
<br>
of the galaxies -- those are the neighborhoods where one
<br>
can expect to survive the longest.  Long term, you are looking
<br>
for a travel path that minimizes getting sucked into a black
<br>
hole or colliding with another star and allows you the greatest
<br>
opportunities to pick up elements that are in short supply
<br>
(and possibly allows forking opportunities) until you can make
<br>
it to the &quot;safe&quot; region of intergalactic space.
<br>
<p>In case this isn't clear, the implication (if this is correct)
<br>
is that advanced civilizations do *not* expand at a velocity
<br>
remotely approaching 'c'.  They expand at the rate at which they
<br>
can arrange convenient (read inexpensive(?)) interstellar 'forking'
<br>
opportunities.  Those probably only occur once in a blue moon.
