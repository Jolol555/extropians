<p><em>&gt; In George Lakoff's words

<em>&gt; ( <a href="http://www.ex.ac.uk/~PErnest/pome10/art21.htm">http://www.ex.ac.uk/~PErnest/pome10/art21.htm</a> )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Functionalism, first formulated by philosopher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hilary Putnam and since repudiated by him, is the theory that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all aspects of mind can be characterized adequately without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at the brain, as if the mind worked via the manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of abstract formal symbols as in a computer program designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent of any particular hardware, but which happened to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of running on the brain's wetware. This computer program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind is not shaped by the details of the brain.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This seems to be a somewhat contradictory definition.  The point is
<br>
that the manner in which you &quot;program&quot; a brain to run an algorithm is
<br>
by arranging the details of neural connection and tissue organization.
<br>
You can't be concerned about the algorithm without being concerned about
<br>
the structural details.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;In the functionalist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view, what is ultimately important for understanding psychology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the algorithms, not the hardware on which they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executed... Furthermore, the tissue organization and composition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the brain shouldn't concern us as long as the algorithm 'runs' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or comes to a successful halt.&quot; (BABF p. 220).
</em><br>
<p>This is like saying that we care in a computer about the program it is
<br>
running, but the contents of its memory and storage shouldn't concern us.
<br>
The problem is, it is the contents of its memory which determine what
<br>
program it runs.  So if we are concerned about the program, we must
<br>
therefore be concerned about the contents of memory.
<br>
<p>In the same way, a functionalist is very much concerned about the
<br>
details of the tissue organization of the brain, because this is what
<br>
determines what program the brain is running.  However he believes that
<br>
the functional activity would equally well give rise to consciousness
<br>
even if it were instantiated in another substrate.  The practical details
<br>
of arranging that instantiation would involve minute, careful study of
<br>
the tissue structure of the brain.
