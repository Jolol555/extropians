<em>&gt; Actually, I have this wacky idea that says it's ethically prohibited to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply Bayesian priors to people.  In other words, you should judge a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's properties - intelligence levels, for example - only by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information that is directly revealing of those properties, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through other properties that happen to be weakly or strongly associated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if those properties happen to be outside the person's direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulative control.
</em><br>
<p>That's a generous position, to judge each person only by their actions
<br>
rather than other attributes.  No doubt in your own case since you are
<br>
a highly unusual person, you would be frequently misjudged when other
<br>
characteristics are used.
<br>
<p>Of course, most people are not unusual on most traits, and the reason
<br>
why people use correlations is because they usually work.  You are
<br>
discarding usually-useful information if you choose to ignore this,
<br>
but in some cases you can probably afford to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, if a nine-year-old were to walk up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me and ask a question that I would take seriously if an adult had asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, I am obliged to answer as I would an adult, and am not permitted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take any action predicated on my knowledge of chronological age until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person in question makes some statement that is actually revealing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nine-year-old characteristics.  (Not in the sense of &quot;being interpretable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as being revealing of youth&quot;, but in the sense of being a statement that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would *only* have been generated by a youth and not by an adult, or a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-probability equivalent of same.)
</em><br>
<p>I suspect that you're going to end up talking over the heads of a lot of
<br>
nine year olds with this policy.  A more practical approach would be to
<br>
ask a few clarifying questions to get an idea of the child's knowledge
<br>
and maturity before attempting to answer.  Maybe the kid really is bright
<br>
and knowledgeable and would appreciate a detailed response, but maybe he
<br>
just accidentally asked a deep question (three year olds are especially
<br>
good at this).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if someone says &quot;I'm smarter than you, Eliezer!&quot; I would certainly feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obliged to assume (or rather, act under the assumption) that the person in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is as likely to be smarter than me as I am to be smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, at least until the person makes some other statement revealing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual intelligence levels, which generally doesn't take too long.
</em><br>
<p>...assuming that you judge such a claim to be indicative of smartness,
<br>
which would presumably depend on the context.
