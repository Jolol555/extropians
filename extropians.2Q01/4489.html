<p>About the ownership rights, it would seem to be like homesteading on the
<br>
frontier.  Large organization might be able to put into place plans that
<br>
could reach these outposts first, as well, small organizations might
<br>
carry out similar plans.  Thus, if people start landing on the moon,
<br>
there is almost first the aesthetic aspect, as almost all the humans on
<br>
Earth can see the moon at various times, thus that a goal of development
<br>
would be to be invisible to the naked eye from Earth.  A low powered
<br>
telescope might be able to see the cities on the moon, which would have
<br>
light emissions controls in particular, to avoid disruption of
<br>
astronomy.
<br>
<p>Then, if the land is considered frontier, then as we have already been
<br>
learning about how we must conserve and respect our planet's resources,
<br>
we would have that perspective as we consider what could actually take
<br>
place within a realistic timespan.  As well, it is recognized that those
<br>
places could form their own governments, as well, they could be a part
<br>
of government on Earth, for example, having a postal code, and some
<br>
would probably be government outposts, for they would be among the
<br>
organizations at that scale.
<br>
<p>About the asteroids, as they are mined they can be refit to monoliths.
<br>
Then, they can be spun to gravity, which is a reliable gravity
<br>
simulation mechanism, probably, and sown with Earth life.
<br>
<p>One thing to consider is that we could engineer anaerobic space-hardy
<br>
mutations of Earth life.  Engineering it is the difference between
<br>
allowing it to happen without intercession and not.  Technology offers
<br>
many opportunities.
