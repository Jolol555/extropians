<p>'Lost' asteroid could hit Earth
<br>
<p>by Geraint Smith, Science Correspondent
<br>
At least one potentially dangerous asteroid is being discovered every night 
<br>
and the rate is increasing rapidly.
<br>
<p>More than 300 asteroids with orbits that cross Earth's were found last year, 
<br>
and this year the discoveries are coming faster, Dr Duncan Steel of the 
<br>
University of Salford will tell the National Astronomy Meeting in Cambridge 
<br>
later this week.
<br>
<p>However, even more worrying may be one that has gone missing.
<br>
<p>&quot;One, in particular, we need to find. It was seen for only 10 days in 1998, 
<br>
and it looked as though it might be on a potential collision course within 
<br>
the next 30 years.
<br>
<p>&quot;However, it was not seen for long enough to calculate the orbit to know for 
<br>
certain.&quot;
<br>
<p>The object, known as 1998 OX 4, is about half a mile across, he said. &quot;If it 
<br>
hit San Francisco, California would cease to exist. If it hit London, much 
<br>
of England would cease to exist.&quot;
<br>
<p>The object that killed the dinosaurs was between five and 10 miles in size, 
<br>
but just 93 years ago an asteroid only 60 or 70 yards across blew up in the 
<br>
atmosphere above Siberia, producing a blast which, had it had Marble Arch as 
<br>
its centre, would have flattened all of London out to the M25.
<br>
<p>&quot;The chance of that occurring is small, but the consequences are so 
<br>
phenomenal that it is a hazard we must take seriously,&quot; Dr Steel said.
<br>
<p>Dr Steel is one of six foreign scientists on Nasa's Spaceguard Committee, 
<br>
which made recommendations to the US Congress on how to deal with &quot;Near 
<br>
Earth Objects&quot;.
