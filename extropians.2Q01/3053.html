<p><p>Legendary Pink Dots is goth in the soft, depressing, romantic sense - rather
<br>
than the harsher counterparts also considered goth.  Extropian memes can be
<br>
found in some of their work as well.

Goth!!!!! It can't be true - how embarrassing.
<br>
Can anyone suggest something appropriate by way of genre?
<br>
<p>[Martin]
<br>
I wouldn't personally put The Land Canaan in the &quot;goth&quot; cathegory right
<br>
away as it only bears some resemblance (male vocals, the strings and
<br>
some of the melody style) to what characterizes goth music in my
<br>
opinion. However, both the music and the song is very much what would
<br>
in most countries be filed under &quot;goth&quot; or &quot;darkwave&quot;. It's quite close
<br>
to bands such as Soil &amp; Eclipse and Dronning Maud Land, and I find
<br>
myself thinking of Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. ;)
<br>
<p>The resemblance to Soil and Eclipse is quite striking anyway. I prefer
<br>
your lyrics, the voices are about as good but Soil &amp; Eclipse is a
<br>
little bit better musically, at least their more recent releases. Not
<br>
to say your music is bad at all. On the contrary, I really like it.
<br>
<p>Goth music isn't all about darkness, vampires and death, which is the
<br>
thing which is appalling to a lot of people. If you listen to any of
<br>
the bands that are hailed as the &quot;founders&quot; of gothic music such as The
<br>
Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Alien Sex Fiend and
<br>
Bauhaus, you will find that most of their lyrics are about other
<br>
things. I could post a lot of examples of intelligent, imaginative or
<br>
rather stupid lyrics far from the &quot;doom and darkness&quot; that is Cradle of
<br>
Filth and Marilyn Manson (I'm not saying anything about whether these
<br>
bands are good or bad, mind you. Just that they are quite different and
<br>
very not-goth) but if someone on this list is interested in that, the
<br>
lyrics aren't hard to find.
<br>
<p>I personally believe that much of the flirting with death in gothic
<br>
music is done more as a means to overcome the fear of death and all the
<br>
drama surrounding it, rather than trying to scare little children (or
<br>
their parents). There's no reason reason for letting death dominate
<br>
your life. I think music that makes fun of death and dying partly
<br>
functions much in the same way as festivals of death at various places
<br>
in the world. This is my opinion and not something I call a fact.
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't worry, we're all going to die. Let's have some fun meanwhile.&quot;
<br>
Or in some cases: &quot;Don't worry about dying, do something about it
<br>
instead.&quot; Am i rambling now? Yes. This has nothing to do with whether
<br>
The Land Canaan is goth or not, but is however an interesting subject.
<br>
<p>Anyway, &quot;gothic&quot; (or &quot;alternative&quot;, which doesn't really mean much
<br>
these days) would probably be what most people'd call your music, but
<br>
you could always call it &quot;neo-ambient&quot; or something. It is tradition
<br>
for bands labeled as &quot;goth&quot; to say &quot;we're not goth!&quot;. ;) But don't
<br>
despair. I label my own band Kallisti &quot;experimental rock&quot; and everyone
<br>
else says &quot;oh, your goth band&quot;. ;P
<br>
<p>Personally, if I'd write a review of The Land Canaan, I'd say that it's
<br>
musically mostly &quot;slow, dark electronics&quot;, vocally &quot;musical&quot; and leave
<br>
the classification at that. Genres aren't the most important thing in
<br>
the world. I'd concentrate on whether it was good or not, and on the
<br>
content of the lyrics.
