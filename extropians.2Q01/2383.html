</em><br>
<p>Err, just how many of us *are* scientific researchers?  I can count
<br>
myself, as an amateur anyway (with very limited, but not completely
<br>
zero, effect on the world thus far).  But seeing the future does not
<br>
require an ability to do anything about it; indeed, a common fallacy of
<br>
people in positions of power seems to be an inability to look far down
<br>
the road (since they've invested too much effort in getting into power
<br>
to develop their future sight).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    I subscribed to this list because I care about the future and I knew that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there *would* be people on it that have access and can get word to alot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that I can't.    But I have to point out the negatives involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, because every Extropian site I've been to, to me, sees the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with rather rose-tinted glasses.
</em><br>
<p>Out of necessity, and pragmatism.  There are many who will point out
<br>
tons of problems with any technology; we (and our few allies) are often
<br>
the only ones willing to speak in favor of, or even seriously consider,
<br>
those improvements we want.  If everybody but us is convinced that
<br>
genetic engineering is a horrible idea, who can prove (not convince,
<br>
but *prove*) them wrong by doing it and showing that all the predicted
<br>
terrors utterly fail to appear?  Likewise, if most people are convinced
<br>
that technology X is a generic bad scary nasty evil bogeyman, who but
<br>
us can at least spark a rational debate on the dangers of technology X,
<br>
with an eye towards solving the problems so everyone can reap the
<br>
benefits?  (That came across in this discussion: you seemed to be
<br>
saying that neural enhancement, like in Shadowrun, is a bogeyman since
<br>
it has certain dangers, and the reply was an attempt to discuss how to
<br>
solve those problems.  We can discuss internally, but sparking a
<br>
discussion in the world at large needs resources we do not have to
<br>
spare - but which you might.)
<br>
<p>Fear is easier to spread than hope.  It is for that reason that we,
<br>
the hopeful, are always outnumbered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    That and since some of you are actually robotics and neurbiology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers rather than just avid sci-fi fans like me,  I figure that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys will be able to deal with the specifics of things, rather than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general concepts, which is about all I can do.
</em><br>
<p>I don't suppose there's anybody working on, say, a fusion reactor or
<br>
somesuch who could help me with a few questions I have on generating
<br>
and handling plasma?  Everyone I've tried to ask clams up when I answer
<br>
their queries as to why I'm asking, so I've been forced to self-educate
<br>
to satisfy my curoisity.  I *think* I know enough to build a small one,
<br>
but I am well aware of the application of, &quot;A little knowledge is a
<br>
dangerous thing.&quot;
