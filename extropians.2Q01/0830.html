<em>&gt; Just a thought regarding Extro5 -- given the recent discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding simulations and ancestor recreations -- should there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be an after-hours video recording session where people spill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their guts to allow the recreation of more accurate simulations?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I suppose a complete simulation requires accurate replication of the
<br>
enteric nervous system -- &quot;the second brain&quot; as some people refer to it.
<br>
Uploading the memory of gut feelings probably offers no greater challenge
<br>
than that of uploading the rest of the CNS. For those too squeamish to
<br>
undergo this operation while awake, remember that &quot;anaesthetic offenses
<br>
numb the best defenses.&quot; So, those who don't want to spill their guts
<br>
verbatim may opt to delete particularly embarrassing or painful episodes
<br>
such as their gut feelings during particularly bad LSD trips, for
<br>
instance. Moreover, such a simulation may consume more bandwidth than it
<br>
deserves in pure (or first principle) extropy. By that I mean this
<br>
exercise may tend more toward extropy than entropy, but only by a narrow
<br>
margin.
