<em>&gt;(Robin, could you make a Web version?)
</em><br>
<p>Thanks Curt!  Maybe we will make a web version after the next revision,
<br>
coming soon, once we integrate the current round of comments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree with the conclusion of the paper - that people form ideas for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personal benefit, not in search of truth.  ...
</em><br>
<p>This is of course easier to conclude about others than about yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think though, that the paper overlooks other limitations on human Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior, primarily limited computational ability.  I would say most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-Bayesian behavior you outline can be explained by human inability to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good Bayesian, as well as by the fact that  people aren't trying to be good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesians in the first place. ...
</em><br>
<p>The section on Bayesian-wannabes, and the longer paper that section summarizes,
<br>
are intended exactly to address this.  They talk about someone who would be
<br>
Bayesian if they could compute it, but can't so compute.  It also seems
<br>
irrational for such wannabes to disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;First, as I've said before, people aren't good Bayesians.  Being a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesian requires logical omniscience.  ...
</em><br>
<p>Btw, that is actually not quite true.  A famous paper by Garber long ago
<br>
showed how to be a Bayesian who is not logically omniscient.  But admittedly
<br>
even this sort of Bayesian requires heroic computational abilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Resolving disputes by commonizing prior is a cost-benefit negative.  Changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;priors is horrendously expensive, in the sense that all those mind-expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probability calculations must be redone.  At the same time there's no benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- one prior is as good as another.  ...
</em><br>
<p>The whole idea of being a truth-seeker is that you should be willing to pay
<br>
some cost for truth.  You must be willing to spend some effort trying to
<br>
overcome inherited biases.  It is not clear to me that such efforts must be
<br>
horrendously expensive, though I agree that they have some expense.
<br>
<p>A simple cheap strategy is to say &quot;Oh, I'm disagreeing with someone.  That
<br>
wouldn't happen if we were both truth-seekers, so unless I have reason to
<br>
think they are more likely to be irrational than me, I would move my opinion
<br>
in their direction.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The John and Mary example also assumes John and Mary can efficiently exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information.  This doesn't match human experience.  It's very hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communicate experience ...  John hasn't time to get all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mary's data, or vice versa.
</em><br>
<p>The whole point of the analysis is that all they need to exchange is their
<br>
summary opinions.   They do *not* need to exchange their detailed data.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sorry my comments are so negative.  I really liked the paper.  But, you know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I gain little from accepting your conclusions and a lot if I get to put out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something successful of my own ... :-)
</em><br>
<p>I think of your comments as constructive - thanks!
