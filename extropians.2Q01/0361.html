<p><em>&gt; (The understanding of this statement, as written, perhaps illustrates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree to which one understands the &quot;extropian&quot; direction.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were the director of your own &quot;Truman Show&quot;, would you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the writers writing endless non-variant of days singing &quot;Glory to God
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Witch World, or McCaffrey's Pern, or Tolkein's Middle Earth, Zelazney's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amber or Gallun's &quot;The Eden Cycle&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Singing Glory to God in the highest does not preclude a very active and
<br>
variable limitless life. The real song is no mere hymn of course nor is
<br>
any God I consider worth believing in much less continuously praising
<br>
much like most mass-religious notions.  The notions that in &quot;heaven&quot; one
<br>
would only sing hymns and nothing else would every happen and no
<br>
challenges would arise was a silly (and pretty horrible) parody.  Most
<br>
of these world's would be fun for a while.  More fun if I could
<br>
eventually leave each and move on.  Of course it might spoil the
<br>
realness if I new that I could do that at all times.  :-) 
<br>
<p>Actually I think it would be much more fun to do some stellar
<br>
engineering and create a few life-bearing solar systems and nudge them
<br>
into living evolutionary algorithms just to see what might pop up.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see my Reading List page if you don't connect with the references.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On my darker days, I realize the power of justice in the Universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I am clear that almost all of the believers in the various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faiths (Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Bhuddist, etc.) [that have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been irrevocably decomposed into dispersed atoms] *will* be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the endless reward they believe in...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The questions then become:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Have they fully anticipated the consequences of 'having it'?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Will they want it if they know they can have it?&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>Now that is a very, very good question.    The implications of having it
<br>
is that they become quite different from who they thought they would be
<br>
in the having and the being with it.  
<br>
<p>Seek and do not fine is a time-honored human neurosis.  Finding implies
<br>
great change and re-assessment.  Not finding lets you pine away for that
<br>
which you seek.
