</em><br>
<p>Yes. But how is that different from cellular phones? Should cellular
<br>
phones be regarded as a transhumanizing technology? My answer would
<br>
actually be yes, cellphones change (albeit slightly) what it means to be
<br>
a human, degeographizing us in an interesting way just as datajacks
<br>
would dissolve the interface between man and machine.  However, as you
<br>
say the reasons people get this technology in are petty and fairly
<br>
practical. Few people get them as a way of enhancing themselves beyond
<br>
human.
<br>
<p>This is where I think SR does not do justice to the possible themes.
<br>
Instead of exploring the meaning of all these enhancements, how the
<br>
human condition is changed by the cyberware (and magic, in this case) it
<br>
mostly uses them as &quot;cool powers&quot;. Of course, this is good for the game,
<br>
which is after all about action rather than philosophy, but I enjoy
<br>
games that really asks these kind of questions in addition to the
<br>
action. The problem is of course that few games really do this; this is 
<br>
why I'm writing my own scenarios these days. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;   And even in the main book there are the important but often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neglected or ignored &quot;Skillwires&quot; which let a character plug a chip in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and they can access a skill from that chip, even if they don't actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know it. Kind of like borrowed memories, in a way.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is a technology that would have enormous effects if used
<br>
effectively. A trivial example would be for a corporation to license a
<br>
library of skills, downloading them to linked employees as needed - no
<br>
need for training and in an emergency everybody can become a fireman or
<br>
security guard instantly. Add some coordination through the net, and
<br>
the secretary pool becomes a formidable opponent for shadowrunners ;-)
