<p><p>Open the archives!  How the open source movement is changing historic
<br>
archives.
<br>
<p>By Joyce Slaton
<br>
<p>IN 1935 OTTO Bettmann
<br>
preserved an invaluable chunk
<br>
of history when he sneaked
<br>
two steamer trunks of photos
<br>
out of Nazi Germany. His
<br>
collection of photos kept
<br>
growing when he began a new
<br>
life in America, and
<br>
eventually it documented
<br>
events and objects as
<br>
disparate as World War II
<br>
battlefields, Rosa Parks on
<br>
the bus, and historical
<br>
medical tools. And Bettman's
<br>
collection expanded even
<br>
after his death. In 2001 the
<br>
Bettman Archive contained an
<br>
estimated 17 million images,
<br>
some of them quite famous -
<br>
the photo of JFK Jr. saluting
<br>
his father's coffin, for
<br>
instance.  But even without
<br>
the most famous photos, this
<br>
collection is unarguably a
<br>
treasure of visual
<br>
documentation from the 20th
<br>
century.
<br>
<p>So what did the Bettmann
<br>
Archive do with this
<br>
invaluable chunk of human
<br>
history? Why, it sold it to
<br>
Bill Gates, of course.
<br>
<p>Corbis, the Bill Gates-owned
<br>
company that bought the
<br>
archives in 1995, will keep
<br>
almost anyone from ever
<br>
seeing them again. The
<br>
millions of images in the
<br>
archive are scheduled to be
<br>
sunk 220 feet down in a
<br>
Pennsylvania limestone
<br>
mine. They'll be placed into
<br>
subzero humidity-controlled
<br>
storage, safe forever from
<br>
both human and natural
<br>
disasters. And, by the way,
<br>
they'll also be &quot;safe&quot; from
<br>
anyone who might ever want to
<br>
look at, study, or reprint
<br>
the images.
<br>
<p>Is Bettmann preserving part
<br>
of our history or locking it
<br>
up and throwing away the key?
<br>
Many critical archivists
<br>
claim the latter. They assert
<br>
that archivists must always
<br>
strike a difficult balance
<br>
between the twin duties of
<br>
their trade, preserving the
<br>
annals of history and somehow
<br>
providing public access to
<br>
those annals without damaging
<br>
them. By locking up millions
<br>
of images far away from human
<br>
hands and eyes, Bettmann may
<br>
have leaned tragically far
<br>
toward preservation without
<br>
concern for access.
<br>
<p>A new generation of &quot;open
<br>
source&quot; archivists are
<br>
arguing that archiving needs
<br>
to change radically. Archives
<br>
shouldn't be sunk into mines,
<br>
and they probably shouldn't
<br>
be owned by large
<br>
corporations. A growing
<br>
number of these new-school
<br>
archivists, like San
<br>
Francisco's Rick Prelinger,
<br>
are creating publicly
<br>
available, free-for-all
<br>
archives on the Internet that
<br>
offer new answers to the
<br>
question of what to do with
<br>
the billions of pieces of
<br>
historical material rotting
<br>
away in libraries,
<br>
foundations, and university
<br>
archives all over the world.
<br>
<p>Digitizing the bastard genre
<br>
films
<br>
<p>Rick Prelinger wants to know
<br>
which of the more than 1,000
<br>
digitized films in his
<br>
archive I'd like to see.
<br>
<p>&quot;Let's see here: 'Cheating,'
<br>
'Cheerios,' 'The Chicken of
<br>
Tomorrow,' &quot; he lists. &quot;Oooh,
<br>
you've got to see 'Coffee
<br>
House Rendezvous' - that was
<br>
sponsored by the Coffee
<br>
Institute, and it was shown
<br>
to churches and youth
<br>
organizations to inspire them
<br>
to create coffeehouses for
<br>
the disaffected youth. And
<br>
here, 'Death to Weeds' - that
<br>
was made by Dow Chemical in
<br>
1946 to show off that miracle
<br>
new pesticide, DDT.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's probably obvious that
<br>
the films in the Prelinger
<br>
collection aren't exactly
<br>
your big-screen Hollywood
<br>
pictures. Prelinger has a
<br>
fascination with what he
<br>
calls the &quot;bastard genres,&quot;
<br>
the thousands of promotional,
<br>
educational, and industrial
<br>
films created to whip up
<br>
consumer frenzies, educate
<br>
the school kiddies, and train
<br>
employees to flog company
<br>
products more properly.
<br>
<p>Fascinated with these lost
<br>
gems, Prelinger has spent the
<br>
last 20 years locating,
<br>
obtaining, and preserving
<br>
whatever films he could get
<br>
his hands on, buying out
<br>
preprint materials from
<br>
out-of-business production
<br>
companies and old reels from
<br>
school districts and, in at
<br>
least one notable case,
<br>
liberating a substantial
<br>
number of films from the
<br>
storage closet of a retired
<br>
film director in Fort Wayne,
<br>
Ind.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are so many of these
<br>
things out there, and many of
<br>
them were made with high
<br>
production values, yet no one
<br>
ever sees them,&quot; Prelinger
<br>
says. &quot;On one hand they're
<br>
hilarious, yet on the other
<br>
they're an incredible
<br>
documentary of both the way
<br>
things really were as well as
<br>
our ideas about the way
<br>
things were supposed to be.&quot;
<br>
<p>Case in point: The splendid
<br>
&quot;Once upon a Honeymoon,&quot; a
<br>
1956 AT&amp;T film in which an
<br>
enraptured wife sings about
<br>
the wonders of color
<br>
telephones. &quot;It's nice to
<br>
have a telephone / To blend
<br>
with my new drapes and home,&quot;
<br>
the housewife trills,
<br>
whirling beatifically around
<br>
her magically remodeled new
<br>
home in a fluffy pink
<br>
gown. Then there's the 1957
<br>
gem &quot;The Relaxed Wife,&quot; a
<br>
Pfizer-sponsored love letter
<br>
to the wonders of its Atarax
<br>
tranquilizer. &quot;Unless you
<br>
were at the Pfizer trade show
<br>
in 1957, you wouldn't get to
<br>
see 'The Relaxed Wife,' &quot;
<br>
Prelinger says.
<br>
<p>Until now, that is. Prelinger
<br>
is well on the way to meeting
<br>
his goal: putting digitized
<br>
copies of 1,000 - out of the
<br>
thousands of films in his
<br>
collection - online, free for
<br>
the public to access and
<br>
use. Anyone with the tech
<br>
equipment and savvy to visit
<br>
Prelinger's online archive
<br>
(housed at
<br>
www.archive.org/movies) can
<br>
download the movies, sample
<br>
them, use them for classroom
<br>
study, run them at theaters,
<br>
or even use the footage to
<br>
make a for-profit film.
<br>
<p>It's a rather shocking
<br>
contrast to the Bettman
<br>
Archive's approach to
<br>
preserving history, and it's
<br>
particularly surprising
<br>
considering Prelinger makes
<br>
his living selling footage
<br>
from the films to sources
<br>
such as Biography, VH1's
<br>
Behind the Music, and the now
<br>
defunct series Mystery
<br>
Science Theater
<br>
3000. However, Prelinger's
<br>
free-for-all Internet gambit
<br>
illustrates a possibility
<br>
never imagined by traditional
<br>
archivists: free access to
<br>
important historical archives
<br>
that doesn't wind up ruining
<br>
the collection.
<br>
<p>The archivists' conundrum
<br>
<p>Whether they work at museums,
<br>
national foundations,
<br>
libraries, or elsewhere,
<br>
traditional archivists have a
<br>
difficult gatekeeping
<br>
function. They have to make
<br>
sure the public doesn't
<br>
damage historical materials
<br>
by touching them,
<br>
photographing them, using
<br>
them, or whatever else might
<br>
be necessary to study them.
<br>
<p>&quot;Rare materials, particularly
<br>
older materials, are so
<br>
fragile,&quot; says David Rumsey,
<br>
and he should know: his
<br>
enthusiasm for maps and
<br>
mapmaking has led him to
<br>
collect about 150,000 rare
<br>
maps, atlases, surveys, and
<br>
other cartographic documents
<br>
in the course of more than
<br>
two decades. His documents,
<br>
mostly from 18th- and
<br>
19th-century America, are
<br>
fascinating relics that show
<br>
the limited understanding of
<br>
geography we had even just
<br>
300 years ago. He has a 1731
<br>
pocket globe that shows
<br>
California as an island.
<br>
<p>Rumsey understands that these
<br>
historical treasures are
<br>
better seen than read about -
<br>
but display carries with it
<br>
the danger of damage. &quot;When
<br>
you touch them with your
<br>
fingers, the oils in your
<br>
hand can damage the surface,
<br>
particularly with paper, and
<br>
exposing older materials,
<br>
photographs especially, to
<br>
light can be quite damaging,&quot;
<br>
Rumsey says.  Which is why he
<br>
has allowed only those with a
<br>
genuine historical interest
<br>
in pieces from his collection
<br>
to thumb through the
<br>
thousands of items stashed in
<br>
his San Francisco home.
<br>
<p>&quot;I did a lot of my learning
<br>
about maps by going to
<br>
libraries like the Bancroft
<br>
Library at Berkeley, where
<br>
I'd fill out a pink slip at
<br>
the reference desk, get my
<br>
two or three items at a time,
<br>
and go pore over them,&quot; he
<br>
says rapturously. &quot;And
<br>
getting the chance to view
<br>
the originals was so
<br>
wonderful - the smell of the
<br>
old paper, the decaying
<br>
varnish used on old wall
<br>
maps.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Rumsey understood that
<br>
just by bringing his maps
<br>
from their dusty storage spot
<br>
and exposing them to light
<br>
and touch, he was putting
<br>
them at risk. He couldn't
<br>
bear to see the pieces in his
<br>
own collection undergoing the
<br>
same risks.  So despite his
<br>
desire to share his
<br>
collection, he kept it mainly
<br>
under wraps while he worked
<br>
at finding a solution.
<br>
<p>Traditionally, archives have
<br>
handled the preservation
<br>
versus access conundrum in
<br>
one of two ways. The first is
<br>
the museum approach: visitors
<br>
are allowed to view
<br>
historical and artistic
<br>
documents and objects, but
<br>
the objects themselves are
<br>
kept under glass or behind
<br>
velvet ropes, restricting the
<br>
sensual, almost mystical
<br>
experience of actually
<br>
touching an object. However,
<br>
as many museums have found,
<br>
providing a space for
<br>
visitors to view their
<br>
collections is prohibitively
<br>
expensive: items must be
<br>
specially preserved and
<br>
displayed, staff must be
<br>
hired to watch over them,
<br>
space must be bought or
<br>
rented and maintained.
<br>
<p>The second, cheaper approach
<br>
is the reference library
<br>
model championed by most
<br>
archivists and typically
<br>
found at universities and
<br>
libraries. In this model,
<br>
such archives are kept
<br>
carefully away from public
<br>
eyes and hands. Often, those
<br>
who wish to view the
<br>
materials must have some
<br>
sanctioned scholarly reason
<br>
for doing so; mere curious
<br>
looky-loos are discouraged,
<br>
no matter how sincere they
<br>
might be. And even those
<br>
archives that let practically
<br>
anyone view their contents
<br>
often insist that visitors
<br>
make viewing appointments,
<br>
arrive during certain hours,
<br>
fill out lengthy forms
<br>
requesting access, and view
<br>
only a few objects or
<br>
documents at a time.
<br>
<p>It's no wonder Prelinger
<br>
terms this kind of access
<br>
&quot;needlessly restrictive.&quot; To
<br>
complicate matters still
<br>
further, archives typically
<br>
don't advertise their
<br>
presence. Though Berkeley's
<br>
Bancroft Library actually
<br>
provides fairly liberal
<br>
access to its collections,
<br>
the average person would have
<br>
no idea of the treasures
<br>
contained in the Bancroft
<br>
Library, which include, for
<br>
example, Alameda land records
<br>
during the period of 1836
<br>
through 1931, Mark Twain's
<br>
private papers, original
<br>
materials from the
<br>
Haight-Ashbury district
<br>
during the 1960s, and more
<br>
than three million historical
<br>
photographs of California and
<br>
the West.
<br>
<p>&quot;Pieces of our collective
<br>
history are rotting away in
<br>
museums and libraries and
<br>
universities with very few
<br>
people seeing them or even
<br>
knowing they exist,&quot;
<br>
Prelinger says.  &quot;Archivists
<br>
are caught between wanting
<br>
members of the public to see,
<br>
appreciate, and learn from
<br>
the amazing artifacts in
<br>
their collection and worrying
<br>
that giving them that access
<br>
will ruin the collection and
<br>
piss off the foundations that
<br>
support their existence.&quot;
<br>
<p>But, as Prelinger, Rumsey,
<br>
and others have learned,
<br>
there is a middle ground, and
<br>
it can be found online.
<br>
<p>Look Ma, no hands!
<br>
<p>Before the Internet,
<br>
archivists had no truly
<br>
effective way of displaying
<br>
their wares. Even creating
<br>
museum space fails in certain
<br>
respects: people who wish to
<br>
view collections still have
<br>
to travel to visit the
<br>
museum's real-world space.
<br>
<p>One of the World Wide Web's
<br>
greatest powers is as a
<br>
distribution
<br>
network. Prelinger has
<br>
created a single online
<br>
archive of his films,
<br>
admittedly at great expense
<br>
and effort, that can be
<br>
accessed by virtually
<br>
anybody, anywhere, at any
<br>
time. A person in Angola can
<br>
download &quot;A Is for Atom&quot; and
<br>
use excerpts for a television
<br>
show, while at the same time
<br>
a Midwestern school kid is
<br>
viewing a copy of footage
<br>
from the 1939 New York
<br>
World's Fair for a class
<br>
project.  And neither of
<br>
these uses will hamper future
<br>
visitors from using the
<br>
collection.
<br>
<p>&quot;The key is making
<br>
collections digital,&quot; says
<br>
Brewster Kahle, the archivist
<br>
visionary behind the Internet
<br>
Archive
<br>
(www.archive.org). His
<br>
archive's purpose is to
<br>
preserve and provide access
<br>
to copies of just about every
<br>
site on the Internet, from
<br>
the time the archive was
<br>
launched in 1996, right up
<br>
through all the pages yet to
<br>
be launched in the future. So
<br>
far the archive has collected
<br>
more than 40 terabytes of
<br>
material. To put that in
<br>
context, if you saved all the
<br>
text of all the books in the
<br>
Library of Congress in ASCII
<br>
(or text) form, it would take
<br>
up about 20 terabytes.
<br>
<p>&quot;In a digital age civic
<br>
institutions no longer have
<br>
to choose between
<br>
preservation and access,&quot;
<br>
Kahle says. &quot;You can provide
<br>
free access that doesn't
<br>
damage materials.&quot;
<br>
<p>Creating a digital collection
<br>
<p>Viewing a digital copy
<br>
doesn't degrade the original,
<br>
and that's part of the reason
<br>
why so many archives are
<br>
jumping on the digital
<br>
bandwagon. Yale, New York's
<br>
Museum of Modern Art,
<br>
Cornell, Stanford, the New
<br>
York Public Library, and
<br>
other entities are each in
<br>
various stages of projects
<br>
intended to present pieces
<br>
from these institutions'
<br>
substantial historical
<br>
archives online.
<br>
<p>But making digital copies
<br>
doesn't come cheap, nor is it
<br>
easy.  In fact, turning
<br>
actual objects into digital
<br>
representations is a
<br>
laborious procedure that
<br>
often must be done by hand
<br>
and at great expense. The
<br>
Internet Archive, which
<br>
funded the digital
<br>
transformation of the
<br>
Prelinger Archives and
<br>
provides the online space for
<br>
them, has spent about
<br>
$200,000 to turn reels of
<br>
film into compressed .avi and
<br>
.mpg files. Rumsey, the map
<br>
collector, has spent more
<br>
than two years and thousands
<br>
of dollars building a
<br>
customized computer
<br>
workstation and carefully
<br>
scanning thousands of paper
<br>
maps into the digital
<br>
archives, freely available at
<br>
www.davidrumsey.com.
<br>
<p>Even when materials arrive in
<br>
digital form, cataloging,
<br>
organizing, and maintaining
<br>
files is tremendously
<br>
time-intensive. Just ask Rita
<br>
Rouvalis, who maintains the
<br>
Etext Archives
<br>
(www.etext.org), a collection
<br>
of tens of thousands of
<br>
e-zines, political texts,
<br>
fictional works, and
<br>
religious texts. Founder Paul
<br>
Southworth began collecting
<br>
work in 1992, and ever since
<br>
he turned the archives over
<br>
to Rouvalis in 1993, she's
<br>
spent her free time archiving
<br>
and keeping the collection up
<br>
to date.
<br>
<p>Why does she spend her time
<br>
on a task that's unpaid and
<br>
often thankless? Quite
<br>
simply, she sees herself as a
<br>
historian. &quot;Rants and zines
<br>
and other independent
<br>
literature tend to
<br>
disappear,&quot; Rouvalis
<br>
says. &quot;It's out there for a
<br>
month piled in a bookstore or
<br>
handed out at a reading, and
<br>
then it's just gone. We
<br>
wanted to create something
<br>
permanent.&quot;
<br>
<p>But electronic archiving
<br>
remains expensive,
<br>
time-consuming, and not
<br>
without its legal dangers.
<br>
Archivists who keep material
<br>
in dusty old files in
<br>
university basements don't
<br>
need to worry about violating
<br>
copyright laws. But those who
<br>
publish online must have an
<br>
exquisite sensitivity to
<br>
those laws and be careful not
<br>
to reproduce anything not in
<br>
the public domain.
<br>
<p>Witness the cautionary tale
<br>
of Eric Eldred, the man so
<br>
enraptured by digitizing rare
<br>
books that he took on U.S.
<br>
copyright laws. His case,
<br>
Eldred v. Ashcroft, has
<br>
dragged on for more than two
<br>
years, eating up tremendous
<br>
resources as Eldred and
<br>
attorneys from Harvard's
<br>
Berkman Center continue to
<br>
seek changes in copyright
<br>
law. Meanwhile, Eldred
<br>
himself has developed
<br>
repetitive strain injuries
<br>
and doesn't do as much
<br>
electronic publishing these
<br>
days. He's still digitizing
<br>
rare books to distribute at
<br>
his Eldritch Press site,
<br>
though, which exposes him to
<br>
potential criminal penalties
<br>
of up to five years in
<br>
prison.
<br>
<p>&quot;Is this the reward you get
<br>
for thinking the Net could be
<br>
used for more than just
<br>
distributing porn?&quot; an
<br>
embittered Eldred asks.
<br>
<p>But despite these drawbacks,
<br>
digital archivists remain
<br>
committed to their defiantly
<br>
noncommercial task and
<br>
devoted to the notion of
<br>
making important historical
<br>
documents - or at least
<br>
digital copies of them -
<br>
available to all. To many, it
<br>
seems that only by putting
<br>
materials online can
<br>
archivists attend to their
<br>
dual duties, both preserving
<br>
originals and allowing free
<br>
access to their digital
<br>
copies.  Seeing these
<br>
reproductions may not be
<br>
quite as fascinating as
<br>
touching and holding the
<br>
original historical objects,
<br>
but it seems like the best
<br>
possible solution right now,
<br>
and it's one getting more
<br>
popular every day.
<br>
<p>&quot;The last time somebody tried
<br>
to collect all the text in
<br>
the world was the Library of
<br>
Alexandria, and that burned
<br>
down,&quot; Kahle says. &quot;We're
<br>
building a memory of cultural
<br>
artifacts, and we're
<br>
preserving the material in a
<br>
way in which it can't
<br>
degrade, can't be lost, and
<br>
can be viewed by anyone with
<br>
Net access. With this memory,
<br>
with this documentation,
<br>
we're assuring ourselves that
<br>
revisionist historians can't
<br>
control the past, that no one
<br>
can control our memory of the
<br>
past, because it's right here
<br>
for anyone to see.&quot;
