<p><em>&gt;A couple of quick points...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- No one is talking about letting people go free, as you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mentioned above... a life sentence is a bloody awful prospect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- There is no reason in my mind to trust the justice system (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your country or mine) to decide when a person should be killed..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there seem to be too many cockups. Life imprisonment is a fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compromise, because when it turns out that a person was innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after all, they are (usually) not already dead.
</em><br>
<p>I for one do not find life imprisionment to be a fair compromise,
<br>
however we agree on the second point, the death penalty should only
<br>
be applied where we are sure &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- Also, disturbingly, there seem to be a lot of political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machinations around whether people are executed or not, in the US;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thumbs up or thumbs down seems to be related to the predicted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect on the governors PR, and subsequent likelihood of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reelected. If you are going to do that, then make the convicted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fight savage beasts in an arena for the pleasure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crowds... be honest about what the real purpose of the sentence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is.
</em><br>
<p>The upcoming Tim McVeigh execution a case in point. (not that he
<br>
doesn't deserve it)
<br>
<p>I agree that we should be honest about it, &quot;you have deprived
<br>
someone of their life without just cause, and now we are going to
<br>
deprive you of yours as punishment&quot;. Period.
<br>
<p>The death penalty has an unexpected plus here in the U.S. as well,
<br>
criminals often sign confessions in plea bargainings to avoid the
<br>
death penalty.
<br>
<p>Obviously they consider life imprisionment not such a bad
<br>
alternative.
