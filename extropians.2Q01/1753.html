<p>You need to have a person at the other end to do interpersonal trust. 
<br>
<p>Or do you mean I should trust my local pastor about the reality of this
<br>
unobservable and just possibly non-existent person?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To the fideist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rationalist looks inconsistent because asserting the supremacy of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason can itself only be a matter of trust. 
</em><br>
<p>A matter of trust in exactly the same consistencies of the world that
<br>
underwrite almost all of the fideist's own verities.
<br>
<p>A matter of trust employing the same limits to credulity that the fideist
<br>
sets in all matters aside from this extraordinary and improbable claim for
<br>
the reality of an invisible person who never responds in a publicly
<br>
testable fashion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Could we build a God III that

</em><br>
<p>We could not *build* a God III--can't make head or tail of these
<br>
blueprints, Joe--but we might be able to kickstart something headed in such
<br>
a direction. If it emerged out the far end of the pipeline, could we trust
<br>
it? Well, we'd need to see what it did; by its fruits we shall know it. If
<br>
it was horrid to us, we'd be silly to trust it. `This hurts me more than it
<br>
hurts you' is the dictum of someone without much imagination or patience.
