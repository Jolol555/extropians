My understanding was that Mike had planned to travel across the United States and even eventually visit Alaska.  And so I assume he is doing that now.  But, I would think he would occasionally check his email at various internet cafes if he did not have a wireless connection.  I hope he is alright!

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I have been trying to get ahold of Michael Lorrey for a couple of weeks now 
&gt;and have not been able to do so.  I know that he has not unsubscribed from 
&gt;the extropians list, as I process all such requests; however, he has not 
&gt;posted anything since April 24th.  For most list members, this wouldn't be 
&gt;completely abnormal, but for Mike Lorrey in particular, it is very 
&gt;unusual...particularly since he gave no notice of his &quot;leave of abscence.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;If anyone knows Mike personally or otherwise knows the whereabouts of his 
&gt;person, please let me know as soon as you can.
&gt;
&gt;						Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;							-E. Shaun Russell
