I was struck by the irony of running such a show on a major holiday in the 
<br>
Christian superstition. Perhaps this is ABC's way of telling us what its 
<br>
management thinks of the folk beliefs in this country.

<p>Mark,
<br>
<p>I think you are reading too much into this.  I just got out of Easter services at my church so I felt like responding.  
<br>
<p>I regret having missed the program.  My devout Mormon mother called me up and told me about it very excitedly.  I will have to look for a transcript.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>P.S.  I enjoyed your responses to Mike Lorrey about human sexual strategies.  I thought you were very classy about it.
