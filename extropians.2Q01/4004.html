<em>&gt; &gt; Professor Warwick again.... He accepts that AI is coming, but doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think humans will survive it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I passed a billboard in Times Square this evening as I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heading for the Port Authority Bus Terminal that made me think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of AIs taking over the world. It was an ad for one of those nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;reality TV&quot; shows, all in red, with a woman in spectacles who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looks something like that no-nonsense chief resident character
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on _ER_ played by Laura Innes. The white lettering at the top
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said &quot;YOU ARE THE WEAKEST LINK&quot;, and at the bottom, &quot;GOODBYE&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>She's Ann Robinson, British TV personality (Nice comparison BTW!).  It's a 
<br>
very popular gameshow in the U.K., where Robinson displays her now 
<br>
trademark cutting (and at times bordering on cruel:) criticism of 
<br>
contestants who are doing badly.  It's now gone stateside, where it's doing 
<br>
a storm in the ratings apparently.
<br>
<p>The basic premise is that a group of people answer rounds of questions, at 
<br>
the end of each round voting out of the game the individual who did 
<br>
worst.  Then the &quot;Weakest Link&quot; line comes in, and they are expelled from 
<br>
the game.
<br>
<p>They were going to try find an American presenter, but there were none with 
<br>
her, ahem, character disposition:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It had a sort of _1984_-ish look, and the woman would be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choice for a &quot;Ms.&quot; O'Brien.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I thought it was even more menacing than &quot;All your base are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;belong to us.&quot; ;-&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jim F.
</em><br>
<p>She sure is.  She did a consumer affairs programme for several years called 
<br>
&quot;Watchdog&quot;, and took no nonsense there either.
<br>
<p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
