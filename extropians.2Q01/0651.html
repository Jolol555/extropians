<p>&lt;&lt; Well as the famous quote by some visionary goes, if a group of
<br>
&nbsp;distinguised scientists say something isn't going to ever occur,
<br>
&nbsp;bet on it happening....

Good quote, but it sounds more like one of Arthur C. Clarke's observations.  
<br>
I would say that there are discrepancies in which researchers decide 
<br>
something will occur and something will take a vastly, longer, time. Most of 
<br>
the predictions of groups like the Hudson Institute, the Rand Corporation, 
<br>
and the World Future Society tended to have greatly overestimated our 
<br>
technological prowess in all areas, save one, digital computing and 
<br>
telecommunication, which may be taken together as a single development.  Why 
<br>
this is, I have no idea, perhaps if a technologist did, he or she would sweep 
<br>
past these invisible, intellectual bottlenecks. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;My guess, also, is that if a simulation would be viable, the computer 
<br>
network one would be downloaded into would have to contain the digital analog 
<br>
of our entire nervous system.  So our medulla oblongata, spinal cord, 
<br>
Cerebrum,cerebellum, skin neural surface, etc, would all need their digital 
<br>
analogs. Secondly, do we know enough about the electron patterns and they 
<br>
jump around inside the brain, as well as the rest of the neurological system, 
<br>
we call ourselves? 
<br>
<p>Are there electron patterns as such or is more of a chemical system, in which 
<br>
case the chemical constructs would require a digital analog, somehow 
<br>
downloaded in a computer network. If its just a copy and the original you is 
<br>
dies in the process, (would we die or merely create a replica?) would it 
<br>
function as a decent replica of a individual, human, personality, or would it 
<br>
even fail to passa Turing test? Jeez and I thought my A+ Certification course 
<br>
was a bit challenging.
