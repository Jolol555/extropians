Forwarding the latest update from the World Transhumanist Association...
<br>
<p>WTA Update
<br>
27 February 2001
<br>
<p>Dear WTA member,
<br>
<p>The WTA continues its steady growth and is working quietly but (we hope) 
<br>
usefully to serve its mission (see below). Here are some updates on recent 
<br>
and upcoming developments:
<br>
<p>We have the fourth European transhumanist conference coming up this summer 
<br>
in Berlin, June 22-24. TransVision 2001 will be organized my the German 
<br>
group De:Trans. In addition to talks about various topics related to 
<br>
transhumanism, the organizers promise that there will be plenty of time for 
<br>
the informal get-togethers that have made the previous Transvisions so 
<br>
enjoyable. For more information, see the website 
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanismus.de/TV2001/berlin.html">http://www.transhumanismus.de/TV2001/berlin.html</a>. If you are interested in 
<br>
giving a presentation, you should submit an abstract by mid-March.
<br>
<p>The Extropy Insitute is gearing up for Extro5 this summer, probably to take 
<br>
place in San Jose, California, June 15-17. More details on this will soon 
<br>
be available on their website <a href="http://www.extropy.org">http://www.extropy.org</a>.
<br>
<p>Dr. Mark Walker has been appointed new editor-in-chief of the Journal of 
<br>
Transhumanism. Mark says he will aim especially to promote the JTH in the 
<br>
relevant academic communities. Although there have been many submissions in 
<br>
the last year, they have all failed the peer-review. Recently one paper has 
<br>
accepted, however, and will be published shortly.
<br>
<p>There are many new entries on the Local Groups page 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/groups.htm">http://www.transhumanism.com/groups.htm</a>) -- people who want to get in 
<br>
touch with other transhumanists in order to start organizations or 
<br>
discussion groups in areas where there currently are none. If you are 
<br>
interested, check out this page to see if there is somebody in your 
<br>
neighborhood.
<br>
<p>The World Transhumanist Association is, as you know, a volunteer network 
<br>
and we accomplish neither more nor less than what our members do. Our aims 
<br>
are to encourage research into transhumanism (the issues raised by 
<br>
anticipated future technologies, very broadly conceived), to promote 
<br>
informed media coverage and constructive debate, and to improve networking 
<br>
within the transhumanist community. If you want to take part, don't 
<br>
hesitate to suggest your own initiative. Anything from putting up a link to 
<br>
the WTA from your own website (or suggesting to relevant sites on the web 
<br>
that they do so) to volunteering to help out with running the WTA can be 
<br>
very valuable. In particular, we are now looking for one or two individuals 
<br>
who have the capability of taking independent initiatives to take on 
<br>
prominent roles in the WTA, for example as projects leader or membership 
<br>
officer. The scope of these positions would depend on the interests and 
<br>
skills of the interested person; a time commitment of maybe an hour or two 
<br>
a week would probably be sufficient. If you are interested, please do get 
<br>
in touch!
