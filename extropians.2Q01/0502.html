<em>&gt; Hmm...  Well, restricting one's definition of &quot;religion&quot; to the

</em><br>
<p>Here in the Vancouver Public Library there is a book called &quot;The New
<br>
Landscape&quot; by Chief Architect of New Bombay (Navi Mumbai) Charles Correa.
<br>
Correa depicts a &quot;mandala&quot; from Ancient India, a preliminary architectural
<br>
drawing for a new city, said to be divinely inspired. Apparently they
<br>
thought that faith (metaphysical) had a physical, in-this-world impact  
<br>
on public works. President Bush seems to think the same as he has called
<br>
for &quot;faith-based public works&quot; and even a &quot;culture of life&quot; (as has
<br>
Vatican). However, I don't think a lot of people suffering from religious
<br>
manias and delusions, people like the Grahams, Hagees, Van Impes etc. are
<br>
going to give Dubya what he wants. Maybe he should try the Hindus or
<br>
Buddhists of India.
