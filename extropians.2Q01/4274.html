<em>&gt; I read &quot;critical phase&quot; and it reminded me of two phenomena: phase

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps our concept of the Singularity could be said to represent a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phase transition in human affairs.  We could be moving from a solid to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a liquid, or a liquid to a gas.  The new state would be characterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by having many more degrees of freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Suppose we distinguish intelligent beings by their abilities to change
<br>
the world to suit their desires. There likely exists some upper limit to
<br>
the possible powers set by physical law. The simplest singularity
<br>
scenario could be seen as the transition from a newly evolved and fairly
<br>
powerless species that is driven by its own self-interest to acquire
<br>
power over the world to a species that has reached a high degree of
<br>
control. The transition is fairly quick because power to affect the
<br>
world can be used to gain more power (although the complications of
<br>
self-modification and what cultural drives are necessary/influential
<br>
remains to be studied), and this leads to a quick (in evolutionary
<br>
terms) transition.
<br>
<p>Maybe there exists several &quot;phases&quot; in the diagram. Suppose we have two
<br>
variables: power over the external world, and power over the form of the
<br>
species. The first limits the second to some extent, while the
<br>
autopotence of a species presumably could help it acquire more control.
<br>
Still, the classic fairly human but technologically advanced people of
<br>
much traditional sf could perhaps be seen as existing in a phase with
<br>
high external power but (possibly deliberately ignored) little
<br>
autopotence. The posthumans and SIs we discuss seem to exist in a phase
<br>
where autopotence has been dominant, leading to high degrees of internal
<br>
and external power. A purely protean species with limited external power
<br>
could be possible (and is another sf trope) but doesn't seem likely
<br>
since the ability to modify oneself is in the end limited by ones
<br>
ability to affect the world - we are after all subsets of it. 
<br>
<p>In this scheme, a species could undergo two separate singularities: one
<br>
autopotent and one external. For example, first nanotechnology and later
<br>
perhaps femtotech are rapidly developed, creating a situation where we
<br>
have great control over the world but limited abilities to modify our
<br>
own cognition or create AI. After some unspecified interval this is
<br>
achieved, and a second self-modifying singularity occurs. The reverse
<br>
scenario might also occur. I don't consider these divided scenarios very
<br>
likely, but we might be seeing sequences of singularities.
<br>
<p>In Orion's Arm we even played with the idea of a hierarchy of
<br>
singularity levels of intelligence, where the first singularity was
<br>
followed by new singularities at an ever increasing rate:

<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm trying to work the critical point into this imagery.  It is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point at which the distinction between water and gas becomes moot.  See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/phchem/deiters/persons/globass/critical.html">http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/phchem/deiters/persons/globass/critical.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This might represent a &quot;soft&quot; transition to a Singularity.  Rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a specific interface with people on one side or the other, we instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have gradual increases without any sharp, well-defined transition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until suddenly, to our surprise, we find ourselves having Transcended so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradually that we never noticed.  In the diagram above, we'd take a path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which circles around the critical point, the liquid-to-gas line endpoint,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something like the dotted arrows shown.  We'd go from one phase to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other without transition.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. It might be a very quick change which we doesn't notice anyway.
<br>
<p>I wonder about heats of transition? The change in entropy between
<br>
different phases release or absorb energy. Some transitions might
<br>
require the addition of significant amounts of work to occur, while
<br>
other might be self-driving.
