<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; To the apparently few actual Extropians (the capital &quot;E&quot; ones, you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; who you are) left on this list, may I suggest we spend the next few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; doing some serious schooling and &quot;education&quot; of the sizable crop of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newbies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; trolls, and gibbering incompetents who have made this list almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unusable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You know, not so very long ago (mere weeks, in fact), I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have taken a blast like this very much to heart myself, checking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This was not intended towards you or anyone else who makes relevant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actual-information-containing, interesting, etc. posts to this list.
</em><br>
<p>But what objective definition can we apply to &quot;relevant, 
<br>
actual-information-containing interesting&quot; posts?  I'd probably be dubious 
<br>
of most of my own posts here by my understanding of this.  Although I've 
<br>
been on the list for a reasonable while now , I still consider myself a 
<br>
&quot;newbie&quot; in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now I'm more inclined to shake my head at the crude attempt to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this sort of generalized guilt as a tool of intimidation, rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some more entertaining and enlightening form of social control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (argument, anyone? wit? humor?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately some people here if left to such &quot;light touch&quot; methods do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not respond; rather they take it as an opening to push the envelope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further and further. And they tend to end up drawing in other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with similar views. If left unchecked, this ends up turning the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list into mediocrity. So sorry if someone had to finally say something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;loud enough to hear, but if it cleans things up a bit then mission
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accomplished.
</em><br>
<p>Do we have specific examples of this happening?  Perhaps it's obvious to 
<br>
others on the list, but it evades me, thus far.  What am I missing (or 
<br>
doing wrong) here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have never, in fact, called myself either an extropian or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Extropian, and I think one of the great things about this list is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it's not necessary for me to do so in order to post here. If I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to sign something equivalent to the Thirty-Nine Articles in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; participate here, I'd be gone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Right-o. I have no problem with non-extropians posting here- what I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a problem with is people who come here simply to insult us, attack us in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a troll-like fashion (not interested in actual debate), or who simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have read so little of this list's past that they repeatedly rehash old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;old old issues while adding nothing new. I can't fully fault people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the last part since the list archives are hard to search currently.
</em><br>
<p>Why are we complaining about people coming here to insult extropians?  In 
<br>
an open forum like this, they'll always be around.  I'd have to say that 
<br>
compared to, for example, the forums over at the Secular Web (perhaps not a 
<br>
perfect comparison), we're pretty light on trolls here, and the ones we do 
<br>
get generally stick around to back up their posts.
<br>
<p>For the record, I'm one of the &quot;lightweights&quot; on this list.  I'm not 
<br>
involved in a scientific/research/engineering discipline, have only begun 
<br>
to scratch the surface of philosophy, know pretty much diddly squat 
<br>
regarding political, economic and social structuring/functioning, run for 
<br>
cover at even reasonably involved mathematics, have not read one quarter as 
<br>
much as I should on all these topics, and am likely guilty of many of the 
<br>
&quot;big paste, small response&quot; mails that seem to irk so much here.  I your 
<br>
average Joe, the typical layman (apart from being Transhumanist).  In all 
<br>
seriousness (and not sympathy seeking) are we attempting to determine some 
<br>
kind of &quot;cut off&quot; point for members here?
<br>
<p>I'd just like to know which of the &quot;newbies&quot;, &quot;trolls&quot;, or &quot;gibbering 
<br>
incompetents&quot; groups I'm (and perhaps some others who might be getting the 
<br>
same impression) are being fitted into.
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
