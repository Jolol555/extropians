</em><br>
<p>Hmm...if you could make the mass driver and power supply light enough
<br>
(a significant challenge, no doubt),
<br>
what about doing the reverse?  That is, fire your pellets away from
<br>
the direction you wish to go, fast enough and with enough drag that
<br>
they would vaporize before coming into contact with anything, and use
<br>
the recoil as lift.  Once in orbit, make sure you're firing them such
<br>
that they come out at much less than orbital velocity, and drop down
<br>
into the atmosphere (with same result).  Or, maybe let the pellets
<br>
vaporize from force of acceleration just before exiting the rail gun,
<br>
leaving only a trail of hot gas (just like chemical rockets).  You'd
<br>
have to have a cycle time of much more than one a second, of course,
<br>
but the fire time in the article suggests potentially millions per
<br>
second, if desired.
<br>
<p>Standard Idea Question: So, what obvious fallacy am I missing in the
<br>
above?  ^_^;
