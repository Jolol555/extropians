<p>Is it? I think we can both find plenty of examples of celebrations of 
<br>
mediocrity and genius, but which view is dominant? While there are strong 
<br>
ideological currents ignoring individuals in history, our culture still 
<br>
retains its obsession with the genius. I would say that public disapproval of 
<br>
the genius mostly comes from dissaproval of the imagined instability and 
<br>
amorality of the genius, but there is no public support for the mediocre just 
<br>
because they are mediocre, only in conjunction with other &quot;good&quot; traits like 
<br>
being an underdog or having a firm ethical foundation.

</em><br>
<p>Well, Einstein was certainly productive, but I wonder if he is really typical 
<br>
of the Mozarts. If we start looking at published papers, then the difference 
<br>
is usually smaller and partially caused by the Mozarts co-authoring with the 
<br>
Salieris a lot.

<p><em>&gt; In earlier eras it may have made emotional sense for people to try and be

</em><br>
<p>I agree. But as you know, my view is that we will not likely reach the 
<br>
Singularity through a lone genius working in a cellar - rather through the 
<br>
interwoven processes of a whole society moving for a variety of reasons 
<br>
Singularity-ward: led by the Mozarts, but powered by the uncountable 
<br>
Salieris.
