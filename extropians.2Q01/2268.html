<em>&gt;Thus, in the view of neurobiologist Walter Freeman...

<em>&gt;&quot;the brain [brings] the full weight of a lifetime's experience to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Consciousness is about bringing your entire history to bear on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your next step, your next breath, your next moment.&quot;  (p. 268).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A linguistic exchange between two such &quot;memory landscapes&quot; relies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for its power on the fact that the receiver can **recreate** a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conscious state similar (enough) to that of the sender, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than on the unlikely interpretation that the message somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encodes all the complexity of the conscious state of the sender:
</em><br>
<p>It is true that in intimate conversation where there is a true &quot;meeting of
<br>
the minds&quot;, you do end up imagining the mind you are speaking with.  But I
<br>
don't think this effect is as universal as is being presented here.  I can
<br>
think of a number of examples where no such presumption is necessary.
<br>
<p>One example would be relatively structured or formal interchange.
<br>
If you exchange simple greetings, there is no particular deep meaning
<br>
to look for.  Likewise if you are engaging in a structured question and
<br>
answer session, you don't necessarily have to construct a mental model
<br>
of the other person.  You're looking for information, and only the bare
<br>
minimum of experience necessary to resolve ambiguities is relevant.
<br>
<p>A larger example is animal consciousness.  Animals are not linguistic.
<br>
Do animals &quot;bring the full weight of a lifetime's experience to bear
<br>
on each moment as it is being lived?&quot;  I don't see that animal brains
<br>
are so different from humans that the answer can be different.  So if
<br>
it true for humans, it must be true for animals as well.  Yet some
<br>
animal babies are able to function very well immediately after birth.
<br>
Horse colts run with the herd within hours.  Evidentally they are able
<br>
to function very well with virtually no experience.
<br>
<p>To me this suggests a greater role for genetically determined structures
<br>
versus experiential ones.  We aren't really bringing our whole weight of
<br>
experience to bear on every moment, or rather, that is only the smallest
<br>
part of what we are bringing.  Rather, we are bringing the whole weight
<br>
of billions of years of evolution to that moment.  Our brain structures
<br>
determine what we experience.
<br>
<p>Messages, verbal communications, succeed not so much because we share
<br>
enough experiences with others that we can reconstruct their minds;
<br>
rather, they succeed because our brains are structured so as to be able
<br>
to elicit meaning from these communications.
<br>
<p>Now, what does this say about AI?  Not that AIs must be structured &quot;just
<br>
like us&quot; in order to be able to communicate with us.  It is plausible
<br>
that convergent evolution would produce brains by independent mechanisms
<br>
which can communicate.  And since we are designing AIs which can function
<br>
in human society, I don't think there is much danger that they will be
<br>
unable to communicate with us.
<br>
<p>Ultimately what is necessary for communication is a common language,
<br>
and common understanding about the world.  There is nothing surprising
<br>
about this; it is completely obvious.  We will never communicate with
<br>
AIs who don't understand the meaning of the words we use.  And to have
<br>
this understanding is to understand the world and the language.
<br>
<p>This was the insight which led to Lenat's CYC project.  It is an attempt
<br>
to teach a computer how the world works, in the hopes that this would
<br>
allow us to communicate with it.  So far, CYC appears to be a failure,
<br>
from what I have read.  This does not necessarily mean that the idea
<br>
is fundamentally wrong; rather, perhaps the mechanism being used is not
<br>
appropriate for representing the world.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, however we achieve AI, the machine will have to be able
<br>
to learn about the world.  This doesn't mean it must smell and taste
<br>
and dance; humans unfortunate enough to have been trapped in paralyzed
<br>
bodies have still developed full language skills.  This proves that it
<br>
is possible to learn enough about the world by being told, to understand
<br>
it and speak about it.  Something like this must be an element of any
<br>
AI teaching effort.
