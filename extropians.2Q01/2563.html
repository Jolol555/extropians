It appears as if &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Made%20in%20China&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104181010.MAA02409@color.sics.se&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>&gt; wrote:

|I was particularly struck by the passage where the author scorns the
<br>
|notion of racial equality:
<br>
|
<br>
|   Blacks do less well than whites and Asians in school, perform less
<br>
|   well on standardized tests, earn less, and are more prone to crime,
<br>
|   illegitimacy, and welfare dependency, so they must be as intelligent
<br>
|   and achievement-oriented as whites and Asians.
<br>

<br>
|I would not want to cast my lot with someone who holds such racist views.
<br>
<p>I find Michael Levin's point on reification well taken, though.
<br>
<p>As to the mumblage on ``race'', since there exists no well defined meaning
<br>
of the word, depending on how one defines it, one can imagine a group which
<br>
will prove one's point, whichever one wishes to prove.
<br>
<p>Generally speaking, there exists various differences between humans in
<br>
various imagined population groups. For example, humans part of some
<br>
immigrant groups have barely landed in their new country before they start a
<br>
thriving business, while humans part of some other group almost never do that.
<br>
This does not necessarily follow from genetic differences between the humans.
<br>
One can as easily explain the differences as differences in culture.
<br>
<p>Those who belong to a group in which the members share an idea X, then members
<br>
of that group will behave as if X holds more often than members of other
<br>
groups.
<br>
<p>Instantiate with e.g. any of
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;o	X=&quot;we must work hard or we are bad person&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o	X=&quot;we have always been victims of oppression&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;o	X=&quot;we cannot change our situation&quot;
<br>
<p>So the mumblage on ``race'' simply boils down to cultural values.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- - - -
<br>
<p>On a related issue, I find it interesting that most Americans use the
<br>
Negro/black/African-American/whatever term as an _inclusive_ term.
<br>
<p>Why define an offspring between a N/b/A-A/w human and a human from any
<br>
other ``race'' also as N/b/A-A/w?  Why not the other way around? Or why
<br>
not define subgroups if one finds ``race'' so relevant?  Simply a obsolete
<br>
remnant of the old U.S. race laws?
<br>
<p>Footnote: The old U.S. race laws defined a human as a Negro if at least
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/64 &quot;of Negro blood&quot;. (1/1 = Negro, 1/2 = mulatto, etc.)
