<p><p><p>April 23, 2070
<br>
<p>Aniston, Pitt Anonymized, Key Lost
<br>
<p>MALIBU--Spokespeople for celebrity activists Brad Pitt and Jennifer
<br>
Aniston
<br>
confirmed today that the longtime couple is currently anonymized and
<br>
that
<br>
the decryption keys have been lost or damaged.  &quot;Brad and Jennifer have
<br>
always enjoyed mixing with the public,&quot; explains a spokesperson for the
<br>
couple.  &quot;They're very down to earth that way.  They had just turned on
<br>
their anonymizers for a trip down to Pizza Bell to pick up some dinner.
<br>
When they went to turn them off, they found that something had gone
<br>
wrong.
<br>
They've both remained encrypted for the past couple of weeks or so. 
<br>
We're
<br>
hopeful that the technical people will be able to recover the keys in
<br>
due
<br>
course.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Pitt and Aniston both use recent versions of PGP-compliant anonymizing
<br>
hardware sold by Oakley under the GygesTM brand.  The Gyges system
<br>
includes
<br>
millions of self-replicating nanoMEMS that reside in the epidermis.  The
<br>
small machines each control a nanoscopic mirror.  Networked by low-power
<br>
RF
<br>
connections, the MEMS form a giant neural net dedicated to anonymizing
<br>
the
<br>
wearer through control of the mirrors.  Light striking the wearer is
<br>
re-directed in a seemingly random fashion, disguising the wearer's true
<br>
appearance.  Recent versions of Gyges have begun using distributed
<br>
65K-bit
<br>
encryption of the &quot;fa¡ade&quot; in order to thwart filter-enabled lenses and
<br>
glasses.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;We've gotten quite used to seeing anonymized patrons,&quot; notes Sally
<br>
Okibuchi, manager of Sony's New Fish Experience, a popular L.A.
<br>
celebrity
<br>
haunt.  &quot;It was disconcerting when they started to show up a few years
<br>
ago,
<br>
looking all blocky, like some kind of whistleblower or secret government
<br>
witness or something.  And those scrambled voices were a real hoot.  But
<br>
some of the newer anonymizers have a real sense of style, some of them
<br>
are
<br>
really beautiful.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;According to sources near the couple, Pitt and Aniston regularly used a
<br>
beta patch to Gyges that enables &quot;cross-keying,&quot; or the sharing of keys
<br>
between users and specially enabled HUD glasses through a proprietary
<br>
PKI.
<br>
Pitt and Aniston were known to use designer HUD glasses to enable them
<br>
to
<br>
see each other while they remained anonymized to the general public.
<br>
Experts who have examined the couple hypothesize that a bug in the patch
<br>
is
<br>
causing their anonymizers to export the dynamically generated keys to
<br>
the
<br>
associated HUD glasses while deleting the local copy of the key,
<br>
preventing
<br>
the systems from decrypting the couple.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;It's a real shame from our perspective,&quot; notes AOL Studio Chief
<br>
Marianne
<br>
Asse.  &quot;Two of our most bankable stars have just plummeted in value. 
<br>
Sure,
<br>
they can still see each other, but what about their obligations to us
<br>
and to
<br>
their public?  Their contracts specifically require key escrow.  They
<br>
should
<br>
have given us a copy of the key to hold in case of emergencies like
<br>
this.
<br>
They didn't, and that has put them in default.  According to contract,
<br>
that
<br>
grants us a right to use their likenesses digitally on stand-ins, and
<br>
that's
<br>
probably where we're headed.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;There's a good reason Jennifer and Brad didn't trust the studio with
<br>
their
<br>
keys,&quot; explains the couple's spokesperson.  &quot;They've had trouble in the
<br>
past
<br>
with the studio leaking the keys to contracted paparazzi and poaching
<br>
extra-contractual public appearances.  We're prepared to talk about
<br>
exactly
<br>
who has broken the contracts and when.  The default clause specifies
<br>
that
<br>
AOL gets the right to digital likenesses only if Brad and Jennifer are
<br>
substantially unable to perform their duties.  Sure, their bodies and
<br>
faces
<br>
are anonymized and won't show up right on camera, but their hair remains
<br>
perfectly shootable.  As long as they can shoot the hair, they've got
<br>
their
<br>
stars.  The studio can digitally add their own likenesses to them.  This
<br>
'stand-in' talk is just the studios trying to get out of paying the
<br>
stars,
<br>
and it's not right.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Though fans remain hopeful, encryption experts outside the Pitt-Aniston
<br>
camp doubt that the couple can be decrypted.  &quot;This is an example of bad
<br>
design and inadequate testing in a life-critical application,&quot; notes one
<br>
expert.  &quot;Getting them decrypted would require something like harnessing
<br>
the
<br>
quantum computational power of a body the size of the sun.  They're just
<br>
not
<br>
going to be cracked for centuries.&quot;
