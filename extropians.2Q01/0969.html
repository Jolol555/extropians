<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, let us be very clear about this.  Simulated beings are quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to require significantly greater resources than &quot;real&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't intend to imply anything about how difficult it is to
<br>
simulate beings.  Surely simulations can simulate even qualia.  All
<br>
I'm saying is a representation or a model is not the same is the real
<br>
thing and you must map the model back to the original to get the true
<br>
meaning from the model.  And this is especially true as far as
<br>
phenomenal qualities are concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we can say &quot;conscious knowledge&quot; is a short-term &quot;executing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuronal pattern.  If I go to sleep tonight, I will wake up tomorrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with &quot;mostly&quot; the same memories.  However my conscious thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern may think that everything my conscious thought pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tonight is thinking was completely wrong.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe your going of on another tangent here.  I think,
<br>
initially, we should focus on involuntary direct representations of
<br>
our primary senses, like sight and color.  Once we understand this,
<br>
then we'll have the tools to understand these much more complex kinds
<br>
of voluntary thought patterns, memories, love, security...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re: synathesia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case you have &quot;cross-wiring&quot; -- the experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are associated with &quot;red&quot; the red signal somehow get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with &quot;salt&quot; as well (or instead). 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely.  My point was, someone could alter a clone person
<br>
to use different qualia to represent reality.  They could use various
<br>
tastes to represent colors and visa versa.  Such a clone could be just
<br>
as intelligent, but surely his subjective experience would be
<br>
drastically different.  His effing of his representation of salt would
<br>
be different than what we use.  And this is what is important when
<br>
trying to understand what consciousness is, and what it is like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I myself would find it fascinating to put salt on my tongue, and be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wired into the other person's perceptions such that my memory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;red&quot; gets stimulated.  That is going to be the world we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entering with high-bandwidth mind-meld communications availability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its going to be very scary and very rewarding at the same time.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is there to be scared of?  I so much look forward to
<br>
wiring my brain to others so they can eff their sensations to me.  &quot;Oh
<br>
THATS what salt tastes like for you!?  It's very different for me.&quot;
<br>
some of us could conceivably say.  And it will be so rewarding to
<br>
expand our conscious spirit world with qualia none of us have ever
<br>
experienced before.  And enlarging our spirit world to contain much
<br>
more size and resolution....  It'll be so exciting to merge spirit
<br>
worlds and share spirit worlds....  Once we discover qualia and start
<br>
effing like all this the world will soon become very very different
<br>
than it is now, where we are all isolated and spiritually trapped
<br>
inside our own skulls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The experiences perceived by the brain are &quot;physical&quot; phenomena.  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that they cannot be quantified and communicated (if that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are suggesting) is to argue that there is some &quot;magic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afoot.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's science is entirely focused on cause and effect.  This
<br>
is because our senses are entirely cause and effect.  Our senses can
<br>
only abstractly model what they are sensing, hence we can not know
<br>
what reality out there is really like, other than the effect it has on
<br>
our senses.  Within such a limited scinece qualia re magic.  But they
<br>
are not any more magic than any other physical phenomenon.  There is
<br>
simply some physical stuff that is our brain that has phenomenal
<br>
qualities.  You can't discover these qualities through traditional
<br>
senses or any science based solely on them.  One must experience them
<br>
in their own consciousness, such that they can be compared and
<br>
contrasted to the qualia we already know, before one can know &quot;what
<br>
they are like&quot;...
