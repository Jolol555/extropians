<em>&gt; I get stuck on the &quot;therefore&quot;. The connection between look up tables

</em><br>
<p>While the brain has some lookup tables as has been discussed,
<br>
it doesn't seem (to me) to be 'conscious' if you remove all of
<br>
the active neural activity.  A lookup table (potentially with
<br>
the addition of some fuzzy logic to keep them from getting
<br>
astronomically huge) has no 'activity' other than the
<br>
retreival of a stream of bits from the table and running
<br>
them through the output device (this is what I'm calling
<br>
a zombie, though others may call this other things).
<br>
<p>My brain on the other hand, is conscious because I take
<br>
what is coming out of the lookup tables, an run a mini-sim
<br>
on the result of outputing that bit-stream.  I observe
<br>
whether that result is desirable and if that evaluation
<br>
rates it as a 'good' behavior, I execute the program.
<br>
<p>Now, why I said 'most human behavior' and 'rarely conscious'
<br>
is because we usually do not apply the process I've outlined
<br>
in the previous paragraph to much of what we do (brushing
<br>
our teeth, driving our car, etc.)  We have a set of 'known good'
<br>
behaviors and almost always do precisely what the zombie does
<br>
which is send them to the output port(s) without looking
<br>
at them.  In fact, we actually promote this 'zombie'-like
<br>
behavior as a significant human achievement because some
<br>
of the best sport performances in sports like diving,
<br>
gymnastics, ice-skating, etc. happen too fast for you
<br>
to run a conscious 'sim' and evaluate the result.  We
<br>
achieve these states by running the 'sims' mentally
<br>
and in the real world over and over and over again
<br>
until they become 'known good behaviors' and can reliably
<br>
dumped from the lookup tables to the output ports.
<br>
<p>The reason why many people look 'stupid' most of the time and
<br>
we all manage to look 'stupid' some of the time is because
<br>
we act unconsciously.  Either we weren't paying attention to
<br>
'consciously' stop a 'bad' behavior from getting sent
<br>
to the output ports (e.g. &quot;Now, why on earth did I do that?&quot;)
<br>
or we did not map the inputs onto the lookup table (perhaps
<br>
because we were not 'conscious' enough of the inputs to
<br>
verify them in sufficient depth (e.g.  &quot;Are you saying what
<br>
I think you are saying?&quot; etc.).
<br>
<p>If anyone want to study this further, I can recomend you review
<br>
the writings of the Russian mystic Gurdjieff.
