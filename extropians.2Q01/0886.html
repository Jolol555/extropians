Here is my shot at shell design:
<br>
<p>I base this on what I call Hyper Orbital Velocity Mass or HOVM.  Suppose you
<br>
wanted to build a really big particle accelerator ring in empty space.  You
<br>
could envision a ring of big beam turning magnets that are each quite far from
<br>
each other.  A problem with this is that when you turn on the beam, it will
<br>
produce a force against the steering magnets which will cause them to move away
<br>
from each other, enlarging the ring.  The solution is, of course, to build this
<br>
somewhere where the magnets can orbit something (the easier case anyway) and cut
<br>
the orbital velocity of the magnets to match the outward force exerted by the
<br>
beam.  Well, as the particle beam has more mass, and that mass is made to go
<br>
faster, the orbital velocity of the ring of magnets can be made less and less.
<br>
<p>This principal can be extrapolated to support a spherical shell around a central
<br>
mass.  I suggest mag lev mass drivers in place of the particle beams because
<br>
subatomic particles radiate photons like mad when you turn them, but it is the
<br>
same idea.  You would build a shell within which mass is driven at hyper orbital
<br>
velocity in all directions, perhaps in tubes.  The interwoven tubes are worked
<br>
out such that the HOVM inside them will result in a net zero angular momentum
<br>
for the sphere.
<br>
<p>By the way, the HOVM need not be dead mass.  There is nothing to keep that from
<br>
being some kind of functional devices, trucking systems, or even whole mini
<br>
worlds.  It just needs to keep moving around the inside of the sphere.  (Reminds
<br>
me of the old circus motorcycle loop the loop stunt.)
<br>
<p>Given that this idea produces a stationary sphere, you need some means of
<br>
keeping the star in position.  Given a reasonable system to move heat around the
<br>
shell, you could do this by redistribution of the waste heat that you are
<br>
radiating into deep space.  If you want to move a hemisphere closer to the star,
<br>
you would increase the waste heat radiation on that side to increase the photon
<br>
recoil thrust, which would start moving the shell.
<br>
<p>I do not know if this kind of structure has been proposed yet, but if so, I am
<br>
sure you will let me know.
