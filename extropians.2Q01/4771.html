<em>&gt;&gt; This is something Ive wondered about.  If someone manages
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to create a seed AI very early in human history, such as now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this year, the computer infrastructure would be still insufficient
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's enough computing power on the Internet right now - or, as Eugene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leitl and Christine Peterson prefer to call it, &quot;poorly defended&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing power - for transhumanity.
</em><br>
<p><p>This does not follow, and it baffles me that so many relatively
<br>
knowledgeable people have simply accepted it.  Distributed computing,
<br>
*particularly* over slow high-latency links, is totally unsuitable for a
<br>
very large percentage of the algori›hm space (and essentially *every*
<br>
plausible AI architecture).  For many types of problems you can't
<br>
automagically have vast quantities of computational capability simply by
<br>
harnessing the Internet. In fact, for most problems you would lose
<br>
performance by distributing it over the Internet.  And there are many
<br>
classes of hard problems (such as protein folding) that are arguably
<br>
intractable for all practical purposes even if you had the computational
<br>
power of Internet connected computers at your disposal.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this misconception is common because very few programmers have
<br>
experience with distributed computing and the mathematical/engineering
<br>
limitations imposed by it.  If what is being posited in this thread (re: AI
<br>
singularity via the Internet) was actually possible, silicon cores would
<br>
have evolved differently than they have over the last decade or two.  I
<br>
think most people who are actually knowledgeable about distributed computing
<br>
would either 1) find this idea laughable for reasons that would be obvious
<br>
to them, or more likely 2) would attach some severe caveats and restrictions
<br>
as to the requisite nature and structure of AI that I think most AI
<br>
researchers would claim makes the possibility untenable.  Note that this is
<br>
based on the infrastructure that we have today, and that this applies to the
<br>
infrastructure we are likely to have for quite some time.
<br>
<p>Spike is right; the existing computer infrastructure today is totally
<br>
inadequate for a &quot;fast&quot; takeoff via an Internet AI.  Undefended computing
<br>
power is absolutely worthless if it is unusable as a distributed computing
<br>
resource for most intents and purposes.  It should however, be possible with
<br>
today's technology to build an environment that can incrementally increase
<br>
the net performance of an AI by adding networked resources on an extremely
<br>
local basis.  A usable basement AI without the ability to take over the
<br>
Internet is perfectly feasible and far more realistic, at least for the next
<br>
several years.
