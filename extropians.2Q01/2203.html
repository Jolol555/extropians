<p><em>&gt;Might you specify the working definition of Agnostic you had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in mind? (is it all in the &quot;AND&quot; for you?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How do you define &quot;Zennist&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>In my definition an agnostic is someone who largely holds the idea
<br>
of God to be currently unknowable. As I stated previously, I
<br>
believe that we do not know enough about the universe to say with
<br>
certainty that a God does not exist. (an error of atheists IMMHO)
<br>
Or that if there is, this God is vastly different than what is
<br>
taught by the world's religions. 
<br>
<p>For example, I have a problem with the notion that any intelligent
<br>
being would insist on being worshiped. I find it hard to conceive
<br>
of an active intelligence would allow 40,000 children a day to
<br>
starve to death on this planet.
<br>
<p>I realize religions have pat (unacceptable) answers to these
<br>
questions.
<br>
<p>Of course a wise person would simply take Pascal's wager (Blaise,
<br>
look it up) and say they believe. Come to think of it, I repent!!
<br>
<p>A Zennist is a practitioner of Zen without necessarily being a
<br>
buddhist, although there are so many varieties of buddhism I
<br>
probably fit into one of them. Essentially the difficulty for me is
<br>
the death penalty. I see it as an appropriate punishment.
<br>
<p>In buddhist cosmology the universe is intelligent without there
<br>
being a central figure.
