<p>Well, I do mention it. 
<br>
<p>Genetics, in the guise of biotechnology, is a very likely precursor to dry 
<br>
nanotech and quite possibly an integral part of much advanced nanotech (OK, 
<br>
everybody is going to complain about the 4 billion year old legacy system, 
<br>
but the sheer number of available libraries for it makes it competitive).
<br>
<p>Genetic therapy and modifications might also become relevant. We already know 
<br>
enough to start making them, and there are more and more genes with 
<br>
interesting properties to tempt us. In the long run a biobody can only go so 
<br>
far, but in the short run it is about our own (and out childrens) skin. 
<br>
<p>As you say, they take time, but at present we cannot say anything about the 
<br>
speed AI or advanced nanotech will appear. As for AI (which I somehow suspect 
<br>
is close to your heart :-) we do not at present have any proof-of-concept 
<br>
(beside the wetware one) or research tree that is likely to lead up to it (as 
<br>
in the nanotech case). It is a bit a &quot;jack in the box&quot;-technology: at present 
<br>
you cannot predict when it will jump out. This makes dismissing everything 
<br>
else a bit premature.
