<em>&gt; Now, why is Keith the 2nd most famous extropian?  Well I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not doing any &quot;filtering&quot; for identity homonyms.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would appear that from Google's point of view:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Anders &gt; Keith &gt; Max &gt; Damien &gt;&gt; yours truly or Greg
</em><br>
<p>You have to be a little careful with these Google counts.  If you do a
<br>
search on &quot;Hal Finney&quot; you will find a couple of hits on the first page
<br>
about some 1930s baseball player.  I suspect there's only one Max More on
<br>
the net, but Anders Sandberg seems to be a name shared by at least a few
<br>
other people.
<br>
<p>I doubt that our Anders is also the professional hockey player shown at
<br>
<a href="http://www2.corren.se/sidor/tidningen/9811/19/Sport_o_Fritid/ISHOCKEY2.HTM">http://www2.corren.se/sidor/tidningen/9811/19/Sport_o_Fritid/ISHOCKEY2.HTM</a>,
<br>
or is the L. Anders Sandberg who is the author of the book &quot;Sustainability,
<br>
The Challenge&quot; at <a href="http://www.umu.se/cerum/publikationer/info/publ_nsb1_98.html">http://www.umu.se/cerum/publikationer/info/publ_nsb1_98.html</a>,
<br>
or is the president of the Stokholm Rotary Club, <a href="http://www.cm.se/rotary/Styrelse.htm">http://www.cm.se/rotary/Styrelse.htm</a>.
<br>
(Or maybe he is!)
<br>
<p>I think most of the hits are for the &quot;real&quot; Anders but a certain
<br>
percentage are for imposters.  Likewise for other people, depending
<br>
on how common their name is, as with me and that baseball player.
