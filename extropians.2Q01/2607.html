<p><em>&gt;Followed to its logical extreme, one concludes if the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;closed, we have been here before, having this exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion. Furthermore we have been here an *infinite* number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;times before. Still further, we will be here again, having this exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion and an unimaginably large number of similar but slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different versions thereof. Thinking about it causes one to zone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out. Amara has so aptly described the feeling as staring into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abyss until it stares back.
</em><br>
<p>I borrowed the expression from Nietzche, although our context was
<br>
likely different.
<br>
<p>&quot;He who fights monsters should be careful lest he thereby becomes a
<br>
monster. And if thou gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will also
<br>
gaze into thee&quot;    _Beyond Good and Evil_  Nietzsche
<br>
<p>I didn't read _Beyond Good and Evil_, but he uses the abyss often in
<br>
his writings, and he has a fondness for this particular state of
<br>
mind. See _Thus Spake Zarathustra_
<br>
<p><a href="http://eserver.org/philosophy/nietzsche-zarathustra.txt">http://eserver.org/philosophy/nietzsche-zarathustra.txt</a>
<br>
<p>Nietzsche was also a little bit insane, but then ...
<br>
<p>&quot;I prefer to be only slightly insane. (Don't we all?)&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;--Characters Captain Sheridan and Garabaldi on Babylon 5
<br>
(see my special quotes <a href="http://www.amara.com/aboutme/favquotes.html">http://www.amara.com/aboutme/favquotes.html</a>)
<br>
<p>My context for the abyss is close to the Zen practices and their use
<br>
of the deep abyss. The deep abyss is that psychological place where
<br>
there's no support, no nothing, a complete free-fall, and you realize
<br>
that no one is going to save you but yourself. It can be a terrifying
<br>
realization, and it might require sitting there for a while and not
<br>
run away from yourself, in other words: 'having a tea with yourself'
<br>
(my context of staring into the abyss). However, once one realizes
<br>
that they are all they have, then the abyss is a very rich place to
<br>
plant seeds of yourself to grow.  Then what comes of that abyss is
<br>
someone/something genuine and an integrated whole.
<br>
<p>Actually everyone has that psychological place of the deep abyss, but
<br>
I would guess that many people don't notice because their lives have
<br>
many kinds of supports and distractions.
