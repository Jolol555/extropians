</em><br>
<p>As long as you keep running everything through that hyper-individualistic
<br>
jingo filter, you'll never understand how complex social systems actually
<br>
work. It's easy to say that the Chinese people are &quot;satisfied with being a
<br>
serf or slave&quot; while sitting here safe and happy in our more enlightened
<br>
society, but we don't ordinarily get shot for expressing dissenting
<br>
viewpoints (at least, not any more). It's a common fallacy among people who
<br>
have had freedom for many generations to place undue emphasis on the
<br>
responsibility of each individual in a more repressed society, but it's
<br>
just not that simple. Individualism has little to do with it. Social forces
<br>
&amp; pressures are powerful and overwhelming, and the dissemination of
<br>
information is tightly controlled. Mix this with a basic fear for one's
<br>
safety &amp; the safety of one's family, and it's easy to understand why
<br>
individuals aren't willing or able to stand up to a repressive regime.
<br>
Paranoia is rampant.
<br>
<p>Now I'm not saying that the Chinese people aren't collectively responsible
<br>
for their own lot, because in many ways they are. But it's really more of a
<br>
group dynamic than something that can be pinned on any one person. And it
<br>
will take a group effort to change things, just like it always has. We here
<br>
in the West, and the US in particular, have the privilege of being at the
<br>
end of a many-generations-long struggle to win and refine individual
<br>
freedom. Sometimes we forget how many people had to fight and die to
<br>
achieve this for us. The Chinese have only been at it for a half-century,
<br>
and unfortunately their first time out they replaced one form of
<br>
totalitarianism with another. Calling them fat and complacent is an
<br>
arrogant and insulting over-simplification.
