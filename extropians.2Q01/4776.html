<p>Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20AI%20over%20the%20Internet%20(was%20Re:%20making%20microsingularities)&In-Reply-To=&lt;200105280047.RAA13957@finney.org&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;, writes:

<em>&gt; I'm sure you can do a mathematical proof that the Internet is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dumbfoundingly slow if you want to maintain S=1, as in the human brain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the characteristic communication delay time from an element to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other element is on the order of the a single tick of a computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element's clock speed.  But all that analysis proves is that cognition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distributed over the Internet has very high S and that local packets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind are isolated for millions, billions, or even trillions of ticks. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, you can say nothing at all about how much of an inefficiency this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represents at the *cognitive* level.
</em><br>
<p>I think the only correct statement we can make at this point is that
<br>
we don't know whether it would be possible to do human- or superhuman-
<br>
level AI using an architecture like the Internet.  Perhaps current
<br>
approaches to AI don't parallelize very well, but of course they don't
<br>
come anywhere near to human level AI either.
<br>
<p>James is right that it seems that only a small fraction of problems can
<br>
exploit the kind of parallelism found on the net, but Eliezer is right
<br>
that we don't know whether it would be possible to design a cognitive
<br>
architecture which could run efficiently there.
<br>
<p>There does seem to be a stumbling block if the AI needs the net's
<br>
resources to become superhuman, but it can't exploit them until it
<br>
achieves superhuman competence sufficient to redesign itself to run on
<br>
such a constrained system as the net.  But Eliezer points out that it
<br>
does not need superhuman competence in every arena, only in software
<br>
architecture design, and perhaps an idiot savant super-coder AI can make
<br>
the leap.
