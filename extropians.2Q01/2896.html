<p><em>&gt;That notion about evolutionary pressure towards humans having

<p>Not necessarily. The evolutionary pressure is presumably psuhing toward
<br>
where it's stabilized at (and of course it's cephalization index, ratio of
<br>
brain/body, that's the key, not absolute size). I'd guess that what's
<br>
happening isn't the result of pressure TOWARD X, so much as relief of
<br>
pressure AGAINST X. There's always going to be stochastic variation in all
<br>
these physical characteristics (most recently augmented by excellent
<br>
nutrition), but in the past many of the outliers died, taking their mothers
<br>
with them. That could be construed as evolutionary pressure against
<br>
excessive smarts, but it was just a side-consequence of other pleiotropic
<br>
factors. Now, using a knife, a clean room, scrubbed staff and a whiff of
<br>
anaesthesia, we open the phase space. Praise Caesar!
<br>
<p>I like Friedman's idea that there should be selection pressure toward what
<br>
amounts to Coneheads. I don't buy his neural reasoning against this. But
<br>
note: if hypertrophied intelligence is a side-effect of extra large
<br>
cortical area (all things being equal), it must have had  no overwhelming
<br>
advantage in our classic evolutionary environment; today it has only a
<br>
*neutral* impact, or worse, if it really does conduce to smaller `selfish'
<br>
family size.
