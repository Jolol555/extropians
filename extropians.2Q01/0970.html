</em><br>
<p>Actually, the reason for the humans is a bit better than just making
<br>
things expensive. First, robotics and AI in this scenario isn't quite
<br>
up to par, and second the initial base is intended to be expanded into
<br>
a fairly large habitat-builder complex.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In reality I would likely go for autonomous systems and microsats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The crew will have to spend a long time in microgravity; I have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; toying with the idea of rotating the ship but I'm not sure it would be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why don't you just have the biotech engineers come up with a drug that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulates the stress-signals produced by gravity (or amplifies those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced naturally, so you can cut the treadmill time down to something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable).
</em><br>
<p>Because I want to torture my players with my rules for bone
<br>
decalcification :-) Actually, it is not obvious that you can convince
<br>
bone cells that they are being stressed without real mechanical
<br>
stress. The biotech in my scenario might come up with something, but
<br>
it will take a while (space colonisaton has up to the moment the
<br>
storyline starts not been a high priority for anybody). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The business plan is rather long-range and mainly interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; building the industrial infrastructure needed for large scale habitat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production (of which there is a predicted tremendous jump in demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within 20 years of the start of the operation, due to external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; factors).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Long range business plans can only be financed by very rich people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; VC &amp; Investment bankers wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can of course wait until 20 years when a new generation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hot-shots thinks they know everything and buy into the stupidest stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (The marketing plan for Iridium must now be a B-school classic.)
</em><br>
<p>In this scenario the reason for going into space at all is simply that
<br>
a form of runaway bio-goo slowly is overrunning the biosphere, and the
<br>
people behind the space effort calculate that the value of owning a
<br>
sizeable fraction of all human living space would outweigh the risk of
<br>
a project failure. Of course, the vast majority of people and
<br>
investors is betting (or just hoping) better biotech or nanotech will
<br>
solve the goo problem. But having a world filled with people with
<br>
nanowarfare capabilities is in itself a good reason to want to
<br>
emigrate. The investors in this case are a few national consortia and
<br>
long-range foundations with somewhat extropic agendas.
<br>
<p>I agree that this is a somewhat weak case, but then again, it is a
<br>
game. I try to make the science and economy as hard as suits the
<br>
story, but I do fudge a little bit to make (more) interesting things
<br>
possible.
