<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Position and Paradigm of a New Discipline
<br>
By Joe E. Dees
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Idea of Memetics
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976, Richard Dawkins published a book entitled THE 
<br>
SELFISH GENE, the object of which was to extend the principles 
<br>
of mutation via mutation and natural selection to sociocultural 
<br>
behavior.  To solidify the parallel, he coined the term &quot;meme&quot; to 
<br>
represent that which is passed on during the process of intentional 
<br>
or inadvertant intersubjective communication, communication being 
<br>
understood as comprised of transmission plus reception.  The term 
<br>
is a truncation of the greek root &quot;mimeme&quot;, meaning &quot;to imitate&quot; 
<br>
(and indeed the imitation of one's behavior by another is how it is 
<br>
seen that a meme has propagated), and is also connected, by 
<br>
Dawkins, with memory.  He stated that memes possess internal 
<br>
instantiation as memory traces, and are stored in the neural nets of 
<br>
their carriers.  According to Dawkins, to be successful, memes 
<br>
must possess three attributes; longevity, fecundity, and copying-
<br>
fidelity.  As with genes, fecundity is asserted to trump longevity; 
<br>
the life span of a particular memetic token is unimportant so long 
<br>
as it survives long enough to replicate itself widely with 
<br>
descendents that will do the same.  However, the longevity of the 
<br>
type of which any particular memetic instantiation is a token 
<br>
depends upon the meme type's (or memotype's) ability to perdure 
<br>
and maintain some kind of inhabitable niche in a changing 
<br>
sociocultural environment.  It does so by evolving; mutational 
<br>
variants are produced in individual minds through adaptation to, or 
<br>
assimilation by plus accommodation with, the cognitive 
<br>
environment in which they have been received.  The variants then 
<br>
compete with each other when their hosts attempt to transmit 
<br>
them; the variants that are more transmissable, that is, more 
<br>
amenable to reception by others, outpropagate their competitors.  
<br>
This entails that while a high degree of copying-fidelity is 
<br>
necessary for memes to reproduce, such fidelity cannot be 
<br>
absolute, for if all copys were perfect replicants of their 
<br>
promemitors, there would be no variants produced upon which 
<br>
selection could operate, and thus memetic evolution could not 
<br>
occur.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Various Memetic Paradigms
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawkins proposed two models for the operation of memes; the 
<br>
genetic paradigm and the viral paradigm.  The genetic paradigm 
<br>
envisages memes as passed from one person to another via 
<br>
communicative rather than sexual reproduction.  The point at which 
<br>
this analogy breaks down is that of the structural character of the 
<br>
reproduction of memes; when two members of a species engage in 
<br>
successful reproduction, at least one other member that 
<br>
possesses some of the genes of each progenitor results, but when 
<br>
two or more people engage in successful memetic reproduction, 
<br>
the meme(s) possessed by one of them (but not the other or 
<br>
others) are transmitted to and received by an other or others; in 
<br>
other words, memetic reproduction may be one-to-many rather 
<br>
than being restricted to being between two, and other members of 
<br>
the species are not created in the process.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viral paradigm envisages memes as infecting their hosts 
<br>
and co-opting their behavioral capacities to produce more copies of 
<br>
themselves.  This analogy breaks down at at least two points.  
<br>
First, while viruses produce copies of themselves using hijacked 
<br>
cellular reproduction capacities, the behaviors produced by memes 
<br>
are not exact copies of themselves, inasmuch as the encoding is 
<br>
different in cognitive neural nets, in behavior, and in behavior-
<br>
produced artifacts.  Second, viral infections do not compete with 
<br>
other viral infections in the host, but memes must compete with 
<br>
other memes to gain and maintain their niches in the cognitive 
<br>
environment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paradigm I favor I call the species paradigm; in this 
<br>
paradigm, memes are analogous to species, and the cognitive 
<br>
environments within which they exist and between which they 
<br>
reproduce are analogous to ecologies, populated by other species 
<br>
of memes with which they must compete for their niches.  The 
<br>
basic difference between this paradigm and its referent, species 
<br>
competition, is that there is not just one cognitive environment 
<br>
involved; each transmitted and received meme finds itself in a new 
<br>
cognitive ecology, complete with a different set of memes with 
<br>
which it must compete for its niche.  The analogy to species 
<br>
competition would be precise if there existed many different worlds 
<br>
with dissemination occuring between them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Life Cycle of a Meme
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memes are comprised of internal instantiations (within minds) 
<br>
and external instantiations (between minds).  Both of these modes 
<br>
are necessary for memetic evolution to occur.  Internal 
<br>
instantiations of memes are required for the mutational production 
<br>
of meme variants, as it is here that competition and recombination 
<br>
between memes within the cognitive gestalt provokes memetic 
<br>
mutations that can more successfully secure and maintain their 
<br>
niches.  External instantiations are required for differential selection 
<br>
to occur; variants transmitted via their encoding in imitatible 
<br>
actions, such as performances, communication and the production 
<br>
of artifacts, are more or less successfully received by other 
<br>
cognitive environments.  Both mutation and selection are 
<br>
necessary for memetic evolution to occur.
<br>
<p>4. Memetics; Hard Science, Soft Science, or Philosophical Stance?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selfsame tokens of a memotype must be encoded 
<br>
differently in different cognitive environments, due to the necessity 
<br>
of defining their identities with respect to the differing sets of 
<br>
competing memes to be found there.  This necessity entails that 
<br>
memetics cannot aspire to the hard science status of disciplines 
<br>
such as physics or chemistry, where all particular electrons, atoms 
<br>
of an element, and molecules of a compound are exact tokens of a 
<br>
type.  This exact duplication is not necessary in soft sciences, 
<br>
such as sociology, anthropology, political science or economics, 
<br>
so memetics logically could attain soft science status.  
<br>
Pragmatically, however, the isolation and identification of various 
<br>
neural configuration in multiple brains as tokens of a particular 
<br>
memetic type is far beyond our current or near-term future 
<br>
capacities; therefore, for the forseeable future, memetice must 
<br>
remain a philosophical stance with soft science tendencies.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  Memetics in Relation to Other Philosophical Stances
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phenomenology and genetic epistemology are philosophical 
<br>
stances in relation to the realm of the being of consciousness, 
<br>
while semiotics and memetics are philosophical stances in relation 
<br>
to the realm of conscious meaning, or that which the being of 
<br>
consciousness contains.  As phenomenology and genetic 
<br>
epistemology are complementary disciplines with relation to the 
<br>
being of consciousness, so semiotics and memetics complement 
<br>
each other in relation to consciously held meanings.  
<br>
Phenomenology and semiotics are synchronic, or statically 
<br>
structural (the focus-field-fringe structure of perception is one such 
<br>
phenomenological structure; the signifier-sign-signified structure of 
<br>
signification is a semiotic structure); genetic epistemology and 
<br>
memetics are diachronic, or dynamically functional, developmental 
<br>
and evolutionary.  Phenomenology does not address the question 
<br>
of how self-conscious awareness could have evolved, but accepts 
<br>
its developmentally matured structures as ground conditions to be 
<br>
derived and described; genetic epistemology, by studying the 
<br>
emergence of the structures of self-conscious awareness in the 
<br>
developing child, can offer insights into how such an awareness 
<br>
might have evolved during the evolution of the species.  Likewise, 
<br>
semiotics does not adress the question of how symbolic capacity 
<br>
could have evolved, accepting its fully matured structures as 
<br>
ground conditions to be extracted and diagrammatically delineated, 
<br>
while memetics, by studying the transmission of symbolicity from 
<br>
the caregiver to the child and its progressive internaization by that 
<br>
child, implicitly offers suggestions as to how a species possessing 
<br>
symbolic capacity could have evolved - suggestions which I 
<br>
pursued in my paper TOOLS, LANGUAGE AND TEXT.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both phenomenology and semiotics aspired to the status of 
<br>
rigorous theoretical science, but both failed; phenomenology due to 
<br>
its inability to plumb the depths of sedimentation - the 
<br>
preconscious structures underlying the structures of self-conscious 
<br>
awareness, semiotics due to its inability to extricate itself from the 
<br>
semiotic web wherein meanings mutually define in relation to each 
<br>
other and get beneath the sign to anchor those meanings in actual 
<br>
concrete lived world referents.Genetic epistemology is considered 
<br>
a soft science (a main branch of developmental psychology) due to 
<br>
its grounding in the logical induction of successions of developing 
<br>
cognitive structures from the experimentally controlled observation 
<br>
of behavior in children, and does not have to concern itself with the 
<br>
neural traces which encode specific structure (or memes).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Memes and Memeplexes
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Dawkins, A meme is the minimum imitatible that 
<br>
possesses copying fidelity; variants may differ, but must be similar 
<br>
enough to be recognizable as tokens of a memotype.  Daniel C. 
<br>
Dennett, in his 1995 book DARWIN'S DANGEROUS IDEA, 
<br>
disagrees, viewing each variant as sui generis, and a different 
<br>
meme.  I tend to side with dawkins in this dispute; individual 
<br>
people, while different, are similar enough to be identifiable as 
<br>
members of Homo Sapiens Sapiens; genetic, viral and species 
<br>
paradigms, while different, are similar enough to be identifiable as 
<br>
models of evolution, and each can thus not only be said to be a 
<br>
variant of the meme 'evolution', but also remain capable, like 
<br>
humans on the genetic level, of cross-fertilization.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Groups of memes frequently associate into mutually assisting 
<br>
systems termed memeplexes when their interrelation increases the 
<br>
propagational chances of all components of the memeplex.  Some 
<br>
memes may be components of several memeplexes; for instance, 
<br>
the proselytization meme is found in several religions and political 
<br>
ideologies, and indeed must be associated with other memes that 
<br>
can furnish it with a content it may proselytize.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Memes, Language and Meaning
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious way in which memes are propagated in our 
<br>
culture is through spoken, signed and written language.  It has 
<br>
been asserted that the search for basic memes should concentrate 
<br>
not on the levels of words or of phrases, but beneath them, on the 
<br>
level of the morpheme.  While there are memetic values to many 
<br>
morphemes, such as prefixes and suffixes, these are in reality 
<br>
syntactic shorthands for ideas semantically grounded in words and 
<br>
phrases, such as past, present, future, lack of, surplus of, in favor 
<br>
of, in opposition to, beneath, beyond, singular, plural, and so on.  
<br>
What is important in memetics is not the syntactic form of a 
<br>
meme, or how it is encoded, but its semantic content, that is, its 
<br>
significance or meaning; this comprises the identity of a particular 
<br>
meme, as well as its differentiation from other memes.  This is why 
<br>
the extraction of the structures in which meaning is presented, in 
<br>
isolation from the meaning so encoded, does not address 
<br>
memetics per se, and has more to do with linguistics or semiotics. 
<br>
Here certain parallels can be drawn to genetic epistemology; it is 
<br>
not the structure of perception (as in phenomenology) which are 
<br>
pertinent for genetic epistemology, but the principles they reveal, 
<br>
such as identity, permanence, conservation of quantities, 
<br>
reciprocality, contingency, causality, possibility, necessity, 
<br>
negation and opposition, which become progressively more 
<br>
apparent during the sequential succession of developmental 
<br>
structures.  There is a bridge here between being and meaning; 
<br>
although they are based in the perception of the being of the world, 
<br>
these principles which are drawn from world-perception 
<br>
meaningfully inform and organize it in turn.  By categorizing 
<br>
perception and characterizing the perceived as structured in certain 
<br>
ways and not others, these principles are a primordial source of the 
<br>
meanings recursively imposed upon being; meanings the 
<br>
imposition of which is valid precisely because they are grounded in 
<br>
and derived from that very being 
<br>
upon which they are subsequently imposed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. What Use Is Memetics?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the academic empirical work that is recognizeably memetic in nature so 
<br>
far was done in othe fields before memetics, as a discipline, was born.  This 
<br>
is hardly surprising, such fields as the diffusion of innovations, kinship 
<br>
theory, linguistics, information theiry and the sociology of knowledge have 
<br>
been around for quite some time, and the very term 'memetics' is only a quarter 
<br>
century old.  Its main use in the near term most likely will be to provide a 
<br>
common theoretical framework within which the fruit of the labors of these far 
<br>
flung disciplines may be interrelated, so that the sum of this work, taken 
<br>
together, may provide us with insights which none of the parts, 
<br>
taken alone, can proffer.  Its methodology will almost certainly be 
<br>
statistical, and it has a good chance of revolutionalizing one 
<br>
discipline in particular - the discipline of social psychology.  The 
<br>
going will not be easy; the subject matter of memetics - the 
<br>
problems of the genesis, evolution, and communication of meaning, 
<br>
are, due to their complexity, some of the most intractable in the 
<br>
field of academic endeavor.  But if the utilization of the unifying 
<br>
evolutionary perspective and principles of memetics serves to 
<br>
render merely very difficult that which has heretofore been 
<br>
insoluble, it wlll have more than fulfilled its promise.
