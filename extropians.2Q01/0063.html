Not to be rude (since that's what started this, the idea of politeness),
<br>
but do you KNOW any muslims, or are you just getting this 2nd hand? I
<br>
happen to be learning Arabic from a muslim, and he is quite well educated,
<br>
liberal, and willing to discuss anything I ask. Is he an anomoly? I can't
<br>
say, since I don't know every muslim, but then neither do you. You're
<br>
making assumptions based (unless you tell me differently) on perceptions
<br>
gathered from American media. Dangerous way to do things, since the news is
<br>
skewed, even if by accident. Some muslims are repressive, but most aren't.
<br>
(And some Christians are, also, so it's not limited to Islam).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I'm an atheist, so the religion means nothing to me, but
<br>
it does have a fairly strong history of being open to science, education
<br>
and discussion. For you to say that some small minority speaks for all of
<br>
them (even if that minority wishes you were right) tells me you simply
<br>
don't understand the issue. This is exactly the way to make sure muslim
<br>
countries stay opposed to our ideas.

<em>&gt; I hardly think being asked to be polite is a good reason not to discuss
</em><br>
something with someone.
<br>
<p>I think you've got it backwards. It's Muslims who refuse to discuss
<br>
something.
