Eliezer S. Yudkowsky used different fingers than I use to type,
<br>
<em>&gt; 3)  WHY THE HELL AREN'T YOU USING A DVORAK KEYBOARD?  Did you even TRY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it?  Just once in your life?  Doesn't continuing to use Qwerty indicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that sheer mental inertia is just about the only driving factor in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life?
</em><br>
<p>The QWERTY design is reputed to be far inferior to the &quot;scientifically&quot;
<br>
designed Dvorak keyboard which claimed to offer a 40% increase in typing
<br>
speed. Supposedly, the Navy conducted experiments during the Second World War
<br>
demonstrating that the costs of retraining typists on the new keyboard could
<br>
be fully recovered within ten days! According to the path dependency theories,
<br>
no producers found it profitable to create Dvorak keyboards since everyone
<br>
already knew QWERTY, and no one learned Dvorak because there were no Dvorak
<br>
keyboards.
<br>
<p>This is an ideal example, which accounts for its continued use by virtually
<br>
every author looking for an example of path dependence. The number of
<br>
dimensions of performance are few and in these dimensions the Dvorak keyboard
<br>
appears overwhelmingly superior.
<br>
<p>Yet upon investigation, this story appears to be based on nothing more than
<br>
wishful thinking and a shoddy reading of the history of the typewriter
<br>
keyboard. The QWERTY keyboard, it turns out, is about as good a design as the
<br>
Dvorak keyboard, and was better than most competing designs that existed in
<br>
the late 1800s when there were many keyboard designs maneuvering for a place
<br>
in the market.
<br>
<p>Ignored in these stories of Dvorak's superiority is a carefully controlled
<br>
experiment conducted under the auspices of the General Service Administration
<br>
in the 1950s comparing QWERTY with Dvorak. That experiment contradicted the
<br>
claims made by advocates of Dvorak and concluded that it made no sense to
<br>
retrain typists on the Dvorak keyboard. This study, which was influential in
<br>
its time, brought to an end any serious efforts to shift from QWERTY to
<br>
Dvorak. Modern research in ergonomics also reaches similar conclusions. This
<br>
research consists of simulations and experiments that compare various keyboard
<br>
designs. It finds little advantage in the Dvorak keyboard layout, confirming
<br>
the results of the GSA study.
<br>
<p>So on what basis were the claims of Dvorak's superiority made? We discovered
<br>
that most, if not all, of the claims of Dvorak's superiority can be traced to
<br>
the patent owner, Professor August Dvorak. His book on the relative merits of
<br>
QWERTY versus his own keyboard has about as much objectivity as a modern
<br>
infomercial found on late night television. The wartime Navy study turns out
<br>
to have been conducted under the auspices the Navy's chief expert in
<br>
time-motion studies -- Lt. Commander August Dvorak, and the results of that
<br>
study were clearly fudged. The study also appears to be lacking in anything
<br>
remotely related to objectivity. The difficulties that we had getting a copy
<br>
of the Navy study, and the fact that it is mentioned, but never actually
<br>
cited, convinced us that those economists enamored of the Dvorak fable never
<br>
actually perused a copy of that study.
<br>
<p>Many other aspects of the received story were also erroneous. It turns out
<br>
that there was intense competition between producers of various keyboard
<br>
designs early in the history of the typewriter keyboard. And contrary to prior
<br>
claims, there were many typing competitions between touch typists on various
<br>
keyboard designs, and QWERTY won its share of such competitions. Thus QWERTY
<br>
was put through a fairly severe set of tests by the market, and the reason
<br>
QWERTY survives seems to be that it is a reasonably good design.
<br>
<p>We published a very detailed account of all this the Journal of Law and
<br>
Economics in the spring of 1990. Yet in spite of this five year old paper,
<br>
which has not been factually disputed, economists working on path dependence
<br>
topics continue to use the QWERTY keyboard as the main example to support
<br>
their theory that markets cannot be trusted to choose products. One could
<br>
hardly find better evidence of this theory's lack of empirical support than
<br>
the continued use of a result that is known to be incorrect. The QWERTY story,
<br>
by the way, is cited in Reback's paper (his footnote 44).

<p>Also, Dvorak keyboards are not on my favorite notebook computers.
