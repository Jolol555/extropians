Some of you may find this interesting on the whole open vs. closed door
<br>
Science, the politics of calming populations, eating meat in Europe, etc.
<br>
<p>Its from FAST (<a href="http://www.france-science.org/english">http://www.france-science.org/english</a>).

<p><em>&gt; ** ONLY MAD COWS AND ENGLISHMEN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Last week's high-level symposium on prion diseases organized in Paris by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Medicine and the British Academy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medical Science made news for several reasons. The subject is red hot in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe that is weary of the slaughter and wary of the human epidemic to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come, and the conference attracted all the top research actors in the field
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the American Nobel laureate and prion discoverer Stanley
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prusiner. It also attracted attention at the highest levels of power as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin both made appearances while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vying for the Most Concerned Leader award, and government ministers took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns ensuring that there was always high-level presence throughout the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three-day event. Newsworthy also was who didn't attend, as a decision to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold the symposium behind closed doors met with a good deal of criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including from among the event's scientific participants. Rumor had it that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the British co-hosts insisted upon this condition, while defenders of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision cited the sensationalist press' penchant for distortion. (Critics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argued that tabloid reporters are rarely seen hanging about scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confabs.)  Some researchers questioned the wisdom of giving the public the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression that the scientific community has something to hide on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, but what did finally make it out of the closed sessions is a clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression of befuddlement as well as disagreement. Prion disease experts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have trouble reaching any kind of consensus about the dimensions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming epidemic of new-form Creutzfeldt-Jakob, some saying there will be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epidemic, with few further casualties beyond the nearly 100 victims already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Great Britain, others saying there will most assuredly be more to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but no telling on what scale. Most specialists agree that the fact of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geneless proteins morphing into killers relativizes genetic supremacy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the prion's practically inert status pushes the boundaries of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life. At conference end, the very Socratic wisdom of identifying how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one doesn't know seemed to be the principal scientific outcome; no one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure what role prions play either in BSE (mad cow disease) or in new-form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CJ, and little is known of the pathology of prion disease, its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmission, or its gestation period. French Health Minister Bernard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kouchner summed up hindsight consensus in his closing speech by underlining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the folly of converting herbivores to carnivores and even to cannibals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ensuing monumental error of allowing nerve tissue scraps to find there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way into burgers (consensual best guess as to how new-form CJ got its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start). One bright spot is France's commitment to tripling its prion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research budget to more than $30 million. As one British scientist pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in admiration, that is the equivalent of 12 times more per mad French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cow than the UK is currently spending per mad British cow (Libération,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; March 14, p21,Corinne Bensimon; Agence France Presse, March 16)
