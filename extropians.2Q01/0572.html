Fresh off Reuters news, new brain cells quickly pick up an active role in
<br>
memory function. More cause for optimism about brain repair and enhancement.

Memories Are Made of This -- New Brain Cells
<br>
By Patricia Reaney
<br>
LONDON (Reuters) - In a finding that could be good news for stroke sufferers
<br>
and people with brain diseases, scientists said Wednesday that the brains of
<br>
animals and humans can produce new cells that can help to form memories.
<br>
Researchers had been skeptical about the brain's ability to grow new cells.
<br>
But behavioral neuroscientists at Rutgers and Princeton universities in New
<br>
Jersey have shown not only that the brains of rats produce new cells, but
<br>
also what they do.
<br>
``It appears that the new neurons become involved in memory about a week to
<br>
two weeks after they are generated, and they are involved in memories
<br>
normally handled by the hippocampus (an area of the brain),'' said Professor
<br>
Tracey Shors of Rutgers.
<br>
She and her colleague Elizabeth Gould, of Princeton University, believe
<br>
their research suggests that the brain's recuperative powers may have been
<br>
underestimated and could be far greater than scientists had previously
<br>
thought.
<br>
``I think the idea that the brain continues to make new neurons and that
<br>
those neurons serve an important function gives us hopes that we can restore
<br>
function in people who have neurone loss,'' Shors said in a telephone
<br>
interview.
<br>
``On another level it may give ideas about trying to enhance the
<br>
self-renewing capacity of the brain.''
<br>
Jeffery Macklis, of Harvard Medical School (news - web sites) in
<br>
Massachusetts, went one step further, suggesting that the research could
<br>
have implications for the treatment of brain injuries or diseases.
<br>
``The results also support the idea that it might, one day, be possible to
<br>
add new, fully functional neurons into existing brain circuitry to treat
<br>
diseases of the nervous system,'' he said in a commentary on the research.
<br>
Shors and Gould found that in rats the newly generated neurons were
<br>
essential for 'trace memory', in which animals learn to associate stimuli
<br>
that are separated in time.
<br>
Shors and Gould gave male rats a drug that stopped the proliferation of new
<br>
cells for several weeks and then tested them with various learning tasks.
<br>
``They couldn't learn the trace conditioning tasks which require the
<br>
association of stimuli over time, but they could learn other tasks,'' Shors
<br>
explained.
<br>
The researchers are trying to identify exactly what role the cells play in
<br>
memory, and how sex differences influence memory and the generation of new
<br>
neurons.
