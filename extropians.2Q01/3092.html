<br>
<p><p>I am in the belly of the beast. I have risen early, traveled far, and
<br>
overcome lines, rudeness, and indifference. Now, heedless of my
<br>
chances of coming back without serious psychological or physical
<br>
injury, I am journeying into a swamp that has become a source of
<br>
boundless irritation, frustration, confusion -- even fury -- for tens
<br>
of millions of Americans. I open the door and step into a
<br>
customer-service call center. And not just any call center either --
<br>
one that is exclusively devoted to handling problems with
<br>
cell-phones. It's cool inside and fairly well lit, for a swamp.
<br>
<p>I am carrying the very tool itself: a Sprint PCS
<br>
cell-phone. I love my Sprint PCS cell-phone. But God
<br>
help me when I have to call Sprint PCS. I have
<br>
sometimes called this very building in Fort Worth,
<br>
Texas. Often, I'm not even sure that the customer-care
<br>
advocate I finally speak with after I've been waiting
<br>
on hold for 17 minutes even knows what a cell-phone
<br>
is.
<br>
<p>I have come here at the beginning of a long journey --
<br>
really, a quest of the sort that was common in
<br>
antiquity -- during which I will cross the continent
<br>
several times and seek out both oracles and common
<br>
folk. I am determined to unravel a central mystery of
<br>
life in modern America: Why is customer service so
<br>
terrible?
<br>
<p>At the Sprint PCS call center, I am soon teamed up
<br>
with customer-care advocate Chad Ehrlich, a gracious
<br>
29-year-old with years of experience delivering
<br>
service by phone. Chad takes a call from a businessman
<br>
in Lubbock, Texas. The man is upset about his bill: It
<br>
was running $60 to $100 a month. Suddenly, it has shot
<br>
up to $1,600. &quot;I'm not going to pay it!&quot; the man
<br>
declares.
<br>
<p>Chad is reserved. &quot;Let me take a look at that bill,&quot;
<br>
he says. Chad whirls through screens of
<br>
information. &quot;Hold on a moment for me, sir, I'm going
<br>
to get a representative from the fraud department on
<br>
the line.&quot; Chad puts Lubbock on hold and dials Sprint
<br>
PCS's fraud department, where he reaches a familiar
<br>
recorded message and is put on hold. Lubbock is on
<br>
hold for customer-service rep Chad, and
<br>
customer-service rep Chad is on hold for more customer
<br>
service.
<br>
<p>A female fraud rep takes Chad's call. She can see from
<br>
Lubbock's history that he's complained about this
<br>
problem before. The conversation between Chad and his
<br>
colleague in fraud is frisky.
<br>
<p>Fraud: &quot;He thought he was cloned, but he wasn't.&quot;
<br>
<p>Chad: &quot;His bills did go from almost nothing to
<br>
sky-high ...&quot;
<br>
<p>Fraud: &quot;We can send him to a cloning specialist and
<br>
make it 'official' if you want ...  &quot;
<br>
<p>Chad: &quot;He's denying that he made or received the
<br>
calls.&quot;
<br>
<p>The impatient woman from fraud dials the Sprint PCS
<br>
cloning customer-care department and ... is put on
<br>
hold.
<br>
<p>Do you ever wonder what's going on while you're
<br>
waiting on hold for customer service? Really, you
<br>
couldn't even imagine.
<br>
<p>Chad, Lubbock's customer-care advocate, is talking to
<br>
a woman who is Chad's customer-care advocate. She has
<br>
called her customer-care advocate, who is busy on
<br>
another call. So now we have two customer-care
<br>
advocates on hold waiting for a third customer-care
<br>
advocate. Meanwhile, a fuming customer from Lubbock (
<br>
who may or may not be trying to rip Sprint off for
<br>
$1,600 ) waits. On hold.
<br>
<p>That, right there, is customer service in the new
<br>
economy. It has become a slow, dissatisfying tangle of
<br>
telephones, computers, Web sites, email, and people
<br>
that wastes time at a prodigious rate, produces far
<br>
more aggravation than service, and, most often, leaves
<br>
you feeling impotent. What's even worse is that this
<br>
situation is a kind of betrayal. It wasn't supposed to
<br>
be this way. One of the promises of the new economy
<br>
was that the customer would finally be in charge. We
<br>
weren't supposed to need to call customer care -- but
<br>
if we did, then someone would take our call quickly. (
<br>
Why not? No one else would be calling. ) A
<br>
customer-service rep would understand our problem
<br>
practically before we mentioned it, and all would be
<br>
made right. Everyone believes in delighting the
<br>
customer.
<br>
<p>Don't you spend most of your day delighted? Here's a
<br>
puzzler. Why do we hear this sentence so often: &quot;We
<br>
are experiencing higher-than-usual call volumes... . &quot;
<br>
If you're experiencing higher-than-usual call volumes,
<br>
then why aren't you experiencing higher-than-usual
<br>
staffing volumes? How hard is that? What the new
<br>
economy has done to customer service is exactly the
<br>
opposite of what everyone predicted would happen. And
<br>
as chaotic a time as it has been to be a customer, it
<br>
has been a truly weird time to be delivering customer
<br>
service.  Consider just one example: Five years ago,
<br>
discount broker Charles Schwab had 1,450
<br>
customer-service reps in call centers, and 85% of
<br>
those reps' time was spent providing real-time quotes
<br>
and basic company information, and executing
<br>
trades. Those 1,450 people, sensing the Internet
<br>
roaring down on them, were worried about their
<br>
jobs. Rightfully so. At the end of this past year,
<br>
Charles Schwab's customers did 81% of all of those
<br>
activities without human assistance.  So you would
<br>
imagine that Schwab could have trimmed its costly
<br>
battalion of customer-service reps to 1,000, even to
<br>
500.
<br>
<p>In fact, the number of Schwab reps has tripled to
<br>
4,800. But they're not doing what they used to
<br>
do. Customers have demanded new vistas of service. No
<br>
one was more surprised than Schwab.
<br>
<p>In short, the new economy was supposed to make service
<br>
better, quicker, and more effective for customers --
<br>
and easier and cheaper for companies. None of that has
<br>
come to pass. What happened? I went on a journey to
<br>
find out.
<br>
<p><p>Bold Promises, Bad Results
<br>
<p>AT&amp;T is running television commercials for its
<br>
Worldnet Internet service. One ad features a series of
<br>
stand-up comics who are making jokes about the bad
<br>
customer service of their Internet providers ( &quot;My
<br>
online service is like my husband: I stare at it for
<br>
hours, hoping it will move&quot; ).
<br>
<p>Cisco is running a TV commercial that opens with a
<br>
regular guy on a cordless phone who hears, &quot;Your call
<br>
will be answered by the next available operator.&quot;
<br>
Halfway through the commercial, the man has fallen
<br>
asleep, phone to his ear.
<br>
<p>Mockery is a great cultural barometer. Bad customer
<br>
service is one of the universal -- and unifying --
<br>
experiences of being an American in the 21st
<br>
century. You get it at Wal-Mart. You get it at Lord &amp;
<br>
Taylor. But is customer service really worse than it
<br>
used to be? A panel of customer-service experts that I
<br>
assembled couldn't agree.
<br>
<p>Don Peppers, 50, of the Peppers and Rogers Group,
<br>
proponent of &quot;customer-relationship management&quot; and
<br>
coauthor of the famous One to One Future: &quot;I don't
<br>
think that customer service sucks. I think it's
<br>
bad. But I think it's better than it was five years
<br>
ago.&quot;
<br>
<p>Len Schlesinger, 48, an expert in customer service,
<br>
previously senior associate dean and a professor at
<br>
Harvard Business School, and now executive vice
<br>
president of The Limited Inc.: &quot;Let's see, we've gone
<br>
from 'meeting customer expectations,' to 'exceeding
<br>
customer expectations,' to 'delighting customers,' to
<br>
'customer ecstasy.' I hate to see what comes next.&quot;
<br>
<p>Patricia Seybold, 51, CEO of an e-business consulting
<br>
company and author of the optimistic book The Customer
<br>
Revolution: How to Thrive When Customers Are in
<br>
Control, which is due out this month: &quot;I agree that
<br>
customer service hasn't gotten better since the
<br>
Internet came along. It has gotten worse. But
<br>
companies are beginning to realize that we're very
<br>
angry at them. Companies that don't wake up and pay
<br>
attention to this are going to be out of business.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, we can only hope.
<br>
<p>Customer service is a notoriously slippery concept --
<br>
hard to define, apparently impossible to quantify. But
<br>
there is one guy who knows for sure what's happening
<br>
to customer service, because he measures it in 65,000
<br>
interviews a year with American customers.
<br>
<p>Claes Fornell, 53, is a professor at the University of
<br>
Michigan Business School and an expert on &quot;the
<br>
economics of customer satisfaction.&quot; Fornell is
<br>
creator and director of the American Customer
<br>
Satisfaction Index. The ACSI measures how content
<br>
Americans are with the goods and services that they
<br>
consume -- in the aggregate, and industry by industry,
<br>
company by company.
<br>
<p>Fornell names names! His online data is a carnival for
<br>
cranky consumers: You can click through and take glee
<br>
in the lame scores of all of the companies that you
<br>
love to hate.
<br>
<p>First Union, my bank, is down 10.5% in satisfaction
<br>
ratings since the index started in 1994.
<br>
<p>Wal-Mart, my source for diapers, paper towels, and
<br>
Tide, is down 10% since the index started and down 4%
<br>
in just the past year alone.
<br>
<p>Fornell conceived this herculean undertaking -- scores
<br>
are measured quarterly -- because he thought that the
<br>
U.S. economy was being severely mismeasured.  &quot;Eighty
<br>
percent of GDP is service now,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to
<br>
behave as though we live in a service economy.&quot;
<br>
<p>The ACSI measures the perceived quality of
<br>
U.S. economic output -- the experience of being a
<br>
consumer in the United States. In the past five years,
<br>
the ACSI is down from 73.7 to 72.9. But that number
<br>
includes everything from Whirlpool appliances to the
<br>
experience of shopping on Amazon.com.
<br>
<p>Here's the amazing thing: Every measured company in
<br>
the appliance, beer, car, clothing, food,
<br>
personal-care, shoe, and soft-drink industries is
<br>
above the national average. Even the cigarette
<br>
companies have above-average customer-satisfaction
<br>
ratings.
<br>
<p>Not so for airlines, banks, department stores,
<br>
fast-food outlets, hospitals, hotels, and phone
<br>
companies.
<br>
<p>It's the service that's bad.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh, I think we can say that for sure,&quot; says Fornell.
<br>
<p><p>The Hard Truth( s ) About Customer Service
<br>
<p>I didn't begin my journey through the service jungle
<br>
at Sprint PCS by accident, or because I think that the
<br>
company would be a good target for mockery. Sprint PCS
<br>
is a pure new-economy company. It offers nothing but
<br>
service -- and it's digital wireless service to
<br>
boot. The company's only product is moving voices
<br>
through the air. The first time that you could have
<br>
made a Sprint PCS call was December 1996.  From a
<br>
standing start, in four years, the company has grown
<br>
to 28,328 employees ( 10,000 in customer care ), 9.8
<br>
million customers, and annual revenues of roughly $6
<br>
billion. Sprint PCS signs up 10,000 new customers each
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>The company has access to every conceivable
<br>
technological helper: the Net, automated phone
<br>
services, and the most-sophisticated call centers. And
<br>
yet, my own experience dealing with Sprint PCS has
<br>
been consistently aggravating. In eight years of
<br>
having BellSouth provide our home phone service, I've
<br>
only had occasion to talk to them three or four
<br>
times. I've talked to Sprint PCS more than that since
<br>
Halloween -- always with unhappy results.
<br>
<p>Sprint PCS knows the right thing to do. It just can't
<br>
do it. Faerie Kizzire, 51, senior vice president for
<br>
Sprint PCS, is in charge of customer service for the
<br>
company.  She's a veteran: She spent nine years at
<br>
Sprint managing customer service for the long-distance
<br>
business, then managed customer service for a
<br>
health-insurance company, and was wooed back to Sprint
<br>
to create customer care for wireless.
<br>
<p>I tell her the story of a call I have just listened to
<br>
with Chad: Marlene in Ohio has had to call three times
<br>
just to get a credit for charges that shouldn't have
<br>
been on her bill in the first place. Before Chad, two
<br>
customer-care advocates dealt with Marlene by simply
<br>
telling her that she was wrong. As Chad discovers,
<br>
Marlene was in fact improperly charged. So why did
<br>
that happen? Why did two customer-service reps argue
<br>
with Marlene, rather than credit her? Why does Marlene
<br>
know more about her calling plan than customer care
<br>
does?
<br>
<p>Kizzire is disappointed. &quot;The complexity of the
<br>
product and the variations in the product can make
<br>
that kind of problem very difficult,&quot; she says. &quot;We do
<br>
see some of our people falling on the side of 'I'm
<br>
right' versus 'I'm going to make it right.' &quot;
<br>
<p>Sprint PCS looks as if it's doing all of the right
<br>
things. The company's training program for reps is 6
<br>
to 10 weeks long. Across the call center are
<br>
exhortations to good service: &quot;Did you dazzle your
<br>
customers today?&quot; Says Kizzire: &quot;It is true that
<br>
people who have a little bit of knowledge can be
<br>
dangerous. We always say, Don't try to dazzle the
<br>
customer with what you know. These days, many
<br>
customers have years of experience.&quot;
<br>
<p>And therein lies a clue to what's really happening to
<br>
customer service -- and why. The secret about customer
<br>
service in the new economy isn't that it's bad --
<br>
everyone knows it's bad. The secret is that it's
<br>
harder to deliver good customer service than ever
<br>
before. Why? Technology, especially in its early days,
<br>
is always hard. No surprise there. Why would we expect
<br>
companies that can't figure out how to run a phone
<br>
center -- talking to real people about problems in
<br>
their own business -- to be really good at using
<br>
advanced technology to automate the process of taking
<br>
care of us?
<br>
<p>And customers are more demanding. We want good
<br>
service, quickly. We don't wait at gas pumps, we're
<br>
antsy in ATM lines, and we pay to FedEx things to
<br>
avoid standing in line at the post office. Companies
<br>
have created, nursed, and benefited from this
<br>
impatience. We are victims of it in our own
<br>
lives. They are victims of it too. It makes providing
<br>
customer service brutally unforgiving.
<br>
<p>Technology has, in fact, made some things quicker and
<br>
easier, and it has allowed us to take care of
<br>
ourselves. I can plunge through the details of my
<br>
online bank statement more thoroughly in 50 seconds
<br>
than any automated voice-mail system could permit in
<br>
50 minutes, or than even the most patient phone
<br>
operator would tolerate. This means that when we talk
<br>
to someone in person, either things are really screwed
<br>
up, or we are really angry and want to share that
<br>
anger with a person. Or both. Technology has made the
<br>
actual person-to-person customer service of big
<br>
companies much more complicated and demanding.
<br>
<p>Despite all of the consultants, gurus, and outsource
<br>
providers, customer service is hard to deliver in a
<br>
mass economy. I wasn't on the phones at Sprint PCS for
<br>
more than a couple of hours, and I can see that the
<br>
real problem isn't customer service or even
<br>
culture. No, the real problem is more fundamental:
<br>
Sprint PCS offers a simple service that is really very
<br>
complicated. Best tip-off? It takes someone 15 minutes
<br>
to sell me a phone and a calling plan in a Sprint PCS
<br>
store. It takes Faerie Kizzire 6 weeks -- 240 hours --
<br>
to teach a phone rep to handle any problems that I
<br>
might have with that phone.
<br>
<p><p>Some Good News: What's the 411?
<br>
<p>My favorite example of new-economy meltdown is
<br>
directory assistance.  Directory assistance should be
<br>
the perfect new-economy product: It's just information
<br>
-- and simple information at that. There is an
<br>
existing way to bill customers, and, given the swift
<br>
accumulation of databases, directory assistance should
<br>
be getting better and better all the time.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's gotten so much worse,&quot; says customer-service
<br>
expert Patricia Seybold.  &quot;Now you get the wrong
<br>
number all the time.&quot;
<br>
<p>I've kept track during the past two months. Over
<br>
several dozen calls, directory assistance delivered
<br>
the wrong number about half of the time. Of course,
<br>
you get charged for the wrong numbers, just as you do
<br>
for the right numbers. If it's a long-distance number
<br>
and it's wrong, you pay for that phone call too. As if
<br>
that weren't enough, here's a moment of customer
<br>
delight: Call directory assistance and try to get a
<br>
credit for a wrong number.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, sir,&quot; says the abrupt operator. &quot;We don't
<br>
give credits.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We don't give credits, sir. You have to call your
<br>
local phone company. When your phone bill comes.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;At the end of the month?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Correct, sir. Is there a number you need?&quot;
<br>
<p>So now I've paid once for the wrong number and paid
<br>
again to be told that I have to call some other
<br>
company, some other time, to get my $2 back.
<br>
<p>Yet one company gives delightful directory assistance
<br>
-- polite, accurate, helpful.  It is none other than
<br>
... Sprint PCS. The contrast between cellular
<br>
directory and land-line directory is as dramatic as
<br>
the contrast between Sprint PCS directory and Sprint
<br>
PCS customer care. Ask Sprint PCS for a restaurant's
<br>
number, and they offer to make a reservation. Ask for
<br>
the number of a movie theater, and they offer to read
<br>
you not just the number but also the movies that are
<br>
playing at that theater, when they are playing, and
<br>
who is starring in each movie.
<br>
<p>Seybold was able to guess exactly what was going on
<br>
immediately. &quot;It's outsourced,&quot; she said.
<br>
<p>And so it is. Metro One Telecommunications, a small
<br>
company based in Beaverton, Oregon, handles directory
<br>
assistance for Sprint PCS -- and also for Nextel and
<br>
many regional cellular companies. The quality of Metro
<br>
One's service is no accident. As Seybold predicted,
<br>
that is exactly what it is selling to cellular
<br>
companies: good directory assistance.
<br>
<p>The economics are great for everyone: Even at what
<br>
feels like an unhurried pace, Metro One's operators
<br>
take 50 calls an hour ( including breaks, slow
<br>
periods, and training ), which brings in $50 an
<br>
hour. Half of that goes to Metro One, half is gravy to
<br>
Sprint PCS. Of the $25 an hour that Metro One gets,
<br>
operators start at some centers at $9 an hour in
<br>
straight salary -- before incentive pay or
<br>
benefits. Me, as a customer? I get the right number,
<br>
for about what BellSouth's wrong numbers cost me.
<br>
<p>Metro One has 29 deliberately small call centers: 200
<br>
operators or fewer, with 100 or fewer working at any
<br>
one time. The call center in Charlotte, North Carolina
<br>
is lean -- spartan compared to Sprint PCS's Fort Worth
<br>
center. But you can understand the entire place in a
<br>
single glance. Directory assistance, of course, is
<br>
child's play compared to helping people with their
<br>
cell-phones. But remember: Standard directory
<br>
assistance is abysmal.
<br>
<p>Heather McCuen, 23, started at Metro One in March
<br>
1999, and after nine months, she makes $12 an
<br>
hour. Calls cascade in on her like a waterfall. &quot;Leith
<br>
Mercedes.&quot;  &quot;Larry's Plant Farm.&quot; &quot;Start-to-Finish
<br>
Tattoo Shop.&quot; &quot;Just What the Doctor Ordered
<br>
Restaurant.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm amazed at what people name their businesses,&quot;
<br>
Heather says.
<br>
<p>In 11 minutes, she takes 17 calls -- 38.8 seconds a
<br>
call. Heather's style is efficient but deliberate. She
<br>
reads the number slowly to avoid having to repeat it.
<br>
<p>What is striking is how little it takes to make people
<br>
happy, how little it takes to get it right, and how
<br>
long 40 seconds really is. But what is also striking
<br>
is how hard it would be to automate this process. To
<br>
do it right doesn't require much, but it does require
<br>
a spark of human intelligence on both ends of the
<br>
transaction.
<br>
<p>Even in these brief encounters, the full range of
<br>
human character is on display.  &quot;I'm looking for
<br>
Shannon Pickering,&quot; says a man over a
<br>
characteristically crackly connection. The Charlotte
<br>
center serves mainly North Carolina and South
<br>
Carolina, so the operators are familiar with local
<br>
geography, but Heather and her colleagues can provide
<br>
numbers nationwide. Heather patiently searches a
<br>
couple of the towns that the man mentions, without
<br>
luck.
<br>
<p>&quot;I found someone's day planner in the middle of the
<br>
road,&quot; the man says. &quot;I'm just trying to return it to
<br>
her.&quot; Heather ups her intensity a notch. She broadens
<br>
her search to all of North Carolina, South Carolina,
<br>
and Virginia. She tries a variety of spellings for the
<br>
names. Heather tells the man what she is trying. She
<br>
is regretful.  The man is regretful. The call spills
<br>
past two minutes. No luck.
<br>
<p>Metro One's databases are updated with fresh numbers
<br>
in real time, all the time.  Operators can send along
<br>
complaints about wrong numbers. All kinds of searches
<br>
are available. I saw one operator find a particularly
<br>
elusive residential number by reading through a list
<br>
of every person who lived on a street.
<br>
<p>The Baby Bells shoot for directory calls lasting 17 to
<br>
20 seconds, total, compared to Metro One's 33-second
<br>
standard. That, of course, is the difference. And as
<br>
trivial as it may sound -- what's 15 seconds? --
<br>
companies know how to do the multiplication. At least,
<br>
they know how to do it when it's their 15 seconds.
<br>
<p>Metro One's Charlotte center handles roughly 275,000
<br>
calls a week. The math is easy. If each call lasts 33
<br>
seconds, as it does at Metro One, then 275,000 calls
<br>
require 2,520 hours of operator time. If each call
<br>
lasts 20 seconds, as it does at BellSouth, then
<br>
275,000 calls require only 1,528 hours of operator
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>It takes 50% more people to do it the Metro One
<br>
way. To do it right.
<br>
<p><p>Secrets of the Amazon: Customer Service as R&amp;D
<br>
<p>For all of its struggles -- with its balance sheet,
<br>
its stock, the union drive, and layoffs -- Amazon.com
<br>
has done one thing brilliantly: customer service. I
<br>
placed my first order with Amazon in 1997 and have
<br>
been a steady customer since. In four years of making
<br>
purchases for myself and for others, I've found what I
<br>
needed, ordered it, received a flurry of emails about
<br>
my orders, and then gotten either thank-you notes or
<br>
what I ordered. I've never had to contact Amazon about
<br>
any matter. I have had, in essence, no customer
<br>
service from Amazon. Put another way, I have had such
<br>
perfect customer service, the service itself has been
<br>
transparent. That is exactly what Amazon wants. The
<br>
goal is perfect customer service through no customer
<br>
service.
<br>
<p>In a very short time, Amazon has set a new standard
<br>
for customer service, and I went to Seattle to see
<br>
how. What I discovered is a place that regards
<br>
customer service as an R&amp;D lab -- a way not to help
<br>
customers, but to help the company.
<br>
<p>&quot;We want to make it easier and easier for our
<br>
customers to do business with us,&quot; says Bill Price,
<br>
50, vice president of global customer service for
<br>
Amazon. &quot;We want to have everything go so right, you
<br>
never have to contact us. To do that, we have to stay
<br>
tuned up. We have to keep asking, What are the
<br>
problems?&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, every customer-service VP in America, every
<br>
customer- service VP in history, would agree with
<br>
those sentiments. Two things make all the difference
<br>
at Amazon: the view the company takes of customer
<br>
service and customers, and the way the company is
<br>
organized to drive home that view.
<br>
<p>Amazon doesn't consider customer service to be the
<br>
complaint department, or even the quality-control and
<br>
customer-satisfaction department. Amazon considers
<br>
Bill Price's outfit to be a research lab for
<br>
discovering how to adjust and improve customer
<br>
service. And Amazon considers customer service to be
<br>
its core business. The company really offers nothing
<br>
but customer service.
<br>
<p>So every single encounter with a customer -- by phone,
<br>
by email, even by clicking on Web pages -- is
<br>
considered to be the source of potentially vital
<br>
information about the course of the entire company.
<br>
<p>How does that work?
<br>
<p>Well, to start with, the company tracks the reason for
<br>
every customer contact. It keeps a list of the top-ten
<br>
reasons why customers contact the company --
<br>
monitoring the list daily, weekly, monthly -- and it
<br>
is constantly working on ways to eliminate those
<br>
reasons.
<br>
<p>For years, the number-one question that people asked
<br>
Amazon was, Where's my stuff? Now, on every page,
<br>
starting with the welcome page, there's a box labeled,
<br>
&quot;Where's my stuff?&quot;
<br>
<p>Amazon's operations are so interwoven with
<br>
customer-driven changes that employees are briefly
<br>
baffled when you ask for examples.
<br>
<p>&quot;Two years ago,&quot; says Price, &quot;one common problem was,
<br>
'I want to buy five books, and ship them to my five
<br>
brothers, each at a separate address.' Our system was
<br>
originally set up so that one order had to go to one
<br>
address, forcing the customer, in a case like that, to
<br>
place five separate orders. Now we have a
<br>
'ship-to-multiple-addresses' function. And you don't
<br>
need to get in touch with us to figure it out.&quot;
<br>
<p>Shortly after its consumer-electronics store debuted,
<br>
Amazon was deluged with requests for a simple chart
<br>
that would compare the features and prices of similar
<br>
products, such as MP3 players and digital cameras. As
<br>
a result, Amazon has developed a product-by-product
<br>
&quot;comparison engine&quot; that does exactly that.
<br>
<p>Just last year, a customer sent an email pointing out
<br>
something that had bugged him for years: On the main
<br>
ordering page, customers are instructed to enter their
<br>
email address and their Amazon password. Next come two
<br>
options: &quot;Forgot your password? Click here&quot; and &quot;Sign
<br>
in using our secure server.&quot;
<br>
<p>Originally, the options were in that order. If someone
<br>
simply tabbed from option to option, he would click,
<br>
&quot;Forgot your password?&quot; -- even when what he wanted to
<br>
do was sign in. Because of that single, irritated
<br>
email, the ordering page was changed.
<br>
<p>Again, though, the head of customer service at any big
<br>
company could tick off customer suggestions that have
<br>
drifted up and changed products and operations.
<br>
<p>But at Amazon, the notion of customer service as R&amp;D
<br>
isn't a slogan, it's a structure -- an unavoidable
<br>
force to be reckoned with. Price's division includes a
<br>
group that does nothing but analyze and anticipate
<br>
problems and cook up solutions.  Indeed,
<br>
representatives from customer-service project
<br>
management sit on all launch teams as &quot;the voice of
<br>
the customer.&quot;
<br>
<p>The ethic cuts deeper than it would first appear. &quot;You
<br>
can have a great overall culture,&quot; says Price, &quot;with
<br>
real empathy for the customer and passion for fixing
<br>
the problems. You can have individual reps who say,
<br>
'This customer is really upset, and I have to deal
<br>
with it.' I think we do that.
<br>
<p>&quot;What's missing almost everywhere else is, even if you
<br>
have the empathy and the passion and you address the
<br>
customer's problem, you haven't really given good
<br>
customer service in total. You haven't done that until
<br>
you have eliminated the problem that caused her to
<br>
call in the first place.&quot; Exactly.
<br>
<p>It is, frankly, easy to be skeptical of all of
<br>
this. For such a strategy to work, the entire company
<br>
has to bend to it. One incident ( of many that I
<br>
encountered ) shows how deeply ingrained the attitude
<br>
is.
<br>
<p>The problem materialized during the 1999 Christmas
<br>
season, the first Christmas that Amazon sold
<br>
toys. Almost as soon as the selling season began, the
<br>
company received complaints that were notable more for
<br>
the level of outrage than for the actual number of
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>Some toys were big enough to be shipped in their
<br>
original packing boxes. &quot;They were arriving on
<br>
people's doorsteps, and the people called and said,
<br>
'Hey, we weren't expecting this to look like a Big
<br>
Wheel. My kid came home from school and found his
<br>
present! Now I gotta buy another one!' &quot; says Janet
<br>
Savage, 31, who was a customer-service manager that
<br>
Christmas. This quickly became known as the Big Wheel
<br>
problem, and it was Savage's job to resolve it.
<br>
<p>It was an interesting moment. One possible response --
<br>
a perfectly reasonable response -- would be to start
<br>
warning customers about items shipped in original
<br>
cartons. After all, if you buy something at Toys 'R'
<br>
Us, you don't complain that it comes wrapped as what
<br>
it is.
<br>
<p>That response was never considered at Amazon. Savage
<br>
simply started looking for durable, inexpensive
<br>
wrapping material that would be available immediately
<br>
and in large quantities. &quot;Our customers were not
<br>
happy,&quot; says Savage. &quot;It was not acceptable to tell
<br>
parents, Oh well, too bad.&quot;
<br>
<p>She found rolls of plastic material like the type used
<br>
in big garbage bags, and Amazon started overwrapping
<br>
every large toy and a selection of electronics items
<br>
that were likely to be Christmas gifts. How urgent was
<br>
it? &quot;I bugged people about it on an hourly basis until
<br>
we got it resolved,&quot; says Savage. &quot;You're either Santa
<br>
Claus or you're not.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Great Service: Back to the Future
<br>
<p>I have a running argument with customer-service
<br>
experts that may be mostly an argument on my side. It
<br>
is neatly summed up by One to One guru Don Peppers. He
<br>
offers two key points about service. First, &quot;Service
<br>
is bad because it's hard to do.&quot;  Second, &quot;The secret
<br>
to good service, really, is to treat your customer
<br>
like you'd like to be treated yourself.&quot; Somewhere
<br>
between point one and point two, I missed the hard
<br>
part.
<br>
<p>The hard part is not the service. The hard part is
<br>
everything but the service. The hard part is how
<br>
companies think about what they are doing and how they
<br>
behave as a result. Why is the service of airlines so
<br>
bad? Simple: Airlines don't think of themselves as
<br>
service organizations. Airlines think of themselves as
<br>
factories that manufacture revenue-seat
<br>
miles. Airlines have been tuned in to the efficiency
<br>
of their manufacturing operations, not to the quality
<br>
of the journey that they provide.
<br>
<p>When you spend weeks talking to people about customer
<br>
service, when you visit people who do it as their
<br>
livelihood, it is easy to become consumed with the
<br>
challenges, the technology, and the measurements that
<br>
obsess the world of customer service.
<br>
<p>How much cheaper is it to deliver balances by
<br>
automated phone menu than through a service rep? How
<br>
much cheaper is it to deliver balances on the Web than
<br>
over the telephone? What do people want to talk to a
<br>
person about? What do they want to do themselves?
<br>
<p>How do you create customer satisfaction, customer
<br>
delight, and customer ecstasy? Most of those questions
<br>
miss the larger point.
<br>
<p>Dan Leemon, 47, chief strategy officer for Charles
<br>
Schwab, understands this dilemma clearly. Charles
<br>
Schwab is a brokerage firm, of course. It keeps money
<br>
for people, has custody of stock certificates, and
<br>
functions as a bank in many ways.  But like Sprint PCS
<br>
or directory assistance, Schwab is really a pure
<br>
customer-service organization. Its specialty is
<br>
financial-services customer service -- but it's
<br>
service all the same. Everything else is record
<br>
keeping.
<br>
<p>&quot;A lot of companies fall into the trap,&quot; says Leemon,
<br>
&quot;of believing that some new customer-service
<br>
technology will take cost and management burden away
<br>
and will eliminate the need to have very talented
<br>
people on the phones and in their retail outlets.
<br>
<p>&quot;That has actually never been true,&quot; he says. Indeed,
<br>
the complex demands of customers have increased the
<br>
length of the typical call to Schwab by 75% during the
<br>
past five years.
<br>
<p>One old-economy sector that is justifiably famous for
<br>
service is the cruise industry. The high-end cruise
<br>
lines achieve this by offering training, incentives,
<br>
and quality facilities. One thing that they do
<br>
particularly well is suck up customer feedback.
<br>
<p>Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines ( RCCL ), for instance,
<br>
has 22 ships. When a ship docks at home port at 7 AM,
<br>
before it clears customs, someone from RCCL has
<br>
boarded to retrieve the customer-comment cards
<br>
distributed to every cabin. The ratings are tabulated,
<br>
the written comments are transcribed, and the results
<br>
are returned to the ship's managers before the ship
<br>
sails again at 5 PM.
<br>
<p>So before the next cruise begins, RCCL's captains,
<br>
dining-room managers, housekeepers, and entertainers
<br>
know how the previous cruise went -- from praise to
<br>
serious problems. Imagine what flying the big airlines
<br>
would be like if you got a comment card at the end of
<br>
each flight -- and the company acted on what it
<br>
learned.
<br>
<p>But here's the really interesting piece of the RCCL
<br>
story. With computers, it's easy enough to tabulate
<br>
comment-card results now in a single workday. But in
<br>
1971, when RCCL had just one ship and no computers,
<br>
the process was the same.  Cards were tabulated by
<br>
hand the day the ship came in, and the comments were
<br>
typed ( four carbons ) and delivered back to the ship
<br>
before it sailed again in the afternoon.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, what is so striking about the
<br>
customer-service revolution that we are digging our
<br>
way through is how little a century of technological
<br>
innovation really changes what matters.
