</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I mustn't let the simulation discussion end without mentioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the _ST: TNG_ episode &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot;, written by Rene Eschevarria
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and starring Daniel Davis (who also portrays Niles the butler in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the television show _The Nanny_) as Professor Moriarty.

<p>I can think of two others but not their titles;
<br>
<p>The first was in the final series of TNG if memory serves, where Riker 
<br>
flicks back and forth between a high tech &quot;prison&quot; and a theatre piece he 
<br>
is acting in on the Enterprise.  Of course, the play he is in looks exactly 
<br>
like the cell he's stuck in.
<br>
<p>The other was in Deep Space 9, where Chief O'Brien finds himself in cramped 
<br>
prison, where the only way to pass the time is to create intricate patterns 
<br>
in the sand on the floor of his cell, tutored by his cellmate (whom he 
<br>
eventually kills, believing he witheld food).  After years of this, and the 
<br>
accompanying guilt over the murder, he suddenly finds himself back in 
<br>
reality, where he finds out that it was all in his mind, the method of 
<br>
&quot;punishment&quot; used by a civilization whose rules he broke while 
<br>
visiting.  What seemed to him like years took only hours.
<br>
<p>James....
<br>
<p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
<br>
