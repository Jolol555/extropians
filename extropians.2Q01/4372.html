</em><br>
<p>Reminds me of good old Ben Franklin, who wrote in his autobiography:
<br>
<p>&quot;(blockquote &quot;
<br>
I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments of
<br>
others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
<br>
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion,
<br>
such as &quot;certainly&quot;, &quot;undoubtedly&quot;, etc.   I adopted instead of them &quot;I
<br>
conceive&quot;, &quot;I apprehend&quot;, or &quot;I imagine&quot; a thing to be so or so; or &quot;so it
<br>
appears to me at present&quot;.
<br>
<p>When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the
<br>
pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some
<br>
absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in
<br>
certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present
<br>
case there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.
<br>
<p>I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I
<br>
engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my
<br>
opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had
<br>
less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
<br>
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
<br>
happened to be in the right.
<br>
&quot;)&quot;
<br>
<p>NB: Yay, it's a LISP markup language. Down with SGML, HTML and XML!
<br>
Oops, I meant, &quot;I apprehend that markup languages based on &lt;tags&gt;
<br>
might not be as much of a progress as generally believed they are,
<br>
considering that LISP had SEX long ago (*), that seems to me like
<br>
they already provide at least some of the structural power of SGML,
<br>
and maybe much more -- so it appears to me at the moment.&quot;
<br>
Or maybe I really meant &quot;{SG,HT,X}ML *SUCK*!&quot;, after all (hi, Curl!).
<br>
<p>(*) and still has it -- must be tantric.
<br>
<p><p>Well, I happen to know a few living persons who are as good as
<br>
that dead Benji fellow, but I admit my puny attempts to emulate them
<br>
failed miserably. I suppose it's both a matter of temperament,
<br>
and one of the milieu in which you were raised, and how the debates
<br>
you took place in or were faced with were framed when you were young,
<br>
at which point I have said a tautology: &quot;yay, there are both
<br>
inborn and acquired factors&quot; -- doh! Of course, as transhumanists,
<br>
I suppose some of you think this is something that can be amended
<br>
by suitable self-modification techniques, at which point I'm interested
<br>
in hearing about what are these techniques and how to use them.
<br>
<p>Another question raised by such considerations is that of the functions
<br>
of expression in general and through email conversation in particular.
<br>
Who are we writing for?
<br>
* Is it just for ourselves, readers not withstanding?
<br>
* Is it for those who dare and accept to reply to us?
<br>
* Or are we writing for the silent mass of readers? (And goddess knows
<br>
&nbsp;most readers don't write -- I know it because I met her, and she sets
<br>
&nbsp;an example.)
<br>
And maybe more pertinently, WHAT are we writing for?
<br>
* Is it just as an irrepressible urge?
<br>
* Is it a way to induce an emotional effect?
<br>
* or a way to build theories?
<br>
<p>Now, you can combine mostly combine the WHO and the WHAT:
<br>
** Are we just letting words out without any specific purpose,
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;expressing ourselves in a conversational way&quot;, as was argued,
<br>
&nbsp;just like we breath or piss?
<br>
** Are we trying to affirm our personality in some territory,
<br>
&nbsp;looking for reinforcing (positive or negative) signals that help
<br>
&nbsp;us define our own position?
<br>
** Are we fulfilling an urge to tell something we think should be said
<br>
&nbsp;by someone, somewhere, since noone else since to be doing it, we ought
<br>
&nbsp;to be that person? (why are you suddenly staring at me?)
<br>
** Are we trying to satisfy our self-esteem by proving ourselves
<br>
&nbsp;how we can write such cool messages?
<br>
** Are we trying to induce some well-being or unease or more specific
<br>
&nbsp;emotion in specific people, or otherwise trolling for some reaction?
<br>
** Are we trying to spread our practical memes,
<br>
&nbsp;leading people to act in some way? [Let's all fight the CoS!]
<br>
** Are we trying to crystallize our thoughts by going through
<br>
&nbsp;the constraining process of writing them into a coherent message?
<br>
** Are we trying to gather argumentive information from other people,
<br>
&nbsp;so as to enhance our model of the world.
<br>
** Are we trying to disseminate higher memes,
<br>
&nbsp;that constitute our view of the world?
<br>
<p>Of course, a same message can have several of these functions (and more)
<br>
at once. Actually, these &quot;functions&quot; are more like analytic points of view
<br>
we can have on a message than actual synthetic mecanisms that lead to the
<br>
message being emitted. Although I'd be very much interested in hearing
<br>
some AI guru discuss how his purported AI's communications can be analyzed
<br>
through this grill, and what underlying synthetic mecanisms can be
<br>
identified.
<br>
<p>Enough rant for today. See the mindflow, from politeness to AI,
<br>
through LISP, sex, self-modification, the functions of language,
<br>
and ending with recapitulation?
