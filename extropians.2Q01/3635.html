<em>&gt; * Relationships and sex -- In some parts of the world, about 50% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriages fail. Some human couples (and their families) &quot;fight like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cats and dogs.&quot; (Maybe the &quot;marriage&quot; meme has become an error
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- particularly considering the risk of having to pay for alimony and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child-support, in case of divorce!)

<br>
<p>Marriage, Bubonic Plague, And Infected Warts
<br>
If You Have A Choice, Go With The Warts
<br>
By  Fred Reed
<br>
<p>If I could offer a young man one piece of sage advice, it would be this:
<br>
<p>Don't get married.
<br>
<p>Don't do it. Come the divorce, as come it probably will, the courts will
<br>
systematically shear you of your children, your house, and huge amounts of
<br>
your income for twenty years. Don't do it. It isn't worth it. Nothing is.
<br>
<p>My saying this usually brings, from women, cries that I'm an extremist or
<br>
woman-hater. No. The problem is not women, but the courts. Men can behave
<br>
every bit as reprehensibly as women, though they go about it differently. But
<br>
the judicial system, which is politicized to the gills, utterly favors women
<br>
over men in divorce cases, without remorse, decency, or concern for children.
<br>
<p>Should you doubt this, read, before you pop the most foolish of questions,
<br>
<em>&gt;From Courtship to Courthouse by the divorce lawyer Jed Abraham.*
</em><br>
<p>Writes Abraham, &quot;If you're like most men, you're married, or you hope to marry
<br>
some day. You think you deserve to live happily ever after, but if things
<br>
don't work out that way, you'll get a civilized divorce and move on. You'll
<br>
stay pals with your ex, and you'll see your kids as often as you want.
<br>
<p>&quot;You have no idea what you're getting into.&quot;
<br>
<p>And you don't. Not the faintest freaking clue.
<br>
<p>A few facts from Abraham:
<br>
<p>&quot;The odds are 50% that your marriage will end in divorce. The odds are 70%
<br>
that your divorce will be filed by your wife. The odds are 80% that your wife
<br>
will get custody of your children-plus child support, alimony, and/or a hefty
<br>
chunk of your property.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is how it is.
<br>
<p>Yes, I know: You don't think this applies to you. Cup Cake loves you. She
<br>
would never behave in such a way. Think again. You have no conception of the
<br>
hatred that divorce engenders. Men are callous; women are mean. When a family
<br>
breaks up, when a life dreamed of disappears in flames and emotions go limbic,
<br>
women are not the kinder sex, and certainly not the more rational. And Cup
<br>
Cake will have the absolute upper hand, with the full power of the state to
<br>
help her express her dissatisfaction with you.
<br>
<p>Abraham: &quot;If your wages are not withheld and you fail to pay your child
<br>
support, the State will garnish your pay, slap liens on your property,
<br>
intercept your tax refunds, report you to credit agencies, discontinue your
<br>
driver's license, suspend your professional and business permits, hold you in
<br>
contempt of court, put your face on a wanted poster, throw you in jail, and
<br>
deny you food stamps. But if your ex doesn't spend that very same support on
<br>
the children, the State will do. . . nothing.&quot;
<br>
<p>It gets worse. There is, for example, &quot;imputed income.&quot; This means that your
<br>
child support will be based not on what your children need, not on what you
<br>
earn, but on what the court decides you could earn.
<br>
<p>Don't do it.
<br>
<p>If you love Cup Cake, live with her. Be kind to her. Be loyal to her. She may
<br>
be as nice as you think she is: Many women are. Buy her roses. Just don't
<br>
marry her, or have children with her. If the laws were even-handed, marriage
<br>
would be an admirable institution. The laws aren't equal.
<br>
<p>But it's the kids she'll use, should things get nasty, to tear your guts out.
<br>
If you're sure that Cup Cake won't do this, you're crazy. True, she may not.
<br>
Not all women do, or not to the same degree. But you won't know until it's too
<br>
late. And the courts will do anything she wants.
<br>
<p>Abraham: &quot;Your ex will warm to calling all the shots. She may cancel your
<br>
visitation now and then. If she's truly mean-spirited, she'll go much further.
<br>
Under the cover of her court-appointed role as sole custodian, she'll
<br>
systematically sever your relationship with the children. She'll badmouth you
<br>
to them. She'll schedule their extracurricular activities during your
<br>
visitation time. For good measure, she may accuse you of domestic violence and
<br>
child abuse.&quot;
<br>
<p>Think &quot;joint custody&quot; is the answer? The courts won't enforce it. What are you
<br>
going to do-sue Mommy? The kids will hate you for it. Do you believe in
<br>
pre-nups? The courts ignore them. Read Abraham. It's all there.
<br>
<p>Then, says Abraham, there's the killer: &quot;More efficiently, your ex may simply
<br>
move with the children to a distant community, with the law's acquiescence.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kids are the crunch, guys. They hurt. And she will know it, and use it. The
<br>
courts will help her. At bottom, the position of the courts is that the
<br>
children are her property, like furniture. Judges don't care about you at all.
<br>
<p>Ever drive away from what used to be your home, with your daughter of four
<br>
streaking across the parking lot, yelling, &quot;Daddy! Daddy! Please come
<br>
back!&quot;-and you can't?
<br>
<p>Ever have your little girl of four say, &quot;Daddy, can I get my birthday present
<br>
early?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Why, Pumpkin?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well. . . after the divorce we might move, and I won't see you again.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's what you are in for, guys. Don't do it. You'll be suicidally depressed,
<br>
miss your kids to the point of desperation, be almost frantic-and the courts
<br>
will make sure you can do nothing about it. The ex will probably enjoy it.
<br>
<p>That's the reality. Don't believe it? Talk to men who have been there.
<br>
<p>Why do women do these things? Not because they're evil. Cup Cake is probably a
<br>
perfectly decent woman in her dealing with the rest of the earth. She'll do it
<br>
because she hates you, which is the normal outcome of a divorce. She'll do it
<br>
because she can. She's furious because the marriage didn't work, which will be
<br>
entirely your fault.
<br>
<p>And the law gives her every incentive: She will get the house, the kids, the
<br>
child support-and she knows she will. If women knew they had an even chance of
<br>
not getting custody, of having to pay child support, the divorce rate would
<br>
drop like a prom dress and joint custody would suddenly mean joint custody.
<br>
Women love their children as much as men do.
<br>
<p>But that's not how it is. The courts encourage divorce, and they rape men. Get
<br>
used to it.
<br>
<p>Abraham: &quot;The odds are it doesn't pay for you to marry and have kids.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's a fact, guys. Think about it.
