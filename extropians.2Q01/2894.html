To me, it sounds like the close approach of the fighter killed the wing's 
<br>
lift, causing
<br>
the EP-3 to roll and hit the fighter.  That would make both surviving pilots' 
<br>
claims
<br>
to be essentially true - the American was flying straight and level, the EP-3 
<br>
turned
<br>
and hit the fighter.  I agree the &quot;at-fault&quot; party for the accident was the 
<br>
fighter pilot.
