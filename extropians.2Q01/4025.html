<p>It seems to be a fact, that money is quite valuable NOW.
<br>
I did not discuss about its value after the singularity.
<br>
(Anyway, Ray Kurzweil predicts (in the &quot;Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;)
<br>
serious deflation for this century.)

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I also heard of &quot;CARPE DIEM&quot; and &quot;NO RISK, NO FUN&quot; :)

</em><br>
<p>I am not quite sure which organizations accalerate and which ones 
<br>
postpone the singularity...;) 
<br>
<p>Even if I were sure, it is highly unprobable that my money would
<br>
accelerate the coming of singularity so much that the probability
<br>
increase of being alive at the time of the singularity would pay off.
<br>
<p>I think it is a reasonable decision the spare that money.
<br>
Even if the singularity comes soon, it may be that the eternal life
<br>
won't be cheap.
<br>
<p>Imagine: you signed up for Cryonics. The singularity is here.
<br>
You have signed up for cryonics. And you can't buy eternal life
<br>
lacking of money. You must take your bath instead and wait that
<br>
somebody revives you as a charity act. Your only solace is that the
<br>
technics of cryonics is &quot;nearly&quot; perfect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact is, no one can be that certain. You have to have a backup plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just in case.
</em><br>
<p>If the probability that this backup plan works is neglectible 
<br>
in comparison to being alive at the time of singularity, then it
<br>
is not worth paying for. That's what my matrix says.

</em><br>
<p>I don't know where your numbers come from. The commonsense of the 
<br>
decision is highly dependent on them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if this isn't so, I don't see why anyone would want to be reanimated

<p>By a friendly one, of course... :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Remember, you can only be reanimated once - any information lost

<p>The second part of the statement seems to be true...
