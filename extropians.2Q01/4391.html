<p><em>&gt;The studies undermine hopes that the 100 or so victims to date of variant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (vCJD) only succumbed to the disease because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freak variations in one key gene.
</em><br>
<p>That's a straw man. 1/3 of the population carries the gene in question.
<br>
Only 100 of ~ 20,000,000 susceptible English has gotten it, and the 
<br>
incidence curve has leveled off.  Even if the whole population started
<br>
catching it like the susceptibles, risks would be well below societally 
<br>
catastrophic - 1 in a few thousand, tops.  Enough to justify personal concern,
<br>
but no panic.  Naturally people working on vCJD have an incentive to
<br>
magnify the risks of vCJD (not to dismiss the valid level of concern
<br>
with vCJD)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The new work suggests the time it takes to develop the disease might depend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a combination of several genes, not just one. This means that far greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers of us could be &quot;incubating&quot; the disease, but have yet to show 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;symptoms.
</em><br>
<p>Greater, perhaps, but the idea of &quot;most&quot; doesn't fly.  Prion diseases have a 
<br>
definite dosage requirement to catch them at all*.  It is, of course, possible
<br>
that humans are unusually susceptible to catching BSE and unusually slow
<br>
to develop it; but that remains a low probability event.
<br>
<p>*Technically it appears each prion molecules has a very low chance of xmitting
<br>
disease and a very high chance of leaving the target completely unaffected.
<br>
Any given dose has a probability of not affecting the target, period.
<br>
You need a reasonably high titer to have a significant chance of catching the
<br>
disease.  For x-species transmission by oral routes the titers are very high.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, does anyone know if the prion disease will continue to ravage the brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even when submerged in LN2 (or at the proposed, somewhat warmer storage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions)?
</em><br>
<p>No ongoing effects.  The prion proteins have to move around to encounter the
<br>
normal ones and convert them.  At all proposed storage temperatures, 
<br>
everything is hard-frozen and nothing's going anywhere.
