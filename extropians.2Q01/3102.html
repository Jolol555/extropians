I feel woefully inadequate to the foreseeable challenges. On good days, I seek to become a better learner of facts,
<br>
skills _and_ of other people. Sorry that that doesn't directly address your question, but it's what I'm working on
<br>
myself, as I say, on good days. Mr. Bokov had some things he recommended for accelerating learning of the
<br>
fact-memorization and text-reading kinds.
<br>
<p>I'm not so sure there would be a whole lot of people on this list that would take on the responsibility of a total
<br>
makeover. I think I'd be suspicious of anyone willing to provide one. :) Then again, on _bad_ days... :)

<p>Getting stuck in &quot;gumption traps&quot;. That's a thing I'd like to help build a public set of resources for. Such traps are
<br>
tricky because most of them are not perceived as anything other than &quot;the way [things are] [the universe is]&quot;. They are
<br>
also tricky if they're frequently-reinforced learnings.
<br>
<p>But I'm not strictly an extropian. I just post here.
