<em>&gt;&gt; In the first place, you don't seem to understand the scope

<em>&gt;Sure.  But being unable to afford the eternal life afforded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pre-(Singularity-in-the-strong-sense) technology is a very real

</em><br>
<p>I think that I understand what you are saying.  You're saying
<br>
that some non-cryonic life extension capabilities that might
<br>
be available pre-Singularity might be pricey.
<br>
<p>Yes, that's true.  I hope that they also, like Cryonics, cost
<br>
just a few dollars a day.  My mother is on social security in
<br>
the U.S.  She collects more than 20 dollars per day.  I dare
<br>
say that in the U.S. and quite a number of countries, people
<br>
won't have a problem funding both cryonics and the life
<br>
extension capabilities that I think you are referring to.
<br>
<p>We must not forget the point that Ann Marie Tobias made in 
<br>
this thread a while ago, namely, that most of the resources
<br>
targeted for cryonic suspension---i.e., life insurance 
<br>
premiums---are eventually convertable into resources that
<br>
could be used for other eventualities.
<br>
<p>Your remark gains its greatest saliency when we consider that
<br>
the cost of certain life extension techniques might be dear.
<br>
This will provide difficult tradeoffs in more than just the
<br>
one way that you bring up.
