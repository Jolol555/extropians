</em><br>
<p>I'm surprised you say that; your paper seems to come down pretty hard
<br>
against the assumption that people seek the truth, in the title and
<br>
in most of the last part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;One thing which is unclear in the paper is how you should react if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;become convinced that both you and the other party are both rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and fully informed about these results.  ... As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;practical matter, what means do you apply to resolve your disagreement?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you sure you were both so rational and informed, you would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely sure that any apparent disagreement was not actually one -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was just a random fluctuation that looked like disagreement.
</em><br>
<p>I've been reading some of the papers in your references, and the way
<br>
I see it now is that there is a process which must occur in order for
<br>
everyone to be mutually informed about each other's beliefs.  If the
<br>
parties state their beliefs for the first tiem and they don't match,
<br>
that is fully compatible with the theorem.  It just means that they have
<br>
different information.
<br>
<p>However they are not yet fully mutually informed after this exchange,
<br>
because one or both of them may have or will have updated their internal
<br>
models based on this information.  The paper &quot;We Can't Disagree Forever&quot;
<br>
describes contrived scenarios where the two parties can just shout
<br>
their differing beliefs at each other N times, then suddenly at time
<br>
N+1 they both agree.  This is fully rational because each exchange
<br>
actually updates the internal model of what the other person knows,
<br>
and the models are gradually converging even though the stated opinions
<br>
don't change until the end.
<br>
<p>When I was asking about disagreement above, I was talking about the
<br>
initial stage in this process, when you first discover that you have
<br>
different posterior beliefs.  What is the best approach to resolve
<br>
the dispute?  The methods I have seen so far (as in the paper above)
<br>
are quite impractical for human beings to apply IMO as they seem to
<br>
require excessively detailed knowledge about the state of the world.
<br>
<p>I have come up with a more straightforward plan, which is, if both parties
<br>
are sincere and honest, for each party to estimate the confidence level he
<br>
has in the accuracy of his belief.  He would also need to keep statistics
<br>
about how often he has been right in the past on other beliefs where he
<br>
had this same subjective level of confidence.  Based on this the parties
<br>
can come up with a probability that each is right, and choose the belief
<br>
with the higher probability.  (Or perhaps they should choose the belief
<br>
which maximizes their joint probability, something along those lines.)
<br>
<p>As a rough rule of thumb, you might just accept the belief of the player
<br>
with the higher Idea Futures score, or better, use a subscore which is
<br>
based just on claims similar to the question at hand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;... Seemingly this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mean that if Bayesians John and Mary gradually move closer to an eventual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;compromise that they agree upon, this violates the theorem because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;could have predicted this path.  Yet it seems obvious that something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;like this must be how agreement is reached.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is far from obvious to me.  Any formal model of Bayesians exchanging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, for example, is not like this.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the Geanakoplos paper above also didn't work in this way which was
<br>
intuitive to me, so I guess it is not really how things would go.
