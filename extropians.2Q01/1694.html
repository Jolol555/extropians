<p><em>&gt; I think this came from Hungary. (an &quot;.hu&quot; email address). Pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compelling argument!  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>OK, analysing something like this is in itself an exercise in
<br>
silliness or too much seriousness. But I think it reveals something
<br>
about the memes we have to struggle against, and I am a tired swede
<br>
for the moment :-). The core of the confused mail seems to be that 1)
<br>
being a cyborg is not fun, 2) extropianism seeks to turn everybody
<br>
into cyborgs.
<br>
<p>1 is of course open to argument, but I think we can make a pretty good
<br>
case based on our views of self-enhancement, living
<br>
designed/deliberate lives and individual growth that at least some
<br>
people will find being a cyborg great. This goes against the
<br>
&quot;humanism&quot; often expressed that there is something particularly good
<br>
about the current human condition.
<br>
<p>2 is based on the common view that any ideology has to prescribe
<br>
behavior for not just its adherents but everyone else too. While we
<br>
might have views on universal principles, I don't think any currently
<br>
existing branch of transhumanism seriously proposes imposing itself on
<br>
non-transhumanists (it would go very deeply against the same
<br>
individual autonomy and freedom that transhumanism tries to
<br>
enhance). It is basically the classical liberal view that there is a
<br>
private morality for everyone; after we have settled on the public
<br>
morality needed to keep our societies working it should not be
<br>
extended into the private moral sphere. But many people are so used to
<br>
ideologies claiming the right to regulate everything and everyone,
<br>
that they have a hard time recognising just how tolerant transhumanism
<br>
is.
