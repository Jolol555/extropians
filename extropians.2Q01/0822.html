<p>How do you know it's computationally wasteful? How do you know there's stuff
<br>
there when you're not looking?
<br>
<p>Remind me, where did your imprinting of &quot;expensive &quot;come from? From your

past life? Which you were living, where? *Do* you think that's air you're

breathing?
<br>
<p>I'm ready to believe in a simulated universe, in a digital physics sense (while
<br>
we were speaking computationally wasteful, this is about as insane as it gets).
<br>
However, a TOE is just a description. It says nothing about the implementation
<br>
layer. The implementation layer is purely transcendental, unknowable. It is only
<br>
accessible, if it is meant to be accessible, which requires achitect's intent.
<br>
Occam sez: I will cut you. We're not a simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; magic physics.  I can't disprove it any more than I can disprove an abstract
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Assuming we're a simulation without evidence is ridiculous, but if we're 
<br>
being patently ridiculous, let's at least do it in style. No need to impose
<br>
ad hoc constraints.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, some people on this thread were proposing future SI's would sim us.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think they would be able to afford to (if they still bow to Darwin), 
<br>
even if some of them were motivated, for whatever perverse reasons. Assuming 
<br>
that our universe is their universe, of course. Hey say, that's a lot of
<br>
assumptions. Whizz, there goes that razor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not by us, certainly.  The argument that we should consider ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations since there will be umpteen futures sims doesn't hold water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if ditching heisenburg is required.  And, of course, Heisenburg appears
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the argument does hold water, but not for the reasons
<br>
you mention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; very much unditched in our universe.
</em><br>
<p>What direct sensoric evidence do you have right now that the Heisenberg
<br>
inequality is for real?
