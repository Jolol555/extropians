<p>
Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>I have viewed The Alcor Adventure video six times so far and now feel ready 
<br>
to discuss it.  An excellent investment at $25 considering how it would be 
<br>
an excellent primer to show curious friends and family.  I hope everyone on 
<br>
this list purchases a copy from Alcor!
<br>
<p>Having read the article in Cryonics by the video's creator Billy Seidel, I 
<br>
knew it was quite a challenge for him in deciding on the right approach as 
<br>
well as viewing length.  We all owe him a debt of gratitude for his hard 
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>As the video progresses, Billy Seidel walks the viewers through the process 
<br>
of considering cryonics in the various ways one must(price, odds of working, 
<br>
ethics/religion, what experts say, which org to join(oddly it wasn't CI or 
<br>
ACS lol!) and then a &quot;signing up&quot; is done at the end.  In this way many of 
<br>
the questions and objections a curious newcomer might have would be answered 
<br>
and a feeling of resolution would be reached.
<br>
<p>He does this all in a very systematic way as in one scene we see him check 
<br>
off the following...
<br>
good idea? yes
<br>
can I afford it? yes
<br>
is my religion ok with it? yes
<br>
have recent technological advancements made cryostasis even more possible? 
<br>
yes
<br>
<p>The video starts out with a view of Billy's hands at a desk with him as the 
<br>
narrator(not Charleton Heston or Patrick Stewart! lol)  He starts out with, 
<br>
&quot;this is going to be difficult, because what I'm thinking about may not even 
<br>
be possible at all.&quot;  I was surprised by his candor in starting out.
<br>
<p>He explains with a chart he draws how someone born this year may never die 
<br>
from disease or old age but those older(us!) will need something to get us 
<br>
over the hump.  If we can only make it to the time a hundred-years hence 
<br>
when medical technology is so advanced that what kills us now won't kill us 
<br>
then.  As Billy puts it &quot;so, the big problem is getting to the future!,&quot; and 
<br>
he then states &quot;Alcor says they can do it with biostasis.&quot;  Finally, he 
<br>
declares &quot;I'd better give them a call.&quot;  And the adventure begins...
<br>
<p>He reviews some reports and graphs done by various people to show we do have 
<br>
some chance of making it via cryonics despite the hazards of things such as 
<br>
fire or natural disaster.
<br>
<p>Max More is the first person interviewed(very briefly!).  Max very matter of 
<br>
factly explained how a sensible person should carefully study the matter and 
<br>
then make a decision.  Max admits there is no guarantee but as science 
<br>
progresses things look tremendously better that cryonics will work.  He gave 
<br>
an example of how many cells and tissues can now be frozen and then brought 
<br>
back.
<br>
<p>The graphic at the bottom of the screen introduced him as a philosopher.  
<br>
While, he is this by education I would think &quot;president of the Extropian 
<br>
Institute&quot; and/or &quot;business consultant&quot; could have also been good titles.  
<br>
Maybe, he just wears to many hats to label with just one like many people 
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>Natasha Vita-More is next up.  I especially liked how she explained cryonics 
<br>
should be seen as a form of insurance and the ultimate safety net.  Natasha 
<br>
shot down the notion that cryonicists are &quot;thrilled&quot; in some fetish-like way 
<br>
at the idea of being frozen.  So, I guess I'm the only one then! LOL!
<br>
<p>Natasha's graphic for her career was &quot;metaculture.&quot; My mother wanted to know 
<br>
exactly what a metaculturist does! lol  I thought maybe &quot;artist&quot; and/or 
<br>
&quot;media personality&quot; would have been better for people to understand.
<br>
<p>Natasha is such an attractive woman but the lighting was bad for the 
<br>
interview.  Her eyes were dark holes due to shadows which really bothered 
<br>
me.  I wish more attention had been paid to lighting.  I realize Billy 
<br>
Seidel had limited time and resources, but still.
<br>
<p>Rudi Hoffman, our resident financial pro, shared that cryonics is not just 
<br>
for the wealthy because of the incredible leverage one can get with life 
<br>
insurance.  How did I just know that Rudi would bring that up? I loved how 
<br>
on his shirt were embroidered the words &quot;cryonics insurance!&quot; :)
<br>
<p>I really chuckled when Rudi said cryonics was not just for the rich or &quot;the 
<br>
lunatic fringe of high-tech wierdos!&quot;  I sure hope no one here is included 
<br>
in the latter group!! lol!  I think in some people's minds all cryonicists 
<br>
and transhumanists are given that label but times are changing.
<br>
<p>While poor Natasha was covered in darkness, Rudi was aglow like a star.  
<br>
Either it was his very sunny personality, luck or he knows how to position 
<br>
himself for an outdoor interview.
<br>
<p>Louise Gold was interviewed with Peter Voss.  Peter Voss simply stated that 
<br>
cryonics is experimental but what do we have to lose anyway?
<br>
<p>I liked Louise Gold's enthusiastic comment that as good as life may be now 
<br>
it could be SO MUCH better in the future if you have faith that science and 
<br>
humanity can work together for good.  And with that in mind cryonics is the 
<br>
thing to do.
<br>
<p>At one point Billy showed a number of books which have been prominent within 
<br>
the cryonics world.  Giving due respect, he showed Robert Ettinger's 
<br>
&quot;Prospect of Immortality&quot; first and then a pile of other books.  I smiled at 
<br>
one title which went something like, &quot;The Boomer's Guide to Living Forever!&quot;
<br>
<p>As the narrator Billy Seidel asked why more people had not yet signed up for 
<br>
cryonics.  Kathleen Cotter, the Alcor cryostasis team coordinator, explained 
<br>
that most people havn't joined because they don't understand what cryonics 
<br>
offers.  And that in time we could be living centuries.
<br>
<p>Matthew Sullivan, the Alcor facility operations/patient care manager, stated 
<br>
society has taught us death is both desirable and unavoidable.
<br>
<p>And Dr. Terry Grossman(author -Boomer's Guide to Living Forever) said he is 
<br>
surprised more people have not yet signed up.  He felt this way since many 
<br>
people say they so badly want to see how the future develops.
<br>
<p>Personally, I tend to think more people have not yet signed up for cryonics 
<br>
because the procedure is not currently fully reversible!  But, that would 
<br>
not make for inspiring public relations.
<br>
<p>When Alcor's three year plan of renovation has been successfully implemented 
<br>
and the Timeship is being used then we will REALLY have something to catch 
<br>
and hold the public eye.  Not as good as reversible suspended animation but 
<br>
still impressive.
<br>
<p>I would hope a follow-up video is made several years from now where David 
<br>
Pizer's venturist community will be mentioned and lauded.  Perhaps, even a 
<br>
brief interview with Robert Ettinger to give credit to the father of 
<br>
cryonics.  Of course, his &quot;children&quot; at Alcor have gone their own way...
<br>
<p>I loved every glimpse given of the Alcor Asilomar conference panels.  The 
<br>
panel on myth-cracking was shown with Natasha Vita-More moderating.  Ralph 
<br>
Merkle gave the best answer he could think of in explaining why a religious 
<br>
person could consider cryonics acceptable and even imperative.  Merkle's 
<br>
argument was that we are here to do God's work and have an imperative to 
<br>
live longer and healthier lives to carry out the almighty's work.  Merkle 
<br>
said this was the most compelling argument on the matter which he knew of 
<br>
though he himself is not religious.
<br>
<p>It was funny seeing Merkle shrug in a self-conscious way when Greg Fahy 
<br>
explained how cryonics was gaining prominence with such scientists as Merkle 
<br>
lending their support.  He didn't seem so terrible then! lol
<br>
<p>Fahy also explained how transhumanist/cryonicist subjects such as nanotech 
<br>
were know getting respectful treatment and it was so refreshing considering 
<br>
how just a few years ago Scientific American had slammed the infant 
<br>
technology.  Then the Scientific American article which discussed 
<br>
Alcor(including a big, glossy pic of Linda Chamberlain standing next to 
<br>
dewars) was shown.
<br>
<p>This video gave the needed attention to vitrification and how it far 
<br>
surpasses the old way of freezing.  A panel excerpt showed Wowk and Fahy 
<br>
explaining the leap forward which it is.  Photos were displayed to show 
<br>
advantages in cell and molecular integrity.  This really helped get the idea 
<br>
across.
<br>
<p>Dr. Rob Newport also very succinctly told how vitrification is so much 
<br>
better over the structural damage freezing would cause.  It was another of 
<br>
the &quot;mini-interviews&quot; which Billy Seidel used throughout.
<br>
<p>Finally, Kathleen Cotter, Alcor biostasis team coordinator, shared again the 
<br>
facts regarding vitrification's superiority over conventional freezing.  The 
<br>
point was definitely well made by several people! lol
<br>
<p>Dr. Max More(hey, he is a doctor of philosophy!) made me really chuckle when 
<br>
on a panel he said that people who would say they would be bored with a 1000 
<br>
year lifespan would also be bored now and not know what to do with 
<br>
themselves next week!! lol
<br>
<p>One person who stood out to me in the video was Dr. Jerry Lemler.  He really 
<br>
struck me as a caring and zestful person.  I loved how he talked about how 
<br>
being free of disease/angst/money worries/travel restrictions in a future 
<br>
post-reanimation world would be so wonderful and almost unimaginable in 
<br>
today's world.  Dr. Lemler said he loves every precious moment of today and 
<br>
wants that second journey.
<br>
<p>Dr. Greg Fahy as a panel speaker stated things will change and get better as 
<br>
time passes for immortals, and it would actually TAKE effort to stay bored 
<br>
in those circumstances!  I don't think he knows some of my friends! lol  I 
<br>
think some people think it's cool to be &quot;bored.&quot;
<br>
<p>I got a big kick out of Jack St. Clair!  He had an infectious english 
<br>
enthusiasm which I found very warm.  He had a sort of &quot;everyman&quot; feel to him 
<br>
which could touch someone otherwise unaffected by the other speakers.  I 
<br>
could see Jack being a gameshow host. :)
<br>
<p>As things progress for Jerry Seidel in the video(as he explores cryonics and 
<br>
decides to join up) he pays a visit to Alcor.  Linda Chamberlain greets him 
<br>
with a warm smile at the door and whisks him to the conference room.
<br>
<p>Linda gives a little history about Alcor and explains a matter of paramount 
<br>
importance to their organization.  That stabilization/standby teams are the 
<br>
key to stopping decay from the moment the heart stops.  This she feels sets 
<br>
Alcor apart among other organizations.
<br>
<p>Stem cell research was brought up here in her interview(and earlier in some 
<br>
detail) to show that biological regeneration really is not science fiction 
<br>
but coming our way soon.
<br>
<p>She pleaded that people not try to sign up friends and relatives while they 
<br>
are on their deathbed or right after death!  Linda explained the whole 
<br>
procedure takes time and so don't procrastinate.
<br>
<p>And Linda relieved any people's worries out there of coming back as old and 
<br>
infirm people! lol  With nanotech, she explained, if they can bring you back 
<br>
at all then making you young will be a breeze by comparison.
<br>
<p>Next, Fred was interviewed.  Billy hit him with the question of whether the 
<br>
money given over to Alcor is safe from dishonesty.  Fred explained that a 
<br>
board of five people separate from the operating organization board preside 
<br>
over the care of these funds and that at least three members have family in 
<br>
biostasis(I'm trying to not say &quot;suspension&quot; anymore!).
<br>
<p>I noticed Fred Chamberlain has definitely been working out and had a proud 
<br>
set of biceps.  Only he and Natasha got to show off this way! lol
<br>
<p>Billy asked Fred about the &quot;immortals who might get very bored&quot; question.  
<br>
Fred replied that even now people can opt out by committing suicide with a 
<br>
gun!!  So, don't worry about getting bored!  This resulted in laughs on the 
<br>
video but made my family and I feel a little awkward...  I understand that a 
<br>
little dry gallows humor can be stress-relieving sometimes, especially for a 
<br>
person who runs an organization which must deal so much with death.
<br>
<p>Fred shared that a variety of people from different walks of life are signed 
<br>
up for cryonics.  I guess some people stereotype cryonicists.  I have read 
<br>
articles saying those signed up are usually &quot;single and lonely white males 
<br>
who are atheistic computer programmers and live in silicon valley!&quot;
<br>
<p>Fred discussed vitrification and how it can benefit cryonicists even before 
<br>
it helps the general public in the form of organ transplantation.  
<br>
Vitrification certainly got good coverage in this production!
<br>
<p>Toward the end we see Billy reading a letter from Alcor congratulating him 
<br>
on having joined.  He says &quot;well, that's it, I made it!&quot;  Billy goes on to 
<br>
tell &quot;I have everything in place and my lifeline to the future is complete.&quot;
<br>
<p>Photographs are shown of people who are currently in biostasis.  Most I did 
<br>
not recognize but FM-2030 was one I certainly did.  As this very touching 
<br>
sequence played out Billy stated &quot;I feel like I really belong someplace, I 
<br>
belong to a community that stands for something important and not just for 
<br>
me but society as a whole.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We have lost too many valuable individual's to the war with death, how much 
<br>
more could they have contributed to the human race if they had had more 
<br>
time?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I know I made the right choice.&quot;
<br>
<p>We then see Billy walking across the desert in twilight to signify the 
<br>
journey we have taken together.
<br>
<p>The ending of this production was so strong.  I do not see how someone could 
<br>
not have been deeply touched by it.  He took cryonics and really showed the 
<br>
humanity behind it.
<br>
<p>During the closing credits a corner of the screen shows various bits from 
<br>
interviews done.  Kathleen Cotter says she chose Alcor because they are 
<br>
simply the best.
<br>
<p>Dr. Newport goes on a flight of intellectual fancy and states he might want 
<br>
to come back as an intelligent butterfly!  Now, what kind of people did Rudi 
<br>
say are sometimes attracted to cryonics? lol  Personally, I want to be a 
<br>
dolphin that can change into an eagle.  I mean to say a dolphgle! ;)
<br>
<p>Dr. Lemler stated Alcor was the most stable and secure cryonics organization 
<br>
and that is why he chose it for he and his family.
<br>
<p>Lastly, Jack St. Clair puts forward a very warm and forthright invitation to 
<br>
the viewer.  &quot;Simply contact Linda or Craig and come and join us!  We want 
<br>
to save our lives and so why don't you save your own as well?  There 
<br>
couldn't have been a better final person for it.
<br>
<p>To conclude things, Billy Seidel had an Alcor contact information graphic 
<br>
run for a LONG time.  I mean you could go eat dinner, come back and there it 
<br>
would still be!  So, if you have someone in your home who says &quot;don't ever 
<br>
rewind the vcr because you will wear it out!&quot;  Don't worry, Billy has you 
<br>
covered! :)
<br>
<p>I wish just a few things had been different.  Real film instead of video 
<br>
would have been so nice(superior in image resolution) but I realize the 
<br>
production price would have been very prohibitive.  I just hope the next 
<br>
production for Alcor is done with film or a digital tech so advanced it does 
<br>
not matter.
<br>
<p>Lighting was a problem.  I did not like seeing things/people in shadows so 
<br>
much or looking somewhat washed out by light.  Again, I realize both money 
<br>
and time was limited.  Things were done &quot;on the fly&quot; at the Alcor 
<br>
conference.  I just hope next time this will be corrected.
<br>
<p>I wish the production had been maybe fifteen minutes longer to flesh out 
<br>
some subjects.  Funding of cryonics comes to mind.  I'm sure Rudi would not 
<br>
have minded! lol  I could tell the interviews had been heavily cut and I 
<br>
wish more of what was said had been included.  I felt a little &quot;editing 
<br>
whiplash&quot; as I saw The Alcor Adventure.
<br>
<p>The public today is so used to seeing very glossy, professional and 
<br>
entertaining productions on network and cable television.  I was concerned 
<br>
that this video's minor shortcomings in production will lesson the impact 
<br>
and opinion of some newcomers to cryonics and Alcor.
<br>
<p>I realize the serious investigator will look past such things but some 
<br>
people are superficially judgemental.  Making judgements strictly based on 
<br>
how another person is dressed is a good example.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, it was still an EXCELLENT production and my total 
<br>
congratulations to Billy Seidel.  If you want a short and concise video 
<br>
which will cover all bases in introducing cryonics and Alcor; well, this is 
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John
