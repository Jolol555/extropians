#Hi.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  (really quite an entertaining accusation, but I digress...). Were I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  these things, I'd support this bill, which I do not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Expressed as you have here, I'd say this position could fairly be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterized as &quot;luddish&quot;.  You say that the &quot;artificial creation of life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the purpose of profit or experimentation â€¦ or spare parts&quot; is wrong (I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave &quot;torture&quot; for later comment).   Without a clearer definition of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;life&quot;, your position seems indistinguishable from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that giving rise to the proposed law under discussion.
</em><br>
<p>#Okay; clearly there are positions somewhere reasonable. As a 
<br>
starting point, let's say conscious, self-aware life. In fact, if 
<br>
you're talking public acceptance, you might be able to confine the 
<br>
definition to the warm-and-fuzzies. I'm not saying the correct thing, 
<br>
morally.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is culturing bacteria 
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;artificial&quot;?  It is certainly &quot;life&quot;.  What about a simple human tissue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture?
</em><br>
<p>#Given the clearer definition you asked for, tissue culture is fine. 
<br>
Bacteria are fine.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is doing so for the purpose of developing a new drug, which one 
<br>
<em>&gt; then sells for economic gain, doing this for &quot;profit&quot; in a way you would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose?
</em><br>
<p>#Not at all. You start torturing monkeys, I have a problem with that. 
<br>
growing entire humans for parts, more of a problem. Cloning a human 
<br>
for parts and coding the clone to be anencephalic--THERE's a dilemma! 
<br>
This would *seem* to avoid the self-aware, conscious def--but does it 
<br>
really? I don't know.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How about a complete human organ?
<br>
<p>#No prob. Grow it in a pig, though, and kill the thing to get it out--
<br>
and we have a problem. Can you see the consistency of the view 
<br>
expressed? It's a middle ground that's far closer to the views 
<br>
expressed here than to the neoludds. I believe most people, if they 
<br>
thought about the matter, would find they occupy the middle ground. A 
<br>
straight &quot;our view and everyone else is a neoludd techiephobe moron&quot; 
<br>
stance guarantees failure and ridicule by the masses as well as 
<br>
intelligent critics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for &quot;torture&quot; - is an experiment in which cultured pathogenic bacteria are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exposed to antibiotics &quot;torture&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>#Doesn't seem so. You could also classify this as self-defense; you 
<br>
did say pathogenic. No big deal.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If one ascribes moral subjectivity to the 
<br>
<em>&gt; bacteria, then it would certainly seem so.
</em><br>
<p>##Samesame.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the bacteria are 
<br>
<em>&gt; transgenic?  Sounds &quot;artificial&quot; to me.
</em><br>
<p>##Still bacteria, but the path may get murky as things go on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously there are degrees and spectra of &quot;life&quot; in a moral sense.
</em><br>
<p>#Absent communing with bacteria to learn their thoughts, if any, It 
<br>
would seem so!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; This sort of thing serves as a reminder that what we take as obvious, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; majority of people think is ~really far out there~.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  #Glad to see someone realizes this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As someone who works in the &quot;mainstream&quot; world of law and governance, I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well aware of how &quot;really far out there&quot; some of our ideas are.  So were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Baruch Spinoza's and, for that matter, Thomas Jefferson's (at least to many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people) in their own times.
</em><br>
<p>#Sure. Point is, this COULD be the future--but isn't necessarily. At 
<br>
the very least, public perceptions will influence timing. The greater 
<br>
the opposition, the greater the dealy in implementation, and the more 
<br>
who die before that (hopefully) becomes unnecessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; It is also a sign that we need to make more inroads in mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; thinking. It is not enough for people to have heard of nanotechnology or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; even know what it is, they better be able to integrate it with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; ethical discourse. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  #Couldn't agree more--yet when morality/ethics issues are raised 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  here, they are ignored at best, dismissed or ridiculed at worst. 'Tis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  troubling, to say the least. The term &quot;techno-cheerleader&quot; (coined 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  by..?) is not at all inappropriate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John, this is simply untrue.  *I* coined the term &quot;techno-cheerleader&quot; (at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least here) and for good reason.  But not to characterize the many fine minds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have engaged in many extended discussions of morality and ethics here. 
</em><br>
<p>#Well, as I said, comment refers to the highly vocal minority. Point 
<br>
'em out; I'd love to see 'em. (Seriously.) 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Rather, it was to make a caricature of how we COULD be misunderstood, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those discussions were ignored.  It seems you're ignoring them.  Just because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every single message in every single thread doesn't contain a moral caution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean that most of us aren't well aware of the deep moral issues 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raised by transhumanism. 
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;In fact, extropianism is, in many respects, a 
<br>
<em>&gt; statement of moral principles in response to the prospect of transhumanism.
</em><br>
<p>#That's the impression I had initially.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  #There is ***in general*** no sense of balance, of restraint, of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  forethought, caution, or consideration of consequences. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just don't see how you can reach this conclusion.  Consider the lengthy, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recurrent discussion of social transparency and privacy which arises almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every time someone mentions a new development in the technologies of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information gathering.
</em><br>
<p>#I'm talking about life, not info proc.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the inevitable moral discussions which 
<br>
<em>&gt; accompany consideration of uploading and cognitive transformation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies.  And the long-running discussion of &quot;augmented&quot; versus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;synthetic&quot; minds is nothing if not a protracted exercise in &quot;forethought, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caution and consideration of consequences.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>#Okay, here's the biggie for me--and maybe it's been covered in the 
<br>
dim and distant past: Loss of humanity. Impression given is, you (the 
<br>
collective you) don't know what the next step (toward posthumanism) 
<br>
is and you don't care; you just want to take it. Don't care what 
<br>
you'll be, just want to get there. Don't consider that when you do, 
<br>
you won't retain human values. That's reckless.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Pointing this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  out draws ad hominem attacks--first refuge of those unable to support 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  their positions with reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not going to get drawn into commenting on the comments about the comments 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have been made about meta-meta-meta observations, but I will simply note 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that your statements above seem to me to be unsupportable generalizations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  #It would be very easy to do a dismissive writeup on the movement, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  presenting the views of the most hotheaded and vocal individuals as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  being typical and representative (taking great care to note their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  affiliations), and print it somewhere prominent. I would not do such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  a thing--both because it would (I hope) be inaccurate and also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  because I agree with many of the concepts espoused by transhumanism--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  but others may well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saying that you could hurt a group of people by picking out the least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appealing members of the group and then depicting them as representative is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true but, with respect, so what?
</em><br>
<p>#I'm warning that someone will eventually do this--that some sort of 
<br>
etiquette is going to have be enforced on the public list or you're 
<br>
going to run into trouble. Yeah I know that flies in the face of the 
<br>
freedom-to-post-anything stance, but there it is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You could do the same thing with any 
<br>
<em>&gt; congregation of people, from the most &quot;mainstream&quot; political party to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group of people gathered at the coffee machine at the office.  Sure, we're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more vulnerable to such tactics, because our ideas are challenging to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great majority of people.
</em><br>
<p>#More I think because most people are unfamiliar with you, haven't 
<br>
thought about these things. If the first thing they hear is some 
<br>
ranting portrayed as typical, that's going to form an initial 
<br>
impression that's hard to overcome.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm certainly aware of this and have on occasion 
<br>
<em>&gt; spoken strongly against ideas I think have the potential for damaging 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism by confused association, especially racism and eugenics.  But I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder what you would propose as an antidote to the problem you perceive; a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;speech code&quot; in which it is mandated that every discussion of advanced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology must be accompanied by a &quot;moral impact statement&quot; less we be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mischaracterized as mad scientists?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  #Transhumanists themselves do their cause far more damage than any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  neoluddite opponent could hope to manage. This was the meaning of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &quot;not ready for prime time&quot; comment. The general observations made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  with that comment explain why. The Principles and the practice do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  coincide. As I said then, this is a pity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't ask you to &quot;back this up&quot; with examples - you could only do so with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an exhaustive analysis of the list's archives.  But I will ask that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest some solution to the problem you perceive.
</em><br>
<p>#Create a rational and comprehensive morality/ethics policy, post it, 
<br>
reference it, keep it up to date and STICK TO IT. Anyone 
<br>
mischaracterizing your aims can be referred to it. Media will be 
<br>
compelled to check it out because it will be easily located and 
<br>
highly relevant. THEN if they portray some nutball as a typical TH or 
<br>
extrope, THEY (the media) will look like the flakes because anyone 
<br>
can see that they've ignored your stated policy. Which of course 
<br>
you'll point out at every opportunity.
<br>
<p>#How does that sound?
<br>
<p>#One note of caution: You're going to have to enforce adherence to 
<br>
it, or its purpose will be destroyed. Folks who don't agree with it 
<br>
ain't on the official party roster.
