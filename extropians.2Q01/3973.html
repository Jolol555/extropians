<p><em>&gt;Curt Adams today offered a derivation purporting to show that if two agents
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the other one was assigned the prior they got, then the posteriors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the two agents will not be the same except under unusual circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that Curt has in fact show this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suspect that Curt thinks that his result contradicts something that I
</em><br>

<p>As I understood the paper you recently referenced on this list, you and Tyler 
<br>
were saying people did not act as truth-seeking Bayesians because they 
<br>
continued to disagree after extensive exchange of information.  From this
<br>
you conclude people usually don't behave as TSB's.  Isn't this reasoning
<br>
at odds with my derivation that Bayesian agents with initially differing 
<br>
priors will usually disagree even after full exchange of information?
<br>
<p>Your paper was indeed based on the assumption of common priors.  
<br>
I don't disagree with the conclusion above, given the cp assumption.
<br>
But, we all know people often act as if they have differing priors.
<br>
You do attempt to justify that people *should* have common priors.
<br>
<p>&quot;If John and Mary have different priors, then they should realize some
<br>
physical process produced that difference.  And if that difference was
<br>
produced randomly or arbitrarily, it is not clear that John and Mary
<br>
should retain it.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's what I was addressing.  If John and Mary do not retain their
<br>
priors, the under most circumstances they aren't acting as rational
<br>
Bayesian agents.  That seems a legitimate reason to maintain
<br>
differing priors.  
<br>
<p>Actually, by my analysis, it is precisely when John and Mary's 
<br>
priors are *most* arbitrary that they should disagree most.  The
<br>
better-based the priors are, the more encountering each other will
<br>
lead to agreement.
