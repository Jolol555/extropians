individualistic

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this is true, it may explain why I am not quite willing to say &quot;I am an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian,&quot; while as the same time sharing many of the same interests and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values. I'm all for my own individual autonomy and freedom (particularly
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; death), but am also concerned about everyone else's--not from any
</em><br>
altruistic
<br>
<em>&gt; sense, but from a practical one. If we're to take, or reclaim, or assert,
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; manufacture this freedom for ourselves, there is great danger in at least
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; offering it to everyone. (Anyone, of course, has the right to refuse it.)
</em><br>
<p>I may have misrepresented the extropian position in that last paragraph, but
<br>
do note the last sentence... I am by no means suggesting a relationship of
<br>
mutually incompatibility between the good of the individual and the good of
<br>
the species. Truly, I'd say they are fairly closely aligned. Natural
<br>
selection has managed to produce our species, members of which quite often
<br>
hold personal survival as their highest goal; if that was in opposition to
<br>
the good of the group, it likely wouldn't be a viewpoint represented with
<br>
such frequency.
<br>
<p>Also, think of this... extropianism might be an highly individualistic
<br>
philosophy, yet it has catalysed the formation of this rather cantankerous
<br>
group. How would that be? Have a look at people who espouse this philosophy,
<br>
and you'll find people who care about providing others with the ability to
<br>
act in an individualistic fashion. In some senses this really is
<br>
altruistic - we care about the future, and what it brings, because in the
<br>
end we really like people and care about what happens to them. Also, as
<br>
you've pointed out, there is a practical aspect. Humans achieve more as a
<br>
group than individually. The kinds of technologies we are looking at require
<br>
cooperation amongst people on often massive scales. Also, a society which
<br>
treasures individualism and dynamism is more likely to allow you, the
<br>
individual, to do the things you want to do - it mightn't help you much, but
<br>
it's unlikely to get in the way.
<br>
<p>I think there's a great temptation to see individualism as being opposed to
<br>
the best interests of the group, often colouring it as immoral or even evil.
<br>
That's an unfortunate simplification, which ignores the fact that the group
<br>
is, in the end, made up of those individuals, who are not entirely blind to
<br>
their interdependence.
<br>
<p>I'll just make a quick comment that having an individualistic outlook might
<br>
colour your political views a bit, but it doesn't dictate them. It doesn't
<br>
necessarily progress to &quot;I gotta get some big g*ns and put in razor wire&quot;.
<br>
In fact, I believe you can support some fairly major governmental
<br>
infrastructure without contradiction, although your demands on the
<br>
transparency and accountability of such institutions might be pretty high.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's long been my contention that where natural selection ends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artifical selection begins (this is an oversimplification). Intelligent
</em><br>
agents
<br>
<em>&gt; (ourselves, for instance) then become responsible for their own evolution,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; for the evolution of intelligence in general, using whatever tools they
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; capable of making. Since we humans have evolved through natural selection
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; the point where we can do this, I don't see how it could be anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;natural&quot; for us to do so. If we were to continue to rely only on &quot;plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanilla natural selection&quot; (as if we could, now), we'd pretty much be
</em><br>
headed
<br>
<em>&gt; for stagnation or extinction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are in accord. Unlike someone else who replied to you rather
<br>
discourteously and without much evidence of a point, I find what you have
<br>
said here completely agreeable. It's a line that I continue to push...
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; loses it's meaning when you talk about what humans will do next.
<br>
We'll do what we will do; it's our nature.
