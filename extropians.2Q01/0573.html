PPl enjoy painful sad or frightening experiences depending on the 
<br>
context/situation
<br>
<p>like... Hot peppers or a good workout, a lovestory's dramatic end, a 
<br>
rollercoaster etc.

<p>How do you know that there is suffering? If you are unhappy right now, I
<br>
grant that you know it. But if not, then your memories of suffering could
<br>
be fake. If a best possible world is one where all possible positive
<br>
experiences occur and no negative experiences occur, then if you are now
<br>
happy it seems that your current evidence is perfectly compatible with
<br>
best-possible-worlds hypothesis. You can poke your finger with a needle,
<br>
and for a while you'll know that the hypothesis is false, but the
<br>
refutation doesn't stick. As soon as you are happy again, you can't be sure.
<br>
<p>(A bizarre thought, admittedly, but I was thinking of including it in a
<br>
footnote in the next version.)
