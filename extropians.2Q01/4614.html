</em><br>
<p>You are in essence arguing that there can be no further constraints on
<br>
what beliefs are rational than standard probability coherence and updating
<br>
by conditionalization.  Your argument is that if you found that your beliefs
<br>
violated some constraint, you could not change your beliefs to avoid the
<br>
violation because doing so would violate conditionalization.  Once you
<br>
have some beliefs the only rational thing to do is conditionalize, no matter
<br>
what.
<br>
<p>This flies in the face of a long philosphy literature considering further
<br>
constraints on rational beliefs. And I think it takes a good idea too far.
<br>
Violating conditionalization only opens you to a dutch book if you do it
<br>
in a predictable way.  Your expectation of your future belief must equal
<br>
your conditional belief, but a non-zero variance is allowed around this.
