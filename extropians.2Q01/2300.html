TJ is supported by University of Colorado. The article mentions two different
<br>
studies of nuclear workers: one studied 37,000 workers and was done by Thomas
<br>
Luckey of the University of Missouri, and the other one studied 150,000 workers
<br>
and the article doesn't say who did that one.
<br>
<p>The theory has already been proven in worms and other creatures, using other
<br>
means of stress like heat. If someone has access to the New Scientist archive
<br>
perhaps they can dig up the whole article.

<em>&gt; &gt; unfortunately I can't find the article online so far. But it talks about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how a little bit of radiation and other kinds of stress might actually be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a good thing. For instance studies of thousands of nuclear workers that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; live on average 17% longer than &quot;normal&quot; people, and have HALF the amount

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be far less common in the 19th and earlier centuries. Some people claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is due to people living longer in 20th century and other factors like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; widespread smoking, but could it also be due to the fact that we are living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such stress-free (in terms of physical environment, not mental stress...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lives that our immune systems are slacking off? The EPA is running a study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now on whether low-level radiation would be beneficial... by 2003 you may
