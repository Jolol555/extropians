<em>&gt; Wow, this looks interesting.  When I first started reading it, I thought it

</em><br>
<em>&gt; these were just control messages over an internal network.  But when I got
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they apparently adjust the representation of the different hormone levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More than one object can effect these levels with source data, and more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one object can modify their own behavior based on these levels.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost like simulating a role-playing game character with various changing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This does sound like an interesting approach.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds to me like you understand the operation (and implications) of Salemi's

work.

This technology extends to &quot;self-configuring&quot; as well as &quot;self-scaling&quot;
<br>
robotics:

The modules connect via one of four docking ports located on four sides of
<br>
each module. The ports pair connectors with infrared communications systems
<br>
that guide the connection process and allow modules to exchange hormone-like
<br>
messages.
<br>
Connected modules communicate using these messages. In addition, modules from
<br>
different robots can also communicate this way via open ports that are 30
<br>
centimeters or closer. This allows robots to coordinate actions and exchange
<br>
modules.
<br>
----------------
<br>
The key to the robot's self-sufficient and autonomous behavior is the
<br>
hormone-like communication system, which allows modules to coordinate
<br>
movements and reconfigurations.
<br>
The modules can broadcast messages to the other modules that make up a robot.
<br>
These messages trigger the specific actions required for the robots to
<br>
assemble, move and change shape.
<br>
Like biological hormones, the messages last only a certain length of time,
<br>
trigger different actions in different receiving sites, and leave the
<br>
execution and coordination of a local action to the module performing the
<br>
action.

<p>Some folks imagine robots that exchange messages like organisms exchange
<br>
pheromones.
<br>
Huge teams of rather simple robots could build complex structures by
<br>
communicating instructions to each other the way ants do, via
<br>
olfactory/hormonal code.
<br>
<p>Here's some hype about &quot;reconfigurable robots&quot;
<br>
The USC/ISI CONRO PROJECT
<br>
<a href="http://www.isi.edu/conro/">http://www.isi.edu/conro/</a>
<br>
The base topology is simply connected, as in a snake, but the system can
<br>
reconfigure itself in order to grow a set of legs or other specialized
<br>
appendages. Each module will consist of a CPU, some memory, a battery, and a
<br>
micro-motor plus a variety of other sensors and functionality, including
<br>
vision and wireless connection and docking sensors. Major challenges include
<br>
packaging, power and cooling as well as the major issue of programming and
<br>
program control.
<br>
<p>Like the man said:
<br>
&quot;The only thing missing is most of the knowledge
<br>
we'll need to make such machines intelligent. Indeed,
<br>
as you might guess from all this, the focus of re-
<br>
search in Artificial Intelligence should be to find good
<br>
ways, as Vinge's fantasy suggests, to connect struc-
<br>
tures with functions through the use of symbols.&quot;
<br>
--Marvin Minsky, Afterword to True Names, 1984
<br>
<p>Some experimenters have gone so far as to equate robot hormones to emotions:
<br>
Artificial Emotions as Emergent Phenomena
<br>
<a href="http://fox.nstn.ca/~aai/roman93.htm">http://fox.nstn.ca/~aai/roman93.htm</a>
<br>
Although some researchers claim that emotion is unique to mammals, this paper
<br>
describes a notion of artificial emotion as a phenomenon resulting from a
<br>
series of modifications to emergent behaviors generated by a behavior-based
<br>
artificial intelligence (AI) approach. Such modifications to behaviors are
<br>
caused by stimuli (including those from humans) which a robot receives from
<br>
its environment. The paper describes a series of experiments to generate and
<br>
test artificial emotion using Subsumption Architecture (SA) robot platforms
<br>
developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). A &quot;hormone
<br>
mechanism&quot;, which is part of the behavior definition language, was used to
<br>
generate artificial emotion. In addition, the Action Selection Dynamics (ASD)
<br>
paradigm proposed by Pattie Maes as a way to implement Computational
<br>
Reflection was also tried. The latter is expected to permit us to investigate
<br>
more profound ontological issues associated with artificial emotion as part of
<br>
the experiments in Computational Reflection.
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
