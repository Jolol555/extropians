<p>My thinking is that in humans the mate selection pressure would be
<br>
towards females with a narrow waist.  My reasoning would be that
<br>
those males who randomly had that trait passed on their genes with
<br>
a slightly higher probability. As a result of their taste, they would
<br>
choose those females not already impregnated by a different male.
<br>
The same effect would cause males and perhaps females to prefer
<br>
younger mates.
<br>
<p>This speculation could be tested easily using chimps.  Presumably
<br>
chimps have not been socialized to prefer slender mates.  Has
<br>
there been an experiment where male chimps are given the choice of
<br>
fat or thin mates?  I suspect they would differentially choose the thin.
