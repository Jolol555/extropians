Anders writes, regarding Ken MacLeod,
<br>
<em>&gt; Having finished his tetralogy in the Star Fraction universe, I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prizes are well deserved: not just literary but also because he does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a rather fresh perspective on libertarian themes. Each novel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presents a different perspective on events, and while only _The Stone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Canal_ has a politically libertarian protagonist I think the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome of his analysis of events seems to be very libertarian in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlook. It is not a simplistic libertarianism, but rather something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along Virginia Postrel's dynamism - the point is not whether you are an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchocapitalist, anarchosocialist or just practically minding your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business, but whether you are open to change, freedom and responsibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for your actions.
</em><br>
<p>I've been trying to read The Stone Canal, and it's heavy going.  Granted,
<br>
when reading SF I expect to be faced with strange cultures, alien viewpoints,
<br>
unfamiliar references.
<br>
<p>I just don't expect to find that in the flashbacks to present-day Earth.
<br>
<p>New Mars, with its human-equivalent machines, its violent anarchy, and
<br>
all its futuristic technology, is far more comfortable and understandable
<br>
to me than 1970s England.
<br>
<p>Here they are at the bookstore, regarding the owners;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Probably on old ILP'er or something,&quot; Reid muttered, pouncing on a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blue Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co. voume of Dietzgen.  he blew dust off it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sneezed.
<br>
<p>What's an ILP'er?  Who's Dietzgen?  Later, they find some interesting
<br>
books:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was almost certainly unique, a living fossil: a wartime Russia
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today Society pamphlet called Soviet Millionaires.  It hadn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stayed in circulation long, not after the SPGB had seized on it as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrefutable proof that behind the socialist facade the USSR concealed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a class of wealthy property-owners.
<br>
<p>What's the SPGB?  Why would their conclusion about this magazine take
<br>
it out of circulation?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, now, what about this?&quot;  He opened a book and studied the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fly-leaf.  &quot;Stirner, The Ego and His own, property of the Glasgow
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anarchist Workers' Circle, 1043.  Five pounds.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is supposedly quite a find!  Wow!  Stirner!  Who's Stirner?
<br>
Later they go to the &quot;Union smoking room&quot;:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both sat back at the same moment.  Reid toyed with the bamboo
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holder of the previous day's Guardian.  The MPLA had taken Huambo,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not for the last time.
<br>
<p>Who's the MPLA?  What is Huambo?  (I have two theories: one is that
<br>
Huambo is some kind of newspaper, an underground competitor to the more
<br>
established Guardian, and the MPLA is a leftist group which steals it
<br>
to read it at home.  The other is that Huambo is some kind of military
<br>
target and the MPLA an insurgent group, and it has changed hands many
<br>
times as the tides of battle have shifted.)
<br>
<p>Later they're at McDonalds with the family:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father spotted a young woman carrying a bundle of papers...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and asked her in a tone of polite curiosity: &quot;Why don't you fight
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capitalism, for a change?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the young woman had said only a few sentences, he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stopped her with a smile and an uplifeted finger.  He looked at his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watch and brought the finger down to tap it triumphantly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One minute, twenty-five seconds,&quot; he said to the puzzled cadre.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Congratulations.  That's the shortest time yet for a member of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- let me see --&quot; he made a pretence of counting on his fingers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;-- a split, from a split, from a split, from the Fourth International
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to call *me* a sectarian!&quot;
<br>
<p>Wow, what a put-down.  He sure got her, eh?  But what's the Fourth
<br>
International?  And why would she have called him a sectarian?  Is that
<br>
something nasty?
<br>
<p>All the early flashbacks are full of this stuff.  It's utterly
<br>
incomprehensible, some kind of alien world where everything I know is
<br>
turned upside down.
<br>
<p>I was in college in the 1970s.  I'm the same age as these characters.
<br>
Maybe I didn't hang out with the right people, but I don't think
<br>
the culture described here existed in anything like this form in the
<br>
U.S.  The pervasive leftism, the labelling of positions, the careful
<br>
hair-splitting to find out exactly which leftist category you fit into,
<br>
it's all utterly bizarre.
<br>
<p>If he were making up this kind of stuff for his alien culture, an author
<br>
would feel obligated to explain a little more about what is going on.
<br>
But since he's apparently describing a real place and time, he doesn't
<br>
feel the need.  As someone who grew up in a very different milieu,
<br>
I find it awfully hard to understand the emotional currents and the
<br>
unstated meanings which are flying hot and heavy in these passages.
<br>
<p>I think I see why The Cassini Division was released first in the U.S.
<br>
It doesn't suffer from this problem.  Without being motivated by wanting
<br>
to see what came before, I suspect that American readers would give up
<br>
on The Stone Canal in the first hundred pages.
