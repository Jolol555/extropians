J Corbally enriched the signal by noting,
<br>
<em>&gt; I've read his book &quot;In the Mind of the Machine&quot;.  He accepts that AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming, but doesn't think humans will survive it.  He doesn't buy into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading or &quot;machine enhanced human&quot; scenarios.
</em><br>
<p>Couldn't find &quot;In the Mind of the Machine&quot; at Amazon or BN, but google worked
<br>
wonderfully:
<br>
&quot;It is surprising how humans, for the most part, appear to accept as a basic
<br>
principle that they are the superior beings on Earth, that is how it is now
<br>
and that is how it always will be . . . This is clearly wishful thinking on
<br>
the part of humans.&quot; --Kevin Warwick
<br>

<br>
&quot;The human race, as we know it, is very likely in its end game; our period of
<br>
dominance on Earth is about to be terminated. We can try and reason and
<br>
bargain with the machines which take over, but why should they listen when
<br>
they are far more intelligent than we are? All we should expect is that we
<br>
humans are treated by the machines in the same way that we now treat other
<br>
animals, as slave workers, energy producers or curiosities in zoos. We must
<br>
obey their wishes and live only to serve all our lives, what there is of them,
<br>
under the control of machines.&quot;
<br>
<p>At Amazon.com I found these titles by Warwick:
<br>
*Failsafe Control Systems : Applications and Emergency Management
<br>
by Kevin Warwick, Ming T. Tham
<br>
*Robotics : Applied Mathematics and Computational Aspects (The Institute of
<br>
Mathematics and Its Applications Conference Series, New Series No 41)
<br>
*Control Systems : An Introduction (Prentice Hall International Series in
<br>
Systems and Control Engineering)
<br>
*Computer-Intensive Methods in Control and Signal Processing : The Curse of
<br>
Dimensionality
<br>
*Implementation of Self Tuning Controller (Control Engineering Series, 35)
<br>
<p>and at BN.com:
<br>
*Virtual Reality in Engineering
<br>
*Mutual Impact of Computing Power and Control Theory
<br>
and a few others...
<br>
<p>Warwick has been at this quite a while.
<br>
<p>Maybe his chip/human interfacing experiments will soften some of his dire
<br>
predictions.
<br>
