<p>I did not know that, thanks!  As far as I can tell, the U.S. constitution
<br>
doesn't guarantee privacy.  Ive heard of the 7th amendment, having to
<br>
do with citizens not being required to quarter soldiers, can be used as
<br>
an indication that the government hasn't the right to spy on its
<br>
citizens, but it is not clear to me that was the original intent.  I
<br>
suspect the original intent was to keep the young soldiers from
<br>
getting an easy roll in the haystack with the citizen's daughter.
<br>
This nation's population is likely much lower because of that
<br>
amendment.
<br>
<p>Ive been an openness advocate in the past, but recently very
<br>
quiet on this issue.  I originally theorized that increasing
<br>
transparency would result in a more permissive society.
<br>
I have seen no clear evidence our society is getting more
<br>
permissive, altho it is certainly getting more transparent.
<br>
I can't tell the UK is getting more permissive, altho I hear
<br>
it is becoming more transparent at a faster rate than the U.S.
<br>
Consequently Im still rethinking my notions.  spike
