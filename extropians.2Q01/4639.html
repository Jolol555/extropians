<p><p>I think this is an incorrect characterization.
<br>
<p>The bonafide rural population doesn't take nature for granted, rather it 
<br>
sees nature for what it really is.  The &quot;environmentalists and nature 
<br>
worshippers&quot; who have spent little time living in natural surroundings have 
<br>
a very black and white perspective of nature that is naive and wildly 
<br>
underestimates the complexity and interactions of the system.  True rural 
<br>
folk see a big mixture of gray and colors, not the imagined contrast of the 
<br>
urban environmentalist.  Therefore, most rural folk tend to be 
<br>
&quot;conservationists&quot;, which work with nature rather than trying to 
<br>
artificially enforce an extreme contrast that any rural folk could tell you 
<br>
is neither good nor natural.
<br>
<p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions; the environmentalists may 
<br>
mean well, but could stand to first learn a few lessons in reality from the 
<br>
people who have lived in those rural lands for many years, lest they 
<br>
destroy the very thing they intend to save.  Many environmentalists are 
<br>
utopians in the same sense that communists were in the first part of the 
<br>
20th century, having constructed wonderful ideas that necessarily rely on 
<br>
poorly evaluated assumptions.
