<em>&gt;I predict many waves of complex, long-term diseases to be a big health
</em><br>
<em>&gt;challenge to life extensionists in the future.  We are already seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;epidemics in cancer, Alzheimer's, heart attacks, MS, and other &quot;complicated&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diseases.  Our big threats are no longer microbes, but complex environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factors that interact with our bodies over the long term.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Are there any good reasons to think these diseases are not caused by microbes?
<br>
&nbsp;Paul Ewald's book Plague Time points out that if problems like this were
<br>
merely the result of bad genes, evolution would probably have eliminated them.
<br>
Whereas small organisms that prey on us can evolve fast enough that our
<br>
genes should be expected to be a bit too out of date to fully deal with
<br>
those microbes. It seems from evolutionary considerations like there ought
<br>
to be a fair number of organisms pursuing a strategy of infecting people in
<br>
ways that only show harm decades after they infect a person, and that most
<br>
people should have some of these infections.
<br>
&nbsp;Ewald presents some fairly strong evidence that the medical community has a
<br>
long history of underestimating the number of diseases that are caused by
<br>
microbes. I don't see any signs that the medical community has corrected
<br>
the biases that have caused that underestimation.
<br>
&nbsp;Plague Time is a bit too sensationalist. But since Ewald's prior book, The
<br>
Evolution of Infectious Diseases, was much more rigorous (and somewhat less
<br>
interesting), I don't think this sensationalism indicates he's careless
<br>
(merely that he's at least as interested in selling books as he is in
<br>
informing people).
