<p><em>&gt;Our current simulations simplify.  There is no reason to believe that a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason to believe that what looks like the point of simplification to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the creators of the simulation would look simple to the creatures within
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the simulation.  As that might be where that outside the simulation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more accessible it might well look quite complex, random and contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all reason to the creatures within it.  Sound familiar?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but not in the way you want.  Simplify less, perhaps; but you will
<br>
still have a bottom level, the kind of thing we don't see.  I think the
<br>
appeal to unimaginably powerful beings with mysterious motivations
<br>
and an intense need to hide from humanity sounds like certain 
<br>
religious apologia.  Why 10^27 supercomputers to sim me?  Why
<br>
sim a huge universe when our galaxy would be more than adequate?
<br>
<p>If the entire universe has been simmed but some super-universe
<br>
creatures as an experiment, they are not our descendants.  Also,
<br>
they're simming the whole shebang and not us; we're just an 
<br>
epiphenomenom and our actions won't make them turn it off.
