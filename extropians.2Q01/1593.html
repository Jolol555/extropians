<p>Damien, you of course exemplify this to the n'th power.  I am
<br>
wondering however if this theory would not need reexamination
<br>
in light of the parallel processing, perhaps and Darwinian selection
<br>
that we know or suspect occurs in the brain?
<br>
<p>Most computer languages that I know of are 'finite'-state grammars
<br>
but allow the production of arbitrarily complex 'statements'.
<br>
(someone correct me if this I'm being imprecise.)
<br>
<p>This needs a more rigorous explanation and/or citations if I am
<br>
to believe this.  (I've heard Chomsky speak (on a totally unrelated
<br>
political topic) and respect him, but I also know that his perspective
<br>
is under some questioning in academic circles currently.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [snip] But that doesn't mean the templates come pre-stocked, far from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Input and output require *generative* processes that Chomskyans would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say exceed any look-up table that we could realistically anticipate (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature).
</em><br>
<p>But we are not requiring the zombies to &quot;generate&quot; our reality.
<br>
We only require them to 'adhere' to it sufficiently that it causes
<br>
the reality to follow along paths that are sufficiently accurate
<br>
to satisfy the needs of the simulation.  I.e. zombies, only have
<br>
to be 'perceived' to be real by the individuals for whom the
<br>
simulation is constructed.  The lookup table for &quot;Honey, I love
<br>
you&quot; -- &quot;Well darling, I love you too.&quot; *isn't* very big!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I understand it, models of cognitive function these days assume at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two classes of storage and access: some lookup tables or something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them (where the brain checks the index and goes straight to the answer),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and some constructive imagery procedures where, eg, one wanders around on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an imaginary map looking for the answer  (the time taken being a linear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure of the amount of `mental space' walked through).
</em><br>
<p>I think this may be tied to something concrete with spatial
<br>
representations of familiar objects.  I think its been determined
<br>
that on average you store 3 representations for an object (e.g. a fork).
<br>
You then spatially transform an object (presumably in parallel)
<br>
and match it against the database of stored images (also presumably
<br>
in parallel) to 'recognize' the object as a fork.  The degree
<br>
to which to object is in an 'uncommon' orientation relative to
<br>
the stored images determines the recognition time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm uncertain how Freeman/Hopfield-style attractor models fit into this:
</em><br>
<p>There could quite easily be a feedback loop in that the lookup
<br>
of the data &quot;asserts&quot; that it has a good match, which may
<br>
encourage a reformation of the input to better match the
<br>
stored data causing a cascade up to the level of consciousness
<br>
that says &quot;yes, indeed, that is a fork&quot;.  This quite nicely
<br>
explains the 'incorrect' recall of witnesses where they match
<br>
their 'so-called' memories to their expectations.
<br>
<p>So perhaps to deal with the zombie instantiation properly
<br>
we do not have 'exact' lookup tables, but instead 'fuzzy'
<br>
lookup tables.
