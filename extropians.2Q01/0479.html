Brian:  These chips would be over 500 times faster than the best Athlons
<br>
or Pentium 4s we have now. And in only 5 years. WOW
<br>
<p>Eliezer:  If this is true, a medium-sized research project should
<br>
definitely be able to buy enough power for &quot;true AI&quot; by 2005-2007.  Of
<br>
course, that's hardware rather than software - but still.

<p>Tech Titans To Build 'Supercomputer on a Chip'
<br>
<p>By Tim McDonald, www.NewsFactor.com
<br>
<p>IBM, Toshiba Corp. and Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. announced an
<br>
alliance on Monday aimed at advancing computer chip technology that will
<br>
enable consumers to buy electronic devices that will be more powerful than
<br>
IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer within five years.
<br>
<p>The companies said they will commit US$400 million to develop a
<br>
&quot;supercomputer on a chip&quot; -- processors that will operate at low power and
<br>
that will be able to access the Internet via broadband at ultra-high
<br>
speeds.  &quot;The processor platform that people have only been able to
<br>
imagine is now going to become a reality,&quot; said Ken Kutaragi, president
<br>
and chief executive officer of Sony CEI.
<br>
<p>Code-named 'Cell'
<br>
<p>Officials for all three companies said at the announcement in Tokyo that
<br>
the new microchips, code-named &quot;Cell,&quot; will use the world's most advanced
<br>
research technologies and chip-making techniques.
<br>
<p>As for what types of electronic devices will use the chips and be
<br>
available for widespread use by consumers, plans are still uncertain,
<br>
Sony's Chris Andrews told NewsFactor Network.  &quot;It really remains to be
<br>
seen exactly where [the chips will be used], but it will be computing
<br>
devices that consumers will use to connect to and interact with the
<br>
Internet,&quot; Andrews said.  &quot;They will essentially be more powerful than
<br>
some of the most advanced supercomputer chips,&quot; Andrews told NewsFactor,
<br>
&quot;but will find their way into more consumer applications, in addition to
<br>
servers and high-end applications.&quot;
<br>
<p>IBM To License Technology
<br>
<p>The project will employ 300 chip designers and computer architects at its
<br>
peak, all working toward the goal of developing a &quot;teraflop-class&quot;
<br>
consumer processor. A teraflop is one trillion floating point operations
<br>
per second.  Under the agreement, IBM will license to Sony its 0.10 micron
<br>
processing technology, which reduces the size of circuit features and
<br>
enables smaller chips to run at faster speeds. The fastest current
<br>
microchips are produced at 0.11 microns or 0.13 microns.  Production on a
<br>
commercial scale at a sub-0.10 micron level -- 10,000 times thinner than a
<br>
human hair -- has not yet been achieved.
<br>
<p>Officials for Sony, the world's second-largest consumer electronics maker,
<br>
said the technology will allow the company to build more advanced
<br>
production lines in Japan for the microprocessors used in its line of
<br>
PlayStation game consoles. Sony was plagued last year with shortages of
<br>
the new PlayStation2, particularly in the U.S. where demand was great.
<br>
<p>New Wave of Devices
<br>
<p>The three high-tech companies, which will share a development center to be
<br>
housed within an IBM facility in Austin, Texas, said the agreement calls
<br>
for all three firms to manufacture the product for &quot;a new wave of
<br>
devices.&quot;  With built-in broadband connectivity, ultra-high speed networks
<br>
will be expanded and become more closely linked, in effect forming one
<br>
unified &quot;super-system,&quot; the companies claimed.
<br>
<p>&quot;Just as biological cells in the body unite to form complete physical
<br>
systems, 'Cell-based' electronic products of all types will form the
<br>
building blocks of larger systems,&quot; Kutaragi said.  IBM also announced on
<br>
Monday that it is joining the efforts of a computer chip industry group
<br>
studying ways of coming up with smaller circuit patterns on semiconductors
<br>
for the purpose of boosting their speed.
<br>
<p>The consortium is experimenting with extreme ultra-violet light as a means
<br>
of printing the increasingly complex circuits on next-generation
<br>
processors.
