Ross I appreciate your comments. Still....
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Given an average healthy pair of a human male and female, the male has
<br>
thousands upon thousands of sperm, per day, while the female has a
<br>
lifetime supply of maybe hundreds of eggs.&gt;&gt;
<br>
Biological fact yes. Which makes &quot;sperm collection&quot; a much easier task
<br>
logistically than &quot;egg collection&quot;. which is an important point!
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Basically, the women have the only functional human reproductive system
<br>
in the planet, the women basically have total control of reproduction.
<br>
That is a qualified statement.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true after a fashion. I would like to change this. In a functional
<br>
sense
<br>
(i.e. redirect the power flow) even if technology is a long way from a
<br>
synthetic
<br>
womb. One of the easiest ways (given the prescence of surrogate gestation
<br>
hosts)
<br>
is to &quot;rent&quot; a womb that is much further down the socioeconomic power
<br>
gradient
<br>
than you are. This sort of thing doesn't have to be cruel. It can be a very
<br>
compassionate act to a human from an underdeveloped country with very'
<br>
few options.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;By the same token, more men are in positions of relative &quot;power&quot;, or so
<br>
the media would have us believe.  So, some people in power are corrupt.
<br>
<p>So, the point is to be a male brain surgeon, that way the women want
<br>
your genes for their children, or to have a nice car.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But &quot;your point&quot; is based on the 'fact' that women are holding all the
<br>
aces
<br>
in this poker game. I am suggesting that 'while this is so in fact' in
<br>
application
<br>
the matter can be played out differently. Much like an army with lesser
<br>
numbers
<br>
triumphing through better strategy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again..it is now possible to spend your money and divorce sex from the
<br>
repro
<br>
equation. This is rather startling..since it's usually sex that drives men
<br>
into situations
<br>
where repro becomes feasible...not the other way around (which is the
<br>
biological
<br>
reality).
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I don't think I want a clone, it would be somewhat like inbreeding.  I'd
<br>
be happy to donate a cloned &quot;good sperm&quot; to a wide variety of screened
<br>
candidates.  If I have the option to select a sperm cell to impregnate,
<br>
then it would have to have a better method than the &quot;survival of the
<br>
fittest&quot; natural selection of natural insemination.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;I have considered the method you suggest.  Cloning would not be
<br>
inbreeding, more like the ultimate in genetic conservatism. It all
<br>
depends on how much you have to conserve, and how important
<br>
it is to get a good investment. I like to think I have a good deal
<br>
to conserve, and that a random gene shuffle with most females would
<br>
result in a less than optimal result (which tends to narrow my focus
<br>
to the very best of the female side of the species house).  I also tend
<br>
to think that with the possible exception of meta-pursuits like self-
<br>
improvement and attainment of enlightenment there are NO
<br>
investements more important than offspring. though others may not
<br>
agree.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And while I would not be adverse to being a donor I feel oddly
<br>
about siring children without interaction with them. Anything else
<br>
feels like abandonment (sortof like your inbreeding feeling eh?).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly would not relish dying or going into cryostasis knowing
<br>
I had not contributed to the epigenetic essence of my children's psyches.
<br>
Eugenics is hardly the cureall people claim it to be, euthenics is
<br>
equally important I like to think.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I have noted is that it's fairly easy to get &quot;Nobel prize&quot; sperm
<br>
but seems rather harder to purchase &quot;genius eggs&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Given current technology the hormonal treatments neccessary to collect
<br>
multiple eggs from a donor mean it's not the easy painless task that
<br>
sperm donation is for a medical student.  I think this is another reason
<br>
why cloning will become popular. It doesn't require nearly as much
<br>
paperwork,
<br>
and it eliminates a major cash outlay going to the egg donor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end..it will be about the money!
