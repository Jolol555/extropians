<p><em>&gt;You are in essence arguing that there can be no further constraints on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what beliefs are rational than standard probability coherence and updating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by conditionalization.  Your argument is that if you found that your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violated some constraint, you could not change your beliefs to avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violation because doing so would violate conditionalization.  
</em><br>
<p>Not at all!  I'm not saying there's never a reason to violate Bayesian 
<br>
conditionalization (Bc), just that if you do so you're violating Bc and not 
<br>
entirely Bayesian.  I think people violate Bc all the  time due to 
<br>
computational reasons.  I do consider Bayesian inference the ideal, so I want 
<br>
to see a reason to give it up before I do so.  If, for example, maintaining 
<br>
an independent prior resulted in getting booked or taken in an idea market, 
<br>
then that could be a legitimate reason to ditch Bayesianism.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This flies in the face of a long philosphy literature considering further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constraints on rational beliefs. And I think it takes a good idea too far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Violating conditionalization only opens you to a dutch book if you do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a predictable way.  Your expectation of your future belief must equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your conditional belief, but a non-zero variance is allowed around this.
</em><br>
<p>You are correct and my statement was too strong.  However, adding variability 
<br>
to post-conditionalization opinions will on average worsen disagreement, so  
<br>
that won't serve to coordinate priors.  You've also neglected the other way 
<br>
to avoid strict Bayesianism, which is simply to refuse the bets.  I think 
<br>
this would be the only way out of some hypothetical inconsistent/unusable 
<br>
prior set - the agent has must either refuse the actions that expose the 
<br>
problems with the prior or refuse bets on their responses to having bad 
<br>
priors exposed.
