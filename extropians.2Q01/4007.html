<p><em>&gt;You were addressing updating on the fact that someone else received
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the prior they did, not on the fact of yourself receiving the prior

</em><br>
<p>You make a huge assumption with the consistency assumption, that a prior is 
<br>
obtained by updating the uberprior with the fact of the prior assignment.  
<br>
This assumption is a generalized equivalent to my condition that prior 
<br>
probabilities must be a particular function of the world state.  Essentially 
<br>
you assume that all priors are extremely well founded.  An easy example  
<br>
where this is false is that the uberprior offers two possible priors (25% of 
<br>
Q vs. 75% of Q) and a 50% chance of Q, regardless of assigned prior.  
<br>
Updating the uberprior with the assigned prior leaves the expectation for 
<br>
worldstate probabilities unchanged and at variance with the obtained prior.   
<br>
I haven’t proved it yet, but if you apply your condition to my simplified situ
<br>
ation you’re going to extract my prior probability requirement.  Because your 
<br>
condition is more generally applicable it’s not immediately obvious what an 
<br>
incredibly strong assumption it is.
<br>
<p>Another way of stating it is that you effectively assume everybody has the 
<br>
same prior (the uberprior) which has only been altered by events in perfect 
<br>
accordance with Bayesian inference, even though the inference process is 
<br>
cloaked; i.e., private information.  Given that assumption, yes, it is 
<br>
rational for John and Mary to update their beliefs on each other’s priors; 
<br>
the differences between their priors results only from good Bayesian 
<br>
inference on honest data.  But that is not my experience of priors, at all; 
<br>
as far as I can tell, they’re pretty random even where humans should have 
<br>
built-in data like social interaction and completely random for, say, 
<br>
chemisty.
<br>
<p>Technically, you're right that we agree; we've both shown a strong 
<br>
restriction on prior assignments is necessary and sufficient to cause 
<br>
Bayesian agents that hold such priors to hold common beliefs on encountering 
<br>
each other.  [Technically, I showed it's necessary and you that it's 
<br>
sufficient; but the inversions are trivial.]  Your derivation is more general 
<br>
and complete than mine.  However, the restriction is generally false in the 
<br>
real world; this is immediately obvious the way I state it but not so obvious 
<br>
the way you do.
