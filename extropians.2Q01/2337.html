I should be able to help with a few things here...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; muttered, pouncing on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     blue Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co. voume of Dietzgen. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he blew dust off it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and sneezed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's an ILP'er?  Who's Dietzgen?  Later, they find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books:
</em><br>
<p>The ILP is the Independent Labour Party, which was
<br>
formed in 1893 in Britian.  For the curious, look
<br>
here:

<br>
<p>Dietzgen was a socialist 'proletarian' philosopher.  I
<br>
found a quote of his that seems appropriate here, &quot;We
<br>
may leave certain objects of scientific research to
<br>
professionals, but general thought is a public
<br>
matter...&quot;  There's a book of his essays that you may
<br>
be able find called &quot;Some of the Philosophical Essays
<br>
on Socialism and Science, Religion, Ethics,
<br>
Critique-of-Reason and the World-at-large&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     This was almost certainly unique, a living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fossil: a wartime Russia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Today Society pamphlet called Soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Millionaires.  It hadn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     stayed in circulation long, not after the SPGB
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had seized on it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     irrefutable proof that behind the socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facade the USSR concealed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a class of wealthy property-owners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the SPGB?  Why would their conclusion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this magazine take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it out of circulation?
</em><br>
<p>The SPGB is the Socialist Party of Great Britain,
<br>
which has been in exsistance since 1903.  They
<br>
envision a &quot;democratic, non-statist, non-market
<br>
socialism in opposition to Social Democracy and
<br>
Leninism.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &quot;Ah, now, what about this?&quot;  He opened a book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and studied the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     fly-leaf.  &quot;Stirner, The Ego and His own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of the Glasgow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Anarchist Workers' Circle, 1043.  Five pounds.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is supposedly quite a find!  Wow!  Stirner! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who's Stirner?
</em><br>
<p>Max Stirner, famous anarchist.  The book in question,
<br>
&quot;The Ego and His Own&quot;, can be found in full here:

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Later they go to the &quot;Union smoking room&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     We both sat back at the same moment.  Reid toyed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the bamboo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     holder of the previous day's Guardian.  The MPLA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had taken Huambo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     not for the last time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who's the MPLA?  What is Huambo?  (I have two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories: one is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huambo is some kind of newspaper, an underground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitor to the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established Guardian, and the MPLA is a leftist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group which steals it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to read it at home.  The other is that Huambo is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; target and the MPLA an insurgent group, and it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed hands many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times as the tides of battle have shifted.)
</em><br>
<p>Your second guess is more accurate.  The MPLA is the
<br>
&quot;People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola&quot;, and
<br>
Huambo is a city in Angola.  The MPLA (founded in
<br>
1956) is a movement for complete independence.  During
<br>
the war for independence from Portugal (which broke
<br>
out in 1961) the MPLA was supported by socialist and
<br>
communist states, UNITA (National Union for the Total
<br>
Independence of Angola) was backed by western powers,
<br>
and the FNLA (National Front for the Liberation of
<br>
Angola) was backed by the 'nonleft' power groups of
<br>
southern Africa.  The MPLA and UNITA are still at war.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Later they're at McDonalds with the family:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       My father spotted a young woman carrying a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bundle of papers...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and asked her in a tone of polite curiosity:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Why don't you fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     capitalism, for a change?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       But after the young woman had said only a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     stopped her with a smile and an uplifeted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finger.  He looked at his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     watch and brought the finger down to tap it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triumphantly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &quot;One minute, twenty-five seconds,&quot; he said to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the puzzled cadre.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;Congratulations.  That's the shortest time yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a member of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     -- let me see --&quot; he made a pretence of counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on his fingers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;-- a split, from a split, from a split, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Fourth International
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to call *me* a sectarian!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow, what a put-down.  He sure got her, eh?  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's the Fourth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; International?  And why would she have called him a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sectarian?  Is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something nasty?
</em><br>
<p>The Fourth International is the latest, and probably
<br>
least significant, of a series of Internationals.  It
<br>
is Trotskyist is nature.  Trotskyism being one of many
<br>
leftist &quot;sects&quot;.  The official website of the Fourth
<br>
International is here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.internationalen.se/sp/fi.htm">http://www.internationalen.se/sp/fi.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Much more interesting was the First International
<br>
(1864), which was split between the authoritarian
<br>
Marxists (led by Marx) and the anti-authoritarian
<br>
anarchists (led by Bakunin).  A few websites:

<br>
<p><em>&gt; All the early flashbacks are full of this stuff. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomprehensible, some kind of alien world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything I know is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned upside down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was in college in the 1970s.  I'm the same age as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these characters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I didn't hang out with the right people, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the culture described here existed in anything like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this form in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.  The pervasive leftism, the labelling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions, the careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hair-splitting to find out exactly which leftist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category you fit into,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's all utterly bizarre.
</em><br>
<p>It did indeed exist, you just didn't hang out with the
<br>
right people.  Here's a nice list of such groups as
<br>
they exist today in the US:
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/redencyclopedia/groups.htm">http://www.geocities.com/redencyclopedia/groups.htm</a>
<br>
And in the world:
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/4192/">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Lobby/4192/</a>
<br>
<p>And for general interest and learning more about all
<br>
this crazy stuff, I suggest going here:
<br>
<a href="http://infoshop.org">http://infoshop.org</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If he were making up this kind of stuff for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien culture, an author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would feel obligated to explain a little more about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But since he's apparently describing a real place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and time, he doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel the need.  As someone who grew up in a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different milieu,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find it awfully hard to understand the emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currents and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstated meanings which are flying hot and heavy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these passages.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure that the average person that picks up a
<br>
scientific text, or who reads this list, feels much
<br>
the same way.  Speaking as someone who is fairly
<br>
familiar with this stuff; in order to fully explain
<br>
all these references, the author would probably have
<br>
to at least double the length of his book.  And unless
<br>
he had all this information off in a glossary or
<br>
something, he would have to have written a very
<br>
different work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite sad, I think, that this kind of
<br>
information is so unknown in this country.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think I see why The Cassini Division was released
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't suffer from this problem.  Without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivated by wanting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see what came before, I suspect that American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readers would give up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on The Stone Canal in the first hundred pages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>I hadn't heard of this book before.  It sounds quite
<br>
interesting to me.  :-)  I'll have to hunt it down...
