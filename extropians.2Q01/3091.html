Assume I was a complete fool (I probably am) and knew
<br>
very nearly nothing (I probably do).  Where would you
<br>
personally recommend starting out?
<br>
What I mean to say is, if a person walked in off of
<br>
the street and told you that they were to submit
<br>
themselves to you as your tool, in trust that you
<br>
would make of them a better person, what specifically
<br>
would you recommend to them as a course of study or
<br>
way of living?
<br>
Or, alternately, you can see me as something of the
<br>
person-in-the-street.  What would you tell an average
<br>
individual (other than &quot;Please jump in a ditch, the
<br>
rest of us are very busy.&quot;)?  I'm certain each of you
<br>
has different methods of living and different ways of
<br>
going about your day- I want to know, if it is
<br>
alright, whatever you are willing to tell me about
<br>
recommended reading, fitness programs, life-extension
<br>
programs, personal ways of doing, speaking, thinking,
<br>
and dealing with others.  I do not state that I
<br>
actually will turn myself over to you, by any means-
<br>
to entrust myself fully to anyone would almost
<br>
definitely be somewhat foolish, unless that person was
<br>
demonstratedly more devoted to my interests than even
<br>
I myself, but I will consider and examine whatever is
<br>
recommended to me.
