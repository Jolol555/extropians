<p><em>&gt; 	But then Dennett's claim: we don't have qualia &quot;It just seems

<em>&gt; this idea before him so that Fodor could make this criticism?
</em><br>
<p>Dennett is just the latest in a long string of folks of this kind.
<br>
<p>Skinner is probably the first and most well known proponent of a
<br>
theory like this, though most people today regard his theory to be
<br>
wildly flawed.  Hilary Putnam invented the philosophy of
<br>
functionalism; coupled with Alan Turing's work, one of the most
<br>
popular mental anti-realist views today is Turing-functionalism, the
<br>
view that X is conscious if X has the capacity to pass the Turing
<br>
Test.
<br>
<p>(Turing himself was influenced by the logical positivists like Ayer,
<br>
who regard non-empirical questions which aren't questions of pure
<br>
logic to be entirely meaningless.  Nobody likes logical positivism any
<br>
more either, as it is widely regarded as radically
<br>
self-contradictory.)
<br>
<p>Those are definitely amongst the most important names in the 20th
<br>
century.  To the best of my knowledge, Dennett hasn't really
<br>
contributed much to the philosophical field as such, except to the
<br>
extent that his work with Hofstadter and others on AI has formalized
<br>
physicalist answers to old mental realist objections.  As AI becomes a
<br>
richer and richer field, the views of Turing-functionalists and others
<br>
become increasingly plausible.
<br>
<p>Frege, who invented modern logic, had some really wacky views about
<br>
the philosophy of language, one of which was that ordinary sentences
<br>
had two parts to their meaning, one of which might be a real thing,
<br>
the other of which existed not in the mind or in the world but in a
<br>
&quot;third realm&quot; not unlike the realm of Plato's forms.  How did he get
<br>
people to believe this?  Well, by showing how useful his logic is, and
<br>
demonstrating how his philosophy of language could be used to settle
<br>
interesting puzzles in the analysis of reference.
<br>
<p>Dennett's doing something similar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sure not very good at history.  It's to bad such good ideas are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so easily lost or ignored by people such as Dennett...?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continually find that most of the Ideas I've had about consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many philosophers have had very close ideas to such as far back as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Descartes and earlier.  I just can't understand why so many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so easily dismiss, ignore, and more or less loose such great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and more of it isn't maintained in the popular press and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writings on this topic.  How can it be that all forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;representationalism&quot;, and it's implications, and ease of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining/predicting so many things, are so completely ignored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today?  It just blows my mind.
</em><br>
<p>Anyway, Dennett has NOT ignored representationalism.  Fodor and
<br>
Dennett have discussed these arguments *in person.* Go to his online
<br>
publications listing:
<br>
<p><a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/pubpage.htm">http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/pubpage.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I count at least three references to Fodor in article titles alone,
<br>
say nothing of further responses to Fodor in articles he's already
<br>
written.
<br>
<p>Here, read this, for example:
<br>
<p><a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/fodor2.htm">http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/fodor2.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Anyway, such objections as representationalism are in no way decisive
<br>
against Dennett's views about the mind.  Read Churchland's &quot;Matter and
<br>
Consciousness,&quot; which is on the extropian reading list.
