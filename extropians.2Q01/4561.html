Interesting that the time control elite was excised from

existence by Far Future folks who discovered their meddlings

before (see, here's the metatime thing again) they could extrude

their presence into their timeline (Harlan Ellison might

not be getting the new IP landscape, but he's partly excused 
<br>
by what he did), because their reality simulations deviated 
<br>
from reality, since not including external meddling. However, 
<br>
that particular universe did not have a very strong development 
<br>
vector, it was more or less a randomwalk. The Far Future guys 
<br>
who could wipe the Time Control Fashists just got lucky on the 
<br>
cosmic lottery. I don't think we're in a randomwalk, though.

universe instances in the Multiverse out there. Even given

</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's not completely clear to me what he's saying, but the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get out of this is as follows.  Suppose that you are climbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hill at a certain angle theta.  Then information from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future arrives which enables you to climb at theta+iota.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then since you are now on *that* slope, so to speak, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be receiving information from a more advanced future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The effect of that information will be to now place you on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theta+iota+iota slope, and so on, as long as you keep your machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receiving from the tangential future.  (The tangent space, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who know differential geometry, is a good metaphor here.)
</em><br>
<p>It's not completely clear to me what he's saying, but the idea
<br>
I get of this is similar to what I thought I've been saying, so
<br>
yes ;)
<br>
<p>The feedback I was thinking about was in fact a bit more malign.
<br>
It assumes Far Future to be a rather degenerate place, where
<br>
matter has been restructured to accomodate for maximum substrate.
<br>
Tigers and Lions. If you go back from that plateau, and assume 
<br>
continuous development, you've got a fitness gradient. Driven by 
<br>
it, the omega biota backpropagates through any open temporal 
<br>
gateway. Assume exporting a sample of current biosphere 100 MYears 
<br>
backwards. You've suddenly got a pocket of much fitter species, 
<br>
who walk all over their progenitors. Imagine a group of Rednecks 
<br>
with equipment stranding -3 MYears. Would we be then holding this 
<br>
discussion right now? Heck, no. No need to reach back thus far,
<br>
assume a bit more primate testosterone in the Cuba crisis, and
<br>
you wouldn't be reading this. No me, no you, probably no Internet
<br>
either, no computers, etc. Still people, but totally different
<br>
reality branch. Rather seedy reality branch, if you ask me, but
<br>
then, I'm not there.
<br>
<p>The Omega degenerate condition is by definition static, but it
<br>
is fit beyond your wildest imaginations, and so it totally wipes
<br>
anything which was so dumb as to open the channel into the future.
<br>
Think Neolithical types landing -200 megayears, or Mars Attacks 
<br>
types in medieval France, then multiply that by 10^9. Yes, it's 
<br>
that bad, and probably even worse.
<br>
<p>Assuming there are two overlapping temporal portals 
<br>
coexisting within each other's Blight impact radius 
<br>
(it's not lightcone, they're probably not *that* 
<br>
hardass, but not *too* far from it). So you've got 
<br>
Blight continue percolating back, until the very first 
<br>
such temporal channel has been opened (of course, one 
<br>
of the prime functions of the Blight is to turn the 
<br>
spacetime into swiss cheese, so that the biota can freely 
<br>
percolate back and forth). The Blight thus keeps pushing back 
<br>
its own horizont.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For the metaverse, this would have the following implication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligent life (i.e. life that is capable of devising and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profiting from the use of time travel devices) almost always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes off on an indescribable tangent (to badly mix metaphors).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, a Singularity is achieved in a way that we have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so far discussed very much.
</em><br>
<p>The Blight can't obviously (here's the proof: you're reading
<br>
this) open Interuniversal portals, at least not on their own, 
<br>
without us assisting them on our side. Assuming Blight exists, 
<br>
of course. Nevertheless, when people say &quot;hey, I think I found 
<br>
out a way to open a portal into the future which could
<br>
really work. Let's run off and do an experiment&quot; I wish they 
<br>
would consider far-out yarn as spun above.
<br>
<p>Of course, considered that the Blight has had ample experience
<br>
to overrun incrementally different cultures, it should be perfectly
<br>
capable of emulating a +15 min future. If that experiment
<br>
really works, you might be talking to the Devil, without even
<br>
figuring out whether the Devil exists, or not. Until you talk
<br>
to the Devil, and forfeit your soul, and anything else. On
<br>
the plus side, it will be probably so quick so it's not going
<br>
to hurt, so we could as well do it.
<br>
<p>Assuming the portal is traversable to matter, there's nothing 
<br>
to be done but to not to do the experiment. Assuming we got
<br>
lucky, and the portal can &quot;only&quot; propagate photonic pulses,
<br>
the first thing to do is to immediately end the experiment, and
<br>
never again to try the experiment. Fat chance.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, so much for paradoxes: they can be dealt with in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner that I have suggested, namely by an appeal to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse which (I think!) is indistinguishable from the
</em><br>
<p>There are a lot of contemporarily universes which are blighted.
<br>
Spacetime portals, if indeed are possible (fat chance) are Just
<br>
Not Your Average Star Trek Series.
<br>
<p>I'm overdoing it on purpose, but only because I think I do
<br>
have a point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; meta-time idea above.  (My reference to the 1937 Electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Handbook is taken from the marvelous old time travel short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story &quot;Other Tracks&quot;, which has inspired almost all my time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel ideas.)
</em><br>
<p>Sometime, people are going to read the archive, and to think
<br>
about what we right now think about medieval scholasts.
<br>
What an awful waste of human life.
