<!-- body="start" -->
<p>
A week from now, the Foresight Institute will be running
<br>
a big brainstorming session on the future (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.foresight.org/SrAssoc/spring2001/program.html">http://www.foresight.org/SrAssoc/spring2001/program.html</a>). 
<br>
There's no way I can be there, but I'm sure a number of
<br>
people on this list will be, so I'm going to say here 
<br>
what I'd like to have said there, and maybe it will make
<br>
its way there and make a difference. 
<br>
<p>My aim would be to get people to consider, as a serious
<br>
possibility, that the mind is essentially quantum in
<br>
some regard. This is not a wild contingency or an idle
<br>
speculation; it's only a few steps away from things we
<br>
already know, and if true it is likely to have profound
<br>
consequences for the shape of things to come. 
<br>
<p>First: We already know that quantum mechanics is a basic
<br>
feature of the world. We also have a rudimentary theory
<br>
of quantum computation, and a growing roster of
<br>
experimental achievements that involve quantum
<br>
information (creation of entangled states, quantum key 
<br>
distribution, quantum teleportation). To find that
<br>
some natural process essentially involves quantum
<br>
phenomena should not be surprising at all.
<br>
<p>Second: There are now several decades' worth of debate
<br>
over how one can understand thought or consciousness
<br>
in terms of computation. There is no consensus about
<br>
how to do this, and there are a number of outstanding
<br>
problems. For example:
<br>
<p>- Computational processes involve 'coarse-grained'
<br>
states of physical systems. But a multitude of
<br>
different coarse-grainings is possible for a given
<br>
physical system. If thought is a coarse-grained
<br>
neural computation, which one is it? Which coarse
<br>
graining is the 'real' one? 
<br>
<p>- Words have their meanings by convention, not
<br>
objectively or inherently. We have no evidence
<br>
that bit patterns in a computer are any different. 
<br>
For a computational state to represent something, 
<br>
it has to have a certain structure, but it doesn't
<br>
go the other way - the same structure can represent
<br>
different things. So if thoughts are computational
<br>
states, what feature determines their actual
<br>
referential content? What makes them 'about' anything? 
<br>
<p>- If thinking is algorithmic execution, does the
<br>
implementation matter? Could a Giant Look-Up Table
<br>
be conscious? 
<br>
<p>Third: It really is an open question as to whether
<br>
quantum coherence or quantum computation might 
<br>
occur in living matter. There is a well-known paper
<br>
(<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9907009">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9907009</a>) arguing
<br>
that mesoscopic quantum states would rapidly 
<br>
decohere under biological conditions; there is
<br>
another paper (<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0007020">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0007020</a>)
<br>
arguing that the first paper's argument does not
<br>
apply to quantum-*field* effects. The matter will
<br>
have to be decided by experiment, and biophysics
<br>
is still a young discipline. 
<br>
<p>I don't think that quantum computation per se is
<br>
any better at solving the problems in philosophy
<br>
of mind than classical computation. However, the
<br>
ground rules will be changed if quantum processes
<br>
are shown to be relevant to cognition, since the
<br>
novel ontological features of quantum theory (in
<br>
particular entanglement) thereby become potentially
<br>
relevant to ontology of mind. Wholly new approaches
<br>
will be opened up. I don't want to argue for a
<br>
a particular quantum theory of mind here, just that
<br>
it is a significant possibility that consciousness
<br>
is in some way intrinsically quantum-mechanical. 
<br>
<p>So what would be the consequences for the future? 
<br>
I don't know, this is precisely *why* I would like
<br>
to see serious futurists thinking about this. 
<br>
A new paradigm of mind would have to have a major
<br>
impact on human culture. And as far as technological
<br>
futurism is concerned, it seems that a quantum theory
<br>
of mind *must* have serious consequences for 
<br>
artificial intelligence, mind uploading, and perhaps 
<br>
cryonics. If thought and consciousness require 
<br>
quantum implementations, they can only truly occur 
<br>
in quantum AIs, and 'mind uploading' would have to 
<br>
be into quantum computers. Many of today's most
<br>
radical visions of a posthuman Mind Age would need
<br>
to be thoroughly rethought. 
<br>
<p>So, that's my message for Palo Alto. Thanks for
<br>
your attention.
