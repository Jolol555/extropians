<em>&gt; Now, as pointed out in the previous article I mentioned --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel041601.shtml">http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel041601.shtml</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it appears they are attempting to regulate cloning under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;interstate commerce&quot; powers granted to the Federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government by the constitution.  So it is questionable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the law would stand up to a court challenge.
</em><br>
<p>You'd think so, wouldn't you? But the Supreme Court has been quite inventive
<br>
in the past. Most research institutes are funded with money coming from more
<br>
than one state, and although this might have only an indirect effect on
<br>
commerce, I don't think that would necessarily stop the court from bringing
<br>
it under the commerce clause. (I always think of the case where a farmer who
<br>
was feeding his own home-grown grain to his own hogs was said to fall under
<br>
the commerce clause because by using his own grain he deprived the market of
<br>
the dollars he *would* have spent if he'd had to buy the grain). It's true
<br>
that lately the recent mood has been to interpret the commerce clause a bit
<br>
more strictly and to move away from federal control of state matters. In any
<br>
event, a law prohibiting the interstate sale of products resulting from
<br>
human cloning research and the possession of such products with intent to
<br>
sell could certainly put an effective damper on research even if the
<br>
research were not banned outright.
