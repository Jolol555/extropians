<p>
T.0. Morrow promoted a nice interesting philosophy (quasi-religion)
<br>
to the discussion for the framework in which to consider how to
<br>
run simulations, what you can do in them and how to &quot;hold&quot; the
<br>
simulation directors and producers.
<br>
<p>I'm not going to go into that because I'm not sure I understand it
<br>
well enough.
<br>
<p>However, his discussions sith Samantha placed side by side with
<br>
Eliezers Sysop discussions do raise some interesting issues.
<br>
<p>If we assume that extropian principles are those striving for
<br>
increasing complexity and sophistication (this may be vulnerable
<br>
to attack, but lets assume it for a minute) -- and *if* we assume
<br>
that conscious entities are inherently valuable and you cannot
<br>
infringe on their right to self-determine whether or not they should
<br>
continue to exist do we not have an inherent conflict?
<br>
<p>I.e. if you exhaust all the possibilities (read use up all the matter
<br>
to store the memory states of the all the conscious entities that have
<br>
ever been created and who cannot be destroyed) -- does not the moral position
<br>
that you &quot;cannot&quot; erase those states imply that you cannot fullfill the
<br>
extropian prime directive?
<br>
<p>The fundamental path through which evolution operates is to wipe the slate
<br>
sufficiently clean from time to time to allow it to go off in a completely
<br>
different direction.  This is not allowed in a &quot;moral&quot; SysOp world interested
<br>
in protecting everyone's &quot;self&quot;-interests.  (I doubt the SysOp has a
<br>
self-destruct sequence tied to on a random interval timers).
<br>
<p>Now, from an extropian perspective, you desire that the phase space be
<br>
explored as completely as is feasible.  Accepting that, you realize that
<br>
sooner or later your sim will have had its run and your bits are up for
<br>
reuse.  From a truly extropic perspective this is fine with you.
<br>
<p>Put another way, I think that Eliezer and Greg have a problem adhering
<br>
to extropic principles unless there is some very magic hand-waving
<br>
done on why &quot;extropians&quot; or &quot;SysOps&quot; would choose to limint the
<br>
phase space that can feasibly be explored.
<br>
<p>In short -- what do you do in the simulation where you get to the point
<br>
where you cannot explore any further without 'offing' someone against
<br>
their will?
<br>
<p>[Now there may be parts of the Extropian Principles that deal with this
<br>
(I haven't checked them), but it would seem to me that the consequence
<br>
of this is that what we are really discussing is &quot;Limited Extropianism&quot;
<br>
and not a consciously driven (read probably more efficient) full-blown
<br>
extropianism where you fully explore the phase space.)
<br>
<p>Note, there may be a form of &quot;moral&quot; extropianism where you explore
<br>
the phase space as fully as possible, but you do it with as little
<br>
&quot;pain &amp; suffering&quot; as possible.   This gets extraordinarily tricky
<br>
as for example would be the case where one want to determine whether
<br>
pain &amp; suffering can drive people to self-enlightenment such that
<br>
they realize pain is something that &quot;they&quot; have and can choose
<br>
to experience in a variety of ways.
