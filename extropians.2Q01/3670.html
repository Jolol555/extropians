Logic-based AI and self-organizing-emergence based-AI both have their
<br>
strengths and weaknesses.  To ignore the insights obtained by either
<br>
approach is a mistake.  The key is to figure out how they work together.
<br>
When you really get into it, the most abstract and complex logic-based tasks
<br>
come out to look VERY similar to the lowest-level perceptual processes....
<br>
The common substrate of processes underlying the two is more significant
<br>
than the differences, though the differences are real too.
<br>
<p>For instance, in the Webmind AI Engine, the hardest part of higher-order
<br>
inference is creating compound relations (boolean conjunctions of elementary
<br>
relations).  These are then evaluated and interrelated using inference
<br>
rules, but guessing which compound relations to form in a given context is a
<br>
hard problem not solved by logic, rather solved by evolution-like methods.
<br>
<p>Yet, this problem is very similar to recognizing patterns in a perceptual
<br>
stream -- where one is finding compound relations of elementary percepts
<br>
rather than elementary cognitive relations

<p><em>&gt; &gt; I was referring to the time when I read Elaine Rich,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hofstadter and Minsky, and all kinds of weird AI journals, and believed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their approach was not sterile. This was about 15 years ago. Then I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a bad case of cellular automata, complexity, resulting in processing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lots of dead tree labeled with Fredkin, Toffioli, Holland,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Koza, Kauffman,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wolfram, and their illustrous ilk. I still haven't recovered yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm looking for other infections material, but so far haven't found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much. Maybe I've become immune, that would be a pity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The GOFAI approach based on pure logic has been pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven sterile,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although there have been a few successes, such as (&quot;statistical&quot;) machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning, constraint logic programming.
