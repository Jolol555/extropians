<p><em>&gt; You probably need to run Buckytube cables around the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thing to provide the strength necessary to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; micrometeorite punctures and resist the pressures resulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from solar flares.  Lots of calculations to do here to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study the feasibility I suspect.
</em><br>
<p>It is also likely that we need to take active countrol into account. 
<br>
<p>A quick estimate: Solar flares produce an increase of solar output
<br>
around DL=3.83e-9 (based on
<br>
<a href="http://lepjas.gsfc.nasa.gov/~thorpe/thesis/chapter5.html">http://lepjas.gsfc.nasa.gov/~thorpe/thesis/chapter5.html</a>). This would
<br>
mean a change in force of DF=DL*L/(4 pi c r^2). Assuming the canonical
<br>
1 AU Dyson, I get DF=1.77e-14 N. Not much. But assuming that it pushes
<br>
over half the surface area of the dyson, I get 2.5e9 N total force,
<br>
which is 2.6e-3 N/m along the &quot;equator&quot;. Seems manageable.
<br>
<p>During a solar cycle the luminosity varies with at least 0.1%, but
<br>
this is isotropic. This is more serious: DF=4.66e-9 N, 263,000 times
<br>
more. This means the tension along a great circle would be 684
<br>
N. Still sounds within the realm of possibility to handle even using
<br>
current materials, although we need to make the cables very light for
<br>
the entire structure to act as a statite. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't like Ander's application of all of the mass in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar system to this application because it doesn't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.  (I also get about twice as much material as he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does to work with in the solar system -- something we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to resolve at some point...).
</em><br>
<p>We can always spend some time at Extro5 going through it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A principle you can try to work with is how do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the best use of the available energy with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smallest amount of material possible.  If you only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use a fraction of the available material for Jeff's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dyson *SPHERE* Lite, then Ander's can use the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it for building a Nutronomium-Brain (I forget what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls these).
</em><br>
<p>Jupiter brains, or ISOs. But I guess the different models will have
<br>
individual names. I suggested Ouranos, Zeus and Chronos, but in
<br>
reality they will be called Economy, DeLuxe, Business Edition etc :-)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now the question is what kind of a good computer architecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can you fit on top of a Dyson Shell Lite.  The one that comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mind for me is a 2-D cellular automata.  I.e. no 1-cm^3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rod-logic CPU's, instead you cover the surface with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very thin CPU's that only communicate with their nearest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbors.  Now, what kind of calculation that is good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know 
</em><br>
<p>Running extensive 2D partial differential equations? 
<br>
<p>I would suggest that connunications through the interior of the sphere
<br>
using laser would make it much more versatile. The delays are long,
<br>
but it would be able to run more like a small world network (2+1 D?).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lets try in the discussions to be careful with terms --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;shell&quot; would be lots of nested orbiting satellites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (like a Matrioshka Brain), a &quot;sphere&quot; would be a standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully contiguous surface.  These ideas have been misunderstood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for too long and its time to set them right.
</em><br>
<p>I agree! Maybe we should call this system of linked solar sails a
<br>
Dyson net?
