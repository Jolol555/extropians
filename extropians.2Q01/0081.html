NASA Ends Project Intended to Replace Shuttle
<br>
By WARREN E. LEARY
<br>
<p><p>WASHINGTON, March 1 — NASA today canceled the billion-dollar X-33 rocket 
<br>
project that the agency had once hoped would lead to a replacement for the 
<br>
space shuttle.
<br>
<p>Acknowledging that the five-year- old program would not lead to a viable 
<br>
rocket, the agency said the benefits of finally flying the long- delayed 
<br>
experimental prototype would not justify the costs. The National Aeronautics 
<br>
and Space Administration also announced that a smaller-scale program to 
<br>
build an airborne test bed for promising new rocket technology, called X-34, 
<br>
would be canceled because of rising costs.
<br>
<p>The programs were part of an effort to develop a reuseable launching vehicle 
<br>
that would operate more like an airplane, flying frequently, significantly 
<br>
cutting the cost of sending cargoes into space and improving safety.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge from these X- programs,&quot; 
<br>
Art Stephenson, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in 
<br>
Huntsville, Ala., said in a telephone news conference. &quot;But one of the 
<br>
things we have learned is that our technology has not yet advanced to a 
<br>
point that we can successfully develop a new reuseable launch vehicle that 
<br>
substantially improves safety, reliability and affordability.&quot;
<br>
<p>NASA said the X-33 program would end on March 31, when a cooperative 
<br>
agreement between the agency and the Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company 
<br>
expires, unless the company wished to continue alone. Evan McCollum, a 
<br>
spokesman for Lockheed, said that the company was disappointed in NASA's 
<br>
decision and that it was unlikely that Lockheed would continue the project.
<br>
<p>In 1996, NASA announced with great fanfare that it had selected the Lockheed 
<br>
X-33 design over two competing proposals to demonstrate technology for a 
<br>
privately built and owned rocket that would replace the shuttle and other 
<br>
rockets. The half- scale prototype was to have begun in 1999 suborbital test 
<br>
flights that would lead to a larger rocket, called Venturestar, that could 
<br>
have been operational six years later.
<br>
<p>Lockheed's design, the most technically advanced of the proposals, called 
<br>
for a rocket shaped like a flat arrowhead with fins at the bottom. The X-33 
<br>
was supposed to take off vertically with a new kind of nozzle- less rocket 
<br>
engine, re-enter the atmosphere protected by a novel kind of metallic 
<br>
thermal covering and land on a runway like an airplane.
<br>
<p>Technical problems, including rupture of a lightweight, composite material 
<br>
fuel tank, delayed test flights and drove up costs. Mr. Stephenson said NASA 
<br>
invested $912 million in the X-33 under a contract that froze the 
<br>
government's contribution, and Lockheed eventually spent $357 million, up 
<br>
from its original commitment of $212 million.
<br>
<p>Patricia A. Dasch, executive director of the National Space Society, a space 
<br>
advocacy group, said X-33 failed because NASA tried to do too much for too 
<br>
little money. &quot;NASA tried to do the impossible with the most technologically 
<br>
challenging proposal,&quot; Ms. Dasch said. &quot;It expected industry to bring more 
<br>
to the table, but the market was never proven and private investors were not 
<br>
interested.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Stephenson announced the end of the X-33 and X-34 programs when they 
<br>
failed to qualify for more money in the early rounds of the Space Launch 
<br>
Initiative, a five-year, $4.5 billion program begun last year that NASA 
<br>
hopes will lead to a second- generation rocket to replace the shuttle. NASA 
<br>
invested $205 million in the X-34 under a 1996 contract with the Orbital 
<br>
Sciences Corporation of Dulles, Va., to make a series of supersonic, 
<br>
air-launched robot craft to test new technologies. Mr. Stephenson said 
<br>
rising costs made this project noncompetitive.
