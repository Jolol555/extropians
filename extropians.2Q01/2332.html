<p>Useless, but not harmful.  Treat it as a game.  The real owners
<br>
of Mars will be the first ones to get there with some means of
<br>
persuading others to see things their way.  The first Martians will
<br>
not concern themselves with lawsuits happening on a faraway
<br>
planet.  This planet was settled by force, there is no reason to
<br>
believe that all the others will be settled by some other means,
<br>
regardless of the obvious benefits of doing by peaceful means.
<br>
<p>Actually you raise a point that is universal, for if humans manage
<br>
to acheive uploading, someone will try to control that finite new
<br>
territory too.  The first ones to get there have an enormous
<br>
advantage.  spike
