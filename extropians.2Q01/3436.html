</em><br>
<p><p>I would actually say that C is better than C++, mostly because C has a good
<br>
reason for existence, while C++ doesn't.  C++ is an ugly bastard of a
<br>
language that seems to have inherited the worst of all worlds.  C on the
<br>
other hand is arguably somewhat elegant and well-designed for what it is (a
<br>
universal assembly language).  Most of the problems occur when people use it
<br>
for more than this.  In practice, I often use the tiny subset of C++ that
<br>
actually offers an improvement over stock C, but not enough that I would
<br>
call the code &quot;C++&quot; (&quot;C+&quot; perhaps), as I refuse to use most of the paradigms
<br>
C++ supposedly offers.  My use of C++ is still completely procedural, which
<br>
is appropriate for what I would normally need to use C for.
