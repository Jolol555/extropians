</em><br>
<p>I've been wondering about that also, especially since they sent John Glenn
<br>
back up too.
<br>
<p>I'm not actually sure, though it could be that Tito went to the Russians and
<br>
that makes the NASA bureaucracy feel snubbed.  Perhaps this isn't on a
<br>
conscious level.  After all, NASA can offer all sorts of reasons not to send
<br>
anyone into space, but applying a particular excuse to a particular person
<br>
requires only some discomfort felt against that person.
<br>
<p>Thus, if NASA says Tito'll get in the way that could be applied to Glenn or
<br>
any political astronaut.  Also, if he will get in the way, why not have him
<br>
trained to do something -- if he isn't already scheduled to do more than
<br>
just loaf around?  Why opt immediately for a no go on Tito but a go on
<br>
Glenn?
<br>
<p>Another reason could be that NASA wants a certain image and that image does
<br>
not include having tourists onboard.  That kind of makes NASA look like
<br>
Disney.  Tarnishing this image of professionalism, of a serious space agency
<br>
might be more important than actually mainstreaming space flight.  Nor is it
<br>
worth it to NASA's leadership to change that in order to get new revenue
<br>
streams.  (Not that Tito's $20 million is going to fund any major NASA
<br>
program, but it's not an amount to sneeze at either, considering that most
<br>
NASA programs are only an order of magnitude more expensive than that.
<br>
E.g., the Odyssey just launched has, I believe, a budget of between $250
<br>
million and $300 million.)
<br>
<p>We must remember that NASA is a government agency, so it's incentives are
<br>
not those of maximizing profits or being economically efficient.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
