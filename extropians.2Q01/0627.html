<p>If they want to know more detail about their own history, in which
<br>
many people suspected they were living in a simulation, then they will
<br>
want to have a simulation in which many people suspect this as well.
<br>
Of course they don't want such people to have any proof, since their
<br>
own history didn't have any proof either, since it wasn't true then.
