<p><em>&gt; Where is the next Einstein?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3a9a59b12111.htm">http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3a9a59b12111.htm</a>

<em>&gt; Professor Lee Smolin, a visiting professor of physics at Imperial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; College in London, agrees that young people find it difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explore fresh topics because of the expectation that they will join
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large collaborative effort.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes!  This is so true!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you the perfect example of this - Steve Lehar's work on
<br>
consciousness.  Have any of you heard of him yet!?  You can read about
<br>
his work here:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/pub/slehar/Lehar.html">http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/pub/slehar/Lehar.html</a>
<br>
<p>and I have my own version of a draft of a paper supporting his theory
<br>
(I focus on the simple phenomenal qualities of this subjective world
<br>
and he focuses much more rigorously on its spatial qualities) here:

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish there was a real money Idea Futures out there, and one
<br>
of these days I'm going to create an idea futures entry on this.  I'll
<br>
bet anyone, anything (that I can afford), that by 2025, Steven Lehar
<br>
will be popularly viewed as contributing at least as much to science
<br>
as Einstein.  The implications of this theory to our immediate future
<br>
and to what we are is much more profound to us than what Einstein
<br>
theorized about.  But for some reason, no one will listen to or read,
<br>
let alone publish and argue for or even against, the profound plain
<br>
and simple logic and rational contained in these works.  It is very
<br>
frustrating and unbelievable to me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least Lawrence Elbaum Associates has finally agreed to
<br>
publish his book!  Perhaps now it will finally only be a few more
<br>
years before people finally understand the significance of what he is
<br>
saying about consciousness.  (Anyone want to bet!?)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, are there any AI people out there working on
<br>
representation and reasoning about visual 3D data?  I bet if you apply
<br>
some of Steven's models to an AI visual system, you'd fairly easily
<br>
get one mondo powerful system with near as much 3D visual common sense
<br>
awareness and intelligence as we have!  And I bet once this is
<br>
achieved more abstract general common sense, like we have, will soon
<br>
follow using similar models of information representation.  I'd love
<br>
to hear an expert on AI visual representations thoughts on such ideas.
<br>
For more detail see Steve's papers including: &quot;Computational
<br>
Implications of Gestalt Theory: The role of Feedback in Visual
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone willing to take me up on a bet!?  People don't seem
<br>
willing to read our papers.  Perhaps they will try to take our money
<br>
and make us rich!?
