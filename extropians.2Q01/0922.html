<p>
Robert,
<br>
<p>Those Google references refer to my writings and pages, the
<br>
most widely known are my wavelets pages.
<br>
<p>Wavelets are mostly a 'hobby' (although I find uses for them in my
<br>
work, and I wrote code and have earned some tiny money via wavelets).
<br>
I'm _not_ a wavelets researcher, nor a wavelets expert. I just
<br>
think that wavelets are neat.
<br>
<p>I wrote a paper to IEEE 6 years ago that was the result of teaching
<br>
myself the &quot;big picture&quot; about wavelets. Most references about
<br>
wavelets at that time were very mathematical and hard to follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From that 1995 paper, I made an HTML version and a postscript
</em><br>
version to download. At about the same time, I made a wavelets web
<br>
page (now expanded to three) that were my bookmarks from that
<br>
effort. One can consider all of that information:  &quot;Wavelets for
<br>
Beginners&quot;, because that's what I was, and I still think I am.
<br>
<p>Apparently I filled a niche of 'wavelets for beginners' information.
<br>
Since that time, about 100,000 people have downloaded my my wavelets
<br>
postscript paper, and about 3000 people a day visit my wavelets pages.
<br>
(<a href="http://www.amara.com/current/wavelet.html">http://www.amara.com/current/wavelet.html</a>)
<br>
<p>If you or anyone you know needs an intro wavelets seminar, let me know.
<br>
It's fun for me. The most fun I had was teaching wavelets in an all day
<br>
seminar to Alan Kay and Ted Kaehler and their Squeak group in July 1997.
<br>
Alan is one of the smartest people I've ever met, a funny guy, and he
<br>
has wonderful stories. I have put on this seminar enough times that's
<br>
it's easy for me, and doesn't require much effort. I don't do it very
<br>
often, but I have a  good set of lecture notes.
<br>
<p>So did we bet, and did I win the bet ??!!
<br>
<p>If so, then you can substitute something else for the bottle of
<br>
Pfalz wine. Things I can't get here like: Ziplock bags, Jif peanut
<br>
butter, a good Sunday big city American newspaper are each a good
<br>
substitute  !!  (I'm mostly joking with this bet stuff, however
<br>
I do think it's funny that you thought there was another me).
<br>
