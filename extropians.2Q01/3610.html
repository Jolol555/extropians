<p><em>&gt; Why do you care if they get nicer? They'll burn themselves out in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few millennia at the most, since they'll likely refuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life-extension tech and will be unable to keep their memes intact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over such a long time period.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are my friends and family.  My parrents are
<br>
getting old and could die any time.  That hurts!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolution sucks if you're the loser.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it sucks to lose loved ones (everyone) even if you are the
<br>
winner.  Sometimes I wonder if being militarrist about it would
<br>
justify the ends and being able to save the mentally ill people that
<br>
think they know what they want, when in reality they are grosely
<br>
mistaken.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some day (after millions of years?) we will become
<br>
true Gods, even with the ability to resurrect those that &quot;lost&quot; to
<br>
evolution and primative deathist memes.  I can emagine them comming to
<br>
after having been finally resurrected, realizing what they mist out on
<br>
for those milions of years, and being very mad at us for not being
<br>
more forcefull and insistant that they not make such stupid mistakes
<br>
as to no choose cryonic suspension...
