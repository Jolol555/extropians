This seems heartfelt but confused.

</em><br>
<p>Sorry, start over. Talking to people is a drug?

<p><em>&gt; I'm asking you to look at this as the transhumanists you strive to be, and not as the humane people you

<p>Can't have one without the other, as far as I'm concerned. There is considerable evidence, at least in mice, that SSRIs
<br>
and even lithium can actually promote new neuron growth. This implies the possibility of repair or rerouting of neural
<br>
pathways.
<br>
<p>Thinking-emoting-sensing is a function of the entire structure, brain and body, in strange loops inside and out.
<br>
<p>There appear to be two balanced areas, one in each hemisphere, relating to how OK things are perceived to be. I'm not
<br>
kidding; damage one area, and the other runs the show, apparently. Patients with the fretful region damaged have their
<br>
emotions caged and locked in &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot;, no-problems-here mode. And vice versa.
<br>
<p>So your question boils down to the reductionistic one: are we just stuff? Chemicals, cells, matter?
<br>
<p>I think &quot;we&quot;'re _patterns_.
<br>
<p>What did you want to be?
