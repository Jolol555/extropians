<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Immune system's role in cancer prevention reexplored
<br>
<p>Although this information comes as no surprise to alternative medicine
<br>
practitioners and adherents, medical research is rediscovering the immune
<br>
system's role in cancer prevention.   Prior to the 1970s, it was believed
<br>
that the body's immune system played a role in tumor prevention as well as
<br>
in the prevention of infection.   Research conducted during that decade
<br>
found that nude mice lacking lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell,
<br>
experienced the same amount of tumor development as normal mice, whether
<br>
these tumors were spontaneous or induced by carcinogens.  This led cancer
<br>
researchers to conclude that the immune system was ineffective in
<br>
preventing tumor formation.  It was later discovered that nude mice did
<br>
possess some lymphocytes.
<br>
<p>Research funded by the NIH and the Cancer Research Institute published in
<br>
the April 26 2001 issue of Nature discussed the results of several studies
<br>
conducted on mice which showed that lymphocytes and gamma interferon
<br>
produced by certain lymphocytes may be important in preventing tumors.  In
<br>
one experiment, mice bred to lack any functional lymphocytes through the
<br>
inactivation of a lymphocyte-specific gene, RAG2, were injected with MCA,
<br>
a carcinogen.  Sixty percent of these mice developed tumors, compared to
<br>
13% of a control group of mice who received the carcinogen.  The mice
<br>
lacking lymphocytes also developed the tumors earlier than the controls.
<br>
Two additional studies confirmed these results.  In a previous experiment,
<br>
mice bred to lack the receptor for interferon or one of the proteins
<br>
necessary for the functioning of the interferon receptor (Stat1) received
<br>
MCA with similar results.  When the researchers bred mice lacking the
<br>
genes for both RAG2 and Stat1, the tumor incidence was not significantly
<br>
greater than the tumor incidence occurring in mice that lacked one gene or
<br>
the other.  Therefore lymphocytes and the interferon receptor may have
<br>
overlapping roles in tumor prevention.
<br>
<p>Additionally, genetically modified mice lacking the ability to both form
<br>
both lymphocytes and to possess proper interferon receptor functioning
<br>
were shown to develop cancer spontaneously without the administration of a
<br>
carcinogen, with all of them developing tumors, half of them cancerous.
<br>
Only two out of eleven controls developed tumors during the course of the
<br>
study, both nonmalignant.
<br>
<p>Robert D Schreiber, PhD, Alumni Professor of Pathology and Immunology and
<br>
Professor of Molecular Microbiology at Washington University School of
<br>
Medicine, who led the study, stated, &quot;We think the two are potentially
<br>
part of the same mechanism but represent different steps in the process.
<br>
Interferon makes tumor cells expose themselves to the immune system. After
<br>
seeing the abnormal proteins in the tumor, the lymphocytes eliminate the
<br>
tumor cells . . . These results show that both interferon and lymphocytes
<br>
are involved in the prevention of tumors and that the two interact with
<br>
one another to protect individuals from cancer development.&quot;
<br>
<p>Because some tumors that escape immune detection lack a protein called
<br>
TAP1, the researchers tagged highly aggressive tumors with the protein
<br>
before transplanting them into healthy mice and mice lacking lymphocytes.
<br>
The healthy mice rejected the tumors, while the lymphocyte-deficient mice
<br>
did not, showing that the immune system was responsible for eliminating
<br>
them.  Dr Schreiber commented, &quot;We think that tagged tumor could be used
<br>
to train the immune system to reject others like it. This is very exciting
<br>
because it indicates that immunotherapy has a significant potential use.&quot;
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Vitamin A augments interferon in human cells
<br>
<p>Research conducted at Penn State University has revealed that the active
<br>
form of vitamin A plays a role in immune response by enhancing the effect
<br>
of interferon. Interferon is an immune system regulator and one of the
<br>
body's defense chemicals.
<br>
<p>Modified forms of interferon are used to treat autoimmune diseases such as
<br>
multiple sclerosis, arthritis and chronic inflammation, and maintaining
<br>
adequate vitamin A levels may enhance the effectiveness of these forms of
<br>
interferon. In the research reported at the Experimental Biology 2001
<br>
conference in Orlando Florida this week, human macrophages, which are
<br>
immune system cells that mediate the inflammatory response and also lead
<br>
to antibody production, were stimulated in the presence of sufficient
<br>
vitamin and in vitamin A deficient conditions. Vitamin A led to increased
<br>
interferon activity.
<br>
<p>Research team leader Dr. Catharine Ross, of Penn State's College of Health
<br>
and Human Development, commented, &quot;There are quite a few animal studies
<br>
that show that vitamin A deficiency affects inflammation and the immune
<br>
system's response. These new data from experiments with human cells
<br>
suggest that vitamin A augments natural interferon's regulatory response.
<br>
Less interferon may be necessary when the active form of vitamin A is
<br>
adequate.&quot;

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Immune Enhancement
<br>
<p>The Life Extension Foundation's Immune Enhancement protocol is designed to
<br>
enhance immune function in aging patients, in patients receiving cancer
<br>
chemotherapy, and in those suffering from chronic viral or bacterial
<br>
infections.
<br>
<p>Free radicals have been linked to immune system damage that accompanies
<br>
normal aging. A strong immune system is critical to the prevention of
<br>
infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. It is thought that cancer cells
<br>
form regularly, and that a vigilant immune response is therefore required
<br>
to kill or deactivate these deformed cells before they become malignant
<br>
tumors. Members of the Life Extension Foundation have long been encouraged
<br>
to follow a daily antioxidant regimen that protects against
<br>
immune-suppressing free radicals.
<br>
<p>The incidence of cancer and new infectious diseases increases every year
<br>
in the United States. In addition, many dangerous bacteria have become
<br>
resistant to the antibiotics that once kept them in check. These virulent,
<br>
antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are increasingly becoming a
<br>
threat to our lives. There is strong scientific evidence showing that
<br>
antioxidants and other natural therapies can play an important role in
<br>
maintaining and enhancing immune function.
<br>
<p>The trace element zinc has many roles in basic cellular function. These
<br>
include DNA replication, RNA transcription, cell division, and cell
<br>
activation. Zinc also functions as an antioxidant and stabilizes
<br>
membranes. Zinc-deficient patients display reduced resistance to
<br>
infection. Zinc's importance in many aspects of the immune system-from
<br>
skin barrier to lymphocyte gene regulation-may be based on its importance
<br>
in cellular function. Zinc is also needed for the normal development and
<br>
function of the cells which mediate nonspecific immunity (such as
<br>
neutrophils and natural killer cells). Zinc deficiency is known to enhance
<br>
the development of acquired immunity by preventing the outgrowth of and
<br>
certain functions of T-lymphocytes such as activation, cytokine
<br>
production, and B-lymphocyte help.
<br>
Immune dysfunction and susceptibility to infection have been observed in
<br>
zinc-deficient human subjects. A study investigated the production of
<br>
cytokines and characterized the T-cell subpopulations in three groups of
<br>
mildly zinc-deficient subjects. These included head and neck cancer
<br>
patients, healthy volunteers found to have a dietary deficiency of zinc,
<br>
and healthy volunteers in whom a zinc deficiency was induced by dietary
<br>
means.  The study demonstrated that zinc status affects cytokine levels.
<br>
Production of interleukin-2 and gamma-interferon was decreased even when
<br>
the zinc deficiency was mild. Natural killer cell activity was also
<br>
decreased in zinc-deficient subjects. T-cell formation was decreased even
<br>
in mildly zinc-deficient subjects. The study demonstrates the crucial role
<br>
of zinc in promoting specific immune responses.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>OptiZinc
<br>
<p>Zinc is a mineral necessary for the formation of superoxide dismutase, one
<br>
of the body's free radical scavengers. It also promotes wound healing,
<br>
immune function, taste sensitivity, is necessary for protein synthesis,
<br>
assists in the formation of insulin and is important for the development
<br>
of all reproductive organs. OptiZinctm is the most bioavailable form of
<br>
zinc. The number of capsules you take depends on the amount of zinc in
<br>
your multinutrient formula. Most people's intake of zinc should not exceed
<br>
90 mg per day.

<p>Life Extension Mix
<br>
<p>Life Extension Mix is an antioxidant formula that affords a considerable
<br>
degree of protection against free radicals. In addition, Life Extension
<br>
mix includes nutrients that: enhance methylation (an essential process
<br>
that declines during aging); inhibit glycosylation (a significant cause of
<br>
aging damage); suppress apolipoprotein serum levels (a cause of
<br>
atherosclerosis); suppress homocysteine serum levels ( a cause of
<br>
cardiovascular disease); suppress mitochondrial oxidative stress (a cause
<br>
of premature aging); protect against thrombosis (abnormal blood clotting
<br>
inside arteries); maintain microcapillary perfusion; and protect against
<br>
DNA mutations that lead to certain cancers.

Lactoferrin Update by Will Brink
<br>
<p>Readers of Life Extension magazine expect the latest research on natural
<br>
non-toxic supplements that prevent disease and improve health. A
<br>
lactoferrin update is therefore in order. Lactoferrin has captured the
<br>
interest of many researchers as a natural compound with a wide variety of
<br>
uses. What follows is a summary of previously published information on the
<br>
research and effects of lactoferrin followed by some of the more
<br>
up-to-date studies.
<br>
<p>Lactoferrin appears to be a subfraction of whey with the best documented
<br>
anti-viral, antimicrobial, anticancer and immune modulating/enhancing
<br>
effects. When we talk about whey we are actually referring to a complex
<br>
protein made up of many smaller protein subfractions (peptides). Many of
<br>
these subfractions are only found in very minute amounts in cows' milk,
<br>
normally at less than 1%. For example, lactoferrin makes up only 0.5% to
<br>
1% or less of whey protein derived from cows' milk. Mothers' milk, on the
<br>
other hand, will contain up to 15% lactoferrin.
<br>
<p>Lactoferrin is found throughout the human body and occurs in all
<br>
secretions that bathe mucous membranes such as saliva, tears, bronchial
<br>
and nasal secretions, hepatic bile, pancreatic fluids, and is an essential
<br>
factor in the immune response. Lactoferrin is concentrated in oral
<br>
cavities where it will come in direct contact with pathogens (i.e.
<br>
viruses, bacteria, etc.) and kills or greatly suppresses these pathogens
<br>
through a variety of different mechanisms. In fact, there are specific
<br>
receptors for lactoferrin found on many key immune cells, such as
<br>
lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages, and is known to be directly
<br>
involved in the upregulation of natural killer (NK) cell activity.
