Re: the recent wash of cloning news.
<br>
&nbsp;Boy if I still smoked I'd make a big cup of coffee and light a cuban
<br>
in satisfaction. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of news only reinforces my determination to
<br>
have the sort of family I really want, rather than settling
<br>
for the standard model.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twins I think. Yeah.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twins.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy I have a lot to do yet. lololol
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which raises an interesting issue (and I invite comment
<br>
from the ladies as well)
<br>
&nbsp;What does it do to the psychology of the privileged
<br>
male to be able to fundamentally and completely
<br>
divorce the reproductive functions of the female
<br>
from the emotional/sexual portions of the usual
<br>
male/female dynamic...
<br>
&nbsp;without in any way sacrificing the father's own
<br>
genetic continuity?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance...
<br>
&nbsp;A certain sort of female I find sexually attractive...
<br>
this type seldom overlaps with the type I 
<br>
would prefer to mingle genes with.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these types is usually congruent with
<br>
the ideal for child-bearing (in a gestational sense)
<br>
and often (for a variety of reasons) for 
<br>
the &quot;nurture/caregiver&quot; role as well.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;bon vivant waif&quot; of lust is not (usually) the neurosurgeon
<br>
or physicist whose genes are ideal. The girl genius
<br>
usually has a career, not ideal for a full time mom 
<br>
(understandably so).  The fashion plate often has
<br>
baggage.
<br>
&nbsp;But when the professional male can pick a womb
<br>
and a nanny (possibly in the same body) without
<br>
choosing a bedmate or a genetic mother in the same
<br>
package.....
<br>
&nbsp;How does THIS change the game?
<br>
&nbsp;Doesn't it seem consistent with the paring down
<br>
of family size, paring down from tribe, to extended
<br>
family, to nuclear family....?
<br>
&nbsp;What comes after the nuclear family?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
sometimes life is so damn cool!
