<p>I dunno, all solar systems are roughly alike. A seed does not to be
<br>
ultraintelligent, in fact it doesn't need to be intelligent at all. It
<br>
will absolutely suffice for it to generate intelligence, using local
<br>
resources. I'm not sure how small the seed can get, but given enough time
<br>
even the meekest self-replicator will do.

<p><em>&gt; The only way you send information is by encoding it in matter

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>So you don't send it at 0.9999999 c but at 0.95 c, or something.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also can't send matter at a speed even close to the speed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; interstellar hydrogen ablates your data &quot;package&quot; so by the time
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't think that's right. If you go fast enough, it only means that
<br>
you're bathing in radiation, the harder, the faster your are. This means
<br>
you have to have a metabolism, and repair the damage incrementally using
<br>
distributed encoding (within the packet, and between the packets).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The rest of the discussion just gets worse...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This points out that Kurzweil hasn't been reading our archives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or doing proper net searches (otherwise he certainly would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run accross the discussions about the Matrioshka Brains).  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part that doesn't make any sense is that he was at the start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my discussion at the Spring '99 Foresight SA meeting where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I discussed the fundamental limits on intelligence.  So he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *should* be aware of the concepts and not be going off into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flights of fantasy regarding worm-hole travel (No MAGIC PHYSICS!).
</em><br>
<p>Why do you expect Kurzweil to be omniscient, or only rational?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I believe I've pointed out several times in various forums,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced civilizations don't want to expand their size scales
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want to shrink them.  Moravec's muon-onium or Ander's
</em><br>
<p>Sure they want to go compact, but this doesn't mean they're not going to
<br>
spawn off clones (which in their turn will go compact, if that's
<br>
possible).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Neutronium are the way to go (if they can be done without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magic physics).
