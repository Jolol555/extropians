<em>&gt; &gt;Hopefully the fallacy here is clear: the advantage of trade is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that it allows people in different areas to specialize in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;different things. This is more efficient and less wasteful than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;trying to do everything locally.  The wider the range of talents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and resources available, the greater are the opportunities for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;finding the best possible match of people and production.  Trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on a worldwide basis maximizes available resources for everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never said anything against trade, and the things you said above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only apply to FAIR trade. Exporting manufacturing offshore to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places that have little or no effective protection for the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen is bad for everyone involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sweatshops are wrong no matter where they are located.
</em><br>
<p>Its funny, when the jobs being exported were resource recovery jobs,
<br>
like mining, agriculture, lumber, etc, there was not such a big hew and
<br>
cry from the unions, since cheap resources meant more manufacturing jobs
<br>
and higher pay for those manufacturing jobs. The unions are stuck now,
<br>
because now the third world is developing, and they are developing
<br>
manufacturing base that is cutting into their core membership, while the
<br>
unions are finding it difficult to migrate into the info-worker market,
<br>
since info-workers tend to be far more informed, intelligent, educated,
<br>
and independent minded than manufacturing laborers, and the info-labor
<br>
market is a sellers market, where manufacturing-labor was a buyer's
<br>
market for decades due to high immigration. We don't need unions to make
<br>
good money in high-tech. So, consequently, the unions are doing anything
<br>
they can to make it more difficult to ship more manufacturing jobs
<br>
overseas.
<br>
<p>It's unfortunate for them that manufacturing robots are not intelligent,
<br>
otherwise the unions would look to them for membership... ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The most efficient system is one where you buy the goods that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cheapest, regardless of where they are produced.  Anything else is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;just throwing money away.  You're hurting yourself and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;around you by boycotting trade opportunities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not where they are produced, it's HOW they are produced, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sweatshop products are harmfull to humanity at any price, no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how low.
</em><br>
<p>Every nation's industry must go through a sweatshop phase to develop,
<br>
and frankly, the majority of the charges you hear about 'sweatshops' is
<br>
bogus spin doctoring by unions and other labor agitators.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have nothing against products from other places, in fact my most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prized possession is my Swiss army knife, and pocket watch. (okay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and my gold Waltham 1867 pocket watch and Dunhill lighter)
</em><br>
<p>Mine is my Acer laptop, made in a high-tech southeast asian sweatshop,
<br>
refurbed in Boston by immigrants, and which cost me a fraction of
<br>
retail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am arguing that a country should maintain core competencies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basics of life, it should grow as much of it's own food as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible (and economical), it should produce much of it's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothing.
</em><br>
<p>Nah, efficient resource utilization (to prevent malthusian meltdown
<br>
prior to the singularity) demands maximizing comparative advantage.
<br>
Family run dairy farms in Vermont are cute and fun for the tourists, but
<br>
frankly, I don't give a crap where my milk came from, so long as it's
<br>
not diseased and it's as cheap as possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exploiting third world labor to try to maintain our lifestyles is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently bad for us.
</em><br>
<p>Please explain why...
