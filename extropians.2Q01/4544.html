<p>
Mitch, Hal, and Eugene keep coming dangerously close to a full
<br>
discussion of SF level time travel, paradoxes and all.
<br>
<p>Is there anyone on this list who has not at some time or other
<br>
personally tried to work out a theory of time travel that
<br>
would resolve, or escape from, the paradoxes?
<br>
<p>One idea I had turns out (so I like to think) isomorphic to
<br>
what David Deutsch suggests!  First, DD wrote an article in
<br>
Scientific American five or six years back that purported to
<br>
describe how time travel would really work.  You can't imagine
<br>
my anticipation of reading that, only to be rather disappointed.
<br>
It seemed that DD was saying that --- well, you know how anything
<br>
can happen in the multiverse?  E.g., your keyboard could suddenly
<br>
turn into a brown rabbit, because there is a small amplitude in
<br>
QM for just such a transformation? --- he was saying, or so it
<br>
seemed to to me, that the appearance of a time traveler from 
<br>
the future was exactly such a miraculous transformation.  How
<br>
dull.
<br>
<p>But I always have to read Deutsch twice to appreciate him.  In 
<br>
&quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; he devotes an entire chapter to time
<br>
travel!  And he's right on the money (as we Americans say),
<br>
merely fleshing out his earlier SA article.
<br>
<p>But here was my idea from many years ago:  suppose (to make
<br>
the paradox simpler) we have a Contrarian.  This person will
<br>
always say &quot;Yes&quot; if he is supposed to say &quot;No&quot; and vice-verse.
<br>
The Contrarian receives information from the future that he
<br>
is about to say &quot;Yes&quot;, so naturally he says &quot;No&quot;.  Well, then
<br>
after he writes down his answer somewhere, and some time travel
<br>
apparatus gets hold of it, it's now the &quot;No&quot; answer that flies
<br>
backwards in time.  This time, the past Contrarian is presented
<br>
with the &quot;He said No&quot; information, and so says &quot;Yes&quot;.  Then,
<br>
later, when **his** information is written down and then used
<br>
by the time travel apparatus, the cycle repeats.
<br>
<p>As you have already probably guessed, this picture involves
<br>
a sort of meta-time.  (You should properly have gagged at a
<br>
number of the &quot;this time's&quot; and &quot;later's&quot; that I used in
<br>
that paragraph.)  Now then, we mark the &quot;nth&quot; instance of the
<br>
information going backwards in time, and then the &quot;n+1th&quot;
<br>
instance and so on, where n and n+1 are elements of a non-
<br>
well-ordered set (so that there is no starting element).
<br>
But it gives rise to an ensemble-type picture:  you look
<br>
at these two paths and see them both happening infinitely
<br>
many times, but identically each time, which really amounts
<br>
to them just happening once each (under a certain interpretation).
<br>
<p>The more elaborate paradoxes are handled similarly.  You kill
<br>
your grandfather, and then aren't born in the next &quot;run&quot;, but
<br>
then history is different, someone else gets the time machine,
<br>
then kills his grandfather (or sends the 1937 Electrical 
<br>
Engineering Handbook back to 1837), and a different history
<br>
happens, and then a different history happens, and then...
<br>
some large but finite number of times, until you are born
<br>
once more, and the entire cycle repeats.
<br>
<p>But so far as I can make out, this is what David Deutsch is
<br>
in effect saying.  If you &quot;go back in time&quot; you are going to
<br>
a different branch of the multiverse, that's all.  (The
<br>
multiverse is a continuum, so it would lack my finite recursion
<br>
property that I used for illustration above, but that isn't
<br>
essential.)
<br>
<p>Eugene wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...you've got a loop of Final Cause (the Antipode of the First 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Cause) keeping reaching back, and restructuring the timeline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iteratively.  Not only is this bootstrap, this is autofeedback.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The capabilities are nudged backwards with each increment. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial kinetics dynamics is limited, but I have no idea how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited.  Even if you're getting back &quot;only&quot; information, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be very surprised what you might be getting back from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scant few hours into the future. 
</em><br>
<p>It's not completely clear to me what he's saying, but the idea
<br>
I get out of this is as follows.  Suppose that you are climbing
<br>
a hill at a certain angle theta.  Then information from the 
<br>
future arrives which enables you to climb at theta+iota.  But
<br>
then since you are now on *that* slope, so to speak, you are
<br>
going to be receiving information from a more advanced future.
<br>
The effect of that information will be to now place you on a
<br>
theta+iota+iota slope, and so on, as long as you keep your machine
<br>
receiving from the tangential future.  (The tangent space, for
<br>
those who know differential geometry, is a good metaphor here.)
<br>
<p>For the metaverse, this would have the following implication.
<br>
Intelligent life (i.e. life that is capable of devising and
<br>
profiting from the use of time travel devices) almost always
<br>
goes off on an indescribable tangent (to badly mix metaphors).
<br>
That is, a Singularity is achieved in a way that we have not
<br>
so far discussed very much.
<br>
<p>Anyway, so much for paradoxes: they can be dealt with in the
<br>
manner that I have suggested, namely by an appeal to the
<br>
multiverse which (I think!) is indistinguishable from the
<br>
meta-time idea above.  (My reference to the 1937 Electrical
<br>
Handbook is taken from the marvelous old time travel short
<br>
story &quot;Other Tracks&quot;, which has inspired almost all my time
<br>
travel ideas.)
