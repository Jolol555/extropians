<em>&gt;From &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20TECH:%20Re:%20Telephones%20&amp;%20DSL:%20Can%20we%20lose%20the%20phone?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200103221523.HAA20130@well.com&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;In one of my rare introspective moments, I was thinking to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;myself today, how I so rarely get phone calls that I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably turn off my telephone service and not notice it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then it occurred to me that I've got a long-distance e-phone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call-out capability (with some vendor I can't remember the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;name of, who may no longer be in business...).  I've also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;got an eFax account for incoming faxes.  All I'm missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is an eFax type &quot;voice&quot; supplier so that people could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call me over my DSL connection.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Now I think the USB-computer telephones are running a couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of hundred dollars, but the implication is that I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completely cancel my telephone lines and use virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;telephone numbers instead.  The savings in telco billing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should pay for the cost of a handset in a year or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(a remarkably fast payoff for a technology transition).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, if people move to this en-mass is the phone company going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;wise up&quot; and insist that you pay for voice service on any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DSL connection?  Will the telephone company &quot;disconnect&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your DSL line if you close your voice line? (Are these policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already spelled out or will they be determined by letters to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commission overseeing the Telco and potentially lawsuits?).
</em><br>
<p>Disclaimer: My opinions are my own, I do not speak for
<br>
SBC/Ameritech or any of it's partners/associates.
<br>
<p>The future is out on DSL. Here in Illinois, the Illinois Commerce
<br>
Commission recently ruled DSL as a mere extension of existing POT's
<br>
service and said all provisions of the '96 telecom act applied. The
<br>
regional carrier (us) disagrees strongly, saying DSL is a new
<br>
service and not subject to the Telecom act, as a result, we have
<br>
currently suspended all new DSL facilities here in Illinois.
<br>
<p>Essentially under the current agreement anybody can buy your
<br>
account from Ameritech for 20% less than we charge ourselves for
<br>
the same service, in other words at a loss to us. The original idea
<br>
was that when there was sufficient market penetration by so-called
<br>
competitors, we would be allowed into long distance.
<br>
<p>As everyone knows, this has never happened. Hundreds of competitors
<br>
have entered the local loop, but are only interested in business
<br>
services, where the money is. All those who lobbied for this access
<br>
knew this in advance, the public was sold a bill of goods.
<br>
<p>Obviously we have no intentions of providing DSL service at a loss.
<br>
Most of the so-called competitors don't even own any DSL equipment,
<br>
they rent it from us, as provided by law.
<br>
<p>Well, now the telecom act is about to sunset and the mad scramble
<br>
is on to see what comes next.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;A related question would be does anyone understand IPv6
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficiently to tell me how I can get my house allocated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a permanent block of numbers and lean on the Telco to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stop charging me for my block of fixed internet addresses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(something they seem to be playing the &quot;buy&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;bump-the-price&quot; game with).
</em><br>
<p>Robert, I don't know where you live, but in my area and I'm pretty
<br>
sure in the whole U.S., we (the RBOC's) do not currently use IPv6,
<br>
therefore it is unsupported.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, for the prediction-oriented out there.  Clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at some point, it should become feasible for a company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to assemble an electronic box (probably a couple of chips)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that does Ipv6 routing over frequencies anyone has access
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to for free.  If you get the frequency hopping algorithms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct, everyone should be able to put a world &quot;router&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in their house.  So for the up-front cost plus the electricity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to run it you should have access to the local &quot;hub&quot; for free.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with routers is of course routing tables and how to
<br>
update them (what happens when a route is lost?). This very soon
<br>
completely overwhelms a software based router, which is why routers
<br>
and networks are built in hierarchical networks running various
<br>
protocols, then connected to the Internet routers with Border
<br>
Gateway Protocol.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I.e. no telco bill (obviously this buries the telcos
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as we know them).  The barriers to this are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the design, the limited market (once everyone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one they are unlikely to buy two), and the need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get &quot;sufficient&quot; mass in cities (1 house per block?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However you could develop a B-plan where you give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away 1/block and sell to all the other people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the block to access it.
</em><br>
<p>Who's going to build and maintain the network on which this all
<br>
runs?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Under this scheme, you pay some monthly fee to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inter-city hub traffic carrier (you pick the amount).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They route your messages strictly on a priority basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based on how much you are paying per message unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(In other words, you gets what you pay for.)  Presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have to build the net so that traffic of the highest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paying customers gets routed responsively at peak times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you choose to communicate at the &quot;off-peak&quot; times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you reap the benefits of the people willing to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;big bucks&quot;.  Now the interesting thing about this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that it becomes &quot;self-balancing&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Self balancing how, because someone else has built in all the very
<br>
necessary backups to this?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Related to this would be an interesting P2P concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where cell phones become routers.  If everyone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a C.P. why do you need the base stations?  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obviously need the B.S. for interstate calls, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps not for local calls (which are presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the majority).  [Of course there is a battery/electricity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost to using your phone as a router, but can you provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an accounting for this.  I.e. when you leave your C.P. in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the charger so it can serve as a local router, you accumulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call time that is deducted when you actually use the phone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It becomes quite interesting that people might actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;derive an income from sticking their C.P. routers in critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intercity locations so you capture some fraction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revenue that would otherwise run over the optical links.
</em><br>
<p>As I pointed out this involves a very simplistic idea of routers
<br>
and what they do, but don't take my word, visit www.cisco.com and
<br>
see for yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As Harper, from Andromeda (<a href="http://www.andromedatv.com/">http://www.andromedatv.com/</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might say -- &quot;Am I not a genius?&quot;  (or am I simply so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stupid that there are a dozen companies working on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as I type these words and I'm simply unaware of it?)
</em><br>
<p>You are a genius! And yes there are hundreds of companies working
<br>
on some of these same ideas.
<br>
<p>In 1991 I was involved with Project Lightwave, the stated purpose
<br>
of which was to have fiber to the home/business at every Ameritech
<br>
location by the year 2000. Then the long-distance carriers, the
<br>
interexchange carriers, the cable companies, groups like CUB
<br>
(citizens utility board) and the local commerce commissions got
<br>
involved, and when they were finished regulating, the whole plan
<br>
had to be scrapped.
<br>
<p>Read that again, if it weren't for the actions of these groups, you
<br>
would already have fiber to the home.
<br>
<p>The best thing that could happen for us the consumer as far as
<br>
telephone rates is this, let the RBOC's do long distance. Telephony
<br>
is already a commodity and the only thing keeping the whole thing
<br>
from collapsing into a lowest denominator flat rate service is the
<br>
artificial separation of local/long distance.
<br>
<p>Your mouths would water if you could see the plans for our next
<br>
generation network sitting on my desk right now, all optical, fully
<br>
meshed terabyte scalable to pentabyte nodes..... beautifull, and we
<br>
could start building tomorrow, but will we ever get the chance?
<br>
<p>Why would we build such a network if all we are allowed to do is
<br>
local telephone service?
