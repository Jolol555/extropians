<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 7 Months I have found what appears for me at least a cure 
<br>
for depression and seasonal affective disorder.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have suffered from Depression since around puberty and come from a long 
<br>
line of naturally very depressed peolple. Virtually every memeber of my 
<br>
family has suffered at some time or another.        
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took many years to realise that I was also suffering from Season 
<br>
Affective Disorder, Which manifeted itself with a pattern of deepening 
<br>
depression starting around September and ending around February/ March. This 
<br>
usually coinsided with me having severe work troubles or in extreme cases, 
<br>
loosing my job or during the darker months. As with many people with 
<br>
depression I have usually been unaware that I am becoming depressed until im 
<br>
truely in a hole.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen several different Doctors over the years for help and 
<br>
recieved Traquilisers, Anti depresants etc etc and also had some quality 
<br>
advise along the lines of &quot;If it hurts, don't do it&quot; and &quot;Stop wasting my 
<br>
time, NEXT&quot;.
<br>
I spent a year on Prozac, but that wasn't alot of fun and generally I feel 
<br>
that although it did help the depression, I spent a whole year as someone 
<br>
else.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 7 months ago during an everyday conversation with a workmate, she 
<br>
mentioned that she had been taking Flax seed oil tablet to help alieviate 
<br>
mild rumatism. I have also long been suffering with neck trouble and thought 
<br>
i'd give it a go. I read up about it on the web and bought some capsules from 
<br>
the chemist.
<br>
The label recomended 2 capsules per day but most of the information I had 
<br>
read stated twice that, so I started taking 4 per day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a week I had started to notice a change, but not in my neck. I was 
<br>
feeling generally a lot &quot;better&quot;. It was hard to put my finger on exactly 
<br>
what it was but I was just feeling good. This continued for around 3 weeks 
<br>
when I stopped taking the capsules. This wasn't for any reason, I actually 
<br>
just forgot to take them. Again within around a week I was feeling different, 
<br>
this time I was aware that I was stating to become depressed. It was the end 
<br>
of september and the days were getting shorter. I stayed off the Flax seed 
<br>
for another week as my depression grew. Then I started them again and sure 
<br>
enough after a week I was feeling better. The penny hadn't quite dropped but 
<br>
I had noticed that was being more assertive at work and generally things were 
<br>
going ok. I spoke to the workmate that had recomended flax and she agreed 
<br>
that they not only helped her rumatism but also perked her up and she was 
<br>
also more assertive. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continued to take the capsules throughout the winter and havent 
<br>
suffered 1 single day of deppression despite having various family woes that 
<br>
would normally bring me down a peg or two. I have thrived at work and life in 
<br>
general. I didnt really put the connection to the flax seed oil and 
<br>
depression together until a month or so ago when I ran out and didn't bother 
<br>
to buy any more. Yet again after a week without it i started to get a bit 
<br>
depressed. Not much as the days were much brighter by then and the weather 
<br>
had picked up. I looked back and noticed the pattern and in order to check I 
<br>
bought some more and took them.Guess what ?. Yup feeling better again.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im sure that taking them now is also having a placebo effect due to my 
<br>
expectation but there is a very strong physialogical effect without doubt, 
<br>
from taking the capsules. I have never felt better and have not made any 
<br>
other change to my lifestyle other than the flax seed oil.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well there you go, thats my story. I have been depression free for over 7 
<br>
months now and honestly feel it will never be a problem again. I hope that If 
<br>
you suffer as well, that flax seed oil will help you as dramatically as it 
<br>
has helped me. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave the scientific discussion for the chemists and pyscologists 
<br>
among you, hopefully this will be food for thought. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regards,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex
<br>
p.s has anyone got any tips about curing neck ache ??? flax seed oil doesn't 
<br>
work !
