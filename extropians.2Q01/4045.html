<em>&gt; This strikes me as a rather absurd statement.  I grew up around academics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained in the social sciences and I can assure you that they hold a very
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Isn't that a bad thing?  I mean, doesn't holding a &quot;wide variety of views&quot;
<br>
mean that at most one of them is right, all the others are wrong, and that
<br>
they don't have enough evidence to constrain the space of their theories? 
<br>
This isn't actually my argument in this instance, but it deserves pointing
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I have no way of contradicting the assertion that &quot;many social
<br>
scientists are in tune with modern cognitive science, modular neurology,
<br>
and evolutionary psychology&quot;, or that &quot;academic freedom in the social
<br>
sciences is such that most of the smart ones have already abandoned the
<br>
Standard Social Sciences Model in favor of the Integrated Causal Model
<br>
proposed by Tooby and Cosmides in _The Adapted Mind_.&quot;  I simply state
<br>
that I have yet to see such a tendency show up in either the popular press
<br>
or Eurekalert press releases, which I realize could both be dissociated
<br>
from the mainstream academia.
<br>
<p>In any case, my statement holds true, not because of conformity among
<br>
academics in the soft sciences, but because the central,
<br>
taught-in-textbooks dogma of those academic fields is flagrantly wrong. 
<br>
Whether academics are tightly or loosely distributed around this prototype
<br>
- whether they are all wrong in the same way, or whether only 90% of them
<br>
are wrong (in different ways) and the remaining 10% have converged to
<br>
normal science - the average amateur reader of the *correct* formulation
<br>
found in mid-level evolutionary psychology will still be more reliable
<br>
than a randomly chosen academic in a soft science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact this statement of your strikes me as a flagrantly wrong attitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is directly attributable to corruption by political influences ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  I'm not sure you're entirely free from SSSM contamination
<br>
yourself, which may account for some of it.
