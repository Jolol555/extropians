<p>Unfortunately, I've ceased to expect innovation from Comp. Sci. types.

That field stagnates across the border, a real pity.

<p>I agree very much. However, you'll observe that most of your peers don't

(yet). So it will take a while still, unless some unknown hotshot whips up

a killer demo, galvanizing the rest of them into frantic action.

Meanwhile, I'm not holding my breath.
