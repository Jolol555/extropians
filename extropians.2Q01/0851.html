<p>yes.  quicker and better help would be to make nanotech happen from abroad, and
<br>
see what effect that has on third world poverty (big, i expect, at least on
<br>
absolute, if not relative, terms).
<br>
<p>(on your assessment of argentina of your last couple of posts, i agree on lots of
<br>
points and disagree on a few (mainly, i don't think the economic conditions are
<br>
worse now than in 1990. i think they are quite a chunk better. also, freedom of
<br>
speech is at its peak (i wish australia would be at that level), conscription
<br>
exists no more, and there are indications that people (or young people in any
<br>
case) are starting to be politically apathetic, something i find encouraging).  i
<br>
still don't expect any internal reform or financial revolution to change things a
<br>
lot in the next 10-20 years so developing nanotech or AI someplace where money is
<br>
not an issue seems to be the most effective way of helping)
