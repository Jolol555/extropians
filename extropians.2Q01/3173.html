<p>
I want to go back to this very old thread, which I have continued to
<br>
think about, and add a couple of points.
<br>
<p>Earlier I wrote a response to Lee's puzzle about whether it makes sense
<br>
to say that Goldbach's conjecture is unprovable:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Goldbach's Conjecture is that every even number is the sum of two primes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it is false, there must be an even number which is not the sum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two primes.  If such a number exists, then by showing it we could show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that GC is false and GC would not be unprovable (that is, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provably false).  For GC to be unprovable, therefore, would mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no such number exists.  But this is simply the statement of GC itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so to show it to be unprovable (undecidable) is to show it to be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hence you can't show GC to be unprovable.
</em><br>
<p>Other people gave a similar response.
<br>
<p>I wrote earlier about Euclidean geometry minus the parallel postulate
<br>
as a specific historical example of an issue where provability was very
<br>
much in question.  Most of Euclid's axioms seemed completely self-evident:
<br>
two points determine a line, and so on.  But the parallel postulate, that
<br>
through every point not on a line there is exactly one line parallel to
<br>
the given line, never seemed as obvious.  (This is especially true because
<br>
Euclid's actual parallel postulate was worded in a more complicated way
<br>
[1], although it was mathematically equivalent.)  It didn't fit well
<br>
with the other postulates.
<br>
<p>So there were a number of attempts over the years to eliminate the PP by
<br>
showing that it could be derived from the other axioms, but none of them
<br>
succeeded.  In the end it was shown that the PP was independent of the
<br>
other axioms, and in fact you can get non-contradictory and interesting
<br>
versions of geometry by assuming either that there are multiple parallel
<br>
lines through a point or no parallel lines.
<br>
<p>Now, here is how the PP is like GC.  Consider a line and a point above
<br>
the line.  Let there be a 2nd line through the point, not parallel but
<br>
almost.  Say it makes a 5 degree angle with the base line.  Then the
<br>
intersection point is well off to the side.
<br>
<p>Rotate the top line so that it moves through the parallel angle.
<br>
The intersection point moves off, faster and faster.  As we pass through
<br>
the angle of parallelism, the intersection point zooms off to infinity.
<br>
At the same instant, a new intersection point appears at infinity on
<br>
the opposite side, and zooms towards us, slowing down progressively.
<br>
<p>Let's suppose we want to ask whether a weaker version of the PP is true,
<br>
which is whether or not there is at least one parallel line, versus
<br>
whether there are no parallel lines.  We know in fact that this question
<br>
is unprovable.  But here is an argument for why it &quot;can't&quot; be unprovable:
<br>
<p>The PP states that there is an angle at which there are no points of
<br>
intersection as we do the rotation above.  If it is false, as we rotate,
<br>
the 2nd intersection point exists before the first one disappears.
<br>
Therefore there must be some maximum distance away that an intersection
<br>
point can reach; beyond that distance the 2nd intersection point will be
<br>
closer.  The PP is therefore a question of whether such a point of maximum
<br>
distance exists, or whether that point is in effect infinitely far away.
<br>
<p>This point is like the number which is the counter-example to the GC
<br>
in the argument above.  Now I am going to follow sentence-by-sentence
<br>
paralleling the GC argument above.
<br>
<p>&quot;If such a point exists, then by showing it we could show that the PP is
<br>
false, so the PP would not be unprovable.  For the PP to be unprovable,
<br>
therefore, would mean that no such point exists.  But this is simply
<br>
the statement of the (weak) PP itself, so to show it to be unproveable
<br>
(undecideable) is to show it to be true.  Hence you can't show the PP
<br>
to be unprovable.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, just as the falsity of the GC would seem to imply that
<br>
there must be a specific number which ISN'T the sum of two primes, so
<br>
the falsity of the PP would seem to imply that there must be a specific
<br>
distance to a point which is the farthest possible point of intersection.
<br>
For either proposition to be unprovable would seem to imply that there
<br>
is no such number or point, which would mean that they are true.
<br>
<p>In the case of the PP, we can measure the distance to the intersection
<br>
point as the lines approach parallelism.  We can see it getting farther
<br>
and farther away, while confirming that no intersection appears within
<br>
the same distance in the other direction.  This is like experimentally
<br>
verifying the GC by testing it with larger and larger numbers.
<br>
The question is, will the point get to infinity?  And can we keep
<br>
finding even numbers that don't violate the GC, all the way to infinity?
<br>
It's really the same kind of question.
<br>
<p>We know that the reasoning is false in the case of the PP; there exist
<br>
consistent geometries where there are no parallel lines.  We might
<br>
even live in a universe where that is the case; it's possible that if
<br>
we actually tried the rotating line experiment, we would find that the
<br>
intersection point never gets farther than X billion light years away.
<br>
<p>Given that this seemingly valid reasoning is actually mistaken with
<br>
regard to the parallel postulate, I think we need to be very cautious
<br>
about accepting it with regard to Goldbach's Conjecture.  The two cases
<br>
are more alike than might seem at first.

<br>
<p>[1] Euclid's actual Parallel Postulate: If A and D are points on the same
<br>
side of segment(BC) such that measure(angle(ABC)) + measure(angle(BCD)) &lt;
<br>
pi, then ray(BA) intersects ray(CD).
