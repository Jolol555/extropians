<p>&quot;Bullshit,&quot; said Pooh, in a more forthright manner than was

<br>
<p>Not you, Ian.  Im a big fan of your artwork.  The honey-guzzling
<br>
bear is referring only to the anti-amalgam websites.  I am not
<br>
a dentist, dont play one on TV, I have no stock in... Amalgam
<br>
Amalgamated.  {8^D  But do allow me to present a ROM
<br>
explaining why I have not had my fillings removed.
<br>
<p>First, 300 mcg Hg/m3 is not equal to 0.3 mg/m3, but let
<br>
us ignore that, since I didn't use it in my calcs.
<br>
<p>A typical SCUBA tanks is about... what, 20 liters?  And they
<br>
fill those to about 200 atmospheres, so thats 4000 liters or
<br>
4 cubic meters of air, and a tank lasts about an hour or so,
<br>
and if one is at an average depth of 10 meters thats
<br>
2 atmospheres so on the surface a tank should last about 2
<br>
hours, eh?  So we breathe about 2 cubic meters of air per
<br>
hour?  A refrigerator is about 2 cubic meters and I can easily
<br>
imagine a prole trapped in one to last about an hour, so we
<br>
are likely in the right order of magnitude.
<br>
<p>If the OSHA limit is 0.1 mg per m^3 and our fillings
<br>
contributed even half of that, or .05 mg/m^3, then they
<br>
would be evaporating at 0.1 mg per hour.  Even if we
<br>
ignore the fact that amalgam is a mixture of metals {thus
<br>
the name} and assume them pure mercury,  0.1 milligrams
<br>
per hour is about 2.4 milligram per day is about 900
<br>
milligrams per year.
<br>
<p>So how big is a filling?  A cavity is (conservative estimate?)
<br>
20 cubic millimeters?  Assume 50.  Mercury is about 13
<br>
gram/cm^3 so a big filling is 800 milligrams?  I have about
<br>
a dozen fillings and so thats about 10 grams of amalgam.
<br>
So if they dissolved fast enough to provide half the OSHA
<br>
safe limit, a typical head of fillings would be gone in about
<br>
11 years.  Some of my fillings are over 20 years old and
<br>
I cant tell they are any smaller than they have ever been.
<br>
They must be smaller, since they do wear, but the delta is
<br>
not apparent.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, Bobby Fischer had his fillings removed, and he
<br>
is the greatest chess player of all time, however I am not
<br>
convinced of the danger.  {8-]  spike
