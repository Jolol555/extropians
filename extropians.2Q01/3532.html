<p>With better testing and more discussion, farmers will be able to decide for
<br>
themselves if they want to farm with genetically modified crops.
<br>
<p>In another article I read today, &quot;Genetically Altered Foods are the Key to
<br>
Feeding Increasingly Hungry World&quot; (August 27, 2000, Op-ed By Richard
<br>
Berman) --  a couple of quotes of rational.  I especially liked the
<br>
statement about &quot;The organic crusade finds an audience in a movement that
<br>
sees natural farming as one step on the road back to Eden.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The plain truth, quoting FDA Commissioner Jane Henney, is that 'biotech
<br>
products have produced no evidence of food safety risks: not one rash, not
<br>
one sore throat, not one headache.' That is not a claim that organic foods,
<br>
which often eschew such fundamental safety steps as pasteurization, can
<br>
match. &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;How then is the organic-foods industry able to put this new exciting
<br>
agricultural technology under a cloud? Part of the answer is the tendency
<br>
of many Americans to cling to romantic ideals. The organic crusade finds an
<br>
audience in a movement that sees natural farming as one step on the road
<br>
back to Eden. Chefs Collaborative’s founding organization, Oldways, for
<br>
instance, speaks of looking back for dietary lessons that would help
<br>
humanity weave a seamless web of agriculture, behavior, history, tradition,
<br>
culture, health, finance, politics . . . '  Or as Chefs Collaborative board
<br>
member Judy Wicks puts it, 'We like to say we use good food to lure
<br>
innocent customers into social activism.'&quot;
