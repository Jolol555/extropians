Subject: Computer biz singularity
<br>
<p>Might we be witnessing the collapse of all computer related mega-profitable
<br>
business?
<br>
<p>For instance, grocery stores, generic restaraunts, mom &amp; pop gas stations,
<br>
farmers in non-drought years, all run about a 3% profit. That seems to be
<br>
the level you get when anyone can do it and you have a commodity. But it's
<br>
still enough to keep people doing it and feeding their families. Barring
<br>
monopoly and collusion of course, which can get you higher profits for
<br>
oil, electricity, windows, or diamonds.
<br>
<p>My theory - within 2 years software/hardware will reach this state. If
<br>
you're making more then 3% someone small can come along and kick your ass
<br>
quite adeptly by doing it better or for free, and you'll have to cut prices.
<br>
Intel, Cisco, Sun, and EMC would know about this one all too well.
<br>
<p>The evidence for this abounds, everywhere you look, companies are getting
<br>
eatten by the little guys with the weapons of open source, open hardware,
<br>
and moores law. Hardware has vastly outrun real peoples ability to use it,
<br>
and a beastly computer is $700 if you really go nuts (my roomie just built a
<br>
box for his mom better then anything I use for 700). Charging for software
<br>
is getting harder and harder, since I can put together most everything I
<br>
need from free($) software, and we all know where charging for web services
<br>
is going - only the ISP can even hope to run that way by burrying the cost.
<br>
And I think the latest innovation in computing was multi-threading and that
<br>
was 20+ years ago, so patents without prior art are not gonna happen.
<br>
<p>This stuff isn't hard anymore.
<br>
<p>So in 2 years, we'll all be working at biotech companies becasue patents ==
<br>
monopoly == profits. The computer hardware that isn't already made in asia
<br>
will be (by children of course), the software will be free($) or written in
<br>
India. Linux (and windows) now has OS X to copy and will get its GUI
<br>
together. And yet AOL and Disney will still own you.
<br>
<p>This was all covered in my macro and micro econ classes at the U of MN
<br>
during high school... ah the good old days.
<br>
<p>But hey, _THIS_ time the rules could be different... we could make 4%.com
