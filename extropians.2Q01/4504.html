<p><em>&gt; &gt; New Light-Based Computer Runs At Quantum Speeds:

<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/05/010515075526.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/05/010515075526.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anyone know if this is any different from the work of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bucksbaum?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, because they wrote:
<br>
&quot; The caveat is that one should be careful of comparing 
<br>
an inefficient classical algorithm with an efficient quantum one. 
<br>
The experimental implementations of the Grover search to date 
<br>
have not in fact implemented a search of an unsorted database, 
<br>
but rather a database with one single marked item. 
<br>
Therefore experimental evidence for the claimed speedup has 
<br>
yet not been achieved, since a sorted database can be 
<br>
searched classically in log 2 N steps, which is
<br>
identical to the readout limit for a quantum computer.
<br>
The superiority of the quantum search algorithm becomes
<br>
apparent only when one examines carefully the notion of a
<br>
query. It is evident that there is no information gain in the sort
<br>
of oracle query described above, which involves only unitary
<br>
transformations. It is in the encoding of such oracles, which
<br>
must be done by a quantum computer, that the real speedup
<br>
occurs. Once a properly encoded oracle is available, the number
<br>
of steps required to perform the information processing is
<br>
then limited by the final register readout to O(log 2 N).This
<br>
is exactly the same as for a classical information processor,
<br>
which shows that it is the realization of actual information
<br>
by the readout, as opposed to predictive information that is
<br>
contained in the quantum state, that is the ultimate limiting
<br>
procedure in quantum information processing.
<br>
We have shown here that if the readout of the register is
<br>
performed by particle counting then there exists a one-to-one
<br>
correspondence of single-particle quantum interference and 
<br>
classical interference. Therefore we conclude that any enhancements
<br>
in processing power that can be ascribed to quantum
<br>
interference can also be found in classical wave processors,
<br>
and this includes systems based on modal entanglement.
<br>
Multi-particle entanglement, on the other hand, may provide
<br>
enhancements that cannot be efficiently transcribed to classical
<br>
interferometers, even when particle counting is used to
<br>
realize the output information. &quot;
<br>
<p>And then: &quot;. As a consequence, computers
<br>
based on classical waves are as efficient as those
<br>
based on single quantum particles.&quot;

<br>
<p>&quot;How big is a quantum computer?&quot;
<br>
<p>Accounting for resources is the central issue in computational 
<br>
efficiency. We point out physical constraints implicit in
<br>
information readout that have been overlooked in classical 
<br>
computing. The basic particle-counting mode of read-out sets a
<br>
lower bound on the resources needed to implement a quantum 
<br>
computer. As a consequence, computers based on classical waves
<br>
are as efficient as those based on single quantum particles

<p>&quot;Generation of correlated photons in controlled spatial modes 
<br>
by down-conversion in nonlinear waveguides&quot;
<br>
<p>We report the observation of correlated photon pairs generated 
<br>
by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a quasi-phase
<br>
matched KTiOPO4 nonlinear waveguide. The highest ratio of 
<br>
coincidence to single photon count rates observed in the 830 nm
<br>
wavelength region exceeds 18%. This makes nonlinear waveguides 
<br>
a promising source of correlated photons for metrology and
<br>
quantum information processing applications. We also discuss 
<br>
possibilities of controlling the spatial characteristics of the
<br>
down-converted photons produced in multimode waveguide structures.
