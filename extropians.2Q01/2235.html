<p>Well, as late as 1979, the intro to programming course
<br>
at NYU still required you to punch cards.  It was PL/I, though,
<br>
and not Cobol (or even Fortran).  After you punched the
<br>
cards, you had to wait in a queue, at the head of which an operator
<br>
would load your cards into the reader of an RJE (Remote Job Entry)
<br>
terminal connected to an IBM mainframe uptown somewhere.
<br>
If your deck didn't red-light the reader then and there, you'd
<br>
go and wait for the printout to appear (it did come out on
<br>
a local lineprinter, at least), which could be in 15 minutes
<br>
if things weren't too busy, hours otherwise.
<br>
<p>I loved it, though, punched cards and all.  I was working
<br>
at the time in the computer room of a Manhattan bank.
<br>
I was only a tape librarian and gatherer of printouts,
<br>
but I got up close and personal with the IBM 370/158 mainframes
<br>
there, and sometimes the real operators would even let me
<br>
issue the Hasp commands on the console terminals to load
<br>
and release jobs.
<br>
<p>The next-level assembly-language course was hands-on with
<br>
an 8080-based microcomputer, though, with a floppy disk drive,
<br>
a CRT text editor, and everything (operating system must've
<br>
been CP/M, I guess, but I can't remember for sure).
<br>
<p>In the course of researching that Blinkenlights article I
<br>
posted here a while back, reading about the IBM 1620 restoration
<br>
and Java emulator work those folks connected with the west-coast
<br>
computer history museum have done, I came across the story
<br>
of a professor (at Purdue, I think) who had an enormous
<br>
collection of IBM 1620 software on punched cards which he was
<br>
on the point of finally throwing away (it had been declared a
<br>
fire hazard).  The 1620 buffs managed to rescue this irreplaceable
<br>
collection in the nick of time, after which they had to set
<br>
up facilities for reading the cards and embedding card
<br>
images within a more modern file format.  They ended up
<br>
burning the whole kit and caboodle onto a single CD-R.  Of
<br>
course, they also had to interface a PC programmed as a
<br>
virtual card reader to their antique 1620 in order to make
<br>
use of this CD-R.  I got a letter about that article, which
<br>
contained the comment:
<br>
<p>&quot;I will never again consider MY hobbies foolish, no matter how foolish
<br>
they really are.  I can hardly imagine the agony it must take to make
<br>
one of those old machines actually run again.  Making a software
<br>
simulator is child's play compared to that.&quot;
