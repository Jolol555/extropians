<em>&gt; When we think of progress, we remember the Enlightenment.  When we look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back at  Transhumanity, we will think of the progress of progress.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does this mean to you?
</em><br>
<p>To me, the progress of progess means the adaptation of nonlinear models of
<br>
development.  The Englightenment, and mostly the Industrial Revolution,
<br>
pursued the quest of &quot;faster, stronger, cheaper, more&quot; for its processes.
<br>
This was the result of a Newtonian-Cartesian perspective of the world based
<br>
on mechanistic reductionism.  With the advent of complex systems theory, a
<br>
new perspective sprung from concepts like integration, interactions,
<br>
networks, and chaos.  Progress then embodies not a linear path, but an
<br>
expansive exploration of interrelated systems.
<br>
<p>It seems there is much progress of both types underway.  Linear progress of
<br>
engineering methods lends itself to immediate applicability.  Non-linear
<br>
progress at the basic science level, however, opens the way to a paradigm
<br>
shift with more far-reaching consequences.
<br>
<p>One obvious area for non-linear progress to be made in cognitive
<br>
neuroscience.  This is not about making something smaller, faster, or
<br>
better.  It's about understanding the complex networks of structure and
<br>
function underlying our conscious experience.
<br>
<p>Another exciting area for paradigmatic progress is the understanding of the
<br>
fundamental nature of the Universe.  I believe Superstring/Hyperstring (can
<br>
anyone tell me if these are the same, or how they differ?) theory, is an
<br>
example of a current paradigm shift in this realm.  Recent evidence showed
<br>
us to be lacking a complete understanding of the mechanics of gravity (let
<br>
alone its nature).
