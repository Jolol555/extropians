<em>&gt; If you &quot;go back in time&quot; you are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a different branch of the multiverse.
</em><br>
<p>Hawking said: &quot;...if somebody try to move on journey in past effects of
<br>
indefinites will be evoke phenomenon of large amount of irradiation.
<br>
This irradiation will be or disort space-time and not to be possible back
<br>
in time, or will be evoke end of space-time in singularity like Big Bang
<br>
or Big Crush. Fact how is tourist from future not yet visit us is best proof
<br>
how time-travel is not possible and never will be.&quot;
<br>
<p>Since the original works by Goedel there has been a long debate over the
<br>
issue whether the laws of physics might allow for the existence of closed
<br>
time-like curves (CTCs) inside our universe. Macroscopic CTCs might be
<br>
realized as a consequence of the &quot;quantum foam&quot; structure of spacetime, at
<br>
Planck scales. For spacetimes with CTCs, past and future are no longer
<br>
&quot;globally&quot; distinct. Writes I.D. Novikov that events on CTCs should
<br>
causally influence each other along the &quot;loops in time&quot; in a self-adjusted,
<br>
consistent way. This requirement has been explicitly formulated as the
<br>
&quot;principle of self-consistency&quot; according to which the only solutions to the
<br>
laws of physics that can occur - locally - in the real universe are those
<br>
which are - globally - self-consistent. Novikov showed that the &quot;principle
<br>
of self-consistency&quot; actually needs not to be imposed as an independent
<br>
assumption which is necessary in order to make sense of spacetimes with
<br>
CTCs, but instead can be seen as a direct consequence of the more
<br>
fundamental &quot;principle of minimal action&quot;. (Does MWI, in the strongest
<br>
version, violate the principle of minimal action, or Occam's razor?).
<br>
<p>Sean M. Carroll wrote interesting things (below) about J. Richard Gott
<br>
proposal (Phys. Rev. Lett., 4 March 1991) for a time machine.
<br>
<p>------------  
<br>
<p>Gott showed that if you had two infinitely long, perfectly straight,
<br>
parallel cosmic strings moving at a sufficiently high relative velocity,
<br>
then you could in principle travel around the pair of strings and come back
<br>
before you left.  Of course this is a very special (and unlikely) situation,
<br>
but it has the benefit of not requiring negative energy densities (as do
<br>
time machines based on wormholes and so forth).  Even better, it is a very
<br>
simple situation to analyze, since there is a dramatic  simplification -
<br>
since the strings are infinitely long and perfectly straight, you can
<br>
basically ignore the direction along the strings, and imagine you are
<br>
dealing with point particles in a three-dimensional spacetime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this point of view, the Gott time machine was analyzed by Deser,
</em><br>
Jackiw and 't Hooft (1992, Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, p. 267). They considered
<br>
the &quot;momentum&quot; of the two-string system comprising the Gott time machine,
<br>
which (due to the gravitational interaction of the strings) is not simply
<br>
the sum of the individual momenta of the two strings. In fact, the result
<br>
is not equal to the momentum of any conceivable single string, in some ways
<br>
it resembles a tachyon (a particle moving faster than light), although
<br>
there are differences as well.
<br>
<p>Farhi and Guth and Sean M. Carroll used that piece of information to place
<br>
limits on the ability to construct a time machine in an open universe (1992,
<br>
Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, p. 263, p. 3368). They basically showed that, in an
<br>
*open* 3-d universe, if you started with a pair of strings that were moving
<br>
too slowly to be a Gott time machine, you could never accelerate them fast
<br>
enough to make them into a time machine.  (Essentially you could never fit
<br>
enough energy into the universe to have enough rocket fuel). But there is an
<br>
important difference between 3-d and 4-d, in 3-d there's an upper limit on
<br>
the mass of the universe. See also S.M. Carroll, E. Farhi, A.H. Guth and
<br>
K.D. Olum (1994),  Phys. Rev. D 50, p. 6190, or at
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9404065">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9404065</a>
<br>
<p>In *closed* universes (in 3-d) you can fit more mass than in open universes,
<br>
and indeed you have enough energy to make particles/strings go fast enough
<br>
to be a Gott time machine. Surprisingly, though, if you try to actually loop
<br>
around the strings to meet yourself in the past, the universe collapses to a
<br>
singularity (a big crunch) before you can ever get there. This was shown by
<br>
Gerard 't Hooft (1992, Class. Quant. Grav. 9, p. 1335).
<br>
<p>So general relativity - says Sean M. Carroll - is quite successful at
<br>
preventing you from making a time machine from scratch, at least in
<br>
3-dimensions. It would be nicer to know the situation in the real
<br>
4-dimensional world, but it's trickier there.  There are some theorems that
<br>
imply you need either singularities or negative energy densities to do it,
<br>
but the situation is still murky. See for example Hawking's paper: (1992),
<br>
Phys. Rev. D 46, p. 603.
<br>
<p>-----------
<br>
<p>As far as I remember there's a theorem saying that if you have a closed
<br>
null geodesic, then the energy density of a region near some point
<br>
on it, gets magnified when it takes a trip along this geodesic.
<br>
If we find infinite energy densities unreal, we can say that there are
<br>
no closed null geodesics (and no time machines). The argument then becomes
<br>
whether quantum &quot;violations&quot; get you out of it.
