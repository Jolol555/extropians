</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's always been a strain of this in _Trek_, 
</em><br>
<p>They've always touted an anti-capitalism, anti-western, anti-tech
<br>
theology:
<br>
<p>Ferengi - derived from an arabic word synonymous with 'disgusting
<br>
infidel moneychanger'.
<br>
<p>Q - Poster child for leftist distrust of unrestrained individual liberty
<br>
and technological development.
<br>
<p>Borg - are depicted to look like undead ghouls, although the Voyager
<br>
positive depiction of Seven of Nine, who has retained many borg
<br>
technologies does offset this a bit, but only because she does emphasize
<br>
the individual as superior to the collective, which does show that all
<br>
hope is not lost on ST.
<br>
<p>While the idea of collective minds through the forced assimilation of
<br>
individuals is abhorrent to me, it seems that the Borg concept was
<br>
created specifically to demonize implantation, nanotech, and other
<br>
bootstrapping technologies as evil.
<br>
<p>Also on Voyager, the race that was giving the Borg a run for its money,
<br>
which held the ethic of 'evolve or perish' were also depicted as a
<br>
seriously malignant species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And wasn't there an episode of _Star Trek: Deep Space Nine_ that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revealed that Dr. Julian Bashear owed his obnoxiously high IQ to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illegal (in the Federation) genetic manipulation, and that he lied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it to get into Star Fleet?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, we've also had _Star Trek: The Next Generation_'s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lt. Commander Data, friendly AI and Pinocchio wannabe, whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom as a sentient being was defended in Star Fleet court by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Captain Picard when a representative of the Daystrom Institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to claim him as government property.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, he was a good AI because he believed in his own inferiority
<br>
compared to natural humans, just as capitalists like Ben &amp; Jerry, etc
<br>
are 'good' capitalists because they buy into propaganda that demonizes
<br>
capitalism.
