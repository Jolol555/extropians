<em>&gt; For a bandwidth-slow system, you split off a lot of independent packages

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increase the size of your largest high-speed thought, but you can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large but very slow thoughts, or a huge number of small and fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts.  Distributing a human brain over the Internet would slow it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down.  A seed AI distributing verself over the Internet would need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change the character of vis cognition, but after that could take full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of computing power.
</em><br>
<p><p>For many types of codes and algorithms, there is no transformation that will
<br>
allow it to be usable on a true loosely distributed system like the
<br>
Internet.  For &quot;usable&quot; I refer you to &quot;scalability, integrity, stability --
<br>
pick any two&quot;.  (There actually are relevant theorems and proofs for this,
<br>
but this version makes for much shorter reading.)  Notice that there are
<br>
some types of applications and algorithms that are conspicuously absent on
<br>
distributed systems that could certainly use more performance and for which
<br>
a huge market already exists.  This is not an accident; for some
<br>
applications, integrity and stability are not disposable.
<br>
<p>Assuming that integrity and stability are essential for building an AI, we
<br>
are essentially painted into a corner with respect to how well an AI will
<br>
scale on a piece of hardware such as the Internet.  The fact that the
<br>
Internet is composed of slow high-latency links just aggravates this
<br>
situation by effectively consuming the relatively small bit of scalability
<br>
allowed with almost no payoff to the AI.
<br>
<p>But yes, in theory you could have a slowly -- *VERY* slowly -- growing AI
<br>
that operated over the Internet.  However, I would expect it to be
<br>
surpassed, probably unnoticed, by an AI running on systems that have been
<br>
better engineered for the task.  Note that the differences in scalability
<br>
for these different types of implementations is in terms of orders of
<br>
magnitude.  A task that might take a basement cluster AI a day to do on
<br>
modern hardware may take years for one distributed over the Internet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, you can say nothing at all about how much of an inefficiency this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represents at the *cognitive* level.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not sure what this means.  The inefficiency of using the Internet as a
<br>
distributed system could very well mean that a seed AI never reaches
<br>
critical mass intelligence-wise.  This represents a real hard limit, for now
<br>
at least.  Basically, you have to look at the problem as determining the
<br>
maximum throughput of a given algorithm (AI in this case) on a given piece
<br>
of hardware (A large, loosely distributed system in this case).  You can
<br>
treat a distributed system exactly like a single piece of hardware because
<br>
mathematically there is no difference.  Plug in the numbers and turn the
<br>
crank.  Everything I've seen appears to suggest that, even if you did send
<br>
an AI out over the Internet, you could figuratively kick its ass with a
<br>
well-designed basement cluster by any useful metric.
<br>
<p>This is a useful discussion in any case.  I don't recall ever seeing it come
<br>
up on the extropians list since I've been on it.
