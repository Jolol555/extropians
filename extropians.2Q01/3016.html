<em>&gt;: Anders Sandberg
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I am fond of the idea of review boards, groups or reviewers placing their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seals of approval (or denial, for that matter) on papers without being tied 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to journals. [...] the review information might also be available 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the net. [...]
</em><br>
<p>One of my projects, THEOLIS, is about building some kind of a meta review
<br>
system, enabling anyone to easily create new private systems, or to
<br>
participate in public review systems. <a href="http://www.theolis.net/">http://www.theolis.net/</a>
<br>
Alongside the review, the possibility to cache, save and annotate articles
<br>
will allow to make access to articles more robust and long-lived, while
<br>
making intellectual property privileges less and less relevant.
<br>
We're currently stalled for lack of funding, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What remains to be figured out is how to make this profitable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the reviewers (so they want to do it) without introducing risks of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biasing them through payment. 
</em><br>
No need to _make_ it profitable for the reviewers.
<br>
Just connect people, and let people organize naturally according
<br>
to their marginal interest.
<br>
<p>* Some people love various topics, and will read articles, anyway.
<br>
&nbsp;They will provide reviews, anyway. They will need these reviews for
<br>
&nbsp;themselves, when they use the material in their own further works, anyway.
<br>
&nbsp;Let's just take advantage of it, by making it easier for them to share
<br>
&nbsp;information than not to share it.
<br>
<p>* Other people want to organize into consistent committees.
<br>
&nbsp;More power to them. Allow them to express their collective opinions
<br>
&nbsp;without encurring the hassle of real paper print, and/or providing
<br>
&nbsp;them with the tools to handle on-demand printing.

The meta-Turing test counts a thing as intelligent if it seeks to apply

Turing tests to objects of its own creation.
