I only just joined this list so my apologies for butting in so soon, but I
<br>
can't let an argument like this pass. I think both sides are missing
<br>
something. For those like Manny you must ask &quot;What is the alternative for
<br>
sweatshop workers?&quot; Not to do so is irresponsible, because one thing is
<br>
sure, the alternative isn't American or European style working conditions.
<br>
It most probably is something even worse such as starvation or sex work. On
<br>
the other hand you can't stop there. Having to chose between starvation and
<br>
near slavery is technically a choice but !! Moreover why is that the
<br>
&quot;choice&quot; on offer? This is where historical perspective (economic history)
<br>
come in useful. The fact that there is no shortage of replacement workers
<br>
tells us at once that there is a highly elastic supply of labour which has
<br>
driven the price of labour down to near subsistence levels. This in turn is
<br>
caused by mass displacement of labour out of agrculture by increased labour
<br>
productivity. Knowing this tells us in turn what is the best course of
<br>
policy, public and personal. It certainly isn't to boycott the products
<br>
these unfortunate people are making. It makes more sense to allow freer
<br>
movement of peoples, to encourage education of women, to scrap agricultural
<br>
protectionism by the US and EU, to encourage foreign investment into China
<br>
etc and, above all, to work at making the labour of such people more
<br>
productive so they are in a position to charge a higher price for their
<br>
labour. I'm not saying this is easy - the Kuznets curve is one of the most
<br>
difficult problems to handle historically. The record however is that such
<br>
problems last no more than 20 years IF you have uninterrupted development.

<p><p>You know, I sincerely hope that this compassionless guy who sees nothing
<br>
wrong with foriegn sweatshops doesn't in any way represent what most
<br>
extropians think.  Talk about reason without emotion, geez.  Some of us
<br>
think that human beings have these things called rights, not just the ones
<br>
in the first amendment, but also ones like liberty, the pursuit of
<br>
happiness, etc.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure you think that's very backward and overly-romanticized of me to
<br>
say that.  But I think people deserve to have a chance to do more than the
<br>
same tedium over and over all thier lives, always at the mercy of thier
<br>
employers if they say anything or disobey.  I mean, isn't that why the west
<br>
abandoned serfdom and industrialized agriculture, so we *wouldn't* have to
<br>
work our asses off all the time just to survive?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow a heart, for pete's sake.
