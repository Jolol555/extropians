<p>IT is hard, it requires both skills which can only be acquired in a long
<br>
training process, culmitating in a few years of professional experience, 
<br>
plus (effectively) innate mental capabilities (which I unfortunately don't
<br>
quite have), the demand is going up monotonously whereas the demographics 
<br>
in core demand areas are worsening continously as does the attitude and 
<br>
initial state of knowledge of young people, as the education structure
<br>
is largely in shambles (all this relates to postindustrial cultures,
<br>
the post-threshold developing countries are of course exempt from that trend).
<br>
<p>So, I think *good* IT people will always have good market value, associated
<br>
with according salary (and ridiculously long hours, another major off-putter). 
<br>
It's sad, because science really suffers from the brain drain, but you can 
<br>
hardly blame young researchers facing an outlook of a ratty pay, and 
<br>
contracts which are renewed (or not renewed) in 2 year increments, while
<br>
even your research is effectively dictated by your PI. I haven't yet seen
<br>
the industrial R&amp;D elite yet, so I don't know how the personal situation
<br>
is up there.
