<em>&gt; &gt; Here's what one reader says about THE SPIKE on amazon.com:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;                 Reviewer: A reader from Berkeley, CA USA
</em><br>
<p>Well, there ya go, thats the problem.
<br>
<p>{8^D
<br>
<p>I cannot let this heap of insult lie unanswered.  If the reviewer
<br>
wishes to compare The Spike with Clarke's Profiles, well,
<br>
I suppose there are worse things than being compared with
<br>
THE Arthur C. Clarke, eh?
<br>
<p>But one thing that really should be pointed out about The Spike
<br>
is that it has a *shape* to it.  The overall work *accelerates*
<br>
and for that reason it is clear that this is a technology story done
<br>
by a *real* literary talent.  Now Clarke was a great technologist,
<br>
scientist, and sci-fi writer, but Profiles doesn't have that *shape*
<br>
to it.
<br>
<p>In my own feeble attempts at fiction, I have tried to shape a
<br>
story, with nice smooth transitions.  I have characters who
<br>
transition from one point of view to the opposite, and I try
<br>
to do it seamlessly, so it is impossible to tell exactly when
<br>
the characters transition.
<br>
<p>The Spike builds and seamlessly approaches a climax.  The
<br>
work itself is shaped like a spike.  spike
