<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; If there were no shortage, your salaries/rates would be lower than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Then, where would the incentive be to get people from overseas? &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, so basically you approve of a pay cap for domestic workers based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global competition, because the domestic workers demand too much. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much the view that I expected of those of a libertarian economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy, and who is to say you are wrong?
</em><br>
<p><p>You have read me wrong (libertarian economic philosophy indeed!). What I
<br>
mean is, that if there were no shortfall, you guys (and us guys) couldn't
<br>
charge what we all do. I think it's pretty clear evidence of a shortfall...
<br>
after all, it's not as if we are unionized or something. Any two programmers
<br>
have difficulty working together; there is no collusion on a grand scale.
<br>
So, the market is paying what it must, despite lack of organisation in geek
<br>
ranks; one can only conclude that it is undersupply.
<br>
<p>So, perhaps the need for H1Bs is completely real?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if there were no supply problem, there'd be no reason to
<br>
go fishing overseas; prices would be lower. But there is, and there is,
<br>
because they're not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But all should be forced to compete in the global market. Why not bring in
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; million medical professionals to take care of us in the USA? What about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sweetheart deals could be set up between health insurance companies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pharmacy chains-halving costs? This could apply to legal services also. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean, why pay lawyers thousands of dollars when foreign attorneys could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more inexpensive? How about foreign  police and fire services? Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should these be exempt? :-)  Eh! Its a notion.
</em><br>
<p>Because... there is no shortfall. Or, if there is, in the areas of medical
<br>
and legal people you can't just ship 'em in, because of regulation of the
<br>
industries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is a link to a law firm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is dedicated to protect and promote foreign IT workers. Its a 'dated'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link but it provides a bit of info.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.visalaw.com/h1bpage.html">http://www.visalaw.com/h1bpage.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are definitely contracting shops around who are trucking in Indian
<br>
coders (damn their skillful hides) and selling their services. I know it's
<br>
happening here (oz), dunno bout the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yah! This has been done by Microsoft, with its India based training
</em><br>
centers
<br>
<em>&gt; already, but there are contracting firms bringing significant numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign workers, anyway (see the law firm link above).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So where does that leave us? If Joe Corp executive has come to feel that
</em><br>
he
<br>
<em>&gt; can get quality work of imported foreign workers, it will delight his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shareholders if such occurs-more money in the short term. Notice how H1-Bs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never applies to managers?
</em><br>
<p>There's no shortage of managers!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Supposedly, 5.6 million new IT workers will be needed in the USA in the
</em><br>
next
<br>
<em>&gt; 5 years. Gates and company may have a point, if true. If not....?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If not, and it shits us, then we retrain into a new industry. Hell knows,
<br>
coders have been involved in making that happen (redundancy) to enough other
<br>
workers out there. No-one will cry for us if it is our turn, mark my words!
