<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ja, but what Im looking for here is to free Kistler et al from

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; reliability.  Let NASA do what NASA does, lift primates
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Two problems- historically, they've killed almost 1% of the humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they've tried to launch.  That ain't &quot;safely&quot; in my book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, crap, Doug. Somewhere around a quarter of all people who trekked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the American west were killed in violent confrontations or plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidity rather quickly, I've heard. A 1% loss is tiddlywinks.
</em><br>
<p>Trekkers, pretty much by definition, are nearly broke emigrants with no
<br>
money to spare.  Tourists, on the other hand, pay handsomely for the
<br>
privilege- but expect near-certainty of survival.  Sure, mountain
<br>
climbers get killed quite often but they are not a multi hundred billion
<br>
dollar a year market.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Second, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; big market, the real enabler for routine cheap access to space, is space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tourism.  Leaving manned space flight in NASA's hands is like building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; luxury island hotel, then using an F-18 to deliver guests via ejection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its worse than that. The outside temps run from 250 above to 250 below
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the hotel air conditioning is likely to go on the fritz at any given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment, and you lose a hunk of your bone mass while up there, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give you a lousy exercise bike for keeping in shape.
</em><br>
<p>Outside temps aren't a big deal with decent insulation and active
<br>
thermal control (valved heat pipes, pretty much), atmosphere reclaim can
<br>
(and should) be modular and redundant, and a tourist won't lose enough
<br>
bone mass in a one week visit to be concerned.  As for exercise bikes,
<br>
consider a large zero gee play volume with an icarus wing harness-
<br>
that'll not only keep the visitors in shape, they'll have more muscle
<br>
when they go home, just cause its so damn fun.
<br>
<p>Lots of problems just go away if you can throw lots of mass at them, and
<br>
keep stay times short thanks to frequent flights.  Only the staff needs
<br>
good low-gee prophylaxic medicine and exercise.
