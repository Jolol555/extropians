<p><em>&gt;The episode is entitled &quot;Superhumanity 2.0 - Cyborgs&quot; (it follows

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Exhibit A, I'd be happy to represent a more rounded view, informed by others

</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;- Killer app 1: Life extension... This application will really pull &quot;cyborg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology&quot; into mainstream culture. 
</em><br>
<p>You might consider using percentages:  For example, 25% of Australian
<br>
population already has had an augmentation to their bodies.  5% now use
<br>
robotic arms or legs; 10% have received pacemakers; %3 percent IUDs.
<br>
(There are arbitrary, but I think you could get some solid facts which
<br>
would be persuasive in your introduction to augmentations.) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who delve into these areas... HRT is a great example. These people will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;label themselves 
</em><br>
<p>HRT is a different augmentation - a chemical augment to monitor female
<br>
hormones to prevent the onslaught of menopause.  You could suggest that
<br>
even the mind is augmented by ingesting certain hormones to regulate the
<br>
chemistry of our bodies for a more healthy and vital life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- Killer app 2: N
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Killer app 3: Eternal youth and the beauty industry..y
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what form it takes... Brad Pitt/Nicole Kidman? 
</em><br>
<p>How about the man who stared in The X Men?  Isn't he Aussi?
<br>
Here you could mention how reversing aging has been on the cover of
<br>
magazines, Time, Newsweek, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Whatever the exact form is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it apparently doesn't have wrinkles, cellulite or body hair. It can, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other hand, have breast implants, a face lift or a nose job.
</em><br>
<p>nose lift = rhinoplasty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There will be a strong overlap between life extension technologies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beauty related technologies. 
</em><br>
<p>You might want to consider mentioning that the concept of beauty has
<br>
changed over the eons, from Cleopatra to a Rubenesque figure to Twiggy to
<br>
the athletic bodies of today.  Beauty today is viewed as not just a symbol
<br>
of a perfect face, but also a healthy physique and attitude.
<br>
<p>In the years to come, we will be able to regulate the body to adjust any
<br>
dryness of skin, wrinkling caused from sun damage (important to mention in
<br>
Australia) and aging.  To reverse the onslaught of aging we will see less
<br>
and less cosmetic surgery and more genetic engineering and biotechnology.
<br>
The genes that cause our minds and bodies to age more rapidly than our
<br>
desire to grow older will be reversed and we will see a more youthful
<br>
young-old generation ahead.  
<br>
<p>The concept of beauty will change over the years and what is considered
<br>
beautiful today may not be beautiful tomorrow.  When we can alter the
<br>
color, tone and texture of our skin, alter our voices to express our
<br>
emotions with a harmonious reverberation, develop our eyes to see great
<br>
distances (etc.), beauty as we see it today might seem flat and unexciting.
<br>
<p>(Consider your audience - you don't want to freak them out too much, but
<br>
you do want to give them some facts about what will occur.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, as our technology for self modification improves, and we can more easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hit the mark, the beauty industry will move the target. There are some great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stats out there (The Beauty Myth contains some decent research) to show that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;ideal woman&quot;, for example, is a physically impossible being already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When we add cyborg technology to the mix, where will the collective ideal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the perfect form move to? Somewhere as odd as it is extreme, and it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivate ever larger uptake of the sillier forms of cyborg technology.
</em><br>
<p>I't too bad they are using the term &quot;cyborg&quot;.  It's so metal sounding and
<br>
makes me think of Warwick.  You want to take this opportunity to be
<br>
welcoming of humanity and compassionate to why people want to look
<br>
beautiful (both men and women).  If _Aristoi_ is a wonderful example of
<br>
beauty in the future for both genders.  I get a little toasted when
<br>
thinking of old world concepts of beauty and tagging this to women as if
<br>
this is what our lives are about.  I have always said, &quot;Beauty is a 12
<br>
letter word - &quot;intelligence.&quot;  The most beautiful people are those who
<br>
aspire to achieve their dreams, are vital and expressive.  Not all are
<br>
pretty faces, but inspire us and allure us.  Even Cleopatra was considered
<br>
an idol, yet she was not so physically beautiful at all.
<br>
<p>So, you could introduce the idea of enhancing &quot;beauty in the eye of the
<br>
beholder&quot; by saying we can tweak our visual recognition patters to
<br>
highlight facial qualities that we like and reduce those that we find
<br>
unappealiang.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;- Physical enhancements... In the cyberpunk literature, people tend to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very silly modifications, so that they can look freaky, or have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enhanced physical trait. Steve Austin, eat your heart out. However, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe that these will be the very last types of enhancements that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made, and the least frequent. In the world of today, and certainly in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of tomorrow, physical enhancements are and become less useful than one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppose. Leap tall buildings in a single bound? Sure... but why not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take the lift? It might not turn out to be very important to a modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;westerner to be able to lift a small truck; it might be far more useful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merely look as though you could.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eventually physical enhancements will become more important, as our biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;begins to really let us down... we may need to change form to cope with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overcrowding of earth, we'll definitely need to change form to explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space. That, however, is some way off.
</em><br>
<p>You could mention Dennis Tito the space tourist and that when we reside in
<br>
space we will have different environment to cope with and we will need to
<br>
consider the consequences of space and how to protect our bodies.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;e. Babbage could see the computer, daVinci
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could see human flight, Jules Verne could see space travel. We can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanity.
</em><br>
<p>But we are transhumanity.   We can see a time when disease is a thing of
<br>
the past, when the pollution is no longer an issue, etc.. (You don't want
<br>
to sound too Pollyannaish for your audience, but you do want to offer them
<br>
a vision of the future.)  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This whole discussion of mine probably looks hopelessly ill-informed to many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of you... so tell me why. What's important that I've missed? Where am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong? Where is my presentation flawed? Don't quietly grumble about it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself... if you can correct my misinformation, then I'm less likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say something problematic on the box.
</em><br>
<p>It's really quite good Emlyn.  Most people want soundbytes on television,
<br>
not lengthy discourse.  You might want to pick a one-liner for each
<br>
category you will be discussing and be as succinct as possible.  Offer your
<br>
audience some facts or percentages and remember this may be new to them.
<br>
<p>(Pssst  ... bio/info for the music Web page ??) :-)
