Hi,
<br>
<p>I enjoy news items, as well as non-news (well-written essays, humor, references
<br>
to good online resources).   It's difficult for any single individual to track
<br>
more than one or two fields at a time, and I enjoy it when someone posts some
<br>
unusual/interesting development in a field that I wasn't even aware existed.
<br>
<p>It would be nice if there were more server-side, web-based filtering options.
<br>
For example, although I think a significant fraction of the list is interested
<br>
in business news, many probably aren't.  It would be nice if there were a way
<br>
that individuals who didn't want business news could set up a server-side
<br>
killfile that prevented titles with TECH or BIZ from being sent to them, or
<br>
posts from particular individuals.  Sometimes I don't have a lot of time, and I
<br>
don't want to read all of the posts, but I also don't want to miss posts by
<br>
people who almost always have something interesting to say (Max, for
<br>
instance).
<br>
<p>Server side filtering might also provide some useful statistics--for exampe,
<br>
would those who post one-liners + lots of quoted text do so if they discovered
<br>
that 90% of the list had put them into their killfile?    Sophisticated
<br>
client-side filtering software exists of course, and for those with inexpensive
<br>
flat-rate connections, these work fine, but I'm sure that those who pay
<br>
per-minute charges would prefer not to have to download the unwanted posts
<br>
before they filter it.
<br>
