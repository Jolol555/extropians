<p>Right, it's Pigs in Space, primate version. It nicely demonstrates

that in the year 2001 A.D. we're thoroughly incapable of an intelligent
<br>
space programme. Uck. Ptui.
<br>
<p>Canned and suited monkeys instead of automation and teleoperation. 
<br>
Low earth orbit instead of Moon surface. Stupid basic research 
<br>
instead of industrial pioneer R&amp;D. But hey, there's no such thing 
<br>
as window of opportunity, and we have all the time of the world, 
<br>
right? Right?

<p><em>&gt; it as an orbiting observatory platform or an &quot;assembly&quot; operation

<em>&gt; Answer this -- why can't one attach a couple of dozen Baby Hubble's

<p>Right, it's microgravity. All the monkeys cavorting about and and the
<br>
din and vibration will probably make instrument stabilization
<br>
nontrivial. Plus, the damn thing will leak, and contaminate your
<br>
optics, and sensors. But it is certainly jolly good entertainment, 
<br>
and looks so serious, and important on cable. So you can forget how
<br>
much money is being blown on entertainment, and self-sustaining
<br>
technological bureaucracy.
