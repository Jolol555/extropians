Fellow non sims,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my theory that you can't have multiple levels of
<br>
phenomenal qualities.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract machines can clearly have many levels of simulations
<br>
running yet more higher level abstract simulations.  But the reality
<br>
of every level is still fundamentally based on the lowest level of
<br>
reality.  Let's assume that the physical reality science has shown us
<br>
is not an abstract simulation for a moment.  In this case a silicon
<br>
flip flop in a certain state can represent a 1.  At the next level up,
<br>
this could represent 700 nm light.  The next level beyond this it
<br>
could abstractly represent red.... and so on.  But all of these levels
<br>
are still based on the physically real bottom or primal silicon flip
<br>
flop.  If you flip the physical state of the flip flop it changes
<br>
everything all the way up.  All of the layers above it are dependent
<br>
on this &quot;real&quot; level.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problem is, all we know of the physical nature of this
<br>
flip flop, is the abstract cause and effect it has on our senses.  Our
<br>
senses only abstractly model the cause and effect this physical flip
<br>
flop has in our world.  Science has not yet advanced beyond abstractly
<br>
looking for just the cause and effect of things.  Hence, we have no
<br>
way of knowing if the cause and affect the flip flop hass on our sense
<br>
is some primal base level object, or some abstract simulation of such
<br>
many layers above reality.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phenomenal qualities of qualia are something more than these
<br>
abstract things that can be represented at any level.  Red is like
<br>
something.  Green is not like red.  The fundamental and phenomenal
<br>
nature of these qualia must be at the base or primal level.  Red can
<br>
represent one and green can represent zero, on top of this you can
<br>
have the same kind of infinite layer of abstract simulations.  Red
<br>
could represent 700 nm light at the next level, which could represent
<br>
something else entirely different at the next level and so on.  But
<br>
once you leave the real level, everything becomes abstracted, and what
<br>
it is fundamentally and phenomenally &quot;like&quot; is no longer relevant.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, it is all red.  Red is simply being interpreted as
<br>
something different at all the other abstract levels.  At the real
<br>
level it is truly red.  But at all the other levels it is just red
<br>
representing something else.  Though we don't really know what the
<br>
flip flop is, other than the abstract data our senses collect about
<br>
it, we do know, first hand, what qualia are and what they are really
<br>
like.  We know more about qualia, than we know about a flip flop.  The
<br>
phenomenal properties of qualia go away at the first abstracted world
<br>
above it.  For all we know, the state of a flip flop could be, at the
<br>
bottom layer, just something that is red or green in the mind of some
<br>
God.  The red and green that we know, could be a subset of this mind
<br>
of God, but it is something more than just an abstract thing that can
<br>
be represented by anything else.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My theory is, science is about to make a large paradigm shift.
<br>
It will start looking for more than the abstract cause and effect
<br>
results on our senses of everything.  It will finally start to look
<br>
for and classify phenomenal qualities, or what things are like;
<br>
something that is more important than it's abstract cause and effect
<br>
on things.  The discovery of qualia and their phenomenal qualities,
<br>
efing, and so on, will force this.  Once we do this, we'll finally
<br>
realize what phenomenal qualities really are, and how mere abstract
<br>
representations, though they can be set up to have the same cause and
<br>
effect, can be nothing really like them.  We'll look back and wonder
<br>
how we could have been so foolish to have had these kinds of
<br>
discussions wondering if we could exist in some abstracted simulated
<br>
world, yet still experience colors like red and green.
<br>
