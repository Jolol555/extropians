<br>
<p><p><p>This is a delightful rant.
<br>
<p>The back-story:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Some version of Microsoft Internet Explorer has a security
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hole that basically permits an email message to run an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitrary bit of code when the message is read.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Having been told of the problem, Microsoft released a patch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fix it.  Six weeks later.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Many, many people have gotten the patch, but it fails to do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anything in a lot of cases.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- In some of those cases, it tells you that everything is now
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunky-dory....

<p><em>&gt; Have not upgraded from what to what?
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's the problem.  It's almost like Microsoft wants its users
<br>
to be vulnerable.  According to Wired, MS took six weeks to release
<br>
the patch after being advised of the security hole. (Six weeks!)
<br>
<p>Instead of releasing a single patch that would work on all versions of
<br>
MSIE, they released two, thus immediately doubling the complexity of
<br>
the upgrade process.
<br>
<p>Not only will the wrong patch not work, but even the right patch will
<br>
fail if you have already upgraded your MSIE _too_far_. Microsoft's
<br>
instructions are essentially to _uninstall_ your copy of MSIE,
<br>
_downgrade_ (but how do you download the older version if you removed
<br>
MSIE? oops), and then apply the proper _upgrade_ patch. Wow.
<br>
<p>The icing on the cake, the just _unbelievable_ thing, is that if you
<br>
try the right patch and your system has been upgraded to the wrong
<br>
thing, you will be told that you're safe when you're not.  Boggle. Of
<br>
all the security things you want never, ever to do.  And this is after
<br>
_six_weeks_ of preparation by the Microsoft team.
<br>
<p>I don't think the importance of this security hole can be overstated.
<br>
This should be front-page news on every newspaper and the lead story
<br>
on your 11 o'clock TV news.  This allows an attacker to take over your
<br>
computer by sending you an email.  No attachments, no double-clicking,
<br>
no visiting websites.  You read the email and suddenly your computer
<br>
does not belong to you any more, it belongs to someone else.  If you're
<br>
lucky it belongs to some shadowy cabal from Turkmenistan or Taiwan.
<br>
If you're unlucky, your IP number has been publicly posted and your
<br>
machine belongs to ANYONE WHO WANTS IT.
<br>
<p>The nightmare, the just utter nightmare, is that some punk kid will
<br>
write the next Melissa or ILOVEYOU worm -- we're overdue now, people
<br>
have already forgotten Anna Kornikova's legacy -- and it spreads
<br>
around the world just as quickly as any of its predecessors.  Except,
<br>
instead of just being annoying and clogging mail servers, this worm
<br>
has a payload:  it opens a telnet backdoor in your system, maybe
<br>
replaces a few binaries with workalike trojans, and then posts your
<br>
IP number to alt.u.r.hacked.
<br>
<p>And then it proceeds to find the last 100 people who have emailed you,
<br>
and it emails them, &quot;Re:&quot; that last mail, with itself as an
<br>
attachment.  Those 100 people will just think you forgot to type in an
<br>
email message, but now they're infected too.  Oh, and it finds 100
<br>
random recent .doc files on your hard drive and uploads their content
<br>
to FreeNet (maybe looking for key words like &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;love&quot;).  But
<br>
you won't even know anything's wrong until you hear it from CNN.
<br>
<p>Suddenly the entire world -- the entire freaking stupid Petri-dish
<br>
Microsoft-suckling silly ignorant world -- belongs to the crackers.
<br>
What will be the internet be like when, say, 30% of the machines on
<br>
the net are 0wned by anyone who wants to telnet into them?
<br>
<p>It will be complete and utter chaos.  It will be unimaginable.
<br>
<p>We are literally standing on the brink of worldwide catastrophe, the
<br>
meltdown of the entire world's computing infrastructure.  We are right
<br>
now in a situation where a 15-year-old with a little free time between
<br>
classes can destroy the machines on which the world's economy depends,
<br>
and destroy it so thoroughly that it will take six months to clean up.
<br>
<p>This is a national crisis.  This should be on the front page of the
<br>
New York Times.  The President of the United States should be urging
<br>
people to upgrade their browsers.  But you cannot even find news about
<br>
this on the homepage of the Microsoft website!
<br>
<p>Let me repeat that:  YOU CANNOT FIND INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO UPGRADE
<br>
YOUR BROWSER ON THE MICROSOFT HOMEPAGE.
<br>
<p>In fact, even if you know to go to microsoft.com/security, you still
<br>
have to go TWO MORE CLICKS before you get to the place where you can
<br>
BEGIN TO DOWNLOAD THE PATCH.
<br>
<p>And the worst part?  If (when!) this 15-year-old kid just takes the
<br>
final logical step and writes the worm that pulverizes the internet,
<br>
the newspapers and TV and radio and magazines will all just quote
<br>
Microsoft about how unfortunate this is, and how Microsoft had a patch
<br>
out in time, and how writing such a worm needs to be punishable by
<br>
serious, serious punishment, the kind of serious, serious punishment
<br>
which will be really serious to 15-year-olds.
<br>
<p>The worst part -- the very thought of blaming Microsoft will never be
<br>
uttered, not breathed nor even considered, by a single pundit or
<br>
talking head or newspaper editor, because -- the underlying thought,
<br>
which everybody accepts without ever consciously considering -- what
<br>
other choice do we have?
