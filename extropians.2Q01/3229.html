<p><em>&gt;How do extropians envision transition from mankind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to whatever posthuman future awaits us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What are the documented scenarios that have been considered?
</em><br>
<p>This is our main subject, and has been discussed numerous times.
<br>
The archives should have these threads, but we're always free to
<br>
bring it up again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I mean, afaik, historically, genetic replacement happens by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;massive extinction of species in very short times
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(geologicallywise, anyway), with the surviving ones filling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;void (that they might or not have caused, to begin with). Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expect some posthuman species to just sit around (maybe in secret)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and takeover the planet after some inevitable catastrophe wipes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mankind? I don't think the humans would let such thing happen --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if they're going to be destroyed, they won't hesitate to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;planet unliveable. Or maybe other planets would be a shelter to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posthumans, where they'd wait for the final demise of mankind?
</em><br>
<p>I would argue that we will see a directed evolution of the human
<br>
species. This is very much in line with theories posted in Linda
<br>
Nagata's &quot;Tech Heaven&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Now we are gaining control of DNA itself, the first implications
<br>
will come about in re-writing the sequence to correct defects, but
<br>
these will be followed almost immediately by genetic replacement of
<br>
certain asthetic (plastic) surgeries. In other words people will
<br>
not go in for surgical treatment for things like breast
<br>
augmentation or baldness treatments, but these will be accomplished
<br>
by direct manipulation of the DNA sequence. And say a treatment for
<br>
removing wrinkles, and we have a fine start. Life extension will
<br>
become a protocol involving a series of many of these individual
<br>
treatments. 
<br>
<p>I guess we could call this the incrementalist approach.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If not, this might mean a completely different way for species to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emerge than have been seen in the past. Do you expect genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enhancement to become so cheap that just about every human will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually have been modified? Would that result into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sustainable species? How long do you expect it for the transition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to take? Won't the biggest brake to such transition be public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opinion and traditional religion? Or would there be such invisible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;riskless individual enhancements that people would first use them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undercover until it becomes so common that prejudices be gone?
</em><br>
<p>Although initially novel, I expect these treatments to quickly
<br>
become common, and with common comes cheap. If the first treatments
<br>
are for &quot;popular&quot; cures, i.e. wrinkles, eyesight, baldness, etc, I
<br>
think they will find quick social exceptance. There will always be
<br>
those who refuse to accept these things, the old sequences will
<br>
take care of them in short order. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, many (most?) genetic enhancements are only useful if done at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conception time, so that the embryo may develop new or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substantially different organs (Dawkins argues that the phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of growing individuals at every generation from a monocellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embryo is one of the biggest breakthrough in the last 3 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of genetic evolution). If so, the biggest potential for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetic progress in posthumans is in making new individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, such method, by definition, cannot ever make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;previously existing individual immortal, or otherwise satisfy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone's direct selfish interest (or can it?), so that only a tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraction of genetic engineering is actually open for much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhuman progress. Yet, only selfish interest, coupled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the responsibility associated to liberty, ensures that things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;go into a consistent direction of progress. How do you envision
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the future with respect to this kind of problems?
</em><br>
<p>I think we will initially be repairing what we have, but I think
<br>
almost immediately we will start affecting the next generation in
<br>
a controlled way, not unlike the movie GATTACA. There is nothing
<br>
unusual in this, as any human behaviorist can tell you humans
<br>
select potential mates by their genetic potentials now, but in the
<br>
future it will be the difference between investing, and playing the
<br>
lottery.
<br>
<p>This is all pre-singularity of course. ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There might be lots of other scenarios.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm pretty sure this must have been discussed on the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or in some other document) in the past. I'll appreciate pointers.
</em><br>
<p>That's my $.25, I'm sure others have more to add.
