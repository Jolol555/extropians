<p><p>I can agree with this.

<p><p><em>&gt;Next, that is equivalent, in turn, to a big lookup table.

<em>&gt;(see my post yesterday of &quot;going on a hike with Eugene
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Leitl&quot; for a complete description).  That is, no information
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>This is incorrect, as all you've done is describe a finite state 
<br>
machine.  You are only considering the lookup table as being a giant 
<br>
indexed data repository in the way a dictionary is, without any concept of 
<br>
context in the way a finite state machine has context.  A lookup table that 
<br>
is an equivalent representation of a program contains entries that are data 
<br>
and/or code (the distinction being fuzzy) and all finite state machine 
<br>
programs are reducible to a lookup table.  In the pathological &quot;pure 
<br>
lookup&quot; case, each lookup changes the state of the machine which causes it 
<br>
to do yet another lookup; in practice, most lookup tables are logically 
<br>
reducible to much more compact algorithms, but the concept is still 
<br>
valid.  To reject the validity of a lookup model is to reject the 
<br>
possibility that the brain is a finite state machine.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;At each second of the hike, or of your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last 5 minutes conscious experience, we merely form a 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit address made from (i) 10 bits of input that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting at the current millisecond (ii) 20 bits specifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the state that you are in.
</em><br>
<p><p>The addressing is incorrect.  You've confused the number of clock cycles 
<br>
executed during the last five minutes (which is small) with the 
<br>
astronomical number of possible states.  You could create a hash table of 
<br>
all the states used in the last five minutes and discard the rest (so that 
<br>
you can meet your bit depth requirement), but then you would have a model 
<br>
that was perfectly useless.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Next, the billions of states making up your last 5 minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being looked up in sequence is equivalent to them being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looked up in any order.  What difference does it make if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are rearranged?
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, these billion states aren't random, each state that happens next is 
<br>
a consequence of the previous state.  Without this context (which any 
<br>
finite state machine can provide), you have no 
<br>
intelligence/consciousness/whatever.  So it all boils down to the program.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Next, this is exactly equivalent, as I think Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bradbury was getting at earlier, to having all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;billions of state simply encoded in one long string.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then I ask, why do they actually have to be fetched?
</em><br>
<p><p>Because you have to run the program at least once to know what that string 
<br>
would look like (shades of the Halting Problem).  And even then, if you 
<br>
reduced the program to that string, it would only ever be capable of doing 
<br>
the exact same thing over and over.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And this is exactly where Egan finally went, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ludicrous Theory of Dust.  Unless you balk at SOME step
</em><br>
<em>&gt;above---I balk that lookups USED EXTENSIVELY AND SOLELY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are computation, at least the kind of computation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supports consciousness---they you are led directly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ludicrous Theory of Dust.
</em><br>
<p><p>The problem with the Theory of Dust is that there is no shared context.  It 
<br>
would be the same as taking a binary program, chopping it into three parts, 
<br>
running each part on three different machines at the same time, and somehow 
<br>
having the software &quot;work&quot;.  All the pieces are there, all running on 
<br>
computers, but the best you can hope for is a core dump.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If I and those that agree with me are right, then this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a marvelous thing:  somehow (a) the cause and effect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(b) the information flow across time, are essential for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculations to be conscious.  I know it sounds crazy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but for more than ten years I've seen utterly no escape.
</em><br>
<p><p>All you are saying is that consciousness must be able to run on a finite 
<br>
state machine, which I agree with.  However, from there you take the 
<br>
concept to places that don't make any sense.  You can't logically say that 
<br>
consciousness must run on a finite state machine AND have lookup tables not 
<br>
be able to produce consciousness.  This is the same as saying that 
<br>
equivalent programs are not equivalent where consciousness is concerned, 
<br>
which I have a very hard time swallowing (a=b and a=c, but b!=c?).
<br>
<p>There is another way.
