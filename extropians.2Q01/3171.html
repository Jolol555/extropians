<em>&gt; Of course, the wish to avoid the unpleasantness surrounding

<em>&gt; Maybe I feel that way for the same reason I'm not a fan

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfyingly Darwinian ring to it!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to me, being &quot;important&quot; really has little to do with it. i regard
<br>
my life as, generally speaking, a good thing (in the sense that chocolate 
<br>
is good). so i think it stands to reason that i would choose my life over
<br>
nothing. my best inference, based on what i know now, is that whatever
<br>
society that has the technology to revive me is at least worth a short
<br>
sojourn. if i decide i don't like it, i can always kill myself then. yeah,
<br>
i might wake up a thousand years later and become an alien s/m sex slave
<br>
prevented from taking my own life ... but that could happen tomorrow too.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as to &quot;extreme measures&quot;, i don't see what's so extreme about it.
<br>
i do take the trouble to feed myself don't i? do i *deserve* that food?
<br>
all that's involved in cryonic suspension, from my perspective, is just
<br>
some paperwork. i've done as much in the way of homework just to please
<br>
teachers. if one insists on dwelling on the state of one's body after one
<br>
goes, just consider the alternative -- rotting in a box in the ground? 
<br>
ewww!

<em>&gt; Unlike HAL in _2001_, I find nothing particularly alarming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the fact that my consciousness does, in fact, cease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exist every night when I'm in delta sleep.  Nor do I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find the prospect that the universe will go on for billions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of years without me in it particularly alarming.  **Strange**,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, but no stranger than contemplating the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the unverse existed for billions of years **before** I came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into it, or contemplating the unlikelihood that I should exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all, or contemplating the fact that the person I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at age 5 or 15 has already almost altogether disappeared,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is only dimly reflected in the person I am now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I even get into moods sometimes in which I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struck by the sheer strangeness of being limited to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own conscious **perspective** on the universe -- I'm overwhelmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the thought of the sheer **simultaneity** of billions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other human beings going about their business at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exact moment, to say nothing about the trillions upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillions of other biological organisms on this planet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the unknown number of organisms, intelligent or otherwise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on other worlds throughout the universe.  I mentioned this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling once in an oddball telephone conversation I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having with a friend many years ago, saying something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like &quot;doesn't it ever make you feel **claustrophobic** to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be stuck in your own infinitesimal corner of spacetime?&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereupon my friend asked &quot;have you been dropping windowpane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acid?&quot;  ;-&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woah!! this is so cool! i feel like this, like, all the time! it's
<br>
like, i slap myself from time to time and say &quot;i'm *me*!! how did i get
<br>
here?&quot;
