</em><br>
<p>Good points.  My interpretation is that the Extropian &quot;prime directive&quot; 
<br>
and our consensus morality of decent behavior towards concious entities
<br>
imply we can't ethically create the kinds of experimental/historical sims 
<br>
we've been discussing.  If we create a sim with concious entities we must 
<br>
treat them like we would treat each other, i.e., cive them access to 
<br>
info about the world, provide them access to self-enhancement, etc.
<br>
Hal was making this point.
<br>
<p>If it's just recording data about the past, I don't see ethical issues with
<br>
erasing it.  Conciousness is a process, not a state.  If we inherit 
<br>
data equivalents of corpsicles we have to treat them with respect
<br>
to the intents of those who had themselves frozen, provided they
<br>
provided adequate resources in their wills.  We may choose to do 
<br>
more, but them it becomes charity, not required.  If you create or collect
<br>
data, it's still just data and property, unless you turn on a sim using
<br>
that data, in which case concious data &quot;should&quot; become its own 
<br>
propert.
