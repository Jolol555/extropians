<p>I did NOT write that article.  I forwarded it.:)

<p><em>&gt; &gt;Many media pundits compare the business cycle to a party in which the
</em><br>
host
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(the central bank) takes away the punch bowl (raises interest rates) just
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the party (the boom) is really getting underway. The idea is that tight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;money and credit policies trigger recessions. Ergo, loose or easy credit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;policy is the way to prevent a recession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not entirely fair to that recession model; the assumption is that the
</em><br>
central
<br>
<em>&gt; bank does so to stop or end inflation.
</em><br>
<p>I think John Cochran's point is that if you avoid the initial inflation, you
<br>
don't get the need to stop or end it.
<br>
<p>(For the record, I don't entirely agree with Cochran, especially in his
<br>
assumption that zero growth in the money supply is necessary to end
<br>
inflation.  I think he's hinting at a 100% reserve regime being the only
<br>
solution.  I disagree with this.  I think free market banking is the
<br>
ultimate solution and this type of banking will almost definitely be
<br>
fractional reserve.  The difference between free market banking and today's
<br>
system?  Each bank would set it's own reserve requirements and pay for its
<br>
mistakes.  Inflating (having less reserves than necessary to deal with
<br>
day-to-day needs and a buffer for some deviations) risks the bank going
<br>
under.  Deflating (having more reserves than necessary to deal with
<br>
day-to-day needs and a buffer for some deviations) means lower profits and
<br>
less business than other banks.  The feedback would be immediate and banks
<br>
would act just like other businesses, having an incentive to manage their
<br>
assets comptently or going under if they don't.  This would be radically
<br>
different than central banks or even 100% reserve systems.  See George A.
<br>
Selgin's _The Theory of Free Banking: Money Supply Under Competitive Note
<br>
Issue_ for more on the subject.  See also Kevin Dowd's short list of works
<br>
on free banking at <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/~var/kd-pub-bank.htm">http://www.shef.ac.uk/~var/kd-pub-bank.htm</a> )
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;In contrast, the Austrian business cycle theory traces the cause of
</em><br>
economic
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;recession (bust) back to the beginning of the party (the boom). The host
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;guilty, not of taking away the punch bowl and spoiling the party, but of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;spiking the punch and thus causing many of the partygoers to suffer from
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unanticipated hangover.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both the &quot;stop inflation&quot; (party pooper) and the &quot;malinvestment&quot;
</em><br>
(hangover)
<br>
<em>&gt; models of recession are quite old.
</em><br>
<p>Cochran cites von Mises who had elaborated that model in his 1949 book
<br>
_Human Action_.  I'm not sure of the history of it, BUT Cochran makes no
<br>
claim that he just thought of it yesterday.  At the same time, a theory's
<br>
being not new does not make it wrong.  Nor does it being new make it right
<br>
(or more right than older theories).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The economist just had an article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (March 10, 2001, p 67-70) speculating that the US has generally had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;party pooper&quot; recessions since WWII but now is due for a &quot;hangover&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In your metaphor,
</em><br>
<p>Whoa!  It's not MY metaphor.  It's Cochran's.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the punch *has been* spiked, but the host (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fed) pulls the punch when the guest start getting rowdy, and they never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get drunk enough for a hangover. Now that the Fed has gotten quite good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at managing inflation,
</em><br>
<p>I dispute this claim.  By what measure has the Fed managed inflation?
<br>
Stephen Horwitz points out in his recent book _Microfoundations and
<br>
Macroeconomics: An Austrian Perspective_, the total costs of inflation are
<br>
much than higher than the conventional measures.  If this is so, then even
<br>
so called &quot;low inflation&quot; regimes might be causing much more damage to the
<br>
capital structure -- making it less sustainable -- than is commonly thought.
<br>
This would, to some extent, explain why even periods of low inflation lead
<br>
to all kinds of financial maladies.  (More information on this book is
<br>
available at <a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Book/Book.htm">http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Book/Book.htm</a>  See also his &quot;The
<br>
Costs of Inflation Revisited,&quot; which is to appear in _The Review of Austrian
<br>
Economics_ and a draft is now available online at
<br>
<a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/wpmain.htm">http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/wpmain.htm</a>  Some of the arguments he uses
<br>
in the book also appear in this article.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we've had a boom run on long enough for serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malinvestment (e.g. internet mania) and now we're due for a hangover.
</em><br>
<p>It's not, as you might be suggesting, that a little inflation is okay.
<br>
There are unrecoverable costs of inflating period, mainly because of how any
<br>
change in monetary equilibrium does not evenly flow through the economy.
<br>
Certain people benefit from inflation immediately, while others get burned.
<br>
Even deflating afterward -- assuming one does not overdeflate, which causes
<br>
other irreversible damage as well -- does not undo this.  Horwitz goes over
<br>
this in detail in his book.  He has a chapter dedicated to inflation and
<br>
another dedicated to deflation.  I highly recommend it.  (I'm working on a
<br>
review...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The economist observes that Japan's malaise of the 90's (which still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continues) is a hangover type recession, which indicates how bad they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be.  IMO Japan's trouble qualifies as a depression, albeit mild and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drawn-out.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know enough about the Japanese example, though I think there several
<br>
problems with government intervention there, including a long period of
<br>
inflation, price rigidities (set by law), and massive subsidies.  All of
<br>
these make it very hard for that economy to readjust itself.  Recall just a
<br>
decade ago, Japan was the marvel of the world and many in the US feared they
<br>
would soon be working for Japanese companies...
<br>
<p>Cheers!
