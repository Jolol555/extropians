<p>I'm sure there's a lot of anthropological work that has nothing to do with
<br>
Mead and is not influenced by her.  Anthropology is one of the primary
<br>
sources of empirical data for evolutionary psychology.  (Which is a bit
<br>
unnerving, actually; if anthropology has been that screwed up by politics
<br>
before, I must consider the possibility that it is presently being screwed
<br>
up by the same forces, and that some of the data underlying evolutionary
<br>
psychology is false.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No one in the field has ever held her up as some sort of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Okay.  I think the statement that &quot;No one in anthropology has ever held up
<br>
Margaret Mead as an icon&quot; is simply wrong.  Perhaps nobody holds her up as
<br>
an icon today; she was certainly an icon in the past.
