<p>
How do extropians envision transition from mankind
<br>
to whatever posthuman future awaits us?
<br>
What are the documented scenarios that have been considered?
<br>
<p>I mean, afaik, historically, genetic replacement happens by massive
<br>
extinction of species in very short times (geologicallywise, anyway),
<br>
with the surviving ones filling the void (that they might or not have
<br>
caused, to begin with). Do you expect some posthuman species to just sit
<br>
around (maybe in secret) and takeover the planet after some inevitable
<br>
catastrophe wipes mankind? I don't think the humans would let such thing
<br>
happen -- if they're going to be destroyed, they won't hesitate to make
<br>
the planet unliveable. Or maybe other planets would be a shelter to
<br>
posthumans, where they'd wait for the final demise of mankind?
<br>
<p>If not, this might mean a completely different way for species to emerge
<br>
than have been seen in the past. Do you expect genetic enhancement to
<br>
become so cheap that just about every human will eventually have been
<br>
modified? Would that result into a sustainable species? How long do you
<br>
expect it for the transition to take? Won't the biggest brake to such
<br>
transition be public opinion and traditional religion? Or would
<br>
there be such invisible riskless individual enhancements that people
<br>
would first use them undercover until it becomes so common that
<br>
prejudices be gone?
<br>
<p>Also, many (most?) genetic enhancements are only useful if done at
<br>
conception time, so that the embryo may develop new or substantially
<br>
different organs (Dawkins argues that the phenomenon of growing individuals
<br>
at every generation from a monocellular embryo is one of the biggest
<br>
breakthrough in the last 3 billion years of genetic evolution).
<br>
If so, the biggest potential for genetic progress in posthumans
<br>
is in making new individuals. However, such method, by definition,
<br>
cannot ever make any previously existing individual immortal, or
<br>
otherwise satisfy anyone's direct selfish interest (or can it?),
<br>
so that only a tiny fraction of genetic engineering is actually open
<br>
for much transhuman progress. Yet, only selfish interest, coupled
<br>
with the responsibility associated to liberty, ensures that things
<br>
go into a consistent direction of progress. How do you envision the
<br>
future with respect to this kind of problems?
<br>
<p>There might be lots of other scenarios.
<br>
I'm pretty sure this must have been discussed on the list
<br>
(or in some other document) in the past. I'll appreciate pointers.
<br>

To appreciate an intelligent man is to have some pleasure when one agrees

with him, and to have an instructive pleasure when one does not.
