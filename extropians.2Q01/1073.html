</em><br>
<p>Why not?  As I've implied, existing in a simulation is
<br>
better than not existing at all.

<p><em>&gt; You may be able to arrange the hierarchy of realities such

</em><br>
<p>Okay, so I've handicapped them.  But, they're my creations.
<br>
Surely you don't expect me to share my wealth with them?
<br>
I don't even share my wealth with other U.S. citizens,
<br>
and they are on an equal footing with me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you take the position that &quot;No, old conscious entities that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only get 1 clock tick per trillion years may *never* be erased&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you clearly set a limit on your own forward self-evolution&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The solution to these quandaries is the same very
<br>
simple solution that societies have evolved to the
<br>
consternation of social planners, namely, private
<br>
property.
<br>
<p>I can do what I want with my computronium, and you
<br>
can do what you want with yours, unless others decide
<br>
with weight of numbers to use force against us.  I
<br>
think that we've learned from history that this is
<br>
a bad idea, and that prosperity and progress arise
<br>
from respect for private property.
<br>
<p>Your job is to infect me with memes, e.g., &quot;respect
<br>
your simulations and allot them what resources you
<br>
can&quot;, and my job is to infect you with memes, e.g.,
<br>
&quot;respect the private property of others and demand
<br>
that they respect yours&quot;.  In my opinion, this is
<br>
better than trying to lay down rules.
