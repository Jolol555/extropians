Robert J. Bradbury wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that the SI is writing the code that 'operates' the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telepresence body/holo, I would argue that it can prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it from ever becoming self-conscious.  You simply execute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the common standard behaviors based on similar situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and random behavior selector strategies for the rarer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations (not too different from your standard issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human as far as I can tell).
</em><br>
<p>I'm unclear what you mean here:  if you mean &quot;telepresence&quot;,
<br>
then, as you know, we don't have a zombie; telepresence is
<br>
just another &quot;skin&quot; for the operator.  (One might as well
<br>
suppose that one's body is a zombie, operated by the real
<br>
brain inside.)
<br>
<p>But if you mean that the SI has downloaded the code, and
<br>
the alleged zombie is now independent, well, this is where
<br>
Dennett, I, and the others may be going out on a limb, for
<br>
we maintain that no mattter how advanced the SI, and no
<br>
matter how sophisticated the code that gets downloaded into
<br>
the alleged zombie, the resulting creature must be conscious,
<br>
etc., and not a zombie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But 'feelings' are gentico-socio-'thingys' (insert a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here to represent a neurocomputational 'pattern') that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to promote survival.  There is no reason to elevate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to significance (if that is what you are doing).  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are subroutines designed to promote behaviors that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific goal seeking strategies in the framework of the system.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah ha, so here a zombie cannot be 'tele-operated'.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if a non-tele-operated creature does not have 'feelings' that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote its survival, then it's very rapidly a dead zombie.
</em><br>
<p>You've said it better than I did!  Exactly!  &quot;Behavior
<br>
identical to (at least) human&quot; certainly includes the
<br>
ability to survive in non-trivial environments.  So now
<br>
if the (alleged) zombie can interact in sophisticated
<br>
ways, it (we claim) knows fear and other emotions, and
<br>
also turns out to be conscious, i.e., not a zombie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I don't buy the impossible/nonsensical part.  With the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical correlation and fuzzy logic capabilities that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we now have, do you not think we could produce fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional unrecognizable zombies with no consciousness?
</em><br>
<p>No, because it is precisely our claim that such efforts will
<br>
inadvertently, but necessarily produce systems that include
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot;, feelings, and so on, though, as I said above,
<br>
at this juncture the burden of plausibility falls on us to
<br>
say exactly why such efforts will always fail.
<br>
<p>But I think that it's already been explained by Dennett and
<br>
others, although I may have to get into the details.  For
<br>
now, one key observation is that all complex animals, which
<br>
are capable of a very wide range of behaviors, e.g., apes,
<br>
dogs, and elephants, appear to be consious.  So if zombies
<br>
could exist, why didn't nature ever make any?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the AOL-Eliza example demonstrates that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is feasible based on much simpler principles.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting figure-of-merit is the time it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals of various IQs or educations to recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are talking to a non-conscious entity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but surviving cursory examination by AOL members,
<br>
which is only on-line and not real-world anyway, is
<br>
hardly much of a challenge.  I agree, instead, with
<br>
what you wrote earlier:  &quot;if a... creature does not
<br>
have 'feelings' that promote its survival, then it's
<br>
very rapidly a dead [creature]&quot;.  Same goes for 
<br>
consciousness, I think.
<br>
<p>Robert added two more paragraphs that penetrated into
<br>
the heart of the matter even further, which I'll try
<br>
to reply to later.
