<p>Ideally, you want to find good works which tie in with the purposes 
<br>
of TH--not just for convenience and economic efficiency, but because 
<br>
of American cynicism in general. 
<br>
<p>Now, tell the truth--what do you think when you see a newsreel of 
<br>
some rich and famous actress ladling out soup in a homeless shelter? 
<br>
If you're like most, you laugh. Big deal, she's there for 20 minutes 
<br>
and goes back to her mansion in Bev Hills. Even donating money to 
<br>
some cause (typically chosen in cooperation with a pubulicist/PR 
<br>
firm, believe it or not) appears to be just some effort at looking 
<br>
good. Sadly, this is true even if the intention is sincere, because 
<br>
it's a very cynical society.
<br>
<p>NOW--what do you think when you find out that Celine Dion is active 
<br>
with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, does benefit concerts for them 
<br>
(That's some serious bucks)--and has for many, many years, because 
<br>
her NIECE DIED of CF? Whole different thing, isn't it?
<br>
<p>If you find causes which are logically connected to TH, you will 
<br>
avoid the cynical reaction AND naturally draw attention to TH because 
<br>
of the connection--which makes an interesting tie-in for the media.
<br>
<p>One example: People with severely damaged or severed spinal cords. 
<br>
You must however avoid or downplay the head-swapping-on-live-bodies 
<br>
association. The research could also be applicable to the development 
<br>
and control of artificial or partially artificial bodies--which could 
<br>
in turn be a stopgap measure to keep the head going while the body is 
<br>
cooled for future reunification. This is two minutes' thought; there 
<br>
are doubtless many, many other possible good causes.
<br>
<p>jm
<br>
<p>Make sense?
