<em>&gt; Correct me if wrong ...... maybe someone can summon Jesus to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visible appearance ... or persuade Mohammed to float back down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the clouds to proof the 'truth' of religious after-life claims &amp;c.
</em><br>

<p>Since no one knows what Jesus looked like (he could have been a gay black
<br>
hippie freak, or at least he could have played one on TV), I guess one
<br>
would need to employ one's pineal third eye to see him clearly. &lt;pshaw!&gt;
<br>
The voice of Mohammed must have been beautifully persuasive (as the
<br>
superstar rock idol of his time), harmoniously combining the poesy of the
<br>
language with a compelling outline of the culture... with a bit of
<br>
yodeling. &lt;hock-tooey!&gt;
<br>
<p>If one gets down with memes identical to those of ancient masters of
<br>
enlightenment, identical patterns of rhythm and views of identical claims,
<br>
etc.,  ...identical neuronal connections and processes could emerge which
<br>
effectively clone or reincarnate the &quot;truth&quot; revealed to ancient mystics.
<br>
So what? Everybody still gets stoned in the same old ways (eating moldy
<br>
rye bread and psychedelic mushrooms instead of taking postmodern
<br>
psychoactive ecstasy drugs isn't much of a change), and everybody still
<br>
has their own brand of soap to sell. Can adults feel exactly the way they
<br>
felt as children? According to Dean Martin, &quot;It happens all the time... If
<br>
you're young at heart.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you really want to summon Jesus, or Mohammed, or Zarathustra &quot;to
<br>
visible appearance,&quot; you aim too low; you aspire to mediocrity. Why not do
<br>
something marvelously extropic instead... Why not become as enlightened as
<br>
Jesus, as virtuoso as Mohammed, or as godly as Zarathustra? Then you can
<br>
feel exactly like they felt, know precisely what they knew, and see the
<br>
universe where you began as if for the first time.
<br>
<p>ô¿ô
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
<br>
free will
