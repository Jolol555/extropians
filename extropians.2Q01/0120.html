<p>
Despite massive dips in many portfolios, investors
<br>
largely remain bullish, market experts say.
<br>
<p>So what's wrong with that?
<br>
<p>If investors are extremely upbeat about the market,
<br>
a _downturn_ is likely coming. When they're
<br>
extremely negative, an _upturn_ is imminent.
<br>
<p>In the 'Investors Intelligence' weekly survey we read
<br>
that 57.4 percent are bulls, 30.9 percent are bears and
<br>
11.7 percent are short-term bears and long-term bulls.
<br>
<p>The normal range for a bull market is 45 percent bulls,
<br>
35 percent bears and 20 percent for the rest, said M. Burke,
<br>
its editor. That means today's investor is far more positive
<br>
than normal. A bad sign for the market.
<br>
<p>The readings are still near the bullish levels
<br>
seen in January 1987: nine months before the October
<br>
crash. At that time, 61.8 percent of advisers were
<br>
bulls and 14 percent were bears.
<br>
<p>A bear market is said to end when at least 55 percent
<br>
of investors are glum about the outlook.
<br>
For example, in late 1994 when the Dow Jones I.A.
<br>
was at 3,700, the 59 percent of adviser were bears
<br>
for two weeks in a row, the highest percentage in
<br>
12 years, M. Burke said. But it marked a market bottom
<br>
and set the stage for the long robust rally.
<br>
<p>Right now, investors whose portfolios have been hit
<br>
figure it's too late to sell. So they're holding on
<br>
and not panicking. If the market drops more this year
<br>
that's when real pessimism sets in.
<br>
<p>The 'Investors Intelligence' began its survey in 1965.
<br>
Its premise was that the majority ruled: if more people
<br>
were bullish, that's how the market would go. It turned
<br>
out that advisors tended to be wrong. Hence, the survey
<br>
became a contrary indicator.

Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy,
<br>
vitalism, mind, free will
<br>
<p>and what about investors intelligence?
