<p>Not necessarily.  Many societies exist quite handily in places with weather that
<br>
would be considered eternal drought elsewhere.  Partially that is about water
<br>
management.
<br>
<p>You're right in that a society in otherwise lush pastures that had a long-term
<br>
major drought would have to make some changes.

<p>If you go up to a raw stalk of wheat and shuck the wheat seeds from the clump on
<br>
the end, throw it in the air a couple times so that the chaff blows away, and
<br>
then chew the seeds for a while and it becomes like gum, basically the mucilage
<br>
in the wheat.  It's a bland gum.  Eat a mint leaf.  To pull potatoes, disturb
<br>
the earth around the plant a bit and then pull the entire plant with the
<br>
potatoes from the ground, and shake the plant to shake off most of the earth.
<br>
Raspberries and some other types of berries are nice perennials, they sure taste
<br>
good when they're warm from the sun.
<br>
<p>I was told that in the East that chickens were fed fish byproducts, thus that
<br>
the chicken tasted like fish.  Yuck.  After catching fish, cleaning and fileting
<br>
them is a simple enough matter, if messy.  If you ever catch some mutant,
<br>
diseased fish, report it to the authorities.
<br>
<p>Rotate crops responsibly.
<br>
<p>Is there a simple home test for various substances?  Perhaps what I have in mind
<br>
is a kitchen gas chromatograph.
