<p>Yes, yes, mea culpa, I have to admit I'm a sucker for
<br>
the stuff.  My film-buff friend, when I get on his nerves,
<br>
calls me a &quot;toadying Anglophile&quot; and a &quot;Masterpiece Theater
<br>
queen&quot;.  ;-&gt;

<p><em>&gt; If Great Brains arrive before people have access to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultra-smart AI SI,...  some would want to take over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.
</em><br>
<p>Which is exactly what they do in _Last and First Men_:
<br>
<p>&quot;At the last moment the Great Brains were able to put into the
<br>
field an army of... perfect slaves, which they equipped with
<br>
the most efficient lethal weapons.  The remnant of original
<br>
servants discovered too late that they had been helping to produce
<br>
their supplanters.  They joined the rebels, only to share in the
<br>
general destruction.  In a few months all the Third Men, save the
<br>
new docile variety, were destroyed; except for a few specimens
<br>
which were preserved in cages for experimental purposes.  And in a
<br>
few years every type of animal that was not known to be directly
<br>
or indirectly necessary to human life had been exterminated.
<br>
None were preserved even as specimens, for the Great Brains had
<br>
already studied them through and through...
<br>
<p>For the Fourth Men, the Great Brains, there was no possible
<br>
life but the life of intellect; and the life of intellect had
<br>
become barren.  Evidently something more than mere bulk of
<br>
brain was needed for the solving of the deeper intellectual
<br>
problems...  They must learn somehow to remake their own
<br>
brain-tissues upon a new plan.  With this aim, and partly through
<br>
unwitting jealousy of the natural and more balanced species
<br>
which had created them, they began to use their captive
<br>
specimens of that species for a great new enterprise of
<br>
research...
<br>
<p>Little by little the Fourth Men began to realize that what was
<br>
wrong with themselves was not merely their intellectual
<br>
limitation, but, far more seriously, the limitation of their
<br>
insight into values.  And this weakness, they saw, was the
<br>
result, not of paucity of intellective brain, but of paucity
<br>
of body and lower brain tissues.  This defect they could not
<br>
remedy.  It was obviously impossible to remake themselves so
<br>
radically that they should become of a more normal type.
<br>
Should they concentrate their efforts upon the production of
<br>
new individuals more harmonious than themselves?  Such a work,
<br>
it might be supposed, would have seemed unattractive to them.
<br>
But no.  They argued thus:  'It is our nature to care most
<br>
for knowing.  Full knowledge is to be attained only by minds
<br>
both more penetrating and more broadly based than ours.  Let
<br>
us, therefore, waste no more time in seeking to achieve the
<br>
goal in ourselves.  Let us seek rather to produce a kind
<br>
of being, free from our limitations, in whom we may attain the
<br>
goal of perfect knowledge vicariously.  The producing of such
<br>
a being will exercise all our powers, and will afford the
<br>
highest kind of fulfillment possible to us.  To refrain from
<br>
this work would be irrational.'
<br>
<p>Thus it came about that the artificial Fourth Men began to
<br>
work in a new spirit upon the surviving specimens of the
<br>
Third Men to produce their own supplanters.&quot;
