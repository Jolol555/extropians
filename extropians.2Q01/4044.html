<em>&gt; Heh.  Well, that's your decision.  Just bear in mind that where an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academic field has been corrupted by political influences, it's very easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for people who have been working there for &quot;decades&quot; to be totally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flagrantly, utterly wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of political influences, it is possible for people who have been
<br>
working on something for decades to be totally, flagrantly, utterly wrong.
<br>
That is the nature of science and any other intellectual endeavor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd trust an amateur reader of &quot;The Adapted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mind&quot; over any academic trained in the &quot;soft&quot; social sciences when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes to knowing, for example, &quot;whether the brain has domain specificity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or is a general learning machine&quot;, because it is known that the standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social sciences model is blatantly untrue, for political reasons, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to that particular question.
</em><br>
<p>This strikes me as a rather absurd statement.  I grew up around academics
<br>
trained in the social sciences and I can assure you that they hold a very
<br>
wide variety of views -- much wider, for example, than the set of views
<br>
represented on this e-mail list.
<br>
<p>In fact this statement of your strikes me as a flagrantly wrong attitude
<br>
that is directly attributable to corruption by political influences ;&gt;
<br>
<p>I don't like Political Correctness any more than you, but nor do I like glib
<br>
stereotyping of social groups with which the stereotyper lacks detailed
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p>Sorry if I'm being touchy -- my dad is a social scientist, and he actually
<br>
isn't the ONLY one out there who's not a complete idiot....  There is  LOT
<br>
of idiocy in the social sciences, to be sure -- my dad recently wrote a
<br>
paper arguing that about 90% of statistical work ever done in sociology has
<br>
been useless.  But there is also a lot of good work and solid thinking, by
<br>
people of both liberal and conservative persuasions.
