<em>&gt;From: <a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Made%20in%20China&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104162038.NAA15288@well.com&gt;">hal@finney.org</a>

<p><em>&gt;It's a good idea, but why stop there?  How about a &quot;Made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nebraska&quot; store for Nebraskans, and similarly for other states?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;rest of satire edited for brevity&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Hopefully the fallacy here is clear: the advantage of trade is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it allows people in different areas to specialize in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different things. This is more efficient and less wasteful than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to do everything locally.  The wider the range of talents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and resources available, the greater are the opportunities for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;finding the best possible match of people and production.  Trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a worldwide basis maximizes available resources for everyone.
</em><br>
<p>I never said anything against trade, and the things you said above
<br>
only apply to FAIR trade. Exporting manufacturing offshore to
<br>
places that have little or no effective protection for the average
<br>
citizen is bad for everyone involved.
<br>
<p>Sweatshops are wrong no matter where they are located.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The most efficient system is one where you buy the goods that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cheapest, regardless of where they are produced.  Anything else is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just throwing money away.  You're hurting yourself and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around you by boycotting trade opportunities.
</em><br>
<p>It's not where they are produced, it's HOW they are produced, and
<br>
sweatshop products are harmfull to humanity at any price, no matter
<br>
how low.
<br>
<p>I have nothing against products from other places, in fact my most
<br>
prized possession is my Swiss army knife, and pocket watch. (okay
<br>
and my gold Waltham 1867 pocket watch and Dunhill lighter)
<br>
<p>I am arguing that a country should maintain core competencies in
<br>
the basics of life, it should grow as much of it's own food as
<br>
possible (and economical), it should produce much of it's own
<br>
clothing.
<br>
<p>I think it is a very good idea that Americans travel more, and
<br>
learn from other cultures. A pint of Guinness in downtown Chicago
<br>
is not the same as a pint in Dublin.
<br>
<p>Exploiting third world labor to try to maintain our lifestyles is
<br>
inherently bad for us.
