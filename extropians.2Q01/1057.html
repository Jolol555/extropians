<em>&gt; Its fascinating if you go over this design.  You have the U.S.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the the Mir or Spacelab?  Have you looked at the prices that NASA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipates charging for the hourly allocation of an astronaut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a &quot;lab operator&quot;?  Makes hourly rates for lawyers and doctors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look positively &quot;minimum wage&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Even NASA is not immune from the temptation to the sorts of abuses
<br>
(deliberate or not) that monopolies incur.  And let's face it: even if
<br>
they don't actively try to knock potential competitors out (and despite
<br>
what some say, I don't think they do), the extremely high barrier to
<br>
entry means they are a de facto monopoly on this kind of stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The whole thing has a bad smell.  In contrast if you positioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as an orbiting observatory platform or an &quot;assembly&quot; operation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you would be getting something from it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer this -- why can't one attach a couple of dozen Baby Hubble's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the space station?  Is there some orbital difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Hubble and the ISS that makes it unusable as an observatory?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it simply not stable enough?  What gives here?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Beauraucratic inefficiency&quot;.  Money is almost no object to their
<br>
planners, but safety is, so their desired point on the &quot;cheaper/safer&quot;
<br>
curve is where most businesses would not even bother drawing a
<br>
gradation and just label, &quot;goes to infinity here&quot;.  Plus, efficiency
<br>
does not give them as high a payback as it would if they might actually
<br>
lose customers due to having high costs.  They do many things well,
<br>
just not economics.
