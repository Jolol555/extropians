<p>Problem is, as much as many of us are focused on dealing with the problems 
<br>
of the day, we are all to some extent or another looking forward to the day 
<br>
when our hopes for the future become reality.  My guess is that for most on 
<br>
this list that hope for the future is summed up in the term &quot;Singularity.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some have said that predicting what follows the Singularity is akin to 
<br>
predicting what becomes of the laws of physics past the event horizon of a 
<br>
black hole.  Maybe so, I don't know.  But it does seem to me that the best 
<br>
hope for solution to problems that so far seem intractible (religious 
<br>
hatred, world hunger, poverty, incurable disease, etc.) would be the 
<br>
application of a good dose of super-intelligent friendly AI.
<br>
<p>Of course nothing's guaranteed.  And (despite Eli's assurances) I'm not sure 
<br>
we'll be able to persuade a being whose own intelligence dwarfs our 
<br>
collective intelligence to put our interests ahead of (or even on a par 
<br>
with) its own interests.  And I'm not saying &quot;Hey let's give up trying to 
<br>
solve our problems because Eli &amp; Co. are in fact going to make HAL our pal 
<br>
and HAL will then solve everything.&quot;  But I am saying: try as you might to 
<br>
cure AIDS and talk some sense to those idiots in the middle east, you may 
<br>
well find in the end only our pal HAL can come up with workable solutions.
