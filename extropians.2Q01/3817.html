<em>&gt;Brent Allsop asked, in effect, &quot;How do you respond to an atheist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who points out a similarity between believing that cryonics might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work (it's a better chance than nothing) and believing in Pascal's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wager (you have everything to win if He does exist, but nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to lose if He does not)?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>(1)  I find Pascal's Wager somewhat ironic in that many Christians consider 
<br>
gambling sinful, or at least a sign of weak character.
<br>
<p>(2)  Pascal assumes that Materialism/Atheism and Catholic Christianity are 
<br>
the only options.  But in the real world of human history and culture, it's 
<br>
extremely unlikely that one gets born in a predominantly Catholic society.  
<br>
For example, a few months back I met a graduate endrinology student who had 
<br>
grown up in a Zoroastrian household (parents having migrated from Iran to 
<br>
the U.S.), and I realized that it's only a historical accident that people 
<br>
in Western Europe inherited the Judeo-Christian set of arbitrary beliefs 
<br>
about the supernatural instead of  those of other religions.  Perhaps if 
<br>
Alexander the Great, and later the Muslims, hadn't been so effective in 
<br>
persecuting the Zoroastrian religion, Western philosophers and theologians 
<br>
would have spent their lives debating arguments about the existence and 
<br>
theodicies of Ahura Mazda versus Ahriman.
<br>
<p>(3)  As for cryonics, I suspect that we aren't going to get a set of 
<br>
discrete outcomes as simple as life versus death.  The patients' 
<br>
revivability and identity-conservation are going to fall into some kind of 
<br>
distribution from poor to excellent.
<br>
<p>Trans-millennially yours,
