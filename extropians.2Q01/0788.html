<em>&gt; &gt; But all this would be a waste of effort if those who want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; play this game dont have matlab.  For all its disadvantages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Microsloth excel is a package that is already owned by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pretty much everyone who cares about that sorta thing. spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Eugene Leitl thinks] the disadvantage (that Redmond owns the source) pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nukes all the advantages. You need NumPy? Just download it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not just propaganda. OpenSource software is better, at least for most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values of users on the long run.
</em><br>
<p>'Gene is absolutely right.  I was going off in the wrong direction by
<br>
pi radians.  If we want to put up software that anyone can use for
<br>
calculating orbit mechanics, it should be in open source.  Matlab
<br>
has some truly wicked toolboxes, but for what we want to do here,
<br>
we dont need those.  What Im thinking about here is for extropians
<br>
to be able to make first order calcs on any wacky space idea that
<br>
they think of, such as: what is the required mass fraction of a rocket
<br>
in LEO to get to Gaspra?  How long does it take?  How much
<br>
penalty for shaving 15% off the travel time? etc.
<br>
<p>I wrote up a spreadsheet today that calculates delta vees required
<br>
to do Hohmann transfer orbits out of LEO and out to some arbitrary
<br>
number of AU.  Robert has been after me for this for months, and
<br>
Ive just gotten off my lazy ass and did it today.  Anyone wants that,
<br>
post me offlist and Ill send it on.  Then some opensource guru can
<br>
extract the equations and put it in NumPy, etc.
<br>
<p>Now that Im thinking about this, lets plan a side session after Extro5,
<br>
elect a leader such as Robert, a software guru who understands how
<br>
to organize a modular package, and have that person assign and collect
<br>
the modules that we will need to plan engineering projects that are
<br>
specifically extropian oriented.  For instance, we could write a
<br>
package that deals with the various aspects of an M-Brain, how
<br>
much material is needed, how the station keeping would be
<br>
accomplished, etc.  We could have a list of known asteroids
<br>
that can be taken apart.  {Im still one of those heretics that
<br>
believes there is enough material in the asteroid belt to construct
<br>
a reasonable first generation M-brain.  The second generation
<br>
M-brain would use up the planets.}  We would make a list
<br>
of modules needed, then assign them to those that are cluey
<br>
in each area.
<br>
<p>Better yet, we dont need to wait until E5, and furthermore
<br>
many valuable contributors may not be able to attend that
<br>
meeting.  So lets start it now, by answering these questions:
<br>
<p>1)  What open source language do we use?
<br>
2)  How is this software package to be accessed?
<br>
3)  What architecture?
<br>
4)  Are there existing open source components that
<br>
we could incorporate?
<br>
5)  Are we looking a simulation of some sort?
<br>
6)  What kind of user interface?  Graphic?  etc.
