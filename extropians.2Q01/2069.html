<p>Ross' comment makes the assumption that entropy is not a
<br>
conserved quantity over a cycle of big-bang-to-whatever-
<br>
-happens-afterwards-to-the-next-big-bang.  Would we not
<br>
start the entropy clock over each each cycle?  As far as I
<br>
know, this is an open question.
<br>
<p>The notion brings back fond memories of college modern
<br>
physics when a number of students debated this until we
<br>
were exhausted.  All we finally agreed upon is that if the
<br>
universe is closed, then *everything* occupies a finite
<br>
amount of space-time with a finite number of particles
<br>
in a finite number of quantum states.  (The term finite
<br>
is stretched to the limit of course, since it describes
<br>
quantities that are unimaginable large.)
<br>
<p>Then the reasoning goes thus: if the universe is closed, then it
<br>
is subject to eventual collapse, and since everything that can
<br>
happen must happen, then another big bang must eventually
<br>
occur, much different the next time of course.  By the same
<br>
reasoning, it must recur an infinite number of times, so
<br>
eventually one of the previous states must recur as well, since
<br>
the total number of possibilities is finite.
<br>
<p>Followed to its logical extreme, one concludes if the universe
<br>
is closed, we have been here before, having this exact
<br>
discussion.  Furthermore we have been here an *infinite*
<br>
number of times before.  Still further, we will be here again,
<br>
having this exact discussion and an unimaginably large number
<br>
of similar but slightly different versions thereof.  Thinking about
<br>
it causes one to zone out.  Amara has so aptly described
<br>
the feeling as staring into the abyss until it stares back.
<br>
<p>The students did eventually agree on this mind boggling point,
<br>
so we then asked ourselves what if the universe is open?
<br>
I dropped out at that point, saying that this possibility is too
<br>
sad to even consider.  {8-]  spike
