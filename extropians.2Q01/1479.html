</em><br>
<p>Right on, Randy!  And it's not just foreigners you all should be worried
<br>
about.
<br>
For too long, employer's in high-wage states like California have
<br>
imported cheap IT labor,
<br>
from nearby low-wage states like Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Arizona, and
<br>
New Mexico.  These cheap non-California laborers are willing to work
<br>
longer for less money, thereby driving down wages for all Californian
<br>
programmers.
<br>
<p>Older programmers are hardest hit--these out-of-state
<br>
programmers have often already learned the most up to date, useful
<br>
programming
<br>
skills, either in their in state universities, or on their own.  As a
<br>
result, greedy employers often refuse to pay to retrain older
<br>
programmers, or pay them higher salaries.
<br>
<p>Some of these out-of-state
<br>
nationals are so happy to be off the dairy farm, that they're willing
<br>
to work under sweat shop conditions in &quot;cubicle farms.&quot;  No cappucino
<br>
machines, no free sodas--it's completely unacceptable.
<br>
<p>We should set up mini-INS's in each state, and
<br>
require all out-of-state nationals who want to work in high-wage states
<br>
like California to
<br>
apply for new visa, which I propose to call a C1-B.  Then we must set
<br>
quotas for each state.  We
<br>
might allow say, 1000 Idaho programmers each year to enter California to
<br>
<p>work.  Of course, they can only work for companies that sponsor them,
<br>
and when their employment ends, we must truck them back to Idaho (or
<br>
whereever).
<br>
<p>The citizens of California are all effectively shareholder's in the
<br>
state of California.       California citizens have got to protect
<br>
California programmer's jobs, keep their salaries high, and protect
<br>
their standard of living.   It's insane to allow open borders between
<br>
California and these low-wage states.
<br>
<p>Those who speak out against open intra-state borders have too often been
<br>
demonized as economic rubes.   We're not trying to establish cartels for
<br>
ourselves to protect our high salaries at the expense of everyone
<br>
else--we're simply responsible shareholders who demand that our
<br>
competitors get our permission before they can set up shop.
<br>
<p>It's time to stop being afraid to say that the pink elephant of open
<br>
borders may be bad for your wallet.
