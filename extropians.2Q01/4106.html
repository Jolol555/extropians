<p><em>&gt; Many here would argue that this

<p>If this is true, it may explain why I am not quite willing to say &quot;I am an
<br>
Extropian,&quot; while as the same time sharing many of the same interests and
<br>
values. I'm all for my own individual autonomy and freedom (particularly from
<br>
death), but am also concerned about everyone else's--not from any altruistic
<br>
sense, but from a practical one. If we're to take, or reclaim, or assert, or
<br>
manufacture this freedom for ourselves, there is great danger in at least not
<br>
offering it to everyone. (Anyone, of course, has the right to refuse it.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Death is death is death. Natural selection is all well and good, it's gotten
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the point that you are wanting to make is that natural selection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more efficient than the alternative, whatever that may be. I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's necessarily so. The idea of becoming transhuman is that we can shape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves as we see fit, and as is best to meet the challenges of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. We can use many tools to do this, simulated natural selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amongst them. Plain vanilla natural selection (ie: kill lots of intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings, repeat) is an extremely slow way to improve our fitness in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe. It would be ludicrous to suppose, for example, that you could put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a population of practically immortal transhumans next to a population of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally evolving humans, and expect the &quot;natural&quot; humans to compete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution is fine, fabulous. Natural selection is clumsy, slow, tyranical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and incredibly inefficient. Take it down from the pedestal.
</em><br>
<p>Well put! It's long been my contention that where natural selection ends,
<br>
artifical selection begins (this is an oversimplification). Intelligent agents
<br>
(ourselves, for instance) then become responsible for their own evolution, and
<br>
for the evolution of intelligence in general, using whatever tools they are
<br>
capable of making. Since we humans have evolved through natural selection to
<br>
the point where we can do this, I don't see how it could be anything but
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; for us to do so. If we were to continue to rely only on &quot;plain
<br>
vanilla natural selection&quot; (as if we could, now), we'd pretty much be headed
<br>
for stagnation or extinction.
<br>
<p>A similar perspective is presented much more eloquently in the last chapter of
<br>
Wyn Wachhorst's The Dream of Spaceflight: Essays on the Near Edge of Infinity,
<br>
a book I would highly recommend. His writing is sort of a cross between Carl
<br>
Sagan and Loren Eiseley.
