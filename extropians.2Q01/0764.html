In response to my comment about the basement universe having no &quot;purpose&quot;,

<p><em>&gt; How would you characterize the individuals in The Matrix who were trapped

</em><br>
<p>Well, we &quot;think&quot; they do, by the end of the movie I wasn't so
<br>
sure exactly *what* was the real reality was.
<br>
<p>Adopting your frame of reference, then yes, the consciousness these
<br>
people have is running on the &quot;basement&quot; level hardware which is
<br>
the most efficient produced by &quot;natural&quot; evolution so far as we know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; while their consciousness interacts in virtual reality.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  This is in fact a more efficient implementation because
<br>
since they aren't running around in the real world they don't
<br>
expend the excess energy required for that.  Nice efficient hives
<br>
designed to require minimal heating &amp; cooling, etc.  Much more
<br>
efficient than what we have now.  A much larger population could
<br>
probably be supported using the same resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are unaware of their true nature and their existence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially purposeless.  It seems like this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy your definition of saying that these people are not &quot;real&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I misspoke or you may have misinterpreted my statements.
<br>
If its &quot;purposeless&quot; then it *is* real.  If it was created by someone
<br>
for a purpose then you have only been &quot;loaned&quot; the basement level
<br>
matter and energy and it is subject to recall at any point.
<br>
<p>I would say that our world today and the Matrix virtual world
<br>
are equally purposeless, the Matrix world more efficiently so.
<br>
<p>Now, to the degree that we are headed in the direction that we will
<br>
eventually get our hands on the controls of our own self-evolution
<br>
and can begin to really drive our car, we have &quot;purpose&quot;.  (Certainly
<br>
others would define other aspects of their lives as having &quot;purpose&quot;.
<br>
I don't consider mere survival to really be a &quot;purpose&quot;, though many
<br>
might.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet we can stand there and look at them in their pods.  Does it make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to say that these physical people, lying there and thinking in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; front of us, are not real?
</em><br>
<p>They are &quot;real&quot; and in the sense that the VR they inhabit is
<br>
taking up a fair amount of compuntronium and energy, which is
<br>
&quot;real&quot; too.  But the question becomes who constructed that reality
<br>
and put them all there?  (I don't remember if this was in the film).
<br>
Did they do it to themselves?  [I can see humans doing this if the
<br>
were in a resource short environment and couldn't manage to get
<br>
the population under control.]  Or did aliens land on the planet
<br>
and do it to the humans so  they could run off with the remainder
<br>
of the resources?  Or was it done as a benevolent gesture to keep
<br>
people from actually harming and potentially killing themselves?
<br>
(This is the baisis for &quot;The Eden Cycle&quot; I think.)
<br>
<p>Raises some interesting questions -- should we mandate putting
<br>
people in the pods to protect them from the hazards of the
<br>
&quot;real&quot; universe but allow themselves to cause their virtual selves
<br>
all kinds of pain and suffering?  Will people willingly submit
<br>
themselves to this kind of reality because a nano-engineered
<br>
world will simply be too dull and boring?  etc.
