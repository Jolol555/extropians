<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid rate of postmenopausal bone loss is mediated by the
<br>
inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis
<br>
factor alpha. Dietary supplementation with fish oil, flaxseeds, and flaxseed
<br>
oil in animals and healthy humans significantly reduces cytokine production
<br>
while concomitantly increasing calcium absorption, bone calcium, and bone
<br>
density. Possibilities may exist for the therapeutic use of the omega-3
<br>
fatty acids, as supplements or in the diet, to blunt the increase of the
<br>
inflammatory bone resorbing cytokines produced in the early postmenopausal
<br>
years, in order to slow the rapid rate of postmenopausal bone loss. Evidence
<br>
also points to the possible benefit of gamma-linolenic acid in preserving
<br>
bone density.

<p><p>The effect of different n-6/n-3 essential fatty acid ratios on calcium
<br>
balance and bone in rats.

<br>
<p>Prostaglandins (PGs) are known to have various effects on bone metabolism.
<br>
The supplementation of essential fatty acids (EFAs), the precursors of PGs,
<br>
leads to increased intestinal calcium absorption and calcium balance. It is,
<br>
however, not known whether increased calcium absorption and calcium balance
<br>
will enhance the calcium content in bone. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 40)
<br>
aged 5-12 weeks were supplemented with EFAs. The main dietary EFAs, linoleic
<br>
acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) were administered in a ratio of 3:1
<br>
as a control group. The conversion of LA to ALA to the PG precursors is
<br>
slow, with the first step, delta-6-desaturation being rate limiting. Fatty
<br>
acids beyond this rate-limiting step, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, n-6) and
<br>
eicoapentaenioc acid (EPA, n-3), were administered to different groups in
<br>
the ratios 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3 to explore the impact of different ratios of n-6
<br>
and n-3 EFAs. Intestinal calcium absorption (mg/24 h) increased by 41.5% in
<br>
the 3:1 supplemented group, compared with the control group. The decrease in
<br>
urinary calcium (mg/24 h) correlated with the increase in n-3 level. The
<br>
calcium balance (mg/24 h) and bone calcium (mg/g bone ash) increased
<br>
significantly in the 3:1 (41.5% and 24.7%) group, compared with the control.
<br>
The increase in bone calcium might be attributed to an EFA-induced increase
<br>
in circulating PGs. An increased synthesis of PGs acting on target bone
<br>
cells, as well as changes in membrane fluidity, may underlie these
<br>
observations.

<p><p>Serum fatty acid imbalance in bone loss: example with periodontal disease.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Among the numerous factors of bone remodelling, the local action of
<br>
arachidonic acid metabolites together with cytokines, is particularly
<br>
important, especially that of prostaglandin PGE2. It has been suggested that
<br>
the alveolar bone destruction in periodontal disease and osteoporosis can be
<br>
treated by reducing the ratio of arachidonic acid in phospholipids, which
<br>
would diminish prostaglandin production. The aim of this study was to
<br>
evaluate the main serum polyunsaturated fatty acids and a possible
<br>
alteration in the level of arachidonic acid in patients suffering from
<br>
periodontal bone loss. Of the 105 patients who participated the study, 78
<br>
were suffering from periodontal bone loss and 27 served as a control group.
<br>
The fatty acids were measured in serum by gas-chromatography. The results
<br>
showed that the level of fatty acids of the n-6 pathway was higher in our
<br>
patients with bone loss than in the control group, whereas the reverse was
<br>
observed with fatty acids of the n-3 pathway. In conclusion, our patients'
<br>
bone losses are linked with an imbalance between n-6 and n-3 fatty acids,
<br>
which seems to justify a diet increase in 20- and 22-carbon fatty acids.
