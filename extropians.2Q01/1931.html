</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the excess so many paranoid people had stashed in mattresses, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of which did make it into the stock market.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, browsing through
<br>
<a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/eibrowse/broecind.html">http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/eibrowse/broecind.html</a> does not support
<br>
your statement.  The interest rate increases came much later, February,
<br>
March, and after and were tiny.  This after cutting rates in 1999.  While I
<br>
don't think Roberts is totally correct, he might be on to something here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Had we been on some alternative system, say a Gold standard,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example, there would have been zero flexibility in the system to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accommodate all the paranoid hoards putting cash in their mattresses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We truly would haver seen a huge crash in the market during the years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before Y2K.  Not just a recession, but likely a real depression with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible very long term slow down effects.
</em><br>
<p>The alternatives to the Federal Reserve System (FRS) are not all just like a
<br>
100% reserve gold standard advocated by von Mises and Murray Rothbard.  In
<br>
fact, a free market fractional reserve banking seems seem to have been a lot
<br>
more flexible than the FRS -- at least in those places for which we have
<br>
reliable data.  Under such a system, each bank would set its own interest
<br>
rate and reserve requirements as well as decide asset portfolios and other
<br>
such rules.  (See <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/~var/free-banking/index.html">http://www.shef.ac.uk/~var/free-banking/index.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;for more information and links on free banking.)
<br>
<p>Remember, also, the Great Depression happened under the FRS!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead of a huge market swing in the negative direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before Y2K, we saw an upswing.  Then after the Fed soaks up all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excess liquidity (most of which was required to accommodate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hoarders) during Y2K, things return to normal reality.  I don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why everyone is complaining so much.  Not only is there not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depression, we've really just barely crossed the line and it's hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to even claim we are in a real recession.  Growth has simply slowed so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can all take a breath after the exciting times that was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transition into the 3rd millennium.  Thank you Alan Greenspan!
</em><br>
<p>It's hard to say.  I think if the Fed had not cut rates in 1999 and also
<br>
tinkered less in earlier years -- the LTCM and much earlier Mexican bailouts
<br>
come to mind -- the US economy might be in much better shape.  The
<br>
artificial boom of late 1999/early 2000 would not have happened.
<br>
<p>Also, inflation, as I've mentioned in earlier posts (in March) is a hard
<br>
thing to measure precisely, specifically in terms of the damage it does.
<br>
(See &quot;The Costs of Inflation Revisited&quot; by Stephen Horwitz at
<br>
<a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/wpmain.htm">http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/wpmain.htm</a> and his book _Microfoundations
<br>
and Macroeconomics_.  He also devotes space in his book on discussing
<br>
alternative banking systems, including government central banking (like the
<br>
FRS and Bank of England), 100% gold reserve banking, the BFH system, and, of
<br>
course, free banking.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It only seems bad in comparison to the clearly unsustainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100% annual growth rates we experienced during the last few years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll take a few years of unbelievable growth followed by a mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowdown any day over a depression and the long term consequences to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth such would surely have.
</em><br>
<p>Hard to measure the full effects of all that wasted effort.  Measures like
<br>
employment rates are not good or aggregate capital, since capital is not a
<br>
amorphous blob that you just add to.  Certain lines of investment forcelose
<br>
others, distorting the structure of capital.  These are the costs of bad
<br>
investments and are not reversible by merely undoing the inflation.
<br>
<p>Also, if such growth rates were &quot;clearly unsustainable,&quot; then why didn't the
<br>
Fed with its army of statisticians and economists see this and prevent the
<br>
slowdown?  I'm not saying this was possible, but that kind of cuts in favor
<br>
of free banking.  Free market banks would see immediate losses (in reserves
<br>
or profits) for failures to act or bad actions.  This would be a quick and
<br>
easy measure of whether their policies were working or not.  plus, the
<br>
information would be local and easy to monitor.  Individual banks would have
<br>
the data!  The Fed does not have this information and has to rely on all
<br>
sorts of data collected and processed after a boom or bust is underway --
<br>
after it's too late to correct a mistake.
<br>
<p>They would have an immediate incentive to correct mistakes.  Why?  It's to
<br>
their profit.  The Fed does not have the same incentive.  Getting it right
<br>
might mean Greenspan gets reappointed and getting it wrong might mean he
<br>
doesn't, but other than that he has little incentive not to screw things up.
<br>
(Granted, he's not been as wreckless as he could be, but that has nothing to
<br>
do with incentives.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There could be no stronger testimony that the system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working and that the current Federal Reserve System is doing good,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely better than any other alternative I've ever heard about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially inflexible rigid unintelligent old fashioned alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like &quot;The Gold Standard&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  It's a false and unrealistic dichotomy to assume either we must
<br>
have the current Fed or some whacky 100% gold reserve system.  I beg you to
<br>
examine the literature on free banking.
<br>
<p>This is important to Extropians and transhumanists because being to develop
<br>
and enjoy technology requires a sustainably growing economy.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
