INVESTORS INTELLIGENCE, started in the 50's, is best known for its BEARISH
<br>
SENTIMENT INDEX, an indicator that measures the sentiment of investment
<br>
newsletters. Started in 1963, it's best used as a Contrarian indicator.
<br>
When too many people think the market will go up, it goes down, and when
<br>
too many people think it will go down, it goes up..
<br>
I.I.'s basic strategy is to look for investments that have been unpopular,
<br>
but are just starting to become popular.
<br>
This is done by looking for stocks whose relative strength has switched
<br>
from negative to positive; where insiders have switched from selling to
<br>
buying; and where Industry Bullish % starts to move up from a low level.
<br>
Fourth in Mutual Fund performance for 10 years to 6/30/97, first on Risk
<br>
adjusted basis.

<br>
As far as useless hypotheses go, investors' intelligence looks more
<br>
hypothetical than plainly useless. If investors could precisely predict
<br>
market fluctuations, they would no longer fluctuate (due to dampening
<br>
effect of accurate prediction). If we exactly determine volume, we can't
<br>
know the markets' final trajectory; and if we ascertain its direction, we
<br>
lose sight of its real volatility. Consequently, investors' AI expert
<br>
systems base predictions on insider information and covert knowledge,
<br>
rather than on trends or facts available to the general public. Market
<br>
prediction becomes accurate in direct proportion as it becomes
<br>
manipulated. Ever has it operated thus.
<br>
Tip: Invest in Redding, California real estate... plenty of electricity,
<br>
clean air and water, and all kinds of recreation.
