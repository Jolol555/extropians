</em><br>
<p>This idea has been a favorite of mine since I first read about it in
<br>
Scientific American in August(I think) 1965.
<br>
<p>At the end of his excellent paper, Elektron: Electrical Systems in
<br>
Retrospect and Prospect, Jesse Ausubel gives a short discussion of maglev
<br>
tunnel-train transport.
<br>
<p>this paper can be found at
<br>
<p><a href="http://phe.rockefeller.edu/Daedalus/Elektron">http://phe.rockefeller.edu/Daedalus/Elektron</a>
<br>
<p>An extensive list of Ausubel's publications can be found at
<br>
<p><a href="http://phe.rockefeller.edu/biblio.html#energy">http://phe.rockefeller.edu/biblio.html#energy</a>
<br>
<p>When I went there to find the above links so that I could include them
<br>
here, I found that Ausubel and Ceasare Marchetti have recently published a
<br>
new article,
<br>
<p>The Evolution of Transport, in The Industrial Physicist 7(2):20-24,
<br>
April/May 2001, 
<br>
which can be found full text in PDF at

<br>
<p>I have only just downloaded this file and have not yet read it.
<br>
<p>Regarding your questions, Samantha:
<br>
<p>In truth, I don't see obstacles in the environmental issues.  On the
<br>
contrary, as this transport system is clean/electrical, efficient, and
<br>
underground, all environmental impacts are beneficial compared to current
<br>
transport methods.  (Of course, one has to generate the electricity.)
<br>
<p>The major issue has to be cost.  The ***HUGE*** capital cost of building
<br>
hundreds/thousands of miles of tunnels with integral electrical
<br>
distribution system.  These costs are, of course, based on current
<br>
construction methods, which one would expect to decrease with the march of
<br>
progress, particularly advances in automation.
<br>
<p>The other, smaller IMO, obstacles are lack of vision and political will.
<br>
Because no such system currently exists to demonstrate its feasibility and
<br>
value, the support for it is almost non-existant.  No vision.  Particulary
<br>
absent vision-wise is the social/infrastructure value of an ultra- fast,
<br>
safe, clean, and efficient medium and long range national transportation
<br>
system.  Opponents will cry  &quot;Pork!&quot; &quot;We've already got a national network
<br>
of trains and planes.  We don't need to spend trillions of dollars on
<br>
another one.&quot;
<br>
<p>And while it's much more useful than an international space station, a
<br>
dubiously functional anti-missile shield, or the new A-22 military
<br>
industrial super pork luau, a project the size of underground tube
<br>
transport requires government support, and that requires a constituency,
<br>
which I don't think exists at this time.  Now such a constituency could be
<br>
built, the vast sums of money involved guarantee that, but between the
<br>
futurist novelty, the vast cost, and the resistance of established rail and
<br>
air transport 'interests',  I would expect at best an agonizingly gradual
<br>
process, starting with studies, then a demonstration project, and then a
<br>
real, but small, system in a very high density transportation
<br>
corridor--Boston to Washington.
<br>
<p>Then again, perhaps you could bootstrap the process with a little bit of
<br>
creative dual use cost cutting.  Say, an undergound transport-slash-prison
<br>
system.  Put all prisoners in the tunnels with the drilling machines.  Have
<br>
the motto be &quot;Tunnel your way to freedom&quot; or &quot;Less locks with Morlocks&quot;, or
<br>
some such.
<br>

<br>
