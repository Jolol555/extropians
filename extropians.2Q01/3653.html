<p><em>&gt;&gt;In Volume 98, Numbers 3-4 of the the International Journal of Neuroscience,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Dr. Miles Storfer, The Foundation for Brain Research, Delray Beach, FL. USA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;proposes that the prenatal development of human intelligence can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;influenced by our parents' postnatal environment - not by altering the DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;sequences of our protein-coding genes, but by changing the &quot;developmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;blueprint for gene expression&quot; that unfolds in the womb (to wit, changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the timing and extent of gene expression in environmentally-stressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;portions of the developing neocortex).  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is this guy a flake or a genius?  I just talked to William Dickens, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wasn't impressed, but I was wondering: would our local experts in biology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and/or neurology might pass judgement?  He seemed to me to have an impressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;command of a wide range of relevant evidence, but them I'm no expert the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;topics he discusses.
</em><br>
<p>The writer is very bright but, at least on this topic, writes as if he's 
<br>
nuts.  The idea that parents manipulate is plausible and does happen; but 
<br>
it's not common and I would expect strong data to support it over more 
<br>
straightforward explanations of parental effects like well-fed mothers can 
<br>
make better babies.  His detailed modeling shows a lack of knowledge about 
<br>
how imprinting and parental effects work and has a lot of grasping at straws. 
<br>
&nbsp;Reading it feels very surreal as he's obviously done his homework on the 
<br>
terminology and literature and then misses some real basics, or makes very 
<br>
biased presentations.  
<br>
<p>Mothers do manipulate progeny pre-natally.  An ape example is gorillas; 
<br>
female gorillas produce male-skewed offspring when in good condition and 
<br>
female-skewed offspring when in bad condition.  However, for the mother to 
<br>
manipulate offspring intelligence would require that the mother ascertain the 
<br>
values and cost of intelligence to her children, that there be some 
<br>
substantial trade-off, and that the trait is simple enough to be manipulated. 
<br>
&nbsp;All this is very iffy.
<br>
<p>The claims for environmental irrelevance in IQ are breathtaking.  He cites 
<br>
the Dutch Hungry Winter of 1944 (a mild famine lasting a few months) as 
<br>
&quot;only&quot; reducing IQ 1.9 points.  Gosh, a hungry childhood would &quot;only&quot; reduce 
<br>
IQ about 90 points, at that rate.  No mention of other work on calorie 
<br>
restriction in very young
<br>
monkeys showing profound mental retardation.
<br>
<p>The myopia/imprinting correlation just consists of citing unexplained 
<br>
variance in poorly controlled or downright anecdotal studies.  E.g. the 
<br>
indian studies where myope children of non-myope parents have 8+ hours of 
<br>
close work per day.  8 hours! That's a child labor subgroup; there will be 
<br>
some major environmental differences with the myopic parent group, both with 
<br>
children and with parents.  He &quot;proves&quot; neuronal complexity causes mental 
<br>
capacity with 3 case studies (and then later says it's cortical size that 
<br>
matters!).  He has this implicit assumption that if children differ when 
<br>
starting school, it must be due to genetics.  ??  
<br>
<p>The claim that fathers must make a stronger genetic contribution because 
<br>
mothers provide more of the environment really doesn't hold any water.  A 
<br>
correlation between mother and child intelligence due to that would be equal 
<br>
to the correlation of mother's IQ with grandmother's conferring ability (20% 
<br>
at most), times the correlation with mother's conferring ability (50% at most 
<br>
and probably much less), times correlation of mother's conferring ability 
<br>
with baby's IQ (20% again) .   That's less than 2%, possibly much less.  
<br>
You'd never see it, even if it's there.  Further, a lot of studies separate 
<br>
out the pre-natal effects so *of course* they
<br>
don't show more input from mom's genes.
<br>
<p>There is *no* requirement for sexual dimorphism for imprinting.  There's an 
<br>
association, because dimorphism in parental care provides opportunity for 
<br>
conflict between parent's genomes about the offspring's demands.  But if the 
<br>
goal is offspring benefit apart from exploiting the other parent then a 
<br>
non-dimorphic species would do it just as well.  Even asexual mothers 
<br>
manipulate offspring freely, as with production of the sexual morph in 
<br>
cyclically parthenogenic Daphnia, or sporulation in [pick a species].  So the 
<br>
&quot;sex differences provides an opportunity for rapid mammalian evolution&quot; is a 
<br>
castle built on air.
<br>
<p>The business of mitochondrial transmission of IQ through the father is 
<br>
bizarre. We've never seen paternal mtDNA in a human, ever; plus the genome is 
<br>
so tiny there's no room to have much going on.  Fathers *do* imprint, but 
<br>
only on nuclear genes, as far as we know.
<br>
<p>Sorry to be crude, but this sounds like the attempts of a high-IQ male myope, 
<br>
possibly Jewish, to justify himself as the ultimate in human evolution to 
<br>
date.  He's bending a lot of science to claim particular groups produce 
<br>
super-sperm, basically, and I'll bet he's a member of those groups.
<br>
<p>If somebody came up with some evidence of imprinting/ parental effects in 
<br>
myopia or IQ, I'd be interested, but this isn't it.  I'm mildly curious about 
<br>
all the myopia variances but it's patently obvious the studies aren't very 
<br>
comparable/well controlled.  IMO it's probably something like whether 
<br>
toddlers get read to.  E.g., desparately poor Indian parents don't read to 
<br>
their children and so the children are only myopic with extended close work.  
<br>
Myopic (and usually middle-class) parents do read to their children so they 
<br>
get a &quot;head start&quot; on myopia.  Additionally, if parents can't afford 
<br>
eyeglasses there are limits to how myopic the children will get.
