</em><br>
<p>If so, then they are inaccessible to the people making the claim &quot;There
<br>
are untestable truths&quot;.  As someone pointed out, none of the Books show
<br>
prophets talking about untestability.  Elijah confronting the priests of
<br>
Baal would have understood perfectly the put-up-or-shut-up attitude of
<br>
modern-day science.  Now this may be because Elijah is a historical
<br>
character with superpowers who thus didn't lack for self-confidence, or it
<br>
may be because he's a fictional character who was invented before the
<br>
defeatism that permeates modern religion.  Either way, the concept of
<br>
untestability and scientific inaccessibility is clearly a modern
<br>
innovation created by a bunch of theologians who, not to put too fine a
<br>
point on it, insisted that the Earth was flat and six thousand years old
<br>
and got their butts kicked (by Truth, not Science) and have been running
<br>
scared ever since.
<br>
<p>So now we have theologians who not only make excuses for past failures,
<br>
but make up further excuses in advance.  Present them with any scenario in
<br>
which their beliefs are tested, and they'll immediately start making up
<br>
excuses in advance for why they'll fail.  The thought that they might
<br>
succeed doesn't even occur to them - defeatism, pure and simple.  I'm sure
<br>
the excuses they're making up in advance conform exactly to the ideals of
<br>
religious faith, but whatever part of their brain is deciding which
<br>
results they'll probably need to make excuses *for* is so perfectly
<br>
atheistic that not even Daniel Dannett could disapprove.
<br>
<p>Modern theology has suffered a total failure of confidence.  The Books
<br>
demonstrate very clearly that religions are supposed to be testable. 
<br>
Humans innately expect people with religious power to predict the future
<br>
and heal the sick.  Modern theologians can't heal diddly, which was fine
<br>
back when nobody else could either, but now that technology has come along
<br>
they're scared sick that somebody's going to notice the difference between
<br>
making big claims and delivering on them.  But that is simply not
<br>
science's problem.  It gets solved either when another prophet comes along
<br>
who can actually heal the sick, or when religion finally folds in and
<br>
admits it was a lie all along.  Either way, theology's failure to live up
<br>
to its own expectations has nothing to do with science.

<p>I am not playing this game.  Every time I say &quot;Well, if we have immortal
<br>
souls, then they'll show up in a nondestructive brain scan&quot;, the other
<br>
person, whose actual Outcome Predictors were coded by rabid atheists, says
<br>
&quot;But what if it *looks* like everything is totally understandable, and the
<br>
upload doesn't notice any difference, and nobody else can tell the
<br>
difference, but the soul is still missing?&quot; and wants to know what I'll do
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p>Draw a line in the sand, theologians!  Pick a place where you stop
<br>
retreating!  Put up or shut up!  Say that the upload will die on the
<br>
spot.  Say that he'll turn into a remorseless killer.  Say that he'll lose
<br>
all his artistic creativity.  Say that we'll find the neurons are doing
<br>
something incomprehensible.  Say that no amount of experimentation will
<br>
ever explain it enough to correctly predict a single neuron.  I can plan
<br>
for the possibility of a religious universe if you'll tell me how it looks
<br>
different from a totally materialist universe, but as long as you go on
<br>
using rabidly atheistic Outcome Predictors, then I'm sorry, but there's
<br>
nothing I can do for you.
