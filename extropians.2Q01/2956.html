</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all, just thirty years ago Singapore was basically a third world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backwater.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Let me know if the above quote contains HTML glop. Supposedly, AOL's 
<br>
wonderboys have fixed it so that it will not copy script-glop. Apologies if 
<br>
it does. I am guessing that there are several reasons why Singapore succeeded 
<br>
where Somalia, seems to remain a backwater.
<br>
<p>1) There is order in Singapore because the peoples that comprise Singapore 
<br>
desire    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.  Somalia hasn't gone up that hierarchy of needs yet. 
<br>
<p>2) There is a respect for learning in Singapore, in Somali-little. It's 
<br>
agrarian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge, at best. Agrarian knowledge in wonderful, but its not software 
<br>
coding.
<br>
<p>3) There is the same unhappy mix of politics and religion, that has slowed 
<br>
many
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;countries.
<br>
<p>4) Somalia is more fractionalized amongst tribes and clans.
<br>
<p>5) The transition of powers between regimes is not clear as it is in 
<br>
Singapore. Note:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Singapore, there is still the authoritarian smell of dictatorship. 
<br>
There is more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that as the economy develops, the hunger for self-representation 
<br>
will occur.
<br>
The capitalist spirit is essential, but its comparative to growing a heart in 
<br>
vitro, and claiming it as a human personality. It's important, but there 
<br>
needs to be more. Is Somalia going down the road of development? I'd need 
<br>
more evidence to be convinced.
