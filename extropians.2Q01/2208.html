<em>&gt;A genetic program for aging?
</em><br>
<p>Forgive me for my computer analytical mind. I tend to see the DNA as a
<br>
computer program. After conception, the software starts to run aiming at
<br>
producing offspring. Aging can be either pre-programmed in the genetic
<br>
program (e.g. salmon) or a result of bugs whose damage accumulates as the
<br>
program runs (e.g. humans). CR mice can take twice as much time to reach
<br>
sexual maturity;  therefore, CR does not only delay aging, it delays the
<br>
entire ontogeny -- i.e. the genetic program -- of an organism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is meant by basic mechanisms?
</em><br>
<p>Some might disagree, but I think that human aging is caused by some
<br>
deleterious process acting continually over time. Good examples are the
<br>
popular theories: free radicals, DNA or telomere damage, mitochondrial
<br>
damage, etc. Generally I call senescence to the basic mechanism of aging, to
<br>
the errors in the genetic program that cause our vulnerability to increase
<br>
with age (this excludes individual age-related diseases such as
<br>
farsighteness, which would develop with or without senescence).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; aging. Finally, caloric restriction in animals (mice and monkeys) leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; diminished body functions which are undesirable for a normal human being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (for instance, diminished physical abilities).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, except mice and rats do *not* show a decreased overall metabolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate (per unit of body mass) under caloric restriction. Nor lessened
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activity. Nor lessened intelligence. The possibility is still open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the metabolic rate of individual organs or tissues is different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under CR, with the whole body metabolic rate not significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altered.
</em><br>
<p>As you probably know, if you increase the caloric intake of mice, they live
<br>
the same. So, total energy consumption does not explain everything. You can
<br>
argue that perhaps CR forces the optimization of energetic pathways.
<br>
Alternatively, it would be fun if lower temperatures in CR animals somehow
<br>
lessen molecular damage. Now, if you had a normal development and a
<br>
decreased rate of aging under CR, I would be excited. Since everything is
<br>
slowed down and animals develop atrophies, at the moment (and I do not
<br>
discard future developments in the field), it tells us very little about
<br>
senescence. And the side-effects of CR remain undesirable: you wrote &quot;Not
<br>
lessened activity&quot; but the animals are smaller and have lower temperatures.
<br>
They can't practice exercise like normal animals! And if you apply this to
<br>
humans, most persons -- e.g. I -- will not accept it.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the references. One question, how do they measure the
<br>
intelligence of mice? I ask this cause it's something I've been thinking
<br>
about (if CR generally leads to less muscles, why not smaller brains too?)
<br>
<p>Best wishes.
