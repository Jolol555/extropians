Normally, I do not forward personal emails, but this is the first time I've
<br>
ever received something I'd classify as hate mail.  Needless to say, since
<br>
the writer does hope for my demise, I felt he or she had put himself or
<br>
herself outside the pale of normal net etiquette.
<br>
<p>I take it he or she is my very juvenile piece &quot;What is posthumanism?&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.subsitu.com/kr/posthum.htm">http://www.subsitu.com/kr/posthum.htm</a>
<br>
<p>BTW, I've been busy of late, which is why I've not continued the dinosaur
<br>
thread...  I'll get back to it later.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>

<p><em>&gt; Daniel, your rampant stupidity and generalizations so bogglingly unfounded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and misled are extremely difficult for anyone who feels the sanctity of
</em><br>
life
<br>
<em>&gt; or sees the fact that nature (dare I use that word to somebody who twists
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; so sickeningly) and evolution obviously has inherent integrity or life
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; have ended billions of years ago. The likes of you, who are disconnected
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; the birth-given beauty of your own body so thoroughly deserve to be
</em><br>
brutually
<br>
<em>&gt; dissected until nothing remains but a brain floating in a plastic on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intravenous feed and an artifical heart. In this horrid condition of
</em><br>
undying
<br>
<em>&gt; deadess you may have the priviledge of being in a greatly simplified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Posthuman&quot; hell. Maybe then in your several decades of absolute torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before death by old age, you would realize the inalieable sacredness of
</em><br>
human
<br>
<em>&gt; bodies as they were meant to be.
