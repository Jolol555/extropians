<em>&gt;Blaming the 'Defective' People
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Many things concern us during an economic downturn: stock prices,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;savings and job security, to name a few. Some historians say we can add one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more to the list: eugenics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Believing the human species could be improved through the control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hereditary factors in mating, eugenicists during the Great Depression 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blamed immigrants, the mentally disabled and incarcerated people for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society's woes -- and advocated the sterilization of people they considered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now that economic times are turning bad again, some wonder whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eugenics movement, in one form or another, may return.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;As a country, we have not outgrown bigotry, nor our regular desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find scapegoats for economic conditions, nor the need to enlist science as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the panacea for social conditions,&quot; said Paul Lombardo, an attorney and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;director at the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eugenics was supposedly based on scientific theories that more recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetic studies have proven false. Lombardo worries that if today's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economic problems get worse, eugenics -- not as it was in the '20s and '30s 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but in another form -- could reappear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He cites the recent California political campaigns, where one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;major themes was to close the borders and enforce immigration restrictions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for Latinos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We do not need to look too far back in time to see ideas embraced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the eugenicists rearing their ugly heads again,&quot; Lombardo said. &quot;If the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economy really dives, my bet is it won't be long before the same kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bigotry that percolated up into political debate in the 1990s comes back 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The first legislative documentation of eugenics was a law passed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indiana in 1907 that allowed the involuntary sterilization of patients in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mental institutions, whom eugenicists called &quot;defective people.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The rationale was, if these people have become wards of the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they're genetically defective ... (it makes) most economic sense to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sterilize and cut off these problems at the source,&quot; Garland Allen, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis, said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By 1913, more than 29 states had laws against interracial marriages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Penalties included fines up to $2,000 and a prison sentence of up to 10 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Papers with titles like &quot;The Deviation of Idiot Boys from Normal Boys
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Bodily Proportion,&quot; and &quot;Do Races Differ in Mental Capacity?&quot; were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;published in the Eugenical News.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In 1927, the Supreme Court in Buck v. Bell upheld a ruling that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;institutions could sterilize people considered &quot;mentally defective&quot; without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their consent. Lombardo is writing a book about the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By 1930, at least 15,000 Americans had been involuntarily sterilized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The number totaled nearly 50,000 before the last eugenics law was taken off 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the books in the 1970s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even in 1927 there were many serious critics of eugenics, Lombardo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said. Still, because those beliefs were supposedly based on science, they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;became part of the law for over 50 years in the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Genetic science was respected at the time because animal and plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetics -- i.e., breeding -- was making great strides. Breeding humans was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the next genetic revolution, some scientists thought. The idea was taken 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seriously enough to feature &quot;best bred&quot; families at state fairs alongside 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the strongest cattle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The eugenic argument, which claimed to be a science, only gave a sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of scientific gloss to a lot of ideas that were floating around in society 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that essentially had some economic basis,&quot; said David Micklos, director of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the DNA Learning Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories in Long Island, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;New York. The Cold Spring lab was a hotbed for eugenics in its heyday, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;housed the first eugenics institute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blaming other races or the mentally disabled for economic problems got
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a de facto stamp of approval from this so-called science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Today, with the completion of the human genome map, genetic science is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;once again being put on a pedestal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The current hype that surrounds genetics will provide plenty of fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for those who wish to push neo-eugenic schemes, whether or not they use the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discredited description of 'eugenics,'&quot; Lombardo said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Allen said that like in the '20s and '30s, increasing numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;researchers today are wrongly blaming criminal and other negative bahavior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;My reading of the evidence is that it's no better to make those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claims today than it was 75 years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;The data is very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstantial.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Steven Seldon, director of the Center for Curriculum Development at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the University of Maryland doesn't think we have to worry about eugenics, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;per se, coming back. However, during an economic downturn, the rich will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have more opportunities to take advantage of research breakthroughs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Other researchers, like Micklos, are less worried about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibilities modern-day eugenics presents in the wake of an economic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;downturn.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I don't think there's an exact coupling between the Great Depression
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and eugenics,&quot; Micklos said. &quot;Most of the politics (of it) were set before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the market crash.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans today are so ethnically blended, Micklos said, that it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be difficult to point the finger at any one group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;It's harder to try to restrict the activities of some group by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethnicity these days,&quot; Micklos said. &quot;Everybody looks at themselves and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;says, 'I'm really mixed up.'&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Others believe that the scientific community would come to the rescue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Scientists are too likely today to speak out against any compulsory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state policy that limits the reproductive rights or freedom of people based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on their alleged abilities,&quot; said Elof Carlson, a professor of biology at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stony Brook State University in New York, and author of The Unfit, a book 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on eugenics in Nazi Germany.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One thing is certain. People in the United States will be increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exasperated if the economy continues to decline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Some of the reason you might worry more is because more people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cranky,&quot; Micklos said. &quot;I'm crankier now than I was.&quot;
</em><br>
