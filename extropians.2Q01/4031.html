<br>
<p><em>&gt;A good point. I agree that Warwick is indeed doing a kind of
</em><br>
performance art. Engineering sometimes makes wonderful erformance
<br>
art, and robotics is of course especially amenable to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But I think Stelarc has created something far more integrated than
</em><br>
Warwick.&lt;
<br>
<p>As an artist, yes.  As a sensationalist, no. Stelarc has designed a
<br>
technique and style which stems from the earlier genre of Actionists and
<br>
resembles much of Vito Acconci's body work but uses different tools. He
<br>
automorphs himself, but purely for the art of his work and not his personal
<br>
life.  Warwick's mutations are not clearly aligned with any one art genre
<br>
but rely on the genre of Performance Art to tie the modifications to his
<br>
body with his desire to be recognized as a cyborg.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Stelarc's art is based in a postmodern
</em><br>
deconstruction/reconstruction of the body and its role, which is quite
<br>
consistent.
<br>
<p>I'll have to ask Stelarc about this statement, I'm not sure he would agree. 
<br>
Postmodern has a unwelcome feeling for us Performance Artists :-)  Stelarc's
<br>
work is of Transhumanist Arts period rather than Postmodern period. 
<br>
(Although most critics prefer to use period that have already occured.)
<br>
<p>(&quot;Dissanayake defines postmodernism as, “ . . . a declaration of the end of
<br>
all isms and movements, of the impossibility of further theory.” (1995, 199)
<br>
“Dennis Fehr . . . describes Postmodernism as a philosophical patchwork that
<br>
covers the postindustrial West . . .   [To Fehr] Postmodernism is about
<br>
connecting, combining, erasing lines, taking down walls.” (Walkup, 1999) 
<br>
Perhaps, postmodern art is the result of, “ . . . a cacophonous pluralism, a
<br>
barrage of media-cussed voices with no commitment to change society. [A time
<br>
when] Genius in art came to mean nothing but the ability to elicit column
<br>
inches and produce striking, flashy artifacts.” (Jeffries, 1998)&quot;)
<br>
<p>The more appropriate idea about Postmodern Art would be the ability to
<br>
produce a body (no pun intended) of art with content rather than being
<br>
concerned with its object.  I rather like this and consider Conceptual Art
<br>
as a powerful medium.  However, I not accustomed to referring to
<br>
Installations or Performance Art as Postmodern.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The robotic and cyborg performances of Warwick does not fit well with his
</em><br>
views on the future of human and robot interactions - one one hand slapstik
<br>
and gadgetry, on the other hand the terminator. It doesn't fit together
<br>
artistically in my opinion.&lt;
<br>
<p>His concept doesn't &quot;work&quot;.  It could be for the reasons you suggest above
<br>
but, simply put, a misuse of machinery for shock factor is weak and
<br>
transparent. Art lacks value when the artist employs a sensationalized
<br>
notion without a paralleling conjecture. Thus, I would not categorize
<br>
Warwick’s art as Transhumanist Arts or even transhuman, but his body, with
<br>
it's augments are indeed transhuman.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;[ The art critic as a science reviewer: &quot;While the logos and technique of
</em><br>
the paper are impeccable, there is a lack of pathos that weakens the
<br>
introduction and discussion section....&lt;
<br>
<p>Very poetic.
