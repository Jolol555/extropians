<p>Perhaps I misread Spike's post, which on first glance seemed to me to be
<br>
advocating reqriting the whole thing in Matlab. However, my point
<br>
stands. Frankly, I don't a damn about an application or programming
<br>
environment being open source. What I, and most other computer users in
<br>
the world care about is making OUR files operable/viewable by as many
<br>
other people as possible. If Spike puts out his spreadsheet in excel
<br>
version 5, which any Joe with a spreadsheet application can run, then it
<br>
is effectively open source.
<br>
<p>If Open Source were such a great be all and end all, you would be able
<br>
to make money with it. Since the chairmen of not just Corel, but Red Hat
<br>
and SuSE have all admitted that you can't make money in open source,
<br>
there is obviously a problem with the concept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; open source. Something that can generally be run on a majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people's PCs because of the ubiquity of a given sort of software is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'practical open source'. Excel spreadsheets are of this category.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Garbage. You either have the source for your application and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practically and legally free to do with it whatever you like, or you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't. Do you have the source for Excel? Has Redmond allowed you to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it away for free, so I can build it on my machine? Excel is practical open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source, my ass.
</em><br>
<p>We are not talking about the application, but the spreadsheet. I'm not
<br>
interested in rewriting Excel, nor, I think, is Spike. We are talking
<br>
about rewriting his spreadsheet, which, considering the ubiquity of
<br>
spreadsheet applications, is for all practical purposes, open source, so
<br>
long as editing the spreadsheet is not protected somehow.
<br>
<p>You are confusing your layers. It is perfectly possible to run an open
<br>
source application in a closed source OS, and run an open source
<br>
program, spreadsheet, script, macro, etc in a closed source application.
