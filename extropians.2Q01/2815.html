below

left-leaning
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I often wonder however, if I had been born in a intellectual Jewish

household
<br>
<em>&gt; in Brooklyn of 1900, instead of a Mormon household in rural Idaho in the

</em><br>
<p>My family was always pro-government and mostly Left-leaning, from being
<br>
California liberals to Marxist sympathizers.  Yet, my political views are
<br>
basically libertarian anarchist with a highly Objectivist base.
<br>
<p>I also know many more people of Leftist backgrounds who became libertarians.
<br>
I tend to think that the Old Left was at least semirational, partly because
<br>
it was mostly atheist.  So that left people following its tenets open to
<br>
other ideas that those on the Right would dismiss outright.  Does this make
<br>
the Left right?  Hardly, though, on the whole, I've met more self-proclaimed
<br>
Leftist who are openminded, thoughtful, and reasonable than self-proclaimed
<br>
Rightists.  This might be a sampling error on my part.  Or maybe it's just
<br>
that the atheism part makes for more antipathy...
<br>
<p>I also vehemently disagree with James J. Hughes' seeming painting of
<br>
libertarian thinking as ignorant and just a fad.  His statement that certain
<br>
people [here?] have &quot;a studied ignorance of inequality and oppression&quot; to
<br>
mean is pure ad hominem.  Everytime I look at my paycheck or get the news, I
<br>
see oppression in action.  I see a lot of government oppression, from
<br>
America to Indonesia.
<br>
<p>Inequality, too, is problematic.  I assume he does not mean the old
<br>
classical liberal notion of equality before the law, but the more modern one
<br>
of equality in outcome.  I contend the only way to maintain equality in
<br>
outcome is through some form of oppression, though I don't want to see
<br>
another flame war.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
