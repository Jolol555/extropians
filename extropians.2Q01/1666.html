</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could 'bioregionalism' be the way out of our environmental crisis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kirkpatrick Sale puts the case for the political philosophy he helped to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IN A few years ago, writing a biography of Christopher Columbus for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quincentenary of his discoveries, I came across a wonderful Spanish term -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; querencia - usually translated as 'love of home'. 
</em><br>
SNIP...
<br>
<em>&gt; But it is useful to look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columbus for a bit, for he is a part of the problem (as well as carrier of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem) for which querencia - and bioregionalism itself - is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, they've rediscovered Nationalism (talk about Looking Backward!!!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EXAMINING THE PROBLEM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columbus never knew a home in all his travels, never experienced a love of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place, much less a deep fellowship with any particular part of land or sea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He was in that sense tragically symbolic of the culture from which he sprang,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the culture he was to implant in the New World. Europe was a society of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restless and rootless people, ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And nowhere more so than in the Americas, especially the part settled by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successive waves of European immigrants, ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today 20 per cent of its population changes residence every year (as against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8 per cent in the UK, for example), where social cohesion is so thin that its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder and incarceration rates are the highest in the world, and the barest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum of civic participation (ie voting) engages less than half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population at best, and then but once every four years, that is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable result of being what historian Samuel Morison has called a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'tenacious but restless race' - never knowing, except in rarest incidences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the comfort of querencia.
</em><br>
<p>Despite the fact that this social decohesion and mobility existed long
<br>
before the contemporary problems of voter apathy and high crime and
<br>
incarceration rates. The 'problems' of our society are strictly a matter
<br>
of our diverse demographics. For example, based on the crime and
<br>
incarceration rates of Australia's aboriginal peoples, relative to their
<br>
numbers, if they existed in Australia in similar ratios as the US's own
<br>
african american minority, Australia would have violence and
<br>
incarceration rates even higher than the US currently has. Britain's
<br>
relatively low murder rates, and its growth this past century in crime
<br>
has gone hand in hand with growth in minority populations. 
<br>
<p>This is not due to a lack of love for place, but a lack of love for a
<br>
social ethic, a common basis of liberty and freedom. Minorities, due to
<br>
the discrimination, prejudice, and past injustices, do not feel a
<br>
similar trust in the institutional social ethic embodied in things like
<br>
our Constitution, our trust inherent in the social contract between
<br>
fellow individual citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely that is why this nation, and the industrialised system it has spawned,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has so little regard for the natural world. We don't live on any one part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the land long enough to know very much about it, and it enters our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness mostly only when we wish to exploit it. In that sense Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today are the true inheritors of the early settlers whom Alexis de
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tocqueville described as 'insensible to the wonders of inanimate nature' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'unable to perceive the mighty forests that surround them till they fall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneath the hatchet'. And for all our efforts here in America to establish a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge park system and protect wilderness areas, our truest character is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revealed in our unabated urbansuburban sprawl, a paving over of three million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acres of US farmland by 1995 and now gobbling up more than twice as much land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as just 15 years ago.
</em><br>
<p>Despite the fact that more of our land is preserved in parkland than
<br>
almost any other nation on earth.... but lets not be confused by the
<br>
facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHAT IS BIOREGIONALISM?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the consequences today of living in a system devoted to the rapidest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploitation of the natural world for the rapidest accumulation of junk,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surely it is not fanciful to feel that some such identification with place as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; querencia implies is a necessary antidote; and the sooner the better. Surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it makes sense to imagine a society divided into territories and communities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where love of place is an inevitable byproduct of a life mindful of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems and patterns experienced daily - however far removed this may seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just now for the gigantic, destructive society around us.
</em><br>
snip...
<br>
<em>&gt; HOW COULD IT WORK?snip...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, an economy guided by what Edward Goldsmith has called the 'laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecodynamics' - principally conservation as the 'basic goal of behaviour' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stability as the optimum norm in nature, but including also economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions based on cooperation rather than competition, and enterprises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governed by regardful selfsufficiency rather than imperialism or globalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would have to be careful about drawing down resources, processing, using,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and recycling them, and it would follow the general rule of nature that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes are circular. The goals would be potlatch distribution rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private accumulation (both within and between communities) and general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apportionment of resources rather than individual ownership.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, now we are seeing them bringing in Socialism under a new name of
<br>
'potlatch distribution'. What do you get when you combine Nationalism
<br>
with Socialism?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given coherent and limited populations, some forms of democracy would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, and even consensus might be a goal, but neither would be necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as long as political arrangements were voluntary and placespecific.
</em><br>
<p>In other words, &quot;We don' need no steenking democracy!&quot; (I seem to recall
<br>
Lenin saying such things, that since the Party represented the will of
<br>
the people, that other parties were counterrevolutionary.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Third, a society following such ecological principles as symbiosis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; division,
</em><br>
<p>Resurrecting social parasitism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the first directing cooperation among groups and communities within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bioregion - between countryside and town, for example - and the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuring that none became too large or overbearing. The optimum population of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community and region would be easy to determine, knowing that the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community could not grow so large as to harm or dislodge any other floral or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faunal community or the air and water shared among them, and groups would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to limit their size or break off and form new settlements if they grew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too big.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, meaning, &quot;We decide where you can live and work, and how many
<br>
kiddies you can have.&quot; Yes, they did that both in the Soviet Union AND
<br>
in Nazi Germany.... everyone gets internal passports and the state
<br>
controls where you can work, where you can build, what you can own, and
<br>
who you can marry....
<br>
<p>Lets call a spade a spade: They are simply Nazis without the
<br>
anti-semitism.
