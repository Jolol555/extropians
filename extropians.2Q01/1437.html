<p>I don't know.  Some things really aren't worth arguing.  I'm
<br>
doubtful the process of converting baseless arguments into
<br>
laws will be as smooth as your account suggests, it's like
<br>
building houses out of imaginary bricks.  We should probably
<br>
err on the side of caution, but caution's a many-sided
<br>
multi-dimensional beast and we could just as easily put too
<br>
much energy into influencing popular opinion as too little.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transhumanists in general need to participate in public
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; might make them a bit boring for the moment, but that is
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It's not an easy job; the unprepared can often do more harm
<br>
than good.  I'm doing everyone here a favour by *not*
<br>
participating in public debate, I no longer have the slightest
<br>
clue of how to communicate with the uninitiated, I just look
<br>
bemused and, when I'm feeling talkative, ridicule them.
<br>
Occasionally I try to win a convert, they nod in agreement as
<br>
I step them through my meticulously thought-out argument and
<br>
then accept the conclusion with the caveat that &quot;oh, well, I
<br>
dunno&quot;.  Nothing changes.  With public debate, I imagine, it's
<br>
the audience members you're trying to win over; the ones who
<br>
haven't really thought about it, sort of agree, and now have
<br>
something concrete to work with (&quot;oh yeah, well I heard this
<br>
guy on the radio the other day and he sez...&quot;).  This is all
<br>
very difficult when faced with a debate opponent who doesn't
<br>
quite share our respect for rationalism.  However, I do
<br>
appreciate the efforts of those of you who are out there
<br>
spreading the word, I just (naively) wish that it wasn't
<br>
necessary.  Our opponents, for all their hand waving, offer
<br>
the world nothing.
