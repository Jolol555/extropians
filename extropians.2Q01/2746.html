<em>&gt;&gt; It's a fact that early extropians tended very much

<p><em>&gt; You see anti-capitalists as a significant presence? Hmmm. How are you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defining this? As someone who has only been on the list for about four 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Three people have posted anti-capitalist memes recently,
<br>
and I once read somewhere that three is a crowd. As for
<br>
tolerance, I consider anything short of banning or flaming,
<br>
as quite tolerant.  As for critical thinking, it sometimes
<br>
compels one (on certain subjects) to be rather dismissive---
<br>
life is still short, after all.

<p><em>&gt; People who asserted views against freedom of personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership appeared on the Extropians mailing list late 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - only in the last few years in fact. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many, who previously called themselves Communists or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialists, have started calling themselves Anarchists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the fall of Communism.
</em><br>
<p>How strange.  Why do they not call themselves Progressives? 
<br>
<p>Thanks for the data points, guys.
