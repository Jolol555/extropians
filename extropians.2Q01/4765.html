<p><em>&gt; There's enough computing power on the Internet right now - or, as Eugene 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leitl and Christine Peterson prefer to call it, &quot;poorly defended&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing power - for transhumanity.
</em><br>
<p>If a human runs at 10^16+ ops and the net is ~10^9 (ops) x 10^10 machines
<br>
you have to argue that 1 in 1000 machines are (a) connected to the net
<br>
(not! most are behind firewalls) and (b) are vulnerable.  I've been
<br>
bitten once and subsequently several of my machines went behind the lines.
<br>
So they exist but I doubt you can get to them.  If I'm typical you can't
<br>
claim the net is &quot;poorly defended&quot; (and I focus much less attention on
<br>
security than most corporations).
<br>
<p>Even if the net is equal to 1 human equivalent -- that doesn't let you
<br>
evolve rapidly because humans don't have any idea how to comprehend
<br>
themselves currently or self-evolve.  You don't have the excess capacity
<br>
to make copies and prune the non-successful variants.  You can argue
<br>
that we may get there at some point in the future but I would object
<br>
to the statement that &quot;we are there now&quot;.  (So we are in &quot;slow&quot; evolution
<br>
mode now even from the most optimistic perspectives.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can get a custom DNA sequence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synthesized and an arbitrary DNA sequence turned into protein, so if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can crack protein folding you can get drextech, in, oh, call it three or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four days with FedEx, or one or two days if you assume that the newborn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can spend millions of dollars without tipping anyone off.
</em><br>
<p>Aha, precisely the point -- you have to have something smart enough to
<br>
play &quot;who wants to be a millionaire&quot; without giving itself away.  Its
<br>
doubtful that we are there yet so at best they self-evolve only very
<br>
slowly and have to save their pennies before you can transform that
<br>
into something real.
