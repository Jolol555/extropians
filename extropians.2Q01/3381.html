</em><br>
<p>There is a great difference between no certainty and no difference (I
<br>
think the later was what was regarded as loathable). Just because we
<br>
cannot say a value is wrong in some objective sense, we can look at the
<br>
(objective) consequences of it and see what they are. Some values are
<br>
self-defeating and some result in events that are against the rather
<br>
deep seated values we have &quot;built in&quot; due to evolution (such as survival
<br>
or striving for happiness) - not to mention compared to whatever value
<br>
scales we might set up in the discussion. This may still not prove that
<br>
value A is universally better than B, but it enables a discussion based
<br>
on whatever values the participans happen to share (like that surviving
<br>
and being happy is good).
<br>
<p>My own libertarian views are largely based on this problem: if we cannot
<br>
be totally certain about the validity of other views, the safest
<br>
approach is to allow people to live according to their views as long as
<br>
they do not interfere unduly with me. From this a framework can be
<br>
constructed game-theoretically to minimize conflicts, and so on. 
<br>
<p>On a related note, I have always wondered how the postmodern approach
<br>
deals with loathable ideologies like nazism. From postmodern point of
<br>
view they are all just as valid as say humanism, after all? So what does
<br>
a postmodernist do when confronted with a nazi ideologue? Deconstructing
<br>
him does not help much beyond the rhetoric of digging up some juicy
<br>
influences he might dislike. Showing that the ideology is self-defeating
<br>
in some way is usually a rather weak attack on such an irrationalist
<br>
view. I have the impression that quite a few of the french postmodern
<br>
luminaries instead default to marxism when denouncing LePen and nazis,
<br>
which is after all a cop-out (and in itself worth deconstructing). 
<br>
<p><p><p>[ And for the sake of comparision with the originating theme of this
<br>
thread, my parents were both quite socialist when I grew up. They even
<br>
gave me the _Quotations of Chairman Mao_ to read when I was little. Of
<br>
course, in the 70's in Sweden everything was red - childrens' programs
<br>
on TV about life in oppressed third world nations, doll theatre and
<br>
cartoons with capitalist villains, even music played in kindergarten
<br>
with overt socialist themes :-) I think I just uncritically absorbed it
<br>
all, regarding myself as apolitical. 
<br>
<p>I instead became much more interested in the sciences and science
<br>
fiction. I actually don't think the science fiction influenced me much
<br>
politically, I read everything from Heinlein to very socialist Russian
<br>
authors, other than possibly making me a bit of a Clarkian technocrat in
<br>
my teens. 
<br>
<p>It was actually the debate on this list and with some of my
<br>
transhumanist friends that made me first abandon technocracy and then
<br>
gradually become a libertarian. It was not much the libertarian
<br>
arguments themselves that affected me, but rather that I for the first
<br>
time encountered a forum where politics was debated, where views were
<br>
not just taken for granted. That was tremendously stimulating, and led
<br>
me to start investigating my own views. ]
