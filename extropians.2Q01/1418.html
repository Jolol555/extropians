</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>Sure, Fig 4B has a 4000 K Blackbody curve running across the top
<br>
(very smooth).  The x-axis goes from 0.5 to 1 microns and the Y-axis
<br>
is normalized log Flux_lambda  WD2356-209 lies just underneath that
<br>
BB curve with a flux variation of log -15 to -16.  The wierd part
<br>
is that it dips from 0.5-0.6 microns, rises back up to peak at 0.7
<br>
microns then starts trailing off again (kind of mimicing the BB
<br>
curve) out to 1 micron.  The &quot;noise&quot; on the curve looks similar
<br>
to their other real white dwarf stars.  (They do in the article
<br>
mention though something that makes me think you should treat
<br>
the noise as 'significant' (though 0.1-0.5 noise 'spikes' I
<br>
would consider significant).
<br>
<p>LHS 1402 on the other hand trails off from -16 to -17.2 from 0.5 to
<br>
1 microns, but much faster than the BB curve.  Its very very smooth
<br>
with only a little noise from 0.9-1 microns.  It looks much smoother
<br>
than the other white dwarf curves.
<br>
<p>Commenting on your other note -- it isn't clear what you are going
<br>
to see is a 'dusty' star (there are differences in the curves of
<br>
'dusty' stars v.s satellite enshrouded stars because there is some
<br>
variation in the BB curve in depending on whether the particles
<br>
radiating are larger or smaller than the wavelengths being radiated.
<br>
I don't fully understand this, but it is Kardashev who has said
<br>
it so I believe it.)
<br>
<p>How long you see MBrains under construction depends in large part
<br>
on the value of 'present' thought vs. 'future' thought and the
<br>
quantity of material you have available to work with.  If you want
<br>
to 'fully' develop a system, it may take hundreds or even thousands
<br>
of years.  So as we begin to watch billions of stars the likelyhood
<br>
that among them will be an MBrain under construction goes up.
<br>
<p>The concept that the expansion envelope is past us assumes a host
<br>
of things, not the least of which are:
<br>
a) That remote colonization is in some way valuable.
<br>
b) That the expansion would occur at some reasonable fraction of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed of light.
<br>
c) That one wants to develop 'stars'.
<br>
<p>As I've stated before, I think these assumptions have problems.
<br>
I'll be writing up a more complete paper on this soon for people
<br>
to throw stones at, so lets not get into another debate over it
<br>
at this point.
<br>
<p>The expansion envelope could well be past us and we could still
<br>
see stars if it is much better to develop brown dwarfs.  From
<br>
the looks of things there are a lot more of those out there
<br>
than there are stars.
