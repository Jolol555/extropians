Like Hal, I've long thought that the one might well craft a religion 
<br>
reasonably consistent with Extropian tenets and well designed to plug the 
<br>
memetic receptor site for theological belief systems by appealling to the 
<br>
notion that we exist in a simulation.  But I think such a religion (or, as I 
<br>
would term it, &quot;reliberion&quot;) ought to spell out more clearly the hows and 
<br>
whys of Rapture.  Here's one quick take on the matter: The entities running 
<br>
our simulation do so not merely for entertainment but, more importantly, for 
<br>
reproduction.  As they quite naturally exist themselves in computational 
<br>
space, they generate new entities via computational means.  And just as we 
<br>
generate our children by the same means that our parents begat us, so too the 
<br>
god (or gods) hosting our simulation rely on the rough-and-tumble of 
<br>
self-interested agents (albeit simulated ones) to give birth to new gods.  
<br>
Our simulation thus functions something like a petri dish, and we sperm and 
<br>
eggs striving to transcend it.
<br>
<p>One practicing the reliberion I'm describing would thus take as his or her 
<br>
goal growing into and thus joining the god(s) hosting the simulation we, ex 
<br>
hypothesi, now live in.  Note that this by no means ratifies prayer, 
<br>
self-abasement, or other such humbug.  Nor does it necessarily imply outright 
<br>
rejection of all rituals.  One would test such practices for their efficacy 
<br>
in promoting the goal of achieving godhood.  (As a side benefit, it bears 
<br>
noting, such a reliberion, even if at best harmless, might help to block 
<br>
infection by more virulent strains of theology.)
