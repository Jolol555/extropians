Crikey, I go to sleep for 7 hours and look what happens....
<br>
<p>Genetically altered humans produced;
<br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1312000/1312708.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1312000/1312708.stm</a>
<br>
<p>Scientists have confirmed that the first genetically altered humans have 
<br>
been born and are healthy.
<br>
....
<br>
Genetic fingerprint tests on two one-year-old children confirm that they 
<br>
contain a small quantity of additional genes not inherited from either parent.
<br>
<p>And also;
<br>
<p>'Tractor beam' technology advances;
<br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1310000/1310771.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1310000/1310771.stm</a>
<br>
<p>A &quot;tractor beam&quot; that can reach out, trap and move objects has been 
<br>
developed by British scientists.
<br>
....
<br>
Scientists believe it will be an invaluable tool for manipulating parts of 
<br>
living cells or components of micro-machines.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>The fact that these children are healthy is a big blow to those who would 
<br>
ban such research based on safety concerns.  While it's probably early days 
<br>
yet in these childrens' lives, it might force a rethink among those who've 
<br>
used this excuse as a &quot;comfort zone&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
