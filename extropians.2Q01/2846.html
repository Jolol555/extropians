<p>I guess there are a bunch of aviation experts on this list. Since I have
<br>
zero knowledge of the aerobatics involved, could anyone explain *why* the
<br>
Chinese version is impossible? 
<br>
<p>The analogy that comes to my mind is a clapped out old school bus ambling
<br>
along the high ridge, and this pesky Hell's Angel keeps zooming in and out
<br>
and all about, giving the driver the finger, and finally in a fit of
<br>
annoyance the driver turns the steering wheel a hair, and the biker is
<br>
suddenly in the air and falling, while the much greater momentum of the bus
<br>
keeps it firmly on the road, although dented and maybe with a blown tire.
<br>
<p>Does this make sense? If it does, presumably the only reason for denying
<br>
that it's a possible cause in this case is that *Our Guys have Discipline,
<br>
and would never do such a loutish thing unless ordered to, and anyway
<br>
they're Our Guys*.
