Reliberion's Prince of Darkness (aka Eliezer wrote):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this is a simulation, I don't expect that I have much free will. 
</em><br>
<p>Of course you have free will, what would be the point of a simulation
<br>
if you didn't?  [Now of course, if you are a zombie in the simulation
<br>
in which *I* have the free will, then you don't...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to deprecate the &quot;amoral posthumans simulating whole civilizations&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis - (a) I don't think it's true,
</em><br>
<p>Oh, well, that argument wins in my book!  Let me write that down,
<br>
I'll have to use it more often.  :-;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (b) our civilization currently seems to be on track for either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extermination or Friendliness (neither future allows the amoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation of whole civilizations),
</em><br>
<p>What makes you say that?  We are back to the fundmental problem
<br>
what you can do with sub-SI's.  The Aristoi are a good example
<br>
in which the elite SI's can do pretty much whatever they want
<br>
with sub-SI's.  They generally treat them benevolently because
<br>
that is their self-imposed code, it isn't built into the 'hardware'
<br>
however (and they can reprogram the hardware).
<br>
<p>As was pointed out, you don't need to simulate an entire civilization
<br>
you only need to simulate those parts of it where you want to allow
<br>
degrees of freedom.  As I sit here, I have no indication that Eliezer
<br>
or Spike or Greg or Max even exist.  They simply get created on
<br>
demand by the Blue People when I need to interact with them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and (c) if it is true, there's not much I can do about it. 
</em><br>
<p>Pshawww...  You could do something like what Allen Tough is doing with
<br>
his &quot;Invitation to ETI&quot; (<a href="http://members.aol.com/WelcomeETI/hello.html">http://members.aol.com/WelcomeETI/hello.html</a>).
<br>
<p>While I'm not very optimistic about its probability of success, as
<br>
has been discussed in the SETI community for years, if we &quot;do nothing&quot;
<br>
our chance of success is zero (or nearly zero).
<br>
<p>The question becomes to determine the motivations the SI's have
<br>
in running the simulation and determine what could motivate them
<br>
to end it via &quot;uplifting&quot; us (presumably our desired outcome).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Sysop Citizenship Rules, I expect, disallow simulation of single 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconsenting individuals even as personally experienced virtual realities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - never mind the simulation and extermination of entire civilizations!
</em><br>
<p>How do you even know or enforce what someone else does with their
<br>
computronium?  Its the point I made on nanodot about attempting
<br>
to regulate nanotechnology -- you can't verify it because you
<br>
have to disassemble everything to the atomic level to determine
<br>
there isn't any illegal tech present.  Any rules have to be voluntary
<br>
and any voluntary rules that are universally adopted require that
<br>
each of us have access to the same complete set of logical data
<br>
(and experiences) from which those conclusions are derived.  I'm
<br>
not sure how much data this would be, but it sounds like I have
<br>
to give up the individuality of being &quot;me&quot;, so I can adopt the
<br>
universal data set that creates self-enforced sysop citizenship rules.
<br>
I'm unconvinced currently that I'd be willing to make that transition.
<br>
<p>I'll just take myself as is, go to a nearby brown dwarf and transform
<br>
it into Real-World Simulation Land where carnage, suffering and death
<br>
(virtual of course) rule the day.  It isn't *real* carnage, suffering
<br>
and death, its only *virtual*.  Where is the harm in that?  Yes,
<br>
you can argue that the people in the simulation don't know its
<br>
virtual, but their opinions don't count -- they aren't real either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know (or rather, I recall) that during most of my life I would not have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consented to remaining unknowing in the simulation [snip]
</em><br>
<p>It didn't happen &quot;really&quot;, you were created as-is yesterday with
<br>
the memories that it happened because those memories provide
<br>
the ethical perspective that drives you to be doing the work you
<br>
are now doing.  Since that may produce some good in the future,
<br>
instilling a historical framework that drives the simulation forward
<br>
is a necessary condition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, again, I think this *is* the real world. 
</em><br>
<p>Argue your limitations and they are yours... (R. Bach, Illusions).
<br>
<p>Robert
