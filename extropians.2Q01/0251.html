<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post Singularity, we'll all spend much of our time in a state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blissfully preoccupied Focus (but not all of the time --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will no doubt be a recognition of the need for undirected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play and &quot;timewasting&quot; simply as a source of spontaneous variation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and creativity).
</em><br>
<p>Although you say &quot;no doubt&quot; probably out of lexical habit, scenarios of
<br>
recognizable entertainment seem doubtful to me because the evolutionary
<br>
phase transition (AKA Singularity) necessarily transforms work and play,
<br>
so that we (transitional humans) overstep toil altogether, devote all
<br>
effort to even higher transcendence and more complex evolution, and
<br>
redefine it all as a single transformation process.
<br>
<p>As children, we wonder how it will feel to become adults; and as
<br>
(extropian) adults we understand that becoming gods makes all comparisons
<br>
unintelligible. P. D. Ouspensky reportedly told Philip Wylie that we have
<br>
to &quot;think in other categories&quot; in order to make sense of shattered cosmic
<br>
paradigms... shattered because we can see how naively we had constructed
<br>
them, like borrowed pieces of machinery bolted together in the childish
<br>
hope that they could provide an infinitesimal glimpse of reality as
<br>
understood by hyper-cognitive borganized humans. Then again, we may want
<br>
to become hyper-cognitive borganized humans only because we haven't yet
<br>
reached our full potential as humans who, having come to know enough about
<br>
reality to know that life expands extropically without effort, no longer
<br>
believe in producing progress in eternally recurring infinite
<br>
permutations. Perhaps once we've seen the proverbial &quot;elephant,&quot; we no
<br>
longer want to build better technology to decide whether it's a &quot;tree&quot; or
<br>
a &quot;rope.&quot; As a noted thinker has written, &quot;We ought not try to say that
<br>
which can't be said.&quot; To which I'd add, we ought not try to divine what
<br>
only demigods-gods can know. If we should discover the many worlds of
<br>
reality recur eternally in infinite variety... well, that's nothing new.
<br>
<p>When SI emerges, I have a hunch it will tell us that we already have what
<br>
it takes to understand that life is not a mystery to unravel... It's an
<br>
adventure to relish.
<br>
<p>Who needs movies.
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>&quot;Let an ultra intelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far
<br>
surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since
<br>
the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultra
<br>
intelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then
<br>
unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man
<br>
would be left far behind. Thus the first ultra intelligent machine is the
<br>
last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is
<br>
docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.&quot;
<br>
