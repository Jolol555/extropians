<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;- Killer app 1: Life extension... This application will really pull
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;technology&quot; into mainstream culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You might consider using percentages:  For example, 25% of Australian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population already has had an augmentation to their bodies.  5% now use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; robotic arms or legs; 10% have received pacemakers; %3 percent IUDs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (There are arbitrary, but I think you could get some solid facts which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be persuasive in your introduction to augmentations.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read a book called &quot;Communicating Science&quot; which said that this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually not so important on TV... TV likes vague generalisations +
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passionate delivery. The classic concept is that accuracy and clarity move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an inverse relationship on the box.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm very good with handwaving and broad brush opinions masquerading as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Fact&quot;, so I'll probably steer clear of garish numbers as far as possible. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice one is that 10% of americans are cyborgs when you look at drug feed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implants, pacemakers, articifical joints, articificial skin, etc. It must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true, I read it on the web somewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;who delve into these areas... HRT is a great example. These people will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;label themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; HRT is a different augmentation - a chemical augment to monitor female
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hormones to prevent the onslaught of menopause.  You could suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even the mind is augmented by ingesting certain hormones to regulate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chemistry of our bodies for a more healthy and vital life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HRT is supposed to extend life, though, as a side effect (cool side effect).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drugs may well count as cyber enhancements too... anyone got an opinion on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;- Killer app 2: Net connection
</em><br>
<p>This one may actually seem more important to the audience than life
<br>
extension.  Imagine simply speeding up data absorbtion rates, say by
<br>
figuring out how memory is created and finding a faster way of
<br>
translating data (say, text files or books) into memory.  Got a 100
<br>
page research report or legal brief to wade through?  Plug a fast OCR
<br>
scanner into your skull, wave it over the pages, and learn it all in
<br>
detail as fast as you can turn the paper...and that's one of the more
<br>
primitive (and thus, possibly nearer-term) possibilities.  *That*, I'm
<br>
pretty sure, will make your average viewer sit up and take notice, even
<br>
those who dismiss everything else you say as fanciful.
<br>
<p>This might actually count as a different app: personal intranet.  Even
<br>
if one rejects all external connections out of fear that hackers or
<br>
corporations may abuse them, one can still get much use out of a closed
<br>
system where every machine is responsible to oneself only - though the
<br>
'Net connection would be an improvement.  For instance, in the above, a
<br>
scientist could get through a research paper quickly.  With a
<br>
connection to the online repositories of several major journals, the
<br>
scientist could review all known research worldwide in some new field
<br>
in an afternoon.  For once, legislators might actually be able to
<br>
consider all the impacts of proposed law changes, rather than being
<br>
rushed from bill to bill and having to trust instincts and politics.
<br>
And, of course, cyber-telepathic cell phones don't make sounds when
<br>
their users get a call in the middle of a theater.
<br>
<p>And if you want to delve into the fanciful here: imagine a computer
<br>
mind running alongside one's own, sharing all sensory input,
<br>
remembering what one remembers, recording one's judgements, all present
<br>
for playback on demand.  At first, this might seem to be merely
<br>
&quot;perfect memory&quot;, a trait that some humans have naturally.  But it also
<br>
serves as a backup, such that if one's body fails, the box can be
<br>
transferred to a &quot;blank slate&quot; - say, a clone of oneself, kept mindless
<br>
and unconscious so it does not become an independent human being,
<br>
possibly engineered in an artificial womb for 20-odd years - and, with
<br>
some formatting of the organic brain, one lives again, in a younger
<br>
body (possibly better than the one that one had naturally, at least at
<br>
first).
<br>
<p>Frankly, though, it looks like the mental aspects may be more
<br>
immediately appealing to the audience than the physical aspects, since
<br>
there is not as much public conditioning against mental augments than
<br>
against physical ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, you could introduce the idea of enhancing &quot;beauty in the eye of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beholder&quot; by saying we can tweak our visual recognition patters to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; highlight facial qualities that we like and reduce those that we find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unappealiang.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ugly detector... yes, that would be amusing. Also, it raises some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting questions. Why bother to look after your physical appearance at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, if people will, for the most part, repaint you as they desire in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind's digital eye?
</em><br>
<p>At least in the short term - which the audience can most relate to, and
<br>
some will confuse with the long term despite your best efforts - most
<br>
people won't have said digital eye, or at least apply it to strangers.
<br>
(Lovers, for instance, can make it so their loved one always looks like
<br>
whatever their fantasy of the moment is.)
