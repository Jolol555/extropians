<em>&gt; &gt;  Boredom is an emotion and already we have means

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sometimes with side-effects).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I have friends who take some of these anti-depressants.  I have

</em><br>
<p>When I took the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil) for a year,
<br>
some 20 years ago, I was struck by the similarity of the drug's effect
<br>
on emotional response to the side effect it has of blunting orgasm.
<br>
In both cases, it changes the &quot;spike&quot; into a mild &quot;swell&quot; :-&gt;
<br>
<p>Emotionally, you have the impression of **watching** yourself
<br>
feel things, rather than feeling them directly.
<br>
<p>However, if you had previously been in the circumstance of having
<br>
ordinary social encounters stab you with hot blades of self-hatred,
<br>
you'd welcome the relief (you don't stop feeling them altogether;
<br>
they just don't seem to penetrate very deeply anymore).
<br>
<p>Make no mistake, these drugs **do** work, at a cost (so what else
<br>
is new?).

<br>
<p>P.S. -- I have no experience of the newer fluoxetine/Prozac and
<br>
other SSRIs (fluoxetine was only available in Europe when I
<br>
was taking the imipramine), but from what I've heard, the effects
<br>
are similar.
