<p>You don't toast your avionics, you only toast the s00per s3kr1t kRyPt0 
<br>
and s1g1nT components. And you can do it with flip-switches, in a galvanically 
<br>
separate circuit (lest you fry something, or lose power). With high-threshold 
<br>
igniters. And/or mechanical igniters, which are immune to electrical interference.
<br>
(So if somebody NEMPs you, you're not toast, literally so). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if there's a fire on board, you don't want equipment racks adding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the !fun by exploding around the crew who're trying to control it.
</em><br>
<p>Modern explosives are essentially inert. It's just the detonators which 
<br>
are susceptible to mechanical and thermal stimuli.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, much of the equipment will have been custom-designed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely it'd be possible to wire a couple of rails inside the equipment

<p>One word: &quot;nondeterministic&quot;. Frying equipment with a bow discharge
<br>
is *not a good idea*. 'nuff said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; delicate electronics -- without requiring high explosives inside a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressurised cabin.
</em><br>
<p>Pressurized cabin, that's an argument. However, you can blow out pieces
<br>
of the hull first, and then ignite the self-destruct pyrotechnics. (Please
<br>
observe that them are *thin* sheets of plastique). Notice also that 
<br>
thermite is essentially neutral in relation to pressure, and reliably 
<br>
slags equipment in few 10 s, while being easily containable in sandboxes.
