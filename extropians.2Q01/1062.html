<p>Because the redesign in 1992 took out the open-endedness
<br>
that woulda made the project worthwhile.  Look at it.  In
<br>
its current form theres no way to add stuff later.  Its a
<br>
heart-breaking closed design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Is there some orbital difference between

</em><br>
<p>Nope.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it simply not stable enough?  What gives here?
</em><br>
<p>Well, its not *ideal* because people moving around inside
<br>
would disturb the optics, but the telescopes need not be hard
<br>
mounted.  The problem is with the design of the station.
<br>
The original design that the US congress bought was
<br>
more open ended.  spike
