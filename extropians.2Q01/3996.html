<p>I always suspected I was a freak, thanks for confirming it ;) What I meant
<br>
to say that I don't mind having children, but I don't consider them as my
<br>
proxies. I do not go on living in them in any meaningful way after my
<br>
worldline ends, as the genome does not encode the person, nor do a few
<br>
disparate meme make up a person, not even a fragment of a person. Kids are
<br>
nice, kids are horrible, but they're just kids. No more, no less.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In biological terms, neither the desire to live forever nor the desire
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's human body/mind as a medium)
</em><br>
<p>I do not deny that the DNA is modulating my decisions, but the result is
<br>
the same: we do things because we want them. We can't dump all our
<br>
motivations in a purely rationalizable terms. Whenever one pursues a chain
<br>
of logic, one invariably winds up at some basic unquestionable motivations
<br>
which are not rooted in reason. I believe Aleks was implying that the
<br>
desire to live forever was somehow wanting in comparison to the
<br>
constructive tasks accomplished by having biological or memetic children.
<br>
<p>While I do not deny that these tasks are constructive (in fact I might
<br>
still engage in some of them) they're in no meaningfull way better (in
<br>
absence of a global metric) than the desire to live on, while shifting
<br>
from pure Darwin to a mix of Darwin/Lamarck, and to joing the stellar
<br>
Diaspora. Whatever floats your boat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In psychological terms, I'm curious: does the person who wrote this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually ~have~ children?  There is a real subjective feeling that I
</em><br>
<p>The person in question (who's that? hey, that's me!) does not have
<br>
children. Of course the fact of having a child expresses some latent
<br>
biological programmes, modulating your behaviour. If you know young
<br>
parents, you're surely aware of what I mean. Some of them are even aware
<br>
of what is happening to them, as their attitudes are being rather
<br>
forcefully readjusted. Biology is nothing to be trifled with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; have that my kids carry on some &quot;essence&quot; of myself.  I am sure that I
</em><br>
<p>I do not deny your subjective experience, of course, but this does in no
<br>
way invalidate absence of such subjective experience in my case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; am not the only parent to have this feeling.  And it seems mighty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible that this feeling originates, evolutionarily, from the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a parent's DNA wants the parents to protect his/her children.
</em><br>
<p>That seems like a rather probable assumption to make. It is interesting
<br>
that the shift is so profound that the loss of control itself is perceived
<br>
as a positive thing.
