<em>&gt; &gt; For example, suppose that you're on a game show called &quot;ExtroQuiz&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are three doors:  A, B, and C.  One door has a prize behind it.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pick door C.  The game show host opens up door A, and shows you that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empty.  What is the probability that the prize is behind door B?  Answer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 0%.  Why?  Because the game show host *knows* the standard answer to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; riddle, *knows* that most Extropians will switch to B, and he opens A *if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and only if* the prize is actually behind C.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another way to illustrate why it is best to switch doors after Monte
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opens one is by restating the game thus:  Monte offers you one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three doors, but before you choose, he writes a letter on a card and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places it face down.  This is the letter of a door that he knows has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goat behind it.  He says that after you choose a door, which might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one he wrote, he will reveal the door written on the card.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illustration may help some to understand why its best to switch, assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one prize and two zonks.
</em><br>
<p>In this instance, where Monte's actions are fixed, *and the door he
<br>
reveals is predetermined*, the problem is equivalent to the
<br>
lightning-strike riddle that Lee asked.  The card he turns over may have
<br>
'C' written on it.  In this case, if he reveals 'A', there is no reason to
<br>
switch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer's contention is incorrect methinks.  If you choose C and it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zonk, Monte must open A, for he knows B is the prize.  If you choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; C and it has the prize, Monte can open either A or B, and then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switch and get zonked.  So assuming Mr. Hall wishes to zonk you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he can do so only if you originally chose the prize door, 1/3 chance.
</em><br>
<p>Who says that Monte *must* open a door?  If I choose C and it's a failure,
<br>
Monte can simply not open any doors at all.  He only has a logical
<br>
motivation to open a door, possibly causing a change in my actions, if he
<br>
wants me to switch; he only wants me to switch if C actually has the
<br>
prize.  Of course, if Monte realizes that I know this, and I have
<br>
correctly picked C, he will fake me out by showing me B.  This is why
<br>
Bayesian reasoners should never play zero-sum-games with each other.
