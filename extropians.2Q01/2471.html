<em>&gt;I really have to disagree with the statement that Pinker's piece is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'appeal to emotion'. IMHO the article presents a cogent, well reasoned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument backed up by impeccable scientific credentials.
</em><br>
<p>We've seen some with &quot;impeccable scientific credentials&quot; who would say 
<br>
Transhumanism is a nutty concept, and some who would agree with us 
<br>
wholeheartedly.  Credentials don't improve the credibiltiy all that much, 
<br>
esp. when the argument is not cut-and-dried.  And I'd agree, it is well 
<br>
written and cogent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Please give us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some specific examples of where Pinker appeals to emotion in his argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If anything, your reaction seems to be of the emotive, knee-jerk kind.
</em><br>
<p>How nice, ad hominem.
<br>
<p>The entire article is based on the premise that the &quot;human condition&quot; is 
<br>
unchanging and unchangeable.  It's similar to the problem I've commented on 
<br>
in another thread with the &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;probably unknowable&quot; elements of 
<br>
agnosticism.  In both cases, statements are made that seem to be just 
<br>
pulled out of the air, claiming knowledge of their respective areas which 
<br>
I've seen no good evidence is available.
<br>
<p>In the case of the Pinker article, it's well written, so I don't think he's 
<br>
saying human nature will not change out of ignorance of the progress being 
<br>
made by science in areas he touches on, I think he's making the statement 
<br>
knowing full well the way we're headed, yet seemingly unable to bring 
<br>
himself to see it.  In this, I see an element of denial, and in this I see 
<br>
his emotional infusion into this article.  He really doesn't seem to want 
<br>
humanity to change from what it is right now.  But not wanting something to 
<br>
change is little barrier to what can and may occur at such a long time scale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You don't address any of Pinker's arguments, yet still consider yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entitled to the claim that &quot;*everything* IS up for grabs, long term&quot;. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the absence of any rational justification for saying so, this claim sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to me like empty rhetoric.
</em><br>
<p>I don't *disagree* with many of his arguments, I disagree with what seems 
<br>
to be his conclusion;  That humankind, as it exists now in its' current 
<br>
mental/neurological configuration, will somehow survive the next 1000 years 
<br>
unchanged.  I'm not saying it'll be radically changed, or what form the 
<br>
change will take place.  I'm simply saying that given the levels our 
<br>
technology will likely reach (conceivably) over the next 1000 years that 
<br>
the only constant will not be humanity but change, potentially affecting 
<br>
everything inside and out.
<br>

<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
