<p>Now Robert, you know that the fact that water gives you rocket fuel does not
<br>
logically imply that not having water means not having rocket fuel.  Those
<br>
dry asteroids have plenty of metal oxides that can be taken apart to have
<br>
standard rocket fuel.  Even if you had one that was almost all carbon,
<br>
nanotech would be able to make micro mass drivers or ion drives that would do
<br>
as well.
