</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>To put business interest above what is needed for the transformation of
<br>
humanity and what could well be required for humanity to survive what is
<br>
coming is nothing but EVIL.  Either one is ignorant of the implications
<br>
or one knows them and willingly acts against the knowledge.  There is no
<br>
&quot;pragmatic&quot; middle ground where evil is excused because it is perceived
<br>
as good for their business.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Being a cryptoanarchist *and* transparent society fan, I think what we need
</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; credible alternative to stasism, demonstrate why stasism doesn't work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop new political tools to make the passing of stupid/dangerous laws less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempting.
</em><br>
<p>Hear, hear!  Or more generally push for real freedom across the board
<br>
and the dismantling of the huge machinery of the State.  A positive deep
<br>
vision would also be of tremendous help.
