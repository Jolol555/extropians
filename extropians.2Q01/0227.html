</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<p>I think the distinction here should involve *probability* .. since
<br>
as Damien points out, not all 'truths' are publicly demonstrable.
<br>
What we do NOT want to allow is for highly unlikely religious
<br>
claims for &quot;truth&quot; to be accepted just because of this point that
<br>
no-one, including scientists, can tell what happened for certain.
<br>
<p>But if there is a perfectly good natural theory, I argue this should
<br>
take precedence over any competing supernaturalist theories, since
<br>
the 'laws of nature/ physics' need not be overturned in order to explain
<br>
one or two explanatory gaps if there is an explanation that concurs with
<br>
observations from nature.
<br>
<p>We have to go with the most likely/ probable theory in the absence of
<br>
an absolutely clinching piece of evidence ... and in no cases I am aware
<br>
of is a religious account the most probably true theory.
<br>
<p>Correct me if wrong ...... maybe someone can summon Jesus to
<br>
visible appearance ... or persuade Mohammed to float back down
<br>
from the clouds to proof the 'truth' of religious after-life claims &amp;c.
