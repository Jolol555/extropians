<em>&gt;From my monitoring of the 'anarchist' (marxist) mail lists, it seems
</em><br>
they are going all out to disrupt the Free Trade Area of the Americas
<br>
meeting in Quebec City. Some of them are even being good humored about
<br>
it, as follows:

<p>'FIRST WE TOOK QUEBEC CITY, THEN DRUMMONDVILLE'
<br>
THE TRUE STORY BEHIND THE ANARCHIST INVASION OF QUEBEC CITY
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's taken us years of hard work, but finally, We, the Anarchists of
<br>
the World, members of the 10 million strong GLORIOUS, INTERNATIONAL
<br>
BLACK WEDGE, will see, ANARCHY IN QUEBEC CITY, thanks in no small part
<br>
to the
<br>
cooperation of the State, the CSIS, the RCMP and of course, the
<br>
dedicated journalists at The Montreal Gazette and The Globe and Mail.
<br>
who
<br>
unknowingly helped us succeed in our ingenious, 5 stage SECRET MASTER
<br>
PLAN FOR TOTAL
<br>
WORLD SOCIAL REVOLUTION!
<br>
<p>THE FACTS:
<br>
<p>1 * It's official. We convinced the authorities a long time ago, to hold
<br>
the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City - the city of 500,000 closet
<br>
anarchists and to call this Summit: the FTAA - which really means
<br>
'FANTASTIC TIMES FOR ANARCHIST ACTIVISTS.'
<br>
<p>2 * We arranged for a minor earthquake in Seattle, power black outs in
<br>
California, and a few natural disasters, around the world, to indicate
<br>
that we are not fooling around. We are serious. We can cause major
<br>
disruptions and bad cable TV reception.
<br>
<p>3 * We infiltrated global Secret Police Forces to put the fear of
<br>
ANARCHY in them, to convince them that the threat of Anarchism is very
<br>
real.
<br>
Quote: 
<br>
&quot;The RCMP are certainly worried. The presence of anarchists in Quebec
<br>
is one of the top reasons for the 6,000 police officers, the arsenal of
<br>
plastic bullets and the 3.8 metre-high security fence, nicknamed The
<br>
Wall.&quot; (The Montreal Gazette, Friday April 13th, 2001)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this report, we have learned that an additional 1,200 Canadian
<br>
soldiers and innumerable American military personnel will also be
<br>
present to counter our presence. We arranged that, too.
<br>
<p>4 * We recruited the Quebec premier, BERNARD LANDRY as one of our top
<br>
secret agents and turned his party, the annoying BLOC QUEBECOIS into a
<br>
front for THE ANARCHIST BLAC BLOC.
<br>
<p>5 * We convinced them to build the formidable Wall of Shame. This wall
<br>
will now help us contain, secure,  imprison as you will, all the
<br>
despised
<br>
members of this hemisphere's ruling class to help us execute our plan:
<br>
to turn Quebec City into a truly INDEPENDENT, ANARCHIST COMMUNIST
<br>
PARADISE - the first in the world - a place with no more bosses, no more
<br>
borders,
<br>
no more rulers; a self-managed, totally LIBERATED ZONE, where we will
<br>
SOCIALIZE everything, feed and house everyone and use it as a staging
<br>
ground to help us further our dream:  GLOBAL SOCIAL REVOLUTION!
<br>
<p>HOW WILL WE DO THIS:
<br>
<p>It's simple. While most of our people - local, Qu=E9bec City resident
<br>
ANARCHIST BLACK BLOC card carrying members are securing the enormous,
<br>
FREE ZONE outside the official walled off SECURITY PERIMETER, the rest
<br>
of us
<br>
will focus our forces to immobilize and apprehend the trapped members of
<br>
the despised Ruling Class and their thousands of lackeys and armed body
<br>
guards.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the Authorities are terrified and are trying to play down the
<br>
extent of our operation and our invasion force.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to a recent Globe and Mail report that:
<br>
'Some members of the anti-capitalist convergence, the CLAC, may be
<br>
bringing explosives to Quebec City'    the truth is:
<br>
<p>1. Approximately 3 million members of CLAC have already arrived outside
<br>
Qu=E9bec City, each heavily armed with stink bombs, exploding Cuban
<br>
cigars &amp; Barbara Streisand albums. They are camped out in camouflaged
<br>
RVs in the
<br>
suburbs;
<br>
<p>2.  Among them, 30,000  JAPANESE NINJA ANARCHIST WARRIORS are preparing
<br>
to breach the security fence at dawn. They will clear landing pads for
<br>
several hundred ANARCHIST BLACK CROSS HELICOPTERS carrying 14,000
<br>
BELGIAN
<br>
ANARCHIST pie throwing specialists. Look out Mr Prime Minister!
<br>
<p>3. This manoeuvre will provide cover for the BRAZILIAN ANARCHIST AIR
<br>
FORCE CROP DUSTING JETS, primed to drop 5 tons of ECSTACY - disguised as
<br>
snow
<br>
-
<br>
over the target area;
<br>
<p>4. While the ECSTACY falls, 10 thousand three-headed ANARCHIST ALIENS
<br>
FROM MARS -  disguised as visiting space donut entrepreneurs -  will
<br>
sneak
<br>
past security checkpoints and proceed to vaporize all SUMMIT MEETING
<br>
PLACES,
<br>
including all local MacDonald's, Burger King and Harvey's outlets;
<br>
<p><p>5. At this exact moment, 25,000 SCREAMING AMERICAN ANARCHIST
<br>
KINDERGARTEN
<br>
KIDS will spontaneously pop out of Qu=E9bec City manholes armed with
<br>
VICIOUS PICKACHOO WARRIORS &amp; swarm any undrugged,  SUMMIT SECURITY
<br>
FORCES &amp; drag
<br>
them back into the sewers;
<br>
<p>6. Already,  the entire OFFICIAL SUMMIT TRANSLATION CORPS has been
<br>
infiltrated by ITALIAN ANARCHIST SURREALIST TRANSLATORS preparing to
<br>
INSULT every SUMMIT DELEGATE;
<br>
<p>7. If any delegates survive this, they won't survive the food, since the
<br>
OFFICIAL CATERING STAFF has been infiltrated by ANARCHIST FOOD NOT BOMBS
<br>
CHEFS who plan to lace every dish with laxatives &amp; sprinkle itching
<br>
powder on ALL THE TOILET PAPER;
<br>
<p>8. All the moaning and groaning members of the despised Ruling Class
<br>
will
<br>
then be hog tied together with a huge ANARCHIST BLACK BUNGEE CORD and
<br>
suspended &amp; bounced from the peak of the Chateau Frontenac and forced to
<br>
listen to the songs of long time, bona-fide, anarchist cheerleader mom,
<br>
Celine Dion;
<br>
<p>9. At some point, a giant INFLATED TROJAN CONDOM, will appear over the
<br>
City and parachute a 300,000 strong, trained ANTI-TERRORIST ANARCHIST
<br>
PEACE
<br>
KEEPING FORCE to secure the ground and prevent any dangerous &amp; violent
<br>
BLUE BLOCK CIA, FBI AND RCMP agents from interfering with the FESTIVE,
<br>
ANARCHIST CARNIVAL AGAINST CAPITALISM.
<br>
<p>10. Further support will be provided by the RUSSIAN ANARCHIST BLACK
<br>
SUBMARINE FLEET patrolling the St Lawrence River with ANARCHIST GOOD
<br>
HUMOUR LAUGHING GAS MISSILES.
<br>
<p>11. If the ANARCHISTS  encounter any remaining resistance, ANARCHIST
<br>
STARFLEET COMMAND will be positioned over Quebec with a giant ANTI
<br>
VIAGRA STUN RAY.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Hollywood version of 'The Anarchist Take Over of Quebec City'
<br>
starring
<br>
Ben Afflek and Julia Roberts as two, love-struck members of the Black
<br>
Bloc, is already being filmed on the spot. The story will also appear as
<br>
a new
<br>
Harry Potter novel. Anarcho Christians have promised to re-write it into
<br>
their newest version of the Bible. And finally, a long awaited video
<br>
game of the impending, epic, Anarchist victory will be out shortly. *
