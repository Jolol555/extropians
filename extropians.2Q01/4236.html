</em><br>
<p>Yes.  This is broader than what I meant by &quot;differential equation&quot;.
<br>
Into your definition, it looks to me as if the number theory
<br>
Collatz function (defined on each positive integer)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x =&gt; x/2      (if x is even)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x =&gt; 3x + 1   (if x is odd)
<br>
<p>is also a &quot;differential equation&quot;.  Is it, (in your book)?
<br>
<p>I, on the other hand, had characterized differential equations as
<br>
always expressing infinitesimal constraints, and stated that they
<br>
were useful only in this &quot;arena&quot; (a very poor word choice).
<br>
<p>You then gave a nice list of &quot;examples that coupled partial
<br>
<em>&gt;differential equations can model:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    fluids, clouds, chemical waves, populations, markets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    cerebral cell assemblies, ferromagnetism, the immune system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    avalanches, interstellar medium, shocks, bird flocks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    urban growth, and snow crystals
</em><br>
<p>But isn't it true that, to take populations for example, one 
<br>
proceeds by assuming continuous values, rather than discrete?
<br>
It's not surprizing that this approach can yield a great deal,
<br>
(though some of your examples are new to me).
<br>
<p>You then go on to summarize in a very nice way (and in a way
<br>
that I'm sure I don't fully appreciate) some interesting results
<br>
concerning nonlinear dissipative systems and so forth, that I
<br>
don't quite understand the relevance of in this discussion you
<br>
and I are having.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;From a computational perspective, the myriads of intermediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;results necessary in the numerical solution of differential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;equations are merely approximations to the mathematical truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One can always choose the time at which to compute the functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution, so I still don't follow why you are emphasizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;intermediate results&quot;. One can study the system to determine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phase transitions, in order to know at which time important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structures appear.
</em><br>
<p>Well, what I was referring to was the kind of calculation that
<br>
needs to be done in, say, the three-body problem, where one must
<br>
calculate numerical values for differentials, add the results to
<br>
the variables in question, and recalculate the differentials and
<br>
so forth.  The Lorenz equations, as you know, are the prime example,
<br>
(but the Rossler quations are easier to type :-)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x' = -y - z      (where ' denotes derivative with respect to t)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y' = x + ay
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;z' = b + (x - c)z
<br>
<p>It's in this sense that &quot;intermediate&quot; values are needed; one cannot
<br>
simply calculate what x, y, and z are at time t=20, for example.
<br>
<p>As I think you said, there are closed form solutions for exceedingly
<br>
few differential equations, so computer generated solutions always
<br>
take some kind of path like this.  (I was using Greg Egan's phrase
<br>
&quot;intermediate results&quot; mostly to try to read him in the most charitable
<br>
way.)  But here is exactly what I meant by the foregoing paragraph:
<br>
<p>Take the Rossler equations above, for a concrete example.  Given
<br>
particular initial values, they define a mathematical truth.  There
<br>
exist exact real numbers that correspond to values of t, but we can
<br>
never do more than approximate these real values (unlike the case
<br>
with the Collatz iteration, say).  That's all I meant by &quot;the numerical
<br>
solution of differential equations are merely approximations to the
<br>
mathematical truth.&quot;  Is this still problematic?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;But in iterative calculations of this other kind, e.g., Life, chess,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Turing machines, and the disjointed details of our lives on Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the necessary intermediate results **are** the &quot;mathematical&quot; truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmm. Are you meaning &quot;emergent order&quot; ??    [no]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Differential equations (albeit VERY coupled and nonlinear and dissipative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and far-from-equilibrium, and hard to compute on today's computers) can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;model most of these systems.
</em><br>
<p>Am I reading you right?  You believe that chess can be modeled
<br>
by differential equations?  And Turing machines, i.e., computer
<br>
programs?  And Conway's Life?  It's simply not the case that
<br>
differential equations can model these in any useful way, unless
<br>
(again) you're using the term &quot;differential equation&quot; in an
<br>
amazingly broad way.  (I.e., are Conway's Rules further examples
<br>
of what you'd call &quot;differential equations&quot;???)
<br>
<p>Now of course when I write about &quot;our lives on Earth&quot;, that's so
<br>
broad that of course some aspects are captured extremely well by
<br>
differential equations---by many aspects, I submit, cannot be
<br>
so captured.
