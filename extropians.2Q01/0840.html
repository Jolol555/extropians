<em>&gt; (&quot;If it would make most people happy, then I see nothing wrong with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning all professional philosophers into sausages&quot;, as the Swedish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utilitarian Torbjorn Tannsjo said).
</em><br>
<p>Have Swedes honored Torbjorn with the national holiday that he deserves
<br>
for saying this? (Of course sausage is bad for our health, but not nearly
<br>
as pathogenic as in its former state, in this case.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maximising extropy cannot be done globally, it is up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each being (and group of beings) to try to maximise it. When two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings come into conflict over this (say, Robert and I both want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jupiter for our respective M-brains) they could of course use force to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; settle it, but if I did this it would lead to the decrease of extropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Robert (however odd I might find his version of extropy) and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a significant risk of having the conflict spread (for example by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involving our friends, allies and PPLs) that would lead to a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likeliehood of less extropy even for me (and others).
</em><br>
<p>Right. War is not healthy for extropians and other living things, to
<br>
paraphrase a second millenium poster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can develop the above argument into a more watertight ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, but it seems to point at a situation where extropianism would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not lead to everybody against everybody trying to get the last scrap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of computronium, but rather everybody trying to work together to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way out of the box or at least trade the limited resources.
</em><br>
<p>Borg hive wins again. Pogo has seen the assimilator, and it is us.
<br>

<br>
<p>Stay hungry,

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses: consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind,
<br>
free will
