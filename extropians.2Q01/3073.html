I've listened to the first three 23 minute segments so far. At present, my only two negative comments are:
<br>
<p>1. Gray Goo gets mentioned again, flatly, as something that could devastate the world. &quot;In 72 hours.&quot;
<br>
<p>No mention of Freitas' _Biovorous Nanoreplicators and Global Ecophagy_ work, no mention of the Foresight Institute's
<br>
guidelines.
<br>
<p>2. Responding to Art Bell briefly roleplaying a member of Congress, Pesce suggests that government involvement and
<br>
&quot;something like a CDC&quot; is necessary. Again, no mention of the Foresight guidelines, though Foresight Institute was
<br>
mentioned briefly earlier on in the program.  Perhaps Mr. Pesce is unaware of them.
<br>
<p>Regarding the show overall:
<br>
<p>Art Bell has guests from all over the map. Art is very careful to give them all enough rope. Michio Kaku goes on the air
<br>
with him, and he's no slouch, scientifically speaking. From what I've heard so far, Mr. Pesce has done far from a bad
<br>
thing, even if he _has_ just inoculated x million minds with the &quot;gray goo&quot; scenario.
<br>
<p>Russell, feel free to pass these comments on to Mark.
<br>
<p>MMB
