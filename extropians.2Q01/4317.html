<p>DOUGLAS ADAMS (1952 - 2001)
<br>
<p>LAMENT FOR DOUGLAS
<br>
By Richard Dawkins
<br>
[5.14.01]
<br>
<p>This is not an obituary, there'll be time enough for them. It is not 
<br>
a tribute, not a considered assessment of a brilliant life, not a 
<br>
eulogy. It is a keening lament, written too soon to be balanced, too 
<br>
soon to be carefully thought through. Douglas, you cannot be dead.
<br>
<p>A sunny Saturday morning in May, ten past seven, shuffle out of bed, 
<br>
log in to e-mail as usual. The usual blue bold headings drop into 
<br>
place, mostly junk, some expected, and my gaze absently follows them 
<br>
down the page. The name Douglas Adams catches my eye and I smile. 
<br>
That one, at least, will be good for a laugh. Then I do the classic 
<br>
double-take, back up the screen. What did that heading actually say? 
<br>
Douglas Adams died of a heart attack a few hours ago. Then that other 
<br>
cliché, the words swelling before my eyes. It must be part of the 
<br>
joke. It must be some other Douglas Adams. This is too ridiculous to 
<br>
be true. I must still be asleep. I open the message, from a 
<br>
well-known German software designer. It is no joke, I am fully awake. 
<br>
And it is the right - or rather the wrong - Douglas Adams. A sudden 
<br>
heart attack, in the gym in Santa Barbara. &quot;Man, man, man, man oh 
<br>
man,&quot; the message concludes,
<br>
<p>Man indeed, what a man. A giant of a man, surely nearer seven foot 
<br>
than six, broad-shouldered, and he did not stoop like some very tall 
<br>
men who feel uncomfortable with their height. But nor did he swagger 
<br>
with the macho assertiveness that can be intimidating in a big man. 
<br>
He neither apologised for his height, nor flaunted it. It was part of 
<br>
the joke against himself.
<br>
<p>One of the great wits of our age, his sophisticated humour was 
<br>
founded in a deep, amalgamated knowledge of literature and science, 
<br>
two of my great loves. And he introduced me to my wife - at his 
<br>
fortieth birthday party. He was exactly her age, they had worked 
<br>
together on Dr Who. Should I tell her now, or let her sleep a bit 
<br>
longer before shattering her day? He initiated our togetherness and 
<br>
was a recurrently important part of it. I must tell her now.
<br>
<p>Douglas and I met because I sent him an unsolicited fan letter - I 
<br>
think it is the only time I have ever written one. I had adored The 
<br>
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Then I read Dirk Gently's Holistic 
<br>
Detective Agency. As soon as I finished it I turned back to page one 
<br>
and read it straight through again - the only I time I have ever done 
<br>
that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied that he was a fan of my 
<br>
books, and he invited me to his house in London. I have seldom met a 
<br>
more congenial spirit. Obviously I knew he would be funny. What I 
<br>
didn't know was how deeply read he was in science. I should have 
<br>
guessed, for you can't understand many of the jokes in Hitchhiker if 
<br>
you don't know a lot of advanced science. And in modern electronic 
<br>
technology he was a real expert. We talked science a lot, in private, 
<br>
and even in public at literary festivals and on the wireless or 
<br>
television. And he became my guru on all technical problems. Rather 
<br>
than struggle with some ill-written and incomprehensible manual in 
<br>
Pacific Rim English, I would fire off an e-mail to Douglas. He would 
<br>
reply, often within minutes, whether in London or Santa Barbara, or 
<br>
some hotel room anywhere in the world. Unlike most staffers of 
<br>
professional help lines, Douglas understood exactly my problem, knew 
<br>
exactly why it was troubling me, and always had the solution ready, 
<br>
lucidly and amusingly explained. Our frequent e-mail exchanges 
<br>
brimmed with literary and scientific jokes and affectionately 
<br>
sardonic little asides. His technophilia shone through, but so did 
<br>
his rich sense of the absurd. The whole world was one big Monty 
<br>
Python sketch, and the follies of humanity are as comic in the 
<br>
world's silicon valleys as anywhere else.
<br>
<p>He laughed at himself with equal good humour. At, for example, his 
<br>
epic bouts of writer's block (&quot;I love deadlines. I love the whooshing 
<br>
noise they make as they go by&quot;) when, according to legend, his 
<br>
publisher and book agent would literally lock him in a hotel room, 
<br>
with no telephone, and nothing to do but write, releasing him only 
<br>
for supervised walks. If his enthusiasm ran away with him and he 
<br>
advanced a biological theory too eccentric for my professional 
<br>
scepticism to let pass, his mien at my dismissal of it would always 
<br>
be more humorously self-mocking than genuinely crestfallen. And he 
<br>
would have another go.
<br>
<p>He laughed at his own jokes, which good comedians are supposed not 
<br>
to, but he did it with such charm that the jokes became even funnier. 
<br>
He was gently able to poke fun without wounding, and it would be 
<br>
aimed not at individuals but at their absurd ideas. To illustrate the 
<br>
vain conceit that the universe must be somehow pre-ordained for us, 
<br>
because we are so well-suited to live in it, he mimed a wonderfully 
<br>
funny imitation of a puddle of water, fitting itself snugly into a 
<br>
depression in the ground, the depression uncannily being exactly the 
<br>
same shape as the puddle. Or there's this parable, which he told with 
<br>
huge enjoyment, whose moral leaps out with no further explanation. A 
<br>
man didn't understand how televisions work, and was convinced that 
<br>
there must be lots of little men inside the box. manipulating images 
<br>
at high speed. An engineer explained to him about high frequency 
<br>
modulations of the electromagnetic spectrum, about transmitters and 
<br>
receivers, about amplifiers and cathode ray tubes, about scan lines 
<br>
moving across and down a phosphorescent screen. The man listened to 
<br>
the engineer with careful attention, nodding his head at every step 
<br>
of the argument. At the end he pronounced himself satisfied. He 
<br>
really did now understand how televisions work. &quot;But I expect there 
<br>
are just a few little men in there, aren't there?&quot;
<br>
<p>Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the 
<br>
mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender (he 
<br>
once climbed Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit to raise money to fight the 
<br>
cretinous trade in rhino horn), Apple Computer has lost its most 
<br>
eloquent apologist. And I have lost an irreplaceable intellectual 
<br>
companion and one of the kindest and funniest men I ever met. I 
<br>
officially received a happy piece of news yesterday, which would have 
<br>
delighted him. I wasn't allowed to tell anyone during the weeks I 
<br>
have secretly known about it, and now that I am allowed to it is too 
<br>
late.
<br>

<br>
<p>The sun is shining, life must go on, seize the day and all those 
<br>
clichés. We shall plant a tree this very day: a Douglas Fir, tall, 
<br>
upright, evergreen. It is the wrong time of year, but we'll give it 
<br>
our best shot. Off to the arboretum.
<br>
<p><p>* * * *
<br>
<p>The tree is planted, and this article completed, all within 24 hours 
<br>
of his death. Was it cathartic? No, but it was worth a try.
