<em>&gt; Here is an interesting twist, based on some of my comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the need for robotic junk retreival systems and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the telepresence robots -- say the zombie 'body' or 'hologram'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is being remotely operated by a real human being (or an SI).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now in this case you can do whatever you want to the body/holo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you are not harming anyone.  However humans are designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have empathy for things that look, walk, and talk like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans (they are also designed to be wary of them until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a trust-bond is developed).  So the tele-operator is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have to be 'tightly' wired to the remote body, such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain caused to the remote body will generate natural reactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the operator.  [Presumably sensory safety devices cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in at extreme levels.]  Now, the operator is getting paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite well for performing this service and have freely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entered into this situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case is the remotely piloted body/holo a zombie?
</em><br>
<p>I know that Robert Heinlein coined the term &quot;waldo&quot; for a
<br>
tele-operated body in the 1942 novella _Waldo_
<br>
( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345330153">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345330153</a> )
<br>
but the most heartbreaking and disturbing fictional exploration of
<br>
this question I have read is Alice Sheldon's (as &quot;James Tiptree, Jr.&quot;)
<br>
&quot;The Girl Who Was Plugged In&quot; which appeared in the
<br>
collections _Warm Worlds and Otherwise_ (1979)
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345280229">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345280229</a>
<br>
and _Her Smoke Rose Up Forever_ (1990)
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0870541609">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0870541609</a>
<br>
both of which seem to be out of print.
<br>
This story was filmed for TV as part of the short-
<br>
lived Sci-Fi Channel series _Welcome to Paradox_, but
<br>
I don't recall it being as effective as the story
<br>
( <a href="http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue76/screen.html">http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue76/screen.html</a> )
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But 'feelings' are gen[e]tico-socio-'thingys' (insert a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here to represent a neurocomputational 'pattern') that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to promote survival.  There is no reason to elevate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to significance (if that is what you are doing).  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are subroutines designed to promote behaviors that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific goal seeking strategies in the framework of the system.
</em><br>
<p>It's not at **all** obvious that &quot;feelings&quot; can be dismissed
<br>
as insignificant in any entity that could be dignified with
<br>
the adjective &quot;intelligent&quot;, despite the hoary SF convention
<br>
of monotone-voiced computers, robots, and aliens,
<br>
including _Trek_'s Mr. Spock and Seven of Nine.  My impression
<br>
from the little neuroscience reading I've done, including
<br>
Gerald Edelman, and a glance at Antonio Damasio's _Descartes'
<br>
Error_ ( <a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/damasio/descartes.html">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/damasio/descartes.html</a> ,
<br>
and see also Damasio's review of Joseph LeDoux's _The Emotional Brain_,
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciam.com/0697issue/0697review1.html">http://www.sciam.com/0697issue/0697review1.html</a> ), is
<br>
that the stereotype of emotionless intelligence may actually
<br>
be an incoherent one.  For Edelman, the &quot;key reentrant loop&quot;
<br>
supporting consciousness involves **both** the newer, quicker parts
<br>
of the brain (categorizing the rapid flux of sensory
<br>
stimuli, or exteroceptive input, and motor behavior) **and** the older,
<br>
slower parts of the brain (categorizing interoceptive input, or &quot;feelings&quot;;
<br>
see <a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/5580.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q00/5580.html</a> .
<br>
Cut the connections between these domains, and there is no consciousness.
<br>
Without feelings, a Jupiter-sized ball of computronium may
<br>
be nothing more than a transcendental adding machine.
<br>
Olaf Stapledon also touched on this idea in _Last and First
<br>
Men_, when a future race of men called the Great Brains
<br>
concluded by means of pure logic that they were fatally
<br>
flawed, and designed a successor race to embody a more
<br>
desirable balance of logic and emotion.
