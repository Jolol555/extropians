</em><br>
<p>The way I would go with that is that religion incorporated offers
<br>
no shot at all, merely an illusion of a shot at an afterlife.  With
<br>
every scientific discovery, we find new possibilities for how
<br>
science incorporated might help reanimate corpsicles.
<br>
<p>Heres one I tried today: if you took the computer that is
<br>
sitting in front of you right this minute and put it in a time
<br>
machine, sending it back one hundred years, you could
<br>
collect the *very best minds* in the world of that time, show
<br>
them the machine and what it can do, and *not one* of
<br>
them would have the foggiest clue how it works.  They
<br>
could take it apart, examine every piece, and the best
<br>
scientists of 1901 would be quite profoundly baffled.
<br>
<p>Likewise 100 years from now there will be machines
<br>
that even the most insightful among us will declare
<br>
indistinguishable from magic.
<br>
<p>So Pascal himself would surely agree, were he living today,
<br>
that the modern person's best bet is with science and
<br>
not religion.  spike
