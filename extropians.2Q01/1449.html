<p>Ah, well, as much as I elevate Lee's (and Hal's) discussion points
<br>
because of their depth and knowledge, I must simply state in
<br>
this case, they are wrong.  (Note that I do not state they
<br>
are less than wrong).
<br>
<p>I'm unclear what a 'self-contained' unit has to do with it.
<br>
Clearly this requires significant expansion of definitions.
<br>
A human that is can be verified to be human in every respect?
<br>
Or a human that can be verified to be human to the degree
<br>
we interact with most humans but they are really nanotech
<br>
enhanced humans.  I.e. they can interact with us but can
<br>
dissipate ~10^7-10^9 J of 'waste heat' (by dumping it
<br>
into a large quantity of frozen CO2 that is slowly outgassed
<br>
for example).   Their internal dry-ice sink is reintialized
<br>
each evening during 'regeneration'.  They aren't 'human' but
<br>
they look and walk and talk like 'humans' except their
<br>
computational capacity is way beyond ours.
<br>
<p>Also, are you imposing an EM 'sterile' environment on your
<br>
'self-contained' unit (i.e. they cannot be tele-operated)?
<br>
<p>The reasons for the above clarifications points out that if
<br>
you cannot guarantee that your 'zombie' is operating with the
<br>
computational hardware that normal humans are based on,
<br>
I believe the argument completely fails.  At some level
<br>
of technological sophistication, I can statistically 'emulate'
<br>
human behaviors (i.e. given these inputs produce thse outputs)
<br>
and the humans would not have a clue that they were dealing
<br>
with a zombie vs. a real person.  You *DO NOT* need
<br>
consciousness or feelings.  You simply need to replicate
<br>
the most common responses in those situations.  That is
<br>
something that is entirely programmable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, in the classic definition, there cannot be any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such thing as a zombie.  So no observer can be a zombie, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they cannot exist.  It's either an emulation --- in which case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has everything that we do, or it's a simulation --- in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case it's merely a portrayal, a moving picture, as it were.
</em><br>
<p>You will have to split hairs here -- is a statistical
<br>
response behavioral unit an 'emulation'?  If you say yes,
<br>
then I would argue that it does not have everything we do.
<br>
<p>I would argue a statistical response behavioral unit is
<br>
much closer to a 'portrayal'.  I would also argue that
<br>
few humans have the necessary tools to distinguish between
<br>
an emulation and a portrayal.
