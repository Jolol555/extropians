</em><br>
<p>Depends on what you consider success. Legislation against nuclear
<br>
proliferation internationally has been generally successful, given the
<br>
relative handful of actual enforcement actions taken in the last 50
<br>
years. Legislation against civil use of nuclear technology has been
<br>
highly successful in making it far more expensive than it should be, and
<br>
in limiting access to technology.
<br>
<p>That the few instances of violations are so sensationalized is the
<br>
exception proving the rule of successful enforcement. The more
<br>
technically complex a technology is, the easier it is to legally limit
<br>
access to it, because you can legislate who can be taught the knowledge
<br>
needed for the technology, and you can legislate the legal liabilities
<br>
for those who misuse it. Note the legislation against common civilian
<br>
use of explosives over the last decade. Time was a farmer needing to get
<br>
rid of some stumps could mix up some ANFO devices in his workshop. Now
<br>
anyone who does that is considered a public threat and prosecuted.
