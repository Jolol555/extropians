Jeff's idea is to my knowledge novel and quite provocative.
<br>
<p>Now obviously since from Spike's comments we know solar
<br>
sailing is possible, one could in theory surround the
<br>
sun with a ballon of solar-sail thickness which should
<br>
be supported quite happily even without spinning it.
<br>
<p>You probably need to run Buckytube cables around the
<br>
the thing to provide the strength necessary to support
<br>
micrometeorite punctures and resist the pressures resulting
<br>
from solar flares.  Lots of calculations to do here to
<br>
study the feasibility I suspect.
<br>
<p>I don't like Ander's application of all of the mass in the
<br>
solar system to this application because it doesn't seem
<br>
necessary.  (I also get about twice as much material as he
<br>
does to work with in the solar system -- something we need
<br>
to resolve at some point...).  His number is for a sphere
<br>
at 1 AU which doesn't have to apply to Jeff's proposal.
<br>
<p>A principle you can try to work with is how do you
<br>
make the best use of the available energy with the
<br>
smallest amount of material possible.  If you only
<br>
use a fraction of the available material for Jeff's
<br>
Dyson *SPHERE* Lite, then Ander's can use the rest of
<br>
it for building a Nutronomium-Brain (I forget what he
<br>
calls these).
<br>
<p>Now the question is what kind of a good computer architecture
<br>
can you fit on top of a Dyson Shell Lite.  The one that comes
<br>
to mind for me is a 2-D cellular automata.  I.e. no 1-cm^3
<br>
rod-logic CPU's, instead you cover the surface with
<br>
very thin CPU's that only communicate with their nearest
<br>
neighbors.  Now, what kind of calculation that is good for
<br>
I don't know (we really need to get some heavyweights
<br>
in computational architectures on this list).  It seems
<br>
to me that a Dyson Sphere Lite is also a &quot;memory&quot; lite
<br>
architecture since you don't have many atoms around in which
<br>
to store your information.  So Jeff's architecture weighs
<br>
in with a high computational capacity / memory ratio.
<br>
Perhaps this is useful when a rogue &quot;un&quot;-friendly
<br>
MBrain comes marauding through your solar system
<br>
(because a nearby gamma-ray burst it once experienced
<br>
flipped several bits in Eliezer Yudkowsky's finely-tuned
<br>
but fragile &quot;friendliness&quot; algorithm), and steals the
<br>
bulk of your computronium, leaving you with some matter dregs
<br>
that it wasn't worth the energy cost to alter course to harvest.
<br>
<p>If you want to avoid heating up the sun, you are going to
<br>
have to simply take the hits caused by the UV photons and
<br>
the solar wind (i.e. you can't reflect them back to the sun).  
<br>
Your nanobots are going to have to run around continually
<br>
taking apart and reassmbling the high-energy exposed surfaces
<br>
to get them back to 100% efficiency.  But hey, that's life.
<br>
You may have an interesting problem that you have to continually
<br>
throw away the material you are accumulating from the solar
<br>
wind (otherwise you upset your delicate balance between
<br>
the gravitational attraction and the support the wind provides).
<br>
Or you could use it to &quot;grow&quot; your sphere (but doesn't this
<br>
become unbalanced at some point???).
<br>
<p>There is one other way of handling a &quot;sphere&quot; architecture but
<br>
it requires a *lot* of material (probably more than we
<br>
have available).  That is the method used by Anderson
<br>
and Pohl in &quot;The Saga of the Cuckoo&quot;.  They use momentum
<br>
transfer of large fluid volumes to provide the support
<br>
(you could also probably use particle beams).  However
<br>
that to me seems to be a recipe for wasting a lot of
<br>
energy that could otherwise be used to power your
<br>
computronium.  But in that &quot;reality&quot; the whole point of
<br>
the sphere was to provide a &quot;world&quot; in which sub-optimal
<br>
CHNO based life-forms could exist, so you don't have the
<br>
freedom that we do to consider things like Virtual Realities
<br>
based on solar-wind suspended solar-sails with micron thick
<br>
computers.
<br>
<p>Lets try in the discussions to be careful with terms --
<br>
a &quot;shell&quot; would be lots of nested orbiting satellites
<br>
(like a Matrioshka Brain), a &quot;sphere&quot; would be a standard
<br>
fully contiguous surface.  These ideas have been misunderstood
<br>
for too long and its time to set them right.

<br>
<p>Jeff, there are detailed calculations that have been done
<br>
on some of the support issues by several Russian scientists
<br>
that I've had &quot;roughly&quot; translated.  If you want to go into
<br>
this in more detail, send me a formal request for access
<br>
to the database if you can't click through to the papers.
