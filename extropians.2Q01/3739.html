<em>&gt; I guess this is part of the problem Natasha pointed out: how much we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like each other has little to say how much good stuff we actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute, and is far too one-dimensional. Clique formation can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly happen when we deal with actual content (for example by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formation of the &quot;Singularity now!&quot; gang vs &quot;AI is hard and slow&quot; gang
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; social behavior of humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, a mailing list ought to be a wonderful source of information for
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm sure Javien has thought of all this, and it'll be interesting to
<br>
see what they release... anyway, it sounds like the raw reputation
<br>
number should be augmented by a second number - &quot;breadth&quot; - to try
<br>
to give an idea how widely that &quot;opinion&quot; is held. If a few people
<br>
get together and rate each other to the max, but everyone else doesn't
<br>
particpate then that small group would have a low breadth. Or high
<br>
&quot;uncertainty&quot;. I'm sure there are better terms to use, but you get the
<br>
idea. One number is probably not enough to provide a really usable
<br>
reputation system. We need stats stats stats.
