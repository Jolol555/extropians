I consider Warwicks speculations combined with his media savy a quite 
<br>
worrying threat to transhumanism. The risk is that he manages to do 
<br>
spectacular stunts, drawing attention to his ideas about the imminent 
<br>
cybercalypse, helping spread an anti-AI sentiment (&quot;terrestrialism&quot; in the 
<br>
terms of Hugo de Garis, who is doing nearly the same thing). The problem here 
<br>
is that he has not really given much thought to likely development paths and 
<br>
forms of human-AI interaction. This is why the E5 panels about this issue are 
<br>
so important: we better do the analysis and start a more serious debate on 
<br>
how to make AI social than professor Warwick does.
<br>
<p>I admire the courage of him and his wife, though.
