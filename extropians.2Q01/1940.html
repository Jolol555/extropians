Ian Clarke, inventor of Freenet, has an essay at
<br>
<a href="http://freenetproject.org/index.php?page=fairshare">http://freenetproject.org/index.php?page=fairshare</a> proposing a system
<br>
called FairShare to fund artists if copyright fails.  He writes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider a simplistic view of how a record label operates. They find
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;early-stage bands who are yet to have a wide audience, but who they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider to have the potential to be very successful. They invest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money in that band, and if that band does indeed become a success
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they make a return on their investment.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FairShare essentially democratizes this process. Anybody can &quot;invest&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an artist, and if that artist goes on to be a success, then the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person is reward in proportion to their investment and how early they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But where does this return on investment come from? The answer is that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it comes from subsequent investors. For example, lets say that you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invest $10. $4.50 might go straight to the band, $1 might go to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operator of the system, and the remaining $4.50 would be distributed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among previous investors in the band, those who invested more early
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would get a bigger proportion than those who invested less, later-on.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, most people will not make a profit, but they are rewarded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by knowing that they contributed towards an artist that they liked,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and helped reward others who believed in that artist, and who may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have brought the artist to their attention.
<br>
<p>I think Robin Hanson proposed an idea something like this, but more
<br>
generally as a way of funding people early in their lives when they are
<br>
not yet very productive.  A person could sell shares in their future
<br>
earnings and then the investors would profit if the person was successful.
<br>
<p>Clarke's idea is a little different in that you make money by getting
<br>
an immediate share of future investments made in the artist.  If we
<br>
stipulate that artists would be unable to make significant money from
<br>
marketing their products without copyright protection, this method funds
<br>
artists and at the same time rewards the investors.
<br>
<p>Economically the scheme seems questionable, as you would not have much
<br>
incentive to invest late in an artist's career, since he' already
<br>
attracted all the fans he ever will.  But that means that earlier
<br>
investors would not be rewarded much either, since late investors won't
<br>
exist.  The whole pyramid will collapse once people realized that the
<br>
eventual payout won't happen.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a real economist could come up with a scheme along these lines
<br>
that would be more sound.
