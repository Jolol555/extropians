</em><br>
<p>Well, keep in mind that muslims who come here from arab/turkish/persian
<br>
nations are generally moving here either for economic opportunity or
<br>
else using such opportunity to live in a more free society, i.e. its a
<br>
filtration process. Sampling muslims in their native environment should
<br>
also be done. While I personally have no direct experience, I know
<br>
several female military vets who had been stationed in Saudi Arabia and
<br>
found themselves targets of highly offensive behavior, so much so that
<br>
none would or could leave base without a significant male escort. There
<br>
are also different muslim societies. Egypt, for example, is very
<br>
cosmopolitan in the cities, but many rural areas are highly
<br>
fundamentalist, and while Kuwaitis and citizens of the UAE are highly
<br>
liberal, their neighbors are not so. This is similar to the significant
<br>
differences in opinion between US and Israeli jews on issues like
<br>
mideast peace and firearms.
