<p>Again, from the FAQ:
<br>
<p>I.4.7 What are the criteria for investment decisions?
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secI4.html#seci47">http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secI4.html#seci47</a>
<br>
<p>Obviously, a given society needs to take into account
<br>
changes in consumption and so invest in new means of
<br>
production. An anarchist society is no different. As
<br>
G.D.H Cole points out, &quot;it is essential at all times,
<br>
and in accordance with considerations which vary from
<br>
time to time, for a community to preserve a balance
<br>
between production for ultimate use and production for
<br>
use in further production. And this balance is a
<br>
matter which ought to be determined by and on behalf
<br>
of the whole community.&quot; [Guild Socialism Restated, p.
<br>
144] 
<br>
<p>How this balance is determined varies according to the
<br>
school of anarchist thought considered. All agree,
<br>
however, that such an important task should be under
<br>
effective community control. The mutualists see the
<br>
solution to the problems of investment as creating a
<br>
system of mutual banks, which reduce interest rates to
<br>
zero. This would be achieved &quot;[b]y the organisation of
<br>
credit, on the principle of reciprocity or mutualism.
<br>
. .In such an organisation credit is raised to the
<br>
dignity of a social function, managed by the
<br>
community; and, as society never speculates upon its
<br>
members, it will lend its credit . . .at the actual
<br>
cost of transaction. &quot; [Charles A. Dana, Proudhon and
<br>
his &quot;Bank of the People&quot;, p. 36] This would allow
<br>
money to be made available to those who needed it and
<br>
so break the back of the capitalist business cycle
<br>
(i.e. credit would be available as required, not when
<br>
it was profitable for bankers to supply it) as well as
<br>
capitalist property relations. Under a mutualist
<br>
regime, credit for investment would be available from
<br>
two sources. Firstly, an individual's or cooperatives
<br>
own saved funds and, secondly, as zero interest loans
<br>
from mutual banks, credit unions and other forms of
<br>
credit associations. Loans would be allocated to
<br>
projects which the mutual banks considered likely to
<br>
succeed and repay the original loan. 
<br>
<p>Collectivist and communist anarchists recognise that
<br>
credit is based on human activity, which is
<br>
represented as money. As the Guild Socialist G.D.H.
<br>
Cole pointed out, &quot;The understanding of this point [on
<br>
investment] depends on a clear appreciation of the
<br>
fact that all real additions to capital take the form
<br>
of directing a part of the productive power of labour
<br>
and using certain materials not for the manufacture of
<br>
products and the rendering of services incidental to
<br>
such manufacture for purposes of purposes of further
<br>
production.&quot; [Guild Socialism Restated, p. 143]
<br>
Collectivist and Communist anarchists agree with their
<br>
Mutualist cousins when they state that &quot;[a]ll credit
<br>
presupposes labor, and, if labor were to cease, credit
<br>
would be impossible&quot; and that the &quot;legitimate source
<br>
of credit&quot; was &quot;the labouring classes&quot; who &quot;ought to
<br>
control it&quot; and &quot;whose benefit [it should] be used&quot;
<br>
[Charles A. Dana, Op. Cit., p. 35] 
<br>
<p>Therefore, in collectivism, investment funds would
<br>
exist in the confederations of collectives, community
<br>
&quot;banks&quot; and other such means by which depreciation
<br>
funds could be stored and as well as other funds
<br>
agreed to by the collectives (for example, collectives
<br>
may agree to allocate a certain percentage of their
<br>
labour notes to a common account in order to have the
<br>
necessary funds available for new investment). In a
<br>
communist-anarchist society, the collectives would
<br>
agree that a certain part of their output and activity
<br>
will be directed to new means of production. In
<br>
effect, each collective is able to draw upon the sums
<br>
approved of by the Commune in the form of an agreed
<br>
claim on the labour power of all the collectives. In
<br>
this way, mutual aid ensures a suitable pool of
<br>
resources for the future from which all benefit. 
<br>
<p>As to when investment is needed, its clear that this
<br>
will be based on the changes in demand for goods. As
<br>
Guilliame points it, &quot;[b]y means of statistics
<br>
gathered from all the communes in a region, it will be
<br>
possible to scientifically balance production and
<br>
consumption. In line with these statistics, it will
<br>
also be possible to add more help in industries where
<br>
production is insufficient and reduce the number of
<br>
men where there is a surplus of production.&quot; [Bakunin
<br>
on Anarchism, p. 370] Obviously, investment in
<br>
branches of production with a high demand would be
<br>
essential and this would be easily seen from the
<br>
statistics generated by the collectives and communes.
<br>
Tom Brown states this obvious point: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Goods, as now, will be produced in greater variety,
<br>
for workers like producing different kinds, and new
<br>
models, of goods. Now if some goods are unpopular,
<br>
they will be left on the shelves. . . Of other goods
<br>
more popular, the shops will be emptied. Surely it is
<br>
obvious that the assistant will decrease his order of
<br>
the unpopular line and increase his order of the
<br>
popular.&quot; [Syndicalism, p. 55] 
<br>
<p>As a rule of thumb, syndicates that produce investment
<br>
goods would be inclined to supply other syndicates who
<br>
are experiencing excess demand before others, all
<br>
other things being equal. Such guidelines and
<br>
communication between producers, investment would go
<br>
to those industries that actually required them. 
<br>
<p>As production would be decentralised as far as
<br>
possible, each locality would be able to understand
<br>
its own requirements and apply them as it sees fit. 
<br>
<p>This, combined with an extensive communications
<br>
network, would ensure that investment not only did not
<br>
duplicate unused plant within the economy but that
<br>
investments take into account the specific problems
<br>
and opportunities each locality has. Of course,
<br>
collectives would experiment with new lines and
<br>
technology as well as existing lines and so invest in
<br>
new technologies and products. As occurs under
<br>
capitalism, extensive consumer testing would occur
<br>
before dedicating major investment decisions to new
<br>
products. In the case of new technology and plant,
<br>
cost benefit analysis (as outlined in section I.4.4)
<br>
would be used to determine which technology would
<br>
produce the best results and whether changes should be
<br>
made in plant stock. 
<br>
<p>Similarly with communities. A commune will obviously
<br>
have to decide upon and plan civic investment (e.g.
<br>
new parks, housing and so forth). They will also have
<br>
the deciding say in industrial developments in their
<br>
area as it would be unfair for syndicate to just
<br>
decide to build a cement factory next to a housing
<br>
cooperative if they did not want it. There is a case
<br>
for arguing that the local commune will decide on
<br>
investment decisions for syndicates in its area (for
<br>
example, a syndicate may produce X plans which will be
<br>
discussed in the local commune and 1 plan finalised
<br>
from the debate). For regional decisions (for example,
<br>
a new hospital) would be decided at the appropriate
<br>
level, with information fed from the health syndicate
<br>
and consumer cooperatives. The actual location for
<br>
investment decisions will be worked out by those
<br>
involved. However, local syndicates must be the focal
<br>
point for developing new products and investment plans
<br>
in order to encourage innovation. 
<br>
<p>Therefore, under social anarchism no capital market is
<br>
required to determine whether investment is required
<br>
and what form it would take. The work that apologists
<br>
for capitalism claim currently is done by the stock
<br>
market can be replaced by cooperation and
<br>
communication between workplaces in a decentralised,
<br>
confederated network. The relative needs of different
<br>
consumers of a product can be evaluated by the
<br>
producers and an informed decision reached on where it
<br>
would best be used. 
<br>
<p>Without a capital market, housing, workplaces and so
<br>
on will no longer be cramped into the smallest space
<br>
possible. Instead, housing, schools, hospitals,
<br>
workplaces and so on will be built within a &quot;green&quot;
<br>
environment. This means that human constructions will
<br>
be placed within a natural environment and no longer
<br>
stand apart from it. In this way human life can be
<br>
enriched and the evils of cramping as many humans and
<br>
things into a small a space as is &quot;economical&quot; can be
<br>
overcome. 
<br>
<p>In addition, the stock market is hardly the means by
<br>
which capital is actually raised within capitalism. As
<br>
Engler points out, &quot;Supporters of the system... claim
<br>
that stock exchanges mobilise funds for business. Do
<br>
they? When people buy and sell shares, 'no investment
<br>
goes into company treasuries... Shares simply change
<br>
hands for cash in endless repetition.' Company
<br>
treasuries get funds only from new equity issues.
<br>
These accounted for an average of a mere 0.5 per cent
<br>
of shares trading in the US during the 1980s.&quot;
<br>
[Apostles of Greed, pp. 157-158] And it hardly needs
<br>
to be repeated that capitalism results in production
<br>
being skewed away from the working class and that the
<br>
&quot;efficiency&quot; of market allocation is highly suspect. 
<br>
<p>Only by taking investment decisions away from
<br>
&quot;experts&quot; and placing it in the hands of ordinary
<br>
people will current generations be able to invest
<br>
according to their, and future generations,
<br>
self-interest. It is hardly in our interest to have a
<br>
institution whose aim is to make the wealthy even
<br>
wealthier and on whose whims are dependent the lives
<br>
of millions of people.
