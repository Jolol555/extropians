<p>I would say that there is a conflict between deep seated beliefs that
<br>
one already knows the way it really is and truth.    It doesn't matter
<br>
if those deep seated beliefs are based upon science or religion.  It is
<br>
the inability to question and change that is the culprit.  
<br>
<p>I always find it amazing that many in whose name religions were founded
<br>
often explicitly advised their disciples to question everything and only
<br>
accept that which they could prove in their own life, mind and heart. 
<br>
It only takes a generation or two before that advice is lost and some of
<br>
their words and ideas mangled along the way become dogma.  Soon
<br>
thereafter they would themselves be killed by the resulting &quot;followers&quot;
<br>
for heresy.
<br>
<p>I also find it amazing when those who consider themselves rational and
<br>
scientific lock their thinking within the tight bounds of what they
<br>
think is the last word of science or lock the future and all its
<br>
possibilities into an infinitely multiplied and more powerful increase
<br>
of what is and was. Many  seem helpless to see that we now have much
<br>
more freedom to choose what will be than we have ever had.  Many are too
<br>
busy fighting old superstition to be able to distill new vision.  And so
<br>
we rocket into a future of infinite possibilities locked in a deadly
<br>
embrace from the past with no idea of where we wish to go or what we
<br>
wish to create.  We waste energy trying to disown various of the prime
<br>
energies, focuses and tools of our species and to cleave to the &quot;only
<br>
true way&quot; yet again.
