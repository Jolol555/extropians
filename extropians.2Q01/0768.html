From: &quot;Neal Blaikie&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:nrb@porterville.k12.ca.us?Subject=Re:%20People%20believe%20what%20they%20want%20to%20believe(.)&In-Reply-To=&lt;002901c0ae64$82b2ea60$1a5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">nrb@porterville.k12.ca.us</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; People simply believe what they want to believe. Period. When someone
</em><br>
decides
<br>
<em>&gt; to not believe in something anymore, or to start believing in something
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; haven't believed before, it is ultimately a personal decision.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, people believe what they want to believe... politically,
<br>
economically, theologically, socially, and in every other way. There's
<br>
even evidence from behavior genetics that mostly people's political
<br>
ideologies are genetically inheritable. Whatever context you grow up in,
<br>
to some extent the kinds of attitudes and beliefs you have about political
<br>
issues and social issues, does not seem terribly much affected by the
<br>
intellectual environment that you're exposed to-people pick up the ideas
<br>
that fit with their preconceptions and they reject those that don't. It's
<br>
a mistake to credit science with too much importance in shaping people's
<br>
attitudes towards other people, towards government policy, towards social
<br>
priorities-once you know what social priorities you want to pursue,
<br>
science is very helpful in suggesting effective ways of pursuing them. But
<br>
it's a mistake to confuse science with ideology. Ideologues always pick up
<br>
whatever science looks like it will fit their cause and they distort it
<br>
and present it and support it and they'll try to use it to convince
<br>
others, but that doesn't mean that scientists should go around trying to
<br>
censor themselves for fear that their ideas will be picked up and used by
<br>
the wrong people. The wrong people always pick up and use any ideas they
<br>
want in the wrong way. There are so many ideas out there anyway that good
<br>
people can already do good with the ideas at hand and evil people can do
<br>
evil with the ideas at hand.
<br>
Let's take one rather provocative piece of research. There's some evidence
<br>
from behavior genetics now, some evidence, not a lot, but a little bit,
<br>
that happiness itself is somewhat inheritable. If you're extremely
<br>
reactionary and conservative you could say Ah! See, we can't do anything
<br>
for people, they'll just be happy or not as they see fit; there's no point
<br>
in trying to improve people's lives. On the other hand you could be a
<br>
radical socialist and you could take this as a profound critique of
<br>
capitalist consumerism-you could say people have been duped into believing
<br>
that the more stuff they acquire the happier they'll be. That is
<br>
empirically not the case. You could take it either direction. You could
<br>
also just say well, pragmatically speaking, if you want happy kids, marry
<br>
somebody happy. Any different scientific discovery can be taken in a
<br>
thousand different ideological directions for a thousand different
<br>
purposes.

<br>
free will
