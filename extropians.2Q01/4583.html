Eugene, most of these were not nerve gasses but other agents such as EA1289. 
<br>
<p>I was trying to remember which were the ergots that had litte impact on the
<br>
people taking them but impacted other around them with a contact high. The
<br>
empathy training group ones.
<br>
<p>There is a class of chemical warfare agents --  interogation agents, that if
<br>
the person is suspectable you can get them to tell you or do almost anything. 
<br>
<p>Before everyone jumps all over me for suggesting you drug someone, I would not
<br>
suggest that -- it would be date rape.
<br>
<p>You don't give them to the person, you take them yourself! They have no or
<br>
little effect on you, but they change the nature of interpersonal behavior
<br>
(called the interpersonal reflex) and the other person develops a strong
<br>
empathy to you. If you know anyone in this field at Edgewood Arsenal or
<br>
similar mititary labs they should be able to tell you what that are. There
<br>
existance is no secret.
<br>
A lot of care is needed, if you are in public you can find yourself turning
<br>
people on without even knowing it.
<br>
Well you won't notice it, they will and they will have no idea what is
<br>
happening to them except that they will find themselves more happy, friendly
<br>
and open.
<br>
<p>The other interesting side effect is that these were potent life extension
<br>
agents.
<br>
<p>So please skip the nerve gasses!
<br>
<p>Best Ralph
