<em>&gt; &gt; Seems to me like the death penalty is more a case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legalized communal revenge than anything to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justice. The idea that a Govt. can actually kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone is disturbing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Isn't the idea that a government can put you in prison for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life, deny you any chance to pursue a career, or marry, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;travel, or even have children equally disturbing to you?
</em><br>
<p>As disturbing as ending that existence?  Not by a mile, no.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You perhaps may want to bring about a situation where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person A can in fact kill person B, but no government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can kill person A regardless of what he has done.
</em><br>
<p>Person A can in fact kill person B, but it is violating the law.  Why 
<br>
should a Government be allowed to bypass that law?  For the protection of 
<br>
society?  I've yet to see a good reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, isn't it better to let ten thousand guilty men
</em><br>
<em>&gt;go free rather than deprive an innocent man of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;livelihood, his freedom, and his family? (Never mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what the ten thousand guilty men may do; apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what's important is that our own hands, i.e., our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government's hands, remain clean.)
</em><br>
<p>I fail to see the connection between the 10,000 &quot;guilty&quot; men and the one 
<br>
&quot;innocent&quot; one.  We don't decide one on the basis of the other.  Let each 
<br>
one be judged on its' own merits.  Justice isn't measured by how many 
<br>
guilty we discard for every innocent.  It isn't a performance ratio.  It's 
<br>
about a process to determine the actual sequence of events and individuals 
<br>
involved in an incident.  And it errs on the side of the accused, for good 
<br>
reason.  If that's having clean hands, be it an individual or Government, 
<br>
then I can certainly live with that.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
