<em>&gt; &gt;From what I've heard, it was designed as a different engine.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saturn V's were likely one of the baslines that the space shuttle main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engines evolved from, though.  (Among other differences: SSMEs tilt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give on-orbit rotational thrust, while Saturn V first stage is straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the back only.)
</em><br>
<p>All three SSME's on the shuttle are gimbaled in two axes; the four outer
<br>
engines on the Saturn V were two axis gimbaled while the center engine
<br>
was fixed.
<br>
<p>Other than being designed and built by the same company, the F-1 and the
<br>
SSME had very little in common- the propellants, turbomachinery cycles,
<br>
thrust levels, fabrication techniques, and chamber pressures were vastly
<br>
different.
