<p>
As certain as I am that there's a been a grave injustice worked here, it is 
<br>
EXTREMELY difficult to offer a meaningful legal opinion about the outcome and 
<br>
possible future course of Keith's case without a detailed review of the 
<br>
record.  It appears from the material that's been forwarded here that a key 
<br>
evidentiary ruling may have strongly prejudiced Keith's case.  However, 
<br>
successfully sustaining an appeal on an evidence point is one of the most 
<br>
difficult pathways through the appellate process one can take, since it is 
<br>
USUALLY necessary to show a firm causal connection between the excluded 
<br>
evidence and the result.  I presume this was a jury trial, which bodes ill 
<br>
for the appeal: Strong presumptions in favor of fact-findings by juries make 
<br>
successful evidentiary-based appeals quite rare.
<br>
<p>Barbara's comments about the evils of &quot;hate crime&quot; laws are well-founded.  
<br>
While intent (or &quot;scienter&quot;, as old lawyers like me still call it) is 
<br>
obviously crucial in criminal cases (providing the distinction between murder 
<br>
and manslaughter, for instance), &quot;hate crimes&quot; go a step further, making a 
<br>
distinction about intent based on the &quot;group&quot; nature or &quot;group&quot; membership of 
<br>
the alleged victim or victims.  As Barbara points out, such laws are 
<br>
fundamentally counter to the liberal tradition of enlightened law, since they 
<br>
move the locus of harm from individuals to groups and dilute the focus on 
<br>
individual rights which is the bedrock of a free society.  
<br>
<p>Beyond this and on a technical constitutional point, Keith appears to have 
<br>
engaged in nothing more than speech, which ought to be protected by the 
<br>
Second Amendment.  I also don't know whether California's &quot;hate crime&quot; 
<br>
statutes have been subjected to federal constitutional scrutiny, but I hope 
<br>
that if that pathway lies open for Keith he can attract the attention of the 
<br>
ACLU or the Institute for Justice (<a href="http://www.ij.org/index.shtml">http://www.ij.org/index.shtml</a>).  I would 
<br>
hope that the latter especially would be willing to look at Keith's case, as 
<br>
I support them with a modest regular donation.  A listing of other public 
<br>
interest law firms can be found at:

<br>
<p>Perhaps Keith's best hope is to work to build a coalition of legal talent 
<br>
among public interest law firms and sympathetic academics who would be 
<br>
willing to take his cause forward through the appellate process.  I just hope 
<br>
they preserved error (the lawyers here will know what I mean :-()
