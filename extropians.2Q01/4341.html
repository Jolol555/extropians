<p>I am thinking of something similar. I have spent far too mych time trying to 
<br>
give a strict derivation of the Bayesian confidence propagation neural 
<br>
network (my professor invented it, but has never got around to make a 
<br>
satisfying derivation - which is bad for getting *my* papers on it published 
<br>
;-), and my current best bet is that it can be derived as some kind of 
<br>
lagrangian multiplier formalism where some information measure (maybe B-L 
<br>
dimension) is optimised under the constraint of some other information 
<br>
measure (maybe entropy). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My question: is this connection recognized and exploited
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do they use the results and strength of the theory and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have not seen much of it, but I recall some derivations in Haykin's Neural 
<br>
Networks that used the multipliers. That doesn't prove much, since he is 
<br>
rather fond of using excessive math to derive simple networks (the chapter of 
<br>
radial basis functions is amazing - he uses Green's functions and functional 
<br>
analysis! Talk about sharpening pencils with millstones).
