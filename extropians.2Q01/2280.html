<em>&gt;From: J Corbally &lt;<a href="mailto:icorb@indigo.ie?Subject=Re:%20The%20pool%20we're%20trying%20to%20paddle%20in&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104131830.LAA10931@well.com&gt;">icorb@indigo.ie</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Not so.  Most atheists I've met would not say &quot;god doesn't exist&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they would say they don't believe it exists.  They're well aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the problem  of making such sweeping claims.  By default,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atheism is merely a lack of god belief.  It can also be a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;assertion of nonexistence&quot;, but this in my experience is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less common, and atheism tends to be described that way in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to strawman it.
</em><br>
<p>Atheism is not merely a lack of God belief, it is a belief that God
<br>
does not exist.
<br>
<p>Webster's Universal College Dictionary:
<br>
<p>Atheism: The doctrine or belief that there is no God.
<br>
<p>Atheist: A person who denies or disbelieves in the existance of a
<br>
supreme being or beings.
<br>
<p>The version most &quot;atheists&quot; you know believe is closer to what I
<br>
thought agnostic meant. I guess we have a golden opportunity to
<br>
define a new term.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I have problems with the &quot;unknowable&quot; bit too, which is why I use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atheist, as it denotes my simple lack of belief.  I've noticed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that most agnostics I've met don't buy the &quot;unknowable&quot; thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;either.  Claiming that something is &quot;unknown&quot; or &quot;unknowable&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just as much an erroneous assertion as &quot;there are no gods&quot;, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are all positive claims(requiring positive proof), even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;currently&quot; is added.  So I stick with atheism, as I make no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assertion other than my own lack of belief.
</em><br>
<p>We appear to believe the same thing, but neither the textbook
<br>
definitions for agnostic nor atheist seem to cover it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;I realize religions have pat (unacceptable) answers to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;questions. Of course a wise person would simply take Pascal's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wager (Blaise, look it up) and say they believe. Come to think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it, I repent!!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, I don't know whether the &quot;wise&quot; person would:)  Then again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lottery ticket is about the level of my betting.
</em><br>
<p>Thats okay as someone else pointed out Pascal's wager is most
<br>
effective as satire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Seems to me like the death penalty is more a case of legalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communal revenge than anything to do with justice.  The idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Govt. can actually kill someone is disturbing.
</em><br>
<p>The idea is to keep individuals from acting on their own, speaking
<br>
of that, check this out:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the May issue of REASON.
</em><br>
<p>Barbara Graham was a speaker at last year's million mom march and
<br>
a member of the group that co-sponsored that rally for gun control.
<br>
Now a District of Columbia court has convicted her of shooting the
<br>
man she thought killed her son. Her victim, who police say was not
<br>
the murderer, is now paralyzed.
<br>
<p>Contrary to some peoples opinion I think the death penalty will
<br>
have a negative reinforcing effect (or deterrent) when it is
<br>
applied at the same level at which the crime occurs.
<br>
<p>There are something like two murders a day in Chicago, but we do
<br>
not execute anything like that number. Everything we've learned
<br>
from psychology to cybernetics has told us we can't expect any
<br>
change at this low level of reinforcement.
