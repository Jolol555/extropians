Lee,
<br>
<p>I don't think your word problems provide the necessary priors.  To
<br>
estimate the probabilities, I would need to know the algorithms used by
<br>
each of the people making statements, and that information is not
<br>
provided.
<br>
<p>For example, suppose that you're on a game show called &quot;ExtroQuiz&quot; and
<br>
there are three doors:  A, B, and C.  One door has a prize behind it.  You
<br>
pick door C.  The game show host opens up door A, and shows you that it's
<br>
empty.  What is the probability that the prize is behind door B?  Answer: 
<br>
0%.  Why?  Because the game show host *knows* the standard answer to this
<br>
riddle, *knows* that most Extropians will switch to B, and he opens A *if
<br>
and only if* the prize is actually behind C.
<br>
<p>The &quot;mathematician's daughters&quot; is a much worse instance of the problem. 
<br>
If you know that the mathematician will say &quot;At least one of my children
<br>
is a girl&quot; for BG, GB, and GG, but say &quot;At least one of my children is a
<br>
boy&quot; only for BB, and the mathematician says &quot;At least one of my children
<br>
is a girl&quot;, then the probability that the other child is a boy is 2/3.  If
<br>
you know that the mathematician will say &quot;At least one is a girl&quot; for GG,
<br>
&quot;At least one is a boy&quot; for BB, and pick a statement at random for BG and
<br>
GB, then the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/2.  I think
<br>
that most people unconsciously assume this kind of symmetry by default -
<br>
it seems, a priori, a more likely visualization of the underlying causes -
<br>
which is why most people return the allegedly &quot;wrong&quot; answer 1/2.  To
<br>
assume otherwise requires that one assume the mathematician has an
<br>
inherent bias towards naming girls, which is an odd thing to assume about
<br>
someone.  The above mixture of probabilities is exactly what results from
<br>
the mathematician picking one child at random and saying &quot;At least one of
<br>
my children is an X&quot;, in which case the statement provides no information
<br>
about the second child.  Most people unconsciously assume that's what the
<br>
mathematician did, in which case the given answer, 1/2, is exactly
<br>
correct.
<br>
<p>I've *always* felt that riddle had a problem; now, twelve years later, I
<br>
finally get to articulate it.
<br>
<p>(In Lee Corbin's question as stated, I expect that the mathematician
<br>
hypothesizes the father to be symmetrical, rather than hypothesizing that
<br>
the father exhibits a feminine bias, and answers 1/2.)
<br>
