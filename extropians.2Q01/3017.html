<p>Industriousness: How It Can Be Learned
<br>
<p>Robert Eisenberger, PhD University of Delaware
<br>
<p>The Romantic tradition in Western civilization, as reflected in
<br>
the writings of humanistic psychologists, values the gentle
<br>
nurture of unique talent as a means to individual success. This
<br>
romantic view gives insufficient recognition to the difficult
<br>
work needed to become proficient in a field of endeavor
<br>
(Eisenberger &amp; Cameron, 1996). Biographical studies of the
<br>
lives of such remarkable scientists and mathematicians as
<br>
Einstein, Feynman, von Neumann, and Ramanujan reveal the
<br>
remarkable persistence required for creative achievement
<br>
(Clark, 1972; Gleick, 1992; Kanigel, 1991; Lanouette, 1992;
<br>
Macrae, 1992).  Some individuals work harder than others who
<br>
have equivalent ability and motivation. One student
<br>
consistently studies more for various courses than another
<br>
student with similar life goals. A teacher carefully prepares
<br>
lessons whereas a colleague relies on old, incomplete notes. A
<br>
factory employee completes tasks rapidly and efficiently
<br>
whereas another dawdles. Learning may contribute importantly to
<br>
such individual differences in industriousness.  Almost seven
<br>
decades ago, J. B. Watson (1930/1970) argued that &quot;the
<br>
formation of early work habits in youth, of working longer
<br>
hours than others, of practicing more intensively than others,
<br>
is probably the most reasonable explanation we have today not
<br>
only for success in any line, but even for genius&quot; (p.
<br>
212). If Watson exaggerated for emphasis, individual
<br>
differences of industriousness do have an important influence
<br>
on achievement. Recent research has shed light on mechanisms
<br>
that contribute to the learning of industriousness.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned Industriousness Theory
<br>
<p>Learned industriousness theory (Eisenberger, 1992)
<br>
asserts that rewarding a difficult task produces
<br>
classical conditioning involving the pairing of effort
<br>
(the conditioned stimulus) with a positive unconditioned
<br>
stimulus (the reward), thereby reducing effort's
<br>
aversiveness. When a difficult task is followed by
<br>
reward, the effort would become less aversive, increasing
<br>
the amount of effort the individual subsequently chooses
<br>
to spend performing this and other difficult tasks.
<br>
Physical effort involves &quot;the subjective experience that
<br>
accompanies bodily movement when it meets resistance or
<br>
when muscles are fatigued&quot; (English &amp; English, 1968,
<br>
p. 171).  Cognitive effort refers to the sensation
<br>
experienced when mental activity encounters impediments
<br>
such as mental fatigue or complex reading material. The
<br>
aversiveness of effort has an evolutionary benefit: a
<br>
species that continually chose the most difficult way to
<br>
obtain food or drink would be at a competitive
<br>
disadvantage. So all higher species seem to follow the
<br>
law of least effort, according to which laborsaving
<br>
changes in behavior for rewards are favored (Hull, 1943;
<br>
Solomon, 1948). Although organisms prefer to achieve
<br>
their goals with least effort, high effort is required
<br>
for achieving long-term goals.  Learned industriousness
<br>
theory assumes that different kinds of physical and
<br>
cognitive tasks produce similar aversive subjective
<br>
experience. For example, the experience of cognitive
<br>
effort the reader expends on this article is similar, in
<br>
the present view, to that involved in writing a term
<br>
paper or figuring out what courses to take. If the
<br>
experience of effort is similar across different tasks,
<br>
then learning to tolerate high effort in one task may
<br>
increase toleration of high effort in subsequent tasks.
<br>
<p>Basic Research Findings
<br>
<p>Extensive research with animals and humans shows that,
<br>
consistent with learned industriousness theory, reward
<br>
for high effort contributes to durable individual
<br>
differences in effort expenditure (Eisenberger,
<br>
1992). Rats required to press a lever with high force for
<br>
food later made more trips in a runway for food than rats
<br>
receiving food for pressing a lever requiring low
<br>
force. Rats required to make five trips in a runway for
<br>
food, as opposed to one trip, subsequently showed a
<br>
greater preference for pressing a heavy lever for a large
<br>
food reward versus a light lever for a small food
<br>
reward. Depressed mental patients asked to carry out
<br>
several custodial tasks by a ward attendant were later
<br>
more persistent in a clerical task administered by
<br>
another invvidual than were comparable patients who had
<br>
received verbal approval for each custodial task. College
<br>
students rewarded for solving difficult cognitive
<br>
problems subsequently wrote better essays than did
<br>
students who had been rewarded for solving easy cognitive
<br>
problems. The effects of rewarded high effort also
<br>
extends to socially important behaviors, such as honesty
<br>
and creativity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honesty
<br>
<p>Reward of high effort could help sustain a person's
<br>
subsequent performance in difficult tasks when the
<br>
opportunity arises to achieve the desired result by
<br>
dishonest behavior. By concentrating on working for a
<br>
desired goal, rather than dwelling on the goal itself, a
<br>
person would be less inclined to resort to dishonest
<br>
shortcuts. An experiment with college students tested
<br>
whether rewarded high performance would increase the
<br>
subsequent resistance to cheating on a different task
<br>
(Eisenberger &amp; Masterson, 1983). One group of students
<br>
was required to solve difficult mathematics problems and
<br>
perceptual identifications. A second group received
<br>
easier versions of these problems, and a third group was
<br>
given no training at all. Next, the students were asked
<br>
to work on a series of anagrams that were almost
<br>
impossible to solve in the short time allotted for each
<br>
word. The students were told that speaking aloud
<br>
interfered with the anagram task and that they should try
<br>
to solve the anagrams without speaking. When the time was
<br>
up for figuring out an anagram, they would be shown the
<br>
correct answer. They were simply to place a plus on the
<br>
answer sheet if they had figured out the answer they were
<br>
shown, and to put a zero if they had not achieved the
<br>
solution.  Cheating seemed simple to the students because
<br>
they never had to supply an answer, simply to claim the
<br>
solution after it was shown to them.  Most of the
<br>
students did cheat. However, the students who had
<br>
previously been required to solve difficult anagrams
<br>
cheated less than the others. Rewarded high performance
<br>
on preliminary tasks reduced the number of anagrams that
<br>
students falsely claimed to solve. These results suggest
<br>
that an individual's honesty is influenced by the
<br>
generalized effects of rewarded high effort.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creativity
<br>
<p>An additional assumption of learned industriousness
<br>
theory is that people learn the dimensions of performance
<br>
(e.g., speed, accuracy, or novelty) required for reward
<br>
and generalize such learning to new tasks. For instance,
<br>
preadolescent students who were rewarded for reading with
<br>
high accuracy subsequently produced more accurate
<br>
drawings and stories than did those who had been rewarded
<br>
for reading with high speed or for the mere completion of
<br>
the reading task. In comparison, students who were
<br>
rewarded for high reading speed subsequently constructed
<br>
stories more quickly than did students who were rewarded
<br>
for high reading accuracy or the mere completion of the
<br>
reading task (Eisenberger, Mitchell, McDermitt, &amp;
<br>
Masterson, 1984).  Creativity involves the generation of
<br>
novel behavior that meets a standard of quality or
<br>
utility. Because daily experience rewards various types
<br>
of conventional performance more frequently than novel
<br>
responding, people promised reward for carrying out
<br>
tasks, without a clear indication that creativity is
<br>
required, may respond conventifinally rather than
<br>
creatively.  Eisenberger, Armeli, and Pretz (1998) found
<br>
that the promise of pay for unspecified drawing
<br>
performance increased the creativity of the children's
<br>
drawings if the children had previously received pay for
<br>
generating novel uses for common objects. Preliminary
<br>
reward for creativity caused the children to interpret
<br>
the subsequent promise of reward for unspecified
<br>
performance as an indication that novelty was needed to
<br>
obtain the reward, causing the children to increase their
<br>
creativity.  These results suggest that reward for
<br>
creative performance produces a generalized increase in
<br>
creativity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion
<br>
<p>The individual's decision concerning how much effort to
<br>
exert in goal-directed behavior is influenced by the
<br>
generalized efforts of prior reward for low or high
<br>
effort. The occurrence of learned individual differences
<br>
in industriousness is shown by a variety of studies both
<br>
with lower animals and humans.  Generalized effects of
<br>
rewarded high effort influence socially important
<br>
activities ranging from cheating to creativity.  Learned
<br>
industriousness theory helps explain why some people work
<br>
harder than others of equivalent ability and motivation.

<p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Robert Eisenberger (born February 11, 1943,
<br>
in New York City) received his BA (1964) from the University of
<br>
California, Los Angeles and his PhD (1972) from the University
<br>
of California, Riverside and is a fellow of the American
<br>
Psychological Association. He taught at State University of New
<br>
York at Albany followed by the University of Delaware where he
<br>
is a professor of psychology. He served as director of the
<br>
social psychology graduate program from 1987 to 1989 and from
<br>
1995 to 1996.  Professor Eisenberger's research centers on
<br>
human motivation. One of his major interests (discussed in the
<br>
accompanying article) involves the study of why some
<br>
individuals generally work harder than others. A related
<br>
research area concerns the study of enjoyment of activities for
<br>
their own sake (intrinsic motivation). His recent findings
<br>
suggest that (a) reward can be used effectively with children
<br>
and employees to increase perceived control over whether and
<br>
how tasks are carried out, perceived competence, task
<br>
enjoyment, and creativity, and (b) expectancies of reward are
<br>
positively related to employees' expression of interest in
<br>
daily job activities, this relationship being stronger among
<br>
persons with a high desire for control.  Professor Eisenberger
<br>
also studies employee motivation. His research in a variety of
<br>
work organizations indicates that (a) employees form general
<br>
beliefs concerning how much the organization values their
<br>
contributions and cares about their well-being (perceived
<br>
organizational support), and (b) based on the norm of
<br>
reciprocity, employees reciprocate such support with increased
<br>
emotional commitment to the organization, work effort in
<br>
standard job activities, and innovative problem solving.
