<em>&gt; My aim would be to get people to consider, as a serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility, that the mind is essentially quantum in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some regard. This is not a wild contingency or an idle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculation; it's only a few steps away from things we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already know, and if true it is likely to have profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences for the shape of things to come.
</em><br>
<p>Well, Mitch, I'll be at Foresight, but I reckon I'll be too busy talking up
<br>
Webmind to serve as your proxy ;&gt;
<br>
<p>My take on the quantum mind, as you know, is this :
<br>
<p>1) It's moderately like that the ~brain~ is in some important sense a
<br>
macroscopic quantum system
<br>
<p>2) The ~mind~ is a nonphysical entity -- a pattern of organization of
<br>
patterns -- and is not intrinsically tied to any particular set of physical
<br>
laws
<br>
<p>3) It's possible that quantum computing as manifested in the brain is
<br>
important to how the human mind works.  For instance, maybe the mind uses QM
<br>
to do efficient average-case problem-solving.
<br>
<p>4) Even if 3 is true, this doesn't mean a digital computer using non-QM
<br>
problem-solving techniques couldn't equal or even exceed the intelligence of
<br>
a human being.  Digital computers have other advantages, such as precision
<br>
of calculations...
<br>
<p>5) Consciousness does, in my view, have a lot to do with the ~unknown~,
<br>
hence with subjective randomness.  But QM is by no means the only source of
<br>
subjective randomness in the world.  Chaos is another, which occurs in
<br>
classical systems.  (Chaotic systems may be non-random in the perspective of
<br>
some mythical observer with infinite-precision data, but in the perspective
<br>
of real observers, they're as random as quantum systems.  And consciousness
<br>
is perceived by real observers.)
