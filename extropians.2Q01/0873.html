</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Related question, maybe the same one-- what is the mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship between the number of intersecting orbital planes (all at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance R, but at different angles) and the number of satellites in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each orbit? In other words, if you just have one orbit, then you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pack it with pi*2R/N satellites. If two such orbits intersect, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously each has to contain fewer satellites (they need to 'take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns' going through the two points of intersection) and so on for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each additional orbit added to the mix, but what is the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship?
</em><br>
<p>Let's imagine that you have a bunch of polar orbits.  Start with one
<br>
satellite in each orbit.  As they cross the north pole, arrange it so
<br>
that the first orbit's satellite crosses, then the next (in longitude)
<br>
orbit's satellite crosses, and so on.  As each satellite crosses the north
<br>
pole, the next and previous satellites have to be about N distance away.
<br>
Therefore the number of polar orbits in use would be proportional to
<br>
R/N.
<br>
<p>The satellite positions at any instant describe a spiral shape that
<br>
starts at the north pole at zero degrees of longitude, heads south and
<br>
passes through the equator at 90 degrees, then reaches the south pole at
<br>
180 degrees of longitude.  It then heads back up again and crosses the
<br>
equator northbound at 90 degrees again, reaching the north pole at 180
<br>
degrees (these are the satellites which have just crossed the north pole).
<br>
This shape intersects itself but the satellites themselves are all in
<br>
polar orbits so only pass at the poles.
<br>
<p>There are actually two satellites in each orbit in this model, one
<br>
crossing the north pole while the other crosses the south pole.  But the
<br>
point is that the total number of satellites is still pi*2R/N, no more
<br>
than can be held in one orbit.  The bottleneck is the point where the
<br>
orbits cross, and the satellites must be &quot;out of phase&quot; by at least N
<br>
miles for it to work, which is what you get with a single orbit as well.
<br>
So you haven't directly gained anything by using multiple orbits all
<br>
crossing at a single pair of points.
<br>
<p>However with a single, packed-full orbit you can't add any more since
<br>
you can't cross it anywhere.  With this orbit you can easily add an
<br>
equatorial orbit at right angles to the polar one.  I think the effect
<br>
of the polar arrangement I described is that the spiral or figure-8
<br>
pattern would appear to rotate equatorially, around the poles, even
<br>
though the actual satellites are of course moving north-south.  As each
<br>
new satellite crosses the poles the entire pattern has rotated by the
<br>
angle between polar orbits.  I think this rotation speed should be the
<br>
same as the speed of an equatorial orbit.  So you can add at least a
<br>
single equatorial orbit and pack it with satellites, leaving a gap where
<br>
the polar pattern crosses the equator.  This basically gives us pi*4R/N
<br>
satellites (not counting the gap).
<br>
<p>Then the question is, can you turn the equatorial orbit into the same
<br>
pattern as the polar orbits, a bunch of orbits crossing at a single point
<br>
on the equator?  By itself this won't gain you anything, you can't put
<br>
more satellites into multiple orbits that cross at a point than into a
<br>
single orbit, as we saw before.  But it might leave room for more orbits.
<br>
I don't know if it would work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a hunch that when there are many orbits, it's best to angle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them such that there are never more than two intersecting. I also have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hunch that for each R there is an optimal number of orbits beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which any additional satellite capacity from more orbits would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offset by the decrease in the number of satellites each of the orbits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to undergo in order to accomodate the new one. I don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to evaluate these hunches, but if they are correct, then I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of envision how a densely populated orbital distance would look--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of like a hollowed out ball of yarn, with relatively large gaps.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is reasonable.  It looks like the most favorable geometry
<br>
for two orbits to intersect is at a small angle, where both orbits are
<br>
moving in the same direction.  Obviously any time orbits intersect we
<br>
must space the satellites within an orbit no closer than 2N, because
<br>
when a satellite crosses another orbit, the closest satellites in that
<br>
other orbit must be at +/- N from it.  It might appear that the most
<br>
favorable geometry would be to intersect orbits at right angles, but
<br>
actually in the frame of reference of the moving satellites that makes
<br>
the intersection look like a 45 degree angle.  So you need to increase
<br>
the spacing by a factor of sqrt(2).  But with a grazing intersection,
<br>
the satellites fall neatly into place interleaved with each other.
<br>
Two orbits intersecting at small angles can each hold pi*R/N satellites,
<br>
so the pair of orbits can hold pi*2R/N, just as with a single orbit.
<br>
<p>However given two orbits that intersect at relatively small angles, it
<br>
is not too difficult to position additional orbits that also intersect
<br>
at small angles (using a different intersection point, otherwise we've
<br>
got the polar orbits from above).  We can't have the angles be *too*
<br>
small because then we can't fit additional orbits which cross the one
<br>
and then the other at the right points.  The orbits have to separate by
<br>
enough that additional orbits can be added and fit into the gaps.
<br>
<p>I haven't tried to work out the geometry in detail but it looks like it
<br>
is probably possible to get at least &quot;several&quot; such orbits into place
<br>
still crossing at angles less than 30 degrees or so.  I doubt that you
<br>
can have dozens of them, though.  Each orbit crosses every other orbit
<br>
and the angles are going to add up.  But overall, this seems like the
<br>
most promising approach.
<br>
<p>Sorry, I have no idea whether or where this problem might be more
<br>
formally studied.
