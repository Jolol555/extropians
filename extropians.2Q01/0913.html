<br>
<p>Damien, I can't tell if how much of your following discussion was
<br>
intended to be humorous or discussion material [I think my humor
<br>
detection meter is dead today...] -- so I'll simply explain the
<br>
reasoning.
<br>
<p>You are getting to a large degree into whether species move
<br>
towards K-strategy or R-strategy (which I'm too lazy to
<br>
go lookup now to define { I must be catching the Spike Virus }).
<br>
<p>Here is how it works though.
<br>
<p>For longevity:
<br>
&nbsp;(a) &quot;Big&quot; is better;
<br>
&nbsp;(b) &quot;special defenses&quot; is better;
<br>
&nbsp;(c) &quot;intelligence&quot; is better
<br>
E.g.:
<br>
&nbsp;(a) Elephants, whales, sturgeon; giant clams; parrots;
<br>
&nbsp;(b) tortises, giant clams, lobsters, all birds &amp; bats (mobility);
<br>
&nbsp;(c) Elephants, chimpanzees (&amp; other great apes), parrots, man.
<br>
<p>Why are these better?  Because they provide you with ways to
<br>
&quot;beat&quot; the hazard function.  What determines the 'hazard function'?
<br>
<p>If you are &quot;small&quot; you are generally prey and die from predation.
<br>
(your gene strategy becomes -- live fast, die young and leave
<br>
lots of children -- which I think may be the R-strategy.)
<br>
<p>If you've managed to get yourself into one of the 'special'
<br>
categories listed above, evolution (generally) moves you in
<br>
the other direction (K-strategy?) where you have fewer young
<br>
over a much longer reproductive period (which is what I think
<br>
you suggested in your note).
<br>
<p>*But* the bigger you are the greater your nutritional requirements
<br>
are and the greater risk you have of starving during environmental
<br>
disruptions or simply &quot;overpopulation&quot; of the local carrying capacity.
<br>
(Remember that starvation weakens the immune system giving
<br>
microorganisms a chance to develop into overwhelming numbers in
<br>
you and potentially migrate to other members of your species).
<br>
<p>You may have &quot;defenses&quot; but your extended longevity gives microorganisms
<br>
all that much more time to figure out their weaknesses.  If your
<br>
defenses reduce your mobility, then you fall victum to &quot;local&quot; hazards.
<br>
Tortises don't &quot;relocate&quot; from the Galapagos to Hawaii when the
<br>
local food resources go sour due to an El Nino.
<br>
<p>Intelligence works fairly well.  Human propagation shows it beats
<br>
all other hands.  But even that trait runs up against limits of endless
<br>
reproduction running head first into the carrying capacity of the
<br>
environment (e.g. global warming).
<br>
<p>My take on &quot;the declining force of natural selection&quot; is that
<br>
evolution hasn't had enough substrate on which to evolve a
<br>
&quot;perfect&quot; program.  [If you think it can roll the perfect program
<br>
out of the starting gate then you need a much better understanding
<br>
of biochemistry and physiology -- start with Jay Olshansky's recent
<br>
article in Scientific American about how humans &quot;should&quot; be designed
<br>
if were were engineered for longevity.]
<br>
<p>A simple example would be the &quot;SOS&quot;-program built into bacteria.
<br>
It gets activated when nothing else is working and bacteria are dropping
<br>
like flies and the only way out of a dead-end in your &quot;local&quot; environment
<br>
is to produce an entirely new genetic program.  Its evolution's way of
<br>
saying you have to kill any other passengers to save your children.
<br>
Unfortunately only bacteria have a &quot;real&quot; &quot;SOS&quot;-program.
<br>
<p>You &quot;can&quot; produce progams that survive the extinction events but
<br>
only at a cost of becoming something completely different.
<br>
<p>If you look at the multi-parameter optimization vector, you can
<br>
see how difficult the problem is --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) get big -- but don't exceed the carrying capacity of the environment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) get great defenses (e.g. armour) -- but remain mobile
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) get mobile -- but sacrifice the armoured defenses
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) get intelligent -- again this requires a large fraction of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources (15-20% of overall body energy consumption) to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support advanced intelligences.  (Such resources will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in short supply during famine periods).  Also have children
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that require lengthy gestation and education periods (during
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which they are incapable of protecting themselves).
<br>
<p>Nature does &quot;push&quot; on these vectors.  But as the dinosaurs show,
<br>
you can get very big and when your food supply goes belly-up
<br>
so do you.
<br>
<p>The 'declining force of natural selection' is just a way of saying
<br>
that as one grows older there is very little left in the gene pool
<br>
(due to predation and accidents) in terms of &quot;longevity genes&quot; which
<br>
Nature can select from.
<br>
<p>It gets worse due to the &quot;reproduction runaway&quot; problem.  Individuals
<br>
who have won the genetic lottery and who devote their resources more
<br>
to maintenance and repair rather than reproduction get competed out
<br>
of the gene pool!  Why?  Well if you have a generation time of 20
<br>
years (# offspring = replacement levels) and your rabbit-copying
<br>
cousins have a generation time of 10 years (you have to devote your
<br>
resources to maintenance and repair while they devote them to mating,
<br>
producing and feeding offspring); then after 100 years your &quot;long-lived&quot;
<br>
clad has 2^5 people while the short-livers have 2^10 people.  You will
<br>
note that 2^10 people are much more able to harvest the available
<br>
resources than 2^5 people.  Furthermore your clad has a problem finding
<br>
mates who can compete against the short-livers clad for resources
<br>
and has a problem of in-breeding producing non-productive lethals
<br>
amongst the long-livers.  [You will note I am sure that Heinlein
<br>
&quot;stacked&quot; the deck by providing an un-natural reward for people
<br>
to marry within the long-lived clad.]
<br>
<p>Now, there is a way out of this problem -- you have to become
<br>
more fecund with age!  [i.e. as you get older you have to
<br>
increase your reproductive output so to maintain the fraction
<br>
of longevity determinant genes in the overall gene pool].
<br>
This is precisely the strategy followed by many trees (more
<br>
seeds as the get larger and older), sturgeon and perhaps
<br>
lobsters and giant clams.  However note the problem -- to
<br>
produce more offspring to maintain your fraction of the gene
<br>
pool you have to get larger (or at least harvest and recycle
<br>
an increasingly larger fraction of your local resources) --
<br>
once again you are up against the &quot;getting big&quot; solution to
<br>
longevity -- eventually you hit the carrying capacity of
<br>
the environment.
<br>
<p>In other words even if you are big, with great defenses,
<br>
and are very intelligent and win the genetic longevity
<br>
lottery you will lose the genetic reproductive lottery
<br>
because sooner or later your environment will not support
<br>
the fecundity you need to retain your &quot;share&quot; in the
<br>
species gene pool.
<br>
<p>The above hopefully provides clear explanations as to
<br>
why organisms age as you will probably hear from anyone
<br>
alive today.  { If it isn't clear hit me and I'll try to
<br>
explain the details further. }
