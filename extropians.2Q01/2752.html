<p>Uh, some of us gray-hairs who have been hacking since before the
<br>
beginning of internet time often do not have degrees or certainly not
<br>
degrees equal to the types of projects we design and build.  At one time
<br>
I took all the tech courses I needed for the first piece of paper, but
<br>
they insisted I needed a lot of off-subject &quot;rounding&quot; BS I had no time
<br>
for and less interest in.  Hell, I didn't go to college until I was 25
<br>
and already had dependents to support.  I was as &quot;well rounded&quot; as I was
<br>
ever going to be.  So I simply went to work and started designing and
<br>
building things that the academics might talk about (but only build toy
<br>
versions of, if that) but that working programmers were amazed to see
<br>
actually implemented and running.  Over the years of course I have kept
<br>
up my education in my field and outside of it,  better than many PhD CS
<br>
folks I know.  
<br>
<p>A degree is a piece of paper.  You need people with well tuned brains, a
<br>
passion for the work and enough practical experience to avoid the
<br>
pitfalls they and others have already experienced.  I don't work for
<br>
places or people too stupid to understand that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think this sounds like Eliezer, because he doesn't want get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree in the area he's pursuing, creating an artificial intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, he doesn't seem to think much of neuroscience, at least judging from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his post history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you can read, understand and work with the concepts of a branch or
<br>
multiple branches of learning then precisely why is it worthwhile to
<br>
spend N years getting a degree in them?  There are many, many PhD'ed
<br>
people out there who do not deserve more consideration just for that and
<br>
who do not receive more consideration because of it. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is not a good idea to start your carreer by deliberately narrowing down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your choices. Getting a Ph.D. by the time you're 25 is very possible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hardworking person of a larger than average intelligence working in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right place, and opens a lot of doors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, in normal times. If you want to go to normal R&amp;D jobs in
<br>
someone else's lab or get an academic post with enough funding.   But if
<br>
you are on fire to create then I would not automatically recommend it. 
<br>
Not even to those half my age.
