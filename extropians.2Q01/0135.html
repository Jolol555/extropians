<p>What Im trying to tap into here Steve is the strongest motivating
<br>
force known: self interest.  Way stronger than basic human goodness
<br>
or charity, likely always will be.  Im looking to incentivize the medical
<br>
community in a special way.
<br>
<p>I had a long talk with a couple friends last night, husband is an
<br>
emergency room doctor, wife is an emergency room nurse.  We
<br>
discussed cryonics, organ donations, etc, and I came away with
<br>
the notion that one of the biggest challenges facing the cryonaut
<br>
is the fact that the overwhelming majority of the personnel most
<br>
likely to handle my cooling corpse either do not believe in cryonics
<br>
or oppose it philosophically.
<br>
<p>Altho I dont know for sure, I would think that time is critical
<br>
after one perishes: it is better to get frozen quickly.  The parameds
<br>
who arrive on the scene, find the body,  attempt a for-show
<br>
resuscitation for the sake of the family, perhaps causing more
<br>
damage than benefit, etc.  They get the message that oh, sure,
<br>
another self deluded freezer geezer (term borrowed from
<br>
Damien Broderick), then half heartedly carry out the drill, all
<br>
along thinking about which hotdog stand will provide lunch.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, compare to an alternate scenario, whereby one
<br>
incentivizes the parameds to hustle their arses, with a reward
<br>
for haste and completeness and correctness in carrying out their
<br>
task.  With a mere few thousand bucks reward available to the
<br>
otherwise lackadaisical personnel, the attitude would then be:
<br>
EMERGENCY!!  FREEZER GEEZER with MONEY!
<br>
Drop everything, get with the program!
<br>
<p>My admittedly cynical theory is that the motivating force of
<br>
ethical duty is weak indeed compared to the promise of
<br>
scoring an occasional few thousand bucks for doing the right
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, consider this scenario, also borrowed from
<br>
one of Damien's books, Hells Teeth.  I perish unexpectedly,
<br>
my bewildered spouse is left frantically trying to get the
<br>
parameds to speed my remains to the cryonics facility, on
<br>
top of having to deal with the emotional shock of my
<br>
untimely demise.  They being nonbelievers, fail to respond
<br>
appropriately and add still more trauma to an already trying
<br>
and unfortunate sitch.  This is cruel and needless pain
<br>
inflicted upon the family, worse than the Robert Reuben
<br>
game I was indulging in last week.
<br>
<p>If on the other hand, I had some device that communicated
<br>
the complete cryo-instructions to parameds, along with the
<br>
available monetary rewards to the participants, while they
<br>
were in route to my mortal remains, well then my spouse
<br>
would be spared.  Being as how she will likely already
<br>
be having a really bad day, this desire to not make it any
<br>
worse than necessary compels me more than even
<br>
the tenuous hope of techno-resurrection.
<br>
<p>I recognize the ethical dilemmas this whole notion would
<br>
present, such as ambulances shrieking past the gravely
<br>
injured and scooping up the wealthy corpses, but perhaps
<br>
there is a solution among the problems.
<br>
<p>Someone who hangs out on cryonet, feel free to
<br>
crosspost this message to there, as this topic has likely
<br>
already been hashed out.  spike
