<p><em>&gt; Say I'm slopping together some biochemicals and produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something the intellectual equivalent of a fish. Or I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write an AI in perl that's not quite up to normal human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence--ok, it's an idiot--but it's self aware. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what point on the continuum do we declare such a man made
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>We do not disagree, and sorry for the confusion.  You own
<br>
these resources, and in your opinion and mine, the issue
<br>
of citizenship does not arise (except within your creation)
<br>
and you ought to be free to do what you want.
<br>
<p>But your original post could be interpreted by many as
<br>
implying that our own citizens who are not up to snuff
<br>
don't have rights.  More philosophically, an entity at
<br>
one level should regard other entities at his or her
<br>
level as citizens, i.e. having rights, only if you and
<br>
he or she are members of a pre-existing society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In what pre-existing social arrangement are these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example beings I've created? Spell it out for me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm simpleminded.
</em><br>
<p>As is so often the case, no one is being silly or simpleminded,
<br>
there has simply been a &quot;failure to communicate&quot; :-)
<br>
<p>Repeating what I said earlier, others are invited to try to
<br>
persuade you and me to grant a sort of &quot;subsidiary rights&quot;
<br>
to our creations, but, say, the creatures inhabiting my
<br>
piece of computronium don't have any rights from my perspective,
<br>
and obtain &quot;rights&quot; only when I grant them or the societies
<br>
that evolve there grant them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What are their rights, in your opinion?
</em><br>
<p>In every case I know of, consideration of &quot;rights&quot; (except
<br>
for the technical term &quot;legal rights&quot;) leads to disasterous
<br>
confusion and miscommunication.  The term is usually employed
<br>
in a disingenous way by people who really believe &quot;I approve
<br>
of X being able to do Y&quot; but who find for rhetorical reasons
<br>
that it is more effective to claim that &quot;X has the right to do Y&quot;.
