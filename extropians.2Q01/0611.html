<p>This points to a problem with the idea of a simulation that covers only
<br>
a limited period of time: how to initialize the characters who must
<br>
inevitably be partway through their lives at the time the simulation
<br>
begins.  This is especially difficult if the characters are not zombies.
<br>
<p>The fundamental paradox is that if the Simulators are not able to know
<br>
how humans will behave without running the simulation, then they will
<br>
not be able to come up with realistic memories and histories for adults
<br>
at the start of the simulation.  Or, putting it the other way, if they
<br>
are able to tell what people will be like and what they will do without
<br>
running a simulation, then they don't need to run any simulations.
