<p>Eh? Mr. Tynes, I haven't stopped beating my wife, but I'm not married. 
<br>
<p>Initially, _I_ have not talked about doing assembly in orbit. _I_ have
<br>
been talking about design-ahead of useful snap-together subsystems for
<br>
micro or nanosats, using foreseeable stuff. 
<br>
<p>Accretion of these in orbit is not my short term concern in this thread.
<br>
Feel free to solve the problems you mention. I'd like that.

<p><em>&gt; Vacuum can be replicated; zero-g can't (for indefinite amounts of time,

</em><br>
<p>I'm sure it can. Off the top of my head, I can think of some things. I
<br>
never said I have all the answers, but there are people still alive who
<br>
probably could help.
<br>
<p>I get the impression you think I think that everything will work
<br>
perfectly with no need for space systems engineering review by people
<br>
who have actually &quot;seen the elephant&quot;. Or that you think I think we can
<br>
cook up some system on the back of an envelope and launch a zillion in
<br>
short order.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't think that. And I don't expect everything to be bug free in
<br>
version 1.0. And I don't have all the answers. But there's (for
<br>
instance) a propulsion weenie on this list, and I'd trust him to not
<br>
fsck up that part too badly. :)
<br>
<p>Cordially,
<br>
<p>Mike
