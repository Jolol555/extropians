<em>&gt; I AM worried about the starving people in the Sudan.  And repression in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China.  And child abuse and urban poverty in the US.  And the work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment that slowly sucks the life force out of the middle class.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone who isn't as smart or as famous or as important as they want to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't inherit a family business in AI.  I didn't fall into this because
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I understand that and deeply admire and applaud it.  It would help
<br>
if that purpose was more visible to world in general.  It might also
<br>
help if
<br>
some of us have a story for the interim between now and the creation of
<br>
a friendly SI.  If that story is &quot;suffer it to be so for a little while
<br>
longer&quot; then so be it.  But I think it is important to know what the
<br>
story is and why.  It is important both for mass consumption and for the
<br>
peace of mind and vision of those doing the work.
