</em><br>
<p>That probably sounds good in Sweden, where you don't have the level of
<br>
diversity found in North America. However, pluralism and politically correct
<br>
tolerance has resulted in an unexpected consequence in that this position has
<br>
no tolerance for advocates of unification and objective morality. The irony is
<br>
wasted, for the most part, on people who are enamored of the entertaining
<br>
spectacle that multi-ethics produces. (Did you hear about the Easter week end
<br>
riots in Cincinnati?) Since all ethical systems can't be right (they
<br>
contradict each other too much), we might note that they *can* all be wrong.
<br>
The objection to drug use derives from Puritan and anti-hedonism memes, as you
<br>
point out, and in addition there is the argument that drugs make one dependent
<br>
and therefore not at liberty to experience cognitive delights without this
<br>
chemical crutch. To which I'd reply, those who need (or want) crutches ought
<br>
to have them. Until Samantha becomes super-bodhisattva, we'll just have to
<br>
make do with neuroscience applied technologies that include self-medication
<br>
(or recreation, as the case may be).
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
