<p>Anders, you have to be careful with this approach.  If the asteroid has
<br>
a moderately high density there isn't going to be enough water there
<br>
to make a cup of coffee.  If you want water you are going to have to
<br>
get comets, preferably before they have evaporated all the lighter
<br>
materials.  Its going to be an interesting end-game -- if you want
<br>
construction materials you go to the asteroids, but if you want standard
<br>
rocket fuel you go to the comets.
