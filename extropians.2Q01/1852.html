Greg Burch forwarded the very nice article on Chaitin's Omega 
<br>
on Sun Apr 1, 2001, 9:31 am.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chaitin formulated a Diophantine equation that was 200 pages 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long and had 17,000 variables. Given an equation like this, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematicians would normally search for its solutions.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, right. I can just see them sitting down to work on it.
<br>
<p>(I presume that their whiteboards aren't big enough. :-)
<br>
<p>But maybe I'm just projecting my own feelings of inadequacy and 
<br>
incompetence: I can't solve either of the simple Diophantine 
<br>
equations &quot;ab - cd = 1&quot; or &quot;a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + 1&quot;. I worry 
<br>
that the first may not even be possible---that is, are there 
<br>
four functions a=a(n,m,...), b=b(n,m,...), c=c(n,m,...), 
<br>
d=d(n,m,...) that yield all the pairs of factors whose 
<br>
difference is 1?  (If you know the solution to either 
<br>
of these, please, let me know!)
<br>
<p>Samantha the Skeptic wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the face of it I would be surprised if you could rigorously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show the existence of such a (Chaitin's Omega) beast without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it somewhat calculable. It looks like a philosophical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought experiment run amok. 
</em><br>
<p>As I understand it, it's pretty easy to see that it exists 
<br>
(especially if you are a mathematical Platonist). The nth 
<br>
bit of Omega is precisely whether the nth Turing machine 
<br>
halts (given any concrete scheme at all for enumerating 
<br>
Turing machines). It's clearly not calculable since you 
<br>
can't know for many bits whether they are one or zero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, no Godel didn't do any such thing (&quot;blew a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gaping hope in mathematics&quot;) or at least not with what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are popularly thought to be the implications
</em><br>
<p>The formalists were pretty upset; and, although I don't 
<br>
really like the metaphor, the image that does come to 
<br>
mind that fits the metaphor is The List of All True Math 
<br>
Relationships (listed in the appendix of God's Book, 
<br>
according to Paul Eotvos--- 'scuse the spelling, it's 
<br>
pronounced Ehrdish).... anyway, The List has lots of 
<br>
Relationships that can't properly be called Theorems 
<br>
because they don't have proofs. Each such unprovable 
<br>
theorem WOULD indeed look like a gaping hole to a 
<br>
formalist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, so you can build a mapping. But it is another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to say that mapping implies things true in one 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; domain are true in the other without more evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than just such a mapping. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure that they prove iso- or homo- or something- 
<br>
morphism. But I agree with you that some of the 
<br>
claims in the science article were hyped, and thanks 
<br>
for reminding people like me to approach even things 
<br>
others know a lot better with a bit of skepticism.
<br>
<p>And Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Except for the idea that the Goldbach Conjecture 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (NOT the Riemann Hypothesis, as stated in the article) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be true but TOTALLY unproveable (i.e., the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence of an infinite number of independent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical facts). I've heard this hypothesized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before in connection with Chaitin's work, and I find it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both plausible and chilling.
</em><br>
<p>Well, no more than Godel's Theorem is chilling. Right?
<br>
But what's the difference between the GC and the RH that 
<br>
you allude to? Mightn't it be true, i.e., actually 
<br>
the case, that either one is true but unprovable?
<br>
<p>Here is a puzzle that I formulated on this subject that's fun. 
<br>
A great mathematician is at a party, and two students come 
<br>
up to him. One says, &quot;I have found a proof that Goldbach's 
<br>
Conjecture is unprovable!&quot;. The mathematician snorts, &quot;Go 
<br>
away, you crackpot&quot;. Then the other student says, &quot;I have 
<br>
found a proof that whether or not there exist infinitely 
<br>
many prime pairs is unprovable!&quot;, and the mathematician's
<br>
eyes light up and he says &quot;Oh, really!? Please tell me
<br>
more!&quot;.  Why was the mathematician eager to hear out the
<br>
second student, but not the first?
