<p>
When I was a junior in one of the two high schools of
<br>
the public school system in Newark, Delaware, back in
<br>
1969, I somehow found myself being handed the opportunity to
<br>
attend an expense-paid summer session at Archmere Academy,
<br>
a private school just north of Wilmington.  I no longer remember
<br>
the details of how this came about (ungrateful wretch that
<br>
I am), except that it must have been through the kind
<br>
attention of one of my teachers, since I have never been
<br>
either alert or hungry enough to seek out such chances
<br>
on my own (and I probably had to be hit over the head
<br>
once or twice to be persuaded to take advantage of this
<br>
one).  Nevertheless, that summer has remained in my
<br>
memory as a taste of what school can be like in circumstances
<br>
where both students and teachers are enthusiastic about
<br>
the educational process, and where the subject matter is
<br>
not limited by the bland requirements of the public-school
<br>
curriculum.
<br>
<p>One lasting gift I received during that brief exposure to the
<br>
delights of high-quality private education was an acquaintance
<br>
with Bertrand Russell.  The book we read was one of his
<br>
lighter, popular ones, _The Conquest of Happiness_
<br>
( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871401622">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871401622</a> ), but
<br>
it engendered a permanent appreciation for the characteristic
<br>
scathing humor arising from the combination of Russell's
<br>
razor intelligence and breadth of knowledge with his cleverness
<br>
in crafting dryly witty prose.  A few years later, after hearing
<br>
a recording in the audio holdings of the University of Delaware's
<br>
Morris Library, I left work early one afternoon and drove to
<br>
Philadelphia to purchase an LP called &quot;Bertrand Russell Speaking&quot;
<br>
(Caedmon TC-1148), containing 52 minutes of Woodrow Wyatt interviews
<br>
from 1959 (also published as _Bertrand Russell Speaks His Mind_)
<br>
on the topics of &quot;Philosophy and Science&quot;, &quot;The Importance of
<br>
Religion&quot;, &quot;Taboo Morality&quot;, and &quot;Fanaticism&quot;.
<br>
<p>Russell has published whole books on the subject of science and
<br>
religion (or, to be less coy, on the subject of science
<br>
**versus** religion:  for example, _Religion and Science_
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195115511">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195115511</a>
<br>
and _Why I Am Not a Christian_
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671203231">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671203231</a>
<br>
which I have certainly read, in addition to his books about
<br>
morality, politics, and the history of philosophy, over
<br>
the intervening years.  But I often listen to the CD-R copy I
<br>
have made of that old LP just to be able to enjoy the sound
<br>
of Russell's voice, which brings the characteristic wit and
<br>
humor already apparent on the printed page to vivid life (and
<br>
gives a glimmer of what an immensely entertaining raconteur
<br>
the man must have been).
<br>
<p>Russell wrote an autobiography
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/041522862X">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/041522862X</a>
<br>
and there is a fascinating book called _My Father,
<br>
Bertrand Russell_ by his daughter Katharine Russell Tait
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1855063905">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1855063905</a> .
<br>
I have also browsed in the first of the two-volume
<br>
biography by Ray Monk:
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684828022">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684828022</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743212150">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743212150</a>
<br>
The Bertrand Russell Society
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/4268/">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/4268/</a>
<br>
has an archive of sound recordings of Russell, from which
<br>
three (all-too-brief) Real Audio sound clips are available
<br>
on-line (two from Russell's Nobel Prize acceptance speech,
<br>
and one from a discussion called &quot;Leonardo's Day And Our
<br>
Own&quot;): <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/4268/tapes4.html">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/4268/tapes4.html</a> .
<br>
<p>My admiration of Russell is certainly not unalloyed.
<br>
For one thing, in the course of too steady a diet of
<br>
Russell, the crackling wit takes on a shrill and edgy
<br>
tone.  Also, one gathers from the bio and from his
<br>
daughter's book that he could be cruel to the people
<br>
around him, if only unintentionally.  He was above all
<br>
a man of thought, and people like that can sometimes force
<br>
those around them to fit the categories and theories
<br>
they have devised, and blind themselves to the suffering
<br>
they cause thereby.
<br>
<p>The old LP I bought in the early 70's was apparently available
<br>
as an audio cassette as recently as the mid-80's
<br>
( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D9996606295">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D9996606295</a> )
<br>
but is probably currently out of print.  I have succumbed
<br>
to the temptation to transcribe the section &quot;The Importance
<br>
of Religion&quot; and include it here, for the pure joy
<br>
of sharing a bit of something that has given me so much
<br>
(wicked) pleasure.
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Have you ever had religious impulses, Lord Russell?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Oh, yes!  When I was adolescent, I was **deeply**
<br>
religious.  I was more interested in religion than in
<br>
anything else except, perhaps, mathematics.  And, uh,
<br>
being interested in religion led me -- which it doesn't
<br>
seem often to do! -- to look into the question whether
<br>
there was reason to believe it.  I took up three questions.
<br>
It seemed to me that God, and immortality, and free will
<br>
were the three most essential questions.  And I examined
<br>
these one by one, in the reverse order, beginning with
<br>
free will.  And, uh, gradually, I came to the conclusion
<br>
that there was **no** reason to believe **any** of these.
<br>
And, uh, after that, I thought I was going to be very
<br>
disappointed, but oddly enough I wasn't.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  But how did you come to convince yourself there's
<br>
no reason to believe in any of these three things?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Well, uh, over free will I think the argument
<br>
was, uh, not a valid one, and I don't, any longer,
<br>
think it was still conclusive, but I thought that because
<br>
I thought that all the motions of matter are determined
<br>
by the laws of dynamics, and the motion of a man's
<br>
lips when he speaks must be so determined, so that he
<br>
can have no control over what he's going to say.  Tha...
<br>
I don't think that was a valid argument, but that convinced
<br>
me at that **time**.  About immortality, well, it seemed
<br>
to me quite clear that, uh, the relation of body and
<br>
mind, whatever it may be, is much more **intimate** than
<br>
is commonly supposed, and uh, that there's **no**
<br>
reason to think that a mind persists when a brain decays.
<br>
And as for God...  well, there are a great many
<br>
arguments that have been advanced in favor of the
<br>
existence of God.  And, one and all, I thought,
<br>
and **still** think, that they're invalid, and that
<br>
nobody would've accepted such arguments if they hadn't
<br>
wanted to believe the conclusion.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Do you think that it is **certain** that there is
<br>
no such thing as God, or simply that it is not proven?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  I don't think it is **certain** that there is
<br>
no such thing, no.  I think, uh, that it is on exactly the
<br>
same level as the Olympic gods or the Norwegian gods.
<br>
They also **may** exist -- the gods of Olympus and the gods
<br>
of Valhalla.  I can't prove they **don't**.  But I think
<br>
the Christian god has no **more** likelihood than they
<br>
have.  I think they're a **bare** possibility!
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Do you think that religion is good or harmful
<br>
in its effects?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  I think most of its effects in history have
<br>
been harmful.  Not all.  Religion caused the
<br>
Egyptian priests to fix the calendar, and to note the
<br>
occurrence of eclipses so well that in time
<br>
they were able to predict them.  I think those were
<br>
beneficial effects of religion.  But I think a
<br>
**great** majority have been bad.  And I think they've
<br>
been bad because it was held important that people
<br>
should believe something for which there did not exist
<br>
good evidence.  And that falsified everybody's thinking,
<br>
falsified systems of education, and set up also what
<br>
I think a complete moral heresy:  namely, that it is
<br>
**right** to believe certain things, and **wrong**
<br>
to believe certain others, apart from the question
<br>
whether the things in question are true or false.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  But do you mean there's a kind of censorship
<br>
of thought that goes on, which prevents freethinking?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  I do, yes.  I mean, uh, if you take
<br>
practically any school in the world -- any school for
<br>
boys and girls -- you will find that a certain kind
<br>
of belief is taught.  It's one sort in Christian
<br>
countries and another in Communist countries.  But
<br>
in both, something is **taught**, and the **evidence**
<br>
for what is taught is not impartially examined.  And
<br>
the children are not encouraged to find out what there
<br>
is to say on the other side.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  What is it that makes Man, over the centuries,
<br>
demand a religion?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  I think **mainly** fear.  Man feels himself
<br>
rather powerless...  There are three things that cause
<br>
him fear.  One is what Nature can do to him -- it can
<br>
strike him by lightning or swallow him up in an
<br>
earthquake.  One is what other men can do, which is
<br>
that they can kill him in war.  And the third, which has
<br>
a great deal to do with religion, is what his own
<br>
violent passions may lead him to do.  Things which he
<br>
knows, in a calm moment, he would regret having done.
<br>
And for that reason, most people have a great deal of
<br>
**fear** in their lives.  And, uh, religion... helps
<br>
them to be not so frightened by these fears.  But the
<br>
founders of religions -- I say **religions** in the
<br>
plural -- have very little to do with what their
<br>
followers teach.  Very little indeed.  I, uh, 
<br>
well, now, to take an illustration... I've found that,
<br>
uh, military men in this country think that, uh,
<br>
Christian belief is very important in the contest with
<br>
Eastern powers.  And, uh, they think that if you're
<br>
not a Christian you won't be so vigorous about it.
<br>
Well, uh, I read the Sermon on the Mount over again
<br>
and I couldn't find a **word** in it to encourage
<br>
H-bombs, not a **word**!
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Much of what you're criticizing happened a
<br>
long time ago, but what about today?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Oh, no, it's just the same today.  Ah, this
<br>
illustration I gave you about the H-bombs is certainly
<br>
not antiquated yet.  I wish it **were**!  And I think
<br>
that at this present day, uh, religion -- as embodied
<br>
in the churches -- in the main, discourages honest
<br>
thinking, and gives importance to things that
<br>
are **not** very important.  Its sense of importance
<br>
seems to me quite wrong.  Now, when the Roman Empire
<br>
was falling, the Fathers of the Church didn't bother
<br>
much with the fall of the Roman Empire.  What they
<br>
bothered with was how to preserve virginity -- that
<br>
was what they thought important.  Well now, when...
<br>
<p>WYATT:  What did they do about that, sir?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Well, they exhorted people.  And, uh, didn't
<br>
bother about seeing that the armies held the frontiers
<br>
or anything like that, or that the taxation system
<br>
was reformed.  They were occupied in founding monasteries
<br>
and nunneries and so forth, and thought that far
<br>
more important than preserving the Empire.  Well, so, in
<br>
the present day, when the human race is falling, I find
<br>
that, uh, eminent divines think that it's much more
<br>
important to prevent artificial insemination than it is
<br>
to prevent the kind of world war that will exterminate
<br>
the whole lot of us.  And that seems to me to show
<br>
a lack of sense of proportion.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Yes, but wouldn't you agree, though, that many
<br>
organized religions have done a tremendous amount of
<br>
good in spreading education where perhaps no other
<br>
system has been available -- as in Burma, say, where the
<br>
monks have done a tremendous amount of educating the
<br>
poor where there aren't any organized schools?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Well, I think it's possible, yes, and I, I think
<br>
the Benedictines did a certain amount of good in that
<br>
way.  But only **after** doing the harm.  They first
<br>
did a great deal of harm, and then a little good!
<br>
<p>WYATT:  But, though...  What about people, though, who
<br>
feel that they must have some faith in a religion,
<br>
otherwise they can't face their life at all...
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Well, I say that...
<br>
<p>WYATT:  ...if you take that away?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  I say people who feel that are, really...
<br>
Well, they're showing a kind of cowardice which in any
<br>
other sphere would be considered **contemptible**, but
<br>
when it's in the religious sphere it's thought
<br>
admirable.  And I can't admire cowardice, whatever
<br>
sphere it's in.  Now take, uh, the whole question
<br>
of the very dangerous condition that the world is
<br>
in.  I get letters **constantly** from people
<br>
saying, &quot;Oh, God will look after it.&quot;  But he never
<br>
has in the past!  I don't know why they should think
<br>
he will in the future.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  You mean you think this is a very unwise
<br>
doctrine to follow -- it ought to be self-help
<br>
rather than depending on somebody else to do it
<br>
for you?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Certainly, yes!
<br>
<p>WYATT:  But then if, though, religion is harmful,
<br>
and yet Man has always insisted on having one,
<br>
what is the answer?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Oh, &quot;Man&quot; hasn't.  **Some** men have,
<br>
and those are the men who are used to it.  In countries
<br>
in the Laand, for instance, people walk on stilts.
<br>
And they don't like walking without stilts.  And
<br>
religion is just the same thing -- some countries
<br>
have got accustomed to it.  But, uh, now, I spent a
<br>
year in China, and I found that the ordinary,
<br>
average Chinese had no religion whatsoever.  And,
<br>
they were just as happy -- I think, given their
<br>
bad circumstance, happier -- than most Christians
<br>
would have been.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  But I think a Christian would say that if
<br>
he could convert them into being Christians, they'd
<br>
be much happier.
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Well, I don't think that's borne out by
<br>
the evidence at all.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Yes, but, though...  doesn't Man rather
<br>
search for some cause or faith outside himself,
<br>
which appears to be bigger than himself -- not
<br>
merely a question of cowardice or leaning on it,
<br>
but also wanting to do something for it?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Well, but there are plenty of things bigger
<br>
than oneself.  Um, I mean, uh, from... you start... 
<br>
first of all there's your family, then there's your
<br>
nation, then there's mankind in general.  Those are
<br>
all bigger than oneself, and are quite sufficient to
<br>
occupy any genuine feelings of benevolence that a
<br>
man may have.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Do you think that organized religion's going
<br>
to go on having the same grip on mankind?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  I think it depends entirely upon whether
<br>
people solve their social problems or not.  I think
<br>
that, uh, if there go on being great wars and great
<br>
oppressions, and many people leading very unhappy
<br>
lives, probably religion **will** go on, because I've
<br>
observed that the belief in the goodness of God is
<br>
inversely proportional to the evidence.  When there's
<br>
no evidence for it at all, people believe it; and
<br>
when things are going well and you might believe it,
<br>
they **don't**.  So I think that if people solve
<br>
their social problems, religion will die out.  But,
<br>
on the other hand, if they don't, I don't think it
<br>
will.  Now you can get illustrations for that in the
<br>
past.  In the eighteenth century, when things were
<br>
quiet, a great many educated people were
<br>
freethinkers.  Well, then came the French Revolution,
<br>
and certainly English aristocrats came to the
<br>
conclusion that free thought led to the guillotine,
<br>
and so they dropped it and they all became deeply
<br>
religious, and you got Victorianism.  And the same
<br>
thing again happened with the Russian Revolution.
<br>
The Russian Revolution terrified people, and they
<br>
thought that unless they believed in God their property
<br>
would be confiscated.  And so they believed in him.
<br>
So that, I think you'll find that these social
<br>
upheavals are very good for religion.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  Do you think that you and I are going to be
<br>
just snuffed out completely when we die?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Certainly, yes, I don't see why... what...
<br>
I mean, I know that the body disintegrates, and I
<br>
think that there's no reason **whatever** to suppose
<br>
that the mind goes on when the body is disintegrated.
