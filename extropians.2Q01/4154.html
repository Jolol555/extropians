</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p>Next, I could argue that the term &quot;practical&quot; is misleading, too,
<br>
and has a long tradition of being used in fallacies. Its only relevant
<br>
meaning, relative to empirical rationalism (as opposed e.g. to
<br>
contructivism or irrationalism), is so tautologically good that it doesn't
<br>
need mentioning, except in debates about rationality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<p>Now that you made some clarifications, I think that your message
<br>
could have been phrased in a meaningful, positively informative way;
<br>
but you chose to make &quot;oversimplications&quot; (as you put it,
<br>
which is also an oversimplification of the process
<br>
that led to your statements having an obvious fallacious interpretation):
<br>
you chose to resort to forms of expression
<br>
that are loaded with meanings opposed to what you think
<br>
(as compared to what you later explained you meant or didn't mean),
<br>
and to use common language in areas where it specifically fails.
<br>
<p>I think putting conciseness before correction is just wrong,
<br>
All the more since your post wasn't concise.
<br>
I'll grant you that there is one metrics according to which
<br>
your means of expression might have looked like a win:
<br>
it might originally have took you less time to think about
<br>
and write your message in this incorrect form
<br>
than it would have in its correct form.
<br>
But as you can see, this time you thought you won,
<br>
was first lost by other people trying to decode what you say
<br>
or being misled by it (loss multiplied by the number of readers),
<br>
and then by yourself clarifying your position.
<br>
Either in a specifically altruistic point of view, or in a specifically
<br>
egoistic point of view, in all practicality, your choice was thus wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; So you think you're intelligent? prove it! I don't believe you, so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In intelligent discussion
</em><br>
This looks like one, after all. Thanks for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (as opposed to unprovoked attacks),
</em><br>
I don't think the attack was unprovoked.
<br>
And I don't think that attacks, even unprovoked,
<br>
oppose intelligent discussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...] this response would be referred to as ad hominem.
</em><br>
It was undeniably ad hominem, but note that it was not argumentum.
<br>
Thank you a lot for taking up the challenge
<br>
and making your post level higher.
<br>
*Now*, I believe you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's a weak strategy, is uncalled for in this case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and totally destroys your credibility.
</em><br>
I apparently participated in a working overall,
<br>
I don't think it was uncalled for,
<br>
and it's a risk I'm taking (though maybe lightly so).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps in the future you might consider taking a deep breath before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responding.
</em><br>
Thanks for reminding me. I'll try.
<br>
<p>I'll return the argument to you:
<br>
I should take time to be less aggressive in my replies,
<br>
you should take time to be more precise in yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's a difference between &quot;responsible for&quot; (in charge of,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is what I meant) and &quot;responsible to&quot; (an obligation).
</em><br>
I've never seen the term &quot;responsible to&quot;, so I'm not sure what you mean.
<br>
Can you expand?
<br>
Maybe you're trying to talk about intelligent handling of responsibility.
<br>
Which, in the context of justifying intelligent choice about the future,
<br>
is but a hidden tautology (which is, of course, true).
<br>
<p>Then to use your terms, I invite you to be &quot;responsible for&quot; your posts
<br>
and not just &quot;responsible to&quot; them. (Doesn't sound right.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see how it could be anything but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;natural&quot; for us to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Remove your quotes, and consider how &quot;do so&quot; is generic in your sentence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Then you'll have reached the tautology. Now, move on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This makes no sense to me. Again, I think you're arguing against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that isn't there.
</em><br>
Not all arguing is &quot;against&quot;. Don't let my questioning your own personal
<br>
intelligence let you polarize the debate in terms of &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot;.
<br>
I was putting your argument in perspective, and showing how
<br>
the specifics to which you apply them are irrelevant to its purpose,
<br>
thus factorizing your argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [I] was using [this phrase] in a conversational manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasn't trying to make any particular point.
</em><br>
Exactly what I'm reproaching you: noise.
<br>
<p>Now, I'll be putting this book in my long to-read list.
