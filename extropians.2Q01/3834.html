So maybe what we need to do is to start a Society, a Bayesian Society,
<br>
for people who understand the theorem about disagreements.  The founding
<br>
principle of the Society would be that you could not &quot;agree to disagree&quot;.
<br>
You can only either say that someone is lying about his sincere desire
<br>
to reach the truth, or else you must come to agreement.
<br>
<p>Assuming that claims of lying would be rare (hmmm, based on experience
<br>
here that may not be such a good assumption), the point of the Society
<br>
would be to reach agreement on all issues.  Disagreement would not
<br>
be tolerated.  When a member had new information he would bring it
<br>
to the attention of the Society and a new consensus would be reached.
<br>
All members would then be compelled to adopt that view.  (&quot;Compelled&quot;
<br>
by logic - as Lewis Carroll wrote, logic would take them by the throat
<br>
and FORCE them to agree.)
<br>
<p>It would be interesting to have a group where disagreements were
<br>
essentially forbidden.  Talk about groupthink!  Would it be a cult?
<br>
Would the members be brainwashed?  Or would this be the ultimate in
<br>
rationality?
<br>
<p>Being able to lie to others and to yourself on some things may be
<br>
important for success.  But there are times and issues where you do want
<br>
to know the truth.  A Society of this type could be helpful in providing
<br>
a source of truth, and for giving you mental practice in recognizing
<br>
when you are lying to yourself.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S. I see that there is already an International Society for Bayesian
<br>
Analysis.  Perhaps they would be good candidates for members in this
<br>
more exclusive club.
