<p>It isn't the error rate I'm harping about its the &quot;lost&quot; energy {=matter}.
<br>
<p>Spike and I have had this discussion off-list.  Theoretically at least,
<br>
if you send photons acros a large distance you can &quot;regenerate&quot; the
<br>
energy used to send them (the principle behind CCD's is that the
<br>
photons knock an electron into the conduction band and that electron
<br>
gets used to generate a &quot;charge&quot; that you could later use downstream.
<br>
Similarly, you accelerate a DTU (data transmission unit) up to 0.1c
<br>
in a mass driver, then decelerate it in a similar unit after it
<br>
travels N light years and you recapture the kinetic energy it contains
<br>
(at whatever your conversion efficiencies are).
<br>
<p>But both transmission strategies have losses -- the EM wave transmission
<br>
strategy loses photons unless you have a mirror large enough to capture
<br>
them all (and that has to be really big at 1 light year out...).  The
<br>
DTU loses mass to erosion by interstellar gas and dust.
<br>
<p>However the kicker is that you can control how much mass you lose in
<br>
the interstellar DTU by altering its velocity.  You can't control
<br>
the losses due to the spreading of your electromagnetic communication
<br>
beam because the dispersion is controlled by the laws of physics.
<br>
<p>In a fully developed solar system, you are short on both *energy*
<br>
and *matter* -- so if you are going to communicate or send probes
<br>
(or colonizing expediations), you better make sure you do it
<br>
as efficiently as possible and get back more than you have
<br>
invested.  Because of the inherent physical losses in EM waves
<br>
and their low information carrying capacity (relative to
<br>
a couple of kg of matter), DTU's seem to be highly preferred.
<br>
<p>The only exceptions would appear to be if you can think of
<br>
situations in which you can &quot;trade&quot; ~10^-20 to ~10^-30 of
<br>
the information you already have at your disposal over a link
<br>
that is relatively expensive and get &quot;perceived&quot; value from
<br>
that information that comes back that justifies the cost.  I haven't
<br>
done the translation into how many bits of &quot;new&quot; information
<br>
you can generate locally relative to what you can receive
<br>
from a remote exhange at a constant cost (in part this
<br>
depends on the &quot;novelty&quot; of the remotely generated vs.
<br>
the locally generated information and the distance over which
<br>
the local&lt;-&gt;remote exchange is occuring -- but I suspect the
<br>
remote information is going to have to be really novel
<br>
to justify the expense.
