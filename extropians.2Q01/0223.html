<p><em>&gt; &gt;      There was a question about how Islam (about 25% of the planet's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population) would respond to the types of technology we are interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's important to consider how Muslims respond to extropic technology,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 75% of the planet's population) would respond to extropic technology,
</em><br>
<p>Um, no.
<br>
<p>25% of the earth's population are Muslim. Another 15% or thereabouts
<br>
are Hindu. A whopping great 25% are Chinese. Between them, these three
<br>
groups amount to 65% of the planet's population -- nearly two-thirds. Yet
<br>
discussions of the intersection between extropian issues and religion
<br>
focusses almost entirely on Christian religionists (another 25-30% group).
<br>
<p>It seems to me that one of the consequences of a mature molecular
<br>
nanotechnology is that manufacturing technologies spread like
<br>
crazy: physical goods tend towards the state of software, with
<br>
non-informational replication costs directly proportional to mass,
<br>
mineralogical availability, and energy. This in turn suggests that a
<br>
working nanotechnology industrial base with replicators can very rapidly
<br>
raise the availability of material goods throughout the third world to
<br>
at least the level we in the developed world are accustomed to.
<br>
<p>Now, given that a lot of the political conflicts, famines, and other
<br>
unpleasantnesses we live with today are scarcity-related, doesn't it
<br>
make sense to try to understand how two thirds of the human species
<br>
will respond to technologies that promise to make most of the roots of
<br>
conflict magically go away?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; because there are three times more of them. Since this is the Extropy list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (not the Muslim theology list), it seems somewhat OT to discuss Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responses and/or theology. But since no one has complained...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslims, just like Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith-based creeds, have a small percentage of true believers, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest are content to identify themselves with their parents' denomination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and go about their business, not giving it much thought. 
</em><br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p>There's a complicating factor, though. Just as legislative infrastructure
<br>
in the west is dominated by Christian ideas of moral behaviour, so are
<br>
legislative systems in the non-Christian world dominated by other belief
<br>
systems. Even if the people living there don't actively believe, the way
<br>
their systems have developed have their roots in a religious culture.
<br>
Consider the strength of Sunday-opening laws for shops in various parts
<br>
of the west, or the way the institution of marriage is handled. Societies
<br>
with a western take on these may not be inhabited by fundamentalists, but
<br>
those laws were put into shape by a predominantly Christian-influenced
<br>
legislature at some time in the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Max's recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presentation at a Jewish school shows, normal, healthy kids don't let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious memes interfere with their perception of reality at large. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine that most of these kids are smart enough to ask questions like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following.
</em><br>
<p>(Snipped -- parody piece off usenet.) 
<br>
<p>What you just quoted was a bunch of questions intended to mock biblical
<br>
literalists. The fact that you can post such questions means that your
<br>
society isn't dominated by such people.
<br>
<p>It's worth noting that in the Islamic world, there is a small but vocal
<br>
minority who, if you posted equivalent questions, would accuse you of
<br>
blasphemy and apostasy and (within their legal system) sentence you to
<br>
death.
<br>
<p>Those guys have their equivalents in our own culture, although they're
<br>
better controlled here: questions we need to ask include &quot;will extropian
<br>
technologies damp down fundamentalist fervour (there) or increase it
<br>
(here)&quot;?
<br>
<p>Just because you don't approve of somebody's beliefs, it does not follow
<br>
that you can safely ignore them.
