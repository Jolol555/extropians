<em>&gt; The only way to deal with this is to move into new industries as

<p>Heh. Assembly for the assembly.

<p><em>&gt; means all you JAVA and Python programmers are going to have

<p>Actually you'll might find that a MISC CPU controlling your 
<br>
nanolithoprinter head with 10 k transistors complexity is 
<br>
best programmed in Forth, not in assembly. Abstraction gradient
<br>
is way higher than in any language I know, and code density
<br>
will be ridiculously high (these molecular bits are expensive).
<br>
<p>Recent advances in buckytube productions do make me think
<br>
of a MEMS desktopsized bucky sorting (you did hear about the new
<br>
trick of nuking the metal conductors from the batch by 
<br>
frying them with a current pulse, did you?), weaving and 
<br>
point-welding facility. After all these times, we might get 
<br>
knitted memories again, but not ferrite rings on copper mesh. 
<br>
A Steward platform with an electrostatically driven linear 
<br>
bucky actuator/bearing is definitely within design range. Then 
<br>
you can chuck out the MEMS scaffolding, and go whole hog bucky.
<br>
Don't know how to insulate the whole thing. One might embed
<br>
the assembly into liquid monomer, and polymerize it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to retrain.  Now, old folks like me who actually speak half a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dozen assembly languages, we will be able to name our price... :-)
</em><br>
<p>Where's NanoCAD when you need it? I'm ready to start drawing
<br>
a MISC CPU implemented in 3d bucky. I have no clue how you can
<br>
assemble it without true mechanosynthesis, but it will be certainly
<br>
damn compact, and fast (ballistic electron transport across
<br>
the whole assembly, yeah-haw!). Could probably even pump helium through
<br>
the bucky pipework, to provide cooling from the inside. Someone
<br>
please simulate inasmuch helium flow through inner lumen of bucky
<br>
circuitry will degrade their switching behaviour.
