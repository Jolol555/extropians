<p>I dont doubt that, but it is tricky business.  If I were to
<br>
make a ROM calc, what is the life expectancy now,
<br>
about 80 years?  Thats about 3E5 days and about half
<br>
the proles that perish do so because the heart gave out,
<br>
so that for a random population of about 6E5 proles I
<br>
would expect about one fatal heart attack a day, eh?
<br>
<p>Seattle is a densely populated area, so I would wag the
<br>
number of people that felt the shaker at r5 or greater
<br>
would be about, oooohhh, 3 million, so I would expect
<br>
about 5 cardiac deaths that day even if no quake.  Singling
<br>
out this one as being caused by the earth without any
<br>
other injuries, I suppose legitimate but not compelling.
<br>
<p>Nor am I arguing that quakes are not really terrifying.
<br>
That wimpy 4.2 here last Sunday got my undivided
<br>
attention, and Im an *adrenaline* junky.  That Loma
<br>
Prieta quake in 98 got my heart racing more than a
<br>
typical sexual encounter, at least for a minute or two,
<br>
so afterwards I said, good, now I dont need to work
<br>
out at the gym today.

<p><em>&gt; Rabble Rouser?  Could it be? Is this indeed

<em>&gt; Rambling Rebuilt Rambunctious Reborn Robert Reuben?
</em><br>
<p>Of course at his new Baptist church they just call him
<br>
Bob.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; MPD is not something you feel so alone as with other dis-orders.
</em><br>
<p>Sure but you see Rabble, MPD is not a disorder.  They
<br>
should have named it MPO, or multiple personality order,
<br>
for with this condition there is more to love.  {8-]
<br>
<p>Do forgive me, list, I shall cut the Robert Reuben jokes
<br>
now.  It was getting so bad I nearly had to plonk *myself*.
