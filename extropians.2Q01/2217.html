Subject: British firm produces first transgenically-cloned piglets
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON, April 11 (AFP) - The British firm which helped produce  
<br>
Dolly the sheep announced Wednesday it had brought into being the 
<br>
world's first transgenically-cloned piglets -- a major step towards 
<br>
creating animals whose organs can be safely transplanted into 
<br>
humans. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPL Therapeutics said the transgenic cloning of the five piglets  
<br>
was one step further on from the company's announcement last year 
<br>
that it had produced the world's first cloned pigs. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievement is a major step towards creating genetically  
<br>
modified pigs whose organs and cells can be transplanted into 
<br>
humans, a process known as xenotransplantation, the biotechnology 
<br>
firm said in a statement. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By transgenically cloning the piglets it aims to produce animals  
<br>
without the gene which causes their organs to be rejected by the 
<br>
human body after transplantation. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Xenotransplantation is the only near-term solution to solving  
<br>
the worldwide organ shortage crisis,&quot; PPL added. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical trials of the process could start in as little as four  
<br>
to five years and analysts estimate the organs market could be worth 
<br>
five billion dollars (5.7 billion euros, 3.5 billion pounds), the 
<br>
firm believes. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be worth as much again in terms of cellular therapies,  
<br>
such as transplantable cells that produce insulin for treatment of 
<br>
diabetes, it said. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Roslin Institute, who along with PPL achieved  
<br>
fame in 1997 for producing Dolly, the first successful cloning of a 
<br>
mammal from an adult cell, postponed experiments aimed at 
<br>
transplanting pig organs for use in human bodies amid fears that 
<br>
unknown diseases could jump the species barrier. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The concern is mainly unknown viruses, that's the frightening  
<br>
thing,&quot; Ian Wilmut, head of the Scottish research centre near 
<br>
Edinburgh, said following the postponement. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's possible there could be viruses we don't know about that  
<br>
could be released into the human population,&quot; he added. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that there was &quot;a certain reduction in the optimism of  
<br>
how practical it will be to take animals and use them in this way&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spokesman for the Church of Scotland's Society, Religion and  
<br>
Technology Project urged caution following PPL's breakthrough 
<br>
announcement. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No one knows if all the rejection mechanisms can be overcome  
<br>
sufficiently to make the medical case strong enough,&quot; said Dr Donald 
<br>
Bruce. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To do so requires the multiple genetic engineering of a large  
<br>
animal which is uncharted scientific territory. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We therefore caution against jumping to the conclusion that the  
<br>
science will inevitably work well enough -- it may, it may not,&quot; he 
<br>
added. 
<br>
