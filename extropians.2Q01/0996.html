A number of folks are understandably squeamish about running (non-cruel)
<br>
simulations of others, e.g.,

</em><br>
<p>The flaw here is that running someone is not an either/or
<br>
proposition.  There is always a question of, for example,
<br>
the speed at which the simulation is run.  If a certain 
<br>
simulation that you've created is no longer suitable for
<br>
your purposes, you might merely assign resources such that
<br>
they get a second of run time every thousand years, then
<br>
every two thousand years, then every three thousand years,
<br>
etc., a series which does not converge, i.e., it still
<br>
bestows on your creations unlimited run time.
<br>
<p>Ethically, there is nothing wrong with making a simulation
<br>
containing emulations of conscious beings, and then running
<br>
it at whatever speed you want.  Or shutting it down.  The
<br>
only moral prohibition is, simply put, &quot;Don't ever be cruel&quot;.
