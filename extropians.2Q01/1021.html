<p>You can't. I have no idea why you mention Matlab in this context.

Then why not Mathematica. Or a bandersnatch.

<p>Mike, you'd have a point if you knew what you're talking about. If you

insist on making a fool out of yourself in public, be my guest.

<p><em>&gt; open source. Something that can generally be run on a majority of

<p>Garbage. You either have the source for your application and are
<br>
practically and legally free to do with it whatever you like, or you
<br>
don't. Do you have the source for Excel? Has Redmond allowed you to give

it away for free, so I can build it on my machine? Excel is practical open

source, my ass.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Something that is only operable/editable via a complex and hard to learn

<br>
<p><em>&gt; practical purposes pose a significant barrier to entry due to its lack

</em><br>
<p>KDE, KOffice, Mozilla or StarOffice is a &quot;complex and hard to learn

application that has a poor interface&quot;? You're joking, right? Where 
<br>
have you been the last decade?

<p><em>&gt; This is why ANY GUI will always be more practically open source than the

<p>Huh? Command line Open Source crazed weasel vanilla sauce polygon?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; don't give a crap about the true open source status of the Excel source

</em><br>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That being said, I understand there are limitations (hell, I hate having
