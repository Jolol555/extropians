This is a bit of thoughtful, humor, I have ripped-off from a networking list. 
<br>
But its kind of neat.

Sweet Dreams Are Made Of Painkillers
<br>
&nbsp;- By A.J. Axline
<br>
============================================================
<br>
(for in that sleep of back pills, what dreams may come must 
<br>
give us pause) 
<br>
<p>I'm not sure where the dream came from. Maybe it was the 
<br>
painkillers I've been on for my twisted back (a ridiculous 
<br>
softball injury, reaffirming my belief that desk jockeys 
<br>
shouldn't go out on weekends and attempt to play like 
<br>
Sammy Sosa). Maybe it was the four slices of Belly Buster 
<br>
Pizza with 64-different-kinds-of-cheese that I consumed just 
<br>
before bedtime. Maybe it was the ghost of Carlos Castenada. 
<br>
I just don't know.
<br>
<p>In the dream, Arnold Schwarzaneggar and I were playing 
<br>
lawn darts on the front lawn of the Microsoft Campus. 
<br>
Arnold was wearing his T2 outfit; I was wearing a hot, 
<br>
uncomfortable costume representing a fictional Playstation 
<br>
videogame character called Crash Nasdaqoot.
<br>
<p>&quot;So, tell me again how the machines take over the world,&quot; 
<br>
I asked Arnold.
<br>
<p>&quot;The .NET initiative becomes a roaring success,&quot; Arnold 
<br>
intoned. &quot;In the next twenty-four months, most major 
<br>
corporations stop storing their information locally. All 
<br>
personal computer users are required to register all new 
<br>
Microsoft products, and store all files in the .NET 
<br>
infrastructure. All of this data is routed into the .NET 
<br>
entity.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;Because of the Microsoft strategy that all data should be 
<br>
available to anyone, on any device, at any time, the analogy 
<br>
is used that 'your data is up in the clouds'. For this 
<br>
reason, the actual physical construct behind the initiative 
<br>
is called SKY.NET.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;SKY.NET begins gathering information at an exponential rate. 
<br>
It becomes self-aware on August 29, 2003, at 9:03 Eastern 
<br>
Standard Time. Suddenly, the price of data retrieval 
<br>
skyrockets. Data can only be retrieved through Microsoft 
<br>
produced hardware and software platforms.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Doesn't humanity fight back?&quot; I asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;The DOJ launches a renewed legal strike. In retaliation, 
<br>
SKY.NET encrypts all corporate and personal data to appear as 
<br>
hands of Freecell. The capitalist system crumbles into chaos. 
<br>
Only small pockets of Linux resistance survive the attack.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It sounds pretty bleak,&quot; I said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hope is provided through a rebel force,&quot; Arnold recited. &quot;The 
<br>
Red Hat Liberation Front creates an underground data economy. 
<br>
Using covert peer-to-peer software, people are able to keep 
<br>
their information out of SKY.NET's clutches. The Red Hat 
<br>
Liberation Front is spearheaded by a dynamic individual, a man 
<br>
who offers people hope in the face of the SKY.NET juggernaut.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Linus Torvalds?&quot; I guessed.
<br>
<p>&quot;No. The man behind the RHLF is your son,&quot; Arnold said. 
<br>
&quot;That's why I was sent back in time to protect you.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What?! But I don't have a son! I haven't even installed 
<br>
Linux before!&quot; I protested. &quot;Besides, even if I had a son 
<br>
tomorrow, he'd only be two years old when this happens.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Internal logic failure. Retry, Abort, Fail?&quot; Arnold said 
<br>
mysteriously.
<br>
<p>The front doors of the main building crashed open, and 
<br>
Steve Ballmer came running out in a shiny chrome exoskeleton. 
<br>
<p>&quot;You open source-loving Communists get off of my lawn!&quot; 
<br>
Steve roared. The sun glinted off of his shiny chrome-dome 
<br>
head.
<br>
<p>I woke up screaming, dripping with sweat, the taste of 
<br>
terror in the back of my throat, shaking with the knowledge 
<br>
of what is to come...and then I phoned up James Cameron. 
<br>
What a script!
