</em><br>
<p>You need to take into account that companies such as Microsoft
<br>
or Oracle don't really have a problem getting people.  It was
<br>
the dot-com bubble that had a hard time hiring people.  In order
<br>
to solve that they were making crazy offers to lure people away
<br>
from more secure positions.  In retrospect, those offers were
<br>
justified (as the risk-reward ratio now seems to have balanced out.)
<br>
<p>While Larry or Bill might have been in general agreement that
<br>
a lower IT staff cost would be benificial, I doubt they really
<br>
put that much emphasis on it -- the VC people and dot-com-ers
<br>
on the other hand *did* have an agenda -- a company with no
<br>
people (to produce a 'product') doesn't float very well
<br>
on the market.  There was a point during '99-'00 when the
<br>
dot-com startup rate was being significantly constrained by
<br>
the lack of qualified IT workers.  Now that slice of bread
<br>
seems to have flipped so its falling butter-side down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, I have not proven this contention. It seems that what I know of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salaries made by the folks brought in to work at my company, I have heard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are making much less then the American Citizen proggies.
</em><br>
<p>This I would expect to be true.  For example I know of a brilliant
<br>
Russian scientist who is now working at Celera.  I expect they are
<br>
making less than their counterparts simply owing to the increased
<br>
overhead of communication difficulties.  There is a cost to having
<br>
a significant percentage of your staff be foreign trained and/or
<br>
non-native english speaking.  The greater management costs translate to
<br>
decreased employee salaries.
<br>
<p>I don't think you have to go to court.  As a former employer of
<br>
many foreign citizens, I'd state quite honestly that these are
<br>
management tradeoffs that do get made.  Typically senior management
<br>
hires an American to boost the productivity of what would otherwise
<br>
be less productive staff.  Depending on the relative size of the 
<br>
management pyramid this may or may not work effectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So is there currently a deep shortfall in IT workers? 
</em><br>
<p>I doubt it.  IT workers currently are going unemployed for
<br>
weeks to months (when dot-coms fold) and salaries are starting
<br>
to decline.  I'd say that is the key measure of whether or not
<br>
there is a 'shortfall'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I dunno. Is this report that I quote merely a means of shortchanging USA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers?
</em><br>
<p>I think the so-called 'shortage' existed when dot-com'ers
<br>
couldn't staff their startups.  Now I doubt that is the case.
