Extropians -- here is the press release for Extro-5. If you haven't checked 
<br>
the conference pages recently, please note that there have been quite a few 
<br>
recent updates.
<br>
<p>I'd very much appreciate it if you could forward this to any person or 
<br>
group who you think is likely to be interested. (But please don't spam 
<br>
lists that aren't likely to be interested!)
<br>
<p>If you are coming to Extro-5 but have not yet registered, I urge you to do 
<br>
soon as soon as possible. It helps us with planning (especially arranging 
<br>
the right number of banquet meals) and reduces congestion at the 
<br>
registration desk.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
<p>Max

<p>THE FUTURE'S BIG THINKERS
<br>
CONFRONT ISSUES AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS
<br>
<p>E X T R O - 5 Conference: Shaping Things to Come
<br>
San Jose, California, June 15-17, 2001
<br>
<p>We cannot ignore the growing confusion, concern, and opposition to the 
<br>
technologies that can improve and transform the human condition.
<br>
<p>Strident voices and legislation threaten to hold back progress in biotech, 
<br>
information technology, the spread of open markets, and the development of 
<br>
technologies that could cure age-old ailments, extend our lives and augment 
<br>
our capabilities.
<br>
<p>The Extro-5 international conference assembles big thinkers from numerous 
<br>
fields to provoke our culture to think more carefully about the more 
<br>
plausible perils of progress and to shape the future for the better.
<br>
<p>Extro-5 will respond to influential figures who oppose the development of 
<br>
powerful new technologies. Bill Joy has called for limits on free speech to 
<br>
stop the spread of certain technologies. He is joined by various 
<br>
&quot;ethicists&quot; and even Prince Charles in calling for a moratorium on genetic 
<br>
technologies. Others oppose technologies such as stem cell research that 
<br>
could cure disease and extend life spans.
<br>
<p>At Extro-5, a unique convergence of experts will separate the real concerns 
<br>
from those rooted in lack of knowledge or unexamined or outdated 
<br>
assumptions. Each session will bring together several high powered thinkers 
<br>
to examine the impact of advanced and accelerating technology, to look at 
<br>
opportunities and to anticipate and proactively address potential problems. 
<br>
These big thinkers and achievers will address issues around four major themes:
<br>
<p>-- Machine Super-Intelligence -- Threat or Opportunity?
<br>
-- Thriving in the Information Economy
<br>
-- Mastering the Information Explosion
<br>
-- Overcoming Resistance to Superlongevity and Augmentation
<br>
<p>Each issue will be explored from multiple disciplines while allowing ample 
<br>
time for interaction between audience and presenters. The Extro-5 
<br>
conference goes beyond voicing the views of the top experts. It also 
<br>
provides an unmatched networking opportunity for those seeking to shape the 
<br>
future for the better.
<br>
<p>Big thinkers at Extro-5: &quot;Shaping Things to Come&quot; include inventor, 
<br>
entrepreneur, and writer Ray Kurzweil, leading information economist Hal 
<br>
Varian, science correspondent Ronald Bailey, leading information economy 
<br>
strategist Steve Flinn, cyberspace economist David Friedman, best-selling 
<br>
author Greg Bear, extropic philosopher Max More, evolutionary biologist 
<br>
Michael Rose, artist and cultural catalyst Natasha Vita-More, co-architect 
<br>
of the pre-Web Xanadu hypertext system Mark Miller, and other leading 
<br>
thinkers from computing, artificial intelligence, law, &quot;hard&quot; science 
<br>
fiction, Internet technologies, neuroscience, and business.
<br>
<p>Don't miss out on this singular chance to listen to and network with those 
<br>
who are shaping the future. Stimulate your brain, expand your vision of the 
<br>
future, make contacts for your interests and businesses. Attendance is 
<br>
limited, so register now to secure your place.
