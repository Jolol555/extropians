<em>&gt; &gt; If it's even theoretically possible for a human being to write distributed

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; started out on a tight Beowulf network will be able to adapt verself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pretty easily for the Internet.  Or FPGAs.  Or nanocomputers.  Or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; galactic abacus if that's what's available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This misses the point entirely.  Who cares if an AI on a Beowulf cluster can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapt itself to the Internet if being implemented on the Internet would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually lead to a net *loss* of capability?  Distributed systems don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale infinitely or even asymptotically with the number of nodes; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually peak and then start to decrease in performance.  Slow networks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and complex problems just make the distributed system peak earlier, and AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Internet would peak very early indeed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, one could argue that a seed AI is not likely spread rapidly over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Internet because a seed AI would know enough about distributed systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be able to calculate if there was any net gain in doing so.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't take a seed AI to actually do those calculations.
</em><br>
<p>For a bandwidth-slow system, you split off a lot of independent packages
<br>
and rendezvous with them a second, minute, or hour later.  You don't get
<br>
to increase the size of your largest high-speed thought, but you can have
<br>
large but very slow thoughts, or a huge number of small and fast
<br>
thoughts.  Distributing a human brain over the Internet would slow it
<br>
down.  A seed AI distributing verself over the Internet would need to
<br>
change the character of vis cognition, but after that could take full
<br>
advantage of computing power.
<br>
<p>I'm sure you can do a mathematical proof that the Internet is
<br>
dumbfoundingly slow if you want to maintain S=1, as in the human brain,
<br>
where the characteristic communication delay time from an element to any
<br>
other element is on the order of the a single tick of a computing
<br>
element's clock speed.  But all that analysis proves is that cognition
<br>
distributed over the Internet has very high S and that local packets of
<br>
mind are isolated for millions, billions, or even trillions of ticks. 
<br>
However, you can say nothing at all about how much of an inefficiency this
<br>
represents at the *cognitive* level.
