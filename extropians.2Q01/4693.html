<p>Sure is.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently the girl was upset with me ... she went on for a full

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I can understand being upset at that.  I'm also a lot more afraid of someone
<br>
threatening someone and attempting to carry it out.  The hate mail to me
<br>
seems to threaten me, though the writer watered it down enough to make it
<br>
ambiguous.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
