'Alive' really **is** extropian music. It's amazing that the
<br>
words &quot;i WILL never die&quot; could be so effectively put to music.
<br>
It'll probably be nominated as the Cryonics International
<br>
Anthem... ---ooops! Scratch that; bad acronym.
<br>
<p>Also, the Australian accents are a bonus, making it sound
<br>
like something from The Road Warrior.  They should make a
<br>
music video of it, and get Mel Gibson to synch the words.

<p><p>Thanks for that, Lee. Yes, I wasn't joking about the extropian angle.
<p>Also, Wild Child and Fallen both have &gt;H themes (although the former is a
little more irreverant).
<p>The whole album has a thread running through it about necessary change, and
the realities of the good and bad parts of that change. I feel that all of
it is relevant to the greater ideals of extropianism (optimism, dynamism);
particularly, the issues of loss as well as gain that can arise from this
philosophy. It takes proactivity, fortitude, bloody-mindedness, and an
ability to deal with sorrow, to follow the path of dynamism, and maintain
your optimistic outlook.
<p>I posted the original message about the album on the weekend. So I'll take
this opportunity to say to those who didn't see it yet, to
 * go have a look now!*

<p>Many of you will be reading this at work, and while you may have held off
downloading over your sad modem connection at home, you may still feel
guilty about hogging your employer's high-bandwidth link for personal use. I
want to reassure you that this is the noblest of uses for those bits.
Anyway, either you saturate the link by downloading damned fine mp3s, or the
guys in marketting download div-x encoded pr0n all day. Also, listening to
fine music may just reduce your stress levels and so lengthen your life by
that all important extra little bit, helping you to make it to future life
extension technologies, or to get to the Singularity.
<p>So download a song right now, in the knowledge that, not only is it noble to
do so, it is in your enlightened self interest!

<p>(damn, I didn't realise my accent came through. Sheesh.)
