<p><em>&gt; In an ideal world, the kind that I think many mathematicians and
</em><br>
philosophers 
<br>
<em>&gt; would like to live in, political views would of course be entirely based on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimations of objective facts, with possibly some subjective values thrown 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in. People would believe in socialism or libertarianism because they made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense or benefitted them in some way. People would change their views 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on new information.  We all know this picture is not true, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder how untrue it is?
</em><br>
<p>It seems completely true to me.  (Let me ignore those cases where debaters
<br>
would suffer humiliation, so therefore continue to affirm some view, even
<br>
though they internally realize that they are totally wrong.  Especially as
<br>
a kid, I hated to lose an argument with my brother, and sometimes this
<br>
would happen to me.)
<br>
<p>In the remaining cases, when people are confronted with new information
<br>
that contradicts their long strongly held position, they can guess that
<br>
either the new information is only a half-truth, or that there is an
<br>
honest interpretation of it that is simply escaping them at the moment,
<br>
instead of instantly saying, &quot;Okay, I've been wrong for twenty years&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Psychological inertia (as below) can explain a lot of the discrepancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the philosophers' world and the real world, ...
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't call what I have just described &quot;psychological inertia&quot;
<br>
(and maybe you wouldn't either).  I would call it prudence.
<br>
<p>Of course, one is then obligated to retire and carefully reconsider,
<br>
and be ready to perhaps admit that one had been wrong at a later time.
