<p>Yes, but is it useful for those of us who know better to--deliberately or
<br>
inadvertently--perpetuate this irrational viewpoint? In my fantasies, in the
<br>
part of my mind that I use for rampant speculation, the image of having
<br>
technologies that seem like magic (even to me) is an intoxicating one. But if I
<br>
plan to broadcast these ideas out into the world it seems more prudent to
<br>
clearly label them as speculations, or write them up as fiction, unless they
<br>
can be shown to be real or at least forthcoming. The pie-in-the-sky meme is a
<br>
dangerous one whether it comes from religion or science.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; The danger lies not in ignoring
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still laugh at the absurdities of religion,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're staking out a very dangerous position here -- assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody shares your contempt for religious thinking. Most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't. In fact, if they associate such attitudes with the new technologies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll reject the technologies, because their value system (however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skewed you think it is) will lead them to conclude that those technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are inimical.
</em><br>
<p>It's taken me a long time to arrive at the same sad conclusion. When I was much
<br>
younger I railed against religious thinking with an almost religious fervor
<br>
(irony is often lost on the young). Even now, when I am confronted with what I
<br>
know to be an irrational belief, I can feel something twist up inside. However,
<br>
I have also had to accept that no amount of rationality or logical persuasion
<br>
will convince someone to believe or disbelieve something they don't want to.
<br>
Religious belief is not rational or logical, and it isn't intended to be.
<br>
People simply believe what they want to believe. Period. When someone decides
<br>
to not believe in something anymore, or to start believing in something they
<br>
haven't believed before, it is ultimately a personal decision. Sure, outside
<br>
influences can play a part, as can simple ignorance, but these aren't the
<br>
people to be concerned about.
<br>
<p>Consequently, having a contemptuous view of religion is great for a personal
<br>
system of values (and is certainly warranted, IMHO), but when directed at
<br>
religious people it is abusive and ineffective. So what do we do about it? How
<br>
do we gain allies among religious thinkers? Well, first, don't insult them.
<br>
Tolerate their beliefs while making it clear that you don't share them (this is
<br>
called taking the high road). And I say what do we care what other people
<br>
believe as long as their beliefs aren't impacting us? (And if they are, we have
<br>
to work even harder to reach an accommodation.) And remember, there are plenty
<br>
of scientists and technologists who have religious beliefs. This could be a
<br>
place to start.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Do you think you can manage to disentangle your own personal beliefs from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your analysis of how people who don't share those beliefs might behave?
</em><br>
<p>Beautifully put, Charlie. I could say &quot;Amen,&quot; but the irony might be lost. ;-)
