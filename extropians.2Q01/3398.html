</em><br>
<p>Don't worry, I noticed the tounge in the cheek. But your post was a good 
<br>
starting point.
<br>
<p>OK, now I better try to discuss near term problems from a &gt;H perspective:
<br>
<p>Cyber-attacks: I attended a meeting about information operations recently, 
<br>
and one of the main points the speaker made was that while once war was waged 
<br>
by nations against nations, now individuals, groups and nations can attack 
<br>
individual, groups and nations. We are (due to technological changes) seeing 
<br>
a kind of &quot;democratization&quot; of capability which profoundly undermines the 
<br>
legitimacy of the traditional nation state (it might be interesting to read 
<br>
the privateering paper Technotranscendence posted about in the light of 
<br>
information warfare) both by giving capabilities to non-government groups and 
<br>
also making it uncertain if governments can provide their protection against 
<br>
distributed horisontal attacks. 
<br>
<p>The meeting discussed the Swedish programs to deal with information 
<br>
operations, and it was clear that the centralist statist attitude prevalent 
<br>
among government planners was definitely one of the main problems. To deal 
<br>
with this kind of distributed threat we need distributed solutions, where the 
<br>
private sector (including informal groups, universities and other 
<br>
associations beside companies) is a cruicial part. How to manage such 
<br>
cooperations, that remains to be invented - this is an area where 
<br>
transhumanist creativity can participate and produce immediate dividends. 
<br>
Besides, we can use dealing with cyber-attacks as a training for dealing with 
<br>
nano-attacks.
<br>
<p>One China: I don't know the official Swedish policy, but the general opinion 
<br>
seems to be that Taiwan is better off not part of the PRC. Here the &gt;H angle 
<br>
is of course how to deal with abusive nation states and maybe how to play 
<br>
them against each other to increase individual freedom. 
<br>
<p>Russian artificial brain: no, it all sounds like a news hoax. There is a 
<br>
steady stream of inflated claims coming from Russia (from elsewhere too, but 
<br>
fact-checking is especially limited when it comes to Russia), and the news 
<br>
story you refer to did not appear to contain anything new. &gt;H moral: critical 
<br>
analysis of news is quite essential to avoid spending too much time on 
<br>
spurious claims.
