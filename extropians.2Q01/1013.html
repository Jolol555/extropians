</em><br>
<p>How is one to obtain Matlab for free if one is not a student or
<br>
professor? Last I knew it was a pretty hefty license fee, which I have
<br>
no intention of paying for (and wasting the time to learn) just to work
<br>
on this one project. I frankly disagree with the yapping about 'open
<br>
source'. There is a difference between true open source and practical
<br>
open source. Something that can generally be run on a majority of
<br>
people's PCs because of the ubiquity of a given sort of software is
<br>
'practical open source'. Excel spreadsheets are of this category.
<br>
<p>Something that is only operable/editable via a complex and hard to learn
<br>
application that has a poor interface may be true open source, but for
<br>
practical purposes pose a significant barrier to entry due to its lack
<br>
of utility to most people.
<br>
<p>This is why ANY GUI will always be more practically open source than the
<br>
freest of the free true open source command line operating systems. I
<br>
don't give a crap about the true open source status of the Excel source
<br>
code. Is Spike's spreadsheet editable by myself and everyone who cares
<br>
to participate? Yup, sure is, and MS can't own that.
<br>
<p>That being said, I understand there are limitations (hell, I hate having
<br>
to due calculations in PI radians in Excel, you always have problems
<br>
when adding and subtracting at the point the sign changes) to Excel. If
<br>
Matlab is truly freely downloadable and easy to use, please let me know,
<br>
but I'm not really interested in learning a whole new programming
<br>
language just to run a spreadsheet.
