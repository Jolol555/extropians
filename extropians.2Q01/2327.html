<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>The Age of Robots
<br>
We're close to making humanlike machines. It's time to reckon with the 
<br>
promises and perils
<br>
<p><p><p>By Thomas Hayden
<br>
<p><p><p>The millennium was still a half century off in the future when Isaac Asimov 
<br>
penned his sci-fi classic, I, Robot. So it must have seemed plausible to 
<br>
imagine a world populated by big, strong, intelligent humanoid robots. The 
<br>
mechanical replicas he conjured may have had shiny metal bodies and glowing 
<br>
red eyes, but they otherwise resembled people, thought like people, and–most 
<br>
important of all–devoted themselves to taking care of the human race.
<br>
<p><p>Contrary to Asimov's genre-defining tale, humankind is still operating 
<br>
pretty much on its own. Indeed, of all the great science-fiction predictions 
<br>
to go bust at the end of the millennium–no time machines, no intergalactic 
<br>
space travel–surely the most galling is the absence of a single decent 
<br>
robotic maid. Or butler, take your pick. Oh sure, the new Robomower will 
<br>
trim your lawn while you recline in the hammock, and the Dyson DC06 robotic 
<br>
vacuum cleaner will soon be available to suck the lint from your carpets. 
<br>
But if you want something from the fridge, you're still going to have to 
<br>
fetch it yourself.
<br>
<p><p>If visionaries like Asimov may have been wrong about the timing, they were 
<br>
right to predict a bright robotic future. Indeed, robots of various stripes 
<br>
seem to be popping, whirring, buzzing, and gliding up just about everywhere. 
<br>
Very practical-minded bots are at work in the real world right now, 
<br>
exploring distant planets, assisting with precision surgery, and locating 
<br>
deadly land mines. The toy market, already home to Aibos and Poo-Chis, is 
<br>
just months away from a massive invasion by robotic cats, dogs, and mice as 
<br>
well as mechatronic aliens and babies and dinosaurs. Steven Spielberg will 
<br>
set the stage for the fall shopping frenzy this summer when his movie A.I. 
<br>
does for supersmart, supersensitive robots what his Jurassic Park did for 
<br>
supersmart, supervicious dinosaurs. And labs around the world are busily 
<br>
working on the robotic parts–feet and knees for walking, hands for grasping, 
<br>
versions of eyes and ears–that will someday be stitched together into a 
<br>
fully functional humanoid robot.
<br>
<p><p>Early lessons. The dream of such a humanoid compatriot–machine enough to 
<br>
boss around but human enough to be a good sidekick–stretches back at least 
<br>
to the early 20th century. But the early decades of research proved mainly 
<br>
this: that humans are a lot more complex than originally considered–and it's 
<br>
really, really hard to build one. In the past few years, however, important 
<br>
advances in computer science, artificial intelligence, biomechanics, and 
<br>
material science have once again raised hopes of reaching the holy grail of 
<br>
robotics. In fact, progress toward a fully autonomous, intelligent robot has 
<br>
been so convincing that any number of technofuturists are worrying publicly 
<br>
about the perils of robotics. At least one highly regarded scientist, Bill 
<br>
Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, has predicted that our own robotic 
<br>
creations might one day replicate themselves and contribute to humankind's 
<br>
demise.
<br>
<p><p>Whether humans are in a hopeful or precarious place, the journey here has 
<br>
been an intellectual challenge. Don't even contemplate the brain for a 
<br>
moment. How about something simple like walking on two legs. Humans do it 
<br>
naturally, and our ancestors have for millions of years, but it took one of 
<br>
the largest industrial companies in the world 10 years and untold millions 
<br>
to build a machine that could master a workable form of bipedalism. That was 
<br>
the Honda P3, a 5-foot, 3-inch, 290-pound astronaut look-alike unveiled by 
<br>
the Japanese car company in 1996. Widely hailed as a triumph of pure 
<br>
engineering willpower, the P3 does walk convincingly and can even go up and 
<br>
down stairs. But the Honda spokesbot–P3 has been succeeded by the more 
<br>
diminuitive Asimo–can manage only a sluggish 1 mile per hour on the 
<br>
straightaway. It's going to take a lot more hustle than that to make it in 
<br>
the domestic-service racket.
<br>
<p><p>The trick to making an athletic robot is simulating the finely tuned 
<br>
orchestra of muscle, bone, and nerve that has evolved over countless 
<br>
millennia. All robots make use of the same basic components to do this. A 
<br>
jointed metal or plastic frame serves for a skeleton, and a variety of 
<br>
actuators (motors, pulleys, gears, hydraulics, and so forth) provide muscle 
<br>
power. But the new humanoids are not just bodies; they're also sophisticated 
<br>
sensing machines, packed with cameras, microphones, even &quot;haptic&quot; sensors 
<br>
that mimic the sense of touch. Significant engineering challenges still 
<br>
remain–one of the most fundamental is finding a way to power the 
<br>
energy-hungry machines–but most researchers are confident that they'll get 
<br>
the physical side of things worked out in the near future.
<br>
<p><p>And then there are the brains. At MIT's humanoid robotics lab, the 
<br>
cartoonish, head-only robot Kismet is just slightly larger than a normal 
<br>
human noggin. And yet the contraption relies on a bank of 15 external 
<br>
computers to control its social abilities and impressive array of facial 
<br>
expressions. Asimo and P3 are downright doltish by comparison, depending on 
<br>
remote-control operators and pre-scripted programs to tell them what to do. 
<br>
Other advanced humanoid bodies leave all the thinking to humans. NASA's 
<br>
prototype space worker Robonaut, for example, mimics the movements of a 
<br>
human operator in a sensor-laden &quot;tele-presence&quot; suit. The operator bends 
<br>
his elbow, and the robot bends its elbow in response, like a mechanical 
<br>
mirror image.
<br>
<p><p>Despite decades of intensive research in artificial intelligence, the brains 
<br>
are lagging behind the knees and wrists. During the field's early days, says 
<br>
Rodney Brooks, director of MIT's AI lab and its humanoid robotics group, 
<br>
researchers tried to make machines smart by writing elaborate, computerized 
<br>
problem-solving programs. They assumed the sequences of facts, physical 
<br>
laws, and logical relationships would add up to thinking. The results could 
<br>
be impressive–just ask chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, who was humbled by 
<br>
IBM's Deep Blue in 1997–but making a thinking machine turned out to be much 
<br>
harder than the scientists imagined. Chess, for all its challenges to human 
<br>
brain power, turns out to be a simpler pursuit than, say, making soup. A 
<br>
chess-bot needs only information and logic, but a chef-bot without a dash of 
<br>
creativity, intuition, and flair would be little more than an expensive, 
<br>
programmable Cuisinart. Take that pot of soup. You cut some vegetables, boil 
<br>
some bones, throw in a bay leaf or two, maybe some other spices. But what 
<br>
vegetables and how many? How to tell a turnip from a turkey leg? And, ahem, 
<br>
whose bones? And how on Earth could a robot add salt to taste with no sense 
<br>
of what &quot;saltiness&quot; means–and, for that matter, no sense of taste?
<br>
<p><p>The high marks of Enlightenment thinking–logic and problem solving–turn out 
<br>
to be much easier to simulate than the perceptual and intuitive things that 
<br>
any kid can do, Brooks says. Stuffing a computer full of facts (chicken 
<br>
bones good, dog bones bad) and equations (salt tolerances between 1 and 3 
<br>
teaspoons per quart, say) works well for number-crunching tasks. But for 
<br>
real-world smarts–remembering to grab an umbrella if it looks like 
<br>
rain–logic alone just doesn't cut it.
<br>
<p><p>So how then to proceed? Increasingly, AI researchers are looking to children 
<br>
for the answer. Kids are essentially learning machines, and while no one is 
<br>
quite sure how they do it, there's clearly a lot of imitation and 
<br>
interaction, and plenty of room for trial and error. If robots are ever 
<br>
going to have humanlike intelligence, the new thinking goes, perhaps they'll 
<br>
have to develop it the way babies do. And that, says Cynthia Breazeal, the 
<br>
MIT roboticist behind Kismet's licorice-whip lips and Groucho Marx eyebrows, 
<br>
requires social interaction.
<br>
<p><p>Kismet is programmed to seek sensory stimulation–voices, movement, 
<br>
brightness, and color–which it attracts with beguiling expressions and a 
<br>
sort of babbling baby talk. If an expression works, and a passing human 
<br>
comes up to play, Kismet's internal &quot;social drive&quot; is satiated. If not, the 
<br>
levels sink and Kismet tries a new strategy to connect. But there are 
<br>
balancing desires: Get too close and Kismet will let you know you've invaded 
<br>
its space with an exaggerated look of annoyance. Play too rough and the 
<br>
usually docile head may assume an alarming grimace or turn away.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The whole point,&quot; says Breazeal, &quot;is that the robot is trying to get you to 
<br>
interact with it in ways that can benefit its ability to learn.&quot; Basic 
<br>
movements are programmed into Kismet's behavior, but its handlers hope human 
<br>
feedback will help it learn new gestures and vocalizations by imitating 
<br>
people and storing successful attempts in its memory. &quot;It helps the robot 
<br>
learn the social meaning of its actions,&quot; Breazeal says. The goal is for 
<br>
Kismet to learn not just to &quot;think&quot; for itself but also, as every child 
<br>
must, to understand that its actions have consequences.
<br>
<p><p>What's good for the mind is good for the muscles. Maja Mataric, a computer 
<br>
scientist and roboticist at the University of Southern California, is trying 
<br>
to solve the problem of motor control. The entire range of human–or 
<br>
robot–mobility, she says, &quot;can be collapsed down to a reasonably sized set 
<br>
of movements.&quot; Called &quot;primitives,&quot; these basic motions can be combined or 
<br>
modified to produce novel activity. Take reaching. Whether you're stretching 
<br>
your racket arm out to volley a tennis ball or grabbing the lid off a 
<br>
boiling pot, says Mataric, &quot;you use a standard way of reaching, the same 
<br>
basic movement.&quot; Once a robot has the basic moves down, mimicking people is 
<br>
much easier. All it takes is a little practice, plus a few learning and 
<br>
adaptation algorithms to help the machine capitalize on its mistakes. The 
<br>
result: a bot that can learn to dance the Macarena just by watching. In 
<br>
theory anyway–a good body is hard to come by, so Mataric works mostly with 
<br>
computer simulations with realistic physical properties such as gravity and 
<br>
mass.
<br>
<p><p>Practical applications. Not all researchers buy the developmental theory of 
<br>
robot building. Kazuhiko Kawamura of Vanderbilt University, for example, 
<br>
programs his humanoid ISAC to perform practical tasks, such as feeding 
<br>
disabled patients. Machines that learn from the ground up might make for 
<br>
interesting interactions, Kawamura says, but &quot;a humanoid robot needs to have 
<br>
more than just fascinating behaviors. To me, that approach only gets you a 
<br>
robotic baby. And we don't need a robotic baby.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>While many roboticists are focused on developing useful machines, a few like 
<br>
Mataric and MIT graduate student Brian Scassellati are more interested in 
<br>
what humanoids can tell us about humans. &quot;Humanoids give us a platform for 
<br>
research,&quot; says Mataric. There's nothing like trying to build a simulation 
<br>
of a baby, for example, to show you just how much you don't know about how 
<br>
babies are built.
<br>
<p><p>Scientists are also starting to use the machines to test theories and 
<br>
notions about how brains work. &quot;There are some really nice models of how 
<br>
children learn basic social skills&quot; but few ways to test them, says 
<br>
Scassellati, who has a special interest in autism. The robot he works on, a 
<br>
rugged-looking head and torso unit named Cog, is the product of almost 10 
<br>
years of evolutionary development. Finally, says Scassellati, &quot;we're 
<br>
starting to be able to look at these models [with Cog] and say something 
<br>
intelligent about them.&quot; Testing behavioral theories with a robot, he says, 
<br>
may provide a major advantage over computer simulations, the only other 
<br>
method presently available. &quot;In building something I have to deal with the 
<br>
real social scenarios,&quot; he says, &quot;not my idea of how social scenarios should 
<br>
work. In building something, I'm forced to get it right.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>And not just right–approachable, too. These are social robots after all, so 
<br>
they won't be much use if they give people the willies. &quot;We try to build 
<br>
something that looks enough like a person so that you could treat it like a 
<br>
person and you don't feel too weird about it,&quot; says Scassellati. Stephen 
<br>
Jacobsen, a University of Utah professor whose robotics company Sarcos makes 
<br>
amusement park automata as well as terrifically sophisticated humanoid robot 
<br>
bodies, says giving a machine the look of life is really quite simple. 
<br>
&quot;First it's the movement, then it's the eyes,&quot; he says. Jerkiness is a sure 
<br>
turnoff. And as with the body, it's not always how real eyes look; rather, 
<br>
it's how they move. &quot;If the eyes are at all awkward, people just don't like 
<br>
it,&quot; says Jacobsen. &quot;But if they're graceful, people are intrigued.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>If robots are ever going to live and work with us, they've got to look good, 
<br>
too. Some designers prefer the stylized, impersonal look of Robonaut or the 
<br>
sleekly modernist Japanese humanoid SIG. For the more truly social machines, 
<br>
designers have two options; they can go for the disarmingly goofy look of 
<br>
MIT's Kismet, or they can shoot for realism. At the Science University of 
<br>
Tokyo, Fumio Hara and his team study robot-human interactions using 
<br>
intricately constructed &quot;face robots,&quot; mechatronic skulls complete with 
<br>
lifelike dentures and eyeballs. Silicone masks can be pulled over the 
<br>
underlying mechanism–transforming it into a famous athlete, for example. 
<br>
Nineteen different actuators pinch, push, and stretch the rubbery skin into 
<br>
myriad expressions, some of them human, some of them most decidedly not. Too 
<br>
much realism, it turns out, can be just as much of a social obstacle as too 
<br>
little. &quot;As you start looking more and more like a person,&quot; says 
<br>
Scassellati, &quot;you pass a certain point where it becomes scary and 
<br>
off-putting because it looks enough like a person and yet it's wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Bad PR. If it seems like the robot builders are trying to put a kinder, 
<br>
gentler face on their creations, they are. In North America, at least, 
<br>
robots have had terrible PR. We associate robots with herky-jerky movements, 
<br>
brutish strength, and a personality limited to grim, remorseless logic. 
<br>
That, says Mataric, amounts to nothing less than antirobot prejudice. &quot;There 
<br>
are all sorts of misconceptions about robots as halting, mechanical things. 
<br>
It's a stereotype. What people know is what they saw in the old movies. It 
<br>
has nothing to do with reality.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Robots' image is much better in Japan. &quot;I've always taken it for granted 
<br>
that robots are friendly and not something to compete with,&quot; says Japanese 
<br>
roboticist Hiroaki Kitano, whose futuristic SIG could win an automaton's 
<br>
beauty contest. &quot;It's very curious for me why the Americans nearly always 
<br>
portray robots [as evil].&quot; In fact, many Japanese researchers credit their 
<br>
childhood love of fictional robots–especially the peppy and resourceful 
<br>
Astro Boy, who delighted postwar Japan–with inspiring the national drive to 
<br>
develop helper robots. By legend, Astro Boy came into being in 2003–a date 
<br>
as significant to Japanese sci-fi aficionados as 2001 is here.
<br>
<p><p>There's more to Japan's domination of the emerging humanoid robot world than 
<br>
an old cartoon, of course. With their traditional markets saturated, says 
<br>
Takeo Kanade of Carnegie Mellon University, corporate giants like Honda and 
<br>
Sony are casting about for new products. &quot;Humanoid robotics is one of many 
<br>
things they're looking at as a potential new industry. They have the money, 
<br>
the technology, and the long-range vision to move into new areas.&quot; The 
<br>
products might be toys now, but these and other robotic pioneers are serious 
<br>
about developing humanoids to work as office assistants, caretakers for the 
<br>
elderly, and other human aides.
<br>
<p><p>Living robots. If learning, memory, and creative intelligence really all are 
<br>
possible, then can machine consciousness be far behind? That would depend on 
<br>
what exactly consciousness is, of course, and to date there is no 
<br>
agreed-upon definition. There's no evidence that consciousness exists 
<br>
anywhere outside of a biological brain, notes philosopher Colin McGinn in 
<br>
his book The Mysterious Flame. But neither can anyone point to a reason why 
<br>
it couldn't, short of invoking the religious or mystical. A growing number 
<br>
of experts are beginning to accept that conscious robots are all but 
<br>
inevitable sometime in the future.
<br>
<p><p>The vision they conjure up looks pretty bright for intelligent machines, but 
<br>
our own prospects may be decidedly more grim. In his bracingly ominous Wired 
<br>
essay, &quot;Why the Future Doesn't Need Us,&quot; Sun Microsystems' Bill Joy all but 
<br>
sounded the death knell for the human species last year. Advances in 
<br>
robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology, he wrote, could lead to a 
<br>
world populated by super-organisms, both biological and mechanical. By 
<br>
building machines that are like us, only smarter, stronger, and more easily 
<br>
produced, Joy suggests, we could in fact be creating our own worst enemy in 
<br>
an evolutionary battle for survival. James Martin, a technology and business 
<br>
consultant, warns of a coming alien intelligence in his book of the same 
<br>
name. As machines become ever more intelligent, he argues, they will not 
<br>
only outpace our cognitive abilities but will develop new forms of thinking 
<br>
that will be beyond our comprehension. If we can't understand what we've 
<br>
built, we may not be able to control it. Ray Kurzweil, an 
<br>
artificial-intelligence pioneer, gives us about 20 more years of 
<br>
intellectual superiority over computers. By that time, he argues in The Age 
<br>
of Spiritual Machines, computers won't just be intelligent, they'll be 
<br>
conscious, feeling beings deserving of the same rights, privileges, and 
<br>
considerations we give each other.
<br>
<p><p>Beyond a morass of ethical issues, what exactly might all of this mean for 
<br>
humanity? The speculations range from the catastrophic to the merely creepy. 
<br>
Most unpleasant is the &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; scenario, where the 
<br>
machines turn the tables and enslave us for a change. There is actually 
<br>
historical precedent for a robot rebellion; the word robot comes from 
<br>
robota, the Czech for an annual debt of forced labor. In 1848, the serfs 
<br>
rose up against their Austro-Hungarian landlords in protest. A different 
<br>
story, to be sure, but the term and the concept of mechanized serfs entered 
<br>
the Western consciousness with the grim baggage of class warfare.
<br>
<p><p>Alternatively, the robots of the future could simply ignore us, leaving us 
<br>
to pursue our archaic organic mode of life, irrelevant but hardly dangerous. 
<br>
Finally, there is the &quot;if you can't beat 'em, join 'em&quot; scenario. Hans 
<br>
Moravec, a roboticist at Carnegie Mellon University, proposes that humanity 
<br>
may be able to survive, and even achieve a level of immortality, by 
<br>
digitally uploading our own consciousness into advanced robots.
<br>
<p><p>We're probably decades away from having to worry about anything more than 
<br>
running out of batteries. Still, it seems clear that big changes are coming, 
<br>
and while humans–the flesh and blood type–usually manage to adapt to 
<br>
technological change, the period of adjustment can sometimes get pretty 
<br>
uncomfortable. As with any new technology, there will certainly be some 
<br>
unintended, and quite possibly unpleasant, consequences as robots begin to 
<br>
play a regular role in our day-to-day lives, USC's Mataric notes. But she's 
<br>
confident that the potential benefits outweigh the risks. &quot;I hope society is 
<br>
strong and wise enough to stop abuses without stopping science,&quot; she says, 
<br>
&quot;but I think all of that is still a long way off.&quot; Before anyone has to 
<br>
start really worrying about our place in the future, the techies have a heck 
<br>
of a lot more work to do.
