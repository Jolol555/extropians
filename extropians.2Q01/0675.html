</em><br>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that enzymes work via a large number of very
<br>
weak bonds.  The active site gets its specificity and selectivity through
<br>
having a very close fit to the reactants so that the weak binding forces
<br>
will cumulatively have a strong effect.  Qualitatively, this suggests that
<br>
even minor perturbations which would change the shape of the active site
<br>
only slightly could still significantly reduce overall binding energy.
<br>
<p>The analogy I have seen (may have been from Nanomedicine) is like a glove
<br>
that is carefully hand-tailored to fit just one person.  When worn, it
<br>
is smooth and supple and barely touches the skin.  But if someone else
<br>
tries to put it on it binds and pulls and pinches.  Make even a slight
<br>
change to the glove and it won't fit nearly as well.
<br>
<p>It may be that this analogy works better for some enzymes than others.
<br>
Some enzymes have a relatively easy job and won't need such a precise
<br>
fit to the reactants.  These would be more immune to small changes in
<br>
the protein.  But others have to work harder to catalyze their reactions
<br>
and these would be less tolerant of even seemingly minor changes.
