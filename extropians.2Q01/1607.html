As some of you may know, Gina's absence from this list (which she has 
<br>
always  thoroughly enjoyed for its very stimulating discussions) and 
<br>
from her Web site this year results from delayed prosecution for a 
<br>
tragic automobile accident that occurred several years ago in 
<br>
California, before she put her interest in nanotechnology in high 
<br>
gear and moved to Seattle. She was sentenced in January to two years 
<br>
in prison for vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence.  Her 
<br>
parole date has not been set yet, nor does she yet know where she 
<br>
will be incarcerated for the remainder of her sentence, but she would 
<br>
appreciate mail from anyone who would care to write. The following 
<br>
mailing address should be stable for a month or two, and mail to it 
<br>
will be forwarded to wherever she is moved next for at least 30 days. 
<br>
I will post her next address when if becomes available (or anyone who 
<br>
wishes is welcome to write me off list).

<br>
<p>If you wish to write, remember that there are rules that need to be 
<br>
followed since this is a maximum security prison, complete with razor 
<br>
wire and guards with submachine guns everywhere. All women prisoners, 
<br>
regardless of crime or eventual security level are sent here for 
<br>
classification. All mail is thoroughly searched and usually delayed a 
<br>
week or two before Gina receives it. Do not send anything else in the 
<br>
letter, like books or magazines. Computer print outs of web pages, 
<br>
etc. are OK. Nano news items are especially appreciated since she 
<br>
does not have computer access (or any other news source). Use either 
<br>
regular letter envelopes or plain manila envelopes, no padded 
<br>
envelopes. Regular photographs are OK, but no Polaroids or anything 
<br>
with a backing. Envelopes (no more than 20), stamps (no more than 
<br>
40), and lined writing paper (no more than 100 sheets) are OK, but no 
<br>
pens or pencils. She does have plenty of writing materials that I 
<br>
have sent her (although books of stamps are always welcome), however, 
<br>
and she already has her quota of books she is allowed to receive that 
<br>
I have ordered for her from Amazon.
