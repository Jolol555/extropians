<p>I must inhabit a baser world than you, because your two scenarios happen to
<br>
me all the time. For the record, I did do a bunch of computability classes,
<br>
and wouldn't want to forget them now that I know them. I only recommended
<br>
against them if one was choosing a minimal first-cut to learn compsci (or
<br>
programming, at least, which I think is closer to what was asked).
<br>
<p>Also, I'd protest that it takes knowledge of P vs NP, etc etc, to end up in
<br>
the scenario you propose above. More often than not, I find coders can't go
<br>
far past a linked list or array before knees begin to wobble. You don't have
<br>
to suggest anything too elegant before people accuse it of being obscure and
<br>
unmaintainable, and &quot;generally unworkable&quot; - try saying &quot;general tree&quot; to a
<br>
VB coder. The same people will try to build multiuser systems with Access as
<br>
the backend (after all, it's cheap). Show of hands... how many people out
<br>
there have ended up on the &quot;maintenance&quot; end of a system like that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of my favorites is &quot;Please show the business case for implementing X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly (as it should be implemented) rather than using what [the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kludge generating tons of maintenance and scalability headaches] we got
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; producers and consumers which one would assume is given by the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;shared&quot; and &quot;queue&quot;.  Ah well.   This one comes up a bit more often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with &quot;Give me a concrete example&quot; when what is being discussed is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful and time saving [and usually very basic] abstraction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, it never matters to those people. It's the (railroaded) technical
<br>
architects who carry the can when the fundamentally flawed system falls in a
<br>
heap.
<br>
<p>This is the same kind of thinking that produces the &quot;behavourist&quot; system
<br>
implementation method. You know, where you whack a bunch of forms together,
<br>
then just hack out stuff to get the behaviour right (where &quot;right&quot; is, more
<br>
often than not, redefined on a daily basis). I haven't been working in IT
<br>
quite long enough to have lost my sense of surprise when people suggest this
<br>
for complex distributed systems. Those are the projects where, just after
<br>
the &quot;design&quot; phase is done, you should get your resume together in
<br>
preparation for jumping contracts just before the implementation phase is
<br>
supposed to be finished.
<br>
<p>What I personally really hate is having to explain to people why such a
<br>
system will not scale, will never be robust or even stable, why it is barely
<br>
even maintainable, let alone extensible... gaaah. You know... when people
<br>
want to get that 3 user system and roll it out to 100+ users enterprise wide
<br>
over the corporate WAN, and interface is with a handful of corporate
<br>
information systems... blech.
<br>
<p>Sometimes I find it difficult to muster up that &quot;can-do&quot; attitude :-)
