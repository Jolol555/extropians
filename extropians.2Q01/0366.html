(from cryonet)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A focus for vitrification research in the literature has been on
<br>
penetrating cryoprotectants with relatively low critical warming
<br>
rates. The theory has been that solutions incorporating these solvents
<br>
would avoid recrystalization at lower and hopefully less toxic
<br>
concentrations. Unfortunately these cryoprotectants tend to be quite toxic
<br>
even at low concentrations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative strategy would be to cast the net wider to include
<br>
more consideration of cryoprotectants with exceptionally low toxicity,
<br>
rather than the lowest critical warming rates. A clear standout in this
<br>
regard is trimethylene glycol. It is the only cryoprotectant which gave no
<br>
evidence of any toxic effect at the maximum dosage tested (3.1 M), as
<br>
measured by rabbit spermatozoa mobility. (Incubation of spermatozoa was
<br>
for 30 minutes at 20 C.) DMSO earned second place with a maximum non toxic
<br>
concentration of 2.17 M. Ethylene glycol was third at 1.55 M. Lactamide,
<br>
acetamide, and propionamide tied for fourth at 0.93 M. Butyramide,
<br>
dimethylformamide, glycerol, and malomide proved  to be yet more
<br>
toxic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glycerol has been used in vitrification solutions. The critical
<br>
warming rate for trimethylene glycol is about the same as for glycerol
<br>
(see Cryobiology 40: 151-158 2000). I suspect that replacing glycerol in
<br>
vitrification solutions with trimethylene glycol would reduce
<br>
vitrification solution toxicity significantly.
<br>
<p>Note: The medline abstract below unfortunately hides 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trimethylene glycol's exceptional property.

Abstract
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Semen was diluted 1:9  with egg yolk-citrate medium containing 0.31--3.1 M
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(final concentration) formamide, butyramide, acetamide, propionamide,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dimethylformamide, lactamide, malomide, ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) or glycerol. After 30 min incubation at 20 degrees
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;C, sperm motility was superior in hypertonic solutions of acetamide,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lactamide, dimethylsulphoxide, trimethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these compounds were added to semen diluted 1:2 in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an isotonic egg-yolk-glucose-lactose-raffinose solution and frozen by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;pellet method. Relatively good survival of motility was obtained in 1.0
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;M-DMSO, -lactamide or -acetamide. Dimethylformamide (0.5 M), ethylene glycol
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(0.5--1.5 M), trimethylene glycol (1.5 M) and propionamide (0.75 M) also gave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;some protection. Insemination of does with semen frozen and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thawed with 1.0 M-DMSO, -lactamide or acetamide gave fertilization rates of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;68--88%, and 84% (38/45) of does gave birth to an average of 5.3 young.
