<p>Yes, RCA 1802 COSMAC, a nice little processor. I wrote some data capture,

barcode reading, modem communications, and a BCD arithmetic package for

it in assembler. Our hardware had no UART, so the modem code consisted
<br>
mostly of timing loops, and the barcode reader could only return 0 for

black and 1 for white. The rest was software.

<p>Control Data Compass, CD-8090, or something else?

<p>Well it depends.. I wrote a disassembler fos OS/360 in COBOL. The COBOL-68
<br>
had excellent file, buffer, and data control. I wrote the Ackermann function
<br>
in COBOL (had to add a stack in software, since PERFORM stacks could only
<br>
handle a stack depth of 9 addresses), and first used LISP (INTERLISP) through
<br>
punched cards.
<br>
<p>The high tech of yesteryear become the junk of tomorrow. For some time, I had
<br>
27 SUN-3's stacked in my living room. Today I mostly have SPARCs, DECs, and
<br>
obsolescent PCs.  The Singularity cometh...
