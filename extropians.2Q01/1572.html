</em><br>
<p><p>This does not follow.  A program is either conscious or it is not.  Any
<br>
equivalent representation/re-factoring of the program will therefore have
<br>
the same consciousness characteristics of the original (there is more than
<br>
one way to write any program).  A lookup table is a perfectly equivalent
<br>
programmatic form, if not particularly space efficient.  Therefore, encoding
<br>
any conscious program as a lookup table will still be conscious, trading
<br>
space for speed.  How can you dispute this given your premise?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sure, you'd apparently get the right behavior as output.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the real Eugene would no longer be with us.  Right now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask him a question, and the wheels really turn.  A great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal of logic and calculation occurs, where, significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of information flows from state to subsequent state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in this lookup table, there is no actual calculation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At each point in time, you merely form the enormous 10^30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit long address; say 10^10 bits for the input this milli-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second, and 10^20 bits for his current state, and voila!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You fetch from the computronium his next state.  But no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information flows. It's not a real calculation, I think.
</em><br>
<p><p>What is a &quot;calculation&quot;?  I find the distinction between &quot;calculation&quot; and
<br>
&quot;lookup&quot; to be meaningless.  At the primitive hardware instruction level
<br>
every program uses the same small variety of atomic operations.  Do some
<br>
small sequences of atomic operations magically produce consciousness while
<br>
others do not?  A lookup is as algorithmic as any other bit of program.
<br>
Setting a memory word to zero and XOR-ing the same memory word a thousand
<br>
times doesn't produce different results, just different efficiencies.  I
<br>
don't think you would submit that the small number of hardware instructions
<br>
that differ between a &quot;lookup&quot; and a &quot;calculation&quot; are responsible for
<br>
consciousness.  If you looked at the machine code for these algorithms, they
<br>
are far more similar in nature than the cosmetic differences you see in a
<br>
high-level language.
<br>
<p>Heck, that would make the problem easy.
