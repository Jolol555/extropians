<em> &gt; Hi James,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;    If you're willing, would talk a little bit about how you came to your
</em><br>
<em> &gt;political beliefs?  How have they changed over time?  For
</em><br>
<em> &gt;example, were you raised in a politically active family?  What books have 
</em><br>
been
<br>
<em> &gt;most influential for you?
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm a pomo-universalist when it comes to politics and values. I.e. I 
<br>
acknowledge that my politics and values are products of a particular time 
<br>
and place. My parents were middle-class liberals, sympathetic with the 
<br>
civil rights, feminist and anti-war movements. My mother was elected 
<br>
President of Ohio State U's student body, where she attempted to kick ROTC 
<br>
off campus and integrate the frats, and she went to Cuba to meet with 
<br>
Castro after the Revolution. My father was a militant atheist and Blue 
<br>
Cross executive who supported national health insurance. I grew up in the 
<br>
Unitarian Church, joined the Yippies in high school, became a bisexual 
<br>
radical feminist (would have been a lesbian separatist but for the 
<br>
unfortunate accident of being a man) and world federalist, flirted with 
<br>
Trotskyism, and then joined the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) 
<br>
while attending Oberlin College, itself a leftist crucible.
<br>
<p>I spent two years after college working for a Buddhist development 
<br>
organization in Sri Lanka - for a while as an ordained Buddhist monk - 
<br>
where I developed a severe allergy for racialism and nationalism, including 
<br>
alleged progressive varieties (e.g. IRA, Zionism, etc.), and renewed 
<br>
commitment to secular radical democracy and world federalism. Organized for 
<br>
the Buddhist Peace Fellowship in Kyoto for a year, then came back to the 
<br>
University of Chicago for a PhD in Sociology. Studied under James Coleman, 
<br>
Adam Przeworski, Ed Laumann, and William Julius Wilson, and drank deeply 
<br>
from the trough of rational choice theory, albeit reluctantly.
<br>
<p>Organized the U of C DSA chapter, took over student government, founded and 
<br>
managed a national zine called EcoSocialist Review (1988-1996), and served 
<br>
on the Chicago DSA executive, the DSA national executive commiteee and 
<br>
youth executive committee. Put up the first websites for the Socialist 
<br>
International, DSA, and Progressive Caucus of the House of Representatives.
<br>
<p>Became interested in transhumanism/extropianism when I started writing 
<br>
about bioethics and genetic engineering while teaching at the University of 
<br>
Chicago's Center for Clinical Medical Ethics. I found bioethicists and most 
<br>
of the Left, especially the Greens, too Luddite on medical technology. 
<br>
After closing up the EcoSocialist Review and moving to Connecticut with my 
<br>
wife and kids, I started Changesurfer Radio as a vehicle for exploring and 
<br>
defining a &quot;left futurist/democratic transhumanist politics&quot;.
<br>
<p>Are my politics the only logical extrapolation of incontrovertible laws of 
<br>
nature? No. But I think I'm pretty open-minded, and have seriously engaged 
<br>
with libertarian challenges to social democracy/democratic socialism since 
<br>
college. I became an advocate of drug legalization in the 1980s, which 
<br>
meant being race-baited and condemned as a petit bourgeois wanker by half 
<br>
my comrades. (They agree with me now.) I'm a market socialist, as are most 
<br>
socialists today, in that I acknowledge the important and inescapable role 
<br>
of markets as efficient communication mechanisms between firms and 
<br>
consumers, supply and demand.
<br>
<p>And since my political frame of reference is European and Latin American 
<br>
social democratic politics, I often find American left politics woefully 
<br>
ignorant of the real compromises that building a majoritarian and 
<br>
economically successful social policy requires. I think my political views 
<br>
are a good explanation of history, and that my policy prescriptions are a 
<br>
pragmatic program that will lead to improvement in the human condition.
<br>
<p>But there is no certainty in values or politics, Rand's A=A 
<br>
notwithstanding. I think its ultimately a leap of faith.
<br>
<p>Thanks for asking.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; What beliefs, if any, have you modified as a result of participating on this
</em><br>
list?
<br>
<p>None. The level of histrionic shouting and anti-statist bellowing that 
<br>
passes for political discussion on this list has never really penetrated my 
<br>
ideological defences. Although perhaps if I read more than 1% of all posts 
<br>
my mind would soon be pureed into a blend of Hayek and Friedman. But I 
<br>
doubt it.
