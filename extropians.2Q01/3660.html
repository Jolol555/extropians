<p>I agree that there are better strategies than the only two I
<br>
mentioned. I tried to point out that one kind of error had
<br>
disastrous potential, while the other didn't.
<br>
<p>I also agree with you that in our modern world there are many
<br>
situations in which being overly cautious is bad strategy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; John F. Shumaker has propounded the theory that certain aspects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of nature (random accidents, brutality, death) are too frightening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for most humans to confront. By distorting reality with myths, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enjoy &quot;greater peace of mind and body&quot; and tend to live longer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;#Naaah; they're just trying to make sense of what they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand. Once they have it figured, they're less stressed and live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer.
</em><br>
<p>I suspect that many people, when they reject religious superstition,
<br>
experience some kind of &quot;intellectual or existential void&quot; from
<br>
which they don't recover, and hence on average die sooner than
<br>
the religious believers. I also expect that because of the values
<br>
and beliefs I now hold (including extropian principles), and my
<br>
practices related to personal health, I'm likely to live longer (even
<br>
in the absence of technological life-extension advances) than
<br>
even Mormons who wear &quot;protective underwear!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There may also be biological origins of human error. The &quot;triune
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain theory&quot; claims that the human brain evolved in such a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the modern human brain actually consists of &quot;three brains&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a primitive reptilian brain, a more evolved but still primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mammalian/emotional limbic system, and a modern neocortex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or thinking brain. Under certain conditions of stress and/or real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or perceived threat, the more primitive brain structures tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take over control, sometimes resulting in irrational behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;#Whatever the cause, this can of course be overcome through training
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and discipline. OTOH, lizard brain has its uses...
</em><br>
<p>There may be times when the limbic system needs to take
<br>
over control to initiate rapid action before the neocortex has
<br>
time to think about it. There are also times when the lizard
<br>
brain is ideal for initiating &quot;fight or flight!&quot;
<br>
<p>Problems can arise when people (who lack the necessary
<br>
training and discipline), for example, become overly emotional
<br>
when it would serve them better to be rational.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Conformity is also a factor. In primitive tribes, if you didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conform so as to be &quot;like everybody else,&quot; you risked being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kicked out, most likely leading to an early death. The conformists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tended to survive and the nonconformists tended to die off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;#Strictly interpreted, this would have led to perpetual stagnation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Therefore, it's not entirely accurate. The conformists are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;swinging through the trees.
</em><br>
<p>Correct. There have probably always been &quot;clever nonconfirmists&quot;
<br>
who pretended to be conformists most of the time and didn't
<br>
rock the boat more than could be tolerated. (At the risk of
<br>
seeming paternalistic, I must confess that so far on this
<br>
topic I've written at a fairly high level of abstraction and
<br>
generality, to avoid mentioning some specific human errors
<br>
that might result in my being perceived as a crackpot!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Certain &quot;professionals&quot; (such as medical doctors and lawyers)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; command a great deal of power, money, and respect to the extent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that their customers are ignorant and error-prone. The economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interest of many &quot;professionals&quot; is for their clients to be so ignorant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and error-prone that they often need &quot;expert&quot; assistance, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so ignorant and error-prone that they die too soon! -- the longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the victims can be &quot;milked,&quot; the better!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;#Look at applying this logic to government; the Nanny State.
</em><br>
<p>This is done comprehensively in  'The Anatomy of Slavespeak'
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.shtml</a>&gt; and related reports.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Philosophers such as Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and Rand have indicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that most animals automatically develop to achieve their full potential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Humans are different in that we need to make a deliberate effort to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; develop our minds and bodies correctly. Lazy conformists who don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make this special, deliberate, continuous effort to develop their minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and bodies tend to stagnate in errors of relative mediocrity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;#Seems to conflict with earlier--conformists survive; nonconformists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;die out.
</em><br>
<p>For best results, nonconformists need to operate intelligently,
<br>
that is, pretend to be conformists much of the time -- &quot;When in
<br>
Rome, do as the Romans!&quot;

<p><em>&gt; &gt; * Education -- To the extent that the powerful (who seek to acquire the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wherewithal to survive with least effort) control education, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely to &quot;shape&quot; education to produce relatively helpless, ignorant, weak,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; error-prone, obedient workers and worshippers who suffer from their
</em><br>
