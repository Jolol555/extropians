<p>
&quot;So what follows is that whether we are material or simulated beings or not, 
<br>
it is almost certain that we have been created by posthuman beings, unless 
<br>
posthumans one and all join hands and sing the praises of the categorical 
<br>
imperative not to create humans.&quot;
<br>
<p>It seems that that &quot;categorical imperative&quot; is a predominant way of thought 
<br>
these days, judging by the people's reactions to genetic engineering.
<br>
<p>I have come up with this scenario: Suppose that the contra-genetics, 
<br>
contra-simulation parties win, and everyone &quot;joins hands and sings the 
<br>
praises&quot; of not making any such experiences. Suppose also that, as it would 
<br>
inevitably occur, some rogue AI programmer decides to break the law and 
<br>
create a simulation at his home. Being the effort of a sole programmer in 
<br>
hiding, and let's suppose this particular programmer wasn't very bright, his 
<br>
simulated humans would have a &quot;unperfect&quot; AI, in a sense that they would be 
<br>
less smart than his world's ordinary humans, in such a way that any person 
<br>
who saw the simulated beings would be appaled at their incredible lack of 
<br>
intelligence, to such an extent that they would have serious trouble 
<br>
agreeing that those entities were in fact human beings with some sort of 
<br>
&quot;free will&quot; and not merely &quot;zombies&quot;. Suppose that those beings just spent 
<br>
their entire lives squabbling over food and other resources that were, in 
<br>
fact, extremely abundant in their environment, but they considered scarce 
<br>
because they weren't able to find food in other places besides the immediate 
<br>
vicinity of their feet.
<br>
<p>Then one day, the authorities would find out these simulated &quot;things&quot;. These 
<br>
unfortunate creatures lived in constant suffering, put in a world that their 
<br>
weak minds weren't able to cope with by a sadistic programmer, getting 
<br>
killed by simple things without knowing why, starving to death because of 
<br>
their incapacity, struggling with each other due to glitches in their AI's, 
<br>
etcetera. Well, supposing you were asked your opinion about what should be 
<br>
done to the simulation and those in it (note that you could nevertheless be 
<br>
in the side opposing the &quot;joining of hands and singing of praises&quot; and still 
<br>
be asked your opinion), what would that opinion be?
