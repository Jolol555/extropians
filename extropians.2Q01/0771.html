As stupidity is entropic, extropians look forward to superintelligence, as
<br>
indicated by the dominant theme of Extro-5:
<br>
MACHINE INTELLIGENCE &amp; FRIENDLY SUPER-INTELLIGENCE
<br>
Accordingly, we ought to examine the power of stupidity, if only for the
<br>
sake of avoiding it. The following outlines some of the hazards of that
<br>
examination. --J. R.
<br>
<p><p>The Power of Stupidity
<br>
<a href="http://www.rageboy.com/Stupidity.html">http://www.rageboy.com/Stupidity.html</a>
<br>
Here are the Five Laws of Stupidity according to Carlo Cipolla:
<br>
<p>First Law
<br>
We always underestimate the number of stupid people.
<br>
<p>This is not as obvious as it sounds, says Cipolla, because:
<br>
<p>people we had thought to be rational and intelligent suddenly turn out to
<br>
be unquestionably stupid;
<br>
and
<br>
<p><p>day after day we are hampered in whatever we do by stupid people who
<br>
invariably turn up in the least appropriate places.
<br>
He also observes that it is impossible to set a percentage, because any
<br>
number we choose will be too small.
<br>
<p>Second Law
<br>
The probability of a person being stupid is independent of any other
<br>
characteristic of that person.
<br>
<p>If you study the frequency of stupidity in the people who come to clean up
<br>
classrooms after hours, you find that it is much higher than you expected.
<br>
You assume that this is related to their lower level of education, or to
<br>
the fact that non-stupid people have better chances of obtaining good
<br>
jobs. But when you analyze students or University professors (or, I would
<br>
add, computer programmers) the distribution is exactly the same.
<br>
<p>Militant feminists may be incensed, says Cipolla, but the stupidity factor
<br>
is the same in both genders (or as many genders, or sexes, as you may
<br>
choose to consider). No difference in the sigma factor, as Cipolla calls
<br>
it, can be found by race, color, ethnic heritage, education, etcetera.
<br>
<p>Third (and Golden) Law
<br>
A stupid person is someone who causes damage to another person, or a group
<br>
of people, without any advantage accruing to himself (or herself) -- or
<br>
even with some resultant self-damage.
<br>
<p>(We shall come back to this, because it is the pivotal concept of the
<br>
Cipolla Theory.)
<br>
<p>Fourth Law
<br>
Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid
<br>
people. They constantly forget that at any moment, and in any
<br>
circumstance, associating with stupid people invariably constitutes an
<br>
expensive mistake.
<br>
<p>That (I would say) suggests that non-stupid people are a bit stupid -- but
<br>
I shall get back to this point at the end.
<br>
<p>Fifth Law
<br>
A stupid person is the most dangerous person in existence.
<br>
<p>This is probably the most widely understood of the Laws, if only because
<br>
it is common knowledge that intelligent people, hostile as they might be,
<br>
are predictable, while stupid people are not. Moreover, its basic
<br>
corollary:
<br>
<p>A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit
<br>
<p>leads us to the heart of the Cipolla Theory. There are four types of
<br>
people, he says, depending on their behavior in a transaction:
<br>
<p>Hapless
<br>
Someone whose actions tend to generate self-damage, but also to create
<br>
advantage for someone else.
<br>
<p>Intelligent
<br>
Someone whose actions tend to generate self-advantage, as well as
<br>
advantage for others.
<br>
<p>Bandit
<br>
Someone whose actions tend to generate self-advantage while causing damage
<br>
to others.
<br>
<p>Stupid
<br>
We already have this definition in the Third Law.
