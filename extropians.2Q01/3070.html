<p>
Interesting point, but it fails to take into account
<br>
that Art Bell's show is syndicated live 
<br>
worldwide in more markets than any other AM 
<br>
(mediumwave) show - or, for that matter, any other
<br>
radio show of any type in history - and is thus
<br>
for that reason alone a _very_ attractive soapbox.
<br>
<p>Let me put it this way: if _you_ were offered 4 hours
<br>
on a worldwide radio show where the radio host, no
<br>
matter his personal views (Art Bell, in this case),
<br>
gave you an opportunity to talk about something you
<br>
love, and treated you in a consistently gentlemanly
<br>
manner, would _you_ turn it down?  
<br>
<p>Judging a man
<br>
by the company he keeps is not a 100% reliable 
<br>
personality assessment metric, by the way, 
<br>
_especially_ when someone is trying to step 
<br>
outside his or her comfort zone and convince 
<br>
strangers of something they'd not previously
<br>
considered.
<br>
<p>It's worth noting that a large number of good,
<br>
non-flaky scientists have indeed done just that,
<br>
using Art Bell's show as a soapbox.
<br>
<p>The 2.5 hours I heard of Mark Pesce's 4.0 hour
<br>
appearance were a remarkable performance.  I've
<br>
not heard the first 1.5 hours but, if they're
<br>
anything like the latter hours, I must congratulate 
<br>
Mark on a job well done.  I've done - in the distant
<br>
past before I swore off it - radio, TV, newspaper,
<br>
and magazine interviews.  It's a hard job.  Doing
<br>
it for 4 hours - and doing it well - is an 
<br>
accomplishment.
<br>
<p>Mark is a transhumanist, not an extropian (his words
<br>
to me in email), but the bulk of what he said is what
<br>
most
<br>
of us might have said if we were as practiced as
<br>
Mark.  This is a &quot;credit where credit is due&quot; issue.
<br>
