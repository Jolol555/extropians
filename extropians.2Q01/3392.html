<em>&gt; In my parlance, majoritarian means trying to building a political

practice,
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not very majoritarian, since most of my political passions

(progressive
<br>
<em>&gt; taxation, drug legalization, polygamy legalization, world government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum guaranteed income, Mars colonization, freedom for transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancements, etc.) are supported by less than 5% of the population. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since winning these policies electorally requires majorities, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little choice but to try to win over the masses. In that respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majoritarian is just the opposite of elitist, putschist or John Galtist.
</em><br>
<p>There are some problems with this.  One, it is not the common definition of
<br>
majoritarianism.  The common definition is &quot;the philosophy or practice
<br>
according to which decisions of an organized group should be made by a
<br>
numerical majority of its members.&quot;  If you want to change definitions,
<br>
that's okay, but it can be confusing to others, especially if you redefine
<br>
them in a way that makes them politically or morally charged.  The way you
<br>
use the word, you are making into a false choice between being a
<br>
majoritarian or being an elitist.
<br>
<p>Two, it's contentless on the philosophical level.  Someone who holds vastly
<br>
different views than you and a vastly different political philosophy could
<br>
be a majoritarian.  One could be, e.g., for censorship, legally mandated
<br>
racial segregation, English-only, publicly beating homosexuals, and killing
<br>
drug users and still be a majoritarian.  It seems like only a tactical move.
<br>
Remeber, according to polls, the majorities in some places accept some of
<br>
the views.
<br>
<p>Three, in actual extant societies, it's rarely a majority that decides.  In
<br>
the US, hardly a majority of the population even votes.  (I'm using voting
<br>
here because this is the means we get majoritarian rule, no?)  In all
<br>
nations, too, there are limits on who can vote.  Typically felons, children,
<br>
the legally insane, and recent immigrants are not allowed to vote.  So, you
<br>
still have to define which majority.  Also, if, as in the US, a majority of
<br>
even those who can vote don't, then are you willing to not certify an
<br>
elections results.  (As a side issue, would this mean the offices are not
<br>
filled or decisions are not made -- or that the status quo is maintained?  I
<br>
bring this up because school board elections in most of the US usually net
<br>
less than 10% of the registered voters.  Other elections typically get four
<br>
or five times that many voters.  What would you recommend in such
<br>
situations?)
<br>
<p>Fourth, a minor point is that Ayn Rand basically believed in convincing the
<br>
majority too.  She was not a radical democrat for sure, but she thought, in
<br>
the long run, the majority rules.  Her view was, of course, that any
<br>
movement always starts with one person or a tiny minority than influences
<br>
more and more if and until it reaches prominence.
<br>
<p>As for John Galt, he was more a separatist than a putschist.  The
<br>
juxtaposition kind of makes me think you believe there's no difference.
<br>
Someone who wants to otherthrow a government is a lot different than someone
<br>
who just wants out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Which is so trivial an assertion as to be of no consequence whatsoever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently not so trivial that it failed to give you any humility in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certitude of your own beliefs. But then, since you don't come from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian family or environment, converts are often the most fervent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evangelists.
</em><br>
<p>Which is pure ad hominem -- even if true.:)  I think one problem with the
<br>
context argument is that it does not get us anywhere.  I came from a
<br>
basically Leftist familial background, though throughout my life I was
<br>
exposed to people from various political and apolitical camps, from
<br>
Situationists to neoNazis.  I suspect all of us have this too.  I didn't
<br>
spend most of my time, with my family.  I was in a government school for
<br>
most of my waking hours or with friends.  Now, all of these people weren't
<br>
libertarians.  Most were either, in American parlance, Liberals,
<br>
Conservatives, or Moderates.
<br>
<p>My point is not to say, well, we can never know, but that just arguing from
<br>
backgrounds does offer us the answers to political or any problems.  The
<br>
point should be to transcend our backgrounds.  If we can't do that, then
<br>
forget this thread and let's talk about areas we can work on together.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sure that's comforting to you, that your libertarianism is simply the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of reason and an open mind, but I feel the same way about my
</em><br>
beliefs.
<br>
<em>&gt; If the degree to which you disagree with your parents and school about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics was an indicator of the degree to which reason guides your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics, skinhead Nazis would be the most reasonable of all.
</em><br>
<p>Let's take this to another level.  What is the purpose of politics?  What
<br>
needs does it answer?  In other words, why politics?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; But there is no certainty in values or politics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Here's a loathable self-defeating statement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, there are some wonderful French philosophers I could recommend you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read, such as Camus, Foucault and Lyotard, but I suppose you probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already have.
</em><br>
<p>I would recommend Camus.  Foucault is another story.  I think he basically
<br>
distorts the facts to fit his theories and even hides these behind dense
<br>
prose.  Of course, I'm reading him in translation, but that goes for Camus
<br>
too.:)  I have yet to get to Lyotard or a host of other thinkers...
<br>
<p>To stick with Foucault, read Karl von Schriltz's &quot;Foucault on the Prison:
<br>
Torturing History to Punish Capitalism&quot; (in _Critical Review_ 13(3-4), the
<br>
current issue on newstands now).  Focusing on _Discipline and Punish_, von
<br>
Schriltz shows how Foucault &quot;reconfigure[s] history&quot; to support his
<br>
assumptions.
<br>
<p>I think there is some certainty in these areas, but it has to be worked at.
<br>
Or, better, one can at least find out the wrong way to do things.  I think
<br>
it was Georges Clemenceau who responded to the idea of uncertainty and
<br>
relativism in history with something like, &quot;We might not be able to tell
<br>
what caused World War One, but anyone who claims Belgium invaded Germany is
<br>
quite wrong.&quot;  (This applies to political philosophy as well and not just
<br>
because history should inform political thought.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For me, it all comes back to Hume, and the unbridgeable gap between the Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Ought. One can prove the Is, but the Ought is always, at root, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leap of faith. If you have an airtight reason why your idea about the Good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is better than mine, I'd love to hear it.
</em><br>
<p>What about the bridge offered by Rand in her and Nathaniel Branden's _The
<br>
Virtue of Selfishness_?
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
