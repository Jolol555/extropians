</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;There are... many people who believe literally that the notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; biological evolution is the work of the devil...  I remain convinced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that their unrelenting hatred of the very idea of evolution stems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from their concept of morality:  where morals come from, and why people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behave in a moral fashion (when they do).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         I can't figure out how creationists can make this kind of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument.  It is so completely twisted and backwards.
</em><br>
<p>Here's another quote from the same book (_The Triumph of Evolution and
<br>
the Failure of Creationism_ by Niles Eldredge).  In this case, Eldredge
<br>
is quoting an editorial from the _New York Times_ (in Chapter 7, &quot;Can We
<br>
Afford a Culture War?&quot;):
<br>
<p>&quot;In the culture wars, you can credit [House Republican Whip Tom] DeLay
<br>
for turning a major political axiom upside down.  It used to be an article
<br>
of faith for conservatives that Americans need to take more individual
<br>
responsibility for their actions.  But now, thanks to Mr. DeLay, we learn
<br>
that violence perpetrated by gun owners is really the product of larger
<br>
forces.  What might those be?  According to the Republican whip from
<br>
Texas, nothing less than 'broken homes,' day care, television, video
<br>
games, birth control, abortion, and, unbelievably, the teaching of
<br>
the theory of evolution.&quot;  (lead editorial, Sunday, June 20, 1999,
<br>
p. 14 in the _New York Times, Week in Review_)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;         Yet, if we evolved from lower life forms, yet so many of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are still able to achieve the high level of morality they do, that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most fantastic thing of all.
</em><br>
<p>WYATT:  Well now, if you don't believe in religion, and you don't; and
<br>
if you don't, on the whole, think much of the assorted rules thrown
<br>
up by taboo morality, do you believe in any system of ethics?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  Yes, but it's very difficult to separate ethics altogether
<br>
from politics.  Ethics, it seems to me, arises in this way:  a man
<br>
is inclined to do something which benefits him and harms his neighbor.
<br>
Well, if it harms a good many of his neighbors, they will combine
<br>
together and say, &quot;Look, we don't like this sort of thing; we
<br>
will see to it that it **doesn't** benefit the man.&quot;  And that leads
<br>
to the criminal law.  Which is perfectly rational:  it's a method
<br>
of harmonizing the general and private interest.
<br>
<p>WYATT:  But now, isn't it, though, rather inconvenient if
<br>
everybody goes about with his own kind of private system of
<br>
ethics, instead of accepting a general one?
<br>
<p>RUSSELL:  It would be, if that were so, but in fact they're not
<br>
so private as all that because, as I was saying a moment ago,
<br>
they get embodied in the criminal law and, apart from the
<br>
criminal law, in public approval and disapproval.  People don't
<br>
like to incur public disapproval, and in that way, the
<br>
accepted code of morality becomes a very potent thing.

<em>&gt; &gt; &quot; ...is God unable to prevent suffering and thus not omnipotent? or

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         This is the plain and simple truth which even a child can

</em><br>
<p>I fancy God as a sort of Alice Krige horror-film character:
<br>
&quot;No vegetables, no dessert.  Those are the Rules.&quot;, not because ve's
<br>
necessarily a meanie, but because those are indeed The Rules.
