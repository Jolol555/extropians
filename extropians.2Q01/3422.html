<p>While Kurzweil should sometimes lay off his glass pipe,

he's right on the money on this one. Evolutionary selection

of edge autoreplicators does imply intelligence is expansive,

though hugging the lightcone front is asking for a lot.

Anyway, we should see lots of datapoints for rare Earth, soon,

or I'll publicly eat my mouse.

time soon.
