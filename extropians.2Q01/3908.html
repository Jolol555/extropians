<p>Agree here. Not quite, actually, because nanotechnology could introduce
<br>
a substrate that actually restructures itself adaptively, dynamically.
<br>
For instance, one could implement some rarely changing control circuits 
<br>
in bucky circuitry, which would be more efficient than computronium
<br>
for that specific, rarely but changing task.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and complexity of the *data* that matters, which is why one should be able
</em><br>
<p>I'm kinda missing the word &quot;speed&quot; here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to do AI on just about any reasonable piece of silicon.  There is no magic
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. Reasonable as to &quot;number of bits&quot; and &quot;speed of tweakage of said bits&quot;,
<br>
yes. Silicon does imply photolithography, and photolithography does
<br>
imply a certain structure size, flatland, and Moore saturating on that
<br>
substrate in about a decade. 
<br>
<p>So, I disagree with the silicon part of &quot;reasonable piece of silicon&quot;.
<br>
I would rather use the more neutral word &quot;substrate&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in evolvable hardware, it is simply a fast way of evolving data interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could be done completely in software on a boring von Neumann machine.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but an AI which takes a MYear to say &quot;Hello, world!&quot; is perhaps not
<br>
very recognizable as an AI, especially given that you can't assess the
<br>
AIness of a precursor, if it's impractically slooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
<br>
If I want to replay one GYear of evolution in practical time, I obviously need
<br>
something which is a great deal faster than realtime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hardware and software are equivalent things; hardware is faster, software is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheaper, and you balance the two depending on the specifications of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project at hand.
</em><br>
<p>Basically, you don't balance very much, for most current purposes hardware
<br>
is a constant. If you want the most of crunch these days it means investing
<br>
in air conditioning and a hall full of PCs, and a large number of fat switches.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Give me just one example of something you can do in high-plasticity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolvable hardware that can't be done in software.
</em><br>
<p>Speed, of course. That was easy.
