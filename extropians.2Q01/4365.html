<p>&lt;&lt; My meaning was that there may BE no &quot;long term.&quot; We'll be 
<br>
&nbsp;extraordinarily fortunate to stagger through another century. &gt;&gt;
<br>
I understand your suggestion of many threats to human and biotic existence, 
<br>
be a Spike or a Nuke or Global Warming or whatever.  
<br>
<p>We may indeed wind up in the shit can of annihilation, but that has been 
<br>
pimped before by many journalists and Paul Ehrlich in the Population Bomb, 
<br>
the Club or Rome, and the rest, including neonazi survivalists of the 1980s 
<br>
and such.  I would suggest that the human species will survive, and that it 
<br>
may, well, have to deal with problems, that have to do with dealing with 
<br>
&quot;Skynet scenarios.&quot;
<br>
<p>I hold with George Dyson's more convivial view that we will be part of what 
<br>
makes SIAI work, but it will take astronomically, more computational power, 
<br>
then even Kurzweil has suggested. For example; look how much computer 
<br>
capability have increased over the last 20 years, and it is having an impact, 
<br>
but nothing that has approached the science fiction of a William Gibson, or a 
<br>
Bruce Sterling.  
<br>
<p>We do suck at environmentally friendly technology for energy and using raw 
<br>
materials. That is largely a part of the marketplace, and how it interweaves 
<br>
with human psychology. Why split water for hydrogen fuel cells, if gasoline 
<br>
is so cheap (circa 2000)?  Why make hydrogen fuel cells, if the old, IC 
<br>
engine is the only thing to drive? You get the idea, its all linked.
<br>
<p>Pessimism as such, seems to be worse for a society, especially a democracy 
<br>
(republic) then optimism. People who are pessimistic settle for less and are 
<br>
less critical of their &quot;leadership.&quot; People can also turn to psychotic types 
<br>
of leadership, out of a sense of desperation.
<br>
<p>I think what is needed is honesty, less bullshit from journalists and 
<br>
scientists and promoters of this or that. Or if they are promoters of X or Y, 
<br>
let them state it clearly.
<br>
Peter Jennings is happy to editorialize (American Broadcasting Company) while 
<br>
he reads the news. Verification of what he claims, is often a harder matter 
<br>
to obtain.
<br>
We need honesty to make good choices.
