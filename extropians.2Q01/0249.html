</em><br>
<em>&gt; it certainly doesn't rise above the level of &quot;midcult&quot;).  If I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had kids, I would probably adopt a laissez-faire approach just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep life livable, sharing with them as many of the things I liked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as they showed a taste for, and leaving the rest to chance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public school system.  But not without a twinge of guilt.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it looks like there's a solution earlier in your post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; because its high-gloss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professionalism, like the taste of refined sugar compared to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a piece of fruit, cannot compete with the cruder product
</em><br>
<p>So, get your kids hooked on &quot;the cruder product&quot;.  Get them to at least
<br>
try writing a few stories of their own, so they can appreciate from
<br>
personal experience the better-written stories, no matter what media
<br>
(TV, movies, classic books, freebie texts on the 'Net) they come in.
<br>
Then sit back and watch the systems evolve towards the criteria you set
<br>
them up to favor.
<br>
<p>(Side note: you know you've been doing too much AI when you say it that
<br>
way.  ^_^;;;)
