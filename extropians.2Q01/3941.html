&nbsp;&nbsp;It's as Eliezer (usually) never tires of stating:  explicit emotions
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; where goes intelligence must go certain kinds of survival attitudes......
</em><br>
But artificial intelligence
<br>
<em>&gt; isn't necessarily evolved in the way that natural intelligence is, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need not have such capabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a very good point and possibly event true. Nevertheless interacting
<br>
with such
<br>
an intelligence will truely be a very alien experience and as such the value
<br>
of such intercourse
<br>
would be very limited indeed. This is the reason designers around the world
<br>
from basic
<br>
consumer software to robots are trying to make them &quot;human&quot; so that we feel
<br>
more comfortable
<br>
interacting with them, thus deriving more value from the experience.
