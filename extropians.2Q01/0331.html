</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative uses like bathing in asses' milk, we can take a stab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at estimating the maximum food consumption our civilization can ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demand. (We can even estimate the maximum demand in event of massive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compulsory extravagence -- everyone bathes three times a day in cognac
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and stuffs themselves silly on steak, while taking skiing lessons on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a butter mountain.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we hit a point where supply outstrips demand, then prices are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fall as suppliers fight each other for market share. But sooner or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later the suppliers reach an equilibrium point where they can't afford
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cut prices further (and remain in business).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The logical end-point is that once we have saturated the market for food,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and once prices have deflated at the lowest level that will support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any producers, there is simply *no* scope for economic growth left in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that field unless we manufacture more consumers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What part of &quot;there is a limit to how much food I can eat and how cheaply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be produced&quot; don't you agree with?
</em><br>
<p>No disagreement. What you are describing is a commodity market, which is
<br>
what milk and most other foods are because they are ubiquitous,
<br>
generally identical among producers, and almost identically priced.
<br>
Economic growth doesn't mean hiring more workers, it means producing the
<br>
most possible with the least workers possible with the given technology,
<br>
and advancing technology allows further reductions in labor or other
<br>
costs.
<br>
<p>However, assuming that there is absolutely no potential for further
<br>
growth is rather ignorant. BGH, for example, shows that growth is
<br>
possible in the milk market. I posit that vat grown milk will hit the
<br>
markets within 5 years at a price at least half that of cow-produced
<br>
milk, if not less (it all depends on the relative efficiency of bacteria
<br>
versus cow udders). Lets, for example, imagine a photosynthetic algae
<br>
that produces milk from water, CO2, O2 and trace elements. Such a
<br>
development should make milk acceptable to vegans, and you should be
<br>
able also to produce tailor made milk for lactose intolerant
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>Achieve this and the inefficiencies of the intermediary (the cow), and
<br>
you will gain immense economic growth overall, not because of increasing
<br>
milk market size, (though you will get that, as there are billions of
<br>
people in the world who do not consume the recommended USRDA of milk,
<br>
mostly because it is too expensive where they live), but because money
<br>
that would have been spent by consumers on milk can be redirected toward
<br>
other things, and the standard of living of more people rises due to
<br>
their ability to afford enough milk for their kids and themselves.
