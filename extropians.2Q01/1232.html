<p>Because the commie launch site is at 51.6 degrees latitude.

Ours is at about 27 degrees, Cape Canaveral.  The frogs
<br>
have one in Guianna at about 5 degrees.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And can we get some costs and molecular densities

</em><br>
<p>Yes I have good upper atmosphere model, part of
<br>
which was in the sheet I posted to Mike.  Let me
<br>
combine that one with the NOAA upper atmosphere
<br>
model and Ill offer it to whoever want it.

<p><em>&gt;  My read on some on the Shuttle pages that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; just because its higher or is that because we have it in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>We've given up some payload to have a 51 degree
<br>
orbit.  Also the station is high enough to not be
<br>
dragged down to quickly by atmospheric drag.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arriane 5 -- does that have an greater or lesser cost than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Shuttle or the Proton on lifting mass to the ISS?
</em><br>
<p>The shuttle is currently the most expensive ride available,
<br>
but it is man-rated.  spike
