It may be quite a while before we go plugging things into our brains. It's
<br>
hard (brains are complex), it's dangerous (elective neurosurgery anyone?),
<br>
and who wants to be stuck with the neuro-jack equivalent of Betamax?
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, we will continue to become less geographical in outlook. People
<br>
will do many more things from a physical distance, although the concept of
<br>
being far (tele) will drift away, as our communication technology improves.
<br>
You may be working with someone on the other side of the planet, but if you
<br>
have a video conference wall screen, surround sound, and highly
<br>
sophisticated groupware with which to communicate, you are not going to
<br>
*feel* far. All that's still without considering true virtual environments;
<br>
the helmet-gloves-etc full immersion scenario.
<br>
<p>I think you'll find that, by the time we begin to seriously contemplate
<br>
direct neural interfaces, we'll already be a long way down the path to
<br>
complete reliance on information systems for most aspects of our lives.
<br>
We'll already have been through multiple security-related crises, as
<br>
successive steps toward total immersion are made, and the subsequent new
<br>
environments are violated. In fact, we've already been through many such
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>At this point in time, people are moving en-masse from intermittent access
<br>
to the net, to permanent connection, and are feeling the pain, en-masse,
<br>
associated with that. So we see products like firewalls becoming a
<br>
mainstream software consumable; Windows XP apparently will come with a
<br>
firewall built in (scary...). We'll be having a lot more security problems,
<br>
a lot more accidents, a lot more catastrophes... but on the whole, people
<br>
will learn, and the technology will advance, and in general it'll be an
<br>
improvement, just as where we are now, in relation to
<br>
information/communication technology, is an undoubted improvement on 20
<br>
years ago, 10 years ago.
<br>
<p>A further point... if you haven't come across the concept of technological
<br>
singularity, then it's time to check it out... grab The Spike, by Damien
<br>
Broderick, as an excellent starting point. I'd say that, by the time we have
<br>
direct neural interfaces, we are going to be existing in an environment that
<br>
I might euphemistically call &quot;dynamic&quot;.
<br>
<p>To the car scenario you outline below... I think there are a number of
<br>
things to think about in relation to it...

<p><p><em>&gt; I don't necessarily think that neurotechnology is a bad thing.  It'd be
</em><br>
nice to have a datajack port installed in my car and another in my head so
<br>
that I could mentally drive it to class and be able to eat breakfast on the
<br>
way there with both hands free, instead of having to skip it or multitask
<br>
between dodging pedestrians or eating my sandwich.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Such an interface would probably also decrease the number of accidents,
</em><br>
since it takes less time to merely think about stopping your car than it
<br>
does to think about it, then wait for the action potential to go down your
<br>
leg to your foot, which will then press a gas pedal.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Cars, as we think of them now, will likely not exist by the time we are
<br>
plugging things into our heads. I would expect that travel will be less
<br>
important in general, and that the cars will drive themselves, by that point
<br>
(I damned hope they do; if they are still killing great swathes of people in
<br>
twenty years, it'll be even sadder than it is now). It may be that transport
<br>
degenerates to a public infrastructure of smart vehicles, summonable on
<br>
demand, by that point (particularly in the cities). Psychologically, the
<br>
grip of the car may lessen as we no longer need it as much, and as it
<br>
becomes automated to the point of not being the extension of ourselves that
<br>
once it was.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;    I could probably also listen to the radio with such a device, and also
</em><br>
mentally chat on a cell phone with friends.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It would be odd to use a neural interface to listen to the radio, or chat
<br>
with friends on the cellphone. Ears work pretty well! It might be an
<br>
advantage to be able to synthesise the contents of our aural scratch space
<br>
(the inner voice) and pump it into a cellphone, so one could think instead
<br>
of speak.. although it would require some mighty self-discipline; direct
<br>
broadcast of thoughts is not something I'd go for in a hurry.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, new forms of mind-mind communication may become possible
<br>
with neural interfaces, depending on what they interface with and how they
<br>
work. That would be interesting to hook up to a wireless data connection!
<br>
You'd want your car to drive itself, however; I can't imagine concentration
<br>
would be too crash hot if you were direct interfacing with someone. It
<br>
sounds a bit too personal for my tastes to do in public; a bit like mental
<br>
sex (something crass about midf*cking...). We might require considerable
<br>
social change (of the type that is likely to occur; breaking down of privacy
<br>
taboos) before applications like that could truly take off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   On the other hand, what if somebody messed with the signal inhibitor in
</em><br>
the port?  Suddenly, instead of normal volume, I'm blasted with a wave of
<br>
sound (all in my head, of course) so intense that I pass out from the shock,
<br>
and crash.  Or I'm bombarded with constant ads for products that I can't
<br>
turn off, short of disconnecting the port.  Maybe even then, it won't be
<br>
able to get rid of it, if you listen to a song long enough, it gets stuck in
<br>
your head, after all.  You find yourself humming it, even when you dont want
<br>
to.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What if someone shoots you in the face? Or punctures the wheel of your car?
<br>
Or sabotages the volume control of your radio? Or gives you ad-ware that
<br>
harrasses you constantly about crap product X?
<br>
<p>Sure, there are dangers. But hacking into systems is not like a shadowrun
<br>
stat; you don't throw a number of six-siders equal to your stat, and succeed
<br>
if you get enough fives &amp; sixes. It's not like the movies...
<br>
<p>The problems of potential mind-control attempts by commercial entities? I'd
<br>
probably take that quite seriously. The open source folks may have some
<br>
things to say on this score. Certainly, once things start going directly
<br>
into our heads, and we are considering crossing the line between biological
<br>
human, and completely technologically dependent transhuman (to the extent
<br>
that maybe we die without our modifications in place), informed people will
<br>
want to be very, very clear about what is being made part of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    Security in neurotechnology, and the prevention of it's abuse, it going
</em><br>
to be 100 times more important than security in the computer industry, which
<br>
is pretty damn imporant.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nanotech is as scary as it is interesting. I think the best personal
<br>
strategy is to watch it closely now, and try to get involved with it when it
<br>
starts to become viable. Being informed is going to be extremely important
<br>
as these new technologies emerge.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;    And with all these viruses, and all the bugs with Windows, etc, etc...
</em><br>
well, we've *seen* just how secure computers are.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Now imagine the same level of buggyness in something &lt;i&gt;directly wired
</em><br>
to your brain&lt;/i&gt;.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -Manny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Software's going to be pretty different by then; handcoding may be a very
<br>
much smaller part of it, for instance. However, I will agree with your point
<br>
to this extent.. an internet that evolves into a sophisticated, shared
<br>
mental space, is going to see some really interesting nastiness. It'll be
<br>
absolutely fascinating, the things that competing people do to try to seize
<br>
control or retain control in such an environment. We live in interesting
<br>
times, and move toward even more interesting ones. The spike, such as it
<br>
eventually is, will probably be most visible in it's early stages in that
<br>
space.
<br>
<p>Drooling in anticipation...
