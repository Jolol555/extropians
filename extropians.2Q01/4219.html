</em><br>
<p>I don't see any arguments for that conclusion.  You show that
<br>
rational Bayesians should agree if and only if that's true.  The assumption
<br>
is outrageously false; it requires that prior differ only due to valid
<br>
reasoning based on the evidence of the beliefs themselves.  Human
<br>
uninformed beliefs are caused by developmental, genetic, and memetic
<br>
processes that have essentially nothing to do with the truth of such 
<br>
things in the real world.  The reason my mother and I differ on the 
<br>
existence of God has nothing to do with the existence of God.
<br>
<p>In addition, it's an odd &quot;norm&quot;, at least for humans.  We have the priors
<br>
we have; to change them requires violating Bayesianism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I do *not* assume that everyone has the same uberprior,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually, but I do describe plausible constraints on such uberpriors that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imply common priors.
</em><br>
<p>You assume everybody agree on world_state_function/belief_state and
<br>
on probability(belief_state).  It's trivial to derive a 
<br>
belief-state-independent
<br>
world state function (i.e. a prior) just by averaging 
<br>
world_state_function/belief_state
<br>
by probability(belief_state).  So you do assume everybody has the same
<br>
uberprior.
<br>
<p>I would actually split your above assumption into two parts; one, that 
<br>
everybody
<br>
has the same uberprior, and two, that everybody agrees on the evidential
<br>
status of beliefs.  The two assumptions are quite independent, and putting
<br>
them this way makes it easier to discern how most people would address 
<br>
the issue.  Rational people understand that uninformed beliefs are minimally
<br>
informative about the world and so effectively agree on the evidential status
<br>
of beliefs; hence they disagree on the uberprior. phrased
<br>
as &quot;what would you expect the world to be like if you didn't exist&quot;.  My 
<br>
mother
<br>
thinks God would exist even if she didn't; I think if I weren't here God still
<br>
wouldn't either.  Ditto for differences on this group on the appropriate value
<br>
of Cisco stock, plausibility of friendly AI, etc.
