<em>&gt;   What about setting up a real money idea futures some place

<em>&gt; like sealand?  Would there be problems with this?
</em><br>
<p>Foresight institute is running a private real-money version of Idea Futures 
<br>
(using the same software as ideosphere.com).  My goal has been to move 
<br>
toward greater participation, while maintaining a socially valuable 
<br>
appearance so we can progressively open the market up to a larger audience. 
<br>
&nbsp;Prices are visible at <a href="http://nanodot.org/if/Prices">http://nanodot.org/if/Prices</a>.
<br>
<p>My reason for keeping it in the country, and pushing for above-board status 
<br>
is that I want the market to eventually become something that one could 
<br>
bring up in public policy debates.  &quot;According to the Idea Futures market, 
<br>
the oceans may be rising, but at nowhere near the rate you postulate.&quot;  &quot;If 
<br>
you're sure private space will never succeed, why haven't you backed up 
<br>
your opinions with your bank account in the market where the public odds 
<br>
are set?&quot;
<br>
<p>If the only real money IF markets are off-shore, the easy rejoinder is 
<br>
&quot;that's illegal.&quot;  End of argument.
<br>
<p>If someone wants to set up another market with a different goal, offshore 
<br>
works just fine.  But it's harder to describe the results as representing 
<br>
consensus views if many people consider it illegal.
