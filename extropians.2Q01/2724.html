If you would like to find out more about recent discussions on creating an 
<br>
open source seed AI and the public reaction to the Singularity and how the 
<br>
SIAI should handle the media see the recent archives of the SL4 mailing list.
<br>
<p><a href="http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/current/">http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/current/</a>
<br>
<p>Hope that helps,

<br>
<p>PS-apologies if you are already a member. Couldn't find any recent postings 
<br>
by you.

<em>&gt;Eliezer: having built complex systems myself, I say that putting all

</em><br>
<em>&gt;detailed for someone other than yourself to actually build the system -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a practical prerequisite to actually building what you propose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Granted, in theory one could do it by oneself.  In practice, that leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to practically infinite development times for complex projects, i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the job does not ever get finished.  On the other hand, putting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information up and letting others work on it will lead to faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completion - even if (as sometimes happens) putting your thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;together enough that you can honestly say others can write from it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forces you to put your thoughts together enough that *you* can write
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from it, whereas keeping it all in your own head allows the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-deception that you have it organized enough.  (I have been guilty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of this myself, in some of my earlier works that are now so thoroughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abandoned there's not even anything to point to.)  Even if you only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have partially complete notes, put them up - that way other people, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself, can *far* more easily see exactly what is missing, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary to fill in the gaps.  (As an example, consider the purpose of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things like Sourceforge.  Or, if you want something from my own past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider the plasma engine calculator I posted here: there were flaws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in my calculations - creds to anyone who wishes to go back in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;archives and check, check the power-to-heat equation first - but I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not see them until I'd posted it; even though, as it turned out, no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else found the error, or at least found it and told me about it.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sorry if this comes across as a flame; it is not meant that way.  Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system has promise, but I would like to see it made into reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead of being forever a dream.  Keeping the development
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specifications (as opposed to the grand plan) to yourself is highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unlikely to make the system real.  This is more important now that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have this level of publicity; you may get contacts over the next few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;days that, if given *all* the details you have *quickly* (not delayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for weeks), may be able to make it real - and might well be the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shot your project will get at reality within the next several years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me emphasize that last point: how you handle the sudden interest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your project could, by itself, potentially make the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Singularity around 2005-2010 with Friendly AI, and a Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around 2030 or later with unFriendly AI.  (This is the type of thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ads a few years ago meant by &quot;the power of one&quot;.)  Granted, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just potential - single digit, at best, percent chances either way -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it ain't zero chance, given what you've got already.  (Though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must admit the chances against are higher than the chances for, I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still hope for the best.)
</em><br>
<p>Like computer viruses, successful mind viruses will tend to be hard for 
<br>
their victims to detect. If you are the victim of one, the chances are that 
<br>
you won't know it, and may even vigorously deny it.         Richard Dawkins
