Perhaps my mathematical education was neither abstract nor thorough
<br>
enough but this article looks to me to be making a great todo about
<br>
relatively little. In particular I find many of its stabs at the
<br>
implications to be utterly unjustified by the rest of the article'ss
<br>
contents.  It looks like sensationalism and bad science reporting.  
<br>
<p>Would someone like to take a go at a more seasoned evaluation of this
<br>
piece?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mathematics has always been considered free of uncertainty and able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide a pure foundation for other, messier fields of science. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maths is just as messy, Chaitin says: mathematicians are simply acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on intuition and experimenting with ideas, just like everyone else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zoologists think there might be something new swinging from branch to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branch in the unexplored forests of Madagascar, and mathematicians have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunches about which part of the mathematical landscape to explore. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject is no more profound than that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Give me a break.  I have done enough mathematics to know that while
<br>
mathematical exploration can be messy and intuitive it is not subject to
<br>
being dismissed as not profound for all of that.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The reason for Chaitin's provocative statements is that he has found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the core of mathematics is riddled with holes. Chaitin has shown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are an infinite number of mathematical facts but, for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most part, they are unrelated to each other and impossible to tie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together with unifying theorems. If mathematicians find any connections
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between these facts, they do so by luck. &quot;Most of mathematics is true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for no particular reason,&quot; Chaitin says. &quot;Maths is true by accident.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In what sense are they &quot;facts&quot; or of any importance if not tied to
<br>
anything else at all?   If he is saying mathematical discovery is not
<br>
mechanical, this is certainly true.  But it is a jump to imply it is
<br>
thus not meaningful or is accidental.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is particularly bad news for physicists on a quest for a complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and concise description of the Universe. Maths is the language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, so Chaitin's discovery implies there can never be a reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;theory of everything&quot;, neatly summarising all the basic features of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality in one set of equations. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steven Weinberg, a Nobel prizewinning physicist and author of Dreams of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Final Theory, has swallowed it. &quot;We will never be sure that our final
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory is mathematically consistent,&quot; he admits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is more bad scientific poetry.  A TOE is not a complete and concise
<br>
description of the entire universe except in some quite delimited
<br>
sense.   Chaitin's work or the vague intuitions of it presented here do
<br>
not in the least justify a claim that a TOE is impossible. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin's mathematical curse is not an abstract theorem or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impenetrable equation: it is simply a number. This number, which Chaitin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls Omega, is real, just as pi is real. But Omega is infinitely long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and utterly incalculable. Chaitin has found that Omega infects the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mathematics, placing fundamental limits on what we can know. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega is just the beginning. There are even more disturbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers--Chaitin calls them Super-Omegas--that would defy calculation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if we ever managed to work Omega out. The Omega strain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incalculable numbers reveals that mathematics is not simply moth-eaten,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is mostly made of gaping holes. Anarchy, not order, is at the heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is ridiculous.  The article tells us almost nothing about such
<br>
numbers up to this point except supposed implications that we are, one
<br>
assumes, to take on faith in the mystery of higher mathematics.  There
<br>
is nothing at all that shows the existence of this class of numbers as
<br>
more than an intellectual abstraction of dubious applicability in the
<br>
entire piece.  On the face of it I would be surprised if you could
<br>
rigorously show the existence of such a beast without making it somewhat
<br>
calculable. It looks like a philosophical thought experiment run amok. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin discovered Omega and its astonishing properties while wrestling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with two of the most influential mathematical discoveries of the 20th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century. In 1931, the Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel blew a gaping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole in mathematics: his Incompleteness Theorem showed there are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical theorems that you just can't prove. Then, five years later,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British mathematician Alan Turing built on Gödel's work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, no Godel didn't do any such thing (&quot;blew a gaping hope in
<br>
mathematics&quot;) or at least not with what are popularly thought to be the
<br>
implications.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Using a hypothetical computer that could mimic the operation of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine, Turing showed that there is something that can never be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computed. There are no instructions you can give a computer that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enable it to decide in advance whether a given program will ever finish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its task and halt. To find out whether a program will eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halt--after a day, a week or a trillion years--you just have to run it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wait. He called this the halting problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but it certainly does not mean that all programming is meaningless
<br>
or unpredictable or that all working programs are lucky hits in a 
<br>
Sargaso Sea of unintelligble binary jumble.  Although in practice it
<br>
often feels that way. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Decades later, in the 1960s, Chaitin took up where Turing left off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fascinated by Turing's work, he began to investigate the halting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem. He considered all the possible programs that Turing's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothetical computer could run, and then looked for the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a program, chosen at random from among all the possible programs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will halt. The work took him nearly 20 years, but he eventually showed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this &quot;halting probability&quot; turns Turing's question of whether a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program halts into a real number, somewhere between 0 and 1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin named this number Omega. And he showed that, just as there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no computable instructions for determining in advance whether a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will halt, there are also no instructions for determining the digits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega. Omega is uncomputable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So what?  It is a simple restatement of the halting problem.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An unknowable number wouldn't be a problem if it never reared its head.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But once Chaitin had discovered Omega, he began to wonder whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have implications in the real world. So he decided to search
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics for places where Omega might crop up. So far, he has only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked properly in one place: number theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number theory is the foundation of pure mathematics. It describes how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with concepts such as counting, adding, and multiplying. Chaitin's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search for Omega in number theory started with &quot;Diophantine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equations&quot;--which involve only the simple concepts of addition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiplication and exponentiation (raising one number to the power of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another) of whole numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin formulated a Diophantine equation that was 200 pages long and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had 17,000 variables. Given an equation like this, mathematicians would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normally search for its solutions. There could be any number of answers:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps 10, 20, or even an infinite number of them. But Chaitin didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look for specific solutions, he simply looked to see whether there was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite or an infinite number of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He did this because he knew it was the key to unearthing Omega.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mathematicians James Jones of the University of Calgary and Yuri
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matijasevic of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in St Petersburg had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown how to translate the operation of Turing's computer into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diophantine equation. They found that there is a relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the solutions to the equation and the halting problem for the machine's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program. Specifically, if a particular program doesn't ever halt, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular Diophantine equation will have no solution. In effect, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equations provide a bridge linking Turing's halting problem--and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin's halting probability--with simple mathematical operations, such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the addition and multiplication of whole numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, so you can build a mapping.  But it is another thing to say that
<br>
mapping implies things true in one domain are true in the other without
<br>
more evidence than just such a mapping.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin had arranged his equation so that there was one particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variable, a parameter which he called N, that provided the key to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding Omega. When he substituted numbers for N, analysis of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equation would provide the digits of Omega in binary. When he put 1 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place of N, he would ask whether there was a finite or infinite number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of whole number solutions to the resulting equation. The answer gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first digit of Omega: a finite number of solutions would make this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digit 0, an infinite number of solutions would make it 1. Substituting 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for N and asking the same question about the equation's solutions would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give the second digit of Omega. Chaitin could, in theory, continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever. &quot;My equation is constructed so that asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it has finitely or infinitely many solutions as you vary the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parameter is the same as determining the bits of Omega,&quot; he says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Chaitin already knew that each digit of Omega is random and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent. This could only mean one thing. Because finding out whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Diophantine equation has a finite or infinite number of solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generates these digits, each answer to the equation must therefore be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowable and independent of every other answer. In other words, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomness of the digits of Omega imposes limits on what can be known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from number theory--the most elementary of mathematical fields. &quot;If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomness is even in something as basic as number theory, where else is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it?&quot; asks Chaitin. He thinks he knows the answer. &quot;My hunch is it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere,&quot; he says. &quot;Randomness is the true foundation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is the leap of hyper-intellectual magical thinking, a mystic
<br>
correspondence between unlike things.  Perhaps it is my ignorance but
<br>
this does not strike me as terribly convincing.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The fact that randomness is everywhere has deep consequences, says John
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Casti, a mathematician at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vienna University of Technology. It means that a few bits of maths may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow from each other, but for most mathematical situations those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections won't exist. And if you can't make connections, you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve or prove things. All a mathematician can do is aim to find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little bits of maths that do tie together. &quot;Chaitin's work shows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solvable problems are like a small island in a vast sea of undecidable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propositions,&quot; Casti says.
</em><br>
<p>What justifies going from a 200 page specialized equation made just to
<br>
get this mystical correspondence to a claim that most mathematical
<br>
situations are utterly disconnected and random?  How is this more than
<br>
sensationalism?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take the problem of perfect odd numbers. A perfect number has divisors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose sum makes the number. For example, 6 is perfect because its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divisors are 1, 2 and 3, and their sum is 6. There are plenty of even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect numbers, but no one has ever found an odd number that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect. And yet, no one has been able to prove that an odd number can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be perfect. Unproved hypotheses like this and the Riemann hypothesis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has become the unsure foundation of many other theorems (New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientist, 11 November 2000, p 32) are examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things that should be accepted as unprovable but nonetheless true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chaitin suggests. In other words, there are some things that scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always have to take on trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>OK. I give up on this.  I have piddled with such unproved hypothesis
<br>
myself and I certainly do not believe that they are unprovable or
<br>
something to be taken on faith.
