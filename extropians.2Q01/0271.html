<em>&gt; From Brian D Williams.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw on NASDAQ that Abby Joseph Cohen from Goldman Sachs has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recommended to their customers with cash that this is a good time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to buy stocks. &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Warren Buffet must have been thinking about a market
<br>
like these days when he said:
<br>
&quot;I will tell you the secret of getting rich on Wall Street.
<br>
You try to be greedy when _others_ are fearful.
<br>
You try to be _very_ fearful when others are greedy.&quot;
<br>
But are _others_ fearful enough?
<br>

<p>Goldman Sachs' influential strategist Abby Joseph Cohen raised
<br>
her recommended equity exposure in a model portfolio to 70 percent
<br>
from 65 percent while reducing her cash position to zero from 5 percent.
<br>
Fixed-income exposure was unchanged at 27 percent, with most of the
<br>
exposure in intermediate bonds, including corporate issues.
<br>
<p>This is the strategist's first change since March 2000, when equity exposure
<br>
was reduced.
<br>
<p>Cohen said she's increasingly confident that a too-gloomy consensus scenario
<br>
is priced into share prices, encouraging the increase in recommended equity
<br>
exposure.
<br>
<p>&quot;We believe that attractive equity valuation has been restored and forecast
<br>
year-end 2001 prices levels of 1,650 and 13,000 for the S&amp;P and Dow
<br>
Industrials&quot; Cohen said in a note to clients.
<br>
<p>That represents a roughly 31 percent increase for the S&amp;P from current
<br>
levels and a roughly 22 percent gain for the Dow from current levels.
<br>
&quot;Many of the imbalances identified during the past year have now been
<br>
largely reduced. Risk tolerance has been replaced by risk aversion.
<br>
Moderate overvaluation of the S&amp;P 500 has been followed by notable
<br>
undervaluation&quot; Cohen commented.
<br>
<p>She expects the current economic slowdown to be followed by trend
<br>
growth rates in gross domestic product and profits - and not by an
<br>
intractable recession as the U.S. economy still benefits from favorable
<br>
trends, including a productive workforce, well-managed companies,
<br>
mild inflation and a large federal surplus.
<br>
<p>&quot;The upturn in growth in the coming months is unlikely to reach the
<br>
gregarious levels of late 1999, nor would these rapid rates be appealing.
<br>
Instead, trend rates for both GDP -- roughly 3 percent -- and S&amp;P EPS --
<br>
about 7 percent -- are more likely. These moderate rates are likely to be
<br>
sustainable,&quot; she said.
