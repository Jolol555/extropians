</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The &quot;outbreak&quot; of GERD is due to having expensive new drugs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;treat it. You've heard of it before when it was called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;heartburn&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;True. The newer terms sounds sexier
</em><br>
<p>Like most normal people I've had heartburn a time or two, in fact
<br>
like most electricians I've known, I used to get it so often that
<br>
we walked around with a pack of Tums in our pockets at all times.
<br>
<p>GERD is completely different, the first and second times I had a
<br>
severe attack I went to the emergency room positive I was having a
<br>
heart attack, the second time because I couldn't believe it was
<br>
&quot;heartburn&quot;. I ended up in a cardiac ward overnight, and had to
<br>
take a stress test (all normal). I was very sick for months after
<br>
both episodes.
<br>
<p>Nope, GERD is something completely different and it can be very
<br>
severe, it's not uncommon for sufferers to aspirate acid into their
<br>
lungs, which will cause you grief like you wouldn't believe. Long
<br>
term sufferers can develop asthma and esophageal cancer from it.
<br>
<p>The strange thing is that they don't really know what causes it,
<br>
The leading theory was that for some reason the lower esophageal
<br>
sphincter doesn't maintain proper pressure, but many of the most
<br>
severe cases (like mine formally) have a completely normal LES.
<br>
<p>Endoscopic exams (many) have revealed nothing unusual, except what
<br>
appears to be mild gastritis. I've participated in a couple of
<br>
studies, and the researchers admit they don't understand it.
<br>
<p>Nor is it H Pylori.
<br>
<p>The thing that got me curious was that a researcher said it looked
<br>
to him like I was having a reaction to an unknown substance.
<br>
<p>And yes, you can use Prilosec to treat heartburn, and very
<br>
effectively.
