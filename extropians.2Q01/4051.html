</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Now Hal had earlier written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The model of reversible computation I was using is due to Bennett
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Bennett-CH/NotHoRC.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Authors/Computing/Bennett-CH/NotHoRC.html</a>.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, sure enough, this article discusses the &quot;Brownian&quot; type 
<br>
reversible computer that Eugene and I had never heard of.  And,
<br>
of course, as Hal had inferred, it's a perfectly good way to
<br>
do reversible computing.  But it's not the only way.  You all
<br>
have surely read about the billiard-ball model, which Bennett
<br>
also discusses here.  This more familiar model proceeds in a 
<br>
linear trajectory, and is exactly what I had in mind when I
<br>
first raised this topic, and evidently what Eugene and Robin
<br>
had in mind as well when they responded.
<br>
<p>So for zero energy, Hal, and a possible resumption of our earlier
<br>
discussion, consider that by &quot;reversible computing&quot;, most people
<br>
are talking about something like the billiard ball model.
