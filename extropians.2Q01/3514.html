<p>I don't have to anthromorphize an &lt;insert Something Really Bad here,
<br>
such as a 100 km space rock impacting the top of your skull/two
<br>
vagrant neutron star deciding on fusing Somewhere Under Your Bed&gt; 
<br>
to infer it's going to make me very dead, whether with our without 
<br>
lots of spectacular pyrotechnics.
<br>
<p>What is it with you people, are you just generically unreasonable,
<br>
or do you habitually let your kids play russian roulette; or 
<br>
soccer on a minefield?
<br>
<p>I do not care what the AIs want, as long as they're something 
<br>
really big, fast, powerful, and growing exponentially, and having
<br>
-- even unbiased -- agendas of their own. And they will be that, very 
<br>
soon, if they're subject to evolutionary  constraints. Which seems 
<br>
about the only bit of prejudice I have. 
<br>
<p>I don't even have to be absolutely 100.1% positive about it, as
<br>
long as I think there's a nonnegligable probability of Ragnar0k,
<br>
I just think it's a monumentally bad idea to attempt. Billie Joy
<br>
is right on the money on this one. Relinquishment, shmerlinquishment,
<br>
just hold the horses until we're ready.
<br>
<p>Is it too much too ask?
