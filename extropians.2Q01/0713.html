</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No decrement of freedom is involved.
</em><br>
<p>I can think of a reason to be nervous, at least.
<br>
<p>Presumably, the Sysop will need to be able to out-think any aggregated
<br>
subset of its clients, to make sure that no collusion or conspiracy
<br>
can subvert it.  To maintain control while permitting the growth
<br>
in total computational capacity that the clients are likely to
<br>
desire (either by increasing their individual capacity or their
<br>
numbers, or both) the Sysop will not be a static entity, but will
<br>
itself be self-enhancing, for a long time (forever, maybe, if it
<br>
can find a resource like the infinitely-extensible TVC grid in
<br>
Egan's _Permutation City_).
<br>
<p>The thing is, forever is such a long time!  What if the Sysop
<br>
mutates in some unforeseen way in this abyss of time, and
<br>
requires a mid-Eternity course correction?  The Sysop will always
<br>
be more rigid in one respect than the clients -- it will continue
<br>
to have to serve as their protector and mediator throughout all
<br>
time, unless of course it is programmed to cease operating after
<br>
all the clients have reached a certain level of development (or
<br>
even commit suicide, to ensure that **it** is not a threat to
<br>
the clients).  This smells like the sort of thing that
<br>
eventually sent HAL round the bend.  What if the Sysop starts
<br>
to get a little dotty?  Egan imagined something unforeseen like
<br>
this happening in Elysium, when the Lambertians got smart
<br>
enough to TOE the Elysians out of existence.
<br>
<p>So here are some concrete things that you might want to do that a
<br>
Sysop might or might not permit.  Could you gain direct control
<br>
of your own computronium (and go hang yourself with it, if you
<br>
wanted) by forking off your own universe and leaving the Sysop
<br>
and the other clients irrevocably behind?  Could you and a
<br>
friend go through the same escape hatch together?  Could the clients
<br>
unanimously decide to leave together and ditch the Sysop entity?
<br>
