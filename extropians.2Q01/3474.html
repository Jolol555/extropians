<br>
<p>GLOBAL ISCHEMIA: A COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION, PART I
<br>
<p>By Mike Darwin, CEO Kryos, Inc.
<br>
<p>WHAT IS ISCHEMIA
<br>
<p>Ischemia is the pathologic interruption of the delivery of adequate blood
<br>
flow to tissues. Unlike anoxia where only oxygen delivery is compromised,
<br>
ischemia constitutes a complete disruption of the normal functions of
<br>
blood flow: delivery of oxygen and nutrients and other molecules essential
<br>
to cellular survival as well as the removal of harmful byproducts of
<br>
metabolism. Ischemia can either be partial or complete, regional (as in
<br>
stroke), or global as in cardiac arrest.
<br>
<p>BACKGROUND
<br>
<p>In order to understand the implications of ischemia in the human
<br>
cryopreservation patient it is first desirable to understand ischemia in
<br>
the context of contemporary medicine.  Heart attack and stroke are likely
<br>
to be the pathologies that most clinicians cite as the principal cause of
<br>
ischemia. In fact, ischemia is the major underlying cause of most
<br>
mortality and morbidity in the critical care setting (ICU and Emergency
<br>
Department) in the Western world. Closed head injury, blunt force trauma,
<br>
shock and sepsis all have ischemia as the fundamental underlying common
<br>
pathway. All of these illnesses have their lessons to teach about the
<br>
pathophysiology mechanisms of ischemia.
<br>
<p>However, for purposes of clarity and relevance I will focus on global
<br>
ischemia secondary to cardiac arrest as a result of heart attack or
<br>
exsanguinating trauma. Of most immediate relevance to the cryopreservation
<br>
patient is ischemia secondary to sudden cardiac death (SCD) and the events
<br>
which follow failed or morbid resuscitation.
<br>
<p>EPIDEMIOLOGY
<br>
<p>Each year in the United States there are 540,000 deaths from myocardial
<br>
infarction (MI) [1] (with 350,000 of these deaths occurring before the
<br>
patient reaches the hospital) as a result of a non-perfusing arrhythmia,
<br>
principally ventricular fibrillation [2]. This mode of sudden cardiac
<br>
death (SCD) is also responsible for the majority of the 190,000
<br>
in-hospital deaths from MI, which typically occur within the first 24
<br>
hours following admission. [3]. Especially tragic is that 50% of these
<br>
deaths occur in persons ~50 years of age or less [4]. An estimated
<br>
additional 20,000 incidents of SCD occur as a result of asphyxiation,
<br>
drowning, electrocution, and genetic or developmental predisposition to
<br>
lethal arrhythmias (Wolf-Parkinson's White Syndrome, congenital thickening
<br>
of the intraventricular septum, and idiopathic arrhythmic disease) and
<br>
other non-atherosclerosis causes. This later category of SCD typically
<br>
occurs in individuals whose mean age is less than 25 [5].  At this time
<br>
the principal treatments for SCD consist of initiation of manual,
<br>
&quot;bystander&quot; cardiopulmonary resuscitation, so-called Basic Cardiac Life
<br>
Support (BCLS) followed by &quot;definitive&quot; treatment of the arrhythmia
<br>
beginning with defibrillation and the application of Advanced Cardiac Life
<br>
Support (ACLS) [6].
<br>
<p>ACLS consists of the application of an algorithm of manual CPR, electrical
<br>
defibrillation and pharmacologic therapy aimed at restoring a perfusing
<br>
cardiac rhythm and adequate blood pressure and cardiac output to sustain
<br>
life until definitive treatment of the underlying cause of the cardiac
<br>
arrest can be achieved (e.g., coronary revascularization, implantation of
<br>
an automatic defibrillator, or life-long anti-arrhythmic therapy) [6].
<br>
<p>The time to survival without neurological deficit following cardiac arrest
<br>
in the absence of BCLS declines rapidly following a sigmoid curve with
<br>
survival without neurological deficit being ~95% following 1 minute of
<br>
arrest time, and 0% following 9 minutes of arrest [7]. Put another way,
<br>
50% of patients will experience significant morbidity or death following 4
<br>
minutes of circulatory arrest.
<br>
<p>What is not shown in this table is that the effect of immediate bystander
<br>
CPR on survival is negligible in most studies [8, 9], with the primary
<br>
benefit being observed in patients who's time from the initiation of BCLS
<br>
to successful cardiac resuscitation was greater than 8 minutes [10]. There
<br>
is evidence in the literature that morbidity is improved with prompt
<br>
bystander CPR [11] providing that EMS response is also rapid, although
<br>
this remains controversial [10, 12]. A corollary of this is that the
<br>
overall survival rate following SCD, with, or without, serious
<br>
neurological morbidity ranges between 1% (New York City, NY) [13] to 17%
<br>
(Seattle, WA) [14]. The mean survival (defined as survival to discharge
<br>
from the hospital) in the United States as a whole is generally agreed to
<br>
be at best 15% [15] with ~70% of these patients experiencing lasting
<br>
neurological morbidity (ranging from &quot;mild&quot; cognitive impairment to total
<br>
incapacitation in the Persistent Vegetative State (PVS) [16-18].
<br>
<p>The primary cause of non-survival in patients experiencing SCD is failed
<br>
cardiac or cerebral resuscitation. Arguably, it is failed cerebral
<br>
resuscitation, since most underlying causes of refractory cardiac arrest
<br>
could be treated by &quot;bridging&quot; supportive technologies such as emergency
<br>
femoral-femoral cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) until myocardial
<br>
revascularization and hemodynamic stabilization is achieved [19]. When
<br>
this technology is applied to patients who are candidates for good
<br>
neurological outcome, the survival rate is increased [20-22]. These
<br>
technologies are not typically used on patients who are unsuccessfully
<br>
resuscitated (restoration of adequate cardiac rhythm and perfusion)
<br>
because of the justified perception that irreversible brain damage would
<br>
have occurred during the prolonged period of cardiac arrest or CPR/ACLS
<br>
[20]. Similarly, it is for this reason that most attempts to achieve
<br>
cardiopulmonary resuscitation in-hospital in patients who are not
<br>
hypothermic, or intoxicated with sedative drug are terminated following 15
<br>
minutes [23, 24].
<br>
<p>It is noteworthy that both past and current ACLS protocols contain no
<br>
drugs aimed at treating the primary cause of failed or morbid
<br>
resuscitation from SCD: principally post-ischemia-reperfusion
<br>
encephalopathy (Textbook of Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Second Edition,
<br>
AHA,1996).
<br>
<p><p>Over the past 15 years a vast number of therapeutic interventions have
<br>
shown great promise in animal models in the laboratory [25-28]. However,
<br>
none of these has been successfully applied clinically despite numerous
<br>
attempts [29, 30]. These reasons include: a) the inappropriateness of
<br>
animal models being used to validate pharmacologic or other means of
<br>
therapeutic intervention, b) failure to address the multifactorial nature
<br>
of the pathophysiology of ischemia-reperfusion injury, and c) the
<br>
inability to rapidly induce mild systemic hypothermia which, arguably, has
<br>
been shown to be one of the most potent interventions in achieving
<br>
improved outcome from prolonged periods of cardiac arrest and the
<br>
resulting normothermic systemic and, particularly, cerebral ischemia.
<br>
<p>In 1994, Critical Care Research, Inc. (Critical Care Research, then called
<br>
21st Century Medicine) of Rancho Cucamonga, CA began a program of research
<br>
to investigate the used of multimodal drug therapy combined with mild,
<br>
post resuscitative hypothermia (33 C-34 C). By Early 1996 Critical Care
<br>
Research was achieving routine recovery of dogs from ~17 minutes of
<br>
normothermic ischemia with 75% overall long term survival (&lt;3 months) with
<br>
less than 75% detectable neurological deficit in survivors. These
<br>
extraordinary results were achieved by a multimodal drug approach using a
<br>
slightly modified version of Safar, et al.'s model of CPB with
<br>
hemodilution and prompt institution of hypothermia to achieve initial
<br>
restoration of circulation and oxygenation [31-33].
<br>
<p>Neurobehavioral and histological evaluation of randomly selected survivors
<br>
from this study demonstrated no detectable deficits in 75% of the
<br>
surviving animals (exceptions were some neuronal loss in the cerebellum,
<br>
which was not associated with any demonstrable long-term disability, or
<br>
motor deficit).
<br>
<p>It is noteworthy that no other investigators have come close to
<br>
demonstrating these kinds of survival times following whole body
<br>
normothermic cardiac arrest in dogs with such low levels of neurological
<br>
deficit.
<br>
<p>Mortality Secondary to Massive Exsanguinating Trauma Resulting Cardiac
<br>
Arrest Before Tertiary Care Is Accessible
<br>
<p>Closely related in pathophysiology to prolonged normothermic ischemia
<br>
secondary to SCD is cardiac arrest secondary to exsanguinating trauma. It
<br>
is estimated that ~20,000 US civilians a year die as result of hemorrhage
<br>
from abdominal and thoracic injuries [36], or from poly-trauma. In
<br>
developing nations this problem is even more severe as a disproportionate
<br>
amount of trauma occurs in rural settings remote from tertiary care
<br>
facilities and with no helicopter or other airlift infrastructure
<br>
available to shorten this interval.
<br>
<p>Similarly, approximately 90% of the battlefield casualties who fail to
<br>
reach tertiary care facilities die from intractable hemorrhage during
<br>
transport. The US military under the auspices of DARPA is currently
<br>
funding a multimillion project to achieve ~30 minutes of battlefield
<br>
&quot;suspended animation&quot; using chilled, drug containing crystalloid
<br>
solutions, to solve this serious cause of war-related mortality [37].
<br>
<p><p>Cardiac arrest secondary to exsanguinating trauma offers a unique
<br>
opportunity for intervention in the pathophysiological cascade of
<br>
normothermic cardiac arrest. Because blood loss and deterioration of the
<br>
patient to the agonal state occur over a time course of minutes to an hour
<br>
or longer, it is possible to begin administration of systemic and
<br>
cerebroprotective drugs, inhibit the clotting cascade, and induce modest
<br>
hypothermia via the infusion of large quantities of chilled
<br>
volume-replacement solutions. Typically, 3-4 liters of crystalloid are
<br>
administered for each liter of blood lost. In situations where
<br>
exsanguination will result in cardiac arrest, such as fracture of the
<br>
liver, rupture of the spleen, and laceration of major vascular structures,
<br>
60% to 70% of the patient's blood volume will have been replaced with
<br>
crystalloid at a ratio of 3:1 prior to cardiac arrest. For a typical 70 kg
<br>
adult this would represent a volume of ~10 liters, which, if administered
<br>
chilled to 2 -4 C could be expected to reduce systemic (core) temperature
<br>
by ~3 -4 C, thus providing additional ischemic protection, transport time,
<br>
and time for surgical repair of the hemorrhagic lesion(s).
<br>
<p>The ability to administer large volumes of parenteral products of defined
<br>
electrolyte composition, containing multiple drugs, cellular edema
<br>
inhibiting polymers, and hemorheologic agents prior to the occurrence of
<br>
the insult (systemic ischemia) offers the opportunity to prevent many of
<br>
the foreseeable irreversible pathological events which occur during
<br>
ischemia as a result of SCD.
<br>
<p>Many of the therapeutic drugs which have proven effective in Critical Care
<br>
Research's pilot study of sudden cardiac arrest (prolonged systemic
<br>
ischemia) are likely to be far more effective if administered prior to the
<br>
insult, rather than after a prolonged period of ischemia. The ability to
<br>
induce a maximally effective degree of post-resuscitation hypothermia
<br>
during the insult period is yet another added advantage of this mode of
<br>
cardiac arrest.
<br>
<p>Thus, prolonged ischemic insult from either SCD or hemorrhagic cardiac
<br>
arrest are interrelated and lend themselves to integration into a single
<br>
protocol for investigation.
