Although the military not trained to believe it has the
<br>
responsibility of deciding when the Constitution has been violated, and The 
<br>
Supreme court has in fact stated that unconstitutional laws need not be 
<br>
obeyed, the Military powers are subordinate to the Civil powers.
<br>
<p>Question: What happens if those who are duly authorized to decide when the 
<br>
constitution has been violated are the violators themselves?
