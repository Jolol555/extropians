<p>The experiment is not supposed to last very long. This is just a 'proof
<br>
of concept' vehicle, to verify the amount of thrust generated for a
<br>
given area and to test the sail deployment mechanism. A more permanent
<br>
larger scale solar sail will launch later.
<br>
<p>As for anothers comment doubting an ICBM's ability to put a sat in
<br>
orbit: its a sub launched ICBM normally boosting multiple MIRVs which
<br>
weigh hundreds of pounds each. The sail test is supposed to be much much
<br>
lighter.
