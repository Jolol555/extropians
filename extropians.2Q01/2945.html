<p>Domdules had nothing to do with Flare.  It was an awkward term for what I
<br>
now would call a sensory modality.

</em><br>
<p>Quite a number of things.  User-supplied annotations do not have a truly
<br>
good or even passable access idiom - including annotation namespacing and
<br>
annotation metadata, for example - in any language of which I am aware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Attaching user supplied meta data to language constructs is trivial

<p>I program Python lately.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Take a look at the literate programming faq. Skim a decent Lisp text

</em><br>
<p>[et cetera et cetera]
<br>
<p>Actually, Matt, while I understand that your suggestions are well-meant
<br>
(lately I've come to realize that other people hypothesizing I have never
<br>
once thought of something blindingly obvious are simply expecting a
<br>
behavior that most people do in fact exhibit, not being personally
<br>
insulting), I did in fact go through several lists of the &quot;best of&quot; modern
<br>
languages back when I was writing my notes on Flare, looking for features
<br>
that I could skim off, and making sure I didn't miss something obvious. 
<br>
This included Haskell, Common LISP, Scheme, Smalltalk, Tcl, APL, and so
<br>
on, in addition to C++, Python, Perl, Java, Java VM, MOO, 680x0 assembly,
<br>
Forth, Pascal, Prolog, and all the other languages with which I was
<br>
already familiar at that time.
<br>
<p>There are things I expect to do in Flare that I will only be able to do
<br>
in, say, Python by badly reinventing Flare, like trying to write C++
<br>
programs in C.  Sure, you can implement your own virtual function tables,
<br>
but do you really want to?  Just having a picture in my mind of Flare has
<br>
already led me to write seriously different (and better) Python programs
<br>
with quick-and-dirty emulated Flare behaviors.  For example, the program
<br>
that I use to maintain my Webpages actually reads in fragments of Python
<br>
code from an XML file and organizes them using the attached attributes. 
<br>
Even without being able to use the debugger on those code fragments,
<br>
there's still been an improvement in programming speed just resulting from
<br>
more modular design.  &quot;Literate programming&quot; is just good writing and some
<br>
features for forced documentation, not any kind of annotative programming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I don't think though you appreciate what a enormous task
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   simply specifying a non-toy language would be or what it would take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to improve on the state of the art.
</em><br>
<p>It would take a small fragment of the knowledge of cognitive science that
<br>
it would take to specify a non-toy AI.  The fragment in question is
<br>
knowledge about how the human mind handles annotative thinking, just as
<br>
object-oriented programming is derived from a theory of how the human mind
<br>
processes objects.
<br>
<p>In other words, I dispute your implied belief that all the major &quot;wins&quot;
<br>
have been used up.  I've found a collection of design patterns in my
<br>
programming career that are very basic, language-type features, which I
<br>
have found to lead to incredibly more modular and adaptable code, and
<br>
which I have yet to find implemented in any existing programming language,
<br>
for all my browsing.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I see no good reason why you have a need to immediately
<br>
hypothesize anything about Flare one way or the other, rather than waiting
<br>
on further information.  Flare simply hasn't made it to the top of my
<br>
to-do list yet, in part because people like you keep asking me to write
<br>
documents, and a lot of those requests have a higher priority than Flare.
<br>
<p>I now politely request that you stop bugging me about this.
