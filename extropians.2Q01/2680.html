<p>You may want to know where the UK's Bill of Rights comes from. Basically,
<br>
one of the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty was that all EU members
<br>
signatory to the treaty must pass certain laws -- including enacting the
<br>
European Declaration of Human Rights into law. Previously, the UK
<br>
recognized the European Court as a highest court of appeal, and the
<br>
European Court recognized the HR declaration as binding, so people with
<br>
a human rights case in the UK had to go to the European Court. As this
<br>
took a decade on average, having the human rights law on the books 
<br>
in the UK seemed like a significant improvement.
<br>
<p>One problem is that the European Declaration of Human Rights is modelled
<br>
on (damn near identical to) the UN Declaration of Human Rights. Which is
<br>
sufficiently riddled with weasel clauses to satisfy any Macchiavellian
<br>
legislation: for example, the right to free speech comes with riders
<br>
about &quot;except where necessary for the defense of public health and morals&quot;,
<br>
whatever the hell that means. (I blame the 1950's, personally.) 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the Declaration hasn't been around anything like as long
<br>
as the US constitution, so although its built-in loopholes are broader,
<br>
there has been far less time for prosecutors to work out run-arounds. Ergo:
<br>
it protects less well, but is probably more easily enforced, at least for
<br>
the time being. 
<br>
<p>(I'm inclined to take it as an improvement on the status quo ante and
<br>
bang the drum for more. If nothing else watching the politicians run
<br>
around fulminating about how all their good work is going to be undone by
<br>
the Human Rights Act which will let pesky citizens nullify their laws
<br>
is most amusing.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have seen no clear evidence our society is getting more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permissive, altho it is certainly getting more transparent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't tell the UK is getting more permissive, altho I hear
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consequently Im still rethinking my notions.  spike
</em><br>

<br>
The UK is much less of a Christian society than the US. To put it in
<br>
perspective, only 14% of the population go to Church once a month or more
<br>
often; the most observant religious people in the UK are the moslems,
<br>
whose worshippers outnumber the Church of England devout (despite making
<br>
up only 2% of the population). Although the default entry on an English
<br>
birth certificate says &quot;Church of England&quot;, in reality only about 58%
<br>
profess any belief in *anything* vaguely religious, and of those the
<br>
vast majority believe in a new-agey numinous universal spirit kind of
<br>
thing. Only about 30% believe in the historical existence of a person
<br>
called Jesus, for example.
<br>
<p>One side effect of this is that the sort of policies the religious
<br>
right promote in the US fail to strike any kind of electoral chord over
<br>
here. We've recently seen the Prime Minister (himself a Christian) being
<br>
warned not to pander to religious institutions or voters for fear of
<br>
alienating the general population. Going back further, when Pat Robertson
<br>
set up a joint financial venture with the Bank of Scotland his position
<br>
on homosexuality and abortion caused such outrage that a major consumer
<br>
boycott started up within days: his strain of religiously-based politics
<br>
are seen as immoral in the UK, to the point that Outrage! and the Church
<br>
of Scotland were sharing a platform against him.
<br>
<p>As far as permissiveness goes, there's still a blue-nosed tendency in the
<br>
UK, but it seems to be generationally stratified. Religiosity is twice
<br>
as common among the over-65's as among the under 35's, for example. So
<br>
is opposition to decriminalisation of cannabis, or to gay rights. This
<br>
suggests that the UK is going to get markedly more permissive over the
<br>
next twenty years as the significance of the current grey generation's
<br>
voting pattern subsides.
<br>
<p>One case in point is teen pregnancy. The UK rate is about half that of
<br>
the US -- but double that of mainland Europe, and it's widely understood
<br>
that there's a direct correlation between explicit sex education in
<br>
schools and availability of contraceptives to teen agers and a lower teen
<br>
pregnancy rate. Nevertheless, we have a PM who wants to tell children that
<br>
&quot;virginity is cool&quot;; this statement was mocked by the press, but
<br>
doesn't seem to have cost him any votes -- there seems to be a disconnect
<br>
in the public mind where it comes to some hot-button issues.
<br>
<p>Long-term forecast: continued social liberalization (outside of core
<br>
religious groups), backlash protests by fringe groups (e.g. anti-
<br>
abortionists -- in the UK they *are* a fringe group), increasing political
<br>
centralisation and authoritarianism battling with increasingly effective
<br>
civil rights legislation. Think of it as slow-motion assimilation of
<br>
the social messages of the 1960's, a process that was arrested in 1979
<br>
by Thatcher but which has now resumed its impact on society.
