</em><br>
<p>You must have missed the last part. I get the feeling you simply went
<br>
and grabbed a quote to throw at me, without really examining it. The
<br>
last part says that benevolence implies a presumption of common moral
<br>
decencies. Well you have had that presumption on my part for some time
<br>
now, right up until the point where you actively began outright bashing
<br>
of Extropians. At that point you totally lost that presumption.
<br>
<p>You also conveniently cut off the stuff right before that quote that says
<br>
we do not see benevolence as an obligation to sacrifice our interests. I
<br>
certainly am not going to keep sacrificing list quality just to be nice to
<br>
you. You've worn out your welcome Marlow. Play nice or get out.
