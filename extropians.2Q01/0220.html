</em><br>
<p>Hmm...  Well, restricting one's definition of &quot;religion&quot; to the
<br>
elaborately codified ones of the historical era (the last 5000
<br>
years) seems a bit narrow.  A more anthropological view which includes,
<br>
say, myths accreted to consolidate and preserve a social hierarchy
<br>
might well consider unfalsifiability to be a salient virtue of
<br>
such stories (at least, as far as their social function as tools of
<br>
power is concerned).
<br>
<p>Bertrand Russell, in a discussion of &quot;taboo morality&quot;, comments:
<br>
&quot;Taboo morality is the primitive kind.  It is the only kind, I think,
<br>
in primitive tribes, where, for example, it would be a rule 'You must
<br>
not eat out of one of the chief's dishes.'  If you do you'll probably
<br>
die!... so they say.  And there are all sorts of rules of that sort.
<br>
I remember the king of Dahomey had a rule that he must not look long
<br>
in any one direction, because if he did, there would be tempests
<br>
in that part of his dominions.  And so there was a rule that he
<br>
must always be looking 'round.&quot; (LP &quot;Bertrand Russell Speaking&quot; 1959 52 min.
<br>
Woodrow Wyatt interviews published in _Bertrand Russell Speaks His Mind_).
<br>
<p>And let's not forget the fortune-teller's art as a component of
<br>
religion, which has a long and distinguished history continuing up
<br>
to the present day, and of which unfalsifiability is an essential
<br>
component.  The 1976 BBC television production of Robert Graves' _I Claudius_
<br>
has a great deal of fun with the Roman obsession with fortune
<br>
telling, as for example in the following scene.  Augustus Caesar is
<br>
being poisoned by his wife Livia, and is visited on his sick bed
<br>
by a friend (this is from Episode 5 &quot;Poison Is Queen&quot;, Chapter 4 &quot;False
<br>
Pretenses&quot; on the DVD set):
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  I've had premonitions.  Premonitions of death.
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Well we all have them.
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  No no no no no.  This is serious.  Listen, old friend.
<br>
Let me tell you.  Two weeks after we came back...  from you know
<br>
where, yes...  I was in Mars Field giving a libation -- a little
<br>
ceremony.  Well, you remember!
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Well, I remember, but I wasn't there.
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  No?
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  No.
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Well nearby there's the temple built in the memory of
<br>
Marcus Agrippa.
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Yes, I know it.
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Well, an eagle circled my head five times, then flew off
<br>
and settled on the &quot;A&quot; of Agrippa's name.
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Why, Caesar!
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Oh don't lie to me, don't lie to me, it's clear what it
<br>
means, let's not pretend!  It was telling me that my time had 
<br>
come, and that I must give way to someone by the name of Agrippa.
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Posthumous?
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Who else?
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Did you consult an augur?
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Oh, I don't need an augur, it's plain, plain as the
<br>
nose on your face.
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Well there may be some other explanation -- you're not
<br>
an expert on the interpretation of signs.
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Then listen to this.  The following day, lightning
<br>
melted the &quot;C&quot; on my name on a statue nearby.  It struck the
<br>
&quot;C&quot; of &quot;Caesar&quot;.  Do you follow, &quot;C&quot;!  Now what does &quot;C&quot; mean?
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  A hundred.
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  A hundred.  Exactly!  Livia saw it.  She went to
<br>
an augur to find out what it meant.  She wouldn't tell me,
<br>
but I forced it out of her.  It means that I have only a
<br>
hundred days to live.  I shall die in a hundred days.
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Or weeks!
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Eh?
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Why shouldn't it be weeks?  Or months?  Why shouldn't
<br>
it mean that you live to be a hundred?
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Do you think so?
<br>
<p>QUAESTOR:  Why not?
<br>
<p>AUGUSTUS:  Then perhaps she went to the wrong augur.  Perhaps
<br>
he looked in the wrong book.  (Laughs)
<br>
<p>Further, many of the stories people make up to explain each other's
<br>
behavior are unfalsifiable in principle.  Even present-day psychiatry
<br>
is notorious for making up explanations of this sort.
