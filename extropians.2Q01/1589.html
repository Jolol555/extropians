<p>James raises some very interesting points, which must take us back
<br>
to ground zero with regard to defining our terms.  The discussion
<br>
arose from the distinction between zombies and real 'conscious'
<br>
humans (if I am recalling this thread correctly; its gotten *very*
<br>
long).  Now part of the &quot;value&quot; we seem to place on human
<br>
consciousness seems to be its variability, creativity
<br>
and interactivity.  A lookup-table based instantiation of
<br>
consciousness (some would assume) lacks some of those apsects.
<br>
<p>James takes us further into the &quot;looks, walks, talks&quot; arena
<br>
by proposing that it isn't active &quot;computation&quot; (e.g. requiring
<br>
CPU cycles) that dictates 'consciousness', but the any *equivalent* 
<br>
'expression' of the program.  (We only need to look at the many
<br>
forms in wich the DVD decryption program DeCSS(?) has been
<br>
writtein to be very clear that humans can become *very*
<br>
creative in this regard!)
<br>
<p>So, from this orientation, any &quot;expression&quot; of the *data*
<br>
(lookup tables) is equivalent to an executing ('thinking/conscious')
<br>
program.  (This may have some interesting limits if one considers
<br>
whether or not the lookup tables can generate the range of
<br>
'behaviors' the executing code can generate).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is a &quot;calculation&quot;?  I find the distinction between &quot;calculation&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;lookup&quot; to be meaningless.
</em><br>
<p>This is a primary point.  The space-speed tradeoff in programs
<br>
means that you can produce equivalent expressions with very
<br>
different memory/cpu-cycle requirements.
<br>
<p>However, taken to the limits, this implies that an arbitrary
<br>
collection of atoms, organized in a sufficiently complex
<br>
way that contains all of the lookup 'states' a 'living' being
<br>
will go through in the time they are alive *is* conscious.
<br>
(If you want to sharply constrain this, think of a baby born
<br>
prematurely that only lives a month -- not many 'behaviors'
<br>
are required and the lookup tables would be small. [If you say
<br>
the baby doesn't pass the 'mirror' (self)-consciousness test,
<br>
simply run it forward until they can pass the mirror test
<br>
but die prematurely.])
<br>
<p>The end point of this would seem to be the realization that
<br>
an inanimate collection of atoms *may* posess 'consciousnes'
<br>
(*if* they are properly organized).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Setting a memory word to zero and XOR-ing the same memory word a thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times doesn't produce different results, just different efficiencies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<p>Precisely -- so if this approach is valid, then the &quot;efficiency&quot;
<br>
of the instantiation of the 'consciousness' is irrelevant -- the
<br>
real question is the 'information content' that allows it to
<br>
potentially function as a 'human' consciousness or a 'Drosophila'
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>The consequences of this are interesting -- it means you can never
<br>
*assemble* a collection of atoms in a form that constitutes a
<br>
lookup-table for a consciousness and then disassemble them
<br>
without having committed 'murder'.
<br>

<br>
Are your atoms, morally, not even yours?
