<em>&gt;Joe Dees just said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or a hate crime.  The frothing-at-the-mouth rabid bang-bang afficianadoes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that inflict and infect this list with their enthralled dogmatic memetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;zomboidisms, and try to foist the fear that preventing kids, psychos and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;criminals from getting their hands on guns by passing required background 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;checks at gun shows and flea markets is a sinister plot by the !
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip long email &quot;long story short, guns bad, gun-users crazy&quot;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;um. dude? i really really hate to bring up criticisms of other people, i'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mostly silent on this list, cause i can't write especially well(plus i'm a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;college student in real life, so being a student online seems logical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough) but....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this is nuts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i realize that your position is kind of frustrating, because there are many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people on this list interested in, or involved with guns. but, is language 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like this neccesary? it's kinda demeaning, and frankly, unsupportable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i don't really have an opinion on gun control, but this list is generally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quiet with occasional burst of passion and disagreement. which is fun, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keeps people tuning in. but do you really think the way you talk about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people in this email is justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
These are the same people who call me commie, fascist, liberal, and other things they believe are bad just because I disagree with their attempted methods of rationalizing their obsessions.  I endured a 1200 email flak attack from these freaks once.  They can't pry their cold dead minds away from their compulsions, and treat every disagreement with their propaganda front as an invitation to a cyber  O.K Corral, and they are constitutionally unable to restrain themselves from ad infinitum ad nauseum propagandizing.  I know full well to whom, and to what, I am speaking when I address them.  I own five guns, and realize that the safest world is one where all sane and competent noncriminal adults can easily exercise their constitutional right to keep and bear, while the kids, psychos and criminals have such access blocked as well as we pragmatically can, but they smell a would-be Maoist dictator behind even the most reasonable efforts to effect same, and rail interminably against !
<br>
them.
