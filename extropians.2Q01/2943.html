I knew about the Timeship idea, but what is this about a THEMEPARK???  I was 
<br>
blown out of my chair upon reading this!
<br>
<p>Are we going to have rollercoasters and other rides for people to thrill on? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I suppose I should have said &quot;cryocoaster&quot; or &quot;timecoaster!&quot;  If 
<br>
Saul Kent is smart(and he sure is) there will be a ride where people travel 
<br>
into the future and see just how incredible it will be.  And how surely they 
<br>
need to sign up for cryonics to really make it...
<br>
<p>I can imagine people in costumes going around to play with children.  &quot;Hey, 
<br>
Tommy, isn't that the adorable Nano, the molecular assembler-toon over there 
<br>
by the cotton candy booth?&quot;
<br>
<p>Will the restaurants there have a cryonics theme?  Now, that could really be 
<br>
interesting.  See the chef take your food out of suspension to cook it up 
<br>
just the way you like it!
<br>
<p>And think of all the merchandising!  Snack foods, toys of every sort, lunch 
<br>
boxes and of course in time a Saturday-morning cartoon!  The advertising for 
<br>
this themepark will solidly put cryonics on a subliminal level into the mind 
<br>
of the American public.
<br>
<p>I am not mocking the idea here, simply having a little fun.  I think Saul 
<br>
Kent and Will Faloon are onto something here which worked out pretty damn 
<br>
well for a certain Mr. Walt Disney(sadly not in cryostasis!).
<br>
<p>I read how someone on the list felt the Timeship should be the center of an 
<br>
actual religion!  I would very much disagree with this idea. I do see the 
<br>
news media possibly calling it a temple of fringe science or secular 
<br>
humanism.  But, we should leave the religious connotation at that!  Mixing 
<br>
religion and cryonics in the U.S. could have very ugly and explosive results 
<br>
which really backfire on us.
<br>
<p>The thing which does make me very sad here is to see Alcor so desperate to 
<br>
raise the necessary funds to upgrade their personnel and equipment so 
<br>
whole-body vitrification can become a reality.  I could really feel Fred 
<br>
Chamberlain's sense of need as I read the latest issue of Cryonics magazine. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A few million at the most would utterly turn Alcor around for the better 
<br>
while ironically many million will be spent elsewhere in a way which will 
<br>
take quite a number of years to see fruition.
<br>
<p>I realize Saul Kent and Will Faloon have every right to spend their money 
<br>
how they see fit.  I am DEEPLY GRATEFUL to them for the vast support they 
<br>
have given to cryonics and Alcor in particular.  But, I just hope they will 
<br>
remember Alcor as this interim program moves forward.
<br>
<p>I know not just they but everyone needs to do their part to contribute and 
<br>
they must feel this way to an extent.  It's just that the odds of people put 
<br>
in suspension being fully restored to life would go up astronomically if 
<br>
this program were quickly implemented.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
