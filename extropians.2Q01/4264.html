<p>Volume/surface ratio of a human indicates you can't cool a human body via
<br>
surface transfer without requiring some rather fancy fractal heat exchanger
<br>
inserted into your body (recursive pipes going down all the way to 
<br>
(sub)micrometer scale). Even then, you'll probably need perfusion with 
<br>
iceblockers prior to that and removal of said iceblockers after devitrification
<br>
(could use ohmic heating or chemical enthalpy (catalyzed oxygen/hydrogen
<br>
combustion in situ)). Of course, this is quick, since the fractal plumbing 
<br>
can double as cryoprotectant loading/unloading infrastructure.
<br>
<p>Now this is asking for some fancy (stiff (since high-throughput), intelligent
<br>
(inserting and retracting that heat exchanger is rather nontrivial)) NEMS 
<br>
plumbing, and even then, there will be damage. You'll live, but I very much
<br>
would not like to go through the ordeal unaesthesized. It would hurt like
<br>
the dickens, and the aftermath of the process will weigh upon you heavily
<br>
for days.
<br>
<p>So unless you shut down the higher cortical function for hours to days, 
<br>
to repair the bulk of the damage occured, allowing the patient to recover 
<br>
until enabling brain activity, the procedure will be rather, er, disruptive.
<br>
<p>The organ vitrification thing is rather different.  It's a single organ,
<br>
monotyped tissue allows you to optimize cryoprotectant solutions in a way
<br>
that is impossible a complex system. Volume/surface ratio is way better than
<br>
a human (in absence of fractal heat exchangers). And you're willing to 
<br>
tolerate a lot of tissue damage, because your alternative is 100% tissue 
<br>
damage. A kidney doesn't think, and a brain with 50% of the cells taken
<br>
out of circulations will still produce an EEG.
<br>
<p>So &quot;without any damage at all&quot; boundary conditions is rather harsh. It is 
<br>
not being met by any imaginable technology, i.e. based on known physics.
