<p>While I agree with the basic point you're making, I think it would be more accurate to
<br>
say that both governments and companies do things like that, but that governments do it
<br>
more often. If we're going to be capitalists (and I have no problem with that), then
<br>
why not endeavor to be compassionate capitalists? This may require more work than not
<br>
giving a damn what the consequences of our actions are, but I think we're smart and
<br>
capable enough to do it. And in the long run, working through the free market to both
<br>
make a profit and help improve the lives of everyone (if they want it, of course) will
<br>
produce more customers, thus increasing profits. This just seems like good business to
<br>
me.
