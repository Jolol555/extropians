<p><em>&gt; This is a topic I *almost* stumbled into during my posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on privately funded space exploration, for a private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization may accept higher levels of risk than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NASA.  Remember that *all* astronauts are volunteers.
</em><br>
<p>I have been thinking about this in my roleplaying scenario. In my
<br>
scenario the astronauts are employees, but of course free to turn down
<br>
the mission offer (which is hardly a problem; few people with the
<br>
skills and education necessary for this kind of mission tends to stay
<br>
jobless).
<br>
<p>One thing that might be used in the Orpheus mission is not to load the
<br>
craft with enough fuel to make an emergency return to Earth from the
<br>
asteroid - it has to extract enough water if the crew wants to do
<br>
that. This would save a lot of mass and speed up the expedition, but
<br>
of course introduces a certain risk if all the measurements of the
<br>
asteroid against all expectations are wrong. Then they will have to
<br>
wait for fuel supplies from Earth. 
<br>
<p>Somehow this doesn't sound like anything NASA would ever do.
