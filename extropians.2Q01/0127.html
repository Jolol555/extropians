<p>The problem is that the vast majority of organ donations are done with
<br>
&quot;brain dead&quot; donors...people with massive head and brain injuries who are
<br>
otherwise healthy, with the heart and lungs still functioning.  (Think: 
<br>
motorcycle accident). They are usually kept on respirators for hours or
<br>
even *days* while tests are done for brain function, often with zero blood
<br>
flow in the brain, at normal temperature. 
<br>
<p>Now, there has been some talk and experiment in the medical community of
<br>
expanding the range of donors by rapidly perfusing the whole body with
<br>
cold organ preservation solution to include other cases of rapid death.
<br>
This would be *very* convenient for cryonicists, since this is essentially
<br>
the transport phase of a suspenion, almost impossible to do on little or
<br>
no notice.  If hospitals and doctors all over the country had the
<br>
medications, equipment, and experience to do these for organ transplants,
<br>
they could do them for cryonicists...given enough financial incentive.  It
<br>
is doubtful that this would lead to many organ donations however.
<br>
Cryonicists who are suspended tend to be terminally ill, and few ride
<br>
motorcycles without helmets.  In fact, I'm not aware of *any* suspendees
<br>
who would have been organ donation prospects.  Even &quot;normal&quot; folks with a
<br>
donor card are extremely unlikely to wind up donating.
<br>
<p>Now, *tissue* donations of various sorts *may* be possible...corneas,
<br>
skin, that sort of thing.  I'll have to look into it.
