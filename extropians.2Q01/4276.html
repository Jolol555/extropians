<p><p>This is correct.  I would just like to expand on this a little bit by
<br>
stating that it is possible to compute the maximum possible accuracy of a
<br>
prediction for a given problem.  As you suggest, sufficiently complex
<br>
problems and sufficiently small predictors will produce an intelligent agent
<br>
that is provably unable to give a better prediction than you'd get by
<br>
flipping a coin.  
<br>
<p>Somewhat counter-intuitively, you actually can get *better* results in some
<br>
cases with small predictors by flipping a coin than by using the predictor.
<br>
In these cases, one could easily claim that the predictor was in an
<br>
&quot;irrational&quot; state.  The &quot;irrationality&quot; (which really isn't much more than
<br>
an observer bias in many cases) is usually caused by insufficient
<br>
experiential data and/or insufficient predictor memory.  The &quot;irrationality&quot;
<br>
of the predictor is intimately related to the theoretical accuracy of the
<br>
predictor as mentioned above, and could possibly be quantified as the
<br>
deviation from the maximum for the given configuration.  When the
<br>
irrationality is sufficiently large, the trustworthiness of the predictor
<br>
plummets.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; PS: Solomonoff Induction is well-explained in chapter 5 of Li and Vitányi's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications, 2nd Edition&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is one of the de-facto reference texts on the subject, being heavily
<br>
referenced in papers on the topic.  I would second the recommendation.
