<p>
Curt Adams today offered a derivation purporting to show that if two agents
<br>
start with different priors, and then each update their beliefs on the fact
<br>
that the other one was assigned the prior they got, then the posteriors of
<br>
the two agents will not be the same except under unusual circumstances.  I
<br>
agree that Curt has in fact show this.
<br>
<p>I suspect that Curt thinks that his result contradicts something that I
<br>
have said, but I do not see any contradiction.  The standard agreeing to
<br>
disagree literature starts with agents who have the same priors, and show
<br>
that updating on statements of opinions produces common beliefs.  I also
<br>
have a paper on the causal origins of priors
<br>
(<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/prior.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/prior.pdf</a> or .ps) which shows how updating on the
<br>
fact that you were assigned the prior you got can imply common priors.  But
<br>
neither of these contradict Curt's derivation.
