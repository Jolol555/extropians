<em>&gt;Human Body Recall! Design Problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PERSONAL HEALTH
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By JANE E. BRODY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People who do not meet the current standards of body beautiful — with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;narrow waist, slim hips and trim thighs — might enjoy knowing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this idealized form was not built to last, at least not for three
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or more decades beyond a woman's childbearing years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In fact, if people were manufactured products, one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justifiably accuse their producer of planned obsolescence. Ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;almost anyone over 50 and you are likely to encounter complaints
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about aching backs, sore knees, tired legs, failing vision, fading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hearing, waning strength and/or fragile bones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  These and other commonplace signs of physical deterioration
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prompted three experts on aging to propose a redesign of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;body, inside and out, that could enhance its ability to last to age
</em><br>
<em>&gt;100 without falling apart.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The new design may not win any beauty contests, though the sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drive being what it is, if everyone looked more or less like their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposal, mating opportunities would probably not be affected very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;The living machines we call our bodies deteriorate because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were not designed for extended operation and because we now push
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them to function long past their warranty period,&quot; Dr. Robert N.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Butler, Dr. S. Jay Olshansky and Dr. Bruce A. Carnes write in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current issue of Scientific American.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Dr. Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is now at 74 the president of the International Longevity Center in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;New York. Dr. Olshansky and Dr. Carnes are senior research
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists at the National Opinion Research Center/Center on Aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the University of Chicago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Keeping Up With Life Spans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In an interview, Dr. Butler noted that in the last century alone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life expectancy for Americans increased by about three decades, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;77 from 47.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Researchers in regenerative medicine are already hard at work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to delay the aging process and its associated diseases
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through the use of spare parts derived from stem cells.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But Dr. Butler expressed outrage over the proliferation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-aging products and clinics that hoodwink the gullible into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believing they could counter the aging process through various
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;youth in a bottle&quot; potions, including the administration of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth hormone to the tune of $12,000 to $15,000 a year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;These purveyors fail to understand the role of evolution in how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the body is constructed,&quot; Dr. Butler said. &quot;Evolution's main job is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reproductive success.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Evolution had no effect on preservation of the species beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of childbearing and rearing, so it is not surprising that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;body noticeably deteriorates after about 50.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A New Body Beautiful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In a suggestion that delights yours truly, who is barely 5 feet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tall, Dr. Butler and his collaborators say people should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shorter. This would lower the body's center of gravity and reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the risk of falls that could result in broken bones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In case a person does fall, they offer two further suggestions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anatomical modifications: thicker bones to protect against breakage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and extra padding on the hips and thighs in the form of muscles and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fat that would both help to protect against bone loss and act as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cushioning for bones in the event of a fall or other accident.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Heavier thighs would also help to support the legs and hips.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans now suffer 350,000 hip fractures a year, which cost about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$7 billion and result in the deaths of 20 percent of victims within
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a year of the mishap, Dr. Butler said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So those of you who are already &quot;pear- shaped,&quot; or bottom-heavy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are probably better designed. Your voluptuous hips and thighs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should help you outlast your apple- shaped peers (pear-shaped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people also have a lower risk of heart disease) and be less of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drain on Medicare's budget.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Another area of concern is our ramrod posture, which places
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enormous stress on spinal vertebrae and the cartilaginous disks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In a suggestion likely to distress the military, the three experts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintain that we should be bent forward from the hips to relieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pressure on the vertebrae and to reduce the risk of painful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ruptured or slipped disks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In addition, those disks should be thicker to resist destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pressures, which can ultimately result in bone rubbing on bone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But the forward-bending torso would have us all looking at our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feet or the ground in front of us, like a novice ice skater who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fears the ice won't be there for the next stroke. This prompted the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experts' suggestion that the neck be curved and supported by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;special enlarged vertebrae to keep the head straight and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forward-looking. The resulting form bears a strong resemblance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Neanderthals, who appear to have been more favorably designed, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least with regard to falls.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Perhaps the most bizarre external modification would occur in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knees. As now designed, knees are a notable source of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vulnerability. Witness the proliferation of prescription and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over-the-counter products to counter arthritic knee pain and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast- growing field of knee-replacement surgery. Instead of knees
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that only bend forward, the experts proposed that they should also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be able to bend backward. This, Dr. Butler said, would reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wear and tear on knee bones and cartilage and delay the onset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;painful arthritis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But the reversible knee joint proposal has a downside — knees that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could bend in both directions would no longer lock when the legs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are extended. Thus, standing for long periods might become more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult. Of course, society could accommodate to this new design
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by providing more seating opportunities and by eliminating long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lines (say, at public restrooms), which probably should happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyway to reduce the stress on our aging population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internal Changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To counter the development of varicose veins, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circulatory problem that is especially common in women who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given birth to several children and that can make standing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;walking painful, leg veins would be designed with a continuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;string of valves to help push blood back toward the heart. And to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better protect internal organs (like the spleen, which can rupture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in an accident) and to prevent hernias, we would need additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ribs that extend past the stomach (say goodbye to that fashionably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;slim waist).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  To better protect vision, the optic nerve would be attached, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the front of the retina but to the back to stabilize it against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detachment. And to protect against hearing loss, which can result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from repetitive noise damage, we would need larger ears better able
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to collect sound and more hair cells to record it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  As for our all-too-common plumbing problems, rather than have half
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of older men plagued by the consequences of enlarged prostates, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;urethra would be repositioned outside this gland instead of through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it to keep the urinary channel from being squeezed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  And for women at risk of the socially disabling problem of stress
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incontinence caused by weakened bladder muscles and ligaments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there would be stronger bladder and sphincter muscles and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;durable ligaments to help control the release of urine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But Dr. Butler suggests that no one wait for genetic engineers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;redesign us. By current estimates, he says, &quot;our genes account for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only 30 percent of our health.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;The other 70 percent,&quot; he added, &quot;we can take control of by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improving our diets, exercising and maintaining our cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vitality.&quot;
</em><br>
