</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if I give you this argument of scale, it does not cover all cases. If I

</em><br>
<p>You're quite right.  Fortunately, 2 is not the order of magnitude
<br>
anybody seriously expects on the lifetime of their upload.  I mean,
<br>
granted, who knows, in a hundred years maybe we'll all die, or some
<br>
terrible accident will befall your upload anyway.  But there's no
<br>
reason to think that uploaded copies will live only an extra 100
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>So although, formally speaking, there are some imaginary cases in
<br>
which this philosophical distinction could be teased out, even the
<br>
case of (ordinary) destructive uploading does not do so, leading me to
<br>
think that this really IS one of those angels-on-a-pin question that
<br>
we can debate forever and be none the worse off for not having solved
<br>
them.
