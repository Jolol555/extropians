<p>Oh, ja I did miss that somehow.  I just did a google search
<br>
on spike jones + extropians and got that humor site and a
<br>
bunch of stuff for Damien's The Spike.  Which is fine with me.
<br>
Ja I think there was a Spike Jones that did a comedy-band,
<br>
kinda like a 1950s version of Weird Al Yankovic.  spike
