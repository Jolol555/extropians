<p>I think one has to look at the &quot;generation&quot; of the person who
<br>
started the thread.  Natasha, you probably don't spend as much
<br>
time browsing the Net-personals as I do (unless you and Max
<br>
lead a secret life I'm unaware of... :-)).  I've noticed that
<br>
&quot;hottie&quot; and &quot;chicka&quot; are several terms used by younger generation
<br>
women as self-descriptive self-promotional terms.  I'm not sure
<br>
whether these have crept into the vocabulary as a result of Rap
<br>
music, the increasing ethnicity of the U.S. (particularly the
<br>
southern states and North-east cities) or some other reason.
<br>
I do not know whether &quot;chick&quot; directly equates with &quot;chicka&quot;
<br>
going perhaps from derogatory to affirming.  But I'd take
<br>
the subject line with a big grain of salt and consider that
<br>
perhaps what may be less than polite terms to our generation
<br>
might have morphed into complementary terminology in the
<br>
next-next generation.
<br>
<p>I'm seeing a trend in the media towards very bright, kick-ass
<br>
(as well as attractive) women, e.g. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,
<br>
Dark Angel, Relic Hunter, Xena, Lara Croft, etc.  Some press I've
<br>
seen attributes this to the fact that there are now more female
<br>
executives in positions of responsibility in the media empires.
<br>
So perhaps women are promoting other women in &quot;action&quot; roles
<br>
they would like to imagine themselves in.  Or you could take the
<br>
cynical view and argue that this is where the money is since men
<br>
so easily allow themselves to be lead around by the ring in their
<br>
dipstick.
