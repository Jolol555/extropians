&quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20Common%20Human%20Errors&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104282145.PAA21443@raptor.fc.hp.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt;,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I think we're talking about different things here.
<br>
One thing you seem to be talking about, I would call false
<br>
or unjustifiable hope, as in:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Hope tries to explain to the ignorant the nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowable.&quot; --A.  Bierce
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree that &quot;hope&quot; in some God, for example, is fallacy
<br>
or &quot;common error&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Hope is merely disappointment deferred.&quot; --W. B. Baldry
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assumption here is obviously that the hope is in something
<br>
that is not true.  But if someone invests in the stock market, with
<br>
the hope that it will go higher, this is quite justified and therefore
<br>
something completely different.  On average, people that invest in the
<br>
stock market are not &quot;disappointed&quot;.  Given the last 15 years of my
<br>
investments, I'm certainly not disappointed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another, I'd call passive or inactive hope.  This would be a
<br>
kind of a lazy hope.  For example, hoping that some god will
<br>
eventually come down and give us immortality, rather than doing the
<br>
effort ourselves to try to achieve immortality.  As you said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hope is for children. Determination marks the adult.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child hopes the parent will do it for him.  But the parent
<br>
is determined to do what is required, in hopes that such efforts will
<br>
bring what is hoped for.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree, having those kinds of hopes are a common human error
<br>
which has no redeeming value.  But, when a person makes the effort to
<br>
be crynically preserved, when someone donates money to the American
<br>
Cancer Society, in the hope that it will accomplish some good, that
<br>
kind of hope, even though some of it occasionally doesn't always turn
<br>
out to be what we'd &quot;hoped&quot; for, such is the driving force that has
<br>
given us everything humanity has ever accomplished right?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we in agreement?
<br>
