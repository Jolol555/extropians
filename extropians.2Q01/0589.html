<p>But with the islands case, you have some species adapted to a
<br>
specific niche where there are no competitors and the incoming
<br>
species are those from the larger continents where they have
<br>
had to compete and survive.  They generally come in with
<br>
better &quot;genes&quot; and that is why they win.
<br>
<p>The proper comparison given your example is species coming into
<br>
an island just after it has been formed when there is no established
<br>
ecosystem to take advantage of.  In that situation the &quot;mainlanders&quot;
<br>
don't have an easy time of it.  Only a very limited set of species
<br>
that have evolved to deal with the resource poor conditions manage
<br>
to make a go of it.
<br>
<p>Given the low energy availability you cite on Europa, the species
<br>
from Earth that would manage to compete effectively are probably
<br>
few and far between.  The scientific insights that could
<br>
be derived from any species that were discovered growing in
<br>
such an environment would likely be very great.  Nothing like
<br>
a few billion years of evolution under really poor conditions
<br>
to make you tougher than steel...
