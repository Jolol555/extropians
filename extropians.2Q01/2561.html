<p>There is an interesting paradox in how people react to intrusions into their 
<br>
privacy. On one hand nearly everybody regards it as bad, and we get firm 
<br>
protests against corporate abuse of customer information and how our 
<br>
governments handle sensitive personal information. On the other hand people 
<br>
seem to be almost too ready to allow surveillance and biometrics in order to 
<br>
prevent crime or apprehend criminals. In a situation where real global risks 
<br>
exist, it is all too likely people might embrace broad surveillance and ULE 
<br>
without demanding compensatory accountability. This is where we better debate 
<br>
beforehand. 
<br>
<p>An extropian approach to the problem of destruction (which I consider one of 
<br>
the more significant problems of advanced technology in a free society) would 
<br>
not be based on the assumption of a strong government initiative or even any 
<br>
global change of mind. In order to work in real life and avoid the pitfalls 
<br>
of technocracy a bottom up solution seems more extropian.
<br>
<p>This suggests that we might gain more by looking at private systems of 
<br>
monitoring of dangerous technology and in promoting an open/transparent 
<br>
society with sane policies. A good example of private monitoring is antivirus 
<br>
software, where we currently have a fairly fast and efficient network of 
<br>
updates. This could presumably be extended to nanoimmune systems and perhaps 
<br>
biotechnology. It might also be worth examining whether insurance companies 
<br>
would be interested in participating in these networks, as mediators, 
<br>
investors or promotors.
