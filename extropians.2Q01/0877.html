<p><em>&gt;Me too, the question is does magic exist? In a chapter in his book
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The Physics of Immortality&quot; Frank Tipler gave a fairly plausible rough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outline of how the universe might be able to perform an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(not just very large) number of calculations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's true that since the book was written evidence has suggested that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we don't live in the sort of universe that Tipler thought we did,
</em><br>
<p>I have some other concerns about Tipler's model, but what you mention
<br>
was my primary concern.  We face a Dysonian end-game, not a Tiplerian
<br>
one, and our successors will face distinctly limited resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;some people on this thread were proposing future SI's would sim us.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What's wrong with that?
</em><br>
<p>First, they aren't going to have resources to do what we're in.  Second,
<br>
they'll never really know what we were due to complexity, uncertainty,
<br>
and the veil of relativity (they can never see any photon we emit and
<br>
so can't back-calculate its consequences)
