<p>
A few folks here and elsewhere told me they noticed a
<br>
change in my online persona (didn't knew it was thus obvious)
<br>
since a few months.
<br>
<p>I'm perfectly allright, in fact rarely been better. It's just
<br>
I've been assessing where I am, and where I should be, and 
<br>
realized I've been somewhat personally stagnating for a while. 
<br>
Especially because I'm a borderline flake, I decided lunatic 
<br>
fringe is perhaps not an entirely appropriate place for me 
<br>
to dwell too long. It sure is fun, but it doesn't get much 
<br>
done. Because of this I have decided to reshift priorities, 
<br>
and to see whether this will make me more productive in 
<br>
what I would like to do. It's going to hurt, but I will cut 
<br>
down my online feed to a minimum, to the technical bits 
<br>
I really need for my dayjob and the private projects (the 
<br>
biggest of them the nematode thingy -- hey, if there are 
<br>
Ph.D. position offerings for worm uploads (though not by 
<br>
such label) you know things are going to become interesting).
<br>
<p>So I'm going to temporally drop a few lists, and switch from
<br>
pure push to pull on some high-volume ones. So I gotta run, be
<br>
back later. Have fun!
