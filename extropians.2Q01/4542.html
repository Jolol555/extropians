<p>Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>I was not sure if this had already been posted by Paul Wakfer so I am doing 
<br>
so.  A person sympathetic to extropian views is a candidate for FDA top 
<br>
leadership.  Please, do your part by using this post as a template to write 
<br>
and/or fax the president.  I have already done this but we all need to do 
<br>
our part on such a crucial matter.
<br>
<p>sincerely,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>The Next FDA Commissioner
<br>
<em> &gt;                 Could Determine How Long You Live!
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; May 17, 2001
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Dear Fellow Life Extensionist:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The greatest obstacle to your health and longevity is the FDA.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Bureaucratic barriers at the FDA stifle the development of novel
</em><br>
<em> &gt; medicines, causing the suffering and death of Americans who desperately
</em><br>
<em> &gt; need these therapies to stay alive.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; While Congress and the Federal Courts have helped curtail FDA
</em><br>
<em> &gt; over-regulation, today's flawed system continues to deny Americans access
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to the best that science has to offer.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; We now have a unique opportunity to change the course of medical history.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; President Bush is considering whom to nominate as the next FDA
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Commissioner.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; There is one candidate for the Commissioner’s job who has a plan to reform
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the FDA in order to speed the delivery of the fruits of medical research
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to every one of us.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The name of this candidate is Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D. The information that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; follows shows that Dr. Ruwart is uniquely qualified to reform an agency
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that has lost touch with scientific objectivity.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It is imperative that you notify President Bush that Dr. Ruwart is the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; best person to remedy the severe problems that exist at the FDA. Please
</em><br>
<em> &gt; copy and mail the letter that follows to the President at the address we
</em><br>
<em> &gt; have provided.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; If you want to do more, and we hope that you will, we encourage you to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; write a personalized letter to mail or fax to The White House.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; We have also provided a phone number for those who want to call The White
</em><br>
<em> &gt; House to emphasize the importance of appointing Dr. Ruwart as the next FDA
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Commissioner.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Even if you have not participated in these types of FDA-reform campaigns
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in the past, we urge you to do so on this critical issue.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Our fear is that lifesaving therapies will continue to remain bogged down
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in FDA red tape if a change within the agency is not made. It has become
</em><br>
<em> &gt; so burdensome to gain FDA approval that innovative therapies in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; are being abandoned because of extraordinarily high costs and uncertain
</em><br>
<em> &gt; bureaucratic delays.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; If Dr. Ruwart were to become the new Commissioner, this barrier against
</em><br>
<em> &gt; medical innovation would be diminished.  More Americans would gain rapid
</em><br>
<em> &gt; access to novel medical treatments that could significantly extend the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; healthy human life span.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; What makes the FDA problem unique is the possibility that each of us will
</em><br>
<em> &gt; die from a disease that could have been effectively treated if the FDA
</em><br>
<em> &gt; didn’t stand in the way.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Inefficient government thrives on citizen apathy, so please take the time
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to mail the enclosed letter to President Bush.  The life you save may be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; your own!
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; For longer life,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; William Faloon
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; P.S. Those who understand the urgent need for FDA reform and want to do
</em><br>
<em> &gt; more should send The White House a personalized letter and/or make a phone
</em><br>
<em> &gt; call. The information that follows reveals how you can get your message
</em><br>
<em> &gt; through to The White House.

<em> &gt; Dr. Mary J. Ruwart’s Letter to President Bush:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; May 8, 2001
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; President G.W. Bush
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Presidential Personnel Office
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The White House
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Washington, DC 20500
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Dear President Bush,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I am enclosing my Presidential Personnel Application Form and resume in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; order that you might consider my appointment as FDA Commissioner.  Because
</em><br>
<em> &gt; you have already invited a number of market-minded individuals to your
</em><br>
<em> &gt; team, I hope that you will look favorably on my pro-market orientation.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; My nomination for FDA Commissioner is likely to enjoy widespread support,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; especially from the groups listed below.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 1.  Pharmaceutical industry.   For almost twenty years, I was a research
</em><br>
<em> &gt; scientist at a major pharmaceutical company and understand the impact of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; regulatory delays. Former FDA Commissioner, Alexander Schmidt, once
</em><br>
<em> &gt; remarked, “The failure to approve an important new drug can be as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; detrimental to the public health as the approval of a potentially bad
</em><br>
<em> &gt; drug.” As your appointee, I would pursue a more cooperative approach with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; pharmaceutical firms in order to speed the delivery of new, life-saving
</em><br>
<em> &gt; medications to the American public.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 2.  Physicians.  Doctors often prescribe approved medications for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; off-label uses in order to give their patients the best health care
</em><br>
<em> &gt; options.  However, the FDA discourages drug companies from sharing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; information that would educate physicians about these choices for their
</em><br>
<em> &gt; patients.  As your appointee, I would make this valuable knowledge on
</em><br>
<em> &gt; off-label use available to our dedicated health care practitioners.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 3.  Alternative practitioners. Health care professionals who utilize
</em><br>
<em> &gt; non-traditional methods of treatment are often subjected to prejudicial
</em><br>
<em> &gt; treatment by the FDA, even in the absence of patient complaints.  As your
</em><br>
<em> &gt; appointee, I would intervene only when patients were at risk, thereby
</em><br>
<em> &gt; broadening our health care choices.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 4.  American public.  Whenever Congress considered giving the FDA more
</em><br>
<em> &gt; control over nutritional supplements, voters inundated their
</em><br>
<em> &gt; representatives with protests.  The American public clearly wants the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; freedom to choose what vitamins and minerals to take.  As your appointee,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I would honor the choice of my fellow Americans.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; 5.  Dedicated FDA employees.  FDA examiners are in a no-win situation.  If
</em><br>
<em> &gt; they delay approving a drug with life-saving potential, many Americans,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; especially those with terminal diseases, die needlessly.  If the FDA
</em><br>
<em> &gt; approves a drug and unpredictable side effects occur, the FDA is blamed.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; As your appointee, I will alleviate this situation, by allowing terminally
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ill patients to “opt-out” of the approval process.  They will then have
</em><br>
<em> &gt; access to potentially life-saving medications which are not yet through
</em><br>
<em> &gt; FDA review.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In 1999, a Federal Appellate Court ruled 11-0 that the FDA must abide by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and permit truthful health
</em><br>
<em> &gt; claims for antioxidants, fiber, folic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (Pearson vs. Shalala). The FDA ignored this decision and in February of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this year was censured by the court for its failure to comply.  As your
</em><br>
<em> &gt; appointee, I would make sure that the FDA abides by our Constitution, the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; law of the land.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; As your appointee, my goal will be to facilitate the conversion of the FDA
</em><br>
<em> &gt; from a bureaucratic regulatory regime into a market-oriented support
</em><br>
<em> &gt; system that maximizes our access to life-savings medications.  Of course,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; only a team effort will achieve this dramatic shift.  Win-win strategies,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; such as the ones described above, can help create alignment among groups
</em><br>
<em> &gt; who may sometimes be at odds with each other.  I believe that I have the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; experience and the skills to create such an environment.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I hope that you will seriously consider moving the FDA in a direction that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; will stimulate innovative drug development.  After all, before we are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; politicians or special interest groups, we are human beings.  Whether we
</em><br>
<em> &gt; enjoy a long life or a short one will largely depend on the availability
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of  life-saving medications.  I would be honored, as your appointee, to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; help the American people­and yourself­achieve the longest, most productive
</em><br>
<em> &gt; life possible.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Sincerely,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D.

<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;

<em> &gt; --------------------------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Date:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; President George W. Bush
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The White House
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Washington DC 20500
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Dear President Bush:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I request that you appoint Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D., as the next Commissioner
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The reason for the urgency of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this appointment is that serious institutional problems exist within the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; FDA that cause Americans to suffer and die needlessly. Dr. Ruwart has
</em><br>
<em> &gt; identified what's wrong with the FDA and has proposed practical solutions.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I am concerned that anyone else you appoint will continue a &quot;business as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; usual&quot; approach that will not result in the kind of reform that is needed
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to prevent disease, injury and death by over-regulation.  In her
</em><br>
<em> &gt; application to you, Dr. Ruwart stated, &quot;My goal will be to facilitate the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; conversion of the FDA from a bureaucratic regulatory regime into a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; market-oriented support system that maximizes our access to life-saving
</em><br>
<em> &gt; medications.&quot; The public is becoming increasingly aware that the FDA is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; largely responsible for the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; When Americans are diagnosed with serious diseases, many are now seeking
</em><br>
<em> &gt; therapies that have not yet been approved by the FDA.  I find it
</em><br>
<em> &gt; deplorable that the agency that is supposed to &quot;protect the health of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; American public&quot; has become a major impediment to their access of new
</em><br>
<em> &gt; life-saving therapies.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The most important issue to me is my health and the cost of prescription
</em><br>
<em> &gt; drugs.  I therefore urge you to make a historic and humane decision by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; appointing Dr. Ruwart as the next Commissioner of the Food and Drug
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Administration.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Please let me know your position on this issue.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Sincerely,

</em><br>
<em> &gt;                                      LET YOUR VOICE  BE HEARD AT THE WHITE
</em><br>
<em> &gt; HOUSE
</em><br>
<em> &gt;                                                          It’s Easier Than
</em><br>
<em> &gt; You Think!
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; We live in a democratic society, yet few Americans take the time to let
</em><br>
<em> &gt; their elected officials know what is really important.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In the case of the FDA, severe problems have been repeatedly identified,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; but a politically palatable solution has never been conveyed to the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; President of the United States. Since the President will be appointing a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; new FDA commissioner soon, it’s time to speak out.  If we fail to point
</em><br>
<em> &gt; out an obvious way of reforming the FDA, it’s hard to complain later about
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the agency’s continuing inadequacies.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; For the first time in history, a qualified individual has emerged with a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; specific plan to turn the FDA into an organization that will facilitate,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rather than impede, the development of new therapies to eradicate disease.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It is now up to those of us who understand the FDA problem to convey the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; solution to the President. Our message to President Bush is simple. Dr.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Mary J. Ruwart is the best qualified individual to lead the FDA out of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; medical dark ages.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; History has shown us that FDA Commissioners are primarily concerned with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; maintaining the status quo, rather than resolving serious problems within
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the agency. This lack of vision is why Americans continue to suffer and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; die in the FDA’s “waiting room”.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Dr. Ruwart has proposed meaningful reforms within the FDA.  For those
</em><br>
<em> &gt; depending on scientific breakthroughs to stay alive, it is critical for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the next Commissioner to have the vision to tear down the FDA’s barriers
</em><br>
<em> &gt; against medical innovation. Dr. Ruwart has emerged as the most viable
</em><br>
<em> &gt; candidate to implement these life-saving changes.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The White House is set up to receive suggestions and comments from the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; public. The following are several ways to let your voice be heard:
