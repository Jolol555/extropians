</em><br>
<em>&gt;A sunny Saturday morning in May, ten past seven, shuffle out of bed, log
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in to e-mail as usual. The usual blue bold headings drop into place,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mostly junk, some expected, and my gaze absently follows them down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;page. The name Douglas Adams catches my eye and I smile. That one, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least, will be good for a laugh. Then I do the classic double-take, back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up the screen. WHAT did that heading actually say? DOUGLAS ADAMS DIED OF A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;HEART ATTACK A FEW HOURS AGO. Then that other cliché, the words swelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before my eyes. It must be part of the joke. It must be some other Douglas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Adams. This is too ridiculous to be true. I must still be asleep. I open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the message, from a well-known German software designer. It is no joke, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;am fully awake. And it is the right - or rather the wrong - Douglas Adams.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A sudden heart attack, in the gym in Santa Barbara. &quot;Man, man, man, man oh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;man,&quot; the message concludes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Man indeed, what a man. A giant of a man, surely nearer seven foot than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;six, broad-shouldered, and he did not stoop like some very tall men who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feel uncomfortable with their height. But nor did he swagger with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;macho assertiveness that can be intimidating in a big man. He neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apologised for his height, nor flaunted it. It was part of the joke
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against himself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One of the great wits of our age, his sophisticated humour was founded in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a deep, amalgamated knowledge of literature and science, two of my great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;loves. And he introduced me to my wife - at his fortieth birthday party.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He was exactly her age, they had worked together on Dr Who. Should I tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;her now, or let her sleep a bit longer before shattering her day? He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;initiated our togetherness and was a recurrently important part of it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must tell her now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Douglas and I met because I sent him an unsolicited fan letter - I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is the only time I have ever written one. I had adored THE HITCHHIKER'S
</em><br>
<em>&gt;GUIDE TO THE GALAXY. Then I read DIRK GENTLY'S HOLISTIC DETECTIVE AGENCY.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As soon as I finished it I turned back to page one and read it straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through again - the only I time I have ever done that, and I wrote to tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him so. He replied that he was a fan of my books, and he invited me to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;house in London. I have seldom met a more congenial spirit. Obviously I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knew he would be funny. What I didn't know was how deeply read he was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science. I should have guessed, for you can't understand many of the jokes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in HITCHHIKER if you don't know a lot of advanced science. And in modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electronic technology he was a real expert. We talked science a lot, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;private, and even in public at literary festivals and on the wireless or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;television. And he became my guru on all technical problems. Rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;struggle with some ill-written and incomprehensible manual in Pacific Rim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;English, I would fire off an e-mail to Douglas. He would reply, often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within minutes, whether in London or Santa Barbara, or some hotel room
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anywhere in the world. Unlike most staffers of professional help lines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Douglas understood EXACTLY my problem, knew EXACTLY why it was troubling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me, and always had the solution ready, lucidly and amusingly explained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Our frequent e-mail exchanges brimmed with literary and scientific jokes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and affectionately sardonic little asides. His technophilia shone through,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but so did his rich sense of the absurd. The whole world was one big Monty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Python sketch, and the follies of humanity are as comic in the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;silicon valleys as anywhere else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He laughed at himself with equal good humour. At, for example, his epic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bouts of writer's block (&quot;I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they make as they go by&quot;) when, according to legend, his publisher and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;book agent would literally lock him in a hotel room, with no telephone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and nothing to do but write, releasing him only for supervised walks. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his enthusiasm ran away with him and he advanced a biological theory too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eccentric for my professional scepticism to let pass, his mien at my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dismissal of it would always be more humorously self-mocking than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genuinely crestfallen. And he would have another go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He laughed at his own jokes, which good comedians are supposed not to, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he did it with such charm that the jokes became even funnier. He was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gently able to poke fun without wounding, and it would be aimed not at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals but at their absurd ideas. To illustrate the vain conceit that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the universe must be somehow pre-ordained for us, because we are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well-suited to live in it, he mimed a wonderfully funny imitation of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;puddle of water, fitting itself snugly into a depression in the ground,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;THE DEPRESSION UNCANNILY BEING EXACTLY THE SAME SHAPE AS THE PUDDLE. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there's this parable, which he told with huge enjoyment, whose moral leaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out with no further explanation. A man didn't understand how televisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work, and was convinced that there must be lots of little men inside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;box. manipulating images at high speed. An engineer explained to him about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high frequency modulations of the electromagnetic spectrum, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transmitters and receivers, about amplifiers and cathode ray tubes, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scan lines moving across and down a phosphorescent screen. The man
</em><br>
<em>&gt;listened to the engineer with careful attention, nodding his head at every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;step of the argument. At the end he pronounced himself satisfied. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really did now understand how televisions work. &quot;But I expect there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just a few little men in there, aren't there?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the mountain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender (he once climbed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit to raise money to fight the cretinous trade in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rhino horn), Apple Computer has lost its most eloquent apologist. And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have lost an irreplaceable intellectual companion and one of the kindest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and funniest men I ever met. I officially received a happy piece of news
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yesterday, which would have delighted him. I wasn't allowed to tell anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during the weeks I have secretly known about it, and now that I am allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to it is too late.

<em>&gt;The sun is shining, life must go on, seize the day and all those clichés.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We shall plant a tree this very day: a Douglas Fir, tall, upright,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evergreen. It is the wrong time of year, but we'll give it our best shot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Off to the arboretum.
