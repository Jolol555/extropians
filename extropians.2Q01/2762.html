Eliezer's probably not going to be available over the next 4 days due to
<br>
the Foresight Gathering, so I'll take a shot at this. Flare actually is
<br>
on our list of things to do right after finishing Friendly AI. So we hope
<br>
to get some work done on that this summer. However, it will only be the
<br>
preliminary work- making the spec, etc. etc. The idea after that is to
<br>
hand it off to a full time person to manage, and that person can bring in
<br>
other people to work part time on it if they want. If we found a full time
<br>
volunteer we definitely would consider that.
<br>
<p>More importantly, we do not have any plans to rely on Flare... at this
<br>
point it's more of a &quot;nice if you got it, but not absolutely necessary&quot;.
<br>
Late this year we plan to begin coding work on our AI, and at the current
<br>
time it is looking like we will do the initial work in Python. If at some
<br>
time later Flare becomes usable we would switch over. Or if Flare never
<br>
gets built we can probably struggle along with just using Python and other
<br>
existing languages.
<br>
<p>Many of the documents at sysopmind are out of date in parts, so beware.
<br>
Anything not updated since last fall is most definitely out of date. The
<br>
only stuff you can definitely count on being up to date are documents hosted
<br>
directly at SingInst.org.

<em>&gt; Without the specs for Flare, it is difficult to see how Flare solves
</em><br>
