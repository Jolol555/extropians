<p>Greg you hit upon a sore spot for aerospace engineers.  Back in
<br>
1991-92, the space station was getting some enormous budget
<br>
hits.  The Fischer-Price configuration was introduced, greatly
<br>
downsizing the station.  Around that time frame, any
<br>
cool new tech was deep 6ed, and there were maaaany frustrated
<br>
engineers.  Fischer and Price were two actual persons; the
<br>
fact that Fischer-Price is also a toy company didnt help matters.
<br>
<p>The new station configuration was so dinky, no one wanted to
<br>
work the project, so they got a lotta guys who either had low
<br>
seniority or couldnt get clearances, etc.  Then they got dissed
<br>
by their coworkers, just to add insult to injury.  They werent
<br>
allowed to innovate, just put the thing up there, faster better
<br>
cheaper.
<br>
<p>Heres one for ya: look for posters showing artists concepts
<br>
of the space station, especially those that were drawn in about
<br>
the 1991-93 time frame.  A lot of them show the space shuttle
<br>
in the drawing, but it is in the background, not shown docking
<br>
with the station, so size comparisons could not be made.  But
<br>
they always tried to exaggerate the size of the station.  Models
<br>
never showed the station docked with the shuttle.  So, I took
<br>
their dimensions and drew a space station next to a shuttle and
<br>
showed it to some people, who were surprised at how small
<br>
the thing was.  Needless to say, morale was low over in the
<br>
space station building.
<br>
<p>Then the centrifuge and pretty much all the other cool stuff
<br>
that was originally planned was axed.  {8-[  The science content
<br>
of that project is quite low, I fear.  spike
