It was a very interesting show.
<br>
<p>One point that I had not realized is that the patent lawyers have possibly
<br>
conflicting claims in respect to their products.  For environmental and FDA
<br>
purposes, they stress that the product is 99.999% the same as other foods so
<br>
that no special rules are necessary.  However, for intellectual patent
<br>
claims, they assert that these foods are radically different form
<br>
unpatentable food and share little commonality with regular foods.
<br>
<p>The other surprise to me was the obvious statement that genetically modified
<br>
foods that produce their own resistance to bugs have the same problem as
<br>
pesticides.  They will wipe out all the susceptible bugs and leave only the
<br>
resistant ones for the next generation.  Thus, most of these types of
<br>
products are only expected to be useful for a few years before they no
<br>
longer work.  The companies hope to provide a string of different crop
<br>
strains faster than they become obsolete.
<br>
<p>What was not surprising to me was the explanation that these crops produce
<br>
the same poisons that are known to kill bugs, at low enough levels that it
<br>
hopefully affect humans.  The technique of low-level poison is the same as
<br>
used by pesticide use.  One possible difference is that this pesticide can't
<br>
be washed off.
<br>
<p>All in all, the program was very positive toward the technology, and
<br>
generally portrayed the nay Sayers as kooks with no scientific evidence.
<br>
The key to the title was that people fear this technology (not that it is
<br>
horrible).
