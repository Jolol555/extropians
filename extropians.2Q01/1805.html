In an earlier post in this thread, I wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I poked my nose a while back into an exchange between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien and Eliezer in which Eliezer had displayed some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rhetorical legerdemain by standing on its head the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usual claim that science deals in falsifiable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions and hypotheses, while relgion deals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with inherently non-falsifiable concepts.  E. made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the statement that prior to the modern era,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious texts relied for their authority on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descriptions of events (such as Moses parting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Red Sea) that are very concrete indeed, and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsifiable in principle, whereas it was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symptom of the demoralization of modern theologians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they shied away from such concrete statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It occurs to me now that this is all really beside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the most important element of belief, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists and priests and laymen alike, for butchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and bakers and computer programmers, is the culturally-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derived semantic web that people carry around in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads, what W. V. O. Quine called, in a book by that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; title, &quot;The Web of Belief&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It fits in with [E. O. Wilson's] notion of consilience that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educated modern people, more than people of past times, insist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that any fact or principle in which they are expected to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe must be able to be integrated into a consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nexus of similar facts and principles without collapsing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or radically distorting the entire web.
</em><br>
<p>I rediscovered a passage in a book today which I must
<br>
have first browsed in 25 years ago, and which first started
<br>
me thinking in these holistic terms about the notion of
<br>
&quot;truth&quot;.
<br>
<p>In _From a Logical Point of View_ (Willard Van Orman Quine,
<br>
1951), Chapter II &quot;Two Dogmas of Empricism&quot;, section 5
<br>
&quot;The Verification Theory and Reductionism&quot;, Quine writes
<br>
(but the italics, **...**, are all mine):
<br>
<p>&quot;[T]he dogma of reductionism has... continued to influence
<br>
the thought of empiricists.  The notion lingers that to each
<br>
statement, or each synthetic statement, there is associated
<br>
a unique range of possible sensory events such that the
<br>
occurrence of any of them would add to the likelihood of
<br>
truth of the statement, and that there is associated also
<br>
another unique range of possible sensory events whose
<br>
occurrence would detract from that likelihood.  This notion
<br>
is of course implicit in the verification theory of
<br>
meaning...
<br>
<p>We lately reflected that in general the truth of statements
<br>
does obviously depend both upon language and upon
<br>
extralinguistic fact; and we noted that this obvious
<br>
circumstance carries in its train...  the feeling that
<br>
the truth of a statement is somehow analyzable into a
<br>
linguistic component and a factual component.  The
<br>
factual component must, if we are empiricists, boil down
<br>
to a range of confirmatory experiences.  In the extreme
<br>
case where the linguistic component is all that matters,
<br>
a true statement is analytic.  But I hope we are now
<br>
impressed with how stubbornly the distinction between
<br>
analytic and synthetic has resisted any straightforward
<br>
drawing.  I am impressed also... with how baffling the
<br>
problem has always been of arriving at any explicit theory
<br>
of the empirical confirmation of a synthetic statement.
<br>
My present suggestion is that it is nonsense, and the root
<br>
of much nonsense, to speak of a linguistic component and
<br>
a factual component in the truth of any **individual** statement.
<br>
Taken collectively, science has its double dependence upon
<br>
language and experience; but this duality is not significantly
<br>
traceable into the statement of science **taken one by one**..
<br>
<p>The unit of empirical significance is the **whole of science**.&quot;
<br>
<p>And from Section 6, &quot;Empiricism without the Dogmas&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;The totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from
<br>
the most casual matters of geography and history to its
<br>
profoundest laws of atomic physics or even of pure
<br>
mathematics and logic, is a man-made fabric which impinges
<br>
on experience only along the edges.  Or, to change the
<br>
figure, total science is like a field of force whose boundary
<br>
conditions are experience.  A conflict with experience at
<br>
the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the
<br>
field.  Truth values have to be redistributed over some of
<br>
our statements.  Reevaluation of some statements entails
<br>
reevaluation of others, because of their logical
<br>
interconnections -- the logical laws being in turn simply
<br>
certain further statements of the system, certain further
<br>
elements of the field.  Having reevaluated one statement
<br>
we must reevaluate some others, which may be statements
<br>
logically connected with the first or may be the statements
<br>
of logical connections themselves.  But the total field
<br>
is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions, experience,
<br>
that there is much latitute of choice as to what statements
<br>
to reevaluate in the light of any single contrary
<br>
experience.  No particular experiences are linked with any
<br>
particular statements in the interior of the field, except
<br>
indirectly through considerations of equilibrium affecting
<br>
the field as a whole.
<br>
<p>If this view is right, it is misleading to speak of the
<br>
empricial content of an individual statement -- especially
<br>
if it is a statement at all remote from the experiential
<br>
periphery of the field.  Furthermore it becomes folly to
<br>
seek a boundary between synthetic statements, which hold
<br>
contingently on experience, and analytic statements, which
<br>
hold come what may.  **Any** statement can be held true come
<br>
what may, **if** we make drastic enough adjustments
<br>
elsewhere in the system.  Even a statement very close to
<br>
the periphery can be held true in the face of recalcitrant
<br>
experience by pleading hallucination or by amending certain
<br>
statements of the kind called logical laws.  Conversely,
<br>
by the same token, no statement is immune to revision.
<br>
Revision even of the logical law of the excluded middle
<br>
has been proposed as a means of simplifying quantum
<br>
mechanics; and what difference is there in principle
<br>
between such a shift and the shift whereby Kepler
<br>
superseded Ptolemy, or Einstein Newton, or Darwin
<br>
Aristotle?&quot;
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>Not to give anybody the wrong impression,
<br>
W. V. O. Quine is almost out of reach of my intellect,
<br>
and is completely out of my reach in his technical
<br>
writing.  However, I am sort of capable of following his
<br>
more narrative passages, in a more-or-less impressionistic
<br>
way!  I was introduced to Quine by my friend F, who is
<br>
himself the smartest person I have ever known personally,
<br>
and who has been an admirer of Quine for 40 years. 
<br>
F has told me that he finds no other author so
<br>
soothing in the clarity of his thought, and that he
<br>
**bathes** in Quine, as you might take a hot bath to
<br>
relax away the stress of the daily grind (this reminds
<br>
me of the Talsit treatments used by the inhabitants of
<br>
the Hexamon Nexus in Greg Bear's _Eon_ books ;-&gt;).
<br>
<p>When Quine passed away at the end of last year, F
<br>
added an appreciation to the Web page established for
<br>
that purpose, and as a result was invited by Quine's
<br>
son to a memorial service at Harvard earlier this month.
<br>
He described the event to me thus:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Computers do slow things down, but one thing can be said for them:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   they provide work for people who would otherwise be unemployable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     -- W. V. O. Quine, quoted by his son...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had sort of expected a bunch of people standing around drinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sherry &amp; trading reminiscences, but it turned out to be a program (in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lecture hall in which Quine himself had taught many of his courses) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which family &amp; colleagues gave talks, most of them moving in spots,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interspersed with recorded music Quine had liked, mostly Gilbert &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sullivan.  I got to see the famous typewriter on which he had replaced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dispensable characters, such as the question mark, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indispensible ones, such as the &quot;implies&quot; sign.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't see anyone I knew, but when I signed the guest book, I saw, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of lines up, the name of Julie (Skinner) Vargas, BFS's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; daughter, who had been at Putney in my time.  She was the only girl in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ham radio club.
