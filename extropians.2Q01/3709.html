<p>Yes, sorry about that. Thanks for pointing it out; I

was being sloppy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I doubt if even E. O. Wilson would claim that every

</em><br>
<p>I'm hardly asking that merely the patterns of extant people 
<br>
be preserved, but that they be able to get runtime as well. 
<br>
That's the whole issue.  As Larry Ellison apparently likes 
<br>
to remark, &quot;Death has never made any sense to me.  How can 
<br>
a person be there and then just vanish, just not be there?&quot;
<br>
<p>The more that you think about it, the more senseless
<br>
death becomes, especially in light of the ridiculously
<br>
modest resources that it would require to keep someone
<br>
alive forever.  A cubic millimeter would easily suffice
<br>
for the complete emulation of quite a few people, even
<br>
at the rate of 1 second per second.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I imagine it wouldn't take a lot of data to blend up somebody 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot like Jim F. at the personality paint store...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which of these differences [that make Jim F. who he is, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not someone of a similar background] makes a difference worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving, in how much detail?
</em><br>
<p>Worth preserving???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But how many of us can really objectively believe that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embody a pattern so unique and valuable that we couldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be replaced by one of the other six billion humans on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planet (or some pattern synthesized from the &quot;types&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they represent) without making a dent in the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Cosmos?
</em><br>
<p>We are going around and around on this.  &quot;VALUABLE TO 
<br>
WHOM?&quot;, I fairly want to scream.  As with some of
<br>
Samantha's earlier sentences, you seem to be looking
<br>
for a Cosmic Significance that seems to be the
<br>
Almighty under some other name.
<br>
<p>Why should your life have to make a dent in the history of 
<br>
the universe to be valuable to you?  Or to me, or to anyone? 
<br>
<p>For every human being who has ever lived, his or her life has
<br>
been for at least some of that time of crucial importance
<br>
to him or her.  Is there any reason that we should cavalierly
<br>
conclude that their lives aren't worth saving if we end up
<br>
with the means to do so?
<br>
<p>Can you see what a transformation of values that cryonics 
<br>
stands for?  Nothing less than the repudiation of death for 
<br>
all sentient beings.  While many have every right to object on 
<br>
ground of (current) practicality, I can no longer understand 
<br>
why this, in principle, is objectionable to anyone.
<br>
<p>The heart leads the mind, and if your heart were to whisper 
<br>
to you, &quot;It's all right to live forever, and it's all right 
<br>
for everyone to live forever&quot;, can your mind really object?
<br>
<p>Lee
