<p>Rocket, Please &quot;Phone Home&quot; 
<br>
<p>Imagine a day when self-diagnostic tools allow future rockets to phone
<br>
home with vital information about their condition, location and
<br>
performance. NASA engineers hope that day comes sooner than later and
<br>
believe the technology could replace expensive ground systems,
<br>
reducing the cost of space flight.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Flight Modem,&quot; being developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight
<br>
Center's Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, VA, allows a rocket
<br>
or any other flight vehicle to communicate with ground controllers
<br>
without the traditional and costly equipment typically associated with
<br>
flight missions.
<br>
<p>&quot;Accessing space is costly, and it represents a major impediment for
<br>
both government and industry exploration and research,&quot; said Jay
<br>
Pittman, Advanced Range Technology Initiative (ARTI) engineer at
<br>
Wallops. &quot;The flight modem and innovations like it could reduce or
<br>
even eliminate some of the costs associated with ground-based
<br>
tracking-systems operations and maintenance.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Flight Modem, located aboard the rocket, basically acts like a
<br>
cell phone and places a call, through orbiting satellites, to ground
<br>
controllers. The modem can relay the position of the rocket and may
<br>
one day also provide information on the performance and health of the
<br>
vehicle and its payload.
<br>
<p>A prototype system, costing less than $2,500 and based on off-the-
<br>
shelf components, was flown in early February aboard a Nike-Orion
<br>
suborbital rocket from Kiruna, Sweden. At launch, the modem, which
<br>
weighed less than three pounds, phoned home via the Globalstar
<br>
Communications satellite constellation. Engineers are now analyzing
<br>
the system's performance.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is really a breakthrough for us,&quot; said Dwayne Morgan, lead
<br>
engineer on the Flight Modem. &quot;The data looked even better than we
<br>
hoped. What this means is that it may be possible to track and
<br>
communicate with our launch vehicles on demand, at very low systems
<br>
and mission operations costs.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Our goal in ARTI is to revolutionize the way we support tracking and
<br>
commanding an in-flight expendable launch vehicle. The performance of
<br>
the Flight Modem prototype system during the first flight test showed
<br>
we are on the right track,&quot; Morgan said.
<br>
<p>Pittman said, &quot;When perfected, the Flight Modem could become a
<br>
pervasive presence in aircraft and launch vehicle activities and the
<br>
basis for development of applications that haven't even been thought
<br>
of yet. We could imagine science or even commercial aircraft 'phoning
<br>
in' data for analysis from anywhere in the world and from any kind of
<br>
platform. The cost is so low and the concept so simple it is hard to
<br>
predict where and how this technology will be used.&quot;
