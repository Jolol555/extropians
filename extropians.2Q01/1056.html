Yes! Yes! Yes!
<br>
<p>This news item:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2001/319/2">http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2001/319/2</a>
<br>
says a group lead by RIKEN's Genomic Sciences Center in Yokohama,
<br>
Japan, with centers from Germany, China, Taiwan, and Korea is
<br>
planning to tackle the chimp genome.  They can probably do this
<br>
for a few tens of millions of dollars because they can simply
<br>
overlay much of it on the human genome (and therefore do not
<br>
have to do as much redundant sequencing to assemble the whole
<br>
sequence.)
<br>
<p>This is *very* good.  Why?  Because having it is going to give
<br>
us some pretty good insights into (a) the genes that promote
<br>
higher intelligence; (b) the genes that promote communication
<br>
(e.g. speech); (c) the genes that produce our longevity which
<br>
is about twice that of the chimps.
<br>
<p>It also means now that all of the major organisms are complete,
<br>
being completed or spoken for -- Human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, Fugu,
<br>
all the major bacteria that cause human diseases, all the major
<br>
protozoa that cause human disease (and their carriers),
<br>
Drosophila, C. Elegans and several yeast.
<br>
<p>When those are all done, the stage will be set for the 2nd tier
<br>
organisms -- those that I listed at Extro 4 as useful because
<br>
they have already invented novel solutions to the problems
<br>
that need to be solved for slowly aging or non-aging organisms.
<br>
If I and some others have any say in motivating the people
<br>
at the various genome centers these will be the next set
<br>
of organisms to be sequenced.
<br>
<p>And since people like &quot;predictions&quot;, I'd say no later than
<br>
2004 should you see at least one of these started and no
<br>
later than 2007 should you see one or more of them finished.
<br>
