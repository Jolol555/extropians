Sr. Gonzalia's description of economic and social conditions in Argentina is 
<br>
consistent with what I've observed in other Latin American &quot;Second World&quot; 
<br>
countries in my work and travels over the last 20 years and presents a strong 
<br>
challenge to the program we support as extropians.  Yes, technological 
<br>
progress ought to create opportunities for addressing many of the problems we 
<br>
see manifest over and over again in societies that have seemed to be trapped 
<br>
for so long in a kind of static &quot;quasi-modern&quot; state.  (See Gabriel 
<br>
Garcia-Marquez' &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; and &quot;The Autumn of the 
<br>
Patriarch&quot; for moving depictions of this kind of timeless, frozen condition 
<br>
in such societies and the people who live in them.)  But I've come to 
<br>
conclude that there are some common phenomena that are essentially skew to 
<br>
issues of technological progress that cripple societies as seemingly 
<br>
disparate as Argentina, Chile and Brazil in South America and Thailand, 
<br>
Malaysia and Indonesia in Southeast Asia.
<br>
<p>Working to understand and change the things that have caused this kind of 
<br>
static condition is just as or perhaps more important than working to 
<br>
introduce new technologies into such societies and improving the basic 
<br>
conditions of material life.  What is it that societies as disparate as those 
<br>
we find in Colombia, Nigeria and Burma have in common that has held them back 
<br>
from the benefits of real modernism?  Why have attempts to aid development in 
<br>
these countries proved so ineffective for so long?  Looking at places where 
<br>
modernism has had a false start seems to me to be as important as studying 
<br>
those where it has been most successful.
