<p>
Some friends and I bumped into the UFO Raël cult today, and discussed a bit
<br>
with one of their representatives -- mainly because of their list of
<br>
political opinions. The point is that most of you _WILL_ find this list
<br>
rather familiar -- I recognized myself all to well in it:
<br>
<p>- nanotech is coming and it is good!
<br>
- biotech is here and it is good!
<br>
- human cloning is good!            (CloneAid is a Raël business)
<br>
- contraceptives are good!
<br>
- the right to abortion is good!
<br>
- informed euthanasia should be legal!
<br>
- internet should be completely free
<br>
- schooling should be performed electronically
<br>
- homosexual marriage and adoption rights
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>They also move out rather strongly pro individual freedom with emphasise on
<br>
morphological ditto.
<br>
<p>Now, the main problem with UFO Raël, and one of the main things that places
<br>
it in the 'cult' slot instead of being a member of the WTA is that they
<br>
build their belief on the opinion that all life on earth is descended from a
<br>
test conducted by posthuman aliens (their description matches most of our
<br>
posthuman ideas pretty well...), and that these posthumans are currently
<br>
awaiting an embassy, complete with diplomatic immunity etc. to be
<br>
constructed on earth in order for them to return to the now mature Human
<br>
race. We even found out that they have (according to their representant)
<br>
advanced plans with the Brasilian government to build that embassy in
<br>
Brazil.
<br>
This rather irrational UFO belief is practically what (for me) draws the
<br>
line that places them as New Age Cultist and us as Rational Transhumanists.
<br>
<p>The problem though is that these are the people doing something! These are
<br>
the people that are visible with their actions!
<br>
They've started ClonAid. They have human cloning underway. They are very
<br>
visible in Stockholm (on account of them standing around all day with large
<br>
posters and telling everyone about them).
<br>
<p>It seems to me as if we're about to lose the definition privilege. The ideas
<br>
that we've been talking about the last decade or so, and where much of the
<br>
debate has been about us seeing these things so early that we set the
<br>
playfield, are propagating and fast. This would be a good thing, BUT the
<br>
ideas are propagated in the hands of crackpots, and being that they run a
<br>
VERY serious risk of receiving the crackpot mark themselves.
<br>
If all the public have heard of nanotech, biotech, cloning etc etc is that
<br>
some strange UFO-cult are strongly in favour of them, what would that make
<br>
us when we are strongly in favour of the same things?
<br>
<p>Can we afford that they are visible and we are not?
<br>
<p>Can we afford that they are visible?
