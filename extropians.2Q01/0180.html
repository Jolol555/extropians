<p>A Map For The Future: Fundamental Limit Defines Future Opportunities For 
<br>
Silicon Nanoelectronics
<br>
<p>Electronics researchers have defined a fundamental limit that will help 
<br>
extend a half-century's progress in producing ever-smaller microelectronic 
<br>
devices for increasingly more powerful and less expensive computerized 
<br>
equipment.
<br>
The fundamental limit defines the minimum amount of energy needed to perform 
<br>
the most basic computing operation: binary logic switching that changes a 0 
<br>
to a 1 or vice-versa. This limit provides the foundation for determining a 
<br>
set of higher-level boundaries on materials, devices, circuits and systems 
<br>
that will define future opportunities for miniaturization advances possible 
<br>
through traditional microelectronics -- and its further extension to 
<br>
nanoelectronics.
<br>
<p>&quot;Future opportunities for gigascale integration (chips containing up to a 
<br>
billion devices) and even terascale integration (chips containing trillions 
<br>
of devices) will be governed by a hierarchy of physical limits,&quot; said James 
<br>
D. Meindl, professor of electrical and computer engineering and director of 
<br>
the Microelectronics Research Center at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
<br>
&quot;We now know the fundamental limit on microelectronics and where we are 
<br>
relative to it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meindl explained the limits and their implications on February 16 in a 
<br>
seminar on nanotechnology at the 167th annual meeting of the American 
<br>
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in San Francisco.
<br>
<p>Meindl and collaborator Jeffrey A. Davis reported in the October issue of 
<br>
IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits that the fundamental limit depends on 
<br>
just a single variable: the absolute temperature. Based on this fundamental 
<br>
limit, however, engineers can derive a hierarchy of limits that are much 
<br>
less absolute because they depend on assumptions about the operation of 
<br>
devices, circuits and systems.
<br>
<p>The researchers studied the fundamental limit from two different 
<br>
perspectives: the minimum energy required to produce a binary transition 
<br>
that can be distinguished, and the minimum energy necessary for sending the 
<br>
resulting signal along a communications channel. The result was the same in 
<br>
both cases.
<br>
<p>The fundamental limit, expressed as E(min) = (ln2)kT, was first reported 50 
<br>
years ago by electrical engineer John von Neumann, who never provided an 
<br>
explanation for its derivation. (In this equation, T represents absolute 
<br>
temperature, k is Boltzmann's constant, and ln2 is the natural log of 2).
<br>
<p>Though this fundamental limit provides the theoretical stopping point for 
<br>
electrical and computer engineers, Meindl says no future device will ever 
<br>
operate close to it. That's because device designers will first bump into 
<br>
the higher-level limits -- and economic realities.
<br>
<p>For example, electronic signals can move through interconnects no faster 
<br>
than the speed of light. And quantum mechanical theory introduces 
<br>
uncertainties that would make devices smaller than a certain size 
<br>
impractical.
<br>
<p>Beyond that is a more important issue -- devices operating at the 
<br>
fundamental limit would be wrong as often as they are right.
<br>
<p>&quot;The probability of making an error while operating at this fundamental 
<br>
limit of energy transfer in a binary transition is one-half,&quot; Meindl noted. 
<br>
&quot;In other words, if you are operating just above the limit, you'll be right 
<br>
most of the time, but if you are operating just below it, you'd be wrong 
<br>
most of the time.&quot;
<br>
<p>What does this mean for electronic and computer engineers?
<br>
<p>&quot;We can expect another 10 to 15 years of the exponential pace of the past 40 
<br>
years in reducing cost per function, improving productivity and improving 
<br>
performance,&quot; Meindl said. &quot;There will be lots of problems to solve and 
<br>
inventions that will be needed, just as they have over the past four 
<br>
decades.&quot;
<br>
<p>He expects the world's use of silicon will follow the pattern set by its use 
<br>
of steel. During the second half of the 19th century, steel use increased 
<br>
exponentially as the world built its industrial infrastructure. Growth in 
<br>
steel demand fell after that, but it remains the backbone of world 
<br>
economies, though other materials increasingly challenge it.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the middle of the 21st century, we are going to be using more silicon 
<br>
than we are now, by far,&quot; he predicted. &quot;There will be other materials that 
<br>
will come in to replace it, like plastics and aluminum came in to push steel 
<br>
out of certain applications. But we don't know yet what will replace 
<br>
silicon.&quot;
<br>
<p>Though the limits provide a final barrier to innovation, Meindl believes 
<br>
economic realities will bring about the real end to advances in 
<br>
microelectronics.
<br>
<p>&quot;What has enabled the computer revolution so far is that the cost per 
<br>
function has continued to decrease,&quot; he said. &quot;It is likely that after a 
<br>
certain point, we will not be able to continue to increase productivity. We 
<br>
may no longer be able to see investment pay off in reduced cost per 
<br>
function.&quot;
<br>
<p>Beyond that point, designers will depend on nanotechnology for continuing 
<br>
advances in miniaturization.
<br>
<p>&quot;What happens next is what nanotechnology research is trying to answer,&quot; he 
<br>
said. &quot;Work that is going on in nanotechnology today is trying to create a 
<br>
discontinuity and jump to a brand new science and technology base. 
<br>
Fundamental physical limits encourage the hypothesis that silicon technology 
<br>
provides a singular opportunity for exploration of nanoelectronics.&quot;
