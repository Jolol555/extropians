Regarding Robin's paper, <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a>...
<br>
<p>&quot;A similar argument applies to a group of agents. If the group is to
<br>
avoid combinations of bets that are guarantee losses, then each group
<br>
member must offer the same betting odds on every proposition.&quot;
<br>
<p>Since groups don't do this, there must be bets we outsiders can make
<br>
with group members that are guaranteed profitable.  But they are not
<br>
obvious.
<br>
<p>For example, some people think Amazon.com will fail, others think it
<br>
will thrive.  These people have different ideas about the fair value of
<br>
the company's stock today.  Theoretically I could buy stock cheaply from
<br>
the first group and sell it expensively to the second.  But in practice
<br>
I can't, because those groups can get a better deal in the stock market.
<br>
<p>Of course for most issues there is no existing market, but in principle
<br>
you could create an Idea Futures market for virtually any issue on which
<br>
people disagree.
<br>
<p>What does the existence of markets and market prices say about the
<br>
existence of disagreement?  Why don't people pour all of their resources
<br>
into markets where they disagree that the current market-clearing price
<br>
is correct?  Presumably people find most market prices to be &quot;incorrect&quot;
<br>
to some degree, almost all the time.
<br>
<p>Can this be explained because people aren't as confident in their beliefs
<br>
as they like to think that they are?  They're &quot;sure&quot; that the stock is
<br>
underpriced or overpriced, but when it comes time to put their money down,
<br>
suddenly they are not so sure.
<br>
<p>If so, then perhaps the existence of an IF market would make people more
<br>
aware of their true (lack of) certainty about their beliefs.
<br>
