<br>
<p>WOLF RECOVERY PROGRAM IS A BUREAUCRATIC SHAM, ECOLOGIST CLAIMS
<br>
Given the popularity of wildlife calendars sold each year by environmental
<br>
organizations, these groups clearly know a sellable cause when they see one.
<br>
Unfortunately, the politics of wildlife protection sometimes runs roughshod
<br>
over the science of wildlife protection.
<br>
<p>To reduce political opposition from hunters and ranchers, for example, the
<br>
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) significantly understated the number
<br>
of wolves it hoped to reintroduce to the northern Rocky Mountains --
<br>
downplaying the wolves' likely impact on mule deer and other potential prey,
<br>
according to Charles Kay, a wildlife ecologist and research fellow at The
<br>
Independent Institute, in a report on wolf recovery now available on the
<br>
Institute's website.
<br>
<p>The USFWS stated that only 300 wolves were needed for sustainable recovery.
<br>
But based on information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Kay
<br>
says that &quot;the agency has failed to conduct or review the appropriate
<br>
studies to justify this number.&quot;
<br>
<p>To maintain a sustainable, genetically diverse wolf population, Kay
<br>
estimates that 1500 to 2000 wolves would need to be reintroduced.  But
<br>
because wolf populations can reproduce quickly and disperse hundreds of
<br>
miles, a seed population this large would threaten deer, elk and livestock
<br>
herds throughout the entire northern Rockies.
<br>
<p>Kay also argues that the agency's small-scale wolf recovery program begun in
<br>
Yellowstone National Park a few years ago will endear photogenic wolf pups
<br>
to the public, increasing political support for larger recovery programs and
<br>
a larger budget for the agency.
<br>
<p>Kay views this as a political maneuver by a self-interested bureaucracy more
<br>
concerned with gaining power than with protecting endangered species.
<br>
Unfortunately, says Kay, other environmental agencies also have misplaced
<br>
priorities.
<br>
<p>&quot;Currently about $100 million is being spent annually by state and federal
<br>
agencies to protect endangered species.  Over one-half of the total, though,
<br>
goes to less than two percent of the species listed as threatened or
<br>
endangered,&quot; writes Kay.
<br>
<p>&quot;Instead of spending its budget on the animals and plants most in need of
<br>
protection, the agencies spend their funds on 'charismatic megafauna' such
<br>
as grizzly bears and wolves.  This may garner the agencies public support,
<br>
but it does little to protect the majority of endangered species,&quot; Kay
<br>
concludes.
