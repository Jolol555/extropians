It's not clear from Eugene's letter if he is actually cancelling his
<br>
cryonics contract or just eliminating a degree of &quot;active&quot; participation.
<br>
I think it would be unwise to do the former and would be an unfortunate
<br>
overreaction to the problems in the cryonics community.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I am amazed at how bad-tempered, rude, ill-mannered and
<br>
unlikeable the members of the community appear to be, at least in
<br>
their online personas.  With such a small group of people, who face such
<br>
overwhelming external threats, you would think they would recognize their
<br>
common interests and band together for survival.  Instead you see insults,
<br>
feuds, back-stabbing, tremendous negativity.
<br>
<p>It's gotten to the point where I'd suggest that active participation
<br>
in the cryonics community is detrimental to your long-term survival.
<br>
I unsubscribed to cryonet years ago and my peace of mind has been far
<br>
greater as a result.  I don't think it is healthy to expose yourself to
<br>
the stress and tension which is provoked by engaging in bitter online
<br>
battles (even vicariously).  You're reducing the quality of your life
<br>
and potentially your healthy lifespan as well.
<br>
<p>And in the extreme you may be goaded to take measures like cutting off
<br>
your involvement with cryonics entirely.  (Whether Eugene has done this
<br>
or not, the point remains that it can happen.)  Even though this may seem
<br>
like a completely justified action in the context of an ongoing dispute,
<br>
from the larger perspective it can only hurt your chances of survival,
<br>
and that should be the bottom line for this kind of decision.
<br>
<p>I am a passive cryonics client.  I subscribed years ago, I pay my dues,
<br>
and I let the company worry about the rest.  I feel that to take a more
<br>
active role would end up being harmful to my long-term prospects, as I
<br>
explained above.  I sacrifice a certain incremental improvement in my
<br>
prospects by possibly not having the absolute best cryonics arrangement
<br>
possible.  But I gain peace of mind and tranquility, and in the long
<br>
run these are healthy and life-enhancing attributes that I value.
