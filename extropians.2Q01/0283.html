<p><p>Genetic Tinkering Is Found to Extend Roundworms' Lives
<br>
<p>By REUTERS
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Scientists say they have extended the life span of an animal — though just a 
<br>
worm — by tinkering with its genetic makeup. The findings could one day lead 
<br>
to drugs that help humans live longer, researchers said.
<br>
<p>Roundworms normally die at about two weeks old, but after researchers at 
<br>
M.I.T. gave the tiny creatures extra copies of chromosomes containing a 
<br>
specific gene, they lived up to three weeks, or 50 percent longer.
<br>
<p>The researchers, led by Leonard Guarente and Heidi Tissenbaum, report their 
<br>
results today in the journal Nature.
<br>
<p>Scientists have known for decades that the key to extending life spans in 
<br>
yeast, worms, mice and possibly primates is restricting calories to a 
<br>
fraction of their normal levels.
<br>
<p>Based on his earlier studies with yeast, Dr. Guarente has suggested that 
<br>
this effect occurred because of the interaction between metabolism and a 
<br>
gene that shuts down other genes. He has shown that yeast with two copies of 
<br>
this SIR2 gene lived longer and that yeast without it had a shorter life 
<br>
span.
<br>
<p>In the new study, Dr. Guarente and colleagues showed that a similar gene, 
<br>
SIR2.1, had the same effect on a higher organism, the roundworm. The result 
<br>
suggests that similar genes could be linked to aging in all organisms, 
<br>
including humans, they said.

<br>
<p>&quot;The big question is the mechanism by which that works. How does that confer 
<br>
longevity? That's what we are trying to get at here. Our proposal is that 
<br>
this could be at least part of the answer to that question,&quot; Dr. Guarente 
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>In the yeast studies, the scientists showed that the effect of SIR2 on aging 
<br>
is linked to nutrition and metabolic rate. They suspect the same is true 
<br>
with worms.
