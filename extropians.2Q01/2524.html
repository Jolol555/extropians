Brian,
<br>
<p>I think that unions serve a very important purpose by increasing the
<br>
bargaining power of individuals whose bargaining power alone is too weak
<br>
to change bad employment practices.  I also admire the courage that many
<br>
union leaders have shown when forming unions.
<br>
<p>I'm also happy to see that the AFL-CIO is beginning to call for &quot;...the
<br>
repeal of employer sanctions, for a new amnesty for the undocumented,
<br>
and for a broad new program to educate immigrant workers about their
<br>
rights.....&quot;  ( <a href="http://www.ncmonline.com/commentary/2000-02-25/afl.html">http://www.ncmonline.com/commentary/2000-02-25/afl.html</a>
<br>
).  Prior to this new
<br>
position, it struck me as odd that unions work to make it more difficult
<br>
for sweatshop workers to escape to an environment where better pay and
<br>
working conditions are available.

<p>The median annual income in the U.S. is roughly $30,000 dollars; the
<br>
median annual world income is about $8,000 dollars.  If one were
<br>
concerned about the suffering of the working poor, then wouldn't it be
<br>
better to buy from someone making $8 K/year than $30 K/year?  (Assuming
<br>
that they're not working under &quot;sweatshop&quot; conditions.)

<p>Yes, I agree.  I think that you got tarred with the &quot;jingoist&quot; brush
<br>
(<a href="http://projects.ghostwheel.com/dictionary?define=nationalistic">http://projects.ghostwheel.com/dictionary?define=nationalistic</a>)
<br>
because you mentioned that you wanted to start a &quot;Made in the USA&quot;
<br>
store.  Your criteria for purchasing goods seemed to be based primarily
<br>
on the happenstance of location, rather than what would actually help
<br>
the working class the most.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that it would help more workers improve their standard of
<br>
living if you started a &quot;Sweatshop Free&quot; store
<br>
that purchased goods from companies that employed workers from poor
<br>
countries, but who treated their workers well.   (as, for example,  The
<br>
Body Shop appears to do)
<br>
<p>It's also unclear to me that boycotting companies who employ children
<br>
working under sweatshop conditions will necessarily improve the lot of
<br>
those children.  Let's assume that the boycott is successful, and the
<br>
company goes out of business.  What happens next?  What do you expect
<br>
will replace the income (pittance that it was) that the child earned?
<br>
