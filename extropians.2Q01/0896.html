<p>Nope, sorry.  Once we reach the level where we drive our own self-evolution,
<br>
we *MUST* mutate &quot;ourselves&quot; (e.g. self-copies) and run those copies forward
<br>
along the time line to see if they are &quot;better&quot; versions.  If the mutants have
<br>
appealing survival characteristics, you then load those changes back into your
<br>
&quot;real&quot; version.  The degree to which you may self-evolve to a higher level may
<br>
depend crucially on your ability to endure your own self-induced misery.  [Which is
<br>
precisely how it is today because if you feel your life is miserable, you are making
<br>
a clear choice to &quot;feel&quot; that way (whether you believe that statement or not
<br>
{because most of you won't} it *is* true).  Your ability to &quot;tolerate&quot; any
<br>
self-perceived misery in your life presumably is one of the major factors
<br>
that keeps you from ending it.]
<br>
<p>Now of course you don't &quot;have&quot; to participate in this sado-masochistic ritual.
<br>
But if you can't &quot;bear&quot; the thought of causing your self-copies misery, you will
<br>
most probably become economically marginalized and eventually suffer some fatal
<br>
accident (even in a nano-enhanced form).  [One will probably live many thousands or
<br>
tens of thousands of years and most likely get pretty bored (unless boredom turns
<br>
out to be correctable by drugs or mind-&quot;managing&quot; nanobots).]
<br>
<p>Bottom line:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolution is ruthless it doesn't care about &quot;misery&quot; it only cares about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;successful designs.  And in the universe, as I see it developing, its
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;going to be evolve, perish or become irrelevant.
<br>
<p>The only advantage of &quot;simulated&quot; self-misery, is if you are doing it on yourself
<br>
you know you made the choice to be there and you know it isn't really &quot;real&quot;.
<br>
(of course there may be times when you have to hide that fact from &quot;yourself&quot;).
