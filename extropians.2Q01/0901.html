<p>Cool name.  I'll start by pointing out that this is a variant
<br>
on the Pohl and Williamson &quot;The Saga of the Cuckoo&quot; (aka
<br>
&quot;The Farthest Star&quot; + &quot;Wall Around a Star&quot;).  In that design
<br>
I think they were circulating very high velocity fluid streams.

<p><em>&gt; I suggest mag lev mass drivers in place of the particle beams because

</em><br>
<p>I know electrons do this, do protons do it as well?  Are their any
<br>
loses when you turn something magnetic using a magnetic field?
<br>
(e.g. do you slow the turning particles down so they have to be
<br>
reaccelerated?   If so where does that energy go?)
<br>
<p>I had considered this approach before to &quot;sustain&quot; a hyper-heavy JBrain.
<br>
HHJB's are JBrains constructed in such a way that they would melt
<br>
or crush into atomic homogeneity their interiors.  I thought momentum
<br>
transfer of the type you describe could provide loopholes to squeeze
<br>
though to expand the size of the JBrain but I was worried about heat
<br>
production (that costs a lot to radiate in a JBrain).
<br>
<p>You get into an interesting problem constructing the &quot;fiber-core&quot; for
<br>
the JBrain architecture that Anders has proposed in that as you add
<br>
additional material on the outside the pressure on the fibers goes
<br>
up significantly -- at what point does your fibers start to
<br>
deform and intermix with each other?   Can you construct
<br>
it slowly enough and construct fibers with sufficiently low
<br>
losses that heat doesn't build up in the core?  Or do you
<br>
simply ignore these issues and support all of the outer
<br>
mass on momentum &quot;fountains&quot;?
