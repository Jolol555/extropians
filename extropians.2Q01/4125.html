<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, Eliezer, you have not yet fully outgrown your

<em>&gt; &gt; religious roots ;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What on Earth is that comment supposed to be about?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About the implicit assumption that in the default case, there is *a* better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way rather than being a multiplicity of ways each with their own advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and disadvantages...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One true God, one true keyboard layout... one true path to AI ... you've
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's quite right.  I didn't leave Judaism because of a decision
<br>
that there was no one true religion; I left Judaism because it was WRONG. 
<br>
It made assertions that are, unambiguously, factually untrue.
<br>
<p>There are, of course, many cases where there is no one true way.  I am
<br>
totally uninterested in having a preference in such cases, except where it
<br>
reflects a personal taste of some kind, in which case I am uninterested in
<br>
trying to persuade others of my personal taste.  There's no point in
<br>
trying to communicate an opinion to others unless it's an objective fact,
<br>
or the unambiguous result of objective facts plus panhuman cognition or
<br>
audience-majority common assumptions.
<br>
<p>In other words, there's a selection bias in my verbal outputs.  I have no
<br>
interest in trying to convince you what kind of pizza to order.  Dvorak,
<br>
however, is unambiguously better than Qwerty.
<br>
<p>As for your assertion that my distaste for cultural relativism is
<br>
religiously derived, does that mean that science, which states that
<br>
Einstein's theory is THE law of gravitation and superior to any law of
<br>
gravitation that uses an inverse-cube law, is religiously derived?
<br>
<p>Cultural relativism is not a means of finding truth; it is an excuse for
<br>
avoiding the social discomfort that sometimes accompanies the act of
<br>
expressing an uncomfortable truth or a truth which is not widely held. 
<br>
Cultural relativism is a defection in the game known as Finding the
<br>
Truth.  Things can get better only if people are willing to speak the
<br>
words &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The thing is that there is just not enough objective data to choose between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two political parties as similar as the ones we have in the US.  So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice largely comes down to bias, or habit.
</em><br>
<p>There are more than two parties.  And if you don't have a strong reason,
<br>
or even a weak reason, to prefer one candidate over another, then you
<br>
shouldn't vote in that contest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2)  Do you have the same religion you were brought up in?  They can't all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be right, can they?  Would that strategy really work if everyone used it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a sense, religions can all be right.  I'm not religious as you know.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the benefits conferred on people by believing in religion may be largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent of the particular religion in question.
</em><br>
<p>My personal philosophy is unambiguous on this topic; it says &quot;You
<br>
shouldn't believe something because it benefits you; you should believe
<br>
things because they're true.&quot;  When I come across a force that could mess
<br>
this up, such as an evolutionary selection pressure that translates into a
<br>
cognitive pressure on what people believe, I do my best to counteract the
<br>
cognitive pressure to maintain clarity of reflection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nietzsche said &quot;People believe what they need to believe in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Screw him.  Science isn't somebody's opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3)  WHY THE HELL AREN'T YOU USING A DVORAK KEYBOARD?  Did you even TRY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it?  Just once in your life?  Doesn't continuing to use Qwerty indicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that sheer mental inertia is just about the only driving factor in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Frankly, no.  Sheer mental inertia is not just about the only driving factor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are also the ever-present cravings for sex, food, and water.
</em><br>
<p>Ben, take a stand on something.  You'll feel better.
