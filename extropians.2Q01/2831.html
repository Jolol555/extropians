cites:  &quot;But growing numbers of farmers, scientists and concerned citizens 
<br>
disagree, citing new hazards to our health and the environment, along with 
<br>
troubling ethical questions.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But isn't that a most interesting comment.  Couldn't we have said the 
<br>
same thing about the airplane?  Basically, those same things were said about 
<br>
the magnetic telegraph as it was initially known.  I strongly suspect the 
<br>
same things could have been said about the radio, the automobile, the clipper 
<br>
ship, the steam engine.  The alphabet and writing were roundly criticized for 
<br>
the nagative effects they had on the ability of people to memorize material 
<br>
and the powers of the mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is not those older inventions were criticized but that they 
<br>
could and probably were criticized in exactly the same terms as are being 
<br>
used to day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, I could criticize my initial attraction to my first wife in those 
<br>
terms.  &quot;...citing new hazards to our mental and financial health and 
<br>
domestic environment, along with troubling ethical questions.&quot;
