<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The problem is that we can make predictions that apply outside particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; accelerators - for example, that radioactive isotopes of potassium will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;decay at certain rates.  And they do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yes but only when you look at the radioactive isotopes of potassium ; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;don't know about you but I haven't done that in, gee, it must have been
</em><br>
days.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people look at that everyday.  And if were different, it would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences for mutation rates, etc.  The geiger counter in my lab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to influence minicircle mutations of the cells I work with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or would that only be when it's on?  Did the rules of the universe change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last month when it was out of spec?  Are you really serious about this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &gt;Everywhere we look these rules  are being followed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But what about far more numerous places we haven't looked?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Place we don't or haven't looked often produce consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &gt; To know in advance all possible consequences of a simplification to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &gt; rules and know that will produce no contradictions implies a
</em><br>
knowledge
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &gt; of the future incompatible with a sim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Is there any reason to think that our world contains no contradictions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's done a remarkable good job of appearing to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fundamentally, these arguments are the same as a last resort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creationists.  They say God &quot;poofed&quot; the world into existence 6K
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago with all the evidence for 15 gigayears, evolution, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually I'd say your arguments are less plausible; at least they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have God *currently* running mad tweaks when I turn on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my geiger counter!  Scientific thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depends on acknowlegement that the world is; if somebody holds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a faith in contravention of all possible evidence against it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's to say?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>These kind of hypothesis can actually sit quite comfortably alongside
<br>
science. Science is only an accumulation of knowledge about actions, and
<br>
measurements of outcomes supposedly related to those actions.
<br>
<p>Occams' razor undoubtedly slashes away the simulation theory. But that is
<br>
only for practical purposes! Occams' razor and science in general claim
<br>
nothing about the *real* state of things. They are about building a
<br>
workable, consistent model of reality. The blueprint for a sim, even!
<br>
<p>We can make no argument against the possibility that the world is a sim,
<br>
based on measured outcomes, because we cannot know what resources an
<br>
outer-layer has. They may very well be able to sim everything, or only
<br>
locally perceived things, tweaking here and there, providing depth as
<br>
necessary.
<br>
<p>We deny ideas such as the sim, or God creating the universe recently to
<br>
trick us (urh, test our faith?),for purely aesthetic &amp; practical reasons.
<br>
It's just a lot more elegant, and useable, to say that the universe just is,
<br>
and there's no trickery involved. But if it turned out to be the case
<br>
tomorrow that we really were in a sim (say the simmers popped in to say hi),
<br>
then the work of science is not undermined, in so far as we can expect the
<br>
rules of the universe to remain studiable. Science does usually involve a
<br>
claim, I think, that the rules don't change, which might start to look
<br>
shaky, but there will then be meta rules (the rules of the outside world)
<br>
which we can look to.
<br>
<p>The line of reasoning about the MWI, and the statistical improbability of us
<br>
not being a sim, is quite ingenious. I think it's got legs... lets see how
<br>
far it can run. If it does begin to look substantial, the ever fickle Occam
<br>
may begin to aim his straight blade at our existing, ill defined
<br>
assumptions; that our universe is the &quot;real&quot; one, whatever that means.
