<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that one of the consequences of a mature molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology is that manufacturing technologies spread like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crazy: physical goods tend towards the state of software, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-informational replication costs directly proportional to mass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mineralogical availability, and energy. This in turn suggests that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working nanotechnology industrial base with replicators can very rapidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise the availability of material goods throughout the third world to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least the level we in the developed world are accustomed to.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But the timeframe is extremely important here. Three billion
<br>
people (!) are right now living in countries making good progress
<br>
towards industrialisation and first world living standards. They have
<br>
far to go, but things are happening on an enormous scale. The effects
<br>
of nanotechnology will be very different if it appears in the early,
<br>
middle or late part of this process. It is also interesting for us,
<br>
since we might not want to be around the pollution peak that seems to
<br>
occur in mid-industrialisation - if a shortcut in production and
<br>
development can be provided, it would be great. 
<br>
<p>Nanotech in early industrialisation: a chance for a great leap
<br>
forward, sidestepping traditional industry - but can it be applied, do
<br>
people have the right skills to employ it, will it be economically
<br>
available? The sheer jump might cause instability as societies move
<br>
into not just the somewhat understood industrial era but into the same
<br>
unknown as even the most developing world would be struggling with. 
<br>
<p>Nanotech in mid industrialisation: already made investments will
<br>
become irrelevant or incorporate nanotech in new ways; a good chance
<br>
to see truly cyberpunkish technological chimeras.
<br>
<p>Nanotech in late industrialisation: likely less disruptive, just
<br>
helping to speed along an already quickly expanding economy. Expect
<br>
the general optimism of the society to explode outwards.
<br>
<p>Information technology introduction might give us some hints. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, given that a lot of the political conflicts, famines, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpleasantnesses we live with today are scarcity-related, doesn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sense to try to understand how two thirds of the human species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will respond to technologies that promise to make most of the roots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict magically go away?
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your view about the need for understanding new
<br>
technologies in different cultural contexts, but I would say the the
<br>
problems above are not magically solved by even strong
<br>
nanotech. Scarcity is not just an issue of lack of resources or
<br>
production capacity, it is also an issue of distribution and economic
<br>
system. Under a Rob Mugabe even a nanotech society might starve. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There's a complicating factor, though. Just as legislative infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the west is dominated by Christian ideas of moral behaviour, so are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislative systems in the non-Christian world dominated by other belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems. Even if the people living there don't actively believe, the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their systems have developed have their roots in a religious culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the strength of Sunday-opening laws for shops in various parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the west, or the way the institution of marriage is handled. Societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a western take on these may not be inhabited by fundamentalists, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those laws were put into shape by a predominantly Christian-influenced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislature at some time in the past.
</em><br>
<p>A good example is reproductive rights, and reproductive
<br>
technologies.
