Actually, even in the uploading case, it doesn't matter.
<br>
<p>Consider a situation where you're going to die, no matter what, in
<br>
five minutes.  You have the option, however, of sacrificing your life
<br>
a minute early so that a very imperfect copy of you can be created and
<br>
live on.
<br>
<p>So, either five minutes, no copy, or four minutes, with a copy.  The
<br>
choice to me seems clear, no matter WHAT your views on identity,
<br>
qualia, and the effectiveness of immortality-via-backup are.
<br>
<p>But this view can be extended and made probabilistic.  Remember, if
<br>
immortality-via-backup will fail, then you're *definitely* going to
<br>
die, at some point.  Given an arbitrary amount of time, any
<br>
arbitrarily large physical system will fail eventually.
<br>
<p>Now suppose that qualia considerations rule out any possibility that
<br>
an uploaded version of you is really you.  It's somebody else, no
<br>
matter how good the copy.  (I don't think this is right, but it really
<br>
doesn't matter.)  Suppose as well that tomorrow I present you with the
<br>
option to undergo a destructive upload, which will destroy you, but
<br>
allow some copy or copies of you to live on forever (or orders of
<br>
magnitude longer than you'll ever live, it hardly matters.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the perspective of infinity, *any* time slice, be it millions or
</em><br>
even billions of years, is far far less than the order of one spare
<br>
minute out of five.  From that perspective, you're doomed to die
<br>
shortly.  Agreeing to a destructive upload is like agreeing to shorten
<br>
your life by a minute so that a copy, however bad, may succeed you.
<br>
<p>So, even if you have the most essentialist views possible about qualia,
<br>
and claim that uploading your own (same) consciousness into a computer
<br>
is impossible, you should still undergo a destructive upload if given
<br>
the opportunity.
<br>
<p>(Of course, this post overlooks all sorts of other possibilities which
<br>
might get in your way, but considerations of that kind in no way turn
<br>
on the question of qualia, so they may be abstracted away for the
<br>
purposes of this example.  For example, if the copies were no more
<br>
likely to live longer than you, then even the most hard-core
<br>
functionalist should refuse to destructively upload.)
