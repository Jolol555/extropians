Well, I don't know how extropian probability questions are and do they
<br>
belong on this list?  Maybe they do, since they exercise our brains and thus
<br>
prevent Alsenheimer's...
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin says:
<br>
<em>&gt; 2.  A little girl's father discovers that his wife is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     pregnant again (but they don't know the sex of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     unborn child).  The man decides to visit a mathematician.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;I have two children, sir&quot;, he says, &quot;and one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     is a girl.  What is the probability that the other is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a boy?&quot;  What did the mathematician tell him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***Answers***   For problems 1, 2, and 3, the answer is 2/3.  For
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with this one.  (As you see I am trying to be diplomatic here
<br>
)  ).
<br>
<p>First, one of course assumes that sexes are equally probable (they aren't),
<br>
otherwise this would not be an interesting little problem.
<br>
<p>One has to be careful about formulation of the problem.  Lee wants to ask
<br>
&quot;given that there is at least one girl, what is the probability that there
<br>
is one boy and one girl&quot;.  The answer to this is of course 2/3, just as Lee
<br>
claims.
<br>
<p>However, this is not what Lee is really asking.  Note the pair of phrases:
<br>
&quot;one&quot;, and &quot;the other&quot;.  What the father is really asking is &quot;I have picked
<br>
one of my children (not necessarily at random). That child is a girl.  What
<br>
is the probability that the other child is a boy&quot;.  To this question the
<br>
answer is 1/2.
