<em>&gt; Long, long ago, in the summer of my 11th year, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whiled away some of my vacation reading the Bantam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paperback of Daniel F. Galouye's _Simulacron-3_ (1964),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I google was the basis for _The 13th Floor_ (I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen the movie).  The paperback has the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lurid teaser on the front endpage:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hall switched the car to auto-guide and put his arm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around the girl.  They purred softly up a hill, into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknown countryside.  Then, a blast of icy terror tore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at Hall.  He hit the braking stud--
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The road ended a hundred feet away!
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this does sound like that scene from The 13th Floor, when the people
<br>
in the VR discover that it has a limited extent.
<br>
<p>I remember reading a few short stories from that era with a similar idea
<br>
- not so much about living in VR, but more about being characters in a
<br>
simulated/engineered reality.
<br>
<p>In one story, a guy was paranoid and convinced that the world was arranged
<br>
to try to fool him, that it was just a stage and behind the scenes nothing
<br>
was as it seemed.  One time when he was young he remembered looking
<br>
out the front door and seeing a stormy cloud-filled sky, then looking
<br>
out the back door and seeing a beautiful day without a cloud present.
<br>
Of course the kicker was that it turned out to be true.  This was perhaps
<br>
somewhat prescient of The Truman Show.
<br>
<p>In another story, the main character always had bad luck.  If there was
<br>
a banana peel, he'd trip on it.  If a little kid went by eating an ice
<br>
cream cone, it would end up in the guy's face, etc.  It turned out that
<br>
he was the comic sidekick in a story which aliens were creating using
<br>
earthlings as unwitting cast members.
