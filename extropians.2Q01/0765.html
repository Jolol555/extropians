<p>Actually, Dyson's letter to Science was rather poorly written (IMO)
<br>
because he leaves enough open for interpretation that it could be and
<br>
was misinterpreted before the ink was even dry.  Science News Letters
<br>
called it a &quot;hollow ball&quot; within a couple of weeks and several letters
<br>
to Science objected to that architecture.  Dyson qualified in his
<br>
response that he had intended orbiting satellites.  The Russians
<br>
probably didn't read this because they later produced several papers
<br>
showing a ball was impossible for different reasons but that satellites
<br>
would work fine.  This later showed up in discussions comparing
<br>
Tsiolkovsky's &quot;Etherial Cities&quot; with Dyson shells.
<br>
<p>I asked Dyson if he thought he had indirectly gotten the idea from
<br>
Tsiolkovsky, but he said that Shklovsky gave him his first copy
<br>
of Tsiolkovsky's writings in the early '60s after he had written
<br>
the Dyson shell paper.

<p>Ooooh, now this is useful! I wasn't aware of this.  Thanks heaps Doug!
<br>
<p>The link that I provided in one of my previous notes on the Dyson
<br>
Shell Retrospective that I did for the OSETI III conference goes
<br>
through all of the stuff I mention above in laborious detail so
<br>
its now part of the public record.
