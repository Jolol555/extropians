<em>&gt; So there's no sociological basis for beauty (or in his reaction, for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<p>Hi Buzz,
<br>
<p>There's a sociobiological basis for beauty, but no purely sociological basis
<br>
for it, because sociology derives from biology and is influenced by
<br>
environmental factors such as food, climate, geology, etc. The cascade of
<br>
interactions among molecular biological influences (including the effects of
<br>
shared psychoactive chemicals), social transactions, memetics, and
<br>
neurological changes resulting from cognitive imprinting (conditioning), make
<br>
complex adaptive systems (including humans) subject to evolutionary
<br>
developments determined by their entire past histories, especially their
<br>
genetic record. In short, one does not admire people because they are
<br>
beautiful; people are beautiful because one is genetically predisposed to
<br>
admire them.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have never seen such an ugly woman,&quot; says the Bushman, commenting on
<br>
stereotypical beautiful blonde in The Gods Must Be Crazy. Genetic
<br>
predisposition or cultural conditioning? Neither! It was a joke. The Bushman
<br>
was preoccupied with other matters and not feeling the least bit horny, that's
<br>
all. In real life people are attracted to what their genes determine, despite
<br>
heroic (or cowardly, depending on how you look at it) efforts to modify and
<br>
curtail this behavior. For example, religious fanatics have tried for
<br>
millennia to diminish (if not abolish) human sexuality. Some people (Marx and
<br>
Freud for instance) have constructed elaborate belief systems to transcend
<br>
what they consider biological determinism. IMO, a more practical approach
<br>
would transcend biology by genetic engineering (rather than by denying the
<br>
biological basis of moral and aesthetic preferences).
<br>
<p>Mundane humans may find the borg repulsive not because of cultural training,
<br>
but because the borg has modified its genetic structure and content. Knowing
<br>
this allows us to avoid wasting time trying to convert congenital luddites.
<br>
It's not a question that yields to reason, because people believe what they
<br>
want to believe, which is what they're genetically predisposed to believe.
<br>
IOW, some of us are biologically programmed to want to transcend biology. Or
<br>
as Edward O. Wilson put it in Consilience, The Unity of Knowledge, &quot;Homo
<br>
sapiens, the first truly free species, is about to decommission natural
<br>
selection, the force that made us.... Soon we must look deep within ourselves
<br>
and decide what we wish to become.&quot;
<br>
<p>Building on the convergence of human biology with its artifacts, Ray Kurzweil
<br>
points out, &quot;An evolutionary process accelerates because it builds on its own
<br>
means for further evolution. Humans have beaten evolution. We are creating
<br>
intelligent entities in considerably less time than it took the evolutionary
<br>
process that created us. Human intelligence--a product of evolution--has
<br>
transcended it. So, too, the intelligence that we are now creating in
<br>
computers will soon exceed the intelligence of its creators.&quot;
<br>
<p>Emlyn &lt;<a href="mailto:emlyn@one.net.au?Subject=Re:%20The%20biological%20basis%20of%20the%20beauty%20meme&In-Reply-To=&lt;03a201c0e482$e9a41560$915d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">emlyn@one.net.au</a>&gt; uplifted the signal by summarizing:
<br>
&quot;There's the intelligence augmentation approach, where we add things to our
<br>
heads to make ourselves smarter, and those things allow us to conceive more
<br>
mods to make which will make us smarter still, loop. Note that this could be
<br>
biotech/nanotech enhancements, resulting in a purely biological being,
<br>
rather than the traditional cyborg concept.&quot;
<br>
<p>To which I'd add that the traditional cyborg concept doesn't remain
<br>
traditional for long when biotech accelerates biological evolution. I'm not
<br>
the first to envision a future in which nanobots (or suitable gene modifying
<br>
carriers) injected into a chimpanzee alter the 3% genetic material which
<br>
separates the hairy ape from the naked one, so that Mr. Hyde (the chimp)
<br>
morphs into Dr. Jekyll (the homo sap). Similarly, a super sapient cyborg could
<br>
evolve *overnight* from an ordinary human.
<br>
<p>What's the difference whether posthumans emerge from biologically transformed
<br>
humans or from Kurzweillian machine intelligence? Either approach affords
<br>
ample opportunity to reinstate the heritage of genealogical memories and
<br>
social identities that some of us would like to preserve (and some of us would
<br>
like to discard). It seems to me those who'd like to jettison the cultural
<br>
baggage of the past have a slight advantage due to their willingness to try
<br>
something entirely new and physically different. But first we need to
<br>
understand in minute detail how our genes got us where we are. Otherwise we
<br>
may go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde, causing irreparable damage along the way.
<br>
Furthermore, we have no evidence that the AI path leads anywhere that we can
<br>
follow. Hyper-accelerated bio-evolution, in contrast, simply takes a proven
<br>
methodology and speeds it up so that we remain incarnate, although out of
<br>
control (in the Kevin Kelly sense of &quot;out of control&quot; -- meaning that our
<br>
future selves will decide how we will evolve in the future). Or as one wag has
<br>
written, &quot;Inside every older person is a younger person wondering what the
<br>
hell happened.&quot;
<br>
<p>ô¿ô
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
<br>
<p>--J. R.
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
