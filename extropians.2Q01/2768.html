<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;But to answer your question I am boycotting goods made in China
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;as a result of the incident involving our EP-3 surveillance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;aircraft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This falls back into the question of why harm random Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because a few Chinese who do things you think are wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Boycotting Chinese goods hurts Chinese workers, investors, (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;corrupt officials), and, most of all, hurts you.  The PRC army
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;isn't going to be affected. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the PLA is one of the largest industrial conglomerates in
<br>
China. However, the point is that it is a fiction to presume that every
<br>
Chinese person doesn't bear some responsibility for the actions of their
<br>
government, not by sins of commission, but by sins of omission. Being
<br>
satisfied with being a serf or slave is the reason why the communist
<br>
party is still in power. The soviet union fell because the people got
<br>
tired of being punished economically by the west for being so agreeable
<br>
to serfdom. So long as the Chinese people get fatter and happier, they
<br>
will seek no significant change in their system, they will get more and
<br>
more nationalistic, and their government will get more and more
<br>
belligerent.
<br>
<p>Just as we are shutting Cuba out of the Free Trade Area of the Americas
<br>
for being non-democratic, we should be similarly treating China. Revoke
<br>
its 'most favored' trade status.
