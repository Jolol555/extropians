There's a look at the making of this game at ZDNet GameSpot,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/features/pc/btg_bw/index.html">http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/features/pc/btg_bw/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>Below I quote the opening paragraphs, which have nothing to do
<br>
with the game but amused me in an odd way,
<br>
<p>&quot;Thirty minutes south of London, the Guildford Cathedral
<br>
towers over the rolling countryside and dwarfs the rest of
<br>
this tiny village. Perched on Stag Hill, a favorite hunting
<br>
spot for the King of England in the 1300s, the 70-year-old
<br>
cathedral boasts the highest Sunday morning congregation
<br>
attendance in all of England. It's a majestic sight, usually
<br>
crowned by a golden angel weather vane on the roof. The vane
<br>
serves as a beacon, which can be seen for miles on end.
<br>
<p>Today, the angel is missing.
<br>
<p>Step inside the cathedral, and you can't help but feel as
<br>
though you're living in a fairy tale: The church feels out of
<br>
place, yet perfectly set on the landscape as though someone
<br>
swooped in from above and plopped it down in the middle of a
<br>
sea of green grass. Inside, the 15-foot-tall angel is
<br>
unearthed, stripped of its gold leaf and ready for regilding.
<br>
But there's more: In addition to being restored, the angel
<br>
will be retrofitted with a cell phone antenna inside its
<br>
hollow core. The local cell phone company, One 2 One Digital,
<br>
has agreed to pay for the restoration so that it can put its
<br>
5-meter-high antenna inside.&quot;
<br>
<p>No doubt people will come from miles around to marvel at this
<br>
angels miraculous cell phone reception.
<br>
<p>As for the game, while I think it would do this burgeoning
<br>
medium good to have another title immediately follow The Sims
<br>
in garnering public attention, there's a huge barrier to entry
<br>
in requiring a relatively high-end graphics card.  Computer
<br>
and video games have been largely ignored (with the brief
<br>
exception of the Siliwood convergence fad), but as far as I
<br>
know they're the only digital medium to be both making money
<br>
on the Internet and ultimately immune to piracy (when used in
<br>
conjunction with streaming content, which cannot be fully
<br>
captured due its non-linear nature).
