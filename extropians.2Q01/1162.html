<p>If that's true then I have to believe the upcoming Planetary
<br>
Society launch is going to be a real disappointment.  I cannot
<br>
believe that a Russian ICBM is going to be able to get a sail
<br>
into very high orbit.
<br>
<p>Also, can someone explain this 51 degree thing and why it is
<br>
a &quot;commie&quot; orbit?  Also, is 0 degrees over the equator or
<br>
over the poles?  And can we get some costs and molecular densities
<br>
for higher orbits?  My read on some on the Shuttle pages that
<br>
are in my &quot;Space Station&quot; pages suggests that the payload
<br>
capacity to the station is almost half that of LEO.  Is that
<br>
just because its higher or is that because we have it in
<br>
an orbit that the Russians can get to too?  What about the
<br>
Arriane 5 -- does that have an greater or lesser cost than
<br>
the Shuttle or the Proton on lifting mass to the ISS?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
R.
