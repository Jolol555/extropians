<p>Apart from a few foundations, which must remain immutable, lest the whole

memetic building collapse into random rubble (or, losing tracking, floats

away in the evening breeze) you'll find very few static dogmas here.

<p><em>&gt; Eugene mentions basic unquestionable motivations, not rooted in
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survive, and wanting to reproduce are examples of two perhaps most
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I do not necessarily want to reproduce. For some weird reason, I want to
<br>
live forever, though, or at least die trying. (I grant that one tiny voice
<br>
to my DNA). You can assume this is an immutable cornerstone. It might
<br>
appear random, and wanting, but I stand by it. Life is good, death is bad.
<br>
I could imagine worse origins to base my framework of reference upon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fundamental concepts are life and scarcity. Scarcity implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition, competition implies adaptation. Scarcity is an essence of
</em><br>
<p>All very nice, but adaptation only means death in the darwinian framework.
<br>
If we're not limited to the darwinian framework, death becomes an option,
<br>
instead of default.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the universe (as far as we know), while the odds of the long-term

</em><br>
<em>&gt; far-fetched and notional, but it still implies some concepts such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation of better forms of life, continuous improvement, expansion,
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with going Lamarckian, and _becoming_ better forms of life?
