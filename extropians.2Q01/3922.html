<p>Because it embodies, to a degree, a mode of operation which
<br>
some (not all, I'll grant you) neuroscientists have come to
<br>
believe is the key to intelligence not just in human beings
<br>
but in all animal nervous systems.  I can supply references,
<br>
if you're interested; if not, that's cool too!

<p><em>&gt; If you want to make a straight hardware comparison to the human

</em><br>
<p>I don't buy that it's possible, at this stage, to make a
<br>
&quot;straight hardware comparison&quot; to the human brain without
<br>
begging a lot of questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who cares if we haven't done something as long as we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that its possible (realizing that any argument to the contrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be invoking magic)?  It took mankind a while to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powered flight as well.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody cares, unless they're in a particular hurry, or have
<br>
an emotional investment in believing that it's got to be done
<br>
in a particular way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Give me a processor that can properly utilize as many transistors as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain has neurons, and it would be a fair comparison.
</em><br>
<p>No it wouldn't -- not by a damn sight.  Your processor would still
<br>
come up way short.
