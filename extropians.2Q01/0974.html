<em>&gt; Three years ago I put together some of my own predictions for the period 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2000-2015, with comments from the list:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch2/scnrio1.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>I wrote a very negative response to this two years ago, a year after
<br>
Greg prepared his predictions, at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q99/0950.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.2Q99/0950.html</a>
<br>
<p>However I have to admit that it now looks like Greg has come much closer
<br>
to the mark than I thought possible at the time, for a number of his
<br>
predictions.  In particular I would revise:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; : Computer Technology (Processing, Interface, Software, Networks): 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : Interfaces: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : flat screens become common; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : first practical consumer VR interfaces; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : retina painters become available in some industrial applications; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : speech input becoming more common, especially with palmtops; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : crude VR avatars/virtual spaces available 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of these will happen by 2003. Flat screens will probably still be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive; there will be no head mounted displays in use for consumer VR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (they make people sick); no retinal painters will be used in industry;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech input will be rare, except for simple voice recorders. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be VR avatars, but there already are online interactions where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you control an avatar.
</em><br>
<p>Actually flat screens are becoming much more common than I expected;
<br>
they are still substantially more expensive than CRTs but the space
<br>
and weight savings and the &quot;cool&quot; appearance of the screens is making
<br>
up for this.  I don't think they will outsell CRTs for the next year
<br>
or two but undoubtedly will do so eventually.  One late 2000 reference
<br>
I found is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-201-3249742-0.html">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-201-3249742-0.html</a>: &quot;LCD's
<br>
big premium over the CRT and competition from other devices will help
<br>
to dampen demand from holiday shoppers this year. As a result, the home
<br>
market will not achieve a high penetration rate this holiday season,
<br>
even with the price drops.  The professional market, however, will likely
<br>
accept this premium to save desk space. As the price and performance gap
<br>
between LCDs and CRTs narrows even more, the big wave of buyers for LCDs
<br>
in the short term will be businesses, with the home market coming next.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also it looks like there might be some retinal painters in use by
<br>
industry within the next couple of years.  One company, Microvision,
<br>
<a href="http://www.mvis.com/retscandisp.htm">http://www.mvis.com/retscandisp.htm</a>, is coming out later this year or
<br>
next year with a head mounted display retinal painter called Nomad.
<br>
They have a press release from last September reporting their first
<br>
pre-order for Nomad.  Actually it is not an industrial application but
<br>
rather a display system for people with poor vision.  But I'm sure they
<br>
will get some industrial orders in the next year or two.
<br>
<p>Pushing against this technology is progress in the competing technology
<br>
of ultra-small conventional displays, essentially arrays of laser diodes.
<br>
<p>I also think Greg has come surprisingly close on:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; : Software: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : first consumer-level remembrance agents; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : first consumer-level personalizable full-time network spiders 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know what remembrance agents are, but I don't think we'll see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full time network spiders for end users. They would be too inefficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be useful.
</em><br>
<p>The network spider prediction is becoming realized in a sense with some of
<br>
the peer-to-peer (P2P) applications that people are working on.  It's not
<br>
exactly spidering a la AltaVista, but some systems, like OpenCola, are
<br>
planning on sharing files, sharing bookmarks and hot links, and finding
<br>
other people on the net who have common interests.  There are also some
<br>
efforts involving distributed search engines along the same lines.
<br>
<p>Greg also predicted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; : Communication Technology: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : cell phones the size of credit cards; a few disposable cell phones; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No disposable cell phones (in the sense of throwing them away; you may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to rent them while travelling, etc., but you'll have to return them)
</em><br>
<p>He forwarded this article from the L.A. Times about a disposable cell phone:
<br>
<em>&gt;     <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/cutting/ttimes/20010308/t000020343.html">http://www.latimes.com/business/cutting/ttimes/20010308/t000020343.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>That's pretty amazing, although I'm still skeptical that this will really
<br>
make commercial sense.  A step in this direction I have recently seen
<br>
advertised is a phone with a disposable battery.  You use it up and
<br>
throw the battery away.  It remains to be seen whether true disposable
<br>
cell phones will begin to be used.  Certainly this one has come a lot
<br>
closer than I expected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; : first practical consumer videophones; major consumer items (cars, houses) begin to have embedded cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : communications; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No videophones; no cars or houses with embedded cell phones 
</em><br>
<p>Some GM cars have wireless communications in the &quot;OnStar&quot; system, which
<br>
is based on cell technology.  Actually OnStar began appearing in GM cars
<br>
in late 1997, so I was pretty dumb to say that it wouldn't happen when
<br>
I wrote in 1999.
<br>
<p>Another counter-prediction I would revise is:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; : Genetic Science and Technology: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : human cloning bans enforced; first human clone announced in lab in Latin America or Asia; s 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No human clones. 
</em><br>
<p>It now appears at least reasonably possible that there will be a human
<br>
clone within the next two or three years, whether via the much-publicized
<br>
Italian effort or from some lower-profile group.  (It almost seems like
<br>
the Italians are going out of their way to cause trouble - maybe they
<br>
are a lightning rod?)
<br>
<p>Overall I have to say that I am impressed by the number of items which
<br>
Greg has gotten right or come close on.  And his &quot;circa 2000&quot; surely
<br>
gives him another year or two on the others.  While I still don't agree
<br>
with most of his predictions, I have to congratulate Greg for sticking
<br>
his neck out and coming close to the mark on quite a few of them.
