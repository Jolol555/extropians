<p>
I think this might be of some use to a few of the naive among us 
<br>
Libertarians.
<br>
<p><p>THE RULES OF DISINFORMANTION--THE POLITICIAN'S CREDO
<br>
<p>Note:
<br>
The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are
<br>
generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist
<br>
to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the
<br>
leadership, key players, or planning level of the organized crime syndicate
<br>
we know as government.
<br>
<p><p>1.  Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know,
<br>
don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc.
<br>
If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p>2.  Become incredulous and indignant./ Avoid discussing key issues and
<br>
instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being
<br>
critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as
<br>
the &quot;How dare you!&quot; gambit.
<br>
<p>3.  Create rumor mongers./ Avoid discussing issues by describing all 
<br>
charges,
<br>
regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other
<br>
derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method
<br>
works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public
<br>
can learn of the facts are through such &quot;arguable rumors&quot;. If you can
<br>
associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a
<br>
&quot;wild rumor&quot; which can have no basis in fact.
<br>
<p><p>4.  Use a straw man./ Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's
<br>
argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the
<br>
opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists
<br>
based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation,
<br>
or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their
<br>
significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the
<br>
charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of
<br>
the real issues.
<br>
<p>5.  Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule./ This is also known
<br>
as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as
<br>
variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such
<br>
as &quot;kooks&quot;, &quot;right-wing&quot;, &quot;liberal&quot;, &quot;left-wing&quot;, &quot;terrorists&quot;,&quot;conspiracy
<br>
buffs&quot;, &quot;radicals&quot;, &quot;militia&quot;, &quot;racists&quot;, &quot;religious fanatics&quot;, &quot;sexual
<br>
deviates&quot;, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear
<br>
of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.
<br>
<p>6.  Hit and Run./ In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent
<br>
or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be
<br>
fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet
<br>
and letters-to -the-editor environments where a steady stream of new
<br>
identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism reasoning
<br>
-- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and
<br>
never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the 
<br>
opponent's
<br>
viewpoint.
<br>
<p>7.   Question motives./ Twist or amplify any fact which could so taken to
<br>
imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other
<br>
bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the
<br>
defensive.
<br>
<p>8.  Invoke authority./ Claim for yourself or associate yourself with
<br>
authority and present your argument with enough &quot;jargon&quot; and &quot;minutiae&quot; to
<br>
illustrate you are &quot;one who knows&quot;, and simply say it isn't so without
<br>
discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources.
<br>
<p>9.   Play Dumb./ No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered,
<br>
avoid discussing issues with denial they have any credibility, make any
<br>
sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a
<br>
conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.
<br>
<p>10.   Associate opponent charges with old news./ A derivative of the straw
<br>
man usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make
<br>
charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with. Where it
<br>
can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it
<br>
dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent
<br>
charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be
<br>
associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash
<br>
without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the
<br>
opponent is or was involved with the original source.
<br>
<p>11.  Establish and rely upon fall-back positions./ Using a minor matter or
<br>
element of the facts, take the &quot;high road&quot; and &quot;confess&quot; with candor that
<br>
some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have
<br>
seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply
<br>
greater criminalities which, &quot;just isn't so.&quot; Others can reinforce this on
<br>
your behalf, later. Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for
<br>
&quot;coming clean&quot; and &quot;owning up&quot; to your mistakes without addressing more
<br>
serious issues.
<br>
<p>12.   Enigmas have no solution./ Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events
<br>
surrounding the issue, and the multitude of players and events, paint the
<br>
entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following
<br>
the matter to begin to loose interest more quickly without having to address
<br>
the actual issues.
<br>
<p>13.   Alice in Wonderland Logic./ Avoid discussion of the issues by 
<br>
reasoning
<br>
backwards with an apparent deductive logic in a way that forbears any actual
<br>
material fact.
<br>
<p>14.  Demand complete solutions./ Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to
<br>
solve the problem at hand completely, a ploy which works best for items
<br>
qualifying for rule 10.
<br>
<p>15.  Fit the facts to alternate conclusions./ This requires creative
<br>
thinking unless the act was planned with contingency conclusions in place.
<br>
<p>16.   Vanishing evidence./ If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you
<br>
won't have to address the issue.
<br>
<p>17.  Change the subject./ Usually in connection with one of the other ploys
<br>
listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or
<br>
controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more
<br>
manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can &quot;argue&quot;
<br>
with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to
<br>
avoid discussing more key issues.
<br>
<p>18.  Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents./ If you can't do anything
<br>
else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses
<br>
which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and
<br>
generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you
<br>
avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their
<br>
emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by
<br>
then focusing on how &quot;sensitive they are to criticism&quot;.
<br>
<p>19.   Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs./ This is perhaps a
<br>
variant of the &quot;play dumb&quot; rule. Regardless of what material may be
<br>
presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and
<br>
demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist,
<br>
but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be
<br>
safely destroyed or withheld, such as a shredded govt. study). In order to
<br>
completely avoid discussing issues may require you to categorically deny and
<br>
be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are
<br>
acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other
<br>
authorities have any meaning or relevance.
<br>
<p>20.  False evidence./ Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues
<br>
designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations as useful
<br>
tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best
<br>
when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the
<br>
facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications.
<br>
<p>21.  Call a parliamentary committee study, Supreme court test, or other
<br>
empowered investigative body.// Subvert the (process) to your benefit and
<br>
effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without true public input. Once
<br>
convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be acceptable to the
<br>
committee/court as evidence when properly handled, damaging evidence can be
<br>
discarded. For instance, if you own the judicial/committee officials, it can
<br>
insure an official hearing hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is
<br>
sealed, refused or buried and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once
<br>
a favorable verdict (usually, this technique is applied to find the govt.
<br>
innocent, but it can also be used to obtain authority when seeking to extend
<br>
govt. powers) is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed.
<br>
<p>22.  Manufacture a new truth./ Create your own expert(s), group(s), 
<br>
author(s),
<br>
leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via
<br>
scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes
<br>
favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so
<br>
authoritatively.
<br>
<p>23.   Create bigger distractions./ If the above does not seem to be working
<br>
to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of
<br>
unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them
<br>
as such) to distract the multitudes.
<br>
<p>24.  Silence critics./ If the above methods do not prevail, consider
<br>
removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the
<br>
need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their meeting
<br>
with an accident, an arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their
<br>
character by release of damaging information, or merely by proper
<br>
intimidation with blackmail or other threats.
<br>
<p>25.   Vanish or seek less contentious employment./ If you are a key holder
<br>
of dirty secrets or otherwise overly operationally illuminated and you think
<br>
the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. Find a
<br>
cozy non controversial plumb in the public or private sector (secured with
<br>
your party loyalty) and evade the heat your policies have created. Or if you
<br>
really F****ED up a lot of people....vacate to a third world dictatorship
<br>
that understands your brand of politics where your tax swollen bank account
<br>
will allow you to live like a king.
