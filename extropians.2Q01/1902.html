National Science Foundation boosts cognitive neuroscience
<br>
<a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/nsf.html">http://www.apa.org/monitor/nsf.html</a>
<br>
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has established a major new emphasis on
<br>
cognitive neuroscience, setting aside $10 million from its 2001 budget to
<br>
support basic research in the fast-growing field and to promote efforts to
<br>
strengthen its infrastructure. As early as next year, the foundation may
<br>
establish cognitive neuroscience as a formal, permanent program area.
<br>
<p>The new allocation represents about 8 percent of total research funding within
<br>
NSF's Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences and about 16
<br>
percent of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences' budget. No
<br>
program area within that division is larger.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's tremendously exciting,&quot; says Temple University psychologist Nora
<br>
Newcombe, PhD, who conducts research on spatial cognition and navigation.
<br>
&quot;This opens the field up for people to be focused on the basic science and on
<br>
building theory.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the past, researchers interested in the link between the brain and behavior
<br>
have been rooted in the medical sciences, working to understand the role of
<br>
the central nervous system in illnesses such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
<br>
diseases and schizophrenia. Most public funding for cognitive neuroscience
<br>
research in the United States has come from the National Institutes of Health.
<br>
<p>But now, &quot;researchers are starting to come to grips with much more basic
<br>
cognitive processes that are not tied to diseases,&quot; says Steven J. Breckler,
<br>
PhD, director of NSF's social psychology program and acting program director
<br>
for cognitive neuroscience.
<br>
<p>&quot;They're looking at fundamental questions such as how the brain accomplishes
<br>
memory, thought and reasoning, or how our brains allow us to navigate in the
<br>
world,&quot; he explains. &quot;Some of these questions have been answered in
<br>
health-related research, but now the field has gotten to a place where it
<br>
wants to take on those questions head-on.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cognitive neuroscience research, with its reliance on sophisticated equipment
<br>
and need for specialized technical support, tends to be far more expensivethan
<br>
most other areas of behavioral research. A single experiment using functional
<br>
magnetic resonance imaging, for example, can nearly exhaust an investigator's
<br>
annual NSF grant budget.
<br>
<p>To accommodate cognitive neuroscientists' needs, NSF plans to use up to half
<br>
of its $10 million cognitive neuroscience allocation to bolster existing
<br>
disciplinary programs that support research in the area, including its
<br>
programs in human cognition, social psychology, linguistics and physical
<br>
anthropology.

<p>Everything that can happen has already happened, and not just once, but an
<br>
infinite number of times. This will continue forever.
