<p>PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
<br>
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
<br>
Number 531  March 22, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein,
<br>
and James Riordon
<br>
<p>A CARBON NANOTUBE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT, with a
<br>
thousand nanotubes acting like transistors, has been devised by
<br>
Phaedon Avouris of IBM (914-945-2722, <a href="mailto:avouris@us.ibm.com?Subject=Re:%20update.531%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.10103231644520.132-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de&gt;">avouris@us.ibm.com</a>). 
<br>
Nanometer-wide tubes made of carbon chickenwire have for some
<br>
years expected to become an active ingredient in electronics (see
<br>
Scientific American for December 2000).  Besides their strong
<br>
mechanical properties, nanotubes have a variety of attractive
<br>
electrical properties.  Nanotubes, for example, can sustain current
<br>
densities hundreds of times greater than that of common metals,
<br>
and are created in both metallic and semiconducting form. 
<br>
Speaking at last week's APS meeting in Seattle, Avouris described
<br>
how, in a mixed batch of nanotubes, one can short out the metallic
<br>
nanotubes (with a surge of voltage) while leaving the
<br>
semiconducting ones intact for use as circuit elements.  Other
<br>
nanotube highlights from the same meeting:  David Tomanek of
<br>
Michigan State (517-355-9702, <a href="mailto:tomanek@pa.msu.edu?Subject=Re:%20update.531%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.10103231644520.132-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de&gt;">tomanek@pa.msu.edu</a>) said that
<br>
experimental measurements of nanotube heat conductivity went as
<br>
high as 3000 watts/m/K, almost as high as that of diamond.  He
<br>
predicted that nanotube performance would reach levels of 6600
<br>
watts/m/K.  The ability to conduct heat will come in handy for
<br>
future circuits needing to dispose of lots of heat from tight places. 
<br>
Mathieu Kociak of the CNRS lab, University of Paris-South (33-
<br>
169-155-342, <a href="mailto:kociak@lps.u-psud.fr?Subject=Re:%20update.531%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.10103231644520.132-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de&gt;">kociak@lps.u-psud.fr</a>) announced the first
<br>
observation of superconductivity in nanotube ropes (see also
<br>
Kociak et al., Physical Review Letters, 12 March 2001; get text at
<br>
<a href="http://www.aip.org/physnews/select">http://www.aip.org/physnews/select</a>).   &quot;This represents the first
<br>
observation of superconductivity in a system with such a small
<br>
number of conduction channels,&quot; said Kociak, referring to the
<br>
meager material substrate over which the supercurrent must flow,
<br>
namely the aggregate of essentially two-dimensional surfaces of 
<br>
nanotubes.  The researchers hope to raise the transition
<br>
temperatures, presently only 300-400 mK, through judicious
<br>
doping.  John Hafner of Harvard reported using single nanotubes
<br>
(with diameters of .9-2.8 nm) as extensions on the ends of atomic
<br>
force microscope probes.  Not only does this narrow the probe
<br>
profile, resulting in greater spatial resolution when imaging a
<br>
variety of biomolecules (such as immunoglobulins) but, when used
<br>
to seek out specific molecules on a sample surface, the nanotube
<br>
probe could help in studying tip-sample adhesion.  Hafner referred
<br>
to this approach as &quot;chemical force microscopy&quot; (CFM).  Finally, 
<br>
Masako Yudasaka of the NEC lab in Japan (81-(0)298-50-1190,
<br>
<a href="mailto:yudasaka@frl.cl.nec.co.jp?Subject=Re:%20update.531%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.10103231644520.132-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de&gt;">yudasaka@frl.cl.nec.co.jp</a>) reported on the enormous pressures that
<br>
arise when C60 molecules are encased inside nanotubes (an
<br>
arrangement called &quot;peapods&quot; the force on the C60 is only a
<br>
nano-Newton, but by dividing by the area of the tube, one arrives
<br>
at a pressure of .1 giga-Pascal.  In other words the buckyball can
<br>
act like a piston for facilitating novel forms of tailored chemistry. 
<br>
Yudasaka also described her work with nanotubes that flare out
<br>
like cones (typical size: 2 nm small diameter, length of 50 nm, and
<br>
opening angle of 20 degrees).  These &quot;nano-horns&quot; might be useful
<br>
for absorbing gases (replacing other forms of activated carbon in
<br>
filters).
<br>
<p>MOLECULAR BEACONS FOR CANCER.  Aiming to detect
<br>
cancers early, safely, and inexpensively, Britton Chance of the
<br>
University of Pennsylvania (215-898-4342,
<br>
<a href="mailto:chance@mail.med.upenn.edu?Subject=Re:%20update.531%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.10103231644520.132-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de&gt;">chance@mail.med.upenn.edu</a>) and his colleagues have created
<br>
&quot;molecular beacons,&quot; tiny capsules that are opened by specific
<br>
biochemical activity related to a tumor.  At the APS March
<br>
Meeting, Chance described molecular beacons designed to detect
<br>
1-2 mm sub-surface breast tumors inexpensively and without
<br>
ionizing radiation.  Injected into the body, the capsules remain
<br>
sealed until opened by specific enzymes associated with breast
<br>
cancer. The beacons then fluoresce near-infrared light in response
<br>
to light beaming from a small device outside the body.  That same
<br>
device then detects the signal from the beacons.  (The beacons emit
<br>
enough near-infrared light so that some of it gets through the
<br>
body.)  The device is designed to cost only several thousand
<br>
dollars, Chance said, and is based on off-the-shelf CD and cell-
<br>
phone technology. The molecular beacon has successfully been
<br>
tested in mice, and human tests are planned.  The technique does
<br>
not require uncomfortable compression of the breast, which is
<br>
what often is required for women under 40 years of age who
<br>
receive mammograms.  Self-tests for breast cancer may eventually
<br>
be possible with this technique, Chance said.
<br>
<p>USING THE MOON AS A COSMIC RAY DETECTOR.  Some
<br>
of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray neutrinos striking the Moon's
<br>
soil are expected to set up shock waves of Cerenkov radiation, the
<br>
light given off by particles (in this case charged particles spawned
<br>
by  neutrinos) traveling faster than light itself in that medium (see
<br>
schematic drawing at <a href="http://www.aip.org/mgr/png">http://www.aip.org/mgr/png</a>).  For the
<br>
cosmic rays of greatest interest, those with an energy above 10^20
<br>
eV, the Cerenkov radiation peaks in the microwave region of the
<br>
electromagnetic spectrum.  To test the validity of this &quot;Askaryan
<br>
effect&quot; (named for the Armenian-Russian scientist Gurgen
<br>
Askaryan), a consortium of scientists (David Saltzberg, 310-206-
<br>
4542, <a href="mailto:saltzberg@physics.ucla.edu?Subject=Re:%20update.531%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.10103231644520.132-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de&gt;">saltzberg@physics.ucla.edu</a>; Peter Gorham,
<br>
<a href="mailto:peter.w.gorham@jpl.nasa.gov?Subject=Re:%20update.531%20(fwd)&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.03.10103231644520.132-100000@sun1.lrz-muenchen.de&gt;">peter.w.gorham@jpl.nasa.gov</a>) have shot gamma rays into a bed of
<br>
sand at the SLAC Final Focus Test Beam.  Sure enough, the
<br>
expected coherent microwaves appeared.  The scientists are
<br>
pointing two JPL radio telescopes (part of the Deep Space
<br>
Network) toward the Moon to look for such radiation from cosmic
<br>
ray neutrinos.  Right now their calibration involves pointing at
<br>
distant quasars, but it would be nice to have some source of
<br>
microwave pulses on the Moon itself, a luxury not possible at
<br>
present.  Some of the more optimistic estimates place the number
<br>
of possible 10^20 eV cosmic ray neutrino events as high as one
<br>
every 10 to 20 hours or so.     (Saltzberg et al., Physical Review
<br>
Letters, 26 March; text at <a href="http://www.aip.org/physnews/select">http://www.aip.org/physnews/select</a>;

<br>
ml)  By the way, in this week's issue of Nature, members of the
<br>
AMANDA collaboration report the observation of cosmic-ray
<br>
neutrinos, also via the emission of Cerenkov radiation, but in this
<br>
case the detectors are buried in Antarctic ice (Andres et al., Nature,
<br>
22 March 2001.)
