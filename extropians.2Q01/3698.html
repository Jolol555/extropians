<p><em>&gt;This is basically for Brian, since he is the person who first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expressed his thoughts on GRED.  With a bit more sensitivity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your situation, let me explain that the capitalized letters GERD
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sound more appealing and my doc suggested GERD to saying the acid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the somach is entering the mouth. While you, Brian seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;watching your condition while experienced the downside of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illness, many people do have it. Some to a greater degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than others, and whatever the cause - obesity, ulcer, gastritus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spastic colon, lazy stomach, deficient production of saliva,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nervousness, anxiety, too much chocklate, etc., - it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treated.
</em><br>
<p>The interesting thing about GERD is that it seems to involve a
<br>
disfunction of the enteric nervous system. That and the fact that
<br>
it is on a dramatic increase in just the last few years.
<br>
<p>Most pesticides are in effect neurotoxins, and we know from cell
<br>
research that the human immune system will react to manmade
<br>
chemicals, chemicals that did not previously exist in nature. Since
<br>
everyone is different, it is reasonable to assume that suceptible
<br>
members of the population will have negative reactions to new
<br>
substances in the enviroment, I would think particularly if taken
<br>
internally.
<br>
<p>The increase in new cases points to a change, what that change is,
<br>
is the question.
<br>
<p>My point other than a personnal example is that any bad effects
<br>
caused by a GMO might not be immediately recognized, they could be
<br>
more gradual.
<br>
<p>Do have to watch the chocolate though.... ;)
