<p><em>&gt; For example, suppose that you're on a game show called &quot;ExtroQuiz&quot; and

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; empty.  What is the probability that the prize is behind door B?  Answer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0%.  Why?  Because the game show host *knows* the standard answer to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; riddle, *knows* that most Extropians will switch to B, and he opens A *if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and only if* the prize is actually behind C.
</em><br>
<p>This is a tricky game that illustrates how very poor is the human
<br>
brain for understanding stochastic processes.  The door switching
<br>
strategy holds only if Monte *always* opens a zonk door and
<br>
gives you a chance to switch.
<br>
<p>Imagine the game is restated thus: you pick door C.  Then Monte
<br>
says &quot;Eliezer, if I agree to reveal door B, will you switch to door A?&quot;
<br>
Then one is left second guessing a possibly malevolent game host.
<br>
<p>Since we are discussing probabilities and things that can easily
<br>
be calculated, heres one for you:  suppose you choose a number
<br>
randomly (x), you know that the probability of its being prime
<br>
is about 1/ln(x).  OK, suppose you pick two random primes and
<br>
multiply them together to get a composite C.  What is the probability
<br>
that C+2 is prime?  Is it still 1/ln(C+2) ?
<br>
<p>The answer to this is not trivial, and it bears directly on the discussion
<br>
on page 87 of Damien's updated version of The Spike.  spike
