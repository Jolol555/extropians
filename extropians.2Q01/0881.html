<p>Well, I was under the impression (I think from Zubrin's writings)
<br>
that the ISS is a boondoggle designed to justify the Shuttle.
<br>
The shuttle is a vehicle designed to employ astronauts which
<br>
in turn justifies large numbers of support staff, shuttle prep
<br>
teams, etc. etc.
<br>
<p>I've organized a URL (below) that distills a bunch of stuff.
<br>
The reason that this is costing so much and taking so long
<br>
is precisely because NASA needs to find something that makes
<br>
work for the astronauts and the shuttle.
<br>
<p>So if you are going to &quot;make work&quot; one way to do that is
<br>
to make them put things together in space.  You don't want
<br>
automated docking (&quot;assembly&quot;?) as the Russians have demonstrated
<br>
seems feasible.  You also don't want &quot;unpiloted&quot; robotic
<br>
flying of the shuttle (as the Russians have also demonstrated
<br>
is feasibile).
<br>
<p>It would have taken 6 or 7 Energia based flights to ferry up the
<br>
parts instead of the 44+ that NASA is planning for the Shuttle.
<br>
That means the parts could have been pre-assembled and tested
<br>
here on Earth and you wouldn't have all those photo-ops in space.
<br>
<p>It seems pretty clear to me that NASA could have designed
<br>
and built a new heavy lifter and gotten the station launched
<br>
for a lot less than what this boondogle is going to cost.
