<p>Thanks for clearing up that mystery (and try to forgive my ignorance
<br>
about Bruce Springsteen ;-&gt; )!  I guess there aren't many &quot;deuce
<br>
coupes&quot; (1932 Ford coupes) on the roads anymore, but here's a picture
<br>
of one:

<br>
<p>Oh, in case anybody's interested, these creatively misheard
<br>
lyrics are called &quot;mondegreens&quot;, named after the transformation
<br>
of
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh, they have slain the Earl of Murray
<br>
And laid him on the green.&quot;
<br>
<p>to
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh, they have slain the Earl of Murray
<br>
And Lady Mondegreen.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think my favorite is the version of the Lord's Prayer containing
<br>
the line &quot;...and lead us not into Penn Station...&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are more at <a href="http://www.verbatimreporters.com/jcr/0101/0101_lederer.htm">http://www.verbatimreporters.com/jcr/0101/0101_lederer.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Any lit/lang lore floating around in my head (including this example)
<br>
is likely to have been put there by my friend F, who pays much more
<br>
attention to such things than I do ;-&gt; .
<br>
