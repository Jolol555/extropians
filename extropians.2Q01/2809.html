Hi all,
<br>
<p>Some of you might remember that a way back, I mentioned the band &quot;The Land
<br>
Canaan&quot; (myself &amp; my wife, Jodie) on the list... thanks for the positive
<br>
responses from many of you.
<br>
<p>Finally, the album is available! It's called &quot;On leaving&quot;, and it's
<br>
available *exclusively* through mp3.com.
<br>
<p><a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/42/the_land_canaan.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/42/the_land_canaan.html</a>
<br>
<p>You can download all the tracks, or you can be lovely and buy the CD. I'll
<br>
make a list of all purchasers, and if I upload first, I'll bring you all
<br>
with me. That's got to be worth a few ducats :-) Plus there's a beautiful
<br>
image of the Whirlpool galaxy on the cover. If enough people shell out cash,
<br>
you might even make it to extro5, where you might easily convince me to hum
<br>
you a few bars :-)
<br>
<p>Anyone who has positive comments about the album, please don't feel that you
<br>
have to send them to me privately... I'm not too shy to accept public
<br>
endorsement and praise. OTOH, if you don't like it, you are more than
<br>
welcome to keep that to yourself.
<br>
<p>Emlyn
<br>
<p>btw - Many of you will click with our only &quot;cover&quot; song (much altered!),
<br>
Wild Child. 1 gram of computronium goes to the first person who can work out
<br>
the original band &amp; song (please allow some decades for delivery). I've
<br>
included the lyrics below (which are modified from the original a tad); all
<br>
lyrics for the album are available at the link above, and inside the cd
<br>
cover.
