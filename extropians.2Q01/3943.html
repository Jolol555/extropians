If traditional odiferants cause problems in fuel cells, don't use 
<br>
traditional odiferants
<br>
<p>surely someone can come up with substitutes...

<br>
<p>Methane high-temp cells with nickel electrodes are pretty much immune to

<br>
<p>In any case, one would want to generate the hydrogen locally, either from

methane, using existing natural gas infrastructure, or from water via
<br>
electrolysis or photolysis, which renders above arguments nilpotent.
