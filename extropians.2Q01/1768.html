I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;your last 5 minutes of conscious experience is equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to the right program going through a few billion states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on the cpu or biological organism of your choice.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Next, that is equivalent [it is alleged], in turn, to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;big lookup table [where] no information flows between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;states!  They are not linked by cause and effect!

<p><em>&gt; This is incorrect, as all you've done is describe a finite state

</em><br>
<p>I do not understand how you are disagreeing.  To anticipate:
<br>
yes, some lookup table is _functionally_ equivalent to any
<br>
program.  That is my point.  Although functionally equivalent,
<br>
or &quot;logically reducible&quot; as you say, it turns out that in this
<br>
bizarre case, we do not have moral equivalence.  I don't think
<br>
that I need another lecture on computation theory, so let me
<br>
try to get to the core of our disagreement, if there is one,
<br>
<p>this way:
<br>
<p>Suppose that God has made an incredible, enormous lookup
<br>
table that only returns what James Rogers does in any 
<br>
millisecond between 2001/03/31/17:50 and 2001/03/31/17:55
<br>
given one particular Earth exceedingly similar to ours.
<br>
Because the details may be important, I'll provide a few,
<br>
but it's very similar to the Eugene Leitl lookup table.
<br>
This is a &quot;pure lookup&quot; table, which God can make using
<br>
His infinite wisdom.
<br>
<p>Let's say that you expect to enjoy that interval of time,
<br>
that, for example, during it you get to read the fascinating
<br>
conclusion to a murder mystery that's been absorbing you for
<br>
weeks.  Now if it is known that you will be replaced by the
<br>
lookup table at that time---that the mechanical causation
<br>
your brain now enjoys, each state being calculated from a
<br>
prior state by the laws of physics, gets replaced by this
<br>
system in which each state (and a tiny output action) is
<br>
rather arbitrarily linked to the next (plus input)---do
<br>
you still anticipate the enjoyment of that novel; do you
<br>
still expect to be alive or aware during that interval
<br>
of time?  Yes or no?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; At each second of the hike, or of your own last 5 minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conscious experience, we merely form a 30 bit address made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from (i) 10 bits of input that you are getting at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; current millisecond (ii) 20 bits specifying the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that you are in.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The addressing is incorrect.  You've confused the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of clock cycles executed during the last five minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which is small) with the astronomical number of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states.  You could create a hash table of all the states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used in the last five minutes and discard the rest (so that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can meet your bit depth requirement), but then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have a model that was perfectly useless.
</em><br>
<p>What?  Perhaps you misread me.   Now I do need to apologize
<br>
to anyone reading this exchange: I was confusing powers of
<br>
ten with powers of two (not a mistake of principle). I will
<br>
reword, and try to supply reasonable numbers. I should've said:
<br>
<p>At each millisecond of your last 5 minutes' conscious experience,
<br>
we merely form a 90 bit address made from (i) 30 bits of input
<br>
that you are getting from your physical surroundings (ii) 60
<br>
bits specifying your current state.  [I forgot that a human
<br>
can be in but about 10^20 different states, which corresponds
<br>
roughly to 60 bits, not 20.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can't logically say that consciousness must run on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite state machine AND have lookup tables not be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce consciousness.  This is the same as saying that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [functionally] equivalent programs are not equivalent where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is concerned, which I have a very hard time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swallowing (a=b and a=c, but b!=c?).
</em><br>
<p>Here I think that you understand just how apparently outrageous
<br>
<p>what I'm saying is.  (Except the algebraic rendition, which is
<br>
silly of course.)  Yes: two functionally equivalent programs
<br>
are not entirely the same; it means something to be one of
<br>
them, but not the other.  That's why (because of this peculiar
<br>
detail concerning lookup tables) I'm not a functionalist anymore.
