</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  Good.  Something to focus in on.  The 'biggie' is Loss of Humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, as you put it moments later, &quot;you won't retain human values.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The words 'humanity' and 'human values' are code words
</em><br>
<p>#Don't look for concealed meanings; there are none.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;for 'someone else's
<br>
<em>&gt; idea of what constitutes humanity' and 'someone else's idea of what values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are 'right' values'.  I'm not buying it.  It's a veiled attempt to dictate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my choice of values for myself.
</em><br>
<p>#Not at all. By definition, of course, a human is the best judge of 
<br>
human values. At the moment, we're on equal footing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is filled with uncertainty and risk.
<br>
<em>&gt; How I choose to confront these realities is, for the most part, nobody's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business but my own.
</em><br>
<p>#Couldn't agree more.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I say 'for the most part' because, clearly, choices I
<br>
<em>&gt; make for myself will inevitably have some impact on others.
</em><br>
<p>#Now we're getting warm...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
<br>
<em>&gt; that's always been the case.
</em><br>
<p>#True--but the actions of posthumans could instantly affect the 
<br>
entire human race, which will most likely be incapable of halting 
<br>
things it sees as undesirable by &quot;its&quot; value-standards. So, we're 
<br>
talking a different ball game now.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But choosing transhumanism for myself, even
<br>
<em>&gt; doing so 'recklessly', is not the same as forcing transhumanism on others.
</em><br>
<p>#This would seem correct; no prob. You do however seem to assume I 
<br>
don't wanna be superhuman. Bad assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet you, John, (and those 'others') don't hesitate for a moment to arrogate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right, and presume the legitimacy, of forcing their 'correct' humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and their 'correct' values on me.
</em><br>
<p>#I stand maligned. I have never said you must do (or refrain from 
<br>
doing) what I (or anyone else) tells you. Never. I've no idea where 
<br>
you're getting this. Again, there are no hidden meanings or code-
<br>
words here.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I respect your right to choose your own
<br>
<em>&gt; values and your own path.
</em><br>
<p>#Thanks; ditto here.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll take care of mine, thankyouverymuch,
<br>
<em>&gt; perhaps recklessly, perhaps boldly. 
</em><br>
<p>#Uh-huh; no prob. Except...
<br>
<p>#Here is THE point: The views you've just expressed (and fine views 
<br>
they are)--me do my thing, you do yours, we don't mess with each 
<br>
other, etc.--are by definition an expression of HUMAN VALUES. Good 
<br>
ones, too.
<br>
<p>#HOWEVER--once you become posthuman (and no one seems to really know 
<br>
just what that means), you (or anyone else becoming posthuman, myself 
<br>
included) MAY CEASE TO POSSESS VALUES WHICH CAN BE REMOTELY DESCRIBED 
<br>
AS &quot;HUMAN.&quot;
<br>
<p>#You may in fact become something you would, were you to see it now, 
<br>
despise, or find alien. The human values which led you to choose your 
<br>
path and leave others free to choose theirs may no longer apply--may 
<br>
be meaningless, even incomprehensible to you. You might, in fact, 
<br>
view them as irrational or contemptible, not worthy of consideration--
<br>
as many here view the &quot;values&quot; of the &quot;greens.&quot; 
<br>
<p>#Do you see what I mean? To take an obvious example, rhesus monkeys 
<br>
would rather be pursuing their own path through the trees than 
<br>
strapped to a vivisection table or infected with simian AIDS--but of 
<br>
what import is this to the researcher who wields the blade or needle? 
<br>
The monkey is not human, and so it is viewed as raw material for 
<br>
whatever research the more intelligent &quot;postmonkey&quot; sees fit.
<br>
<p>#I suggest that posthumans may in fact view humans with no greater 
<br>
respect than that accorded monkeys by humans.
<br>
<p>#This may well be a baseless concern, but NO ONE KNOWS--not me, and 
<br>
not you. What troubles me is that no one else seems to give the 
<br>
matter the slightest consideration. Everyone wants to GET THERE, but 
<br>
no one knows WHERE &quot;there&quot; is--and no one seems to CARE!
<br>
<p>#It may not be a place we wish to go.
<br>
<p>#This is what I'm describing as &quot;reckless.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, returning briefly to 'humanity' and 'human values', just what are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these? 
</em><br>
<p>#Humanity is us. One example of human values would be the &quot;you do 
<br>
your thing, I do mine&quot; attitude you express above--and which Max 
<br>
expresses in EP 3.0.
<br>
<p><p>...Shall we then, in light
<br>
<em>&gt; of this honest accounting, ask what of our 'humanity' and 'human values'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserves preserving?
</em><br>
<p>#Certainly; we'd be fools not to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question of loss of humanity is, at best, grounded in ignorance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudice and primitive fear, and presumes, based on an historical fantasy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moral and rational correctness of the current state of affairs.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst it is a devious and deceitful ploy to maintain control, based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historically effective but lately tattered idea that God and Ceasar know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's right and therefore you must obey.  
</em><br>
<p>#This is totally off-base; nothing whatsoever to do with what I'm 
<br>
talking about.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanism is merely the current manifestation of the ancient quest to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand and progress.
</em><br>
<p>#What I see is a desire to PROGRESS without UNDERSTANDING. Again--
<br>
reckless.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That's 'progress' as in 'to make things better'.
<br>
<p>#Hopefully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Are we likely to stumble along the way?  Well, duh.)  Thus, transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is FUNDAMENTALLY ethical.
</em><br>
<p>#Ethics is a human value concept. The relevant question is this: Is 
<br>
POSThumanism ethical?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We are unsatisfied with, unimpressed by, and
<br>
<em>&gt; unwilling to meekly accept the limitations on justice, freedom, ethics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion, health, intelligence, and personal fullfillment, imposed on our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'humanity' by the accidents of biology.
</em><br>
<p>#Great. What about those which may be imposed by posthumans--or AIs, 
<br>
for that matter?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the criticism of my
<br>
<em>&gt; critics.
</em><br>
<p>#Will your posthuman self?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I celebrate their freedom to criticize.
<br>
<p>#Will your posthuman self?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I celebrate my
<br>
<em>&gt; freedom to dismiss the strident protests of the misguided and misinformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to shrug off the looming umbrage of their masters.
</em><br>
<p>#What if we--if you--are not the first to become posthuman, and you 
<br>
consider those who are misguided and misinformed. Just what, exactly, 
<br>
are you going to do about it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My mind is my own.
<br>
<p>#Only because other humans cannot take it from you. Will this be true 
<br>
when posthumans enter the equation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is the heart of Transhumanism.  That is what makes it unstoppable.
</em><br>
<p>#Ah, yes! This is the point! Whatever posthumanism turns out to be, 
<br>
it will likely be unstoppable.
<br>
<p>#So don't you think it's about time we began devoting some serious 
<br>
f*cking thought to what we WANT it to be..? And what we DON'T..?

&gt; Then, in response to Greg's
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Saying that you could hurt a group of people by picking out the least 
&gt; &gt;&gt; appealing members of the group and then depicting them as representative
&gt; is 
&gt; &gt;&gt; true but, with respect, so what?
&gt; 
&gt;   John writes,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;#I'm warning that someone will eventually do this--that some sort of 
&gt; &gt;etiquette is going to have be enforced on the public list or you're 
&gt; &gt;going to run into trouble. Yeah I know that flies in the face of the 
&gt; &gt;freedom-to-post-anything stance, but there it is.
&gt; 
&gt; Trouble is inevitable.  It's practically a definition of the human
&gt; condition.  What's the alternative, to huddle, trembling beneath your
&gt; bedclothes?  Freedom has its price.  If it's trouble, then BRING IT ON!
&gt; No other way to get past it.
