<em>&gt; Or not. Despite living off the IT industry -- working as a programmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and freelance IT journalist-- I'm not entirely sanguine about its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall benefits for the human condition. (Sometimes it all looks like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a horrible distraction ... lots of wheel-spinning which is essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marketing bullshit rather than the engine of progress in motion.) We're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning the wrong lessons from it: that we can make progress by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Powerpoint presentation, that companies can win in the marketplace by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacking their competitors with spurious patent-infringement lawsuits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on.  (Read up on NCR sueing Palm this week for violating a 1987
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patent on a handheld data terminal that NCR never built. Or Rambus up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in court and being sandbagged with RICO.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What you listed are not problems with IT itself but with human nature
<br>
and human ethics.  I don't believe we can get the real benefits of
<br>
technology, current or future, without seriously cleaning up some of our
<br>
ethical systems and the legal, political and economic spheres that grow
<br>
out of them.  Technology won't fix that for us.  There I agree.  But
<br>
without the technology but with wonderful ethics we still wouldn't fare
<br>
very well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope. Human problems usually turn out to have human solutions: the tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we use in reaching those solutions are incidental, although they often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make life a lot easier. But ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But technology is also a &quot;human solution&quot;.  The tools are NOT
<br>
incidental.  Not if they have the power to transform our base
<br>
assumptions, like our assumptions of fundamental scarcity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Scarcity is not just an issue of lack of resources or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production capacity, it is also an issue of distribution and economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system. Under a Rob Mugabe even a nanotech society might starve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but you missed another thing: in a nanotech society, scarcity may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a function of broken intellectual property laws, inadequate education,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a government that can't attract capital investment inflow, and probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half a dozen other factors we don't know about yet. Distribution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic problems are a hallmark of the industrial and mass production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; era. We're going somewhere else ... talk about &quot;mass customization&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only the tip of the iceberg.
</em><br>
<p>So scarcity when real scarcity is gone is a function of broken ethics -
<br>
of replaying old human (actually old chimp) games long after the context
<br>
is there for the to have any meaning or be at all safe to play.  Well,
<br>
either we will get over that or our tools will hyper-inflate our
<br>
nonsense until we either do ourselves in or create a hopefully more
<br>
reasonable successor fit for the new context.
