These days the 'new' economy (p/e ratios &gt;&gt; 40) is getting 'old'
<br>
(p/e ratios &lt; 20) and, fortunately, the 'old' economy is getting
<br>
''new' (AOL-Time Warner, the Vivendi-Yahoo! hypothesis, etc.).
<br>
<p>Herewith a very smart speech by the Oracle of Omaha: Mr. W.E. Buffett,
<br>
(feb, 28th )
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2000ar/table00.html">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2000ar/table00.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
But I will tell you now that we have embraced the 21th century by entering
<br>
such cutting-edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint. Try to
<br>
control your excitement.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>Leaving aside tax factors, the formula we use for evaluating stocks and
<br>
businesses is identical. Indeed, the formula for valuing all assets that are
<br>
purchased for financial gain has been unchanged since it was first laid out
<br>
by a very smart man in about 600 B.C. (Though he wasn't smart enough
<br>
to know it was 600 B.C.).
<br>
<p>The oracle was Aesop and his enduring, though somewhat incomplete,
<br>
investment insight was &quot;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.&quot; To
<br>
flesh out this principle, you must answer only three questions. How certain
<br>
are you that there are indeed birds in the bush? When will they emerge and
<br>
how many will there be? What is the risk-free interest rate (which we
<br>
consider to be the yield on long-term U.S. bonds)? If you can answer these
<br>
three questions, you will know the maximum value of the bush - and the
<br>
maximum number of the birds you now possess that should be offered for it.
<br>
And, of course, don't literally think birds. Think dollars.
<br>
<p>Aesop's investment axiom, thus expanded and converted into dollars, is
<br>
immutable. It applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks,
<br>
lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants. And neither the advent of the
<br>
steam engine, the harnessing of electricity nor the creation of the
<br>
automobile changed the formula one iota - nor will the Internet. Just insert
<br>
the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible
<br>
uses of capital throughout the universe.
<br>
<p>Common yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings or
<br>
to book value, and even growth rates have nothing to do with valuation
<br>
except to the extent they provide clues to the amount and timing of cash
<br>
flows into and from the business. Indeed, growth can destroy value if it
<br>
requires cash inputs in the early years of a project or enterprise that
<br>
exceed the discounted value of the cash that those assets will generate in
<br>
later years. Market commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to
<br>
&quot;growth&quot; and &quot;value&quot; styles as contrasting approaches to investment are
<br>
displaying their ignorance, not their sophistication. Growth is simply a
<br>
component - usually a plus, sometimes a minus - in the value equation.
<br>
Alas, though Aesop's proposition and the third variable - that is, interest
<br>
rates - are simple, plugging in numbers for the other two variables is a
<br>
difficult task. Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a
<br>
range of possibilities is the better approach.
<br>
<p>Usually, the range must be so wide that no useful conclusion can be reached.
<br>
Occasionally, though, even very conservative estimates about the future
<br>
emergence of birds reveal that the price quoted is startlingly low in
<br>
relation to value. (Let's call this phenomenon the IBT - Inefficient Bush
<br>
Theory.) To be sure, an investor needs some general understanding of
<br>
business economics as well as the ability to think independently to reach a
<br>
well-founded positive conclusion. But the investor does not need brilliance
<br>
nor blinding insights.
<br>
<p>At the other extreme, there are many times when the most brilliant of
<br>
investors can't muster a conviction about the birds to emerge, not even when
<br>
a very broad range of estimates is employed. This kind of uncertainty
<br>
frequently occurs when new businesses and rapidly changing industries are
<br>
under examination. In cases of this sort, any capital commitment must be
<br>
labeled speculative.
<br>
<p>Now, speculation ¾ in which the focus is not on what an asset will produce
<br>
but rather on what the next fellow will pay for it - is neither illegal,
<br>
immoral nor un-American. But it is not a game in which Charlie and I wish to
<br>
play. We bring nothing to the party, so why should we expect to take
<br>
anything home?
<br>
<p>The line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and
<br>
clear, becomes blurred still further when most market participants have
<br>
recently enjoyed triumphs. Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of
<br>
effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible
<br>
people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know
<br>
that overstaying the festivities - that is, continuing to speculate in
<br>
companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely
<br>
to generate in the future - will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But
<br>
they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party.
<br>
Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before
<br>
midnight. There's a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the
<br>
clocks have no hands.
<br>
<p>Last year, we commented on the exuberance - and, yes, it was irrational -
<br>
that prevailed, noting that investor expectations had grown to be several
<br>
multiples of probable returns. One piece of evidence came from a Paine
<br>
Webber-Gallup survey of investors conducted in December 1999, in which the
<br>
participants were asked their opinion about the annual returns investors
<br>
could expect to realize over the decade ahead. Their answers averaged 19%.
<br>
That, for sure, was an irrational expectation: For American business as a
<br>
whole, there couldn't possibly be enough birds in the 2009 bush to deliver
<br>
such a return.
<br>
<p>Far more irrational still were the huge valuations that market participants
<br>
were then putting on businesses almost certain to end up being of modest or
<br>
no value. Yet investors, mesmerized by soaring stock prices and ignoring all
<br>
else, piled into these enterprises. It was as if some virus, racing wildly
<br>
among investment professionals as well as amateurs, induced hallucinations
<br>
in which the values of stocks in certain sectors became decoupled from the
<br>
values of the businesses that underlay them.
<br>
<p>This surreal scene was accompanied by much loose talk about &quot;value
<br>
creation.&quot; We readily acknowledge that there has been a huge amount of true
<br>
value created in the past decade by new or young businesses, and that there
<br>
is much more to come. But value is destroyed, not created, by any business
<br>
that loses money over its lifetime, no matter how high its interim valuation
<br>
may get.
<br>
<p>What actually occurs in these cases is wealth transfer, often on a massive
<br>
scale. By shamelessly merchandising birdless bushes, promoters have in
<br>
recent years moved billions of dollars from the pockets of the public to
<br>
their own purses (and to those of their friends and associates). The fact is
<br>
that a bubble market has allowed the creation of bubble companies, entities
<br>
designed more with an eye to making money off investors rather than for
<br>
them. Too often, an IPO, not profits, was the primary goal of a company's
<br>
promoters. At bottom, the &quot;business model&quot; for these companies has been the
<br>
old-fashioned chain letter, for which many fee-hungry investment bankers
<br>
acted as eager postmen.
<br>
<p>But a pin lies in wait for every bubble. And when the two eventually meet, a
<br>
new wave of investors learns some very old lessons: First, many in Wall
<br>
Street - a community in which quality control is not prized - will sell
<br>
investors anything they will buy. Second, speculation is most dangerous when
<br>
it looks easiest.
<br>
<p>At Berkshire, we make no attempt to pick the few winners that will emerge
<br>
from an ocean of unproven enterprises. We're not smart enough to do that,
<br>
and we know it. Instead, we try to apply Aesop's 2,600-year-old equation to
<br>
opportunities in which we have reasonable confidence as to how many birds
<br>
are in the bush and when they will emerge (a formulation that my grandsons
<br>
would probably update to &quot;A girl in a convertible is worth five in the
<br>
phonebook.&quot;). Obviously, we can never precisely predict the timing of cash
<br>
flows in and out of a business or their exact amount. We try, therefore, to
<br>
keep our estimates conservative and to focus on industries where business
<br>
surprises are unlikely to wreak havoc on owners. Even so, we make many
<br>
mistakes: I'm the fellow, remember, who thought he understood the future
<br>
economics of trading stamps, textiles, shoes and second-tier department
<br>
stores.
<br>
<p>Lately, the most promising &quot;bushes&quot; have been negotiated transactions for
<br>
entire businesses, and that pleases us. You should clearly understand,
<br>
however, that these acquisitions will at best provide us only reasonable
<br>
returns. Really juicy results from negotiated deals can be anticipated only
<br>
when capital markets are severely constrained and the whole business world
<br>
is pessimistic. We are 180 degrees from that point.
<br>
<p>[For the record: Berkshire's Corporate annual average performance, after
<br>
taxes, was 23.6%, during 35 years!]
