<p>
Folks,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still considered a member of the LDS church, and most of
<br>
my friends and family are also Mormon.  Evidently many of my friends
<br>
and family think the LDS church is against Cryonics, and hence they,
<br>
are hostile to the idea.  Here is a draft of a letter I intend on
<br>
sending to my current LDS bishop, in an effort to find out what, if
<br>
any, support, or lack there of, I might expect from the LDS church.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone else ever attempted something like this?  I'd be
<br>
interrested in hearing any feedback anyone might have, on my intention
<br>
of asking this of my LDS bishop.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
<br>
<p><p>==================================================================
<br>
<p><p>Dear Bishop &lt;name removed&gt;,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got a question for you.  As I believe you know, I'm in
<br>
the process of signing up for cryonic preservation.  From the
<br>
extropian point of view, it's unfortunate that the laws of the land
<br>
are not set up a little more fairly for cryonic &quot;patients&quot;, which some
<br>
people consider mere &quot;corpses&quot;.  Because of this, legal threats from
<br>
family, state, or even religious organizations and their members,
<br>
especially if they are family members, can be a significant threat to
<br>
the extropian community that desires to be cryonically preserved.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compounding the problem, when the patient most needs it, when
<br>
the time comes, he is unable to stand up for, or even communicate in
<br>
person, his own desires.  Hence in anticipation of such we must make
<br>
extra effort to anticipate all possible eventualities, and try to plan
<br>
for them in advance, so that there is the minimal possible threat to
<br>
our possible survival unto the age when there is no more death and
<br>
people live forever.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as you know, most of my family and friends are LDS.  It
<br>
seems to be a popular belief in the LDS church that &quot;Once the prophet
<br>
has spoken, the thinking has been done.&quot;  Many members seem to value
<br>
the teachings of the church over their own thinking.  So, it is my
<br>
feeling that it is important to me to try to find out, before it is to
<br>
late, the church's position on members seeking to be cryonically
<br>
preserved, and any possible effect such might have on my family,
<br>
friends or even the voting people in a state which I might be residing
<br>
when I die.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my belief, there should be no conflict whatsoever between
<br>
making every medical effort possible to live as long as possible.
<br>
But, evidently many LDS, including some in my family, believe the
<br>
church's position is to choose death, and to be against anything that
<br>
might eventually give eternal life.  Because of many people's self
<br>
perceived idea that the church is against this, they seem to be very
<br>
hostile to the idea of my seeking after this.  To the point that I
<br>
fear for my life because of the actions, or lack of actions that any
<br>
of these people could take when the time comes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcor is the name of the organization that I have selected to
<br>
provide this service for me.  On Alcor's &quot;Application For Membership&quot;
<br>
form there are section where supporting people and organizations can
<br>
be entered.  There is a &quot;Contacts&quot; section where close friends that
<br>
may be able to help in time of need can be listed.  For example, Alcor
<br>
may require simple assistance for something like having someone go
<br>
around to pick up large quantities of ice to help with the procedure.
<br>
There is also a &quot;Suspension Endangerment Contacts&quot; section.  Here is
<br>
the description from the form for that section:
<br>
<p>) Suspension Endangerment Contacts.
<br>
) In case of large financial expenditures being required to fight
<br>
) legal attacks on your suspension, general financial or legal
<br>
) set-backs which threaten the suspensions of all Members in
<br>
) suspension, or the dissolution of Alcor it may be necessary for
<br>
) Alcor to convert the suspension from Whole Body Suspension to
<br>
) Neurosuspension or to terminate the suspension.  As a safety
<br>
) measure, you may designate certain individuals(s), organization(s),
<br>
) and/or institution(s) as Suspension Endangerment Contacts.  Such a
<br>
) designation does not create a contract with the Suspension
<br>
) Endangerment Contacts on the part of either the Member or Alcor.
<br>
) Such Contacts might include individuals or organization you have
<br>
) left funds with for the specific purpose of providing a back-up fund
<br>
) for your cryonic suspension.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am asking is: would it be appropriate for me to ask the
<br>
LDS church to be one of these Contacting organizations?  To me, such
<br>
would be an indicator as to whether the church is hostile to people
<br>
seeking after eternal life, or would the church be supportive and not
<br>
try to interfere with members seeking after such?  I know of no other
<br>
way to find out such information, other than by asking if it would be
<br>
OK, for me to put the LDS church, and you as my Bishop, or an official
<br>
representative of the church, on this form as a &quot;Suspension
<br>
Endangerment Contact&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, could I inform my Home Teachers of my desires,
<br>
and can I ask them if it is OK to add them, as official Home Teachers
<br>
of the LDS church, to the &quot;Contacts&quot; list on this form, and keep the
<br>
form updated with whoever my current Home Teachers, and Bishop are?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it says on the form, there is no contract, whatsoever,
<br>
committing anyone on such lists to do anything on my or Alcor's behalf
<br>
when the time comes.  For me, it would simply be a critically
<br>
important explicit show of an indication that, even if you do not
<br>
happen to believe in cryonics, that you will not try to take action to
<br>
prevent this from occurring.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hard to imagine all possible eventualities that might
<br>
become relevant in the future.  But for example, being autopsied is a
<br>
big danger to extropians.  In many states, it is the law that under
<br>
certain circumstances, a body must be autopsied after death.  Having
<br>
the brain autopsied like this, as far as Alcor and extropians are
<br>
concerned, is equivalent to murder.  There are legal teams in place to
<br>
do all they can to try to prevent such.  Having my bishop testify on
<br>
Alcor's behalf in court, as evidence that it is was truly my will to
<br>
be preserved, and not be autopsied, could be life saving to me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any kind of court action ensued, for any reason, of which
<br>
the above is just one possible example, I feel it is critical that I
<br>
no, now, which side of the court people will be on.  Will the church,
<br>
and my family members, vote to pass laws which take away the rights of
<br>
people with such desires?  If there was a court case, involving me
<br>
being preserved, what side would my LDS family members be on?  Would
<br>
they be for or against me?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, I've been a member of the LDS church my entire
<br>
life.  Though I don't believe in all the teachings and practices of
<br>
the church, I do all I can to support my family in the Church.  I've
<br>
been a full tithe payer my entire life, held multiple church jobs most
<br>
of my life, I served a mission, primarily because of my
<br>
parents... and so on and so forth.  It is my desire to continue this
<br>
support of my family, for as long as is required and as long as this
<br>
is their choice.  But my question is, is it within the church's
<br>
teachings to behave similarly in return?  I know many LDS do not
<br>
think to highly of Cryonic Preservation.  But, will they try to make
<br>
efforts to frustrate my will?  Or does the church really teach things
<br>
like: &quot;Let them worship how where and what they may&quot;?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect the Church has never considered such, and may not be
<br>
interrested in considering, simply on my behalf, giving you (and my
<br>
home teachers) the go-ahead to, as official representatives of the LDS
<br>
church, to be listed as supporting contacts on my Alcor Application.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, then I would desire to ask you (and my
<br>
home teachers) simply as friends to be listed as such.  Would this be
<br>
OK with you, or would you prefer to not be listed as such even as a
<br>
personal friend?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, I am also a member of the UU church.  Many UU
<br>
members are &quot;green&quot; people.  Some of their beliefs are that the world
<br>
would be much better if humans would just go away and stop polluting
<br>
nature.  Some of them believe that people seeking after eternal life
<br>
would be a bad thing.  Non the less, most of them support people
<br>
having their own will.  They will do anything to try to help their
<br>
will be fulfilled.  I've talked to my UU minister, Mark Salkin, about
<br>
this same issue and have made this same request.  The UU church is all
<br>
for having Mark Salkin, as a representative of the UU church, being
<br>
listed as a &quot;Suspension Endangerment Contact&quot;.  This simple fact gives
<br>
me great comfort and peace of mind, for this has indicated to me that
<br>
this is one less thing that I must worry about and try to put effort
<br>
towards anticipating.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it turns out that the LDS church is against seeking after
<br>
eternal life via medical research and such means as cryonic
<br>
preservation, or that many of it's members believe they should do
<br>
things like vote for laws making it very difficult for cryonics
<br>
patents to fulfill their will, or scientists to perform such research,
<br>
it is my feeling that continuing to support such an organization may
<br>
be akin to donating money to a terrorist group that has vowed to take
<br>
legal or perhaps even some of it's members to take terrorist actions
<br>
against Alcor, it &quot;patients&quot;, scientists doing any eternal life
<br>
research and so on.  And of course any such support wouldn't be to
<br>
rational for a person also paying money to an organization like Alcor
<br>
and giving support to the extropian community.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I'm not really sure how to go about all this, nor if
<br>
this is the best way to precede.  Perhaps you can provide some advice
<br>
as to how best to precede with all this?  I figured I'd at least start
<br>
with an e-mail like this.  I hope you can understand how important
<br>
this is to me.  I'm very excited over the idea that my UU friends, and
<br>
especially my Extropian and Alcor friends are willing to go to such
<br>
extreme efforts on my behalf.  Though I would appreciate it and though
<br>
I believe such would be precisely one of the purposes of &quot;home
<br>
teachers&quot;, I'm not really asking the Church, my LDS family and
<br>
friends, for anything like this.  All I'm really asking for is that
<br>
they give me some kind of indication, now before it is to late, that
<br>
they will not stand in the way of my other cherished infinitely loving
<br>
friends that are so willing to do so much for me.  Hopefully, when the
<br>
time comes, everyone will already know what is going to occur.
<br>
Hopefully things will go according to plan and I will be able to cover
<br>
the cost of all these efforts now.  I want to do all I can to have
<br>
this all set up in advance, so that everyone knows what to expect and
<br>
so things can go smoothly, and that if there are any risks or threats,
<br>
I might be able to address those now, while I can, before it becomes
<br>
to late.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Extropians that have the faith and hope that a
<br>
cure for aging might be discovered and achieved before any of this is
<br>
necessary.  They are certainly making dedicated efforts in this
<br>
direction, because of this faith.  I hope that you wild think that
<br>
such would be a very exciting worthwhile thing to hope for.  But since
<br>
an accident could occur at any time, I feel &quot;now is the time to
<br>
prepair&quot; and that it is not wise &quot;to procrastinate the day....&quot;
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
