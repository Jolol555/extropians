<p>Yes of course, but in this (rare) instance I was assuming no-nanotech.
<br>
I think I was commenting on Anders' game setup, which sounded like
<br>
there was no nanotech.  My Asteroid Mining Robot also doesn't need
<br>
nanotech (just lots of good microtech).  We also don't have rockets
<br>
that use TNT or C + O2 for fuel.  Yes we have ion drives but the
<br>
thrust is pretty low.  I was basically trying to parallize the
<br>
development paths -- we *can* go to space before nanotech with
<br>
microtech (and if we are clever about it, we can probably do
<br>
it without involving the government).
