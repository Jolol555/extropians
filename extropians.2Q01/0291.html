</em><br>
<p>That's true, and in keeping with the general theme of much of my thinking and 
<br>
writing these days, I think it is very important, as Jeff Davis pointed out 
<br>
recently, that we distinguish between &quot;discussion&quot; and &quot;debate&quot;.  All too 
<br>
often, people rush into conflict with people they identify as &quot;enemies&quot; 
<br>
without first stopping to consider the philosophical foundations of the 
<br>
positions they are defending.  This is essential given that one of the basic 
<br>
tenets of the developing &quot;neo-luddite&quot; and &quot;anti-globalist&quot; ideology is the 
<br>
belief and common accusation that proponents of scientific, technological and 
<br>
social progress uncritically follow an amalgam of values labeled as 
<br>
&quot;modernist&quot;.
<br>
<p>Thus it is all the more important to constantly think about and re-evaluate 
<br>
the most fundamental ideas, ideals and values that motivate us, as well as to 
<br>
be an &quot;activist&quot; in promoting progress.  Being clear-headed and open about 
<br>
our basic values and ideas serves a dual purpose.  On the one hand, it helps 
<br>
to ensure that we aren't in fact blindly supporting technological 
<br>
implementation of each new development that science offers and, on the other, 
<br>
it makes us more effective advocates.  The twelve years of Extropy 
<br>
Institute's history can be seen as an on-going process of evaluation and 
<br>
re-evaluation of a coherent and explicit set of moral values.  The evolution 
<br>
of the Extropian Principles during that time is, to me, tangible evidence 
<br>
that we are in fact being self-critical in our approach to the issues that 
<br>
concern us.  Thus, I agree with you, Charlie, that we should celebrate and 
<br>
welcome criticism of our ideas.  We do not want to be or be labeled as 
<br>
uncritical cheerleaders of technology for its own sake, but rather as 
<br>
proponents of a coherent and defensible set of values that improve the 
<br>
quality of life.
