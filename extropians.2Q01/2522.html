<em>&gt;From: Michael Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Made%20in%20China&In-Reply-To=&lt;200104171859.LAA08942@well.com&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;As a 15 year old boy, I worked for the laundry company owned by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neighbor. Not a cushy job either, I worked night shift, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minimum wage, loading and emptying huge dryers capable of holding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;300 lbs of laundry at a time. Hot work, no air conditioning. Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a fun job. Not once did I feel 'exlpoited', outside of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;miffed at not being allowed to work more than 8 hours a day...
</em><br>
<p>15 is not a child, it's a teenager who needs to learn the value of
<br>
hard work. Had plenty of tough jobs myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for abuse, while the neighbor was a freind of my parents, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I went to school with his kids, he was a real pain in the butt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Late in the summer, I wanted to take a week off to vacation with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the family. He said no, so I quit on him.
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly beaten is it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My next employer owned a farmers market. The sign on his door
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said,&quot;We'd like to pay you what you are worth, but minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laws make us pay you more.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That was a warning sign.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So in the two cases above of my first two jobs, was I 'exploited'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Was it unethical for people to buy the product of my labor?
</em><br>
<p>As I pointed out you were a teenager, and holding these jobs wasn't
<br>
the difference between living or dying was it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So if I bought produce from the same farmer's market that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'exploited' me, does that make me unethical?
</em><br>
<p>As I've pointed out you were a teenager, not a child.
