<em>&gt; &gt;The Libertarian Futurist Society has selected five novels as finalists for

<em>&gt; &gt;its annual Prometheus Award for Best Novel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... The Sky Road, by Ken MacLeod  (TOR Books)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... MacLeod won most recently in 1998 for ’&quot;The Stone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Canal&quot;, and in 1996 for ’&quot;The Star Fraction.&quot;.

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Ah, it's always so refreshingly ecumenical to find novels with Trotskyist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heroes and left-anarchic perspectives winning the award of the Libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Futurist Society. :)
</em><br>
<p>Having finished his tetralogy in the Star Fraction universe, I think the
<br>
prizes are well deserved: not just literary but also because he does
<br>
have a rather fresh perspective on libertarian themes. Each novel
<br>
presents a different perspective on events, and while only _The Stone
<br>
Canal_ has a politically libertarian protagonist I think the general
<br>
outcome of his analysis of events seems to be very libertarian in
<br>
outlook. It is not a simplistic libertarianism, but rather something
<br>
along Virginia Postrel's dynamism - the point is not whether you are an
<br>
anarchocapitalist, anarchosocialist or just practically minding your own
<br>
business, but whether you are open to change, freedom and responsibility
<br>
for your actions.
<br>
<p>As for his view on AI, which was debated earlier on this list, I think
<br>
he has an interesting if somewhat pessimistic point. The problem with
<br>
the AIs in the storyline are not that they are AIs, but that living on a
<br>
software timescale they change so fast and have so different reach that
<br>
it is hard to build reciprocal relations with them. This lack of
<br>
reciprocity makes trust impossible to sustain. The same goes with
<br>
posthumans; the storyline in the _Stone Canal_ (and some extra
<br>
information from _The Cassini Division_) implies that the big problem is
<br>
the isolation that (for various reasons) separated the people working on
<br>
the singularity from the rest, creating a serious cultural and
<br>
ideological rift. The future society depicted in the _Stone Canal_ that
<br>
emerges after the events surrounding the singularity has no real problem
<br>
with transhumans interacting with baseline humans in the same timescale,
<br>
but is vary of the uploaded &quot;fast people&quot; for the same reasons. 
<br>
<p>I think his &quot;Civis Britannis sum&quot; from _The Star Fraction_ has a good
<br>
point - libertarianism (in whatever form) might be necessary to protect
<br>
your rights, but after that you need to be a part of some kind of
<br>
society. Atomism/autarchy doesn't really work well, and fragmentation
<br>
limits trust and hence easily leads to mistrust and potential
<br>
atrocities.
