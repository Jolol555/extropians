<em>&gt; &gt; Well, when continental species get introduced to islands, it's sayonara

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I doubt Europa can match that, assuming it has any life at all, simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as there's far less usable energy there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But with the islands case, you have some species adapted to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific niche where there are no competitors and the incoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species are those from the larger continents where they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to compete and survive.  They generally come in with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better &quot;genes&quot; and that is why they win.
</em><br>
<p>But that's the point.  The assumption here is that any Europan life would
<br>
probably not have the competition Terrestrial life has had to face.  (This
<br>
is speculative, of course.  We might find no Europan life or perhaps the
<br>
Europan environment is more varied and any ecosystems there much more robust
<br>
than we imagine.)
<br>
<p>Also, Europan life would most likely be adapted to a limited set of
<br>
environments and there mgiht not be much movements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The proper comparison given your example is species coming into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an island just after it has been formed when there is no established
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecosystem to take advantage of.  In that situation the &quot;mainlanders&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have an easy time of it.  Only a very limited set of species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have evolved to deal with the resource poor conditions manage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a go of it.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, though on Earth, typically, the first species to land on a new
<br>
island are often birds just looking for a place to roost or spiders who eat
<br>
any insects that drop by.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the low energy availability you cite on Europa, the species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Earth that would manage to compete effectively are probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few and far between.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  Earth possesses many different microenvironments, some
<br>
more like Europa, such as Lake Vostok in the Antarctic.  Europa would seem,
<br>
prima facie, not to have such variations.  So, my bet would be that while
<br>
percentage-wise most Earth life would find Europa inhospitable, in terms of
<br>
raw numbers -- numbers of species and of organisms that might be able to
<br>
survive there -- Earth has Europa beat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The scientific insights that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be derived from any species that were discovered growing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such an environment would likely be very great.
</em><br>
<p>I see no need to contaminate Europa and think any ET life would add a lot to
<br>
our knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nothing like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few billion years of evolution under really poor conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make you tougher than steel...
</em><br>
<p>Well, if that's true, why haven't lichen overgrown Earth?:)  (There are many
<br>
other examples, but usually organisms that evolve to fit really tough --
<br>
which is a relative term anyhow; bacteria that survive in a low or no oxygen
<br>
environment often find it tough to survive in what we or E. coli would find
<br>
normal -- places are ones that were pushed out of other ones on Earth.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
