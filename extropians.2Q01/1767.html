</em><br>
<p>A birth defect is when the child would die when living regularly and unaided in the environment with the other
<br>
children, where they would not, on average.
<br>
<p>That's a major birth defect.
<br>
<p>Minor birth defects include cleft palates, and generally various other &quot;serious&quot; &quot;physical&quot; &quot;deformities&quot; where the
<br>
mutation or actual result of incompatible reproduction is not beneficial specifically to the individual.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Oh of course, I'm thinking more along the lines of Dr. Moreau.... ;) The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;problems can't be fixed unless research is allowed. All the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;legislation (and in other developed countries) is doing is ensuring that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the test subjects will be third worlders, under no legal protections...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Research needs to be done, but it needs to be done on primates.  The catch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of restricting research, of course, is people who currently want cloning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such as infertile couples, but may be too old to raise a child by the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's low-risk for people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One important ethical point, in relation to the infertile, is that our society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *absolutely* allows reproduction that puts the fetus at great risk, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; long as it's the only option for the parents.  Tay-Sachs or cystic fibrosis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; carrier couples can have children, even though they have a 1/4 risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; producing a child with defects far worse than what have come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cloning.  Huntingdon's carriers can reproduce with a 50% risk of a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nasty disease. Couples with serious fertility problems are downright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; encouraged to keep trying, even after multiple miscarriages show another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a virtual certainty.  Even when risk is avoidable - such as fetal alcohol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; syndrome - punishment is rare and severe punishment absent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If fetal risk requires barring cloning even for infertile couples, integrity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requires we shut down most infertility treatment and unleash the hounds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eugenics on carriers.  I don't want to do that, and I hope most other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't either.  Unfortunately, Congress isn't know for ethical integrity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is unnerving, though, that this ban would provide future precedent for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eugenics legislation.  The basic principle: that Congress may legislate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reproduction for the purpose of protecting good genetics, is the founding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principle of coercive eugenics.
</em><br>
<p>Basically, we can actually look forward to a relatively decent government.  I think this is because we do have
<br>
historians, and many old people.
